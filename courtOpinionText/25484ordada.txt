ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(ODC 00-383-6729)
ORDER OF REINSTATEMENT
(By:  Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the record and the Disciplinary
Board’s Report and Recommendation to Deny Melodie R. Aduja’s
Petition for Reinstatement to the Practice of Law, it appears
contrary to the Disciplinary Board’s Report and Recommendation,
that Petitioner Aduja’s violation of RSCH 2.16(h) while suspended
was technical and de minimis and that she did not practice law
while suspended.  It further appears that Petitioner Aduja has
proven, by clear and convincing evidence, rehabilitation, fitness
to practice law, competence, compliance with all applicable
disciplinary orders and rules, and compliance with other
requirements imposed by the court, as required by Rule 2.17(b) of
the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i.
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner Melodie R. Aduja’s
Petition for Reinstatement is granted and Petitioner Aduja is2reinstated to the practice of law in this jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that upon payment of all required
dues and registration fees, the Clerk shall restore Petitioner
Melodie R. Aduja to the roll of attorneys eligible to practice in
the State of Hawai# i.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 4, 2010.
