OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
RONALD G.S. AU, Respondent.
 
In re Application for Reinstatement of RONALD G.S. AU,
Petitioner.
 
(ODC 95-242-4701, ODC 97-213-5407, 98-064-5555)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR REINSTATEMENT
 
(By: 
Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, J.,
Circuit Judge Crandall in place of Acoba, J., recused,
Circuit Judge Trader in place of Duffy, J., recused,
and Circuit Judge McKenna, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of the “Disciplinary Board’s Report
 
and Recommendation Denying Reinstatement of Ronald G.S. Au to the
 
Practice of Law,” the record, and the briefs of the parties, it
 
appears that Petitioner Au was suspended from the practice of law
 
for 5 years, effective July 22, 2005. It further appears that
 
during the period of suspension, Petitioner Au represented
 
himself and a company, Gourmet Delite, Inc., in arbitrating
 
issues concerning a business lease, a violation of Rule 2.17(a)
 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i. 
Petitioner Au was entitled to represent himself in the 
arbitration, but he could not represent Gourmet Delite, Inc. See 
Oahu Plumbing v. Kona Construction, Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 590 P.2d 
570 (1979) and ODC v. Gould, 119 Hawai' i 265, 195 P.3d 1197 
(2008). Petitioner Au’s arguments that his representation of 
Gourmet Delite, Inc. was authorized by HRS chapter 658A are 
without merit. In light of Petitioner Au’s practice while 
suspended, we see no need to address in detail the other points 
raised by him, and merely note we find them without merit. In 
light of the above, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner Au’s Petition for
 
Reinstatement is denied.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner Au may not seek
 
reinstatement before December 31, 2012. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 10, 2011.
