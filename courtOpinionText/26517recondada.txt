'I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
RONALD G.S. AU, Respondent.
 
IN RE APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT OF RONALD G.S. AU,
Petitioner.
 
(ODC 95-242-4701, ODC 97-213-5407, 98-064-5555) 
ORDER DENYING RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, J.,
Circuit Judge Crandall in place of Acoba, J., recused,
Circuit Judge Trader in place of Duffy, J., recused,
and Circuit Judge McKenna, assigned by reason of vacancy) 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Ronald G.S. Au’s 
motion for reconsideration of the Supreme Court’s January 10, 
2011 order denying Respondent Au’s application for reinstatement, 
the memorandum, exhibits, and declaration in support thereof, and 
the record, it is clear that Respondent Au was not charged with 
unauthorized practice of law under HRS §§ 605-2 and 605-14, but 
was confronted with evidence he practiced while suspended, a 
violation of Rule 2.17(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the State of Hawai
'i (RSCH), and could not therefore prove compliance with all applicable disciplinary orders and rules, as
 
required by RSCH Rule 2.16. The record is replete with
 
Respondent Au’s arguments on the subject, contrary to his
 
contentions on reconsideration about notice and opportunity to be
 
heard. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is denied.
