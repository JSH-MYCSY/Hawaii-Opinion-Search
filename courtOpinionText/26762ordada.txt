OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
WILLIAM TAGUPA,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC CASE NO. 14-020-9163)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the report and recommendation submitted
 
by the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of
 
Hawai'i on July 29, 2015 in this matter, we find and conclude, 
based upon clear and convincing evidence, that this court’s
 March 3, 2005 order of suspension, enjoining Respondent 
William Tagupa from the practice of law, remains valid and
 continues to prohibit Respondent Tagupa from practicing law in
 this jurisdiction, and further find and conclude, in the first
 matter before the court, that in August, 2010 Respondent Tagupa
 formed an attorney-client relationship with Mr. K, a distant
 relative, and thereafter assisted Mr. K, through January, 2014,
 
with a civil rights proceeding and subsequent litigation
 regarding a wrongful discharge claim, by discussing the legal
 aspects of the claim, including interpreting relevant statutes
 and case law, performing legal analysis and developing legal
 
strategies, including, inter alia, arguments based upon statutes
 of limitation, the doctrine of preemption, rational
 
relationships, and disparate impact, advising Mr. K on deposition
 and discovery strategies, providing legal arguments for
 responding to a motion for summary judgment, drafting legal
 memoranda for use in the litigation, discussing settlement
 strategy and the characteristics of a valid settlement agreement,
 drafting a legal memorandum for Mr. K to use in a settlement
 conference in the federal litigation, advising Mr. K on an appeal
 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
 drafting an opening brief for use by Mr. K and his formal
 counsel, and drafting a reply brief which Mr. K submitted to the
 Ninth Circuit under his own name on January 14, 2014.
 
We decline to address the second matter in the Board’s
 
report, involving an application for a writ of certiorari to this
 court, as the matter was not alleged in the original petition.
 
Upon review of the above conduct, we conclude 
Respondent Tagupa engaged in the practice of law, in violation of this court’s injunction. See ODC v. Gould, 119 Hawai' i 265, 270, 
2
 195 P.3d 1197, 1202 (2008) and Fought & Co., Inc. v. Steel 
Engineering and Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai' i 37, 45, 951 P.2d 487, 
495 (1998); see also Gould, 119 Hawai' i at 271, 195 P.3d at 1203; 
Attorney Grievance Comm’n of Maryland v. Brisbon, 31 A.3d 110, 118 (Md. 2011); In re Chavez, 1 P.3d 417, 424 (N.M. 2000); Disciplinary Counsel v. Coleman, 724 N.E.2d 402, 404 (Ohio 2000); In re Conduct of Devers, 974 P.2d 191, 196 (Or. 1999); Kansas v. Schumacher, 519 P.2d 1116, 1121 (Kan. 1974); Edwards, Inc. v. Hert, 504 P.2d 407, 416 (Okla. 1972); Cf. Matter of Discipline of Jorissen, 391 N.W.2d 822, 825 (Minn. 1986). A suspended attorney is, indeed, under greater strictures than a layperson with regards to conduct that may constitute the practice of law. See 
Gould, 119 Hawai' i at 268-69, 195 P.3d at 1200-01; see also In re 
Martin
, 400 F.3d 836, 843 (10th
  Cir.2005);  In re Disciplinary
 
Action Against Larson
, 485 N.W.2d 345, 349 (N.D. 1992); State of
 
Nebraska ex rel. Nebraska State Bar Ass’n v. Butterfield, 111
 N.W.2d 543, 546-47 (Neb. 1961); Schumacher, 519 P.2d at 1122,
 1125. This is because, in contrast to a lay person, a suspended
 attorney applying legal skills to a matter gives the appearance
 of, and equates to, engagement in the practice of law. See Comm.
 
on Prof’l Ethics & Conduct of Iowa State Bar Ass’n v. Gartin, 272
 N.W.2d 485, 491-92 (Iowa 1978)).
 
Finally, we concur with the Hearing Officer’s
 
characterization of Respondent Tagupa as “intelligent and
 
3
 competent” with “legal research skills and analysis [which] are 
certainly quite good, if not superior,” and, hence, concur Respondent Tagupa was “certainly quite capable of accurately researching the existing case law about what constitutes the practice of law . . . in Hawai' i and in other jurisdictions, as 
well as any attorney,” but, nevertheless, despite that ability, and the Gould holding provided him by the Hawai' i Civil Rights 
Commission, Tagupa never sought advice of counsel from ODC or any other party concerning whether his activities were permitted as a suspended attorney. 
We conclude Respondent Tagupa’s conduct violated Rules 
3.4(e) and 5.5(a) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct by 
violating RSCH Rules 2.16(c) and 2.17(a) and the standing injunction against him imposed by this court on March 3, 2005, though we also note Respondent Tagupa did not gain financially from any of the assistance provided to his distant relative. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent William Tagupa is
 
suspended from the practice of law for a further two years. In
 light of Respondent Tagupa’s long-standing suspension, the
 instant suspension is effective upon entry of this order.
 Respondent Tagupa, therefore, may not apply for reinstatement
 until the passage of at least one year from the entry date of
 this order, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.17(b)(3).

 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Tagupa shall bear
 
the costs of the disciplinary proceedings, upon the timely
 
submission of a verified bill of costs by the Office of
 Disciplinary Counsel, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.3(c).
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Tagupa is hereby 
notified that any further misconduct that can be established as the unauthorized practice of law under either the Hawai
'i or 
foreign case law cited above may be grounds for a criminal contempt proceeding against him, pursuant to HRS §§ 710­1077(1)(c), 710-1077(1)(g), and 710-1077(3)(b) (Supp. 2008), as a knowing violation of a valid order of this court enjoining him from the practice of law. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 24, 2016.
