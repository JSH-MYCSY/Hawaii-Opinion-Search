OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Shane Mark (Petitioner)
 
applied for a writ of certiorari on August 27, 2009, to review
 
the judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed on
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
May 29, 2009, pursuant to its May 8, 2009 published opinion
 
(opinion)1
 affirming in its entirety the August 2, 2004 Judgment
in Cr. No. 03-1-0495 (
Mark I) filed by the first circuit court
 
(the court)2 
; and affirming the court’s August 2, 2004 Judgment
in Cr. No. 03-1-0496 (Mark II) with regard to the merits of the 
convictions but vacating the extended term sentences, and 
remanding Mark II to the court.  See State v. Mark, 120 Hawai 'i 
499, 210 P.3d 22 (App. 2009). We hold that (1) for Petitioner’s 
convictions of attempted assault in the second degree, Hawai 'i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 (1993) and 707-711 (1993) in Mark I, murder in the second degree, (HRS) § 707-701.5 (1993) and attempted assault in the first degree, HRS §§ 705-500 and 707-710 (1993) in Mark II, jury instruction No. 65 with regard to Mark I and Mark II relating to the defense of use of force in defense of others pursuant to HRS § 703-305 (1993) was erroneous, inasmuch as it improperly included elements relating to the defense of defense of self, HRS § 703-304 (1993 & Supp. 2003); however, 
(2)
 the error was harmless because there was no evidence in the
 
record to support a finding that, under the circumstances as a
 person would reasonably believe them to be, Petitioner was
 justified in using force in defense of others; (3) although there
 was concurrent representation of Petitioner and a hostile witness

and joined by Associate Judges Craig H. Nakamura and Katherine G. Leonard.

 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
by the Office of the Public Defender (OPD or the OPD) in a matter
 
unrelated to Petitioner’s trial, the concurrent representation
 ended and OPD withdrew as the witness’s counsel before an actual
 conflict arose and, thus, retrial is not necessary;
 (4) Petitioner’s argument that he was denied the right to a fair
 trial due to prejudicial publicity, jury taint, and prosecutorial
 misconduct is incorrect inasmuch the record contains no evidence
 to support such a conclusion; and (5) on remand the court may
 empanel a jury to consider whether Petitioner should be sentenced
 to an extended term either pursuant to the judicially amended
 version of the extended term sentencing statute or pursuant to
 Act 1 of the Second Special Session of the 2007 legislature. See
 
2007 Haw. Sess. L. (Second Special Session) Act 1 at 1.
 
I.
 
The following essential matters, some verbatim, are
 
from the record and the submissions of the parties. 
A.
 
In summary, with respect to Mark I, in January of 2003,
 
Petitioner purchased a camera from Kimo and John Piko (Piko). 
Petitioner then sold the camera to his friend, Russell Kimura
 (Kimura), who, a few days later, called Petitioner to tell him
 that the camera did not work. After informing Kimo that the
 camera was broken, Kimo agreed to return the money in exchange
 for the camera. On February 1, 2003, Petitioner, along with his
 pregnant girlfriend Leslie Martin (Martin), drove to a meeting at
 
3
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a parking lot in order to complete the exchange. Although
 
Petitioner had planned on meeting Kimo at the meeting, Piko and
 Denny Paikai (Paikai) arrived instead. Eventually, Kimura and
 his girlfriend Carle Enosara arrived with the camera. 
Conflicting testimony was adduced at trial as to what
 
happened next. The witnesses agreed, however, that a
 disagreement ensued regarding a box that contained the camera,
 initially held by Petitioner, which eventually ended up in Piko’s
 possession. Petitioner testified that at that point “he took out
 the gun, pointed it above Piko’s head and fired off a round into
 the air.” According to Petitioner, he “was standing by the car
 right next to [Martin]. She was sitting on the driver’s side. 
Paikai was moving to the front of the car by the headlights.” 
Petitioner “testified that he took the gun and reached over the
 car and fired a single shot into Paikai’s leg. [Petitioner] said
 he meant to shoot the leg and did not aim for the head or body.” 
B. 
In summary, with respect to Mark II, on March 4, 2003,
 
Petitioner, accompanied by Martin, went to a Baskin Robbins ice
 cream store in Kapolei to meet his ex-girlfriend Melissa Sennett
 (Sennett) and their daughter Shansy (Daughter). At the time,
 Petitioner was wanted by police in connection with Mark I. 
Operating on a tip from Sennett, police officers Glenn Gaspar
 (Officer Gaspar) and Calvin Sung (Officer Sung), both dressed in
 plain clothes, entered Baskin Robbins and attempted to arrest
 
4
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioner. While carrying out the arrest, a struggle ensued,
 
during which Petitioner fired three shots from his gun. Officer
 Gaspar died as a result of gunshot wounds from the struggle. 
C.

On March 6, 2003, two indictments were filed against
 
Petitioner. In the first indictment related to Mark I,

request, and they were tried [by] a jury in December 2003.” 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 507, 210 P.3d at 30. In regard to Mark I, 
Petitioner testified that after he arrived in the parking lot, he looked through the rear window of his car and saw Piko and Paikai approaching. Petitioner “thought they was going to do something to us” and he felt “[p]retty frightened . . . because their looks was intimidating and they was pretty big, and it’s just their attitudes.” At that point, Petitioner “grabbed the gun from the back seat and [] put it in [his] waist” “for protection, safety,” although Petitioner did not plan to use the gun. Petitioner said he was worried about safety “[b]ecause [Martin] was in the car and she was pregnant, and also my friend’s girlfriend was right there.” 
Petitioner testified that he was standing between the
 
cars while Piko and Paikai approached him from opposite
 directions. According to Petitioner, Piko “whack[ed]
 [Petitioner’s] car pretty hard with his one hand” and then
 “turned towards me and he told me we just going take the camera
 away from you, what you going do?” Petitioner then “gave [Piko]
 the camera and [] said, here, you can have it.” According to
 Petitioner, Piko then “smiled and he was about to put the camera
 down on the trunk, and he turned towards me and he said that we
 just going take everything from you.” Petitioner took this to
 mean that “we was being robbed[,]” and he felt “[p]retty scared”
 because “[t]he guys was going trap me between the two cars and
 
8
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
beat me up.” Petitioner stated that he was also afraid for
 
Martin and his unborn child because “[s]he would see these guys
 beating me up, and she would come out and try and stop them.” 
Petitioner then pulled out his gun intending to scare Piko and
 Paikai away. He “pointed it above [Piko’s] head and [] shot a
 round,” at which point Piko ran off. 
After Petitioner lost sight of Piko, he turned to look
 
for Paikai. Petitioner saw him “kneeling down, and he was coming
 around [Petitioner’s] car towards [Petitioner].” Petitioner
 “[f]elt like . . . [Paikai] might have a weapon or something[,]”
 and he “was real scared[.]” Petitioner “reached over the car,
 and when [Paikai] was about to turn the corner by the headlights
 by the front fender, [Petitioner] shot him in the leg.” 
Petitioner “mean[t] to shoot his leg” in order “to stop him.” 
As to Mark II, on direct examination, Petitioner
 
testified that he went to Baskin Robbins with Martin in order to
 meet Daughter, Sennett, and Sennett’s boyfriend,
14 later
 
identified as John Kortz (Kortz). Petitioner had a gun in his
 possession that he was carrying . . . with [him] everywhere.” 
Petitioner entered Baskin Robbins, and saw Daughter, Sennett, and
 Kortz. He went up to Daughter and patted her on the back. 
Petitioner stated that as he was standing behind Daughter, who
 was sitting on a chair, he “pulled out [a] necklace and was going
 
14
 Petitioner initially referred to Sennett’s boyfriend as “Scott,”
but later in his testimony referred to the same person as “John Kortz.”
“Scott” was John Kortz’s middle name, as well as his nickname. 
9
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to put it around her neck.” When asked if Petitioner was able to
 
“get the necklace on her neck[,]” Petitioner replied “no,” and
 stated that “[a]t that time, these two guys was trying to grab
 me.” 
According to Petitioner, he did not see the “two guys”
 
before they tried to grab him, and that he heard them say, “Put
 your hands up, put your hands up.” Once the men had grabbed
 Petitioner, he “responded” by “[t]r[ying] for get these guys off
 of me . . . [b]ecause I didn’t know who they was.” Petitioner
 stated that he “had a feeling that they was going to pull me out
 of the store” to “[t]ake me someplace and kill me.” Petitioner
 testified that in response to the efforts of the two men to “move
 me towards my daughter and out the door[,]” he “backed up” and
 “took them as far away from my daughter as I could.” Petitioner
 stated he was “[p]retty scared, because my daughter can get
 hurt.” During the struggle, a third man came up behind
 Petitioner and grabbed him in a “bear hug.” Petitioner then got
 his right hand free, and grabbed the gun “[t]o get these guys off
 of me.” Petitioner said, “I turned to one side like this, and
 then I shot him one time.” Petitioner then “shot two more
 times.” 
According to Petitioner, had he known that the men
 
grabbing him were police, he “would have stopped and listened to
 every command they told me . . . [b]ecause I would know that my
 daughter them would be safe.” Petitioner stated that he “first
 
10
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
learn[ed] that the people that had grabbed [him] were police
 
officers . . . [a]s they were picking [him] up and dragging [him]
 out of the store.” 
Officer Sung testified that he and Officer Gaspar
 
entered the store and “[one] hundred percent positively ID’d
 [Petitioner], and then we turned toward [Petitioner]” and lifted
 up their shirts to display their police badges. Officer Sung
 stated that Petitioner was “about eight to ten feet away” at the
 time. He stated that “then I see [Petitioner] reaching for
 something, and from my police training and experiences, usually
 when they reach for something in their pocket, usually it means
 weapon, so I’m telling [Petitioner] pull [sic] your hands up,
 police, and then I kept on approaching [Petitioner].” Officer
 Sung testified that Petitioner “was reaching toward his right
 pants pocket[,]” “and that’s the reason why I told him ‘Put up
 your hands, police.’” 
According to Officer Sung, “[Officer Gaspar] reache[d]
 
over, he was using his –- both of his hands, he grabbed. He’s
 using his left hand to grab [Petitioner’s] right wrist area, and
 he was using his right hand to grab his left hand area, and then
 I was trying to grab his elbow area to –- to restrain his right
 arm.” Officer Sung stated that he was grabbing for Petitioner’s
 right hand in order to stop Petitioner from “[r]eaching for any
 kind of weapons, possibly gun or possibly knife, possibly harming
 other people.” Officer Sung went on to describe the struggle,
 
11
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
stating that Petitioner “was trying to break free of us, our
 
restraint, and then he was reaching something into his pocket.” 
Petitioner was then able to get his hand free to grab
 
the gun, and Officer Sung saw it pointed at both him and Officer
 Gaspar. As the struggle continued, Officer Sung “heard two
 gunshots going off, like right after the other.” The group then
 fell to the ground, and, according to Officer Sung, Petitioner
 “tried to curl his arm, and then he was pointing the gun at me at
 the same time[.]” Officer Sung testified that Petitioner pointed
 the gun at him “at least two times.” Officer Sung next heard a
 third detective say that he had taken Petitioner’s gun, and then
 Officer Sung was able to handcuff Petitioner and place him under
 arrest. 
At that trial, the court gave jury instructions 
regarding “the defense of another person,” as well as self-defense, to Counts I-IV of Mark I and Counts I-III of Mark II. As pointed out by the ICA, “[t]he instructions were similar to each other, with some exceptions that are not relevant to this appeal.”
15 Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 522, 210 P.3d at 45. In his 
Application, Petitioner takes issue with Jury Instruction No. 65, relating to a defense to the charge of murder in the first degree (Count I in Mark II), which stated in part as follows: 
[1] In Count [I] of [Mark II], if you unanimously find
that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
15
 Petitioner did not disagree with this conclusion.
 
12
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
13all of the material elements of Murder in the First Degree,
or of the included offense of Murder in the Second Degree,
or of the included offense of Manslaughter based upon
reckless conduct, then you must consider whether the force
used by Defendant was justifiable based upon use of force in
defense of another person.
[2] Justifiable use of force or deadly force in
defense of another person is a defense to the offenses of
Murder in the First Degree, Murder in the Second Degree, and
Manslaughter based upon reckless conduct.  The burden is on
the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
force used by the Defendant was not justifiable based upon
use of force in defense of another person.  If you
unanimously find that the prosecution has not met its
burden, then you must find the Defendant not guilty as to
Count [I] of [Mark II].  If you are not unanimous as to
whether the prosecution has met its burden, then a verdict
cannot be returned as to Count [I] of [Mark II].
[3] The use of force upon or toward another person is
justified to protect a third person when:
1.  Under the circumstances as the Defendant
reasonably believed them to be, the third person would have
been justified in using such force to protect himself or
herself; and
2.  The Defendant reasonably believed that his
intervention was immediately necessary to protect the third
person.
[4] The reasonableness of the Defendant’s belief that
the use of such protective force was immediately necessary
shall be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable
person in the Defendant’s position under the circumstances
of which the Defendant was aware or as the Defendant
reasonably believed them to be.
[5] The third person would have been justified in
using force upon or toward [Officer Gaspar] if he or she
reasonably believed that such force was immediately
necessary to protect himself or herself on the present
occasion against the use of unlawful force by [Officer
Gaspar].
[6] The third person would have been justified in
using deadly force upon or toward [Officer Gaspar] if he or
she reasonably believed that deadly force was immediately
necessary to protect himself or herself on the present
occasion against death, serious bodily injury, or
kidnapping.
[7] The use of deadly force is not justifiable [(a)]
if the Defendant, with the intent of causing death or
serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force against
himself in the same encounter, or [(b)] if the Defendant
knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force
with complete safety by retreating. . . .
. . . . 
(Emphases added.)  Petitioner did not object to Jury Instruction
No. 65. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

On December 22, 2003, in regard to Mark I, the jury
 
returned the following verdict: Count I, no verdict on the
 
charge of attempted murder in the second degree of Piko; Count
 II, Petitioner guilty of the included offense of attempted
 assault in the second degree of Paikai; Count III, no verdict on
 the first of two charges of carrying, using or threatening to use
 a firearm in the commission of a separate felony, Count IV,
 Petitioner guilty on the second charge of carrying, using, or
 threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a separate
 felony. Also on December 22, the jury returned the following
 verdict in regard to Mark II: Count I, Petitioner guilty of
 murder in the second degree of Officer Gaspar; Count II, no
 verdict on the charge of attempted murder in the first degree of
 Officer Sung; Count III, Petitioner guilty of carrying, using or
 threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a separate
 felony. 
As to Counts I and III in Mark I and Count II in Mark
 
II, the court found “manifest necessity” and “set these cases for
 retrial[.]” As to the four counts of which Petitioner was found
 guilty, the court left “the sentencing date until after the
 retrial[.]” 
On March 31, 2004, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State 
of Hawai
'i (Respondent or the prosecution) filed motions for 
extended terms of imprisonment in Mark I and Mark II.

On July 7, 2004, Petitioner’s second trial began as to
 
Counts I and III in Mark I and Count II in Mark II. On July 14,
 2004, during the second trial, at a conference with the court out
 of the presence of the jury, Deputy Public Defender (DPD) Debra
 Loy (Loy), who was representing Petitioner, engaged in the
 following colloquy regarding the prosecution’s plan to put Piko
 on the stand:
 
[LOY]: Your Honor, we have also been informed that []
Piko is in custody; and rather than have a question about
prior bad acts, we need to find out what that is. I have
 not been able to find him in the records of the state
 custody people. And, so, I need an offer of proof what he’s
serving time for.
THE COURT: How long have you known that [] Piko was
in custody?
[LOY]: This morning I had it confirmed. I thought []
Paikai was in custody, and he denied it, and he told me Piko
 was.
 
THE COURT: Is [] Piko in custody?
[PROSECUTOR]: Well, Judge, I find it impossible to
believe that they don’t know that he’s in custody since
their office represented him in the last six months, in this
building, Jason Burks [(Burks)], Deputy Public Defender,
which I think raises serious ethical problems in that
office. But they did it; they know it.
[LOY]: And you knew it all this time?
[PROSECUTOR]: No, no.
[LOY]: We haven’t known it.
 
(Emphases added.) Loy argued that “[i]f [Piko is] on probation
 
and we’re still representing him, we have a mistrial problem, and
 we cannot cross-examine him.” However, the prosecutor argued
 that “[t]hey can cross-examine him on anything[.]” 
The discussion continued at length, with Loy explaining
 
that she felt there was an “ethical problem” related to
 representing Petitioner and Piko at the same time, and the
 
15
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prosecutor arguing that no such problem existed. Loy argued that
 
“[t]he issue is related to [Petitioner’s] right to have
 representation, full and fair representation by a person who has
 no loyalty to anyone else, Judge.” The colloquy then resumed:
 
THE COURT: . . . I do not know, I will not know until
I look at the case law on this duty to defend and duty of
loyalty and whether in a big office like the Public
Defender’s Office that [sic] can be divided.
[LOY]: Well, [] Burks works in the same section I do.
We probably share the same secretary. I have to confirm
 that.
 
THE COURT: Are you asking for a mistrial
?
 
[LOY]: I’m asking for a mistrial.
THE COURT: Okay. We’ll take it under advisement. 
We’re going to have to excuse the jury, though.

[PROSECUTOR]: And we’re objecting, Your Honor.
 
(Emphases added.) 
On July 20, 2004, Petitioner filed a Motion for
 
Mistrial and Motion to Withdraw as Counsel and to Appoint Other
 
Counsel (Petitioner’s Motion). Attached to Petitioner’s Motion
 was a “Declaration of Counsel,” in which Loy explained that
 (1) in November and December of 2003, she and [DPD] Teresa
 Marshall (Marshall) represented Petitioner during his first
 trial, (2) “[a]t that time, neither [Loy] nor Marshall was aware
 that [Piko] had been represented by the [OPD] in 2001 and 2002,
 for forgery and drug charge[s] in which Piko was sentenced to
 probation[,]” (3) “[i]n April of 2004, although then unknown by
 [Loy] and Marshall, the [OPD], through another [DPD], represented
 [Piko] in a Motion to Revoke Probation for the earlier [f]orgery
 offense[,]” (4) prior to July 14, 2004, when Loy sought an offer
 of proof from the prosecution regarding Piko, “[she] and Marshall
 were unaware . . . about the representation of [Piko,]”
 
16
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(5) “neither [Piko] nor [Petitioner] is willing to waive any
 
conflict of interest arising from their dual representation[,]”
 (6) “[i]n the current trial the defense is compelled to either
 cross-examine [Piko] or to call and question him as an adverse
 witness, using all available impeachment[,]” and “[Loy] would be
 duty bound to use the information from the prior conviction and
 any other impeachment she could find to adequately represent
 [Petitioner] and yet bound not to adversely impact Piko.” 
Loy declared that she had communicated with Charles
 
Hite (Hite) from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and that
 “Hite gave an ‘informal opinion’ that the [OPD] had a conflict of
 interest and must move for a mistrial and move to withdraw from
 representing [Petitioner].” Loy concluded that the OPD “has a
 conflict of interest which requires a mistrial and withdrawal
 from representation of [Petitioner].” 
In a Memorandum in Support of Petitioner’s Motion, 
Petitioner argued that (1) in representing Petitioner, Loy would be required to impeach Piko, which would be “‘directly adverse’ to [Piko’s] interest[,]” (2) the conflict of interest was not remedied by the fact that Petitioner and Piko were represented by different DPDs because under the Hawai
'i Rules of Professional 
Conduct (HRPC), the OPD was “more akin to a ‘law firm’ than a 
‘governmental agency’ under [HRPC] Rule 1.10[,]”16
 (3) [t]he
16
 HRPC Rule 1.10 states in relevant part: 
(continued...)
 
17
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[OPD] does not have in place any ‘screens’ or procedures to allow
 
separate representation without conflict[,]” (4) the DPDs
 representing Petitioner and Piko “have the same secretary, the
 same supervisor, and share investigators and messengers and
 receptionists[,]” and (5) “the [DPDs] of the [OPD] are totally
 integrated into one firm within the meaning of the [HRPC].” 
On July 20, 2004, the court held a hearing on
 
Petitioner’s Motion. At the hearing, Petitioner’s witness
 Timothy Ho (Ho), the Acting Chief Deputy Public Defender,
 testified on cross-examination that DPDs shared client
 information with one another because “it is as if we are one firm
 and we can freely share that information among other attorneys
 within that firm in order to help us prepare cases.” On July 21,
 2004, the court orally denied Petitioner’s Motion. Additionally,
 the court disqualified the OPD from further representing Piko. 
On August 16, 2004, the court issued its “Findings of
 
Fact [(findings)], Conclusions of Law [(conclusions)], and Order
 Denying [Petitioner’s] Consolidated Oral Motions for Mistrial and 
16(...continued)
(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of
them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them
practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules
1.7, 1.8(c), 1.9 or 2.2.
 
. . . .
 (c) A firm disqualification prescribed by this rule
may be waived by the affected client by consent after
consultation.
 
(d) The disqualifications of Rules 1.7, 1.9(a),
1.9(b), or 1.11(c)(1) shall not be imputed to government
lawyers provided the disqualified government lawyer has been
screened from participation in the matter.
 
18
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to Withdraw as Counsel.” In sum, the court found that
 
(1) “[n]either [] Burks nor the [OPD] have any matters pending
 with regard to Piko and the [OPD] has closed the file[,]”
 (2) “Loy had not learned of any secrets of Piko nor did she have
 knowledge of any confidential attorney-client communications had
 between Piko and [] Burks[,]” (3) “[Petitioner’s] trial does not
 involve either the same or any matter substantially related to
 the facts and circumstances regarding the case in which Piko was
 placed on probation[,]” and (4) “Loy’s ability to represent
 zealously the interests of [Petitioner] will not be affected by
 Piko’s status as former client of the [OPD].” 
The court determined that (1) “there is no basis to 
conclude that confidential attorney-client communications had between [] Burks and Piko will be communicated to either [] Loy or [] Marshall[,]” (2) “Piko’s status is that of a prior or former client for purposes of conflict analysis[,]” (3) “Piko’s status as a former or prior client makes State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 960 P.2d 1227 (1998), distinguishable from the 
situation in the instant matter[,]” (4) neither HRPC Rule 1.7 nor Rule 1.9 prevented the OPD from representing Petitioner, (5) the ability of Loy and Marshall to represent Petitioner would “not be materially limited due to [Burks’s] prior representation of Piko,” and (6) the OPD was immediately disqualified from representing Piko. 
19
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The OPD continued to represent Petitioner at the
 
resumption of his trial. On July 22, 2004, Loy called Piko as an
 
adverse witness. Piko admitted on direct examination that in the
 parking lot during the incident related to Mark I, he asked
 Petitioner, “[W]hat you going do if I take [the camera] from
 you[?]” 
2. 
On July 30, 2004, the jury returned a verdict on the
 
remaining counts in Mark I and Mark II. As to Mark I, the jury
 was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts. As to
 Mark II, the jury found Petitioner guilty of the included offense
 of attempted assault in the first degree of Officer Sung. On
 
August 2, 2004, the court held a sentencing hearing, during which
 
it dismissed Counts I and III in Mark I. 
As to the remaining counts in Mark I, the court denied
 
the prosecution’s motion for extended term of imprisonment. 
However, in regard to the remaining counts in Mark II, the court
 granted the prosecution’s motion for extended term of
 imprisonment, 
finding that [Petitioner] was a persistent and multiple
offender and that extended terms of imprisonment were
necessary for the protection of the public. Accordingly,
[the court] sentenced [Petitioner] to an extended term of
imprisonment of life without the possibility of parole for
Count I in Mark II, rather than the term of life with the
possibility of parole that would otherwise apply to a second
degree murder conviction. See HRS § 706-661 (Supp. 2003).
The court also imposed extended terms of imprisonment on the
other counts of conviction in Mark II.

F.
 
On appeal to the ICA, Petitioner argued nine different
 
grounds for reversing or vacating his convictions and sentences. 
Petitioner argued that the court
 
erred by (1) granting in part the Honolulu Police
Department's (HPD) motion to quash a subpoena for certain
Internal Affairs Division records; (2) admitting a slow
motion version of a videotape taken during the incident at
[] Baskin-Robbins and refusing [Petitioner’s] proposed jury
instructions on the videotape; (3) incorrectly instructing
the jury on the justification of defense of others in the
first and second trials; (4) referring the jury back to the
court's instructions in response to a communication during
deliberations in the first trial; (5) denying his motion for
mistrial and his counsel's motion to withdraw during the
second trial after it was discovered that the [OPD] had
represented Piko; and (6) denying his motion for a mistrial
after it was discovered during the second trial that Piko
believed that he had made a deal with [Respondent] in
exchange for his testimony in the first trial, and after a
juror received an anonymous voice mail which suggested that
the juror should “watch [her] back.” [Petitioner] further
argue[d] that [(7)] he was denied a fair trial and impartial
jury in the first trial based on factors including
prejudicial publicity and the prosecutor's questioning of
witnesses during trial, and that [(8)] there was
insufficient evidence to convict him of the attempted
assault in the first degree of Officer Sung in the second
trial. . . . [Petitioner] also argues that [(9)] the
extended term sentences in Mark II violated his
 
constitutional rights
.
 
Id. The ICA rejected Petitioner’s arguments with respect to his
 
convictions and affirmed the decision of the court. Id. Not all
 
of the arguments presented to the ICA were included in his
 
Application to this court. 
II.
 
Petitioner lists the following questions in his
 
Application: 
1) Did the [ICA] Err in Ruling That Any Error in the Jury
Instructions on Defense of Others Was Harmless Error? 
2) Did the [ICA] Err in Ruling That the Trial Court DidNot Err in Denying the Motion for Mistrial andWithdrawal of Counsel in the Second Trial? 
21
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3) Did the [ICA] Err in Ruling That [Petitioner] Was Not
Denied a Fair Trial?
 
4) Did the [ICA] Err in Not Remanding Mark II Only For
Non-Extended Sentencing?
 
In seeking to reverse or vacate his convictions, Petitioner has
 
the burden to demonstrate that the ICA gravely erred. See
 HRS
 
§ 602-59 (Supp. 2009).
 
Respondent filed a memorandum in opposition on
 
September 10, 2009. 
III.
 
A.
 
As to Petitioner’s first question, preliminarily, at 
Petitioner’s first trial, the court gave several jury instructions regarding the defense of others. In his Application, Petitioner states that in his Opening Brief he “argued plain error in all the court’s instructions on Defense of Others because they contained misleading and confusing language.” The ICA noted that “[t]he instructions were similar to each other, with some exceptions that are not relevant to this appeal.” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 522, 210 P.3d at 45. Petitioner 
does not take issue with this conclusion, and only identifies one jury instruction in his Application, Jury Instruction No. 65, in arguing that the court’s jury instructions on defense of others were erroneous. Thus, only Jury Instruction No. 65 in regard to Petitioner’s first trial is substantially examined. 
It does not appear that Petitioner directly challenges
 
any jury instructions related to his second trial. Petitioner’s 
22
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Application refers to the second trial only once in regard to 
jury instructions. He states that “[t]he prosecutor made the same argument at the second trial” as he did at the first trial “that it was [Petitioner] who provoked the use of force by reaching for his gun first.” However, Petitioner does not say what this argument had to do with any particular jury instruction given at his second trial. Additionally, Petitioner relates that “[t]he ICA found that ‘. . . there was no evidence establishing that [Petitioner] reasonably believed that Martin or Daughter would have been justified in using deadly force to protect themselves inside [] Baskin Robbins.’” (Quoting Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 528, 210 P.3d at 51. (Ellipsis in original.)) The 
ICA had reached this conclusion in regard to Petitioner’s second trial. Similar to his reference to the prosecutor’s argument, Petitioner does not explain why the ICA was incorrect in regard to any jury instructions given at his second trial. 
Assuming, arguendo, that in his Application Petitioner 
has properly challenged jury instructions on defense of others in his second trial, “only one of those instructions, which related to the first degree attempted murder charge for Officer Sung and the lesser included offenses of that charge, resulted in a conviction.” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 527, 210 P.3d at 50. That 
jury instruction is discussed further infra. 
23
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
1.
 
Petitioner argues that “[b]y omitting and mixing up
 
crucial elements of HRS [§] 703-304[ 17
] and [HRS § 703-305
relating to the defense of others], the jury instructions on
 defense of others were confusing, misleading, and prejudicial.” 
Relying on State v. Augustin, 101 Hawai
'i 127, 63 P.3d 1097 
(2002),18
 Petitioner asserts that “[u]nder HRS [§] 703-305, the
17 HRS § 703-304, related to the defense of self, provides in
relevant part as follows:
 
(2) The use of deadly force is justifiable under
this section if the actor believes that deadly force is
necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily
injury, kidnapping, rape, or forcible sodomy.
(3) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (4)
and (5) of this section, a person employing protective force
may estimate the necessity thereof under the circumstances
as he believes them to be when the force is used without
 retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act
which he has no legal duty to do, or abstaining from any
lawful action.
 
(4) The use of force is not justifiable under this
section:
 
(a)	 To resist an arrest which the actor knows is
 being made by a law enforcement officer,
although the arrest is unlawful; []
 
. . . .
 5) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under
this section if:
 
(a)	 The actor, with the intent of causing death or
serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force
against himself in the same encounter; or
 
(b)	 The actor knows that he can avoid the necessity
of using such force with complete safety by
retreating or by surrendering possession of a
thing to a person asserting a claim of right
thereto or by complying with a demand that he
abstain from any action which he has no duty to
take[.]
 
(Emphases added.)
 
18
 Augustin provides no support for Petitioner’s position. In that 
case, this court analyzed a jury instruction that, like the jury instructionat issue here, was based on Hawai' i Pattern Jury Instructions-- Criminal
(HAWJIC) No. 7.02 on defense of others. Petitioner argues that “[e]ven in
(continued...)
 
24
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
jury is supposed to look at the circumstances as the defendant
 
believed them to be, not the third party.” Petitioner takes
 issue with paragraphs 5 and 6 of Jury Instruction No. 65,
19
 
asserting that paragraphs 5 and 6 “told the jury that even if the
 actor had a reasonably mistaken belief, it did not matter if the
 third party himself or herself could not reasonably believe that
 force was immediately necessary to protect himself or herself.” 
2.
 
Respondent does not argue that the court’s jury
 
instructions were not erroneous. Instead, Respondent argues that
 
18(...continued)
Augustin, [this court] recognized that the actor could have a reasonable but
mistaken belief.” In Augustin, the defendant challenged a different part ofthe jury instruction, which “advis[ed] the jury to consider [the defendant’s]justification claims ‘from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in [thedefendant’s] position under the circumstances of which [the defendant] wasaware or as [the defendant] reasonably believed them to be[.]’” 101 Hawai' i 
at 127, 63 P.3d at 1097 (emphasis added). A majority of this court upheldthat statement, because it would be “error to judge the reasonableness of adefendant's viewpoint based on circumstances ‘shown in the evidence’ but ofwhich the defendant is not ‘aware.’” Id. 
In this case, Jury Instruction No. 65 contained language identical to
that challenged above in Augustin. Paragraph 4 stated that “[t]he
reasonableness of the Defendant’s belief that the use of such protective force
was immediately necessary shall be determined from the viewpoint of a
reasonable person in the Defendant’s position under the circumstances of which
the Defendant was aware or as the Defendant reasonably believed them to be.” 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, as in Augustin, paragraph 4 indicated to the jury
that Petitioner “could have a reasonable but mistaken belief.” 
19 As noted above, paragraphs 5 and 6 stated as follows:
 
[5] The third person would have been justified in
using force upon or toward [Officer Gaspar] if he or she
reasonably believed that such force was immediately
necessary to protect himself or herself on the present
occasion against the use of unlawful force by [Officer
Gaspar].
[6] The third person would have been justified in
using deadly force upon or toward [Officer Gaspar] if he or
she reasonably believed that deadly force was immediately
necessary to protect himself or herself on the present
occasion against death, serious bodily injury, or
kidnapping.
 
25
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“there is no ‘reasonable possibility that the error contributed
 
to [Petitioner’s] conviction[s]’ for the murder of Officer Gaspar
 (first trial), the assault of Officer Sung (second trial), or the
 assault of Paikai (first trial)[.]” 
3.
 
20
The ICA held that paragraph 3  of Jury Instruction No.
65 “makes clear that the jury must evaluate the issue ‘[u]nder the circumstances as the Defendant reasonably believed them to be,’ and paragraph 4 . . . further discusses how to assess the reasonableness of the defendant's belief.” 
Mark
, 120 Hawai 'i at 
524, 210 P.3d at 47. According to the ICA, “[v]iewed in the context of the entire instruction, paragraphs 5 and 6 did not improperly suggest that the jury should decide whether the third party was in fact justified in using force or deadly force.” Id. 
(footnote omitted). Instead, the ICA concluded that “they provided the jury with the underlying principles to evaluate the reasonableness of the defendant's belief that the third party would be so justified.” Id. Thus, the ICA held that 
Petitioner’s argument as to the jury instructions regarding the defense of others was “without merit.” Id. 
C.
 1.
 
This court has stated that “‘[w]hen jury instructions
 
or the omission thereof are at issue on appeal, the standard of
 
20
 See discussion infra.
 
26
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
review is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the 
instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading[.]’” State v. Gomes, 93 Hawai
'i 13, 
18, 995 P.2d 314, 319 (2000) (quoting State v. Kinnane, 79 Hawai
'i 46, 49, 897 P.2d 973, 976 (1995)). In this connection, 
“[e]rroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial.” State v. 
Aganon, 97 Hawai
'i 299, 302, 36 P.3d 1269, 1272 (2001) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). However, “jury instructions to which no objection has been made at trial will be reviewed only for plain error.” State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai
'i 325, 
330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998) (citing State v. Pinero, 75 Haw. 282, 292, 859 P.2d 1369, 1374 (1993)). In this case, Petitioner did not object to the jury instructions he challenges on appeal, and thus, the jury instructions are reviewed for plain error. 
2.
 
As pointed out by the ICA, Jury Instruction No. 65 was 
substantively identical to Hawai
'i Pattern Jury Instructions-­
Criminal (HAWJIC) No. 7.02 on defense of others. However, appellate courts are not bound by pattern jury instructions. State v. Nupeiset, 90 Hawai
'i 175, 182 n.9, 977 P.2d 183, 190 n.9 
(App. 1999). In order to determine whether Jury Instruction No. 65 was erroneous, it “must be examined in the context of the 
27
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
justification defenses[ 21
] of the use of force in the defense of
others and the use of force in the defense of oneself.” Id.
 at
 
179-80, 977 P.2d at 187-88 (footnote altered). The justification
 
defense of the “[u]se of force for the protection of other
 persons” is codified in HRS § 703-305, which provides in relevant
 part as follows:
 
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and of
section 703-310,[ 22
] the use of force upon or toward the
person of another is justifiable to protect a third person
when: 
(a) Under the circumstances as the actor believes 
them to be, the person whom the actor seeks toprotect would be justified in using suchprotective force; and
(b) The actor believes that the actor's intervention is necessary for the protection of the other person.
(2)Notwithstanding subsection (1):
(a) When the actor would be obliged under section703-304 to retreat, to surrender the possessionof a thing, or to comply with a demand beforeusing force in self-protection, the actor is notobliged to do so before using force for theprotection of another person, unless the actorknows that the actor can thereby secure thecomplete safety of such other person; and
(b) When the person whom the actor seeks to protectwould be obliged under section 703-304 toretreat, to surrender the possession of a thingor to comply with a demand if the person knewthat the person could obtain complete safety byso doing, the actor is obliged to try to causethe person to do so before using force in theperson's protection if the actor knows that theactor can obtain the other's complete safety inthat way[.] 
(Emphases added.)
 
21
 Nupeiset pointed out that “HRS § 703-301(1) (1993) provides, ‘In 
any prosecution for an offense, justification, as defined in sections 703-302through 703-309, is a defense.’” 90 Hawai' i at 180 n.3, 977 P.2d at 188 n.3. 
22
 The parties have not argued that HRS § 703-310, which limits the
defense of others where the defendant has a reckless or negligent belief or
engages in reckless or negligent conduct, is at issue in this case.
 
28
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The commentary to HRS § 703-305 states that this
 
section “permits a person to use force to protect another person
 
when the actor believes the other person would have been
 justified in using force to protect himself and he believes that
 his intervention is necessary to protect the other person.”
23
 
(Emphasis added.) In the context of the use-of-force defenses,
 “‘[b]elieves’ means reasonably believes[.]” HRS § 703-300
 (1993). In order for “the other person [to] have been justified
 in using force to protect himself,” the following requirements
 set forth in HRS § 703-304 regarding self-protection would apply:
 
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and of
section 703-308,[ 24
] the use of force upon or toward another
person is justifiable when the actor believes that such
force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting
himself against the use of unlawful force by the other
person on the present occasion.
(2) 
The use of deadly force is justifiable under this
section if the actor believes that deadly force is necessary
to protect himself against death, serious bodily injury,
kidnapping, rape, or forcible sodomy.
 
(Emphases added.) Thus, under HRS § 703-305, in order to use
 
force to protect a third person, the actor must have a reasonable
 belief that, as to the third person, (1) “force is immediately
 necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use
 of unlawful force by the other person on the present occasion,”
 
23
 Additionally, the commentary to HRS § 703-305 states that “[t]his
formulation covers situations in which the other's infirmity, infancy, or
other physical condition makes him especially unable to protect himself or
susceptible to injury, even though the actor, in a similar predicament, might
not himself have been justified in using force.” (Emphasis added.)
 
24
 HRS § 703-308, which justifies the use of force upon another
person if the force is enough to prevent, inter alia, suicide or the
commission of a crime, is not relevant to this case. 
29
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
or (2) “deadly force is necessary to protect himself against
 
death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, rape, or forcible
 sodomy.”
 
This conclusion is supported by the Model Penal Code 
and Commentaries (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1985) [hereinafter MPC] § 3.05. It has been observed that “HRS § 703-305 is nearly identical to [the MPC].” Nupeiset, 90 
Hawai
'i at 180, 977 P.2d at 188. The commentary to the MPC 
states in pertinent part that 
given the circumstances as the actor believes them to be,
the third person must legally be justified in using such
protective force. Thus, if the third person were resisting
an arrest by a known police officer, or if he were
attempting to effect an arrest with excessive force, he
would have no defense, and, if the circumstances were known
 
to the actor, the actor would have no defense either. 
MPC § 3.05 cmt. 1 at 64 (emphases added). In other words, if the
 
actor knew that the third person could not reasonably believe
 that the use of force was justified, the actor could not use
 force in the protection of the third person. 
D.
 
As stated before, Petitioner argued that paragraphs 5
 
and 6 “told the jury that even if the actor had a reasonably
 mistaken belief, it did not matter if the third party himself or
 herself could not reasonably believe that force was immediately
 necessary to protect himself or herself.” Petitioner appears to
 argue, as he did in his Opening Brief, that “the jury should not
 be deciding whether the third person had the right to defend 
30
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[himself]. The focus should have been on whether the defendant
 
reasonably believed [he or she] had that right.” 
Paragraph 5, related to the use of force, and paragraph
 
6, related to the use of deadly force, did address the reasonable
 belief of the third person, rather than the defendant. However,
 these paragraphs must be read in conjunction with paragraph 3 of
 Jury Instruction No. 65.
25 Paragraph 3 stated that “[t]he use of
 
force upon or toward another person is justified to protect a
 third person when . . . [u]nder the circumstances as the
 Defendant reasonably believed them to be, the third person would
 have been justified in using such force to protect himself or
 herself[.]” (Emphasis added.) Paragraph 3 makes clear that the
 focus of the jury should be upon “the circumstances as the
 Defendant reasonably believed them to be[.]” Viewing paragraphs
 5 and 6 in the context of paragraph 3, Jury Instruction No. 65
 correctly stated that the defendant must have reasonably believed
 that the third person was justified in believing that “force was
 immediately necessary to protect himself or herself” or “that
 deadly force was immediately necessary to protect himself or
 herself[.]” Thus, paragraphs 5 and 6, taken in conjunction with
 
25
 The court instructed the jury to view the instructions as a whole,
stating that, 
[y]ou must consider all of the instructions as a whole and
consider each instruction in light of all of the others. Do
 not single out any word, phrase, sentence or instruction and
ignore the others. Do not give greater emphasis to any
word, phrase, sentence or instruction simply because it is
repeated in these instructions.
 
31
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
paragraph 3 of Jury Instruction No. 65, was not an incorrect
 
statement of the law.
 
IV.
 
A.
 1.
 
Petitioner also argues that paragraph 7 of Jury
 
Instruction No. 65 was erroneous, apparently for two reasons. 
First, Petitioner claims that (1) “[b]y repeatedly using the word
 ‘Defendant,’ the focus is on the defendant, not the third
 party[,]” and (2) “[t]he jury might have thought [Petitioner]
 could have either retreated or used non-deadly force[,]” but “the
 circumstances would be different if he were also looking out for
 his pregnant girlfriend or his young daughter who was sick with
 the flu.” Second, Petitioner argues that (1) because “[t]he
 prosecution essentially argued that it was [Petitioner] who
 provoked the use of force by reaching for his gun first[, t]he
 court’s confusing instruction would have led the jury to
 incorrectly conclude that this prohibited [Petitioner’s] Defense
 of Others defense[,]” and (2) “[b]ased on what had happened
 before [with Piko and Paikai], [Petitioner] had every reason to
 believe that [Daughter] or [Martin] would get seriously injured
 or kidnapped.” 
2.
 
As to paragraph 7 of Jury Instruction No. 65, the ICA
 
in effect divided the paragraph into two parts and analyzed each
 
32
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
part separately. As to “the first part of paragraph 7 of the 
instruction, [(clause (a))] which provided that the use of deadly force is not justified ‘if the Defendant, with the intent of causing death or serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force against himself in the same encounter[,]’” the ICA “agree[d] with [Petitioner] that this part of the instruction does appear to mix principles of self-defense with those of defense of others in a way that could be confusing to a jury.” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 
527, 210 P.3d at 50 (emphasis added). However, the ICA held that the error was harmless because “[t]here [was] nothing in the record to suggest that [Petitioner], with the intent of causing death or serious bodily injury, did anything in [regard to Mark I or Mark II] to provoke the use of force against himself.” Id. 
The ICA concluded that “[t]his forecloses the possibility that the jury would have denied the defense of others justification to [Petitioner] based on the erroneous part of the instruction.” Id. 
In regard to the second part of paragraph 7, (clause
 
(b)), the ICA held that it was not erroneous because,
 
[r]ead in context of the entire instruction, the “necessity”
for using force in paragraph 7 refers to the threat to the
third party, and the instruction thus advises the jury that
the defendant must retreat only if he or she can avoid “the
necessity of such force with complete safety” of that third
party.
 
Id. at 526, 210 P.3d at 49 (emphasis added). The ICA also
 
concluded that even if clause (b) were erroneous, the error would
 be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because (1) in regard to
 
33
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Mark I, (a) there was no evidence to “support a reasonable belief
 
on [Petitioner’s] part that Martin was justified in using deadly
 force against Piko, let alone Paikai[,]” and (b) “the jury was
 also instructed on self-defense with regard to the counts at
 issue here, and necessarily rejected that defense in finding
 [Petitioner] guilty[,]” and, therefore, “it is not reasonably
 possible that a jury would find that [Petitioner] lacked
 justification to use deadly force to protect himself, but would
 find that he was justified in using it to protect . . .
 Martin[,]” and (2) in regard to Mark II, (a) “th[e] evidence
 foreclosed the possibility that [Petitioner] could have retreated
 in any event[,]” (b) “the jury was also instructed on
 self-defense with regard to the counts at issue here, and
 necessarily rejected that defense in finding [Petitioner]
 guilty[,]” and, therefore, “it is not reasonably possible that a
 jury would find that [Petitioner] lacked justification to use
 deadly force to protect himself, but would find that he was
 justified in using it to protect Daughter and Martin[,]”
 (c) defense counsel conceded that the use of deadly force by
 Daughter at Baskin-Robbins would have been excessive, and
 (d) Petitioner could not “have reasonably believed that there was
 a threat to Martin at [] Baskin-Robbins that would have justified
 the use of deadly force by her.” Id. at 526-27, 210 P.3d at 49­
50 (emphases added).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
To reiterate, paragraph 7 of Jury Instruction No. 65
 
stated that 
[t]he use of deadly force is not justifiable [(a)] if the
Defendant, with the intent of causing death or serious
bodily injury, provoked the use of force against himself in
the same encounter, or [(b)] if the Defendant knows that he
can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete
safety by retreating.
 
(Emphases added.) Paragraph 7 is identical to language contained 
in HAWJIC 7.02, which sets forth the pattern jury instruction of defense-of-others. The commentary to HAWJIC 7.02 does not indicate why such language is included in the instruction. However, as noted above, “[t]he instructions . . . are not binding on the Hawai
'i appellate courts.” Nupeiset, 90 Hawai 'i at 
182, 977 P.2d at 190 (citation omitted). 
In this case, contrary to the ICA’s conclusion that 
“the ‘necessity’ for using force in paragraph 7 refers to the threat to the third party,” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 526, 210 P.3d at 
49, the plain language of paragraph 7 is substantively identical to HRS § 703-304(5), dealing with self-protection. That HRS section states in relevant part that 
[t]he use of deadly force is not justifiable under this
section if . . . [t]he actor, with the intent of causing
death or serious bodily injury, provoked the use of force
against himself in the same encounter; or . . . [t]he actor
knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force
with complete safety by retreating[.] 
Additionally, as to clause (a) of paragraph 7, nothing in HRS
 
§ 703-305 relating to the protection of other persons involves
 the concept of provocation on the part of the defendant. Thus,
 
35
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
contrary to the ICA’s “necessity” reasoning, clause (a) is a
 
clearly erroneous statement of the law. 
As to clause (b), the manner in which HRS § 703-305
 
relating to defense of others deals with retreat is fundamentally
 different from the language set forth in clause (b) of paragraph
 7. HRS § 703-305(2)(a) states that “[w]hen the actor would be
 
26
obliged under section 703-304 to retreat ,[ ] . . . the actor is
not obliged to do so before using force for the protection of
 
another person, unless the actor knows that the actor can thereby
 
secure the complete safety of such other person[.]” 
(Emphases
 
added.) On the other hand, HRS § 703-305(2)(b) deals with the
 
obligation of the actor if the third person is obliged to
 
retreat: 
When the person whom the actor seeks to protect would be
obliged under section 703-304 to retreat, . . . if the
person knew that the person could obtain complete safety by
so doing, the actor is obliged to try to cause the person to
do so before using force in the person's protection if the
actor knows that the actor can obtain the other's complete
safety in that way[.]
 
(Emphasis added.) As noted before, the language of clause (b) of
 
paragraph 7 relates to self-protection and, thus, only addresses
 retreat in the context of self-protection. Thus, clause (b) of
 paragraph 7 conflicts with the retreat provision relating to
 defense of others in HRS § 703-305. Accordingly, clause (b) of
 
26
 Under HRS § 703-304(5)(b) related to self-protection, the actor
 
would be obliged to retreat if “[t]he actor knows that he can avoid the
necessity of using [deadly force] with complete safety by retreating or by
surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right
thereto or by complying with a demand that he abstain from any action[.]” 
36
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
paragraph 7 was also erroneous.
 
As said before, there is no explanation in the
 
commentary to HAWJIC 7.02 as to why the language in paragraph 7
 
should be included in an instruction on the justification of
 defense of others. Paragraph 7 obviously relates to the
 justification of self-defense, and thus would appear to have no
 place in an instruction related to the defense of others. HRS
 § 703-305 says nothing about provocation, and the concept of
 retreat set forth in HRS § 703-305(2) is entirely different from
 the concept of retreat as discussed in clause (b) of paragraph 7.
 
The ICA, despite concluding that clause (a) of 
paragraph 7 “appear[ed] to mix principles of self-defense with those of defense of others in a way that would be confusing to a jury,” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 527, 210 P.3d at 50, did not address 
the inclusion of paragraph 7 in the HAWJIC. Moreover, the ICA concluded that clause (b) of paragraph 7 was not erroneous, because it “referred to the threat to the third party, and the instruction advises the jury that the defendant must retreat only if he or she can avoid ‘the necessity of such force with complete safety’ of that third party.” Id. at 526, 210 P.3d at 49. 
Inasmuch as paragraph 7 is erroneous, the ICA’s decision is incorrect. Thus, contrary to the ICA’s decision, we hold that the language in paragraph 7 should not be included in HAWJIC 7.02. 
37
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
C.
 
Because the giving of paragraph 7 rendered Jury 
Instruction No. 65 erroneous, it must be determined whether such 
error was harmless. See Nupeiset, 90 Hawai 'i at 184, 977 P.2d at 
192 (stating that while the challenged jury instruction was “an incomplete statement of the law, we believe any error in giving it was harmless”). Preliminarily, as noted above, the ICA held that “[e]ven if we were to find that [paragraph 7] was a potentially misleading statement of the law, the error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt” because 
the jury was also instructed on self-defense with regard to
the counts at issue here, and necessarily rejected that
defense in finding [Petitioner] guilty [of the attempted
assault of Paikai and the second degree murder of Officer
Gaspar]. Given the evidence at trial, it is not reasonably
possible that a jury would find that [Petitioner] lacked
justification to use deadly force to protect himself, but
would find that he was justified in using it to protect
Daughter and Martin (at [] Baskin-Robbins) or Martin (at the
church parking lot).
 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 526, 210 P.3d at 49 (emphases added). 
However, as Petitioner stated, “‘[a]n intervenor’s
 
right to react is not strictly coterminous with a participant’s
 
right to self-defense.’” (Quoting Alexander v. State, 447 A.2d
 880, 887 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1982).) This statement is supported
 by the commentary to HRS § 703-305, which, as noted supra at note
 23, states that “[t]his formulation covers situations in which
 the other’s infirmity, infancy, or other physical condition makes
 him especially unable to protect himself or susceptible to
 injury, even though the actor, in a similar predicament, might
 not himself have been justified in using force.” (Emphasis
 
38
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
added.) As the commentary makes evident, it is possible that a
 
defendant could be justified in using force to protect another
 person, even if the defendant himself or herself was not
 justified in using force for self protection. Therefore,
 contrary to the ICA’s conclusion, it does not follow that a
 jury’s rejection of a defendant’s defense of self-defense, as in
 this case, would necessarily result in its rejection of a defense
 of defense of others, and, accordingly, the ICA also erred in
 this aspect of its reasoning.
 
D.
 1.
 
In regard to clause (a) of paragraph 7 as it relates to
 
provocation, the following evidence with respect to Mark I was
 adduced at Petitioner’s first trial.
27 As discussed supra,
 
Petitioner testified that he was being approached from opposite
 sides by Piko and Paikai, when Piko “whacked” Petitioner’s car
 with his hand. Piko then turned to Petitioner and asked
 Petitioner what he would do if Piko and Paikai took the camera
 from him. After giving the camera to Piko, Piko turned to
 Petitioner and stated that he and Paikai were “just going to take
 everything,” which Petitioner took to mean that he and Martin
 were being robbed. Petitioner thought Piko and Paikai were going
 to “trap [him] . . . and beat [him] up.” 
27
 Petitioner does not point to any difference in the evidence
adduced at his first and second trials related to the provocation of force on
his part.
 
39
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Paikai testified that while Petitioner and Piko were
 
having a conversation, “the discussion got heated, and I guess
 
the discussion was over where the property was going to go at the
 time.” Paikai stated that next, “[a]ll I seen was [Petitioner]
 give him the box and pull a gun.” According to Paikai, he saw
 Petitioner making “gestures” “like just before a fight is about
 to start[.]” He saw Piko “raising [his] hands out with [his]
 palms open,” as if Piko was saying “what or something.” Paikai
 related that Petitioner pulled the handgun and pointed it
 “[r]ight at [Piko’s] head” “[a]s soon as he put [the box] in
 [Piko’s] hand.” Paikai saw Piko “lift[] up the box[,]” at which
 point Petitioner “[f]ired a round[.]” Piko then turned and ran,
 while Petitioner “pull[ed] off maybe one or two more rounds[.]” 
Paikai stated that after Piko ran away, “[Petitioner]
 
turned his sights on [Paikai].” Paikai stated that Petitioner
 aimed the gun at him, “and I ran closer to [Petitioner’s] car,
 you know, making it a little harder for him to shoot me. And I
 think he pulled off two more shots, and then that’s when I got
 one in the leg[.]” 
Piko gave the following testimony about what happened
 
between him and Petitioner during the exchange of the box:
 
[Petitioner] started explaining to me about something, so I
told him what if I just take this from you, what you goin’
do? . . . That’s when he told me, you know what, here. He
 went hand the camera to me, and when I went grab ‘em, he
just went pull out his gun. 
(Emphasis added.) According to Piko, “[a]fter that, all I heard
 
40
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was pah, and I just – I was gone.” Piko testified that he did
 
not “touch [Petitioner] that night” or “verbally threaten him
 with words[.]” He stated that he did not “do anything to
 physically threaten [Petitioner],” and that the discussion he was
 having with Petitioner “wasn’t even [an] argument.” 
2.
 
HRS § 703-300 defines “force” as “any bodily impact,
 
restraint, or confinement, or the threat thereof.” (Emphasis
 added.) As to Mark I, based on Petitioner’s testimony discussed
 above, it would appear that he felt threatened by force from Piko
 and Paikai. However, nothing in Petitioner’s testimony indicates
 that he provoked such a threat. To “provoke” means “to incite to
 anger” or “to bring about deliberately[.]” Webster’s Third New
 
Int’l Dictionary 1827 (1961). Petitioner’s testimony indicates
 that in speaking to Piko and giving him the box, Petitioner did
 not provoke the threat of the use of force against himself. 
Thus, had the jury believed Petitioner’s testimony, the effect of
 clause (a) of paragraph 7 would have been harmless, because no
 provocation occurred on Petitioner’s part to invite the threat of
 force. If the jury believed Petitioner’s testimony, the
 limitation in clause (a) of paragraph 7 would have been harmless
 error, because Petitioner’s testimony did not support a finding
 that he had provoked the threat of force.
 
As to Paikai’s testimony, nothing in his testimony
 
indicated that he used force or the threat of force against
 
41
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioner in Mark I. Paikai did not testify that he heard the
 
actual conversation between Petitioner and Piko, but only that it
 appeared to get “heated.” Piko testified that he “told
 [Petitioner, W]hat if I just take this from you, what you goin'
 do?” 
Piko’s foregoing statement could be interpreted as the
 
threat of force, but neither Piko nor Paikai testified that such
 
force was provoked by Petitioner. Instead, Piko testified that
 
“[Petitioner] started explaining to me about something,” at which
 point he asked Petitioner what Petitioner would do if Piko took
 the box from him. The fact that Petitioner was “explaining . . .
 something” cannot be interpreted as provoking force by Piko or
 Paikai. Similarly, Paikai’s testimony that Petitioner was making
 “gestures” is not an indication that Petitioner provoked the use
 of force by Piko or Paikai. Thus, had the jury believed Piko’s
 and Paikai’s testimony, the error in clause (a) of paragraph 7
 relating to the provocation of Petitioner would have been
 harmless, because their testimony did not support a finding that
 Petitioner had provoked the use of force.
 
3.
 
Turning to clause (b) of paragraph 7, that clause
 
stated that “[t]he use of deadly force is not justifiable . . .
 if the Defendant knows that he can avoid the necessity of using
 such force with complete safety by retreating.” (Emphasis
 added.) As noted before, the language in this clause pertains
 
42
  
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
only to self protection. HRS § 703-300 defines “deadly force” as
 
follows:
 
“Deadly force” means force which the actor uses with the
intent of causing or which the actor knows to create a
substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.
Intentionally firing a firearm in the direction of another
person or in the direction which another person is believed
to be constitutes deadly force. A threat to cause death or
 serious bodily injury, by the production of a weapon or
otherwise, so long as the actor's intent is limited to
creating an apprehension that the actor will use deadly
force if necessary, does not constitute deadly force.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
It is undisputed that Petitioner “[i]ntentionally
 
fir[ed] a firearm in the direction of another person,” id.,
 
namely Piko and Paikai, and thus used deadly force, twice in the
 
Mark I incident. As to the use of deadly force in regard to
 
Piko, however, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Thus,
 
Petitioner’s use of deadly force and Petitioner’s duty to retreat
 
in regard to Piko is not further discussed.28
 
In regard to Paikai, it does not appear that any
 
witness testified directly as to whether Petitioner could have
 retreated, and thus avoid the necessity of using deadly force
 with complete safety. Petitioner stated that after Piko had run
 off, he turned to look for Paikai, and saw him kneeling down at
 the front of Petitioner’s car. Petitioner stated that he “[f]elt
 like . . . [Paikai] might have a weapon or something[,]” and he 
28
 As noted supra, the charges related to Piko were ultimately
 
dismissed after the jury was again unable to reach a verdict on them in the
second trial. 
43
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“was real scared[.]” Petitioner then reached over the car and
 
shot Paikai in the leg in order to “stop him.”
 
Nothing in this testimony indicates that Petitioner
 
knew that he could avoid the necessity of using deadly force by
 retreating. According to Petitioner, he saw Paikai “kneeling
 down, and . . . coming around [Petitioner’s] car towards
 [Petitioner].” Petitioner thought Paikai might have a weapon,
 and stated that he shot Paikai to “stop him.” The fact that
 Petitioner felt that he had to “stop” Paikai indicates that
 
Petitioner did not believe that he could have retreated with
 
complete safety. Petitioner did not testify as to any knowledge
 
he may have had in regard to avoiding the necessity of using
 force. Thus, there was no evidence adduced at trial that, as
 stated in clause (b), Petitioner knew he could have retreated
 with complete safety, thereby “avoid[ing] the necessity of using
 such force[.]” HRS § 703-304(5)(b). As a result, clause (b) as
 it relates to Mark I could not be applied and, hence, was also
 harmless error. 
E.
 1.
 
In regard to clause (a) of paragraph 7 of Instruction
 
No. 65 as it relates to Mark II, as discussed supra, Petitioner
 testified that he did not see Officer Gaspar or Officer Sung
 before they grabbed him, and thus, nothing in Petitioner’s
 testimony would indicate that he provoked the use of force
 
44
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
against himself. However, as noted before, Officer Sung
 
testified that after showing Petitioner his badge, he saw
 Petitioner “reaching for something, and from my police training
 and experiences, usually when they reach for something in their
 pocket, usually it means weapon, so I’m telling him pull your
 hands up, police, and then I kept on approaching [Petitioner].” 
Officer Sung stated that he grabbed for Petitioner’s right hand
 in order to stop Petitioner from “[r]eaching for any kind of
 weapons, possibly gun or possibly knife, possibly harming other
 people.” 
This testimony thus contradicts the ICA’s conclusion 
that “[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest that [Petitioner], with the intent of causing death or serious bodily injury, did anything in [] Baskin-Robbins to provoke the use of force against himself.” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 527, 210 P.3d at 50 
(emphasis added). Officer Sung testified that Petitioner reached for his pocket, which, in Officer Sung’s experience, usually meant that the person was reaching for a weapon. Officer Sung testified that he grabbed for Petitioner’s hand, i.e., used force on Petitioner, in order to prevent Petitioner from reaching for a weapon. Since weapons are generally used for the purpose of causing death or serious bodily injury, Officer Sung’s testimony is evidence that Petitioner provoked the use of force against himself. 
45
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Because clause (a) of paragraph 7 stated that the
 
protection of other persons defense was unavailable to Petitioner
 
if he provoked the use of force, clause (a) as it related to Mark
 II was potentially harmful. Based on the evidence, the jury
 could have believed, following the direction in clause (a) of
 paragraph 7, that Petitioner provoked the use of force against
 himself, thus disqualifying him from claiming the defense of
 others defense. Inasmuch as paragraph 7, clause (a), of Jury
 Instruction No. 65 was erroneous, the jury could have reached a
 decision that was legally infirm. 
2.
 
As to clause (b) of paragraph 7, it is clear from the
 
testimony of all the witnesses that Petitioner did not know he
 could have retreated with complete safety in Baskin Robbins. To
 retreat means “to draw back” or “withdraw.” Webster’s Third New
 
Int’l Dictionary at 1940. But prior to Petitioner’s use of
 force, he was engaged in a struggle with the officers, who,
 according to Officer Sung, “grabb[ed]” and “restrain[ed]”
 Petitioner. Petitioner testified that the men were “grabbing”
 him, and “holding onto [him],” and that while the first two men
 were grabbing him, a third man came up behind Petitioner and
 grabbed him in a “bear hug.” This testimony indicates that
 Petitioner could not have retreated at all, i.e., “withdrawn,”
 because he was being “restrain[ed]” by the officers at the time. 
46
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Clause (b) of paragraph 7 instructed the jury that if 
Petitioner knew that he could have retreated with complete 
safety, the defense of others defense was unavailable to him. However, as discussed above, there was no evidence adduced at trial that Petitioner knew he could have retreated with complete safety, thereby “avoid[ing] the necessity of using such force[.]” In fact, the evidence indicated that Petitioner was unable to retreat because he was being held by the officers. Inasmuch as there was no evidence that Petitioner knew he could have retreated with complete safety, there was no evidence on which the jury could not have found that the limitation in clause (b) applied to Petitioner. See State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai
'i 577, 592, 
994 P.2d 509, 524 (2000) (“As a rule, juries are presumed to follow all of the trial court’s instructions.” (Quoting State v. Knight, 80 Hawai
'i 318, 327, 909 P.2d 1133, 1142 (1996).)) 
(Ellipsis omitted.) Thus, clause (b) as it relates to Mark II was harmless error. 
3.
 
As noted supra, clause (a) of paragraph 7 relating to
 
provocation by Petitioner was erroneous and, thus, potentially
 harmful error with respect to Mark II. Nevertheless, it does not
 appear there was any evidence upon which an instruction as to the
 defense of others, in this case Martin and Daughter, could be
 based. In order to establish whether Petitioner’s substantial
 rights were affected, it must be determined “whether, from the
 
47
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
objective point of view of a reasonable person, the defendant's 
use of force was necessary for the protection of a person who would be justified in using such force, under the circumstances as the defendant subjectively believes them to be.” State v. 
Pavao, 81 Hawai
'i 142, 145, 913 P.2d 553, 556 (App. 1996). As to 
the counts in Mark II that Petitioner was charged with in his first trial, only two related to Petitioner’s use of force, and the jury only returned a conviction on Count I, regarding the second degree murder of Officer Gaspar. 
Any “protective force” Petitioner may have used in that
 
count amounted to deadly force, because it involved the shooting
 of Officer Gaspar. See HRS § 703-300 (“Intentionally firing a
 
firearm in the direction of another person . . . constitutes
 deadly force.”) In his Application, Petitioner argues that he
 “had every reason to believe that [Daughter] or [Martin] would
 get seriously injured or kidnapped.” Thus, it must be determined
 whether, under the circumstances as Petitioner must reasonably
 believe them to be, Martin or Daughter would have been justified
 in using deadly force.
 
Petitioner points to the following testimony in support
 
of his claim that he reasonably believed that Martin or Daughter
 would have been justified in using deadly force: (1) Petitioner
 testified that since the incident in Mark I “he had been hearing
 threats against himself and Martin,” (2) “[o]ne of the reasons
 why he did not turn himself in right away was because he was
 
48
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
afraid of what would happen to Martin if she were left alone,”
 
(3) Petitioner “testified that, when he and Martin were being
 chased by Piko, he thought he saw one of the men holding a gun,”
 and (4) “[t]he last time he saw Martin, she was by his side as he
 reached to put the necklace on [Daughter, and, i]n his mind,
 these were three large men, presumably friends of Piko and
 Paikai, who had gang tackled him without provocation.” 
Neither Martin nor Daughter testified at Petitioner’s
 
trial. Several witnesses in Baskin Robbins at the time of the
 struggle did testify. For example, Sennett, the mother of
 Daughter, testified that Petitioner was “not even a foot away
 from [Daughter]” when Officer Gaspar and Officer Sung entered
 Baskin Robbins. According to Sennett, Petitioner “started to
 back up a little[,]” and then
 
[t]hey walked up to him and he still had the necklace in his
hand, and as they were reaching for him, he dropped the
necklace, and they said, “Shane Mark,” . . . then he bent
down and started like going backwards, and the police
officers were trying to get him to stand completely up, and
he kept going and backed into the counter.
 
Kortz, Sennett’s boyfriend, testified that as
 
Petitioner was attempting to place the necklace around Daughter’s
 
neck, “two gentlemen came walking in from behind me and walked
 past me and past [Sennett] towards [Petitioner], and they made a
 comment to him or said something to him. [Petitioner] started to
 back up. When they – the two gentlemen started to grab for
 [Petitioner] and started to struggle[.]” 
49
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As discussed above, Petitioner testified that the first
 
time he noticed Officer Gaspar and Officer Sung was when they
 
attempted to grab him. Officer Sung testified that after he and
 Officer Gaspar had shown Petitioner their badges, he saw
 Petitioner reaching for something in his pocket, and immediately
 reached out for Petitioner. Petitioner points to no testimony by
 any of the witnesses at Baskin Robbins indicating that the
 officers used force or the threat of force against Martin or
 Daughter. Although Sennett testified that Petitioner was near
 Daughter at the time the officers grabbed him, the testimony
 indicates that the officers grabbed directly for Petitioner, and
 made no threats or attempts to grab Martin or Daughter.
 
As noted before, Petitioner testified that he and
 
Martin had been “hearing threats” and that he was “afraid of what
 would happen to Martin if she were left alone.” However,
 Petitioner’s own testimony indicates that under the circumstances
 known to him, the men were grabbing for him, and not for Martin
 or Daughter. As Petitioner stated he “had a feeling” that the
 men were “going to pull me out of the store” to “[t]ake me
 someplace and kill me.” Nothing in Petitioner’s testimony or in
 the testimony of the other witnesses would support a reasonable
 belief that it was necessary for Petitioner to use deadly force
 in order to protect Martin or Daughter.
 
Furthermore, there could not have been a reasonable
 
belief that either Martin or Daughter would have been justified
 
50
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in using deadly force. Although Petitioner did testify that he 
was “pretty scared” because Daughter could have gotten hurt, it does not appear that Petitioner offered testimony in this regard as to Martin. As discussed above, the witnesses’ testimony indicated that the officers grabbed Petitioner, focusing their attention on him and no one else. At the settling of Jury Instruction No. 65, Loy, Petitioner’s counsel, herself stated, “I don’t think [Daughter] would have the right to use deadly force. Deadly force is a greater degree of force than is justified.” Petitioner would not have been justified in using force that neither Martin nor Daughter were justified in using, “as the defense applies only when the third person being defended could himself or herself legitimately employ force.” Pavao, 81 Hawai
'i 
at 147, 913 P.2d at 558. 
Because under the circumstances as Petitioner believed
 
them to be, a reasonable person would not believe that Martin or
 Daughter would be justified in using deadly force, Petitioner was
 not justified in using deadly force, purportedly in their
 defense. Hence, Petitioner was not prejudiced by the error in
 clause (a) of paragraph 7 in Jury Instruction No. 65 with respect
 to Mark II. See id. (holding that because the defendant could
 
not have reasonably believed that the third person would have
 been justified in using force, the trial court’s finding of guilt
 was supported by substantial evidence). Although “a defendant is
 entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of defense
 
51
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
having any support in the evidence,” State v. Cabrera, 90 Hawai 'i 
359, 370, 978 P.2d 797, 808 (1999) (citation omitted), based on 
the evidence discussed above, there was no rational basis on which the jury could conclude that Petitioner was justified in using force for the protection of others. See State v. Kupihea, 
98 Hawai
'i 196, 206, 46 P.3d 498, 508 (2002) (holding that trial 
court was not required to include all statutory definitions in its instructions but, rather, “should refer only to those [definitions] having a rational basis in the evidence adduced at trial and not otherwise excludable”). 
Consequently, viewing the evidence as a whole, there is 
no reasonable possibility that the inclusion of paragraph 7, clause (a) relating to provocation, in Jury Instruction No. 65 contributed to Petitioner’s conviction. See State v. Arceo, 84 
Hawai
'i 1, 12, 928 P.2d 843, 854 (1996) (“Error is not to be 
viewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract. It must be examined in the light of the entire proceedings and . . . [i]n that context, the real question becomes whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to conviction.”) (Emphasis added.) (Citation omitted.) Based on the entire proceedings, clause (a) of paragraph 7 in Jury Instruction No. 65 as it relates to Mark II was harmless error. 
F.
 
In Petitioner’s second trial, the court’s instruction
 
on defense of others was identical to Jury Instruction No. 65,
 
52
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
except that the language in paragraph 7 related to retreat had
 
been altered to track the language related to retreat in HRS §
 703-305(2). However, the instruction retained the language on
 provocation as follows: 
The use of deadly force is not justifiable if the
defendant, with the intent of causing death or serious
bodily injury, provoked the use of force against himself in
the same encounter.
 
. . . When, under the law of justification based upon
self-defense, the defendant would’ve been obliged to retreat
or comply with a demand before using deadly force, he is not
obliged to do so before using deadly force to protect
another person unless he knows that he can thereby secure
the complete safety of the third person.
When, under the law of justification based upon self-
defense, the person whom the defendant seeks to protect
would be obliged to retreat or comply with a demand before
using deadly force if that person knew that he or she could
obtain complete safety by doing so, the defendant is obliged
to try to cause the person to do so before using deadly
force in the person’s protection if the defendant knows that
he can obtain the other’s complete safety in that way.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
Petitioner does not claim that the language related to
 
retreat in the court’s protection of others instruction in the
 
second trial was erroneous, and indeed, the ICA stated that
 “[Petitioner] appears to concede that this modified instruction
 resolves his objection to the language regarding the duty to
 retreat in paragraph 7 of the instructions given in the first
 trial.” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 528, 210 P.3d at 51. Because the 
language related to retreat in this instruction tracks the
 language in HRS § 703-305(2), this portion of the instruction was
 an accurate statement of the law.
 
However, the instruction continued to contain the same
 
erroneous language related to provocation by Petitioner as in
 
53
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
clause (a) of paragraph 7 in Jury Instruction No. 65. The ICA
 
“agree[d] with [Petitioner] on that point,” but held that the
 error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because
 
[t]he jury was instructed with regard to self-defense in the
second trial, and implicitly rejected that defense by
convicting [Petitioner] of the attempted first degree
assault of Officer Sung. Although there were some
differences in the evidence between the two trials,
nevertheless there was no evidence establishing that
[Petitioner] reasonably believed that Martin or Daughter
would have been justified in using deadly force to protect
themselves inside [] Baskin-Robbins.
 
Id. (footnote omitted). With this statement, the ICA implied
 
that because the jury “implicitly rejected” the defense of self-
defense, the defense of others defense was therefore unavailable
 to Petitioner. However, as discussed above, this conclusion by
 the ICA was wrong because the commentary to HRS § 703-305
 specifically provides that a defendant may be justified in using
 force to protect another person, even if the defendant himself or
 herself was not justified in using force for self protection. 
The only apparent difference in the evidence between
 
the two trials was that at his second trial, Petitioner testified
 that he was “worried” about Martin in Baskin Robbins because she
 was pregnant. Petitioner had not mentioned being “worried” about
 Martin during his first trial. Petitioner’s testimony at his
 second trial that he was “worried” about Martin does not alter
 the conclusion reached above in regard to the court’s instruction
 on protection of others. 
There was no evidence adduced at Petitioner’s second
 
trial that would have given rise to a reasonable belief that
 
54
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Martin would have been justified in using deadly force to protect
 
herself. The testimony in regard to the actions of the officers
 was the same, in that they grabbed for Petitioner, and did not
 threaten Martin or Daughter in any way. Therefore, as with
 clause (a) of paragraph 7 in Jury Instruction No. 65, Petitioner
 was not prejudiced by the language related to provocation in the
 instruction on protection of others in his second trial.
 
G.
 
Related to Petitioner’s claim of erroneous jury
 
instructions, Petitioner also argues in a footnote in his
 Application that “[i]n [his] Reply Brief, [Petitioner] raised an
 additional issue regarding the [court’s] failure to give a
 complete definition of Kidnapping. [Petitioner] would again
 renew the request to consider this as plain error.” Petitioner
 makes no further argument regarding this issue in his
 Application.
 
In his Reply Brief, Petitioner stated that, during his
 
first trial, he testified that he thought the men “were robbing
 the Baskin Robbins store” and that, in his second trial, he
 testified that “[t]hese guys go take my money.” Petitioner
 stated that “theft of property from the person of another is a
 Class C felony,” and HRS § 707-720 (1993) with respect to
 kidnapping states that 
[a] person commits the offense of kidnapping if the person
intentionally or knowingly restrains another person with
intent to:
 
. . . .
 
55
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(c) Facilitate the commission of a felony or flight
thereafter;
(d) Inflict bodily injury upon that person or
(e) Terrorize that person or a third person[.] subject that person to a sexual offense; [or]
(Emphasis added.) 
Petitioner stated that “[i]n his case, for both trials,
 
the court gave the following definition of kidnapping, which
 
covered only [HRS § 707-720(d) and HRS § 707-720(e)]: 
“‘A person
 
commits kidnapping if he intentionally or knowingly restrains
 another person with intent to inflict bodily injury upon that
 person or terrorize that person.’” Petitioner argued that the
 court’s instruction was plainly erroneous because the instruction
 did not cover HRS § 707-720(c) relating to the commission of a
 felony. 
It does not appear that the ICA addressed Petitioner’s 
argument regarding an allegedly erroneous definition of kidnapping, nor did Respondent address this issue in its memorandum in opposition. Petitioner did not object to the court’s kidnapping instruction at trial. Additionally, Petitioner acknowledged in his Reply Brief that “[t]his specific argument was not raised as a point of error in the opening brief.” Thus, we are not obligated to address Petitioner’s argument regarding the court’s purportedly erroneous kidnapping instruction. See In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 Hawai
'i 1, 
14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994) (holding that arguments raised for the first time in the reply briefs on appeal were 
56
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
deemed waived) (citation omitted); Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(d) (2005) (providing that “[t]he reply brief 
shall be confined to matters presented in the answering brief”). 
However, because Petitioner’s assertion relates to jury 
instructions, whether the court’s instruction was plain error is briefly discussed. See State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai
'i 327, 335, 
141 P.3d 974, 982 (2006) (holding that the plain error and harmless error standards of review merge in the case of jury instructions, because “the duty to properly instruct the jury lies with the trial court[,]” and, thus, “the same standard of review is to be applied both in cases in which a timely objection to a jury instruction was made and those in which no timely objection was made”). In the case of jury instructions, “once instructional error is demonstrated, we will vacate, without regard to whether timely objection was made, if there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the defendant’s conviction, i.e., that the erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 337, 141 
P.3d at 984 (emphasis added). The questions to be addressed, then, are (1) whether there was instructional error and (2) whether any such error was harmless. 
Again, as to whether instructional error occurred,
 
“[w]hen jury instructions or the omission thereof are at issue on
 appeal, the standard of review is whether, when read and
 considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially
 
57
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.” State v. 
Gonsalves, 108 Hawai 'i 289, 292, 119 P.3d 597, 600 (2005) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). 
In this case, it does not appear that any prejudice resulted from the court’s instructions. Petitioner’s theory is that, based on his statement in the second trial that “[t]hese guys go take my 
29
 money[,]” there is a reasonable possibility that the jury might
have concluded that Petitioner was justified in using deadly
 force in order to prevent a kidnapping, because he believed the
 officers were “intentionally or knowingly restrain[ing] another
 
person with intent to . . . [f]acilitate the commission of a
  
felony[,]” i.e., theft. However, based only on the lone
 
statement of “taking my money,” there would not be a reasonable
 possibility that any potential error regarding the kidnapping
 instruction might have contributed to Petitioner’s conviction,
 and thus, his argument that this court should recognize plain
 error must be rejected.
 
29 The testimony upon which Petitioner relies was as follows:
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] Q. -- that they were reaching
around your pocket area?
[PETITIONER] A. They was reaching in my
pockets.
Q. And, what -- when they reached in your
pockets, what did you think?
A. These guys go take my money.
 
Petitioner does not point to any testimony or other evidence indicating his
actions against the officers were taken because he believed they were going to
steal his money.

As to his second question, Petitioner maintains in his
 
Application that the “[c]oncurrent representation of Piko and
 [Petitioner] should have led to imputed disqualification of the
 [OPD] requiring a mistrial and appointment of new counsel.” 
Petitioner asserts that the OPD represented Piko “from 2001 to
 2002[, t]he OPD continued its representation of Piko in April of
 2004[,]” and that “[d]uring this time, the OPD was also
 representing [Petitioner] during his two trials starting from
 March of 2003.” According to Petitioner, DPD Ho “testified that
 within the OPD, there was ‘free sharing of information.’ . . .
 There was no screening procedure to prevent [DPDs] from
 discussing client confidences with other [DPDs].” 
Petitioner avers that the OPD was required to find
 
evidence to impeach Piko, including evidence in the OPD’s files,
 and the fact that it “supposedly did not discover [the] conflict
 until July of 2004 would indicate that [it] placed Piko’s
 confidentiality above [Petitioner’s] need for the evidence. 
Additionally, Petitioner argues that “the ICA never directly
 addressed the defense’s assertion that, if a public defender’s
 office is to be treated as a private law firm rather than a
 government office, then there should be an imputed
 disqualification for all the attorneys in the office.” He claims
 
59
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that “[o]ther jurisdictions have found that any confidential
 
information obtained by a public defender from a client must be
 imputed to other members of the public defender’s staff.” 
2. 
Respondent disagrees, claiming that Hawai 'i Rules of 
Professional Conduct (HRPC) Rule 1.730 and Rule 1.9 31
 “do not
 
require after-the-fact disqualification.” Respondent relies
 entirely on the ICA’s holding on this issue, discussed further
 infra, in support of its conclusion that “Petitioner’s accusation
does not constitute a basis to grant his Application.” 
 
3.
 
The ICA “assume[d,] 
arguendo that OPD was one ‘firm 
within the meaning of HRPC Rule 1.10”32 and determined “that 
[Piko] was a former client of OPD in July 2004.” Mark, 120 
Hawai'i at 532-33, 210 P.3d at 55-56 (emphasis added). The ICA 
concluded that (1) “[c]ourts from other jurisdictions have found no conflict of interest based on defense counsel’s prior representation of a witness, when the witness had already been sentenced before the commencement of trial[,]” (2) “[t]he conclusion that Rule 1.9 governs here is also consistent with Richie[,]” (3) “[t]he [court] properly determined that the denial of [Petitioner’s Motion] would not result in a violation of Rule 
30

32
 See discussion of HRPC Rule 1.10 infra.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1.9(c)[,]” and (4) “there is nothing in the record establishing
 
that there was any adverse effect on [Loy’s] actual performance
 at trial.” Id. at 534-35, 210 P.3d at 56-58. The ICA held that
 
the court “did not abuse its discretion in denying the
 motions[.]” Id. at 535, 210 P.3d at 58.
 
In regard to Petitioner’s contention that Petitioner’s
 
Motion “should have been granted” because “the OPD was
 representing both Piko and [Petitioner] concurrently in April
 2004, when Piko’s probation was being revoked and [Petitioner]
 was waiting for his second trial to begin[,]” the ICA concluded
 that “[i]t is undisputed that the OPD was unaware of that
 concurrent representation when it was occurring, and thus it had
 no effect on the representation of either client at that time.” 
Id. The ICA held that “[i]n the circumstances of this case,
 
Rules 1.7 and 1.9 do not require after-the-fact
 disqualification.” Id. 
B.
 
This court granted the OPD leave to file an Amicus
 
Curiae brief (Amicus) with respect to the specific issue of
 “(1) how the [ICA’s] May 8, 2009 opinion on the issue of
 conflicts of interest affects the interests of the OPD; and
 (2) how the May 8, 2009 opinion impacts the OPD’s criteria to
 determine whether a conflict of interest exists.” This court
 ordered Respondent to file a response to the Amicus brief
 (Response to Amicus).
 
61
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
C.
 
1.
 
HRPC Rule 1.7 sets forth the standard for when a
 
conflict arises in the context of concurrent representation of
 multiple clients:
 
Rule 1.7. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: GENERAL RULE.
 (a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the
representation of that client will be directly adverse to
another client, unless:
 (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation
will not adversely affect
 the relationship with the other
client; and
 (2) each client consents after consultation.
 (b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the
representation of that client may be materially limited by
the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client or to a
third person, or by the lawyer’s own interests, unless:
(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation
will not be adversely affected; and
(2) the client consents after consultation. When
 
representation of multiple clients in a single matter is
undertaken, the consultation shall include explanation of
the implications of the common representation and the
advantages and risks involved.
 
(Emphases added.) Thus, under the rules, a lawyer may not
 
concurrently represent a client if such representation is
 “directly adverse” to another client, or if representation might
 be jeopardized by obligations arising out of representation of
 another client. 
With regard to a lawyer’s obligations of loyalty to his
 
or her client, Comments 3 and 4 to HRPC Rule 1.7 provides that:
 
[3] As a general proposition, loyalty to a client
prohibits undertaking representation directly adverse to
that client without that client’s consent. Paragraph (a)
expresses that general rule. Thus, a lawyer ordinarily may
not act as advocate against a person the lawyer represents
in some other matter, even if it is wholly unrelated. On
 the other hand, simultaneous representation in unrelated
matters of clients whose interests are only generally
adverse, such as competing economic enterprises, does not
require consent of the respective clients. Paragraph (a)
applies only when the representation of one client would be
 
62
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
directly adverse to the other.
[4] Loyalty to a client is also impaired when a
lawyer cannot consider, recommend or carry out an
appropriate course of action for the client because of the
lawyer’s other responsibilities or interests. The conflict
 in effect forecloses alternatives that would otherwise be
 available to the client. Paragraph (b) addresses such
situations. A possible conflict does not itself preclude
the representation. The critical questions are the
likelihood that a conflict will eventuate and, if it does,
whether it will materially interfere with the lawyer’s
independent professional judgment in considering
alternatives or foreclose courses of action that reasonably
should be pursued on behalf of the client. Consideration
 should be given to whether the client wishes to accommodate
the other interest involved.
 
(Emphases added.) Regarding conflicts that arise in the context
 
of litigation, the Commentary states in relevant part: 
Paragraph (a) prohibits representation of opposing
parties in litigation. Simultaneous representation of
parties whose interests in litigation may conflict, such as
co-plaintiffs or co-defendants, is governed by paragraph
(b). An impermissible conflict may exist by reason of
substantial discrepancy in the parties’ testimony,
incompatibility in positions in relation to an opposing
party or the fact that there are substantially different
possibilities of settlement of the claims or liabilities in
question. Such conflicts can arise in criminal cases as
 well as civil. The potential for conflict of interest in
representing multiple defendants in a criminal case is so
grave that ordinarily a lawyer should decline to represent
more than one co-defendant. On the other hand, common
representation of persons having similar interests is proper
if the risk of adverse effect is minimal and the
 requirements of paragraph (b) are met. . . .
 
Comment 7 to HRPC Rule 1.7 (emphases added).
 
HRPC Rule 1.9 sets forth the standard for adjudging
 
whether a conflict is present in the context of former
 
representation:
 
Rule 1.9. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: FORMER CLIENT.
 
(a) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in
a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in
the same or a substantially related matter in which that
person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests
of the former client unless the former client consents after
 consultation.
 
(b) A lawyer shall not knowingly represent a person in
the same or a substantially related matter in which a firm
with which the lawyer formerly was associated had previously
represented a client
 
63
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(1) whose interests are materially adverse to that
person; and
(2) about whom the lawyer had acquired information
protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the
matter; unless the former client consents after
consultation.
 
(c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in
a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly
represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:
(1) use information relating to the representation to
the disadvantage of the former client except as Rule 1.6 or
Rule 3.3 would permit or require with respect to a client,
or when the information has become generally known; or
(2) reveal information relating to the representation
except as Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3 would permit or require with
respect to a client.[
33]
 
(Emphases added.) 
2. 
In Richie, this court set forth the standard for
 
determining when a conflict arises amounting to ineffective
 
assistance of counsel under the Hawai 'i Constitution, based on 
the federal standard as well as HRPC Rule 1.7. Richie, 88
 
Hawai'i at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252. This court first noted that, 
under federal law,
 
the defendant must demonstrate that his attorney actively
represented conflicting interests and that an actual
conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer’s
performance. As noted above, proof of actual prejudice is
 not required. Furthermore, a defendant may knowingly,
intelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to
conflict-free representation.
 
33 HRPC Rule 1.6 outlines certain instances wherein an attorney is
permitted or mandated to reveal information relating to representation. The
 rule allows “for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry
out the representation” and further permits the attorney to reveal information
to prevent criminal activity under certain circumstances, or to defend the
attorney in a suit brought by the client. The rule further mandates
 disclosure of “information which clearly establishes a criminal or fraudulent
act of the client in the furtherance of which the lawyer's services had been
used[.]”
 
HRPC Rule 3.3 prohibits an attorney from providing false
information to the court, and places an obligation on the attorney to disclose
information to the court “when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a
criminal or fraudulent act by the client[.]”
 
64
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphases 
added). Thus, Richie explained that, based on HRPC Rule 1.7 and federal law, three factors are relevant in determining whether a conflict rises to the level of ineffective assistance: “The first factor is whether a relationship existed between the attorney and his/her clients giving rise to a conflict. The second factor is whether the relationship had an adverse effect on counsel’s performance. And the third factor is whether counsel obtained the consent of his/her clients.” Id. (emphases 
added). However, in formulating the Hawai
'i standard, this court 
did not require that all three factors be present in order for assistance to be ineffective, but that there must be “(1) a relationship giving rise to a conflict of interest . . . between defense counsel and his/her clients; and (2) either the relationship adversely affected defense counsel’s performance, or the client did not consent to the relationship.” Id. (emphases 
added). Thus, where there is a “relationship giving rise to a conflict” and absence of consent, assistance will be considered 
constitutionally ineffective. As to what types of relationships 
“giv[e] rise” to a conflict, this court listed as “[e]xamples,” 
“joint representation of two or more co-defendants and [pertinent to this case] concurrent representation of both the defendant and . . . a prosecution witness.” Id. (emphasis added). 
65
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3.
 
The court determined, and the ICA affirmed, that in 
this case, OPD’s representation of Piko was “former” 
representation, and not concurrent representation of both Petitioner, i.e., the defendant, and Piko, i.e., a prosecution witness. Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 533, 210 P.3d at 56. Thus, the 
standard set forth in Rule 1.9, and not Rule 1.7, was applicable. Although Richie did not deal with former representation under Rule 1.9, but only with concurrent representation under Rule 1.7, the standard set forth therein should be applicable in either 
context, inasmuch as both pertain to conflicts of interest. 
However, different standards for what constitutes a “relationship 
giving rise to a conflict” govern depending on which rule is applied. See Fragiao v. State, 95 Hawai
'i 9, 18, 18 P.3d 871, 
880 (2001) (“To determine whether a relationship giving rise to a conflict of interest existed, we turn to the HRPC for guidance. 
Satisfaction of the first prong of the Richie test depends on whether the relevant HRPC provisions would prohibit [the 
attorney] from representing [the client].”) (Citation omitted.) (Emphasis added.) 
Thus, while under Rule 1.7, the status of the clients
 
as “defendant” and “prosecution witness” alone would constitute a
 relationship giving rise to a conflict where there is concurrent
 representation, under Rule 1.9, subsequent representation of
 another client would be permissible so long as it is not in the
 
66
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
context of “the same or a substantially related matter” and the
 
lawyer refrains from “us[ing] information relating to the
 representation to the disadvantage of the former client except
 . . . when the information has become generally known; or []
 reveal[ing] information relating to the representation[.]” Thus,
 first it must be determined whether the court or the ICA erred in
 concluding that OPD’s representation of Piko was “former”
 representation as opposed to “concurrent.”
 
4.
 
As recognized by the ICA,
 
Rule 1.9 does not define what it means for an attorney to
have “formerly” represented a client. The comment to the
 rule notes only that “[a]fter termination of a client-lawyer
relationship, a lawyer may not represent another client
except in conformity with this rule.” The [American Bar
Association’s (ABA)] Annotated Model Rules of Professional
Conduct (5th ed. 2003) (“Annotated Model Rules”) notes that
“[t]here is no per se rule regarding when a client becomes a
former client.” Annotated Model Rules at 173.
 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 533, 210 P.3d at 56 (emphasis added). 
Comments 1 and 2 to Rule 1.9 further states:
 
[1] After termination of a client-lawyer
relationship, a lawyer may not represent another client
except in conformity with this rule. The principles in Rule
1.7 determine whether the interests of the present and
former client are adverse. Thus, a lawyer could not
properly seek to rescind on behalf of a new client a
contract drafted on behalf of the former client. So also a
 lawyer who has prosecuted an accused person could not
properly represent the accused in a subsequent civil action
against the government concerning the same transaction.
[2] The scope of a “matter” for purposes of this rule
may depend on the facts of a particular situation or
transaction. The lawyer’s involvement in a matter can also
be a question of degree. When a lawyer has been directly
involved in a specific transaction, subsequent
representation of other clients with materially adverse
interests clearly is prohibited. On the other hand, a
lawyer who recurrently handled a type of problem for a
former client is not necessarily precluded from later
representing another client in a wholly distinct problem of
that type even though the subsequent representation involves
 
67
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a position adverse to the prior client. Similar
 
considerations can apply to the reassignment of military
lawyers between defense and prosecution functions within the
same military jurisdiction. The underlying question is
whether the lawyer was so involved in the matter that the
subsequent representation can be justly regarded as a
changing of sides in the matter in question.
 
(Emphases added.) Thus, subsequent representation is prohibited
 
where the subsequent client’s interests are adverse to the former
 client with regard to “the same transaction.”
 
The ICA, like the court, “conclude[d] that [Piko] was a
 
former client of OPD in July 2004[,]” because “Piko’s probation
 violation had been adjudicated and Piko had been re-sentenced to
 a new term of probation in April 2004, approximately three months
 before the second trial.” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 533, 210 P.3d at 
56. The ICA further deemed relevant that
 
[t]he [court] found in [finding] 4 that the OPD did not
“have any matters pending with regard to Piko” in July 2004
and had closed [its] file, and there is substantial evidence
to support that finding. OPD’s closing of the file implies
that it understood that it would not be called upon to use
the file again, absent some unforeseen future event. The
 mere possibility that such an event could occur is
insufficient to convert what would otherwise be former
 representation into concurrent representation for the
purposes of the HRPC. Moreover, there is nothing in the
record indicating that Piko had any understanding that his
representation by OPD was ongoing after his re-sentencing in
April 2004.
 
Id. 
The court, in determining that no conflict existed
 
based on OPD’s “former” representation of Piko, made the
 
following relevant findings and conclusions:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. [Ho] testified that [Piko] previously had been
represented by [Burks] of [OPD].
2. [Burks] previously represented Piko in a matter
that resulted in him being placed on his current probation.
 
68
 3. Piko has never waived his attorney-client
privilege.
4. Neither [Burks] nor the [OPD] have any matters
pending with regard to Piko and the [OPD] has closed his
file.
 
5. Ho had never assigned either [Loy] or [Marshall] to
handle any matters regarding Piko.
6. Piko’s files, which came in existence during his
relationship with [Burks], are in Ho’s office and if
instructed by the court he would not allow anyone access to
the files.
 
7. Ho had no knowledge of either [Loy] or [Marshall]
having gained access to Piko’s files or having learned of
any confidential attorney-client communications had between
Piko and [Burks].
8. [Loy] had not learned of any secrets of Piko nor
did she have knowledge of any confidential attorney-client
communications had between Piko and [Burks].
9. [Loy] informed the court that she had never worked
on Piko’s case.
 
10. Piko’s conviction for forgery and his status as a
probationer are matters of public record, which [OPD] could
acquire.
11. [Petitioner’s] trial does not involve either the
same or any matter substantially related to the facts and
circumstances regarding the case in which Piko was placed on
probation.
***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
12. [OPD] never represented Piko for any matter
related to the alleged parking lot shooting for which
[Petitioner] is currently standing trial.
13. Piko’s prior case with [OPD] is completely
unrelated to any of the circumstances in the instant trial
involving Defendant.
14. [Loy] represented to the court that she intended
to call Piko as her own witness.
 
15. [Loy] informed the court that Piko’s testimony
would benefit the defense theory, notwithstanding the
possibility that he might be subject to impeachment with his
forgery conviction and his current status as a probationer
in the event he does not testify in accordance with the
testimony he gave during [Petitioner’s] prior trial and
other statements he made.
 
16. [Loy’s] ability to represent zealously the
interests of [Petitioner] will not be affected by Piko’s
status as former client of [OPD].
17. [Loy] did not identify any limitation on her
ability to represent zealously [Petitioner] due to [Burks’]
prior representation of Piko.
 
. . . .
 
22. Neither [Loy] nor [Marshall] will attempt to gain
access to confidential attorney-client files of Piko created
as a result of [Burks’] representation of him or knowledge
of any confidential attorney-client communications had
between them.
 
23. In order to ensure and prevent any conflicts of
interest, [OPD] is disqualified immediately from
representing [Piko] in any matter here on.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. Based upon the evidence the court found credible,
and the representations of counsel, there is no basis to
conclude that confidential attorney-client communications
had between [Burks] and Piko will be communicated to either
[Loy] or [Marshall].
. . . . [
34
]
3. Because nothing currently is pending with regard to
[Piko] and [OPD] considers his case closed, his relationship
with [OPD] is not concurrent. Piko’s status is that of a
 prior or former client for purposes of conflict analysis.
4. Piko’s status as a former or prior client makes
 
[Richie] distinguishable from the situation in the instant
matter, because the case dealt with one defense lawyer
concurrently representing the defendant and a key state
witness, creating a clearly, inherently, and directly
adverse conflict. Whereas, in the instant matter, neither
[Loy] nor [Marshall] ever represented Piko, and only
[Petitioner], not Piko, is a current client of [OPD].
5. Pursuant to [HRPC Rule 1.9], a lawyer who formerly
represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter
represent another person in the same or a substantially
related matter in which that person’s interests (to wit
those of [Petitioner]) are materially adverse to the
interests of the former client unless the former client
 consents after consultation.
 
6. The commentary to [HRPC Rule 1.9] notes that the
principles of [HRPC Rule 1.7] determine whether the
interests of the present and former client are adverse.
7. Neither [Loy] nor [Marshall] are acting as an
advocate against [Petitioner], whom they currently
represent, thus there is no violation of [HRPC Rule 1.7].
8. Inasmuch as neither [Loy] nor [Marshall] ever
represented Piko, and there being no evidence of any
relationship that exists or existed between him and [Loy] or
[Marshall], counsels’ ability to represent [Petititioner]
will not be materially limited due to [Burks’] prior
representation of Piko.
9. There has been no showing of any specific material
limitation that will arise in [Loy’s] representation of
[Petitioner] based upon [Burks’] prior representation of
Piko.
 
10. Piko’s conviction for forgery and his status as a
probationer are public record and not matters of
confidential attorney-client communications.
11. [Loy] will be allowed to adduce evidence regarding
Piko’s conviction for forgery and his status as a
probationer, as such information is public record and the
prosecution has so acknowledged and agreed to its
admissibility.
12. Neither [Loy’s] nor [Marshall’s] duties and
responsibilities to [Petitioner] require that they attempt
to gain access to Piko’s confidential attorney-client files
that came into existence as a result of [Burks’]
representation of him.
 
34
 Conclusion 2, which indicated that OPD is “more akin to a law firm
than a government office[,]” was deleted by the court.
 
70
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13. Neither [Loy’s] nor [Marshall’s] duties or
responsibilities to [Petitioner] require that they attempt
to gain knowledge of confidential attorney-client
communications had between Piko and [Burks].
14. [Loy’s], as well as [Marshall’s] loyalty to
[Petitioner] is undivided and will not be affected adversely
by [Burks’] prior represenation of Piko.
15. Neither [Loy] nor [Marshall] has a duty of loyalty
to Piko resulting from [Burks’] prior representation of him.
16. The inadmissibility of evidence regarding any
confidential attorney-client communications had between Piko
and [Burks] . . . is based upon the attorney-client
privilege and as such does not demonstrate [Loy’s] lack of
loyalty or ability to represent effectively [Petitioner]. 
. . . 
17. Neither [Loy’s] nor [Marshall’s] representation of
[Petitioner] is directly adverse to [Burks’] prior
representation of Piko.
18. [Burks’] prior representation of Piko is not
directly adverse to either [Loy’s] or [Marshall’s]
representation of [Petitioner].
 
(Emphases added.)35 Manifestly, then, the court concluded that
 
OPD’s representation of Piko was prior, as opposed to concurrent,
 
to its representation of Petitioner, making Rule 1.9 applicable. 
The court determined that there was no conflict under
 
Rule 1.9, because OPD’s subsequent representation of Petitioner
 was not “in the same or a substantially related matter in which
 [Petitioner’s] interests are materially adverse to the interests
 of the former client,” inasmuch as Piko’s previous forgery charge
 was entirely unrelated to the events leading to the charges
 against Petitioner, and Petitioner’s interests were not adverse 
35
 Although the court did not state upon what it based the finding
that OPD is more akin to a private firm, OPD argues that there was
“substantial evidence in the record to support the circuit court’s finding[,]”
such as the sharing of confidential information, the use of file storage
facilities accessible to all DPDs, DPDs “standing in” for other DPDs at trial
and hearings when it is required, and the agency relationship of public
defenders to the State Public Defender. However, as discussed infra, these
facts are not applicable inasmuch as Piko was a former client at the time he
gave his testimony and the subsequent representation of Petitioner was
manifestly not part of “the same or a substantially related matter[.]” HRPC
 Rule 1.9.
 
71
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to Piko’s as to the forgery charge but only with regard to a
 
completely distinct matter. Furthermore, the court concluded
 there was no evidence that Loy or Marshall would “use information
 relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former
 client except . . . information [that] has become generally
 known[,]” i.e., Piko’s prior conviction, or “reveal information
 relating to the representation[.]” See HRPC Rule 1.9.

D.
 1.
 
Despite the fact that OPD’s representation of Piko
 
could have been properly considered former after April 2004, and,
 indeed, after the July 2004 hearing in which the court precluded
 OPD from further representation of Piko in any context, plainly,
 there was a period of concurrent representation prior to the
 
36 With regard to confidentiality, Comment 6 to Rule 1.9 provides as
follows:
 
[6] Preserving confidentiality is a question of
access to information. Access to information, in turn, is
essentially a question of fact in particular circumstances,
aided by inferences, deductions or working presumptions that
reasonably may be made about the way in which lawyers work
together. A lawyer may have general access to files of all
clients of a law firm and may regularly participate in
discussions of their affairs; it should be inferred that
such a lawyer in fact is privy to all information about all
the firm’s clients. In contrast, another lawyer may have
access to the files of only a limited number of clients and
participate in discussions of the affairs of no other
clients; in the absence of information to the contrary, it
should be inferred that such a lawyer in fact is privy to
information about the clients actually served but not those
of other clients.
 
(Emphasis added.) The court’s findings indicate that, based on the specific
facts of this case, Petitioner’s attorneys’ access to the files regarding
OPD’s former representation of Piko was limited. Upon this record, it does
not appear that those findings were clearly erroneous. 
72
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
second trial. As noted by the ICA, “Ho testified that in his 
opinion, [OPD’s] representation of Piko and [Petitioner] was concurrent because while the office ‘was active with [Petitioner’s] case, [Piko] came back on a probation revocation and then [OPD] represented both defendants at the same time.’” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 529, 210 P.3d at 52. Thus, there was a 
period of concurrent representation. 
The ICA rejected Petitioner’s assertion that the
 
previous period of concurrent representation created a conflict. 
The ICA noted Petitioner’s argument that 
even if [OPD] was not concurrently representing [Petitioner]
and Piko at the time of [Petitioner’s] second trial in July
2004, the motions should have been granted based on the fact
that [OPD] was representing both Piko and [Petitioner]
concurrently in April 2004, when Piko’s probation was being
revoked and [Petitioner] was waiting for his second trial to
begin.
 
Id. at 535, 210 P.3d at 58 (emphasis added). However, the ICA
 
“reject[ed] this argument” because “[i]t is undisputed that [OPD]
 was unaware of that concurrent representation when it was
 occurring, and thus, it had no effect on the representation of
 either client at that time. In the circumstances of this case,
 Rules 1.7 and 1.9 do not require after-the-fact
 disqualification.” Id. (citation omitted). The ICA noted that
 
“we do not mean to suggest that a lawyer will always avoid
 disqualification in circumstances where the lawyer was unaware of
 a potential conflict.” Id. at 536 n.27, 210 P.3d at 59 n.27. 
While that point is cogent, especially with regard to a
 
single lawyer whose multiple representation gives rise to a
 
73
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conflict, it is worth noting that, with respect to attorneys
 
working for a law firm, Rule 1.10 is also relevant, requiring
 that “[w]hile lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them
 shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them
 practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so[.]” (Emphasis
 added.) Clearly, Loy’s and Burks’ representation of Petitioner
 and Piko, respectively, in April 2004, was not “knowing” as to
 representation by the other and, thus, would not directly violate
 Rule 1.10.
 
2.
 
Although not precisely on point, Richie is instructive
 
in determining, in the case of either prior or concurrent
 representation, whether at a given point in time, the nature of
 the attorney-client relationship is one that gives rise to a
 conflict. Although the ICA discussed the facts of Richie as
 being supportive of its conclusion, it is unclear how the ICA
 applied Richie. With regard to the facts of Richie, the ICA
 stated that
 
[t]he conclusion that Rule 1.9 governs here is also
consistent with Richie. The defendant in Richie was
 
convicted of promoting prostitution, after he had been paid
to provide several women to perform as exotic dancers at a
bachelor party. One of those women, Monica Alves [(Alves)],
had been a codefendant in the case, but the charges against
her had been dismissed by the time of Richie’s trial.
Richie was represented at trial by two attorneys. On
 appeal, Richie asserted “that the performance of his trial
counsel was constitutionally ineffective based on a conflict
of interest” where “one of his trial attorneys was
representing [] Alves in a civil suit at the same time the
attorney was representing Richie in the present case.”
The supreme court concluded that while trial counsel’s
decision to represent Alves in the civil case was “at the
very least, unwise, under the particular circumstances of
this case, we do not believe that trial counsel’s
 
74
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
relationship with his clients was sufficient to give rise to
a conflict of interest.” The court observed that (1) by the
time Richie’s trial began, the charges against Alves had
been dismissed, and Alves was no longer a codefendant in
Richie's case; (2) although Alves was a potential
prosecution witness, she was not actually called to testify;
and (3) that Richie “was represented by two attorneys at
trial, and only one of those was involved in Alves's civil
suit.”
 
In sum, Richie involved potential concurrent
representation. The supreme court expressly noted that
“prior representation is not at issue in the present case.”
Thus, while Richie is instructive with regard to the supreme
court’s application of HRPC Rule 1.7, it is consistent with
our conclusion that the circuit court properly determined
that Rule 1.9, rather than Rule 1.7, governed the situation
here.
 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 534, 210 P.3d at 57 (emphases added) 
(internal citation, ellipsis, and brackets omitted). It is not
 
evident from the ICA’s discussion how Richie “is consistent with
 [the] conclusion” that Rule 1.9 should apply. It is necessary
 that the ICA’s discussion on this point be clarified.
 
As noted above, in Richie, one of the defendant’s trial
 
attorneys represented Alves, a former co-defendant and potential
 prosecution witness, in a civil suit at the same time the
 attorney was representing Richie. 88 Hawai
'i at 41, 960 P.2d at 
1249. This court concluded that there was no conflict due to
 concurrent representation in that case, based on the following:
 
First, it is apparently undisputed that trial counsel
represented both Richie in the present case and Alves in a
separate civil case. Inasmuch as Alves was an obvious
 potential witness in the present case, trial counsel’s
decision to represent Alves in the civil case was, at the
very least, unwise. However, based on the particular
circumstances of the present case, we do not believe that
trial counsel’s relationship with Richie and Alves supports
an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. By the time
Richie went to trial, the charges against Alves had been
dismissed; therefore, she was no longer a co-defendant in
the present case. Furthermore, Alves was never actually
called as a witness in this case. Although she was clearly
a potential witness, she was not an actual witness.
Therefore, Alves was neither a co-defendant nor a
prosecution witness in Richie’s trial. Moreover, Richie was
 
75
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
represented by two attorneys at trial, and it appears that
only one of these attorneys was involved in Alves’s civil
suit. Consequently, under the particular circumstances of
this case, we do not believe that trial counsel’s
relationship with his clients was sufficient to give rise to
a conflict of interest.
 
Id. at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252 (some emphases in original and some
 
added) (emphasis omitted). 
Hence, Richie indicates that, although a “relationship
 
giving rise to a conflict” may exist at a certain point in time,
 i.e., prior to trial, if that relationship ceases prior to the
 development of an actual conflict, then counsel is not
 necessarily ineffective, depending on the “particular
 circumstances of the [] case[.]” See id. In Richie, it appears
 
that, at some point prior to trial, Alves was both a co-defendant
 and a potential witness, and thus, concurrent representation
 would have given rise to a conflict at that time; however, Richie
 relied on the fact that “[b]y the time Richie went to trial,
 . . . [Alves] was no longer a co-defendant” and she did not
 appear as a prosecution witness. Id. (emphasis added). Thus,
 
under the particular circumstances of that case, no conflict
 materialized.
 
3.
 
Similarly, here, prior to Petitioner’s second trial,
 
when Piko’s case was re-opened due to a violation of his
 probation, OPD concurrently represented Piko and Petitioner for a
 period of time when Piko was a potential prosecution witness. 
During that particular time period, a “relationship giving rise
 
76
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to a conflict” potentially existed between OPD, Piko, and
 
Petitioner. OPD maintains that “the ICA placed too much reliance
 on the fact that Piko’s physical file had been closed [and] was
 stored in a room designated for closed files.” According to OPD,
 the practice of when a file should be closed varies from attorney
 to attorney and, as such, should not be a measure for when
 representation has ended.
37
 
However, “[b]y the time [Petitioner] went to trial” in
 
the second trial, Piko’s case file was closed, and OPD was no
 longer actively representing Piko. Furthermore, if any question
 remained as to whether OPD still held any responsibilities with
 regard to Piko, the court officially terminated any future OPD
 representation of Piko at the July 2004 hearing, prior to the
 time when Petitioner called Piko as an adverse witness.
38 Thus,
 
at the time Loy engaged in her cross-examination of Piko at
 trial, there is no question that OPD’s representation of Piko had
 ceased. As explained supra, HRPC Rule 1.9, subsequent
 representation of another client (in this case, Petitioner,) is
 permissible so long as it is not in the context of “the same or a 
37
 OPD asserts that “[r]epresentation does not cease when a defendant
is sentenced to a probationary term. Representation continues while defendant
is on probation.” OPD claims that “every new case [that] is initiated by
complaint, information or indictment, is assigned a new criminal number,” but
no new numbers are assigned and “reappointment is not necessary [post-
sentencing] because the attorney who represented the defendant at sentencing
continues to represent the defendant on post-sentencing matters.” However,
OPD does not explain how this would prevent it from implementing effective
screening procedures to avoid potential conflicts. 
38
 Piko was not called by the prosecution.
 
77
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
substantially related matter” and counsel refrains from using the
 
information obtained through that prior representation to the
 detriment of the former client. Here, it is evident that Loy did
 not access or use information in Piko’s file. 
4.
 
For the reasons stated above, and based on the 
particular circumstances of this case, the ICA did not gravely err in concluding that the court did not abuse its discretion by applying the standard for “former” representation under Rule 1.9 in denying Petitioner’s motion for mistrial. The proceedings in which OPD represented Petitioner were not “the same or [] substantially related” to those in which it previously represented Piko, and there was no evidence that OPD would “use . . . or [] reveal [confidential] information relating to the representation” of Piko, and, instead, substantial evidence was presented that OPD would not use any information obtained by virtue of its previous representation of Piko.
39 See Mark, 120 
Hawai'i at 530, 210 P.3d at 53. 
39 OPD argues that, “[i]f the motion [to withdraw] would have been
granted prior to the commencement of trial, the same motion should be granted
during trial, especially prior to the cross-examination of OPDclient/witness.” It asserts that if a motion to withdraw had been made at the time of the concurrent representation, it should have been granted. In its response to OPD’s amicus brief, Respondent argues that, “[n]otwithstanding OPDcounsel’s assertion, the ‘timing of the motion’ must matter because a courtcannot be expected to act until the matter is brought to the attention of thecourt or a disqualifying conflict of interest is readily apparent from theproceedings.” Respondent is correct insofar as the potential for conflict inthis case was resolved as indicated. Moreover, as Respondent correctlystated, many conflicts may be avoided if OPD follows the advice of the ICA,which “emphasize[d] the importance of having effective procedures in place totimely identify potential conflicts before representation is undertaken.”(Citing Mark, 120 Hawai' i at 536 n.27, 210 P.3d at 59 n.27). 
78
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5.
 
Although the ICA did not gravely err in its conclusion 
that the court’s decision was not an abuse of discretion, it is 
necessary to correct the ICA’s opinion, inasmuch as it based its decision in part on its conclusion that there was no “adverse effect on [counsel’s] actual performance at trial[,]” Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 535, 210 P.3d at 58, thereby indicating that the 
effect on counsel’s performance is a necessary consideration, even in cases where no consent has been given as in this case. Such a view represents an unwarranted departure from Richie. 
As stated supra, Richie held that representation is 
constitutionally ineffective where there exists “(1) a relationship giving rise to a conflict of interest . . . between defense counsel and his/her clients; and (2) either the relationship adversely affected defense counsel’s performance, or the client did not consent to the relationship.” Richie, 88 
Hawai
'i at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252 (emphases added). Thus, where no 
consent is given, the defendant need not show any adverse affect on counsel’s performance. 
Petitioner claims that “it is undisputed that neither
 
[Petitioner] nor Piko consented to any conflict of interest.” 
Respondent does not dispute this claim. Under Richie, absent
 consent, the only remaining question as to whether counsel was
 ineffective is whether there was a “relationship giving rise to a
 conflict[,]” regardless of counsel’s actual performance. See id. 
79
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Moreover, Richie emphasized that no showing of “actual prejudice”
 
is required, i.e., a showing that there is a reasonable
 possibility that the result of the proceeding might have been
 different. Id. at 42, 960 P.2d at 1250. In that regard, Richie
 
adopted the rationale of the federal courts that “proof of actual
 prejudice is not required because ‘prejudice is presumed when
 counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.’” Id. at
 
42-43, 960 P.2d at 1250-51 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466
 U.S. 668, 692 (1984)).
 
In spite of the holding in Richie, the ICA based its
 
decision in part on its determination that
 
there is nothing in the record establishing that there was
any adverse effect on [Loy’s] actual performance at trial.
She cross-examined Piko regarding his prior forgery
conviction, his probation status and his prior assault
convictions. Piko admitted that he had made what could be
 interpreted as a threatening comment to [Petitioner] and
that he had a temper (thus supporting [Petitioner’s]
self-defense theory), and that he thought he had a deal when
he testified in the first trial (thus impeaching his
credibility and establishing the basis for the motion that
is the subject of section IV.G.1., [of the ICA’s opinion]).
Finally, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the
charges related to Piko, and the circuit court dismissed the
charges after trial.
Courts that have found no conflict of interest in
 
former representation cases have emphasized that there was
no adverse effect on the performance of counsel. . . .
In sum, we conclude that the circuit court correctly
analyzed [Petitioner’s] motions under Rule 1.9, and did not
abuse its discretion in denying the motions.
 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 535, 210 P.3d at 58 (emphases added) 
(citation omitted). 
Although the observations made by the ICA are pertinent
 
inasmuch as they reflect and support the conclusion that no
 
conflict existed, they are misleading to the degree that they
 
80
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
indicate that a showing of an “adverse effect” or “actual
 
prejudice” might be necessary, even where no consent has been
 given. Thus, it must be reiterated that Richie held that, at
 least where no consent has been given, no showing of adverse
 effect is necessary, and there is no requirement that prejudice
 be demonstrated under any circumstances. 
E.
 
Underlying the question of whether a conflict existed
 
is the question of whether OPD should be treated as a single law
 firm for purposes of this analysis, or as a government office. 
In that regard, HRPC Rule 1.10(a) provides in part that “[w]hile
 lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly
 represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be
 prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7[ or] 1.9[.]” However, with
 regard to government offices, HRPC Rule 1.10(d) provides for an
 exception that “[t]he disqualifications of Rules 1.7, 1.9(a),
 [or] 1.9(b) . . . shall not be imputed to government lawyers
 provided the disqualified government lawyer has been screened
 from participation in the matter.”
 
With respect to this question, the ICA stated that
 
Rule 1.10(d) suggests the existence of a threshold question,
i.e., whether the OPD should be considered a single law firmfor the purposes of this analysis. See State v. Pitt, 77 
Hawai'i 374, 380, 884 P.2d 1150, 1156 (App. 1994) (adopting
a “case-by-case approach” to determine whether or not toapply the “private firm principle” of HRPC 1.10 togovernment offices). However, in view of our application ofRules 1.7 and 1.9 to the circumstances of this case, we neednot resolve that question, and we will assume arguendo thatOPD was one “firm” within the meaning of HRPC Rule 1.10. 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 532, 210 P.3d at 55 (emphasis added). Thus, 
81
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the ICA did not directly address the Rule 1.10 question, because
 
it determined that, under the circumstances of this case, the
 situation was not such that “one of them practicing alone would
 be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 [or] 1.9[,]” see HRPC
 Rule 1.10, and thus, Rule 1.10 was not implicated. 
However, as indicated before, Petitioner takes issue
 
with the ICA’s failure to “directly address[ Petitioner’s]
 assertion that, if a public defender’s office is to be treated as
 a private law firm rather than a government office, then there
 should be an imputed disqualification for all the attorneys in
 the office.” Petitioner’s contention apparently stems from his
 disagreement with the ICA’s conclusion that no conflict existed,
 thereby making it irrelevant in this case whether Burks, Loy, and
 Marshall were part of one firm. But because there was no
 relationship giving rise to a conflict under the rules, it would
 make no difference whether Piko and Petitioner were represented
 by attorneys within the same firm, as opposed to a single
 attorney. 
Petitioner’s argument seems to be that OPD’s status as
 
a “single law firm” rendered its representation of Piko a matter
 of “concurrent” rather than “prior” representation, because his
 attorneys retained access to Piko’s files. In that regard,
 Petitioner argues that
 
[t]he OPD did not close and lock up Piko’s case file. [Ho]
testified that, within the OPD, there was “free sharing of
information.” There was no China Wall in place. There was
 no screening procedure to prevent [DPDs] from discussing
client confidences with other [DPDs]. Attorneys were free
 
82
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to go to the file room and retrieve any file, even those
that were closed.
 
Piko’s file was not closed forever and could be
 
reopened at any time. The OPD more properly characterized
it as “inactive,” rather than “closed.” Since Piko was
 still on probationary status, his case could be called up at
any time -- as indeed it was.
There was an inherent conflict of interest. The
 
[DPDs’] duty to zealously represent [Petitioner] would have
required them to dig for any impeachable evidence on Piko,
including those in their own files. This also ties in with
 [OPD’s] position that [it] should be treated as a single law
firm. The fact that OPD supposedly did not discover this
conflict until July of 2004 would indicate that [it] placed
Piko’s confidentiality above [Petitioner’s] need for the
evidence.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
Under Petitioner’s formulation, because OPD should be
 
treated as “a single law firm,” due to, inter alia, the “free
 
sharing of information” therein, no OPD attorney could ever
 subsequently represent a client having adverse interests to a
 former client albeit in an unrelated matter, because the former
 client’s confidential information from the prior unrelated case
 might continue to be accessible.
40 However, such an analysis
 
would render HRPC Rule 1.9 a nullity, inasmuch as, as discussed
 supra, the rule explicitly allows subsequent representation of a
 different client having interests adverse to a former client
 under certain circumstances, not only by the same law firm, but
 by the same attorney. 
The same attorney will presumably always have access to
 
the files and information regarding a former client, and HRPC
 
40
 Moreover, under Petitioner’s view, subsequent representation would
always be inappropriate, regardless of whether the matters were related,
because the attorney would be obligated to use any information obtained in the
prior representation to the subsequent client’s advantage, regardless of the
impact on the former client. Such an interpretation conflicts with Rule 1.9.
 
83
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Rule 1.9 acknowledges as much, thereby prohibiting “[a] lawyer
 
who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose
 present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a
 matter [from] us[ing] information relating to the representation
 to the disadvantage of the former client . . . or
 reveal[ing] information relating to the representation[.]” HRPC
 Rule 1.9(c). As discussed above, the Commentary to Rule 1.9
 
addresses how the degree of “access” plays into a determination
 
of whether confidentiality will be respected. As stated supra,
 
the court’s findings on this issue indicate that such access was
 limited in this particular case.
41
 
Because the ICA’s conclusion that no conflict was 
present in this case should be affirmed, the question of whether OPD acted as “a single firm” for purposes of this case need not be addressed. However, it should be noted that the ICA has previously concluded that such a determination should be made on a case-by-case basis. See Pitt, 77 Hawai
'i at 380, 884 P.2d at 
1156 (“We agree that the case-by-case approach should be used to analyze whether a defendant represented by a deputy public 
41
 Although, technically, if OPD is considered a single law firm for
purposes of this case, “access” would hypothetically be unfettered, inasmuch
as all of the confidential information gained during Piko’s representation
would be imputed to Loy and Marshall. However, the question of access is
still relevant, inasmuch as limited access ensures that the confidentiality
aspect of Rule 1.9 will not be violated. Because Rule 1.9 does not absolutely
prohibit a single attorney from subsequently representing a client whose
interests are in some respect adverse to those of a former client, so long as
the matters are not substantially related, and confidentiality is preserved,
“access” alone cannot be the determinative factor, because a single attorney
presumably always will have some sort of “access” to the information he or she
obtained in the previous representation.
 
84
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
defender was denied his or her right to effective assistance of
 
counsel because of a prejudicial conflict of interest on the part
 of his or her attorney.”).
42 Pitt agreed with the approach set
 
forth by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland 
that under the case-by-case approach, if attorneys employed
by a public defender are required to “practice their
profession side by side, literally and figuratively,” they
are considered members of a “firm” for purposes of conflict
of interest analysis regarding representation of multiple
defendants, but where the practice of the attorneys in the
office is so separated that the interchange of confidential
information can be avoided or where it is possible to create
such separation, the office is not equated with a firm and
no inherent ethical bar would be present to the office’s
representation of antagonistic interests.
 
Id. at 380, 884 P.2d at 1156 (quoting Graves v. State, 619 A.2d
 
123, 133 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1993)) (emphasis added). The Pitt
 court determined that 
[u]nder this approach a trial court is required to conduct
an evidentiary hearing to:
1. determine whether attorneys employed by the same
public defender’s office can be considered the same as
private attorneys associated in the same law firm;
2. weigh factors relating to the protection of
confidential information by considering whether there are
separate offices, facilities and personnel; and
3. determine whether, as a consequence of having
access to confidential information, [a deputy] public
defender refrained from effectively representing a
defendant.
 
Id. (quoting Graves, 619 A.2d at 134) (emphases added). 
Consequently, it is worth observing that the court’s findings
 relating to “factors relating to the protection of confidential
 information” seem to indicate that information from Piko’s file
 
42
 Any reference to a “prejudic[e]” requirement in Pitt has been
 
overruled by Richie.
 
85
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was not revealed at any point to Loy or Marshall.43 See id. 
Although the Amicus brief relies heavily on Pitt, it 
should be noted that the third prong of the Pitt test, “whether, 
as a consequence of having access to confidential information, [a deputy] public defender refrained from effectively representing a defendant[,]” id., has been overruled by Richie. As discussed previously, Richie held “that defense counsel's representation is constitutionally ineffective under the Hawai
'i Constitution if: 
(1) a relationship giving rise to a conflict of interest existed between defense counsel and his/her clients; and (2) either the relationship adversely affected defense counsel's performance, or the client did not consent to the relationship.” Richie, 88 
Hawai
'i at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252. Richie only requires a conflict 
and a lack of consent as to the conflict. Whether a DPD “refrained from effectively representing a defendant” because of possession of confidential information is no longer the determinative factor. 
Furthermore, even if Pitt were controlling, OPD did not
 
satisfy the third prong of the Pitt test. OPD states that Loy
 had access to information contained in Piko’s confidential file, 
43
 As to the first prong of the Pitt test, OPD declares that it 
weighs in favor of finding a conflict of interest in that the OPD was more
akin to “private attorneys associated in the same law firm” than a governmentlaw firm. (Citing Pitt, 77 Hawai' i at 380, 844 P.2d at 1156.) However, as
explained above, Pitt is no longer controlling law. Furthermore, even if itwere controlling, the ICA assumed, as does this opinion, that OPD is a privatefirm for the purposes of this analysis. Mark, 120 Hawai' i at 532, 210 P.3d at
55. 
86
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
but refrained from using it to impeach or cross examine him 
because of her duty to Piko. OPD asserts that this duty to refrain from using confidential information interfered with her duty to effectively represent Petitioner. However, nothing indicates that as a result of her being able to access information, she “refrained from effectively representing defendant.” Pitt, 77 Hawai
'i at 380, 884 P.2 at 1156. 
Respondent correctly asserts that Loy would have a duty to refrain from using confidential information to impeach Piko pursuant to HRPC Rule 1.9, regardless of whether such information was readily available. HRPC Rule 1.9(c)(1) expressly prohibits the “use [of] information relating to the [prior] representation to the disadvantage of the former client[.]” Thus, Loy was required to refrain from using confidential information, were she privy to any. The argument that her failure to use that information, an act prohibited by the HRPC, would result in divided loyalties between Petitioner and Piko, creates a conflict where none is present. As such, even under the Pitt test, OPD’s argument is not persuasive. 
F.
 
Although the foregoing analysis addresses most of the
 
arguments raised in OPD’s Amicus brief, OPD does make three other
 points in arguing that the ICA’s decision adversely affected its
 interests. The first point is that “[i]f representation does
 officially end when the file has been closed [], deputy public
 
87
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
defenders will not only be relieved of its [sic] obligation to
 
assist their clients[,] but will no longer have the legal
 authority to assist [p]robationers.” In addressing OPD’s
 assertion, Respondent notes, first, that the file is sealed and
 when a defendant is sentenced, “no further proceedings are
 scheduled[.]” Respondent states that nothing in the record
 alleges that Piko actually contacted the OPD after being
 resentenced or that other individuals do the same. Moreover, OPD
 provides no apparent explanation as to why the ICA’s decision
 would prevent it from assisting probationers. Consequently,
 OPD’s argument on this point is unpersuasive. 
The second point is that the ICA’s holding puts Loy “in
 
an untenable position” inasmuch as her loyalties were divided
 while having to prepare for Petitioner’s case, and at the same
 time upholding OPD’s “ethical obligations to Piko.” The ethical
 obligations OPD refers to involves refraining from using Piko’s
 confidential information. OPD’s basic assertion is that, by
 obeying the prohibition that Loy not use the confidential
 information in Piko’s file against him, Loy demonstrated that her
 loyalties were divided between Petitioner and Piko and, thus, she
 was not able to adequately represent Petitioner. 
As previously noted, HRPC Rule 1.9(c)(1) states that a
 
lawyer shall not “use information relating to the [prior]
 representation to the disadvantage of the former client.” The
 rules manifestly contemplate that there may arise instances in
 
88
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
which a lawyer has confidential information that was obtained
 
through prior representation; and although the use of that
 information is prohibited, the rules do not categorically
 prohibit representation of a current client whose interests are
 adverse to those of the former client, provided it is not in the
 “same or a substantially related matter[.]” HRPC Rule 1.9(a). 
As Respondent explains, in the instant case, the DPD’s “refusal
 to engage in unethical conduct or conduct prohibited by law does
 not place counsel in an unethical dilemma or a situation of
 ‘divided loyalty.’” Thus, OPD’s argument on this point is also
 unpersuasive. 
OPD’s final point that “distrust by the client will
 
likely occur if the client is aware that the [DPD] or another
 [DPD] is representing or has represented the hostile party or
 witness” merits discussion. However, this contention is not
 sufficient to justify a per se rule disqualifying any DPD from
 serving as counsel in such cases.
 
There are two primary reasons why a per se rule
 
imputing conflicts of interest to all lawyers working at the
 public defender’s office must be rejected. The first advanced by
 some courts is that the same economic incentives that motivate
 private firms are not present at OPD. As one court stated,
 
[p]ublic interest firms have no financial incentive in
retaining the cases of joint defendants who might thereby be
prejudiced. As a consequence, the public does not lose
confidence in a rule allowing attorneys in the same office
to represent joint defendants, even though a single attorney
from that office could not handle the cases. Because the
 
primary, if not the only, responsibility of an assistant
 
89
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
public defender is to represent individual citizens in
controversy with the State . . . we can expect the public
defenders to withdraw from the case whenever joint
representation may prejudice their clients.
 
State v. Cook, 171 P.3d 1282, 1291 (Idaho Ct. App. 2007) (citing
 
State v. Bell, 447 A.2d 525, 528 (N.J. 1982)) (internal quotation
 marks omitted). Thus, the absence of a profit motive for
 representation should restore, at least in part, confidence in a
 DPD’s ability to adequately represent a party. 
The second reason is that a per se rule would result in
 
many defendants having to go without the expert representation
 provided by public defenders. As the Illinois Supreme Court
 noted:
 
In many instances the application of such a per se rule
would require the appointment of counsel with virtually no
experience in the trial of criminal matters, thus raising,
with justification, the question of competency of counsel.
Balanced against this is the possibility, in most instances
quite remote, that an experienced member of the public
defender's staff might labor under a conflict of interest
because another member of the staff was so burdened.
 
People v. Robinson, 402 N.E.2d 157, 162 (Ill. 1979). These two
 
considerations outweigh any possible chilling effect on attorney
 client relationships at OPD. See also, Bolin v. State, 137 P.3d
 
136, 145 (Wyo. 2006) (stating that, although conflicts involving
 associates at a private firm are imputed to entire firm, public
 defenders office “warrants slightly different treatment[,]” and
 adopting a case by case analysis); cf. People v. Daniels, 802 P.2d
 906, 915 (Cal. 1990) (holding that public defender did not face
 conflict requiring withdrawal when, bringing collateral attack of
 a defendant’s conviction, public defender was required to attack
 
90
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
competence of previous public defender, and stating that
 
“automatic disqualification . . . would hamper the ability of
 public defenders’ offices to represent indigents in criminal
 cases”); People v. Banks, 520 N.E.2d 617, 620 (Ill. 1987)
 (declining to “presume that public defenders would allow any
 office allegiances to interfere with their foremost obligation to
 their clients”). Hence, we decline to adopt a per se rule
 imposing disqualification on a DPD absent the development of an
 actual conflict. 
VI.
 
A.
 1.
 
In regard to his third question, Petitioner argues that
 
“[t]he cumulative effect from all the pre-trial publicity combined
 with the jury taint and prosecutorial misconduct denied
 [Petitioner] of [sic] his right to a fair trial.” Petitioner does
 not identify whether he was denied his right to a fair trial in
 his first trial, his second trial, or both. However, based on his
 reference to publicity, “jury taint” and “prosecutorial
 misconduct” noted above, it appears Petitioner is referring to his
 first trial.
44
 
Petitioner asserts that (1) due to the fact that he was
 
not convicted of murder in the first degree, “the prosecution
 
44
 These were arguments made by Petitioner in his Opening Brief
regarding the deprivation of his right to a fair trial in his first trial. 
91
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
failed to prove that [Petitioner] was aware that [Officer] Gaspar
 
was a law enforcement officer[,]” therefore (2) “it was a scenario
 where [Petitioner] was being manhandled by three strangers[,]”
 making “self-defense [] clearly applicable[,] . . . yet[ (3) the
 jury] convicted [Petitioner] of murder in the second degree.” 
According to Petitioner, “this was a result of the prejudicial
 pretrial publicity combined with jury taint and the prosecutor’s
 improper inflammatory questions.” 
2.
 
Respondent argues that “Petitioner does not appear to
 
challenge directly the ICA’s assessment of each error as having no
 merit” and that “the fact that the ICA found no merit to any
 single error and affirmed Petitioner’s convictions certainly
 suggests the [ICA] found no cumulative effect so prejudicial as to
 deny Petitioner a fair trial.” Respondent presents no other
 arguments on this issue.
 
3.
 
In regard to Petitioner’s first trial, the ICA held that 
because “the individual instances of error alleged by [Petitioner] are without merit, we need not address their alleged cumulative effect. Mark, 120 Hawai
'i at 518, 210 P.3d at 41. As to pre­
trial publicity, the ICA concluded that “the court’s thorough voir dire of potential jurors,” as well as “its repeated instructions to the jurors about avoiding exposure to media coverage and its questions to the jury confirming that they had not been exposed to 
92
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
such coverage as the case progressed, adequately protected
 
[Petitioner] from the potentially prejudicial effects of the
 extensive publicity that this case received.” Id. at 520-21, 210
 
P.3d at 43-44.
 
Petitioner’s allegation of “jury taint” involved an
 
incident prior to voir dire where potential jurors had seen a
 sheriff standing “a couple of feet” behind Petitioner and, thus,
 could have inferred that he “was in custody and was accordingly
 dangerous.” Id. at 521, 210 P.3d at 44. The ICA held that “[t]he
 
court was able, through its voir dire, to identify and excuse
 those potential jurors who were affected by their observations.” 
Id. Petitioner’s claim regarding “prosecutorial misconduct”
 
related to allegedly improper questioning of Petitioner and
 another witness by the prosecutor. The ICA concluded that the
 prosecutor “appeared to have a good faith basis for asking the
 challenged questions” and that “[a]lthough some of the questions
 could be interpreted as suggesting an improper inference, and the
 objections were sustained on that ground, those questions were
 ambiguous and thus did not prejudice [Petitioner], particularly
 given the court's prompt curative measures.” Id. (internal
 
citation omitted).
 
B. 
Other than alleging that there was “prejudicial pre­
trial publicity,” “jury taint,” and “prosecutorial misconduct,” 
Petitioner does not identify any particular error committed by the
 
93
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court. He points to no facts which would support such 
allegations, and makes no discernible argument in his Application related to why the pre-trial publicity was prejudicial, how the jury was tainted, or how the prosecutor committed misconduct. Indeed, Petitioner appears to concede that each of these alleged “error[s] standing alone may be harmless[.]” Therefore, any apparent claim by Petitioner that the alleged errors noted above occurred may be disregarded. See Norton v. Admin. Dir. of Court, 
80 Hawai
'i 197, 200, 908 P.2d 545, 548 (1995) (stating that the 
defendant “ma[de] no discernible argument in support of [his] position, . . . [and w]e may therefore disregard this particular contention”) (citation omitted). 
As noted above, Petitioner argues that “[i]n this case,
 
the cumulative effect was clearly prejudicial” because “the
 prosecution failed to prove that [Petitioner] was aware that
 [Officer] Gaspar was a law enforcement officer,” and “[i]f that
 was the case, then it was a scenario where he was being manhandled
 by three strangers[.]” According to Petitioner, “self-defense was
 clearly applicable[, a]nd yet, [the jury] convicted [Petitioner]
 of murder in the second degree[,]” which “was a result of” the
 alleged trial errors discussed above. 
However, the fact that the jury convicted Petitioner of
 
the lesser included offense of murder in the second degree of
 Officer Gaspar, rather than murder in the first degree, does not
 demonstrate that Petitioner was denied his right to a fair trial. 
94
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
At trial, the court instructed the jury on the offense of murder
 
in the first degree in regard to Officer Gaspar. In Jury
 Instruction No. 3, the court instructed the jury on the offense of
 murder in the second degree, which read as follows:
 
if and only if you unanimously find the prosecution has not
proven beyond a reasonable doubt all of the material elements
of Murder in the First Degree, or you are not unanimous as to
whether the prosecution has proven all of the material
elements of Murder in the First Degree beyond a reasonable
doubt, then you must consider whether the Defendant is guilty
or not guilty of the included offense of Murder in the Second
Degree.
 
The court then listed the material elements of the offense of
 
45
murder in the second degree :
A person commits the offense of Murder on the Second
Degree if he intentionally or knowingly causes the death of
another person.
There are two material elements of the offense of
 
Murder in the Second Degree, each of which, the prosecution
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
These two elements are:
 1. That, on or about the 4th day of March, 2003, in
the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii,
[Petitioner] caused the death of [Gaspar]; and
2. That [Petitioner] did so intentionally or
knowingly.
 
The court also instructed the jury on self-defense, stating that 
if you unanimously find that the prosecution has proven
beyond a reasonable doubt all of the material elements of
Murder in the First Degree, or of the included offense of
Murder in the Second Degree, . . . then you must consider
whether the force used by Defendant was justifiable based
upon self-defense.
 
The court then explained the defense, and listed its elements:
 
Justifiable use of force or deadly force based upon
self-defense is a defense to the offenses of Murder in the
 First Degree, Murder in the Second Degree, and Manslaughter
based upon reckless conduct. The burden is on the 
45
 Although Petitioner objected to this instruction, apparently on
the basis that it “fail[ed] to include justification[,]” Petitioner did not
raise this instruction as a point of error on appeal, nor does he argue it was
erroneous in his Application.
 
95
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the force
used by [Petitioner] was not justifiable based upon self-
defense. . . .
 
The use of force upon or toward another person is
justified when a person reasonably believes that such force
is immediately necessary to protect himself on the present
occasion against the use of unlawful force by the other
 person. The reasonableness of [Petitioner’s] belief that the
use of such protective force was immediately necessary shall
be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in
[Petitioner’s] position under the circumstances of which
[Petitioner] was aware or as [Petitioner] reasonably believed
them to be.
 
The use of deadly force upon or toward another person
is justified when a person using such force reasonably
believes that deadly force is immediately necessary to
protect himself in the present occasion against death,
serious bodily injury, or kidnapping. The reasonableness of
 [Petitioner’s] belief that the use of such protective force
was immediately necessary shall be determined from the
viewpoint of a reasonable person in [Petitioner’s] position
under the circumstances of which [Petitioner] was aware or as
[Petitioner] reasonably believed them to be.
The use of force is not justifiable to resist an arrest
which the actor knows is being made by a law enforcement
officer, although the arrest is unlawful. On the other hand,
if the law enforcement officer threatens to use or uses
 unlawful force, the law regarding use of protective force
would apply.
The use of deadly force is not justifiable if
[Petitioner], with the intent of causing death or serious
bodily injury, provoked the use if force against himself in
the same encounter, ir if [Petitioner] knows that he can
avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety
by retreating or by complying with a demand that he abstain
from any action which he has no duty to take.
If and only if you find that [Petitioner] was reckless
in having a belief that he was justified in using self-
protective force against another person, or that [Petitioner]
was reckless in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge
or belief which was material to the justifiability of his use
of force against the other person, then the use of such self-
protective force is unavailable as a defense to the offense
of Manslaughter based upon reckless conduct.
 
Petitioner did not object to this instruction. 
In sum, the jury was properly instructed that second
 
degree murder was an included offense of first degree murder, and
 
that even if the jury found that the prosecution had proved the
 elements of second degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt, the
 jury still needed to consider whether Petitioner was entitled to 
96
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the defense of self-defense. Based on the jury’s verdict, the
 
jury obviously found that the prosecution had satisfied its burden
 of proving the elements of the offense of murder in the second
 degree, and that Petitioner was not justified in using the force
 involved in that offense. Beyond bare allegations, Petitioner
 offers no explanation for why the jury’s verdict “was a result of
 the prejudicial pretrial publicity combined with the jury taint
 and the prosecutor’s improper inflammatory questions.” Because
 (1) Petitioner has made no discernible argument in regard to any
 alleged errors committed by the court and (2) the jury was
 properly instructed on the offense of murder in the second degree
 and the defense of self-defense, Petitioner’s claim that he was
 denied his right to a fair trial is not meritorious. 
VII.
 
A.
 
Petitioner claims that “[i]f [his] case is remanded for 
resentencing it should be solely for non-extended term sentencing.” According to Petitioner, “he should be treated just the same as [the defendant in State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai
'i 
432, 434, 168 P.3d 562, 564 (2007), whose case was remanded for only non-extended term sentencing.” Petitioner contends that “[s]ince [his] case was pending appeal at the same time as Maugaotega, the same new rule should apply to all other ‘similarly situated’ defendants.” 
97
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
Respondent argues that Petitioner “ignores” State v. 
Jess, 117 Hawai 'i 381, 413, 184 P.3d 133, 165 (2008), which “is 
the controlling precedent the ICA was duty bound to follow.” 
According to Respondent, pursuant to Jess, the ICA “correctly . . . determined that resentencing a criminal defendant under Act 1 is not unconstitutional and also authorizes a circuit court to resentence the defendant under a judicially reformed version of the prior statute governing extended term sentencing.” 
C. 
The ICA discussed the relevant history of Hawaii’s
 
extended sentencing scheme as follows:
 
After the decision in Maugaotega, the legislature
amended HRS §§ 706-661, -662, and -664 to require that a
jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to ajury determination, find the facts necessary to impose anextended term of imprisonment beyond a reasonable doubt.2007 Haw. Sess. L., 2d Spec. Sess., Act 1, § 2-4. Those amendments applied retroactively, id. at § 1, and providethat “[a] defendant whose extended term of imprisonment isset aside or invalidated shall be resentenced pursuant tothis Act upon the request of the prosecutor[,]” id. at § 5;see [Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 413, 184 P.3d at 165] (determining
that Act 1 is not unconstitutional). 
Mark, 120 Hawai 'i at 538-39, 210 P.3d at 61-62 (some brackets in 
original and some added). The ICA held that Petitioner’s extended 
sentences, which were based on findings made by the court, rather than a jury, were “unconstitutional under Maugaotega.” Id. at 
539, 210 P.3d at 62. On remand, [Respondent] may request that [Petitioner] be resentenced to extended terms in accordance with Act 1, or may request the imposition of non-extended sentences.” Id. 
98
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
D.
 
As concluded by the ICA, and conceded by Respondent,
 
Petitioner’s extended sentences violated his constitutional right
to trial by jury. The ICA was correct to conclude that, pursuant
to the opinion of a majority of this court in Jess, on remand, thecourt has the discretion to empanel a jury for purposes of
 resentencing on the extended term sentence.
46 In Jess, a majority
of this court determined that “[t]he circuit court would not
 offend the right to due process by reforming HRS § 706-662 (Supp.
1996)[ 
47
] so as to allow for jury consideration of the necessity
finding and applying that reformation to the case at hand.” 117
 Hawai
'i at 388, 184 P.3d at 140. Jess recognized that,  
 
 

 
 
46 Like Petitioner, “Jess’ case was pending on appellate review at
the time Maugaotega [] was decided[.]” Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 419, 184 P.3d at
171 (Acoba, J., dissenting). 
47 At the time Jess was sentenced, HRS § 706-662 provided, in
relevant part, that
 
[a] convicted defendant may be subject to an extended term
of imprisonment under [HRS §] 706-661, if the convicted
defendant satisfies one or more of the following criteria:
(1)	 The defendant is a persistent offender whose
imprisonment for an extended term is necessary
for protection of the public. The court shall
 not make this finding unless the defendant has
previously been convicted of two felonies
committed at different times when the defendant
 was eighteen years of age or older. 
. . . . 
(4)	 The defendant is a multiple offender whose
criminal actions were so extensive that a
 sentence of imprisonment for an extended term is
necessary for the protection of the public. The
 court shall not make this finding unless:
(a)	 The defendant is being sentenced for two
or more felonies or is already under
sentence of imprisonment for felony[.]

Id. at 410, 184 P.3d at 162 (emphasis added) (ellipsis omitted). 
However, in Jess, the majority went on to decide that the circuit
 court could apply a judicially amended version of HRS § 706-662,
 and thereby empanel a jury to resentence a defendant whose appeal
 was pending at the time of Maugaotega II, because
 
[t]here has . . . been a recent seachange in the
legislature’s clearly expressed intent regarding the wisdom
of employing juries in the context of extended term
sentencing. The enactment of H.B. No. 2 . . . during the
recent special session provides this court with a fresh,
conclusive expression of legislative support for the use of
juries as the trier of fact with respect to extended term
sentencing fact-finding and allows us to conclude with
confidence, that empaneling a jury would closely effectuate
policy judgments clearly articulated by the legislature, and
that the legislature would prefer such a reformed version of
the statute to invalidation of the statute . . . . In light
of the recent legislation, invocation of the court’s inherent
authority in the instant matter would not unduly burden or
substantially interfere with the other branch’s exercise of
its power.
 
Id. at 412-13, 184 P.3d at 164-65 (quotation marks, citations,
 
brackets, footnote, and ellipsis omitted) (emphasis added).
 
It was further determined that “[t]he circuit court may,
 
with respect to a properly charged defendant, empanel a jury for
 determination of the necessary findings pursuant to the newly
 amended versions of HRS §§ 706-661, 706-662, and 706-664[,]”
 because “Act 1 of the 2007 Second Special Session . . . provides
 in relevant part that ‘this Act shall apply to all sentencing or
 resentencing proceedings pending on or commenced after the

effective date of this Act, whether the offense was committed
 
prior to, on, or after the effective date of this Act[,]’” and
 “that ‘a defendant whose extended term of imprisonment is set
 aside or invalidated shall be resentenced pursuant to this Act
 upon request of the prosecutor.’” Id. at 413, 184 P.3d at 165
 
(brackets omitted).
 
Respondent is correct, then, that under Jess, upon
 
remand, Respondent may move that Petitioner be sentenced to an
 extended term, either pursuant to a judicially amended version of
 the former version of the extended term sentencing statute under
 which he was previously sentenced, or pursuant to Act 1.
 
VIII.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the May 29, 2009 judgment of
 
the ICA affirming Petitioner’s convictions is affirmed, and his
 case is remanded for resentencing.
