STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
JOHN P. DUNBAR, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CR. NO. 04-1-0450(1))
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of John P. Dunbar’s October 17, 2011
 
letter to the Chief Justice, which is treated as a motion for
 
reconsideration of the February 9, 2007 order rejecting the
 application for a writ of certiorari, it appears that the motion
 for reconsideration is not authorized by HRAP 40.1(h) (“Neither
 acceptance nor rejection of an application for a writ of
 certiorari shall be subject to a motion for reconsideration in
 the supreme court. The rejection of an application for a writ of
 certiorari shall be final.”). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for 
reconsideration is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 15, 2011.
