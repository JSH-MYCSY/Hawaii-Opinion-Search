IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
CARRIE M. YONEMORI, Respondent.
 
(ODC 05-153-8305, 08-028-8671, 09-047-8770) 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 (By: 
Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
assigned by reason of vacancy) 
Upon consideration of the Disciplinary Board’s Report 
and Recommendation for the Disbarment of Respondent Carrie M. 
Yonemori and the record, it appears Respondent Yonemori failed to 
provide competent and diligent representation to three clients, 
failed to communicate with the three clients, and failed to 
cooperate in the investigation of the clients’ complaints. It 
further appears these failures violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 
1.5(b), 3.4(e), 8.1(b), 8.4(a), and 8.4(d) of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Professional Conduct, to the detriment of the clients and the profession. It further appears that the hearing officer 
recommended a 3 year suspension. This court has said “we will 
not hesitate to impose substantial sanctions on attorneys who neglect their clients’ cases,” but we “exercise caution and 
prudence in adopting the ultimate sanction of disbarment,” Office 
of Disciplinary Counsel v. Kagawa, 63 Haw. 150, 159, 622 P.2d 
115, 121 (1981). Such caution is warranted here. It finally 
appears from the evidence in the record that Respondent Yonemori 
has no current clients and delaying the effective date of this 
order as provided by Rule 2.16(c) of the Rules of the Supreme 
Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH) would serve no purpose. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Yonemori is
 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for a
 
period of three (3) years, effective upon entry of this order.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in addition to any other
 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by our Rules, Respondent
 
Yonemori shall (1) pay costs of these proceedings, as approved
 
upon timely submission of a bill of costs, and (2) pay
 
restitution in the amount of $225 to Cynthia Shiroma.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Yonemori shall
 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, December 23, 2010.
