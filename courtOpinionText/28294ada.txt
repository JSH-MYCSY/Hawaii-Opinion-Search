At the time of the family court decree, Hawai #i Revised Statutes2
(HRS) section 571-2 defined “status offender,” as it does now, as 
any child coming within the family court’s jurisdiction
under section 571-11(2)(B), (C), or (D).  Such child is
distinguished from (A) a law violator under section
571-11(1) who comes into the family court upon allegations

OPINION OF THE COURT BY DUFFY, J.
On March 4, 2010, this court accepted petitioner/minor-
appellant NC’s (NC) timely application for writ of certiorari to
review the June 26, 2009 summary disposition order of the
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) in In re NC, No. 28294 (App.
June 26, 2009) (SDO), which affirmed the Family Court of the
Third Circuit’s (family court’s) September 26, 2006 decree1 which
adjudicated NC to be a status offender2 pursuant to Hawai# i   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

crime if committed by an adult, and (B) a neglected child
under section 571-11(2)(A) and (9) and chapter 587.
HRS § 571-2 (2006) (emphasis added).
2Revised Statutes (HRS) section 571-11(2) and placed NC on
protective supervision of the family court.
NC’s application presents the following question:
Whether the appellate court should recognize “plain
error” on appeal, as it did in Petitioner’s brother’s appeal
from the identical underlying act and point of error, as the
Family Court failed to engage in a Tachibana-like colloquy
to obtain an on-the-record waiver of the right to testify,
to remain silent, or to confront and cross-examine
witnesses.
We hold that the family court erred in proceeding under
HRS section 571-11(2) jurisdiction in this case based on the
material allegations of the amended petition filed against NC. 
NC’s substantial rights were violated when he was adjudicated for
alleged law violations without the statutorily required
recommendation of a qualified physician or psychologist, pursuant
to HRS section 571-44, and without the constitutional protections
that apply to proceedings conducted under HRS section 571-11(1)
jurisdiction.  As such, the family court’s adjudication of NC is
plain error and must be reversed.
I.   BACKGROUND
This case arises from alleged incidents of sexual
conduct between NC, a child who was between eight and nine years
old at the relevant times, and another child (CW), who was   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
At the time of the petition filed against NC, HRS section 707-3
732(1)(b) provided, as it does now:
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
third degree if:
. . . .
(b) The person knowingly subjects to sexual contact
another person who is less than fourteen years old or
causes such a person to have sexual contact with the
person[.]
HRS § 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2004).  “Sexual contact” was defined, as it is now,
as “any touching, other than acts of ‘sexual penetration’, of the sexual or
other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor, or of the sexual or
other intimate parts of the actor by the person, whether directly or through
(continued...)
3approximately seven years old at the relevant times.  What
follows are the facts and procedural history relevant to the
instant application.
A. The Petitions
On August 4, 2004, the Office of the Prosecuting
Attorney for the County of Hawai# i (prosecutor) filed a petition
in family court pursuant to HRS chapter 571.  The petition did
not indicate the section of chapter 571 under which it was filed;
however, the petition stated:
The above-named child appears to come within the purview of
the HRS Section indicated above, in that the child allegedly
violated or attempted to violate the law in the following
manner:
COUNT I []
Sometime between June 1, 2003, and October 23, 2003,
the exact date being unknown, in Kona, County and State of
Hawaii, [NC] knowingly subjected to sexual contact [CW], a
person who was less than fourteen years old, or caused [CW]
to have sexual contact with thereby [sic] committing the
offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation
of Section 707-732(1)(b),3 [HRS], as amended.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
(...continued)3
the clothing or other material intended to cover the sexual or other intimate
parts.”  HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2004).  “Sexual penetration” was defined, as
(1) Vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio, deviate
sexual intercourse, or any intrusion of any part of a
person’s body or of any object into the genital or anal
opening of another person’s body; it occurs upon any
penetration, however slight, but emission is not required;
or 
(2) Cunnilingus or anilingus, whether or not actual
penetration has occurred.

person who was less than fourteen years old, or caused [CW]
to have sexual contact with him, thereby committing the
offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation
of Section 707-732(1)(b), [HRS], as amended.
COUNT III []
Sometime between August, 2003, and September, 2003,
the exact date being unknown, in Kona County and State of
Hawaii, [NC] knowingly subjected to sexual contact [CW], a
person who was less than fourteen years old, or caused [CW]

Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of Section 707-
732(1)(b), [HRS], as amended.
(Emphases added.)  
Although the petition did not specify the section of
chapter 571 under which it had been filed, allegations that NC   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
5had committed an offense in violation of HRS section 707-
732(1)(b) were consistent with a petition filed pursuant to HRS
section 571-11(1) (1993 & Supp. 2004).  
At the time of the petition, HRS section 571-11(1)
provided, as it does now:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the court
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings:
(1) Concerning any person who is alleged to have
committed an act prior to achieving eighteen years of
age which would constitute a violation or attempted
violation of any federal, state, or local law or
municipal ordinance.  Regardless of where the
violation occurred, jurisdiction may be taken by the
court of the circuit where the person resides, is
living, or is found, or in which the offense is
alleged to have occurred[.]
HRS § 571-11(1) (emphasis added).
On September 29, 2004, the prosecutor amended the
petition against NC.  However, as with the original petition, the
amended petition did not indicate the section of HRS chapter 571
under which the petition had been filed.  The amended petition
stated the following:
The above-named child appears to come within the purview of
the HRS Section indicated above, in that the child allegedly
violated or attempted to violate the law in the following
manner:
The above-named child appears to come within the purview of

(Emphases added.)  
The amended petition retained the original petition’s
allegations that NC had committed offenses in violation of HRS
section 707-732(1)(b); however, it added language that appeared   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
HRS section 571-2 provided, as it does now, that:  “‘Child’ or4
‘minor’ means a person less than eighteen years of age.”  HRS § 571-2 (1993).
7to assert family court jurisdiction pursuant to HRS section 571-
11(2) (1993) and HRS section 571-44 (1993).
At the time of the petition, HRS section 571-11(2)
provided, as it does now:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the court
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings:
. . .
(2) Concerning any child[4] living or found within the
circuit: 
(A) Who is neglected as to or deprived of
educational services because of the failure of
any person or agency to exercise that degree of
care for which it is legally responsible; 
(B) Who is beyond the control of the child’s
parent or other custodian or whose behavior is
injurious to the child’s own or others’ welfare; 
(C) Who is neither attending school nor
receiving educational services required by law
whether through the child’s own misbehavior or
nonattendance or otherwise; or 
(D) Who is in violation of curfew[.]
HRS § 571-11(2).
HRS section 571-44 states the following requirements
before a child under the age of twelve can be adjudged to come
within HRS section 571-11(1):
The court may order that a child or minor concerning whom a
petition has been filed shall be examined by a physician,
surgeon, psychiatrist, or psychologist, and it may order
treatment, by them, of a child or minor who has been
adjudicated by the court.  For either the examination or
treatment, the court may place the child or minor in a
hospital or other suitable facility.  The court, after
hearing, may order examination by a physician, surgeon,   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
8psychiatrist, or psychologist, of a parent or guardian whose
ability to care for a child before the court is at issue.
No child under the age of twelve shall be adjudged to come
within section 571-11(1) without the written recommendation
of a licensed psychologist or of a psychiatrist or other
physician duly qualified by special training and experience
in the practice of child psychiatry.
HRS § 571-44 (emphasis added).
B. Pretrial Proceedings
On September 9, 2004, a summons was issued, pursuant to
HRS section 571-11(2), for NC and his parents to appear before
the family court on September 21, 2004.
On September 23, 2004, NC’s parents, through their
(parents’) counsel, filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that
“a minor less than fourteen years old cannot commit the offenses
charged.”  NC joined in the motion. 
On December 7, 2004, a hearing was held on the motion
to dismiss, and the family court orally denied the motion.  On
March 29, 2005, the family court filed a written order denying
the motion which stated that the motion was treated as a motion
filed by NC.  In the family court’s findings of fact and
conclusions of law, the family court concluded, inter alia, that
the sexual assault statutes at issue were “very specific and
precise and are not vague, arbitrary, or discriminatory,” and did
not violate NC’s due process rights.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
9The family court also concluded that “[b]ecause [NC]
was under the age of 12 years old at the time the alleged
offenses occurred, Minor can only be adjudicated as a status
offender pursuant to §571-11(2), H.R.S., as amended (also called
a person in need of supervision).  §571-44, H.R.S., as amended.” 
(Emphases added.)
On March 7, 2005, NC’s parents filed a motion for
reconsideration of the family court’s denial of the motion to
dismiss.  NC filed a joinder in the motion for reconsideration on
March 29, 2005.  The family court orally denied the motion on
April 19, 2005 and filed a written order on May 12, 2005.
On May 2, 2005, NC’s parents filed a motion for leave
to file an interlocutory appeal from the family court’s denial of
the motion to dismiss and denial of the motion for
reconsideration.  On May 20, 2005, NC filed a joinder in the
motion for interlocutory appeal.  The family court orally denied
the motion on May 24, 2005, and filed a written order on June 29,
2005. 
C. Stipulated Evidence
On October 4, 2005, the prosecutor and NC submitted a
stipulation regarding the submission of evidence for the bench
trial to the family court.  The stipulation incorporated by
reference the “Submission of Stipulated Evidence For Bench Trial,   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
10Exhibits ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’” filed with the family court in In re
TC, stating, in relevant part
WHEREAS, the police report(s), exhibits and other materials
in [In re TC], are the same police report(s), exhibits and
materials that relate to the allegations in the instant
case, [In re NC].  In other words, this material is relevant
evidence and will assist the Court in reaching a decision in
above-entitled case.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED that the
“Submission Of Stipulated Evidence For Bench Trial” filed on
or about August 25, 2005, in [In re TC], is hereby
incorporated by reference.  The police report(s), exhibits
and other materials shall be deemed as admissible evidence
for the above-entitled Court to consider in the instant
case, [In re NC].
The stipulation was signed by the prosecuting attorney, NC’s
counsel, and NC.
D. Adjudication of NC as a Status Offender
On October 4, 2005, the family court rendered its
decision and adjudicated NC to be a status offender.  Of
relevance to the instant application, the family court stated the
following, during the adjudication hearing:
The Court further understands that in both of these cases
involving [TC] and [NC], that the parties waive their right
to have an actual trial by presenting of live witnesses and
other evidence, and instead offer to the Court for its
consideration, evidence stipulated, which would include, but
certainly not limited to, the -- all the police reports
attached to as Exhibit B to the submission of stipulated
evidence for bench trial filed . . . on August 25, 2005, and
Dr. Peter In’s report submitted as Exhibit C attached to
that document referenced.  And that the minors did waive
their ability to cross-examine any of the evidence presented
by way of stipulation.
(Emphases added.)  The family court concluded that:
Based upon all of the evidence presented, the Court
further finds and concludes that the State has met its
burden in proving beyond a reasonable doubt each and every   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
11element of each count of the petitions, both of which were
filed on April 3, 2004 [sic].
The minors make no closing arguments with regards --
and the parents make no closing arguments with regards to
the contents contained in the exhibits that have been
received into evidence.  As the Court reviews the evidence
presented, in essence the minors have . . . admitted to the
allegations.
Dr. In’s letter, which is attached as Exhibit C, dated
January 16, 2004, indicates a general denial of the sexual
assault.  However, the evidence contained in the police
reports as stipulated into evidence shows completely
otherwise, particularly in light of the admissions.
Based upon the evidence as presented, the Court now
does adjudicate [TC] as a law violator and because of [NC’s]
age, he comes under the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant
to the provisions of person in need of supervision.  So
those would be the orders of the Court.
(Emphases added.)
E. Disposition
On September 26, 2006, NC’s disposition came on for
hearing and the family court filed a decree regarding a person in
need of supervision, stating:
After full consideration of the admitted evidence the
Court finds that the material allegations of the petition(s)
have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence and that
the minor is a status offender within the purview of HRS
Section 571-11(2).
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED the minor
be placed on protective supervision to the Family Court
until further order of the court with the following special
conditions:
1. That minor attends all classes on time with no
unexcused absences or tardies.
2. Minor shall attend counseling as deemed appropriate by
the contracted Juvenile Sex Offender Treatment
provider.  These sessions will require parental
participation and are in conjunction with therapy
sessions that involve the minor’s sibling.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
123. Minor shall not be left unsupervised or solitary with
any children under the age of 14.  Upon approval of
his therapist and probation officer, this condition
may be modified.
4. Minor shall be restricted from possession or using
sexually explicit media (pornography), female
undergarments; or sexually explicit (pornographic)
pictures of children.
5. Minor shall not be allowed out on his own,
unsupervised without the presence of a parent or other
responsible adult as designated by the therapist or
probation officer, until such time as it is determined
by the therapist or probation officer.
6. Minor shall have no contact with the victim or
victim’s family.
7. Minor shall contact his probation officer every other
week by telephone and report for a face-to-face
interview once a month until further directed by his
probation officer.
(Emphasis added.)
F. Motion for Reconsideration
On October 11, 2006, NC’s parents filed a motion for
reconsideration of the family court’s decree.  On October 24,
2006, the motion for reconsideration came on for hearing, and NC
joined in the motion for reconsideration.  NC did not add to the
arguments provided in NC’s parents’ motion for reconsideration. 
The family court orally denied the motion at the close of the
hearing.
On November 17, 2006, NC filed his notice of appeal
from the family court’s September 26, 2006 decree and its order
denying the motion for reconsideration.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
13On December 19, 2006, the family court filed written
findings of fact, conclusions of law and order denying the motion
for reconsideration, stating in relevant part:
FINDINGS OF FACT
1. A stipulated facts trial was held in this case between
August 26, 20/05 [sic] and October 4, 2005, when a
decision was rendered by the Court.
2. [NC] was born June 24, 1994, and thus was age 11 at
the time of the adjudication.
3. The allegations against [NC] was that [sic] sometime
between June 1, 2003 and October 23, 2003 (when [NC]
was between age 8 and age 9, [sic] he subjected [CW]
to sexual contact (4 counts).  [CW] was alleged to be
under the age of 14.  In fact he was born in April
1996 approximately two years younger than [NC], age 7
at the time of these incidents.
4. Based on the reports submitted, the court found that
the allegations were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
5. [NC] was found to be a person in need of supervision,
not a law violator, based on his age.
6. Also considered as part of the stipulated facts trial
was a January 16, 2004 letter from psychiatrist Peter
In, which discussed the allegation and recommended
long term therapy for [TC] and brief therapy for [NC].
7. The disposition ordered in this case included
counseling, but not incarceration.
8. The parents of [NC] moved to reconsider the findings
and rulings, arguing:
1)  That the parents have standing in the
child’s case;
2)  That the parents were entitled to question
Denis Gershick MA, CSAC and Claude McDowell Psy.
D, whose reports were considered at the
disposition;
3)  That the minors are victims or protected
class members and cannot be prosecuted;
4)  That HRS 571-11(1) cannot make noncriminal
behavior criminal and    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
145)  That finding the minor to be a law violator
as a juvenile violated due process because the
statute did not give a reasonable opportunity to
know what was prohibited;
6)  That the intent of HRS 707-730(1)(b) and
707-732(1)(b) is that the perpetrator be an
adult and;
7)  That the 2001 amendment to sexual assault
laws applying to complainants between the ages
of 14 and 16, and to perpetrators at least 5
years older than the complainant, should be
applied to this case were [sic] both the
complainant and the perpetrator were under the
age of 14, and
8)  That supervision of the minor was not
warranted;
9. Although the court ruled that the parents did not have
standing, each of the parents’ arguments has been
considered by the court because it was adopted by the
minor.  Therefore the issue of the parent’s [sic]
standing is moot.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1. The issue of the parent’s [sic] standing is moot as
the court has considered all arguments raised by the
parents and adopted by the minors.
2. Hearsay, including reports of experts such as
Gershick, McDowell and In, are generally admissible at
sentencing or disposition proceedings and were
properly considered in this proceeding.
3. There is nothing in the plain language of the statute
under which minor was adjudicated which specifies that
the perpetrator of the crime must be an adult, or that
he must be older than the alleged victim.
4. HRS 571-11(2) specifies that a minor may be
adjudicated under that section for any behavior
committed prior to the age of 18, which is injurious
to the welfare of the charged minor or to the welfare
of others.  Given the fact that the statutes
pertaining to sexual assault, which this minor is
alleged to have violated do not specify any minimum
age for the perpetrator, nor any age difference
between the complainant and perpetrator, the minor was
properly adjudicated under that section for behavior
committed prior to the age of 18 that would constitute
a violation of state law.  The court also finds that
[NC’s] behavior was injurious both to his own welfare
and to that of [CW].   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
155. The Hawaii statutes pertaining to sexual assault are
not so vague as to fail to give notice as to what is
prohibited.  Both sexual penetration and sexual
contact with a person under the age of 14 are
absolutely prohibited.
6. The court will not read into the statutes governing
sexual assault, a requirement not put in those
statutes by the legislature, i.e., that the person
accused must be an adult.  The legislature has shown
itself quite capable of inserting minimum age
differences by enacting subsection (c) of 707-730 and
707-732 pertaining to alleged victims between the ages
of 14 and 16.
7. The fact that the legislature recognized that there
might be sexual experimentation by minors between the
ages of 14 and 16, which should not be punished
criminally absent a 5 year age difference between the
parties, does not mean that the legislature deemed it
appropriate to allow sexual experimentation between
minors younger than age 14.  In this case there was an
age difference of two years between [NC] and [CW],
[CW] being approximately 7 years old at the time, the
significantly older [NC] engaged in sexual contact
with [CW] and subjected him to sexual penetration. 
Sexual experimentation of the type alleged and proven
is not appropriate for 7 year olds or 9 year olds.
8. Supervision by the court is appropriate in this case. 
Dr. In recommended short term therapy for [NC]. 
Dennis Gershick, Barbara Mullen and Claude McDowell
all recommended treatment for [NC], consisting
primarily of education about healthy sexual
relationships and boundaries.  According to their
evaluation treatment readiness for change was rated at
moderate risk because [NC] does not acknowledge that
he did anything wrong, and does not perceive a problem
or need to change.  According to the letter from the
father of [CW] he is very concerned about what he
perceives as [NC’s family’s] pervasive denial about
what occurred between the boys and unwillingness to
get help.  Accordingly, supervision of the minor is
warranted.
(Emphases added.)
G. Appeal to the ICA
On March 7, 2008, NC filed his opening brief with the
ICA alleging five points of error:  (1) The family court failed   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
16to establish that NC knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily
waived his constitutional rights in proceeding to trial on
stipulated evidence; (2) The family court erred in ruling that NC
and TC may be prosecuted as neither of them was a victim or part
of a protected class; (3) The family court erred in ruling that
HRS section 571-11(2) does not make noncriminal behavior criminal
by increasing the minor’s age; (4) The family court erred when it
ruled that HRS section 707-732(1)(b) as applied to minors under
the age of fourteen does not violate due process and equal
protection clauses of the Constitution; and (5) The family court
erred when it ruled that prosecuting minors less than fourteen
years old under HRS sections 707-732(1)(b) did not produce an
absurd and unjust result and that the statute did not require an
adult perpetrator. 
On June 26, 2009, the ICA filed its SDO in In re NC,
No. 28294, which affirmed the family court’s September 26, 2006
Decree.  SDO at 9.  Of relevance to the instant application, the
ICA resolved NC’s first point of error, alleging that the family
court failed to establish that NC knowingly, intelligently, and
voluntarily waived his constitutional rights in proceeding to
trial on stipulated evidence, as follows:
We decline to recognize plain error regarding NC’s
waiver of his “constitutional rights” associated with the
trial by stipulated evidence in this case.  In his points of
error, NC does not identify which particular constitutional
rights he now seeks to assert, nor does he identify which   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
HFCR Rule 61 provides:5
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of
evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in
anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the
parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting
aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise
disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such
action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial
justice.  The court at every stage of the proceeding must
disregard any error or defect in the proceeding that does
not affect the substantial rights of the parties.
HFCR Rule 61 (emphases added).
17constitution and/or constitutional provisions provide for
such rights.  NC makes no argument and cites no legal
authority in support of the requested relief.  Under these
circumstances, we decline to recognize plain error.  See
also Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
28(b)(7) (“Points not argued may be deemed waived.”).
Id. at 6 (emphasis in original).
On October 28, 2009, the ICA filed its judgment on
appeal.  On January 25, 2010, NC filed the instant application. 
The prosecutor did not file a response.
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
A. Plain Error
This court has previously stated that “[w]e may
recognize plain error when the error committed affects
substantial rights of the defendant.”  State v. Kamanao,  103
Hawai#i 315, 319-20, 82 P.3d 401, 405-06 (2003) (internal
quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Shinyama, 101 Hawai# i
389, 395, 69 P.3d 517, 523 (2003)); see also Hawai #i Family Court
Rules (HFCR) Rule 61 (2000);5 Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
18(HRPP) Rule 52(b) (1977) (“Plain errors or defects affecting
substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought
to the attention of the court.”  (Emphasis added.)).
B. Statutory Interpretation
It is well-settled that
“[t]he interpretation of a statute is a question of law
reviewable de novo.”  Capua v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 117 Hawai# i
439, 443, 184 P.3d 191, 196 (2008) (citing Flor v. Holguin,
94 Hawai# i 70, 76, 9 P.3d 382, 388 (2000)) (brackets,
citations, and ellipses omitted).  Statutory construction is
guided by the following rules:
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its
plain and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the
task of statutory construction is our foremost
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself.  Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
And fifth, in construing an ambiguous statute, the
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.

under the right/wrong standard and, thus, exercises its own
independent judgment based on the facts of the case.”  State v.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

III.  DISCUSSION
A. The ICA Did Not Err When It Deemed That NC’s Point of Error
Had Been Waived.
NC argues that the ICA gravely erred when it failed to
include HRS section 572-11(2) status offenders among the juvenile
defendants entitled to an on-the-record waiver of the right to
testify in their own behalf.  
As stated previously, the ICA cited HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)
and declined to recognize this point of error, because NC made no
argument and cited no legal authority in support of that point. 
SDO at 6.
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) provides that
[w]ithin 40 days after the filing of the record on appeal,
the appellant shall file an opening brief, containing the
following sections in the order here indicated:
. . . .
(7) The argument, containing the contentions of the
appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor,
with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the
record relied on.  The argument may be preceded by a concise
summary.  Points not argued may be deemed waived.
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (2008) (emphasis added).
A review of NC’s opening brief on appeal reveals that
NC included the point of error that “[t]he family court
reversibly erred in failing to establish that [NC] knowingly,   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
HRE Rule 103(d) provided, as it does now, that “[n]othing in this6
rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights
although they were not brought to the attention of the court.”  HRE Rule
103(d) (1993).
20intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights
to proceeding to trial on stipulated evidence.”  NC argued that
“[t]he family court failed to colloquy [NC] regarding the
relinquishment of the rights he waived by proceeding to trial in
this manner.” 
NC appeared to cite State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai #i 325,
330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998), as well as HRPP Rule 52(b) and
Hawai#i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 103(d),6 for the standard of
review for plain error.  NC then argued that “[t]he family
court’s failure to colloquy [NC] and to obtain a valid waiver of
his fundamental rights constituted reversible error.” 
The ICA was correct in stating that NC did not specify
which of his fundamental rights had been violated during his
adjudication as a status offender.  SDO at 6.  Also, NC did not
indicate which constitutional or fundamental rights had been
violated or which constitution provided those rights to status
offenders.  As a result, NC provided the “contentions” for this
point of error, but did not articulate the corresponding
“reasons” or provide the necessary “citations to the authorities
. . . relied on.”  HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
21Accordingly, the ICA did not err in deeming this point
of error waived for failure to provide argument as required by
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
B. The ICA Plainly Erred When It Did Not Recognize That NC’s
Adjudication As A Status Offender Violated His Statutory And
Constitutional Rights.
NC argues in his application that the ICA erred when it
declined to recognize as plain error the family court’s failure
to engage NC in a colloquy regarding the waiver of his right to
testify.  
For reasons discussed further herein, we conclude that
NC’s substantial rights were violated when he was adjudicated as
a status offender upon allegations that he violated a criminal
statute.  As such, the ICA plainly erred when it did not
recognize this violation of NC’s statutory and constitutional
rights.  See HRAP Rule 40.1 (“The supreme court, at its option,
may notice a plain error not presented.”); Kamanao, 103 Hawai #i
at 319-20, 82 P.3d at 405-06; HFCR Rule 61.  
1. HRS Section 571-11(2) Does Not Authorize Adjudications
Based Upon Alleged Violations of Law.
Of relevance to this discussion is how children’s cases
progress through family court pursuant to HRS chapter 571.  HRS
section 571-21 describes the initiation of a child’s case, in
relevant part, as follows:   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
22(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), whenever
the court is informed by any person that a minor is within
the purview of section 571-11(1) or (2), the intake officer
shall make a preliminary investigation to determine whether
informal adjustment is suitable under section 571-31.4 or
571-31.5.  The court may authorize the filing of a petition,
may make whatever arrangement for informal adjustment that
is suitable under section 571-31.4, 571-31.5, or 571-31.6;
or may take such action as is otherwise allowed under this
chapter.  Efforts to effect informal adjustment may be
continued not longer than three months without review by the
judge.
(b)  In cases of violation of a law or ordinance by a child,
the issuance of a citation or summons, when provided by law
or ordinance, shall be sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction
of the court, which may proceed to dispose of such a case
with or without preliminary investigation and the filing of
a petition.
HRS § 571-21(a)-(b) (2006) (emphases added).  Notably, the intake
officer must initiate a preliminary investigation “whenever the
court is informed by any person that a minor is within the
purview of section 571-11(1) or (2).”  Id. (emphasis added). 
This preliminary investigation may result in the intake officer
affording the minor with an opportunity for an informal voluntary
adjustment of behavior program or with the court authorizing the
filing of a formal petition for a formal proceeding under HRS
chapter 571.  Id.
“Informal adjustment” is defined as:
the effort by intake officers, the courts, or others to
provide a child referred to them or brought before them, and
where appropriate that child’s family, opportunity and aid
before and in lieu of formally processing the child under
this chapter.  The objective of this effort is to afford
opportunity and aid so that the child, and where appropriate
the child’s family, may realize voluntary adjustment of
behavior and obtain counseling and edification so as to
better allow the child’s appropriate emergence into adult
society.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
23HRS § 571-2 (2006) (emphases added).  As defined by HRS chapter
571, informal adjustment is a process that takes place prior to
and in place of formal proceedings under HRS chapter 571.  Id.  
Importantly, the objective of informal adjustment is to
realize “voluntary adjustment” of the child’s behavior.  Id.  The
voluntary nature of informal adjustment is further reflected in
the preconditions that must be satisfied before this substitute
for formal processing is available.  For a child reasonably
believed to come within the family court’s jurisdiction under HRS
section 571-11(1) or section 571-11(2) or both, informal
adjustment “may be provided to the child by an intake officer
duly authorized by the family court only where the facts
reasonably appear to establish prima facie jurisdiction and are
admitted and where a consent is obtained from the child’s parent,
guardian, or legal custodian, and the child, if of sufficient age
and understanding.”  HRS §§ 571-31.4(a), 571-31.5(a) (2006)
(emphasis added).  Therefore, children reasonably believed to be
status offenders, law violators, or both, may be allowed to avoid
a formal action if:  (1) the facts brought to the court’s
attention reasonably appear to establish prima facie
jurisdiction, (2) the child admits to those facts, (3) the
child’s parent, guardian, or legal custodian consents to informal   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
24adjustment, and (4) the child, if of sufficient age and
understanding, consents to informal adjustment.  See id.  
It is possible that facts revealed during a preliminary
investigation may “reasonably appear to establish prima facie
jurisdiction” under both HRS section 571-11(1) and HRS section
571-11(2).  See id.  In that case, HRS section 571-31.6 provides
that
[w]hen a child is reasonably believed to come within section
571-11(1) and (2), the intake officer may exercise
discretion to process informal adjustment under section 571-
31.4 or 571-31.5.  In making that determination, the officer
shall be guided by the criteria set out in section 571-
31.1(c)(1) to (5), taking into account the availability of
suitable method, program, or procedure for the child.
HRS § 571-31.6 (emphasis added).  
Regardless of which informal adjustment process is
selected by the intake officer, however, both HRS section 571-
31.4 and section 571-31.5 provide the following:
In the event resources and services for informal adjustment
are not available, have failed, are reasonably believed to
fail if attempted, or are unable to respond to the needs of
the child or family, the intake officer shall proceed with
formal action, or take such action as is otherwise allowed
under this chapter.
HRS §§ 571-31.4(d), 571-31.5(b) (emphasis added).  
a. formal actions in children’s cases
In formal actions, the procedure in children’s cases is
defined by HRS section 571-41.  See HRS § 571-41 (2006).  Unlike
informal adjustment, the focus of HRS section 571-41 is not
whether informally presented facts “reasonably appear to   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
25establish prima facie jurisdiction.”  See HRS  §§ 571-31.4(a),
571-31.5(a).  Rather, HRS section 571-41 focuses on the
allegations of a petition filed with the family court.  HRS
section 571-41(c) provides, in relevant part:
Findings of fact by the judge or district family judge
of the validity of the allegations in the petition shall be
based upon a preponderance of evidence admissible in the
trial of civil cases except for petitions alleging the
court’s jurisdiction under section 571-11(1) which shall
require proof beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with
rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases; provided
that no child who is before the court under section 571-
11(1) shall have admitted against the child any evidence in
violation of the child’s rights secured under the
constitution of the United States or the State of Hawaii.
HRS § 571-41(c) (emphasis added).  
As previously stated by this court, “[t]he family court
is a court of limited jurisdiction and, as such, derives its
authority from the statutes that created it.”  In re Doe, 96
Hawai#i 272, 284-85, 30 P.3d 878, 891 (2001) (citing Cleveland v.
Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 520, 559 P.2d 744, 746 (1977); In re Doe,
86 Hawai# i 517, 520, 950 P.2d 701, 704 (App. 1997)).  HRS chapter
571 provides the family court with jurisdiction over children
under specific circumstances defined by section 571-11.  Of
relevance to this case, section 571-11(1) and section 571-11(2)
provide separate bases for asserting family court jurisdiction
with distinct requirements defined by statute.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
26b.  section 571-11(1) jurisdiction
HRS section 571-11(1) provides the family court with
exclusive original jurisdiction for formal proceedings that
“[c]oncern[] any person who is alleged to have committed an act
prior to achieving eighteen years of age which would constitute a
violation or attempted violation of any federal, state, or local
law or municipal ordinance.”  HRS § 571-11(1).
Formal proceedings under HRS section 571-11(1) may be
initiated by a citation, summons, complaint, or petition alleging
a violation of law or ordinance by the child.  See HRS § 571-
21(a)-(d) (2006).   
c.  section 571-11(2) jurisdiction
By contrast, section 571-11(2) provides the family
court with exclusive original jurisdiction for formal proceedings
that 
[c]oncern[] any child living or found within the circuit: 
(A) Who is neglected as to or deprived of educational
services because of the failure of any person or agency to
exercise that degree of care for which it is legally
responsible; 
(B) Who is beyond the control of the child’s parent or other
custodian or whose behavior is injurious to the child’s own
or others’ welfare; 
(C) Who is neither attending school nor receiving
educational services required by law whether through the
child’s own misbehavior or nonattendance or otherwise; or 
(D) Who is in violation of curfew[.]
HRS § 571-11(2) (emphases added).     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
27Notably, section 571-11(2) does not include allegations
that a child has committed an act that would be considered a
violation of the law.  Further, HRS section 571-11(2) proceedings
are not initiated by a citation or summons alleging a violation
of the law.  See HRS § 571-21(a)-(d).  Moreover, HRS chapter 571
explicitly distinguishes between the allegations that provide the
family court with jurisdiction under section 571-11(1) and those
that provide jurisdiction under section 571-11(2) in the
following definition:
“[s]tatus offender” means any child coming within the family
court’s jurisdiction under section 571-11(2)(B), (C), or
(D).  Such child is distinguished from (A) a law violator
under section 571-11(1) who comes into the family court upon
allegations such person has committed an act which would
constitute a crime if committed by an adult, and (B) a
neglected child under section 571-11(2)(A) and (9) and
chapter 587.
HRS § 571-2 (emphasis added).  
Based on the definition of a “status offender” provided
by statute, a child who comes into the family court upon
allegations that he or she “has committed an act that would
constitute a crime if committed by an adult” does not come within
the family court’s jurisdiction under section 571-11(2).  Id. 
Indeed, research of Hawai #i case law does not reveal any
appellate court decision that considered a petition brought
solely under section 571-11(2) jurisdiction based on allegations
that a child had committed acts that would constitute a crime if   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
28committed by an adult.  See, e.g., In re Doe, 84 Hawai #i 41, 43,
928 P.2d 883, 885 (1996) (considering a petition filed under HRS
section 571-11(2)(B) that alleged the child was beyond the
control of her parents when she left home without permission); In
re Doe, 96 Hawai# i 73, 75-77, 26 P.3d 562, 564-66 (2001)
(considering a petition filed under HRS section 571-11(2)(C) that
alleged forty-nine days of unexcused absences and a separate
petition filed under HRS section 571-11(1) alleging criminal
contempt of court).
d. distinct procedural requirements and differences
There are significant procedural requirements and
differences between jurisdiction based on section 571-11(1) and
section 571-11(2).  Of relevance to this case, HRS section 571-44
requires that: “[n]o child under the age of twelve shall be
adjudged to come within section 571-11(1) without the written
recommendation of a licensed psychologist or of a psychiatrist or
other physician duly qualified by special training and experience
in the practice of child psychiatry.”  HRS § 571-44. 
Importantly, the validity of allegations brought
against a child pursuant to section 571-11(1) must meet a higher
burden of proof than allegations brought pursuant to section 571-
11(2).  See HRS § 571-41(c) (providing that petitions alleging
the court’s jurisdiction under section 571-11(1) “shall require   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
29proof beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with rules of
evidence applicable to criminal cases; provided that no child who
is before the court under section 571-11(1) shall have admitted
against the child any evidence in violation of the child’s rights
secured under the constitution of the United States or the State
of Hawaii”).
Further, HRS chapter 571 provides different actions
that the family court is authorized to take following the
adjudication of a child under section 571-11(1) jurisdiction or
under 571-11(2) jurisdiction.  Of relevance here, a child
adjudicated under section 571-11(1) may be placed on probation or
fined.  See HRS § 571-48(1) (2006).  However, a child adjudicated
under section 571-11(2) may not be placed on probation but may be
placed under protective supervision.  HRS § 571-48(2). 
Significantly, HRS chapter 571 defines “protective supervision”
as 
a legal status created by court order in proceedings not
involving violations of law but where the legal custody of
the minor is subject to change, whereby the minor is
permitted to remain in the minor’s home or in a community
residential or nonresidential program under the supervision
of the court or an agency designated by the court and
subject to return to the court during the period of
protective supervision.
  
HRS § 571-2 (emphasis added). 
In summary, the plain language of HRS chapter 571
provides the following relevant guidance:  (1) section 571-11(2)
does not provide the family court with jurisdiction for formal   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
30proceedings that involve allegations of violations of law, see
HRS §§ 571-11(2), 571-2; (2) children alleged to have violated
the law under section 571-11(1) must receive the constitutional
protections and standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in
accordance with rules applicable to criminal cases, see HRS §
571-41(c); and (3) formal proceedings that involve alleged
violations of law are not appropriate for children under twelve
years old unless a qualified physician or psychologist provides a
written recommendation to the contrary, see HRS § 571-44. 
2. The Family Court Erred In Adjudicating NC As A Status
Offender Based On The Allegations Of The Amended
Petition.
The family court’s adjudication of NC as a status
offender was not authorized by HRS section 571-11(2) jurisdiction
and violated the requirements of HRS chapter 571.
NC did not receive informal adjustment in lieu of
formal proceedings.  Rather, as stated previously, the prosecutor
filed a formal petition with the family court on August 4, 2004,
which alleged that NC had “violated or attempted to violate the
law” through four separate counts of “committing the offense of
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of Section 707-
732(1)(b).” 
On September 29, 2004, the prosecutor amended the
petition to restate the four counts against NC as “committing the   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
31offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of
Section 707-7332(1)(b) [sic], [HRS], as amended, brining [sic]
him before this Court as a Person in Need of Supervision under
Sections 571-11(2) and 571-44, [HRS][.]” 
Although the amendments attempted to frame the petition
under HRS section 571-11(2) jurisdiction, the allegations against
NC continued to assert that he had violated HRS section 707-
732(1)(b).  The amended petition did not allege educational
neglect, lack of control by NC’s parents, nonattendance at
school, or a violation of curfew.  See HRS § 571-11(2)(A)-(D).
Neither did the petition state that NC had engaged in behavior
that was injurious to himself or others.  
As set forth in HRS section 571-41(c), the allegations
of the petition determine the burden of proof and the substantive
rights that must apply to a formal action.  HRS § 571-41(c). 
Allegations of law violations in a petition invoke a higher
burden of proof and the presence of federal and state
constitutional protections during the adjudication proceeding. 
Id.  Therefore, based on the allegations of the amended petition,
the family court was obligated to comply with the requirements of
a formal proceeding conducted under HRS section 571-11(1)
jurisdiction, as defined by HRS sections 571-41(c) and 571-44.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
32Nevertheless, the family court’s September 26, 2006
decree found that NC was a status offender and that “the material
allegations of the petition(s) ha[d] been proved by a
preponderance of the evidence[.]”  As the allegations against NC
were based on law violations, HRS section 571-41(c) required that
such allegations be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  HRS § 571-
41(c).  The family court appeared to acknowledge this requirement
in its December 19, 2006 findings of fact, conclusions of law and
order denying the motion for reconsideration where, in contrast
to the decree, it stated that “[b]ased on the reports submitted,
the court found that the allegations were proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.”  The confusion created by the allegations
against NC is further reflected when the order finds that “[NC]
was found to be a person in need of supervision, not a law
violator, based on his age[,]” yet concludes that “the minor was
properly adjudicated under that section [of the statutes
pertaining to sexual assault] for behavior committed prior to the
age of 18 that would constitute a violation of state law.” 
Although the family court’s September 26, 2006 decree
and December 19, 2006 order both state that the allegations of
law violations against NC had been proven, the record in this
case reflects that NC was eleven years old at the time of his
adjudication.  As such, a written recommendation by a qualified   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
33physician or psychologist was required before NC could be
adjudged to come within section 571-11(1) jurisdiction upon law
violation allegations.  See HRS § 571-44.  The record in this
case does not contain such a written recommendation.  
Therefore, NC was adjudicated for alleged violations of
a criminal statute in contravention of the protection provided
for children his age by HRS section 571-44 and the constitutional
protections applied to law violation proceedings by HRS section
571-41(c) and the decisions of Hawaii’s courts.  See In re Doe,
62 Haw. 70, 72-73, 610 P.2d 509, 511 (1980) (recognizing “a
juvenile’s entitlement to adequate written notice, notification
of a right to counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine
witnesses, and the privilege against self-incrimination at an
adjudicatory stage” of proceedings which may result in commitment
to a state institution, as established in In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1
(1967)); In re TC, 121 Hawai# i at 99-102, 214 P.3d at 1089-92
(holding that a minor alleged, pursuant to HRS § 571-11(1), to
have committed law violations shall be advised of his or her
right to testify, and that, where he or she does not testify, the
family court shall obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right).
Accordingly, the family court erred in proceeding under
HRS section 571-11(2) jurisdiction based on the material
allegations of the amended petition.  NC’s substantial rights   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
34were violated when he was adjudicated for alleged law violations
without the statutorily required recommendation of a qualified
physician or psychologist, HRS § 571-44, and without the
constitutional protections that apply to formal proceedings
conducted under HRS section 571-11(1) jurisdiction, see In re TC,
121 Hawai #i at 99-100, 214 P.3d at 1089-90; HRS § 571-41(c).  As
such, the family court’s adjudication of NC is plain error.  See
Kamanao, 103 Hawai #i at 319-20, 82 P.3d at 405-06; HFCR Rule 61.  
IV.  CONCLUSION
Having concluded that NC’s substantial rights were
violated in this case, we vacate the ICA’s June 26, 2009 SDO and
October 28, 2009 judgment on appeal, and reverse the family
court’s September 26, 2006 decree.
