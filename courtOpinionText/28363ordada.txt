and Circuit Judge To' oto'o, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of Allen Vidal’s papers requesting
 
clarification from the supreme court of the intermediate court of
 
appeals’ April 9, 2008 memorandum opinion, it appears that we
 lack jurisdiction to issue such clarification. See
 HRS § 602-5
 
(Supp. 2009). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the request for clarification
 
is dismissed.
