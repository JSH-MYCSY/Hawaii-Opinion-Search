OPINION OF THE COURT BY MOON, C.J.
 
On November 4, 2009, this court accepted a timely 
application for a writ of certiorari filed by petitioner/ 
appellant-appellant Paulette Ka» anohiokalani Kaleikini on 
September 28, 2009, requesting that this court review the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals  (ICA) July 9, 2009 order 
dismissing as moot the appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit s
2 March 16, 2007 order and April 4, 2007 final judgment.

 During the pendency of this action, Laura H. Thielen succeeded Peter
Young as chairperson of the Board of Land Natural Resources (BLNR). Thus,
pursuant to Hawai »i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 43(c)(1) (2009), Thielen
has been substituted automatically for Young in this case.

Therein, the circuit court dismissed Kaleikini s notice of agency
 
appeal on the basis that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. 
Oral argument was held on December 17, 2009.
 
Briefly stated, the O» ahu Island Burial Council (OIBC) 
approved a burial treatment plan submitted by developer General Growth Properties (GGP), involving the disinterment of Native 
Hawaiian burial remains or iwi  discovered at GGP s project site at the Ward Village Shops. Thereafter, Kaleikini, pursuant to Hawai» i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 6E-43 (1993), quoted infra , 
requested a contested case hearing, which was denied by 
respondents/appellees-appellees Peter Young, in his official 
capacity as Chairperson of the BLNR,
3 the BLNR, and the 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) [hereinafter, collectively, DLNR]. Kaleikini then sought judicial review of 
DLNR s denial; however, the circuit court dismissed, sua sponte, 
her agency appeal and an accompanying motion for stay, ruling 
that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Although the circuit 
court recognized that Kaleikini was seeking review of DLNR s 
denial of her request for a contested case hearing, it seemingly 
felt constrained by existing case law to rule that it lacked 
jurisdiction under HRS chapter 91 because no agency contested case had occurred. Kaleikini appealed, and the ICA, thereafter, dismissed her appeal as moot, reasoning that the remedy sought 
by Kaleikini -- [i.e. ,] a determination that the circuit court 
had jurisdiction to review the denial of Kaleikini s request for 
3
 See supra note 1.
 
-2­  
 * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
a contested-case hearing -- [was] no longer necessary[.]  ICA s
 
Order at 3.
 
On application, Kaleikini essentially argues that the
 
ICA erred in dismissing her appeal as moot. As discussed more
 fully infra , we agree with the ICA that Kaleikini s direct appeal
 
was moot; however, unlike the ICA, we hold that Kaleikini s
 appeal falls within the public interest exception to the mootness
 doctrine. Additionally, in addressing the merits of Kaleikini s
 appeal, we hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing
 Kaleikini s agency appeal for a lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction because Kaleikini met the requirements of HRS
 
§ 91-14 (1993 and Supp. 2008), quoted infra. Accordingly, we
 vacate the ICA s order dismissing Kaleikini s appeal for mootness
 and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings
 
consistent with this opinion.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
To understand the context of the instant appeal, 
including the ICA s reasoning, we took judicial notice of a 
separate, but closely related appeal, i.e. , Kaleikini v. Thielen, 
No. 29675. See State v. Kotis, 91 Hawai» i 319, 341 n.25, 984 
P.2d 78, 100 n.25 (1999) (stating that an appellate court may, in its discretion, take judicial notice of files or records of a case on appeal ) (citations and original brackets omitted). We 
recognize, however, that, although a [c]ourt may take judicial 
notice of each document in the [c]ourt s file, it may . . . take 
judicial notice of [only] the truth of facts asserted in 
-3­  
   * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
documents[,] such as orders, judgments[,] and findings of fact
 
[(FOFs)] and conclusions of law [(COLs)] because of the
 
principles of collateral estoppel, res judicata, and the law of
 the case.  Id. at 342, 984 P.2d at 101 (emphasis added) (format
 
altered) (original brackets omitted). Thus, for purposes of this
 
opinion, the factual and procedural background presented below
 
has been drawn from the record on appeal in the instant case
 (i.e., Civ. No. 07-1-0068) and, to the extent allowed by this
 
court s holding in Kotis, emphasized above, the record on appeal
 in the related case (i.e., Civ. No. 07-1-0067).
 
A. Factual and Procedural Background
 
On September 13, 2006, a public hearing was held before 
the OIBC, pursuant to HRS chapter 92 (governing public agency 
meetings and records) and Hawai» i Administrative Regulations 
(HAR) § 13-300-33 (2009),
4 on a proposed burial treatment plan 
4
 HAR § 13-300-33 states in relevant part that:
 
(a) The council shall have jurisdiction over all
requests to preserve or relocate previously identified
Native Hawaiian burial sites.
 
(b) The applicant shall submit a request to preserve
in place or relocate a Native Hawaiian burial site to [DLNR]
in the form of a burial treatment plan. . . . 
(c) The applicant shall consult with [DLNR] in the
development of the burial treatment plan. Once approved by
[DLNR], the applicant shall submit requisite copies of the
completed burial treatment plan for distribution to the
council, accompanied by a simple written request to be
placed on the council agenda for a determination of burial
site treatment.
 
. . . .
 
(f) The council shall render a determination to
preserve in place or relocate previously identified Native
Hawaiian burial sites in accordance with section 13-300-38

in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
submitted to OIBC by GGP, seeking permission to remove iwi
 
discovered by GGP at the Ward Village Shops project area. 
According to the minutes of the meeting, GGP indicated that it
 
was seeking to relocate the iwi into an area where they would be
 safe  and that the construction plans for the project [did] not
 
allow for a lot of redesign.  Kaleikini, who was present at the
 
meeting, is a recognized cultural descendant  to the iwi found
 at the Ward Village Shops project.
5 Kaleikini maintained that,
 
as a Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner, one of the critical
 tenets of Native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices is
 
to ensure that iwi remain undisturbed and that they receive
 
proper care and respect. 
Kaleikini presented testimony against the proposed
 
burial treatment plan at the OIBC meeting. More specifically,
 
the meeting minutes indicate that Kaleikini asserted that GGP
 
4(...continued)
within forty-five days of referral by [DLNR], unless
otherwise extended by agreement between the landowner and
[DLNR].

 The HAR recognizes two types of descendants  -- cultural and lineal. 
Under HAR § 13-300-2 (2009), cultural descendant  means, with respect to nonNative Hawaiian skeletal remains, a claimant recognized by the [island burial]
council after establishing genealogical connections to Native Hawaiian
ancestors who once resided or are buried or both, in the same ahupua
»a or 
district in which certain Native Hawaiian skeletal remains are located or 
originated from.  
Under the same rule, lineal descendant  means, 
with respect to Native Hawaiian skeletal remains, a claimant
who has established to the satisfaction of the council,
direct or collateral genealogical connections to certain
Native Hawaiian skeletal remains, or with respect to non
Native Hawaiian skeletal remains, a claimant who has
established to the satisfaction of [DLNR], direct or
collateral genealogical connections to certain non Native
Hawaiian skeletal remains.

should have made a better  attempt to redesign the project so
 
that the iwi could be preserved in place. Ultimately, the OIBC
 
approved the burial treatment plan by a vote of 6-3 with one
 k nalua  (an undecided vote or a vote to abstain). 
On October 12, 2006, Kaleikini sent a letter to DLNR,
 
requesting that a contested case hearing be held, pursuant to HRS
 chapter 91, to review the OIBC s September 13, 2006 decision to
 relocate the iwi at the Ward Village Shops Project. Therein,
 Kaleikini alleged that she was entitled to a contested case
 hearing pursuant to, inter alia, HRS § 6E-43
6 and HAR 
6
 HRS § 6E-43 provides in relevant part that:
 
(a) At any site, other than a known, maintained,
actively used cemetery where human skeletal remains are
discovered or are known to be buried and appear to be over
fifty years old, the remains and their associated burial
goods shall not be moved without [DLNR] s approval .
 
(b) All burial sites are significant and shall be
preserved in place until compliance with this section ismet, except as provided in section 6E-43.6. The appropriate
island burial council shall determine whether preservationin place or relocation of previously identified nativeHawaiian burial sites is warranted, following criteria whichshall include recognition that burial sites of highpreservation value, such as areas with a concentration ofskeletal remains, or prehistoric or historic burials
associated with important individuals and events, or areas
that are within a context of historic properties, or have
known lineal descendants, shall receive greater
consideration for preservation in place. The criteria shall 
be developed by [DLNR] in consultation with the councils,office of Hawaiian affairs, representatives of development
and large property owner interests, and appropriate Hawaiianorganizations, such as Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai
»i Nei,
through rules adopted pursuant to chapter 91. A council s determination shall be rendered within forty-five days ofreferral by [DLNR] unless otherwise extended by agreementbetween the landowner and [DLNR].

and three members from [BLNR] as a contested case pursuant

Native Hawaiian skeletal remains and any burial goods from a
 
previously identified burial site and who is properly
admitted as a party pursuant to section 13-300-54.
 
(b) Unless specifically prescribed in this chapter or

that in its opinion will best serve the purposes of the
hearing.

 HAR § 13-300-52 states:
 
Request for hearing. (a) A written petition for a
contested case hearing shall be filed, i.e. mailed and
 
postmarked, within forty five days following receipt of
written notification of the council determination except
that where a request for reconsideration of a council
determination is made, the forty five day period to file a
petition shall commence following action by the council to
either deny the request for reconsideration or reaffirm its
original decision following reconsideration.
 
(b) A petition requesting a contested case hearing
shall contain concise statements of:
 
(1)	 The legal authority by which appeal is
requested;
(2)	 The council determination being appealed
and the date of the determination;
(3)	 The nature of the interest that may be

Kaleikini stated that the [OIBC] s determination adversely 
affected her because she was a recognized cultural descendant 
. . . and a possible lineal descendant to the previously 
identified [iwi] at the Ward Village [Shops] project site  and that the OIBC did not (1) consult with [Kaleikini] and » ohana 
(recognized descendants), as [required pursuant to HAR § 13-300-36 (2009) (governing the criteria for evaluating requests to preserve or relocate Native Hawaiian burial sites)]  and (2) adequately evaluate, consider[,] and apply the criteria set forth in HAR [§] 13-300-36[.]  Kaleikini also asserted that 
she believe[d] that certain [OIBC] members [did] not meet the 
criteria required to become a member of the [OIBC] as listed in HAR [§] 13-300-22(b)(2) [(2009) (requiring that Council members [p]ossess an understanding of Hawaiian culture, history,
 
customs, practices, and[,] in particular, beliefs and practices
 
relating to the care and protection of Native Hawaiian burial
 sites and ancestral remains and burial goods )] and [that] their
 
decision to relocate was based on their inadequate cultural
 
understanding of the care and protection of ancestral burials.  
Finally, Kaleikini contended that she was entitled to a contested
 
case hearing because her constitutional rights as a native
 Hawaiian  -- specifically, those rights contained in article XII,

by the relocation of [the iwi].  
On December 12, 2006, DLNR denied Kaleikini s request
 
for a contested case hearing via letter, stating that:
 
The law permits an aggrieved person to administratively
appeal burial council determinations. A request for a
contested case will be approved when valid grounds for such
requests are present. The reasons underlying your appeal of
OIBC s prior determinations are neither factually nor
legally sufficient to warrant a contested case proceeding.
Accordingly, your request for a contested case is denied.
 
On January 10, 2007, Kaleikini filed a notice of agency
 
appeal with the circuit court, seeking review of DLNR s December
 
12, 2006 denial of her request for a contested case hearing
 [hereinafter, the agency appeal case]. On the same day,
 
Kaleikini filed a separate complaint in Civ. No. 07-1-0067-01,
 
the previously mentioned related case, seeking declaratory relief
 
and an injunction to prevent the imminent removal of the iwi from
 the Ward Village Shops project area [hereinafter, the dec
 
action]. In her six-count complaint, brought against GGP, Young,
 BLNR, and DLNR, Kaleikini sought, inter alia, (1) a declaration
 
that DLNR s denial of Kaleikini s request for a contested case
 hearing was without basis and invalid and (2) an order requiring
 
that a contested case hearing be held.

tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians who 
inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778, subject to theright of the State to regulate such rights.

1. Agency Appeal Case
 
On February 21, 2007, Kaleikini filed a motion for a
 
stay in the agency appeal, seeking to prevent DLNR from granting
 
final approval of GGP s [b]urial [t]reatment [p]lan, which would
 allow the immediate disinterment of human remains discovered on
 
the project site, until a decision on the merits of [the] agency
 
appeal [was] issued by [the circuit court]. 
10 A hearing was
 
held on Kaleikini s motion for a stay on February 22, 2007. At
 the outset of the hearing, the circuit court stated that:
 
I do know and appreciate from [Kaleikini] . . . that
you have filed a [dec action], which I think is the only way
now that you can actually get judicial review of the relief.
 
Because, as I have read Aha Hui Malama o Kaniakapupu
v. Land Use Commission, 111 Haw[ai »i] 124[, 139 P.3d 712
(2006) [hereinafter, Kaniakapupu ,]] . . . affirming [the
circuit c]ourt s decision that [it] lack[ed] subject matterjurisdiction because there was no contested case hearing
decision appealed from, it s clear that while you reappealing the decision not to give a contested case,obviously there hasn t been one. 
Now, I actually remember [Kaleikini s attorney] being
here on a different case where it was, if I m not mistaken,
the same situation. And he was very articulate in
suggesting that it s a major Catch 22, because if you re
denied a contested case hearing, and the denial can t be
appealed, then there is no way to get judicial review of
that. And any agency could improperly deny a contested case
hearing.
 
10
 Pursuant to HAR § 13-300-38(f) (2009), [w]here a council
determination to relocate is accepted as final, the applicant shall develop
the burial site component of the archaeological data recovery plan . . . and
any accepted recommendations relating to burial site treatment. Within ninety
days of the council determination, [DLNR] shall approve the plan following
consultation with the applicant, any known lineal descendants, the appropriate
council, and any appropriate Hawaiian organizations. 
 
-10­  
    
  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
Well, the Supreme Court didn t actually answer that in
. . . Kaniakapupu . But the majority said . . . [ ]if the
[c]ircuit [c]ourt has no jurisdiction to determine if an
appellant were [sic] entitled to a contested case hearing
after having requested one, any agency could arbitrarily and
capriciously deny anyone a hearing at any time, regardless
of whether such hearing were required by law, and the
aggrieved party could never obtain judicial review of such
denial . . . .[ ]
 
However, in [Kaniakapupu ], the Hui did not request a
contested case hering [sic]. Indeed, the Hui concede[d]
that . . . [ ]there is no procedural vehicle for any party
or interested person to obtain a contested case hearing on
whether a petitioner has failed to perform according to the
conditions imposed, or failed to perform according to
representations or commitments she made . . . .[ ] 
. . . 
So [the circuit court], while not sure about
it, because they didn t actually answer the question,
believe[s] that the filing of the [dec action], assigned to
Judge Lee, is the proper vehicle. That [the circuit court]
doesn t have jurisdiction, because there wasn t a contested
case hearing.
[11]
 
Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed Kaleikini s agency
 
appeal case. Additionally, the circuit court ruled that,
 
inasmuch as it did not have jurisdiction to hear the agency
 appeal, Kaleikini s motion for a stay was rendered moot. 
However, recognizing the pending dec action, the circuit court
 sua sponte re-filed Kaleikini s motion for a stay in that case. 
An order dismissing Kaleikini s agency appeal for lack of subject
 matter jurisdiction, consistent with the circuit court s oral
 
11
 The circuit court additionally stated:
 
Well, I may be wrong. But I would ask you folks to
read what I believe is the current and most recent decision.
 
I read the part that I thought was the most pertinent as to
that. And it does leave an opening because in this case
they ruled that in order to get a contested case hearing you
have to put that in writing, which [Kaleikini s attorneys]
did, I m understanding.
 
. . . . 
And frankly, it wouldn t hurt my feelings . . . if
[Kaleikini s attorney] for purpose of knowing the future
takes it up, because this is a question the [s]upreme
[c]ourt did not answer.

circuit court entered its final judgment. On April 9, 2007,
 
Kaleikini filed a timely notice of appeal in the case at bar from
 the circuit court s March 16, 2007 order and April 4, 2007 final
 judgment. 
2. Dec Action
 
As indicated above, Kaleikini s motion for a stay was
 
re-filed on February 22, 2007 in the dec action and sought to
 prevent DLNR and its chairperson from approving GGP s [b]urial
 [t]reatment [p]lan, which would allow the immediate disinterment
 
of human remains discovered on the project site, until a decision
 on the merits of [the] agency appeal [was] issued by [the circuit
 
court].  A hearing was held on Kaleikini s motion for a stay on
 February 23, 2007,
12 but no transcript of the proceeding was
 
provided in the record on appeal for the dec action. On March
 28, 2007, an order denying Kaleikini s motion for a stay was
 
entered. 
On February 28, 2007, Kaleikini filed a motion for a
 
preliminary injunction, seeking again to prevent DLNR from
 
approving GGP s burial treatment plan and to prohibit GGP from
 disinterring numerous graves and relocating ancient Hawaiian
 
human skeletal remains (iwi) located there.  Both DLNR and GGP
 
opposed the motion. After a hearing on October 24, 25, and 26,

 The Honorable Randall K.O. Lee presided over Kaleikini s motion for
a stay.

2007, the circuit court,13 on November 27, 2007, filed an order
 
denying Kaleikini s motion for a preliminary injunction. 
On August 21, 2007, Kaleikini filed a motion for
 
summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that DLNR failed to hold a
 
contested case hearing as required by law. Both DLNR and GGP
 
opposed Kaleikini s motion for summary judgment. A hearing was
 
apparently held on Kaleikini s motion on September 27, 2007;
 
however, no transcript of the hearing was included in the record
 
on appeal in the dec action. On October 12, 2007, the circuit
 court denied Kaleikini s motion for summary judgment. 
On October 29, 2007, Kaleikini -- with permission of
 
the circuit court -- filed a seven-count second amended complaint
 in the dec action.
14 Therein, Kaleikini alleged that she was
 
entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief because: 
(1) DLNR s denial of Kaleikini s request for a contested case hearing was without basis and invalid (count 1); (2) [t]he disinterment of Native Hawaiian burials in this instance would adversely affect [Kaleikini] s Native Hawaiian rights and would 
violate Art. XII § 7 of the Hawai» i State Constitution  (count 
2); (3) the OIBC s failure to investigate alternatives and 
require the developer to explore alternatives [was] a breach of 
its public trust responsibilities  (count 3); (4) the OIBC s

 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided over the remainder of the dec
action.

in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
decision to remove the burials violated Kaleikini s fundamental
 
rights because [p]rotection of burials is a fundamental right
 that all citizens enjoy  and that the OIBC s decision was not
 
narrowly tailored given its failure to consider alternatives 
 
(count 4); (5) the disinterment of iwi in this instance [would]
 violate HRS § 6E-43 and HAR § 13-300-36  (count 5); (6) the
 proposal to remove iwi would irreparably injure the iwi and
 
relief was needed pursuant to HRS § 6E-13 (1993) (governing
 
enforcement of chapter 6E, which relates to historic
 preservation) (count 6); and (7) DLNR failed to consult with
 
Kaleikini and others prior to authorizing the removal of many of
 the inadvertently discovered burial remains as required by law 
 
or to properly consider the criteria provided in HAR § 13-300-36
 
prior to authorizing the removal of many of the inadvertently
 discovered burial remains  (count 7). 
On January 30, 2008, DLNR filed a motion for summary
 
judgment, arguing that judgment should be entered in its favor as
 
to all of Kaleikini s claims because, as a matter of law,
 [Kaleikini could not] prevail on the merits of her claims against
 [DLNR].  On February 11, 2008, GGP filed a substantive joinder
 
in DLNR s motion for summary judgment. Kaleikini opposed DLNR s
 
motion, and, on March 4, 2008, a hearing was held regarding,
 
inter alia, DLNR s motion for summary judgment. At the close of
 
the hearing, the circuit court orally granted DLNR s motion for
 
summary judgment and GGP s joinder as to count 1 (denial of

trust), and count 4 (violation of fundamental rights), reasoning 
that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to those 
counts inasmuch as DLNR was within [its] discretion to decide whether there was a legal basis for a contested case hearing  and that Kaleikini s constitutional claims were not supported by 
Hawaii s case law. With regard to count 5 (violation of HRS 
§ 6E-43, HAR § 13-30-36), count 6 (irreparable injury to iwi), and count 7 (improper decision-making authorizing the removal of 
many inadvertent discoveries), the court found that issues of material fact existed and, thus, denied DLNR s motion for summary 
judgment and GGP s joinder as to those counts. A written order 
confirming the circuit court s oral ruling was filed on March 19, 2008. 
On June 10, 2008, the parties filed a stipulation to 
dismiss all of the remaining claims in the second amended
 
complaint (i.e. , counts 5, 6, and 7) with prejudice, pursuant to
 
a settlement agreement, which the circuit court approved. 
Thereafter, the circuit court entered a judgment in favor of
 
DLNR, but for reasons that are not relevant to the issues before
 
this court, subsequently entered a first and second amended
 judgment in the dec action on February 9 and February 27, 2009,
 
respectively. Kaleikini filed a timely notice of appeal from the

B. Appeal of the Instant Agency Appeal Case Before the ICA
 
Relying primarily on Public Access Shoreline Hawai» i v. 
Hawai» i County Planning Commission [hereinafter, PASH], 79 Hawai» i 
425, 903 P.2d 1246 (1995), Kaleikini argued before the ICA that
 the circuit court erred in dismissing sua sponte her agency
 
appeal for lack of jurisdiction. She maintained that the circuit
 court had subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to HRS chapter
 91. In response, DLNR contended that HRS chapter 91 -­

 HRS § 91-14 provides in relevant part that:
 
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order
in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature
that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final
decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief is
entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter; but
nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to
other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo,
including the right of trial by jury, provided by law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term person
aggrieved  shall include an agency that is a party to a
contested case proceeding before that agency or another
 
agency.
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, proceedings
for review shall be instituted in the circuit court within
 thirty days after the preliminary ruling or within thirty

decision and order of the agency pursuant to rule of court,
except where a statute provides for a direct appeal to the
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602. . . .

confer jurisdiction on the circuit court to review DLNR s denial
 
of Kaleikini s request for a contested case hearing because
 Kaleikini did not participate in a contested case.  
On June 2, 2009, the ICA issued an order requesting
 
supplemental memoranda, stating specifically:
 
Inasmuch as Kaleikini, in filing the separate
proceeding in [the dec action] may have already obtained the
remedy she seeks in this appeal -- judicial review of
[DLNR] s allegedly wrongful denial of her request for a
contested-case hearing and a stay of decisionmaking [sic] on
the burial-treatment plan for the project -- this appeal may
be moot. 
To assist this court in determining whether an actual
controversy continues to exist in this case [(i.e. , the
agency appeal case)], Kaleikini and [DLNR] are hereby
directed to file supplemental memoranda not to exceed five
pages, no later than ten calendar days from the filing of
this order, discussing the following issues:
 
(1) The status of [the dec action] and whether any
orders, decisions, or judgments have been rendered [therein]
that affect this appeal and any remedial relief sought by
Kaleikini in [the agency appeal case];
(2) Whether the burial-treatment plan for the project
has been implemented; and
(3) Why this appeal is not moot.
 
On June 12, 2009, Kaleikini filed her supplemental
 
memorandum, indicating that, although she had filed a notice of
 
appeal from the circuit court s February 9 and February 27, 2009
 amended judgments in the dec action, the proceedings were stayed
 due to GGP s notice of filing of bankruptcy. Thus, Kaleikini
 contended that she had 
 not received the relief she requested in
 
[the agency appeal] from [the dec action].  (Emphasis in
 
original.) With regard to whether the burial treatment plan had
 
been implemented, Kaleikini stated it was her understanding that
 all the terms of the current burial treatment plan [had] not  been
 
-17­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
fully implemented.  (Emphasis in original.) Additionally,
 
Kaleikini acknowledged that the parties had entered into a
 settlement agreement in the dec action with respect to counts 5-7
 
of her second amended complaint, but indicated that the
 
settlement agreement did not  settle [c]ounts 1-4, which
 
include[d] the [c]ount regarding the denial of the contested case
 hearing  and, in fact, Kaleikini stated that [t]he settlement
 
explicitly acknowledged [Kaleikini] s right to appeal [c]ounts 1­
4 . . . [and, thus, t]he settlement did not affect [Kaleikini] s
 rights in this appeal.  (Emphasis in original.) Lastly,
 
Kaleikini asserted that, [e]ven if the [ICA] were to interpret
 the settlement agreement so broadly as to resolve the issue of
 
the contested case and burial treatment plan, exceptions to the
 
mootness doctrine clearly apply ; specifically, the public
 interest and the capable of repetition yet evading review
 
exceptions. 
Conversely, DLNR -- in its supplemental memorandum
 
filed on June 15, 2009 -- asserted that the mootness doctrine
 would be properly invoked in the case at bar because (1) [the
 dec action] substantively disposed of the issue on appeal in [the
 
agency appeal case]  and (2) the terms of the [s]ettlement
 
[a]greement provided that all of the previously identified
 burials . . . would be reinterred either in a [c]entral [b]urial
 
[p]reservation [s]ite or in a specific reburial site for
 
-18­  
  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
specified remains. 17 In DLNR s view, Kaleikini s appeal was
 
moot because 
the parties [had] . . . agreed to the relocation
 
and reinterment of the burials, which ha[d] already occurred , 
 
and, thus, there [was] no basis for contesting the decision of
 
the OIBC to relocate the burials and there [was] no effective
 remedy which this court could order in this case.  (Emphasis
 added.) 
On July 9, 2009, the ICA issued an order dismissing
 
Kaleikini s appeal as moot. Therein, the ICA stated, inter alia,
 
that:
 
17
 The settlement agreement, which was attached as Exhibit A  to
 
DLNR s supplemental memorandum, provided in relevant part that Kaleikini
expressed her support and agreement with the April 9, 2008[] OIBC
recommendation in favor of the Addendum to the Burial Treatment Plan, 
discussed below. Additionally, the agreement stated:
 
The disinterment of Native Hawaiian remains is wholly
inconsistent with [Kaleikini] s cultural beliefs and
Kaleikini opposes the disinterment of any burials on the
property on that basis. Kaleikini agrees, however, that the
Central Burial Preservation Site shall be used for the
 reinterment of the subject and all other burial remains
which may be encountered on the [p]roperty, and for which
disinterment and relocation have been properly authorized.
[Kaleikini] hereby confirms her support of such use of the
Central Burial Preservation Site and agrees that she shall
not seek to prevent the use of the Central Burial Site in
any administrative or judicial proceedings or actions, or
otherwise. 
Also attached as Exhibit A  to DLNR s supplemental memorandum was
a copy of what was purported to be a draft of the addendum to the burial
treatment plan to the Ward Village Shops project. The addendum indicates
 
that, between March and October 2007, fifty-four more iwi were inadvertently
discovered in the project area during the excavation associated with the
 
disinterment of the [eleven] previously identified [iwi], during excavation
related to project construction, and during subsequent . . . authorized
exploratory excavation.  The addendum proposes that (1) thirty-one of the
inadvertently discovered iwi would be preserved in place and (2) the remaining
iwi would be disinterred, stored, and then reinterred in, among other places,
a central burial site.

in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
Based on our review of the record in this appeal, this
court s Order Requesting Supplemental Memoranda  filed on
June 2, 2009, Kaleikini s supplemental memorandum filed on
June 12, 2009, and [DLNR s] supplemental memorandum filed on
June 15, 2009, it appears that . . . , Kaleikini filed a
[dec. action] which, among other claims, challenged (1) the
denial of her request for a contested-case hearing, and (2)
the [OIBC] s approval for disinterment and relocation of the
historic remains. In [the dec action], the circuit court
dismissed Kaleikini s claim for wrongful denial of her
request for a contested-case hearing via summary judgment.
Her remaining claims were dismissed by summary judgment or
stipulation of the parties. Subsequently, the parties
entered into a settlement agreement, general release, and
waiver of claims (settlement agreement). Pursuant to the
 
settlement agreement, the parties agreed to a revised burial
plan that addressed the inadvertently discovered and future
discoveries of historic remains. The revised burial plan
has been implemented.
 
Inasmuch as the remedy sought by Kaleikini -- a
determination that the circuit court had jurisdiction to
review the denial of Kaleikini s request for a
contested-case hearing -- is no longer necessary, this
appeal is moot. See Carl Corp. v. State, Dep
»t of Educ., 93
Hawai»i 155, 164, 997 P.2d 567, 576 (2000) (holding that
invocation of the mootness doctrine is proper where events
 
have so affected the relations between the parties that the
two conditions [for] justiciability relevant on
appeal -- adverse interest and effective remedy -- have been
compromised  ). (Ellipsis omitted.)[18] 
(Emphasis added.) (Footnote omitted.) Thereafter, this court
 
accepted Kaleikini s application on November 4, 2009 and heard
 oral argument on December 17, 2009. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject
 
matter jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter
 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo.  
Hamilton v. Lethem , 119 Hawai» i 1, 4-5, 193 P.3d 839, 842-43 
(2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
18
 Although Kaleikini maintained on appeal that exceptions to the
mootness doctrine clearly apply,  the ICA apparently failed to address them. 
-20­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
III. DISCUSSION
 
As previously indicated, Kaleikini argues that the ICA
 
erred when it concluded that Kaleikini s appeal was moot and did
 
not address whether it fell within any exceptions to the mootness
 
doctrine. More specifically, Kaleikini contends that [t]he ICA
 erred in its decision because (1) the case is not moot; (2) this
 case falls squarely within the public interest  exception to the
 
mootness doctrine; and (3) this case would also fall within the
 capable of repetition yet evading review  exception to the
 mootness doctrine.  Additionally, Kaleikini raises the following
 
questions: (1) [w]hat procedure should be used to challenge an
 agency s denial of a request for a contested case hearing ;
 
(2) [d]oes a recognized cultural descendent to Native Hawaiian
 
burial remains (iwi), who engages in traditional and customary
 
practices with respect to those remains, have the right to a
 
contested case hearing on a decision to remove iwi ; and
 (3) [h]ow can a Native Hawaiian and a cultural descendent of iwi
 
obtain timely judicial review of an administrative decision to
 remove iwi?  (Emphasis in original omitted.) 
A. Mootness
 
In her application, Kaleikini states:
 
The issues . . . in this appeal are not moot. 
. . . Kaleikini asked that . . . [DLNR] s decision to deny
her request for a contested case hearing be reversed; that
the [circuit] court issue an order requiring a contested
case hearing; that a decision on the burial treatment plan
be stayed; that she be awarded attorney s fees and costs;
and that the [circuit] court provide such other relief as is
just and proper.
 
-21­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
(Emphasis in original.) However, during oral argument, Kaleikini
 
conceded that the denial of [her request for a contested case
 hearing] essentially mooted her claim because of the passage of
 
time.  As a result, Kaleikini focused her argument before this
 
court on the exceptions to the mootness doctrine, i.e. , public
 
interest and capable of repetition yet evading review. Based on
 Kaleikini s concession, we hold that the instant appeal is moot
 
and turn to examine whether Kaleikini s appeal falls within any
 
of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine.
 B.	 Public Interest Exception to the Mootness Doctrine
 
Kaleikini argues that the public interest exception
 
applies here because the question presented in this case involves
 two important issues : (1) the rights of Native Hawaiians; and
 
(2) access to the courts. This court has stated that, [w]hen analyzing the public interest exception, [it] look[s] to (1) the 
public or private nature of the question presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination for future guidance of public officers, and (3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question.  Hamilton , 119 Hawai» i at 6-7, 193 
P.3d at 844-45 (citation omitted) (some brackets in original). 
This court recently examined the public interest exception in 
Hamilton  and stated that: 
[T]he cases in this jurisdiction that have applied the
public interest exception have focused largely on political
or legislative issues that affect a significant number ofHawai
»i residents. For example, in Doe [v. Doe , 116 Hawai »i 
323, 172 P.3d 1067 (2007)], we held that the public interestexception applied because it was in the public s interest 
-22­  
 * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
for this court to review the family court s ruling that
Hawaii s grandparent visitation statute [was]unconstitutional on its face.  Id. at 327, 172 P.3d at
1071. Additionally, in Kaho
»ohanohano v. State , 114 Hawai »i 
302, 162 P.3d 696 (2007), this court held that the subject
appeal was of a public nature because the outcome wouldaffect all state and county employees. Id. at 333, 162 P.3d
at 727. Likewise, in Right to Know Committee v. City &
County of Honolulu, 117 Hawai
»i 1, 175 P.3d 111 (App. 2007),
the ICA held that the question presented was of a public
nature because the issue whether the City council mustconduct its business in full view of the public and incompliance with the Sunshine Law was more public in naturethan private. Id. at 9, 175 P.3d at 119. 
Id. at 7, 193 P.3d at 845.
 
As indicated by Kaleikini, the issue presented here
 
-- the availability of judicial review of decision relating to
 
the removal of Native Hawaiian burial sites -- is of great public
 
importance. In amending chapter 6E to include, inter alia, the
 
relevant sections pertaining to Native Hawaiian burial sites, the
 
legislature specifically recognized that [a]ll human skeletal
 remains and burial sites within the State are entitled to equal
 
protection under the law regardless of race, religion, or
 
cultural origin. The public has a vital interest in the proper
 
disposition of the bodies of its deceased persons, which is in
 
the nature of a sacred trust for the benefit of all[.] 1990 Haw.
 Sess. Laws Act 306, § 1 at 956 (emphasis added). The legislature
 further found that native Hawaiian traditional prehistoric and
 
unmarked burials are especially vulnerable and often not afforded
 the protection of law which assures dignity and freedom from
 
unnecessary disturbance.  Id. Such legislative pronouncements
 
evince a recognition of the public importance of the issue
 
-23­  
   * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
presented here, i.e. , the process of deciding to remove
 
previously identified Native Hawaiian burial sites.  Thus, the
 
question presented here, like in Right to Know, is of a public
 
nature. 
Second, as reflected in the circuit court s statements
 
(1) indicating confusion surrounding the issue whether an
 
appellant may seek review of an agency s denial  of a request for
 
a contested case hearing and (2) suggesting the need for an
 authoritative answer from this court regarding the issue, it
 would seem desirable for this court to provide an authoritative
 
determination providing future guidance for public officials. 
Lastly, with respect to the third prong, the likelihood of future
 
recurrence of the question seems high inasmuch as it seems
 
probable that iwi will continue to be unearthed at future
 construction projects. Accordingly, we conclude that the public
 
interest exception applies to the case at bar.
19 We now turn to
 
discuss the merits of Kaleikini s contentions on appeal. 
C. Merits of Kaleikini s Appeal
 
As quoted supra, Kaleikini presents three questions to
 
this court for decision; however, all three questions center
 
around the issue whether the circuit court erred in dismissing
 
Kaleikini s agency appeal on jurisdictional grounds. As
 
19
 Inasmuch as we conclude that the public interest exception applies
to the facts presented here, it is not necessary to address Kaleikini s
arguments relating to the applicability of the capable of repetition yet
evading review exception to the mootness doctrine.
 
-24­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
previously stated, the circuit court dismissed Kaleikini s agency 
appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Kaleikini did not participate in a contested case hearing. On application, 
Kaleikini contends that the circuit court, in so doing, erred 
because [t]his court[] has, in three cases, stated that a chapter 91 appeal to the circuit court is the correct procedure to challenge an agency s denial of a request for a contested case 
hearing (if a right to a contested case exists and proper 
procedures are followed).  (Citing Mortensen v. Board of 
Trustees of Emp. Ret. Syst. Trustees, 52 Haw. 212, 473 P.2d 866 
(1970), Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture , 77 Hawai» i 
64, 881 P.2d 1210 (1994), and PASH ).
 The right to appeal is purely statutory and exists 
only when jurisdiction is given by some constitutional or statutory provision.  Lingle v. Hawai» i Gov» t. Employees Ass n , 
107 Hawai» i 178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 (2005). HRS § 91-14 
confers jurisdiction on the circuit court to review final 
decision[s] and order[s] in [] contested case[s].  As previously quoted, HRS § 91-14 provides in relevant part that: 
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order
in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature
that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final
decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief is
entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter; but
nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to
other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo,
including the right of trial by jury, provided by law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term person
aggrieved  shall include an agency that is a party to a
contested case proceeding before that agency or another
 agency.
 
-25­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
(Emphasis added.)
 
In dismissing the agency appeal, the circuit court
 
relied exclusively on this court s decision in Kaniakapupu.
 
Specifically, the circuit court stated: 
Because, as I have read . . . Kaniakapupu  . . .
 
affirming [the circuit c]ourt s decision that [it] lack[ed]
subject matter jurisdiction because there was no contested
case hearing decision appealed from, it s clear that while
you re appealing the decision not to give a contested case,
obviously there hasn t been one. 
In other words, the circuit court determined that it did not have
 
jurisdiction over Kaleikini s agency appeal, brought pursuant to
 HRS § 91-14, because she did not participate  in a contested case
 
hearing. On direct appeal, Kaleikini submitted that the circuit
 
court erred in its interpretation of Kaniakapupu  and extended the
 
holding of that case too far  inasmuch as Kaniakapupu  merely
 
stands for the proposition that the circuit court does not have
 jurisdiction [where] no contested case  hearing [is] required by
 
law.  Kaleikini asserts that the circuit court should have,
 instead, looked at the framework set forth by this court in PASH
 
to determine whether it had jurisdiction to review the denial of
 a request for a contested case hearing.  Inasmuch as the circuit
 court s ruling was based primarily on Kaniakapupu, we first
 
address the applicability of that case to the facts presented
 
here.
 
1. Kaniakapupu
 
In Kaniakapupu, landowners of a parcel of land
 
petitioned the Land Use Commission (LUC) to amend the land use

in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
district boundary on the parcel of land from conservation 
district to urban district. 111 Hawai» i at 126, 139 P.3d at 714. 
The landowners indicated that they sought reclassification of the 
property to enable them to subdivide the [p]roperty, construct 
both replacement and new houses on the [p]roperty, and make such other repair and improvements of the existing units in a manner ordinarily and customarily allowed for urban residential uses and 
thereby provide house lots or homes for their children.  Id. A 
hearing was held before the LUC, and, thereafter, the LUC entered 
FOFs, COLS, and a decision and order, approving the 
reclassification. Id. In its FOFs, the LUC found that the 
landowners, 
in order to provide reasonable assurance to the LUC that the
proposed development is a family enterprise to provide
housing for the family members and not a commercial
enterprise for speculation, . . . represented that they
[were] willing to be subjected to a condition that members
of the families . . . would have a right of first refusal to
purchase if any interest in the [p]roperty were sought to be
sold.
 
Id. (original brackets omitted). Thus, the LUC imposed a
 
condition on the landowners that, should they desire to sell or
 
convey ownership of all or portions of the property, [they]
 
shall first offer such interest to the other or in the
 
alternative convey such interest to any of [their] children, as
 
the case may be.  Id. (original emphasis omitted).
 
Kaniakapupu -- the historic ruins of the royal summer
 
cottage of Kamehameha III -- is located on property owned by the
 
State that shares a common boundary with, and is situated

   * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * *

approximately 200 to 300 feet from, the [reclassified property].  
Id. at 126-27, 139 P.3d at 714-15. Approximately eleven years
 
after the LUC approved reclassification of the property, a
 Hui[20] was formed in order to care for and serve as a steward
 
of Kaniakapupu.   Id.  at 126, 139 P.3d at 714. Thereafter, the
 
Hui sought to have the LUC issue an order to show cause [(OSC)]
 as to why the classification of the [property] should not be
 
reverted to conservation district,  contending that one of the
 
landowners had violated the condition imposed by the LUC inasmuch
 as she listed portions of the property for sale to the public. 
Id. at 127, 139 P.3d at 715. The Hui additionally requested that
 
a hearing be held, pursuant to HAR § 15-15-70(c) (governing
 motions practice), on its motion for an OSC. Id. The LUC held
 
a hearing on the Hui s motion for an OSC [hereinafter, motion
 
hearing] and, thereafter, denied it on the basis that the Hui had
 
not met its burden of demonstrating a failure to perform a
 condition, representation, or commitment on the part of the
 landowners. Id. at 128, 139 P.3d at 716.
 
20

corporation, company, institution, organization, band, league, firm, joint

The Hui filed a notice of appeal with the circuit court
 
and, after briefing by the parties, the circuit court dismissed
 
the Hui s appeal for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id.
 
at 129, 131, 139 P.3d at 717, 719. More specifically, the
 circuit court found that
 
the LUC did not hold a contested case hearing. . . . If the
 
motion for an [OSC] had been granted, then a contested case
hearing would have been required. 
. . . . 
The [circuit] court concludes that the requirement in
HRS § 91-14 that the order appealed from arise from a
contested case hearing, has not been met. As such, this
court lacks jurisdiction to reach the issue of whether a
contested case hearing was required. See Pele Defense Fund
 
v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai »i 64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d
1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). This court can only dismiss theappeal and therefore does so. 
Id. (original brackets omitted) (format altered). The Hui
 
appealed the circuit court s decision to this court. Id. at 131,
 
139 P.3d at 719. 
At the outset, this court set forth the applicable law,
 
stating that:
 HRS § 91-14(a) provides the means by which judicial
review of administrative contested cases can be obtained. 
Among its prerequisites, the section requires that a
contested case must have occurred before appellatejurisdiction may be exercised.  Pele Defense Fund v. Puna 
Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai
»i 64, 67, 881 P.2d 1210, 1213
(1994) (citation omitted). HRS § 91-1(5) (1993) defines a
contested case  as a proceeding in which the legal rights,
duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by
law to be determined after an opportunity for agencyhearing.  HRS § 91-1(6) (1993), in turn, defines an agencyhearing  as such hearing held by an agency immediately
prior to a judicial review of a contested case as provided
in section 91-14.  Thus, [a] contested case is an agency
hearing that [(]1) is required by law and [(]2) determines
the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties.

quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). 
Id. at 132, 139 P.3d at 720 (emphasis added).

In applying the above test, the Kaniakapupu court
 
explained that the Hui s motion for an [OSC] was essentially a
 
threshold motion or procedural vehicle to obtain a show cause
 
hearing in order for  the LUC to determine the rights, duties, or
 
privileges of specific parties.  Id. at 134, 139 P.3d at 722
 
(emphasis in original). Thus, the Kaniakapupu  court held that,
 
although the motion hearing was required by law, i.e., not
 discretionary and mandated by HRS § 15-15-70(i), it did not
 
determine the rights, duties, or privileges of the parties
 because the hearing merely addressed whether a not a contested
 
case hearing was required regarding the Hui s motion to show
 cause. Id. at 133-34, 139 P.3d at 721-22. 
The Kaniakapupu  court, however, acknowledged the
 
argument raised by the Hui that, if the circuit court has no
 jurisdiction to determine if an appellant were entitled to a
 
contested case hearing after having requested one, any agency
 could arbitrarily and capriciously deny anyone a hearing at any
 time, regardless of whether such hearing were required by law,
 and the aggrieved party could never obtain judicial review of
 such denial.  Id. at 137, 139 P.3d at 725 (original brackets
 
omitted). Nevertheless, this court held such argument was
 without merit, indicating that the Hui did not request a
 contested case hearing and emphasizing that, [i]ndeed, the Hui
 
concede[d] that there is no procedural vehicle for any party or
 
interested person  to obtain a contested case hearing on whether
 
-30­  
  
  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
a petitioner has failed to perform according to the conditions
 
imposed or has failed to perform according to the representations
 or commitments she made.  Id. (original brackets and some
 
internal quotation marks omitted).
 
Here, unlike in Kaniakapupu , there is  a procedural
 
vehicle for any party or interested person  to obtain a
 contested case,  i.e. , HAR § 13-300-51, and Kaleikini did request
 
a contested case hearing pursuant to that rule. Indeed, it is
 undisputed, as discussed more fully infra , that Kaleikini
 
followed the procedures set forth for requesting a contested case
 
hearing.
21 Thus, Kaniakapupu  is distinguishable from the instant
 
21
 We note that, in Hui Kakoo Aina Hoopulapula v. Board of Land and
Natural Resources, 112 Hawai »i 28, 143 P.3d 1230 (2006), this court also
determined that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over an agency
appeal because, although DLNR properly promulgated specific procedures for a
contested case hearing [,]. . . the [a]ppellants failed to follow therequisite procedures, [and, thus,] there was no contested case from which theAppellants could appeal, pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a).  112 Hawai
»i at 41, 143
P.3d at 1243. See also Simpson v. Dep »t of Land & Natural Res., 8 Haw. App.
16, 24-25, 791 P.2d 1267, 1273 (1990) (holding that a public hearing requiredby law is not a contested case where (1) the agency has properly promulgatedspecific procedures for a contested case hearing and (2) a party has failed tofollow such procedures).

in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
case on that ground.22 As such, the appropriate inquiry here is
 
whether Kaleikini has met the requirements of HRS § 91-14. PASH, 
79 Hawai» i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252 (indicating that the 
necessary inquiry  was whether the appellant met the requirements
 
of HRS § 91-14).
 
2. Contested Case Hearing
 
In PASH, we described the requirements of HRS § 91-14
 
as follows: 
first, the proceeding that resulted in the unfavorable
agency action must have been a contested case  hearing
--i.e., a hearing that was [(]1) required by law  and
[(]2) determined the rights, duties, and privileges of
specific parties ; second, the agency s action must
represent a final decision and order,  or a preliminary
ruling  such that deferral of review would deprive the
claimant of adequate relief; third, the claimant must have
followed the applicable agency rules and, therefore, have
been involved in  the contested case; and finally, the
claimant s legal interests must have been injured -- i.e.,
the claimant must have standing to appeal.
 
22
 The concurrence contends that our attempt to distinguish Kaniakapupu
is illusory  because HRS § 91-14(a) and the case law interpreting HRS
§ 91-14(a) do not make any reference to a procedural vehicle  as a
prerequisite to a contested case hearing.  Concurring op. at 36, 37. More
 specifically, the concurrence argues that
 
HRS § 91-14(a) does not suggest that there is a differentstandard applied to those persons aggrieved who have broughta contested case under a procedural vehicle  provision from
those persons aggrieved who have brought a contested case in
the absence of a procedural vehicle.  See E & J Lounge
[Operating Co., Inc. v. Liquor Comm n of City and County ofHonolulu], 118 Hawai
»i [320,] 330, 189 P.3d [432,] 442
[(2008)]; PASH, 79 Hawai »i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252; Puna 
Geothermal, 77 Hawai »i at 67, 881 P.2d at 1213. 
Id. at 37-38. 
As indicated above, the procedural vehicle  in this case is HAR
§ 13-300-51, and such rule provides the legal authority for aggrieved persons
to request and obtain contested case hearings to appeal burial council
determinations. Because the Hui in Kaniakapupu had no similar authority to
request or obtain a contested case hearing, the case at bar is distinguishable
from Kaniakapupu  and such distinction is not illusory.  
-32­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
PASH, 79 Hawai» i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252 (bold emphases added). 
We, therefore, examine each of the PASH  requirements. 
a. required by law
 In order for an agency hearing to be required by
 
law,  it may be required by (1) agency rule, (2) statute, or
 
(3) constitutional due process.  Kaniakapupu, 111 Hawai» i at 
132, 139 P.3d at 720. On direct appeal, Kaleikini argued that
 both HRS § 6E-43(c)[, quoted supra note 6,] and constitutional
 
rights mandated that [she] be granted her request for a contested
 case hearing.  
In Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Commission , 76 Hawai» i 128, 
870 P.2d 1272 (1994), this court stated: 
If the statute or rule governing the activity in
question does not mandate  a hearing prior to the
administrative agency s decision-making, the actions of the
administrative agency are not required by law   and do not
 
amount to a final decision or order in a contested case 
 
from which a direct appeal to circuit court is possible.
 
76 Hawai» i at 134, 870 P.2d at 1278. In other words, pursuant 
to HRS § 91-14, in order for proceedings before an agency to 
constitute a contested case from which an appeal can be 
maintained, the agency must be required by law to hold a hearing before a decision is rendered.  Lingle, 107 Hawai» i at 184, 111 
P.3d at 593. 
Here, HRS § 6E-43(c), as previously quoted, provides
 
that determinations [by the OIBC] may be administratively
 
appealed to a panel composed of three council chairpersons and
 three members from [BLNR] as a contested case pursuant to chapter
 
-33­  
  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
91.  In turn, HAR § 13-300-51(a), as previously quoted, states
 
that: 
When required by law, the appeals panel shall  hold a
 
contested case hearing upon timely written petition of any
person who is aggrieved by [an OIBC] determination to
preserve in place or relocate Native Hawaiian skeletal
remains and any burial goods from a previously identified
burial site and who is properly admitted as a party pursuant
to section 13-300-54.
 
(Emphases added).
 
On direct appeal, DLNR argued that the statutory scheme
 
did not mandate a contested case hearing because a
 
contested case can occur only if the BLNR chairperson
determines that one is required. The applicable rules do
not provide an absolute right to such a hearing. 
See Bush, 76 Haw. at 135, 870 P.2d at 1279. In this case,
[the BLNR chairperson], who had wide administrative
 discretion to determine the validity of a particular claim
and [was] not required  to hold a contested case hearing[,] 
[i]d., determined that based on factual and legal grounds a
contested case was not required and denied appellant s
request for one. Accordingly, a contested case could not
have occurred and did not occur.
 
(Bold emphasis added.) (Emphasis and some brackets in original.)
 
(Record citation omitted.) In support of its contention that a
 contested case can occur only if the BLNR chairperson determines
 that one is required,  DLNR points to HAR § 13-300-53, which
 states: After a determination is made by the presiding
 
officer[23] that a contested case hearing is required, the
 
written notice of hearing shall be served by the [DLNR] upon the
 
parties[.]  
DLNR, relying on Bush , further maintains that the
 
BLNR chairperson has wide administrative discretion to determine
 
the validity of a particular claim and [was] not required to hold
 
23
 HAR § 13-300-2 defines the presiding officer  as the chairperson
of the [BLNR]. 
 
-34­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
a contested case hearing.  Bush, 76 Hawai» i at 135, 870 P.2d at 
1279. In our view, DLNR s reliance on Bush is misplaced. 
In that case, the appellants, who were native Hawaiian 
lessees pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA), 
took an appeal from a denial of their request for judicial review of the Hawaiian Homes Commission s (Commission) approval of third party agreements (TPAs) between non-Hawaiian farmers and native 
Hawaiian lessees pursuant to the HHCA. 76 Hawai» i at 131, 870 
P.2d at 1275. In December 1987, some appellants appeared before 
the Commission to contest the validity of the TPAs as violative 
of the HHCA provision prohibiting transfer of the native Hawaiian lessees  interest in the land. Id. at 132, 870 P.2d at 1276. 
Upon determining that the TPAs, when properly executed, did not violate the provisions of the HHCA, the Commission caused the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) to notify all lessees 
that, if they intended to enter into a TPA, they must obtain written approval from the Commission in accordance with HAR § 10-3-35, entitled Contracts covering lease lands.  Id. Four 
days before the Commission planned to consider the written submissions of a number of lessees, the appellants, in accordance 
with HAR § 10-5-31, quoted infra , petitioned for a contested case 
hearing. Id. Ultimately, the Commission approved the TPAs 
submitted by the lessees and denied the appellants  request for a contested case hearing. Id.  at 133, 870 P.2d at 1277. The 
appellants appealed both agency decisions to the circuit court. 
-35­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
Id. Upon motion by the Commission, the circuit court dismissed
 
the appeal based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id.
 
Thereafter, the appellants timely appealed to this court. Id.
 
In determining whether a contested case was required
 
by law,  the Bush court looked to the administrative regulations
 
at issue and determined that the regulations dictate[d] the
 
appropriate procedure to follow in petitioning for a contested
 
case but at the same time accord[ed] the Commission wide
 
discretion in deciding whether to grant the petition.  Id. at
 
135, 870 P.2d at 1279. Specifically, the HAR at issue -- HAR
 
§§ 10-5-31 and 10-5-32 -- stated in relevant part that:
 
§ 10-5-31 Contested case hearing requests. (a) Any person
or agency including the commission and the department may
request a contested case hearing and shall have the right
and full opportunity to assert a claim provided that the
claim is based on a law or rule over which the commission
 has jurisdiction.
 
. . . . 
(c) Upon receipt of the complaint, the department shall
initiate an investigation of the matters contained in the
complaint. The complaint shall be presented within a
reasonable time to the commission, together with
investigator s report and staff recommendation and on the
basis thereof the commission shall determine whether
 
proceedings shall be initiated and the matter set for
 
hearing.
 
(d) It is the policy of the commission not to initiate
proceedings where the matters complained of involve a
private controversy redressable in the courts and where the
public interest is not involved, or where it is clear on the
face of the complaint that there has been no violation of
the law or any rule of the commission.
 
§ 10-5-32 Decision to hold hearing, scheduling.
 
(a) The commission shall hold a contested case hearing
whenever it finds that:
 
-36­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
(1) Such a hearing is required by Chapter 91, HRS; 
(2) There is reason to believe that a law or rule of 
the commission has been violated; 
(3) Such a hearing would be in the best interest of
one or more of the beneficiaries of the act; and 
(4) A proceeding by the commission would be in theinterest of the department. 
Id. at 135, 870 P.2d at 1279 (italics in original) (bold emphases
 
added). Based on the foregoing, the Bush  court reasoned that,
 [i]n both sections, the Commission is allocated the discretion
 
to determine whether contested case proceedings should be
 initiated and an actual hearing held. In other words, . . . the
 
allegedly aggrieved claimant has a conditional  right to a
 
contested case hearing, dependent upon the Commission s
 
evaluation of the matter.  Id. (underscored emphasis in
 
original) (bold emphasis added). Thus, the Bush  court concluded
 
that, inasmuch as [t]he Commission [was] granted wide
 
administrative discretion to determine the validity of a
 
particular claim and [was] not required  to hold a contested case
 
hearing . . . there [was] no regulatory mandate for a hearing
 
prior to the Commission s decision on TPA petitions,  and,
 
accordingly, no hearing was required by law.  Id. (underscored
 
emphasis in original) (bold emphases added). 
In determining the validity of a particular claim, 
 
the Commission was required to decide, pursuant to HAR § 10-5-32,
 whether it had reason to believe that a law or rule of the
 
[C]ommission ha[d] been violated  and that the hearing would be
 
-37­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
in the best interests of one or more of the claimants and the
 
department. However, a similar substantive determination is not
 required nor contemplated by the regulations applicable to the
 
instant case. Here, as pointed out by DLNR, HAR § 13-300-53
 
provides that, [a]fter a determination is made by the [BLNR
 chairperson] that a contested case hearing is required, the
 written notice of hearing shall be served by the department upon
 
the parties[.]  Unlike in Bush , there is nothing in the HARs
 
applicable to the case at bar that indicates the criteria upon
 
which the BLNR chairperson s determination is to be based -­
other than the regulatory mandate  that a petition for a
 contested case hearing shall  meet certain pleading
 
requirements, see  HAR § 13-300-52(b). In other words, the BLNR
 
chairperson s determination is limited to whether the procedural
 
requirements have been met, and, if so, HAR § 13-300-51 provides
 
that the appeals panel shall  hold a contested case hearing[.]  
(Emphasis added.) The lack of a regulation similar to that found
 in Bush underscores the fact that, in cases involving burial
 sites and human remains -- as we have here, -- the BLNR
 chairperson is not permitted to substitute his or her judgment
 
for that of the appeals panel with regard to the substantive
 
merits of the claimant s petition. In fact, because the
 chairperson s assessment is limited to whether procedural
 
requirements have been met, the viability and/or validity of the
 
allegations made in the petition are not at issue until properly
 
-38­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
before the appeals panel. Thus, as stated previously, DLNR s
 
reliance on Bush
 is misplaced.
 
Additionally, DLNR argues:
 
Section 6E-43(c), HRS, which permits but does not
require contested cases arising from certain burial council
decisions, states in relevant part that burial council
determinations to preserve in place or relocate previously
identified native Hawaiian burials 
may be administratively
appealed to a panel composed of three council chairpersons
and three members from the board of land and natural
 resources as a contested case pursuant to chapter 91.  
(Underscored emphasis added.) (Bold emphasis in original.) The
 
DLNR further argues that, [i]t is clear from the foregoing
 
statutory framework, as implemented by the administrative rules
 [(specifically focusing on HAR § 13-300-53, quoted supra )], that
 
a section 6E-43(c) contested case can only occur if the BLNR
 chairperson determines that one is required.  In so arguing, the
 
DLNR believes that the word may  refers to the discretionary
 authority of the BLNR chairperson to decide whether to allow an
 
administrative appeal as a contested case. Seemingly, the DLNR
 
would have us believe that, if the legislature intended to
 mandate a hearing, it would have used the word shall.  We
 disagree with DLNR s reading of the statute.
 
First, the word may,  in our view, applies to the
 
person aggrieved by the agency s determination and who has the
 discretion to decide whether to pursue an administrative appeal
 
as a contested case in the first instance. Second, we agree with
 
Kaleikini that it would have been absurd for the legislature to
 
use the word shall  because that would have meant that every
 
-39­  
    * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
council determination would be appealed. The language employed
 
gave Kaleikini the right to a contested case hearing . . . with
 all the procedural safeguards as articulated in HRS [c]hapter
 
91.  Those procedural safeguards  are found in HAR § 13-300-52,
 
quoted supra , note 8. Third, when the request for a contested
 
case hearing satisfies the procedural requirements of section 13­300-52, then, HAR § 13-300-51 -- by virtue of the use of the
 
mandatory language shall  -- requires that the appeals panel
 
hold a contested case hearing. Thus, when read together -- and
 coupled with our reading of HAR § 13-300-53, discussed supra , -­
HRS § 6E-43 and HAR § 13-300-51 confer upon an aggrieved claimant
 
-- like Kaleikini -- the right to a contested case hearing as
 
long as the written petition meets the procedural requirements of
 
HAR § 13-300-52.
 
Here, it is undisputed that Kaleikini complied with the 
requirements of HAR § 13-300-52, that is, her written petition 
was proper. As such, a contested case hearing was mandated by statute (i.e. , HRS § 6E-43) and agency rule (HAR § 13-300-51) 
and, thus, was required by law.  Kaniakapupu, 111 Hawai» i at 
132, 139 P.2d at 720 (agency hearing required by law when 
mandated by statute, rule or constitutional due process).
24 
24
 Inasmuch as we determine that a contested case hearing was mandated
by statute and agency rule, it is not necessary for us to address Kaleikini s
contention that a contested case hearing was mandated by the constitution.

The concurrence argues that,
 
[a]s the majority suggests, HAR § 13-300-53 grants the
chairperson the power to decide whether a contested case
will be convened or not. However, this authority exceeds
the scope of HRS § 6E-43, because [HAR] § 13-300-53 gives
the chairperson authority that the plain language of HRS
§ 6E-43 does not grant. There is nothing in the statute that
empowers the chairperson to exercise a veto over a request
upon so-called procedural or any other grounds.
Accordingly, the provision in HAR § 13-300-53 that affords
the chairperson the power to make such decisions is invalid
 and must be struck down.  
Concurring op. at 16 (citing Stop H-3 Ass n v. State Dep t of
 
Transp., 68 Haw. 154, 161, 706 P.2d 446, 451 (1985)) (emphasis
 
added). We disagree.
 
Preliminarily, we observe that, although an agency
 
hearing can be required by law  if required by an agency rule, 
 see Kaniakapupu, 111 Hawai» i at 132, 139 P.3d at 720, a rule that
 exceeds the scope  of its statutory authority is invalid and,
 
consequently, could not legally require  an agency hearing. 
Inasmuch as the concurrence attacks the validity of a DLNR agency
 
rule, we first turn to examine the DLNR s rule-making authority.
 
With respect to an agency s rule-making authority, this
 
court has stated that:
 
A public administrative agency possesses only such rule-
making authority as is delegated to it by the state
legislature and may only exercise this power within the
framework of the statute under which it is conferred. 
Administrative rules and regulations which exceed the scope
of the statutory enactment they were devised to implement
are invalid and must be struck down. In other words, an
administrative agency can only wield powers expressly or
implicitly granted to it by statute. 
Capua v. Weyerhaeuser , 117 Hawai» i 439, 446, 184 P.3d 191, 198

-41­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
also well-established that an administrative agency s authority 
includes those implied powers that are reasonably necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted. The reason for implied 
powers is that, as a practical matter, the legislature cannot 
foresee all the problems incidental to carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the agency.  Capua, 117 Hawai» i at 446, 
184 P.3d at 198 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). 
Here, the DLNR s authority to make rules related to the
 
historic preservation of burial grounds is found in HRS § 6E-43.5
 (2009), which provides in relevant part that [t]he [DLNR], in
 
consultation with the [burial] councils, office of Hawaiian
 affairs, representatives of development and large property owner
 
interests, and appropriate Hawaiian organizations . . . shall
 
adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary to carry out the
 
purposes of this section.  (Emphases added). The purposes of
 
this section,  i.e. , HRS chapter 6E, are set forth in HRS § 6E-1,
 
as follows:
 
The Constitution of the State of Hawai »i recognizes the
value of conserving and developing the historic and cultural
property within the State for the public good. . . . The legislature further declares that it is in the public
interest to engage in a comprehensive program of historic
preservation at all levels of government to promote the useand conservation of such property for the education,inspiration, pleasure, and enrichment of its citizens. The 
legislature further declares that it shall be the publicpolicy of this State to provide leadership in preserving,restoring, and maintaining history and cultural property, toensure the administration of such historic and cultural property in a spirit of stewardship and trusteeship for

(Emphases added.) Accordingly, the plain language of HRS
 
§ 6E-43.5 authorizes the DLNR to promulgate rules that are: 
(1) in accordance with HRS chapter 91 (governing administrative
 
procedure); and (2) necessary to implement or carry out  the
 
purposes of HRS chapter 6E, including engag[ing] in a
 comprehensive program of historic preservation at all levels of
 government  and/or promot[ing] the use and conservation  of
 
historical and cultural property. We now examine HAR § 13-300-53
 
in light of the DLNR s statutory rule-making authority.
 
Title 13, subtitle 13, chapter 300 of the HAR,
 
promulgated by the DLNR, sets forth the rules of practice and
 
procedure relating to burial sites and human remains.  HAR
 
§ 13-300-53, entitled notice of hearing,  provides that,
 
[a]fter a determination is made by the presiding
officer that a contested case hearing is required, the
written notice of hearing shall be served by the
department upon the parties in accordance with section
91-9.5, HRS, and shall be served on all persons
admitted as a party at their last recorded address not
less than fifteen days prior to the beginning of the
contested case hearing.
 
(Emphasis added.) As indicated supra , the BLNR chairperson s
 
authority to determine whether a contested case hearing is
 
required is limited to whether a party has met the procedural
 
requirements set forth in HAR § 13-300-52. Stated differently,
 
the chairperson, in making his or her determination, examines
 
only whether a party has complied with procedural requirements
 for filing an administrative appeal from an OIBC determination. 
-43­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
If so, then HAR § 13-300-51 mandates a contested case hearing and
 
such hearing is, thus, required by law.  
A review of HRS chapter 91 demonstrates that HAR
 
§ 13-300-53 and our interpretation thereof do not conflict with
 the provisions of such chapter. Further, a contested case
 hearing that is required by law  when a party complies with the
 procedural dictates of HAR § 13-300-52 enables parties to present
 
the merits of their appeal. It follows that such process helps
 
ensure that parties are able to present their claims regarding
 the preservation of burial grounds and other historic property in
 
an expeditious manner, often in situations where time is of the
 essence, as was the case here because Kaleikini was seeking to
 
preserve the iwi and prevent their imminent removal. As a
 
result, HAR § 13-300-53 effectively creates an appellate system
 that is consistent with the preservation and enhancement of
 
historic and cultural property  and, thus, carries out  the
 purposes of HRS chapter 6E. Consequently, it does not exceed the
 DLNR s rule-making authority under HRS § 6E-43.5. We now
 determine whether HAR § 13-300-53 exceeds the scope  of HRS
 § 6E-43(c), as the concurrence contends. 
As indicated supra , HRS § 6E-43(c) provides that:
 
Council determinations may be administratively appealed to a
panel composed of three council chairpersons and three
members of the [BLNR] as a contested case pursuant to
chapter 91. In addition to the six members, the chairperson
of the [BLNR] shall preside over the contested case and vote
only in the event of a tie. 
-44­  
 * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
In other words, HRS § 6E-43(c) provides for the right to
 
administratively appeal a council determination to a panel.
 However, it does not set forth a specific process for initiating
 
and conducting such an appeal. As stated above, the legislature
 cannot foresee all the problems incidental to carrying out the
 duties and responsibilities of the agency.  As a result,
 agencies -- such as the DLNR in this case -- have the power to
 
make rules that are reasonably necessary  to carry out  its
 
duties. Based on such rule-making power, the DLNR appropriately
 promulgated administrative rules necessary to implement the
 
statutory right to appeal by establishing procedural rules to
 initiate and conduct an administrative appeal to the OIBC,
 
including, inter alia, HAR § 13-300-53. 
As previously concluded, the determination of the
 
chairperson pursuant to HAR § 13-300-53 is limited to an
 examination of whether a party has complied with the procedural
 requirements for submitting an appeal pursuant to HAR
 § 13-300-52. Indeed, the chairperson does not decide or even
 address the substantive merits of a party s appeal. As a result,
 HAR § 13-300-53 merely furnishes part of the process for
 
appealing a council determination and ascertaining whether such
 
hearing is required by law.  Further, the chairperson s
 determination does not: (1) abrogate or alter a litigant s
 
substantive right to appeal as set forth in HRS § 6E-43(c);
 
(2) deprive the panel of their authority to adjudge the merits of
 
-45­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
the appeal; or (3) otherwise displace the role and structure of
 
the appellate panel laid out in HRS § 6E-43. Thus, HAR
 § 13-300-53 does not exceed the scope of HRS § 6E-43,  and,
 
instead, carries out  a function of the administrative appellate
 
process, as authorized by HRS § 6E-43.5(c), quoted supra . 
Therefore, the concurrence s argument that HAR § 13-300-53 is
 invalid and must be struck down  is unavailing. See Concurring
 
op. at 16.
 
The concurrence, however, disagrees with our conclusion 
that HAR § 13-300-53 does not exceed the scope of HRS § 6E-43  
and, relying on Haole v. State , 111 Hawai» i 144, 140 P.3d 377 
(2006), argues that, [b]ecause the legislature specifically 
defined the role of the chairperson in HRS § 6E-43, this court, 
as well as the DLNR[,] must give effect to the language of the statute itself.  Concurring op. at 21 (citations and internal 
brackets omitted). 
It appears that the concurrence relies upon Haole  to
 
essentially assert that the role of the chairperson -- as defined
 in HRS § 6E-43 -- is a limited one, and that, because no other
 role for the chairperson was set forth in HRS § 6E-43, the
 
chairperson has no further authority outside of presiding over
 
the contested case and voting in the event of a tie.  HRS
 § 6E-43. We disagree. 
The concurrence correctly observes that the Haole  court
 
examined an administrative rule imposing a regulatory duty on
 
-46­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
owners and operators conducting unloading activities on state 
piers  to defend and indemnify the State of Hawai» i in order to 
determine whether such rule was authorized by the statutes 
governing the Department of Transportation (DOT). Haole , 111 
Hawai» i at 146, 140 P.3d at 379. In so doing, the Haole court 
looked to and applied the test for reviewing an agency s 
construction of a statute which it administers  set forth in 
Orca Bay Seafoods v. Northwest Truck Sales, Inc. , 32 F.3d 433 
(9th Cir. 1994) -- the first question of which is whether 
Congress[, i.e., the legislature,] has directly spoken to the 
precise question at issue.  Haole , 111 Hawai» i at 155, 140 P.3d 
at 388. 
Looking to the first question of the test, the Haole
 
court observed that the legislature had spoken to the issue  of
 State liability when it enacted the State Tort Liability Act,
 
which provided in part that the State is generally liable for
 actual damages caused by the negligence of its employees in the
 same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under
 like circumstances.  Id. at 151, 140 P.3d at 384 (quoting HRS
 
§ 662-2 (1993)). It further observed that [t]his court has
 
consistently held that private parties may contract to indemnify
 
the indemnitee for the indemnitee s own negligence but there must
 be a clear and unequivocal  assumption of liability by one party
 
for the other party s negligence.  Id. (citations omitted). 
-47­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
In examining whether the language of the DOT s
 
governing statutes authorized the State to impose a duty of
 
indemnification via statute (instead of contractually imposing
 
such a duty), the Haole  court determined that the DOT s authority
 
was specifically defined in the governing statutes, and that such
 
statutes did not explicitly state that DOT s rule-making
 authority includes the power to impose a duty of
 
indemnification.  Id. at 154, 140 P.3d at 387. With regard to
 
the DOT s implied powers, the Haole  court concluded that,
 
because: (1) the DOT s authority is specifically defined by
 statute; (2) the legislature had spoken to the issue of State
 liability; and (3) the DOT could contract for the indemnity that
 
it was attempting to impose in an administrative rule, the DOT
 
was not permitted to bypass the general requirement that parties
 (in this case, the State) seeking to shift liability to another
 
. . . must secure the clear and unequivocal agreement of that
 party to assume the liability of another.  Id. at 155-56, 140
 
P.3d at 388-89 (citation omitted). Consequently, the Haole  court
 
held, in relevant part, that the statutes governing the DOT do
 not explicitly or implicitly authorize the DOT to issue
 
administrative rules exonerating the State from the negligence of
 
its employees.  Id. at 160, 140 P.3d at 393 (footnote omitted).
 
Here, HRS § 6E-43 defines the role of the chairperson,
 
just as the DOT statutes defined the powers of the DOT. Such
 defined powers indicate that the chairperson does not have
 
-48­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
explicit power, pursuant to HRS § 6E-43, to examine the
 
procedural requirements for requesting a contested case hearing
 -- just as the DOT did not have explicit power under the statute
 
to promulgate an administrative rule which imposed a duty to
 
indemnify the State. However, the language of HRS § 6E-43 does
 not limit the BLNR chairperson s authority to make a procedural
 
determination, and the legislature has not spoken to the issue
 
such that the DLNR is precluded from using its implied powers to
 
delegate such authority. Indeed, unlike the State Tort Liability
 Act in Haole  (in which the legislature had directly spoken to the
 
issue of State liability), there is no statute or statutory
 
scheme that directly speaks to  the chairperson s authority to
 
assess whether a contested case hearing is required. Further, as
 
previously discussed, the statutes are silent as to the proper
 process for initiating and conducting an administrative appeal,
 
and, thus, do not limit the DLNR s implicit authority to
 promulgate rules setting forth such an appellate process. 
Consequently, no intent or policy of the legislature precluded
 the DLNR from exercising its implied powers to promulgate HAR
 § 13-300-53 and grant the chairperson authority to determine
 
whether a contested case hearing is required. Accordingly, Haole
 
is not only distinguishable from the instant case, but also
 
contrary to the concurrence. We now turn to examine whether the
 
chairperson s authority under HAR § 13-300-53 directly conflicts
 
with the plain language of HRS § 6E-43. 
-49­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
The relevant language of HRS § 6E-43, i.e., that the
 
chairperson of the [BLNR] shall preside over the contested case
 
and vote only in the event of a tie,  precludes the chairperson
 
from making a substantive decision as to the merits of a party s
 
contested case, except in the event of a tie.  As discussed at
 length supra , HAR § 13-300-53, when read in conjunction with
 
other relevant administrative rules, gives the chairperson the
 
authority to make an assessment of only the procedural
 
requirements set forth in HAR § 13-300-52(a), and such assessment
 
is entirely unrelated to the merits. Consequently, the authority
 
granted to the chairperson in HAR § 13-300-53 does not conflict
 with or usurp the role of the chairperson defined in HRS § 6E-43,
 
nor does it contradict the plain language or intent of the
 
statute. 
Based on the foregoing, we maintain that the DLNR had
 
implicit authority to issue administrative rules  that provide a
 
procedure for requesting and obtaining a contested case hearing,
 including HAR § 13-300-53, which, in turn, permits the BLNR
 chairperson to make the determination whether a contested case
 hearing is required. Accordingly, the concurrence s argument
 
that the role of the chairperson defined in HRS § 6E-43 is the
 
end of the matter  is incorrect.
 
We turn next to examine whether the requested contested
 
case hearing would have determined the rights, duties, and
 
-50­  
 
 * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
privileges of specific parties.  PASH, 79 Hawai» i at 431, 903 
P.2d at 1252. 
b. rights, duties, and privileges
 
Inasmuch as no contested case hearing was held, but, as
 
discussed above, was required by HRS § 6E-43 and HAR § 13-300-51
 
the issue here is whether the hearing, had it been held, would
 have determined the rights, duties, and privileges of specific
 
parties.  Id. In PASH, this court stated that, with regard to
 
whether a hearing would determine the rights, duties, and
 
privileges of specific parties, its inquiry [was] properly
 
directed at the party whose application was under consideration.  
Id. at 432, 903 P.2d at 1253. Likewise, in Puna Geothermal, this
 
court stated that:
 
The public hearings held by the DOH were proceedings
in which PGV sought to have the legal rights, duties or
privileges of land in which it held an interest declared
over the objections of other landowners and residents of 
Puna. Mahuiki v. Planning Comm n , 65 Haw. 506, 513, 654
P.2d 874, 879 (1982) (concluding that this characteristic is
 
an obvious  element of a contested case hearing); see also
 
Town v. Land Use Comm n , 55 Haw. 538, 548, 524 P.2d 84, 91
(1974) (holding that adjacent property owner has a property
interest in the amendment of a district boundary). Thus,
the DOH hearings were contested case[s]  because they were
proceeding[s] in which the legal rights, duties or
privileges of specific parties were required by law to be
determined after an opportunity for agency hearing.   HRS §
91-1(5).
 
77 Hawai» i at 68, 881 P.2d at 1214. Accordingly, the relevant 
inquiry in the instant case, as in PASH, is whether a contested 
case hearing would have determined the rights, duties, or privileges of GGP. 
The concurrence claims that:
 
-51­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
The majority decision today, coupled with the majority s
decision in Kaniakapupu , creates different standards for
determining whether an agency action is a contested case.
Thus, on one hand, if there is a procedural vehicle
for any party or interested person to obtain a contested
case[,]  then Kaniakapupu  does not apply and the analysis as
set forth in the majority s opinion here rests on whether
 
the hearing, had it been held, would have determined the
rights, duties, and privileges of specific parties. 
Majority opinion at 51. If so, then the court has
jurisdiction under HRS chapter 91. On the other hand, if
there is no such procedural vehicle  for obtaining a
contested case, then Kaniakapupu  applies and the court lacks
jurisdiction because there was no contested case hearing,
even though, had the hearing been held , the hearing would
have determined the rights, duties, and privileges of
specific parties.  Kaniakapupu , 111 Hawai
»i at 134, 139
P.3d at 722. Consequently, the foregoing standard, even if
the hearing, had it been held, would have determined the
rights, duties, and privileges of specific parties, the
court lacks jurisdiction pursuant to HRS chapter 91.
 
Concurring op. at 36-37 (footnotes omitted). However, the only
 
support provided by the concurrence for such position is the
 
dissenting opinion in Kaniakapupu, which is not binding on this
 
court and, as importantly, not the law in this jurisdiction. 
Turning to the relevant inquiry whether a contested
 
case hearing in this case would have determined the rights,
 
duties, or privileges of GGP, we observe that OIBC s approval of
 
GGP s burial treatment plan (and DLNR s subsequent approval of
 
such plan without a contested case hearing) implicated GGP s use
 of its project site because HAR § 13-300-33 (2009) prohibits the
 [i]ntentional
 removal of human skeletal remains or burial goods
 
from a previously identified Native Hawaiian burial site . . .
 
until a determination to relocate is made by the council[.]  
Moreover, the approval or disapproval of the burial treatment
 
plan determined what GGP s duties were with respect to the iwi
 
-52­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
discovered on the project site. Accordingly, had a contested
 
case hearing been held, it would have determined the rights,
 duties, or privileges of GGP. 
The concurrence contends that:
 
The chairperson s review of a petition for a contested case
hearing is analogous to the LUC s entertainment of theappellant s motion for order to show cause in Kaniakapupu  in 
that both were essentially threshold motions  that occurredbefore a contested case was conducted. Applying themajority s reasoning in Kaniakapupu, the chairperson s
denial of a contested case did not constitute a contested case for the purposes of obtaining judicial review pursuant
to HRS § 91-14(a),  111 Hawai
»i at 134, 139 P.3d at 722,
and, hence, the requirement in HRS § 91-14 that the order
appealed from arise from a contested case hearing, had not
been met[,]  id. at 131, 139 P.3d at 719. 
Concurring op. at 30 (internal brackets omitted). Consequently,
 
the concurrence argues that, 
[i]f the provision in HAR
 
§ 13-300-53 regarding the chairperson s authority is valid, as
 
the majority holds (and which I believe it is not, as indicated
 previously), then, pursuant to the majority in Kaniakapupu , the
 
court in the instant case lacked subject matter jurisdiction
 
under HRS chapter 91.  Id. at 30-31 (emphasis in original)
 
(footnote omitted). However, the concurrence misconstrues our
 characterization of the BLNR chairperson s role in the
 administrative appeal process and, as such, incorrectly
 
analogizes Kaniakapupu  to the instant case. 
In Kaniakapupu , it was undisputed that, in order for
 
the petitioner-Hui to obtain a contested case hearing, they had
 
to first file an OSC motion, request a hearing on that motion,
 
and meet their burden of proof in demonstrating that an order to
 
-53­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
show cause was required. Kaniakapupu, 111 Hawai» i at 127-128, 
139 P.3d at 715-716. Indeed, the parties acknowledged that only 
if the LUC grants a motion and issues an order to show cause 
would a contested case be conducted.  Id.  at 136, 139 P.3d at 
724. Finally, the Hui admitted that there was no procedure for
 
them -- or any interested party -- to directly request or obtain
 
a contested case hearing in their case. Id. at 137, 139 P.3d at
 
725. Thus, the OSC motion filed by the Hui and subsequent motion
 
hearing were the only procedural devices  that could possibly have
 
provided them with a contested case hearing that would determine
 
the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties. 
Consequently, the Hui s OSC motion constituted a threshold
 
motion,  and the motion hearing provided the only procedural
 
vehicle  to obtain a contested case hearing. 
In the instant case, however, there was a statutory and
 
agency rule which allowed Kaleikini to directly request and
 
obtain a contested case hearing -- i.e., HRS § 6E-43(c) and HAR
 
§ 13-300-51. Further, as discussed supra  at section C.2.b, we
 
determined that, unlike the motion hearing in Kaniakapupu, a
 
contested case hearing -- had it been held -- would have
 
determined the rights, duties, or privileges of GGP. 
 
Additionally, we determined that a party can meet the
 required by law  element of HAR § 13-300-51 by complying with
 the procedural requirements set forth in HAR § 13-300-52, quoted
 
supra, and, pursuant to HAR § 13-300-53, the BLNR chairperson is
 
-54­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
the designated officer to determine whether such procedural
 
requirements have been met. Thus, the chairperson s
 determination is to ascertain whether a party seeking an appeal
 
has met the required by law  element of HAR § 13-300-51. 
Consequently, such determination by the chairperson -- unlike the
 LUC s denial of the Hui s OSC motion in Kaniakapupu  -- does not
 
constitute a threshold motion  to obtain a hearing that
 
determines the rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties. 
Accordingly, the instant case is clearly distinguishable from
 Kaniakapupu . 
Moreover, if the chairperson s determination whether a
 
hearing was required by law  constitutes a threshold motion or
 procedural vehicle,  as the concurrence contends, then any
 
inquiry as to whether a contested case hearing is required by
 
law  prior to holding the hearing would be a threshold  inquiry
 
that does not constitute a contested case for the purposes of
 obtaining judicial review pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a).  Thus,
 under the concurrence s interpretation, a party would never have
 the ability to appeal the adverse determination that a hearing
 was not  required by law,  and any agency could arbitrarily and
 
capriciously deny a party a hearing without being subject to
 judicial review of such denial. Such a result is contrary to
 fundamental notions of fairness and justice and abrogates the
 
important interest in giving parties the opportunity to appeal
 
adverse rulings. 
-55­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
In sum, we are unpersuaded by the concurrence s attempt
 
to analogize the instant case to Kaniakapupu. As a result, the
 
concurrence s contention that the court lacked subject matter
 
jurisdiction under HRS chapter 91, pursuant to the majority
 
opinion in Kaniakapupu   is wholly without merit.
 
3. Final Decision and Order
 
The second prong of the PASH  requirements calls for an 
examination whether the agency s action . . . represents a 
final decision and order,  or a preliminary ruling  such that deferral of review would deprive the claimant of adequate 
relief.  PASH , 79 Hawai» i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252. Kaleikini 
argues that this court has repeatedly found that the denial of a 
request for a contested case hearing (or to participate in one) 
is a sufficiently final decision for judicial review.  (Citing 
Puna Geothermal , PASH, and In re Hawai» i Gov t Employees  Ass n, 
63 Haw. 85, 88-89, 621 P.2d 361, 364 (1980)). We agree. 
As previously stated, this court, in PASH held that the 
circuit court properly exercised jurisdiction over an agency 
appeal where the agency denied a request by the appellants to participate in a contested case hearing. 79 Hawai» i at 431-33, 
903 P.2d at 1252-54. Here, Kaleikini requested a contested case hearing, which DLNR denied. The denial of Kaleikini s request 
constituted a final decision and order  inasmuch as it ended the litigation. Accordingly, this prong of the PASH  requirements is 
met. 
-56­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
4. Applicable Agency Rules
 
The third step requires a determination whether the 
claimant . . . followed the applicable agency rules and, 
therefore, [was] involved in  the contested case[.]  PASH , 79 
Hawai» i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252. Kaleikini states that she
 followed all applicable agency rules.  More specifically,
 Kaleikini asserts that, 
[a]s in PASH  and [Puna Geothermal], Kaleikini testified
against the authorization to relocate the iwi. As in PASH
 
and [Puna Geothermal], Kaleikini filed a written request for
a contested case hearing. Kaleikini s petition was timely
filed and included all the relevant information requested.
Kaleikini followed the rules by requesting a hearing on a
contested matter in her October 12, 2006 letter[.]
 
As quoted supra  note 8, HAR § 13-300-52 governs the 
procedures that must be followed in requesting a contested case 
hearing. Our review of Kaleikini s October 12, 2006 letter, 
reveals that she complied with HAR § 13-300-52 inasmuch as her letter contained statements regarding: (1) the legal authority by which appeal is requested, i.e. , HRS § 6E-43 and HAR 
§§ 13-300-51 and 13-300-52; (2) the council determination being appealed and the date of the determination, i.e., the September 13, 2006 decision to relocate the iwi at the Ward Village Shops 
Project; (3) the nature of the interest that may be adversely 
affected by the council determination, i.e. , Kaleikini s rights 
under article XII, section 7 of the Hawai» i constitution and her 
rights as a cultural decedent; (4) the relevant facts and issues 
-57­  * * * FOR PUBLICATION  * * * 
in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
raised; and (5) the relief being sought. HAR § 13-300-52. Thus,
 
Kaleikini complied with the applicable agency rules.
 
5. Standing
 
The final prong requires that the claimant s legal 
interests must have been injured -- i.e., the claimant must have 
standing to appeal. PASH , 79 Hawai» i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252. 
Kaleikini argues that she has standing as a Native Hawaiian and as a cultural descendent of the iwi.  
As indicated above, Kaleikini s legal interests stem 
from her cultural and religious beliefs regarding the protection 
of the iwi. The HAR at issue here specifically provide standing to cultural descendant[s],  such as Kaleikini. Additionally, 
the Hawai» i constitution -- article XII, section 7 -- protects 
such rights. Throughout the instant litigation, Kalekini has averred that her cultural and religious beliefs require her to ensure that the iwi is left undisturbed and that the OIBC s decision, allowing GGP to disinter the iwi, has caused her cultural and religious injury. As such, we believe Kaleikini has 
alleged sufficient facts upon which this court can determine she has standing. Accordingly, Kaleikini has also met this final 
prong of the requirements set forth in PASH . 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, we hold that, although
 
Kaleikini s appeal was moot, it fell within the public interest
 exception to the mootness doctrine. We additionally hold that a

in West s Hawai » i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
contested case hearing was (1) required by law and (2) would have
 
determined the rights, duties, and privileges of specific
 parties. Further, we conclude that: (1) DLNR s denial of
 
Kaleikini s request for a contested case hearing represented a
 
final decision and order ; (2) Kaleikini followed the applicable
 agency rules and, therefore, was involved in  the contested
 case; and (3) Kaleikini s legal interests were injured -- i.e.,
 
she has standing to appeal. Accordingly, we hold that the
 circuit court erred in dismissing Kaleikini s agency appeal for a
 lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, we vacate the
 
ICA s order dismissing Kaleikini s appeal for mootness and remand
 the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent
 
with this opinion.
