MEMORANDUM OPINION

(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy and Recktenwald, JJ.
and Acoba, J., Dissenting)

Petitioner-Defendant-Appellant Arthur Vinhaca

( Vinhaca ) filed a timely application for a writ of certiorari

seeking review of the judgment of the Intermediate Court of

Appeals (ICA) filed May 22, 2009, entered pursuant to the summary

disposition order filed April 29, 2009 in State v. Vinhaca , No.

28571 (App. Apr. 29, 2009) (SDO) which affirmed the April 30,

2007 judgment of the circuit court of the fifth circuit.
1 This

court accepted certiorari on September 30, 2009, and oral

argument was held on November 19, 2009. Vinhaca asserts that the

ICA gravely erred by affirming the circuit court s decision to

allow the introduction of preliminary hearing testimony after

holding that one of the witnesses was unavailable.2 For the

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
following reasons, we affirm the ICA s May 22, 2009, judgment on

appeal.

I. BACKGROUND

The State of Hawai» i ( the prosecution ) charged 
Vinhaca with nine counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in

violation of Hawai» i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732 (Supp. 
2008),
3 one count of Assault in the Second Degree in violation of

HRS § 707-711(1)(d) (1993),4 five counts of Abuse of Family and

2(...continued)
prosecutorial misconduct. Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, we conclude that these arguments are without merit.

3 HRS § 707-732 provides in relevant part:

(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in
the third degree if:

....

(b) The person knowingly subjects to sexual
contact another person who is less than fourteen years
old or causes such a person to have sexual contact
with the person;
(c) The person knowingly engages in sexual
contact with a person who is at least fourteen years
old but less than sixteen years old or causes the
minor to have sexual contact with the person; provided
that:

(i) The person is not less than five years
older than the minor; and
(ii) The person is not legally married to
the minor[.]

4
 At the time of the charged offense, HRS § 707-711(1)(d) provided
in relevant part:

(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the
second degree if:

....

(d) The person intentionally or knowingly causes
bodily injury to another person with a dangerous
instrument[.] 
 
2

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Household Members in violation of HRS § 709-906 (Supp. 2009),5

and two counts of Sexual Assault in the First Degree in violation

of HRS § 707-730(1)(b) (Supp. 2008),6 arising from Vinhaca s

alleged abuse of his two minor daughters, Daughter 1 and Daughter

2, between 2003 and 2005. Both Daughters testified at the
 
preliminary hearing, but only Daughter 2 appeared at trial.

The daughters testified at the July 25, 2007

preliminary hearing as follows. Daughter 2 testified that when
 
she was fourteen, Vinhaca touched her breasts and her private
 
parts.  She testified Vinhaca used to twist [her] nipples  with

his hand and used to make [his daughters] whistle and he

wouldn t want to stop until [they] whistle[d].  Rebecca Seiter,
 
Daughter 2 s therapist, testified that Daughter 2 told her

Vinhaca often did that when he was upset with [Daughter 2 s]

mother, so that she would hear the whistle and know that her

daughter was being hurt or touched.  This happened about three

times a week  when Daughter 2 was fourteen.  She also testified

5 HRS § 709-906(1) provides:

(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in
concert, to physically abuse a family or household member .
 
. . . 
 
6

HRS § 707-730(1)(b) provides:

(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in
the first degree if:

....

(b) The person knowingly engages in sexual
penetration with another person who is less than
fourteen years old[.]

3

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that Vinhaca touched and rubbed her vagina through her clothes 
and sucked her breasts. Vinhaca would make [her] lay inside the 
bed with him  and would rub her vagina with his penis through her 
clothes. He also hit her over the head with a large steel wrench because she did not clean his tools well enough. 
Daughter 1 testified that, when she was eleven, Vinhaca

would pinch her nipples until she whistled to stop. This

happened every day  until she moved out of Vinhaca s house. She

also testified that Vinhaca touched and rubbed her vagina with

his hand and would undress, lay on her, and touch his penis to

her vagina. She testified that two or three times  he put his

penis into her vaginal opening. She also testified that he put
 
his fingers in her genital opening, and put his mouth on her

genital opening.

On January 22, 2007, the prosecution moved to sever the

trial because it could not locate Daughter 1. The declaration of

the prosecuting attorney stated that in preparing for this
 
trial, Counsel learned that [Daughter 1] is on runaway status. 

The declaration also stated that [a]s of now, it is doubtful

that [Daughter 1] will be available for trial on February 5,

2007. 

On February 1, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing

on the prosecution s motion to sever. At the hearing, the
 
4

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prosecuting attorney stated:

THE COURT: Okay. And, once again, the basis of this
motion is the problem with a witness, with the complaining
witness.

[PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]: Yes, and so your Honor is up
to date on that issue, we did -- the witness that we re
having difficulty with is a minor. We have actually served
the guardian with a subpoena to bring that minor to court.
However, we have been informed that she is not being [sic]
able to be located right now.
We have an understanding where she is, but it appears
that she s kind of in hiding. We have had our investigator
go out and try to find her himself, but for your Honor s
knowledge, we have actually served the person we needed to
serve, which is the CWS . . . worker.

The motion to sever was denied and Vinhaca s trial

began on February 5, 2007. Daughter 1 did not appear at trial,
 
and Daughter 2 essentially recanted the testimony she had given

at the preliminary hearing. The prosecution requested that the
 
circuit court play the tape of Daughter 2 s preliminary hearing

testimony for the jury. The circuit court granted this request
 
and Daughter 2 s preliminary hearing testimony was played for the

jury.

After Daughter 2 s preliminary hearing testimony was

played, Karla Huerta ( Huerta ), a social services worker for the

Department of Human Services ( DHS ) testified about the efforts

made to locate Daughter 1. She testified that on January 25,
 
2007, she was served with a subpoena to bring [Daughter 1] to
 
court for this trial[.]  She testified that she was unable to

bring Daughter 1 to trial because Daughter 1 was on the run.  
 Daughter 1 first ran away on October 31, 2006, and has been

5

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
picked up on four different occasions, but has continued to run 
away from the program.  Daughter 1 was last picked up on 
January 16th, and then she ran away within an hour of that time.  
Huerta testified that in the several days before trial

she contacted the juvenile delinquent program to help see if

they ve heard of anything  and that they printed something in
 
the newspaper.  She went to Daughter 1 s mother s home, where
 
Daughter 1 has resided on numerous occasions, contacted the

schools[,]  and talked to many people in the community 
 
including police officers. She called police officers to see if
 
they have seen or heard of her recently because of this court
 
hearing.  On cross-examination, she testified that when the
 
sheriff served her, she told him that Daughter 1 was not with

her. She also testified that prior to being served, she could

not locate Daughter 1.

The prosecution then requested that the circuit court

play the tape of Daughter 1 s preliminary hearing testimony for

the jury. The circuit court granted the request over the
 
objection of the defendant.

At the close of trial, upon agreement by the

prosecution and Vinhaca, the circuit court dismissed five counts.

The jury found Vinhaca guilty of one count of first-degree sexual

assault, in violation of HRS § 707-730(1)(b) (Supp. 2008); one

6

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
count of first-degree attempted sexual assault, in violation of 
HRS §§ 707-730(1)(b) and 705-500 (1993); one count of 
second-degree assault, in violation of HRS § 707-711(1)(d) 
(1993); and eight counts of third-degree sexual assault, in violation of HRS § 707-732 (Supp. 2008). 
Vinhaca appealed to the ICA asserting that the circuit

court s decision to allow the introduction of Daughter 1 s

preliminary hearing testimony violated the Confrontation Clause

because the prosecution failed to prove Daughter 1 s

unavailability. The ICA concluded that the admission of

Daughter 1 s preliminary hearing testimony did not violate

Vinhaca s right of confrontation.  Vinhaca, SDO at 4. The ICA

held that the circuit court did not err in finding that Daughter

1 was unavailable  because the State presented evidence that it

had served Daughter 1 s legal custodian, Karla Lynn Huerta, a

social worker for the Department of Human Services, with a

subpoena to bring Daughter 1 to trial.  Id. at 5. The ICA also

relied on Huerta s testimony that she was unable to comply with
 
the subpoena because Daughter 1 had run away and Daughter 1 s

whereabouts were unknown.  Id. The ICA noted that Daughter 1

ran away three weeks before trial and that Huerta had been unable

to locate Daughter 1. Id. Huerta was unable to locate Daughter

1 despite efforts that included providing pictures of Daughter 1

7

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to the juvenile delinquency program and having them publish a 
request for assistance in locating Daughter 1 in a newspaper; 
looking for Daughter 1 at her mother s home; and contacting 
Daughter 1 s school, people in the community, and the police in an effort to ascertain her whereabouts.  Id. The ICA concluded 
that the circuit court did not err in finding that Daughter 1 was unavailable, and affirmed the April 30, 2007, judgment of the 
circuit court. Id. at 7. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW

A. Certiorari

The acceptance or rejection of an application for writ

of certiorari is discretionary. HRS § 602-59(a) (Supp. 2009). 
 
In deciding whether to accept an application, this court reviews 
the decisions of the ICA for (1) grave errors of law or of fact or (2) obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the ICA with 
that of the supreme court, federal decisions, or its own decisions and whether the magnitude of such errors or inconsistencies dictate the need for further appeal.  State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai» i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (citing 
HRS § 602-59(b)). 
B. Violation of Right To Confrontation

Whether the prosecution has adequately shown the
 unavailability  of a witness-for the purpose of satisfying the

8

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
confrontation clauses of the United States and Hawai» i 
Constitutions-is, at the first level of analysis, a question of 
fact for the trial court to decide, involving a determination of 
the nature of the prosecution s good faith  efforts to secure the witness s presence at trial.  State v. Lee , 83 Hawai» i 267, 
273, 925 P.2d 1091, 1097 (1996). Findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. Id. (citing State v. 
Ganal, 81 Hawai» i 358, 368, 917 P.2d 370, 380 (1996); Tachibana 
v. State, 79 Hawai» i 226, 231, 900 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1995); State 
v. Furutani, 76 Hawai» i 172, 179, 873 P.2d 51, 58 (1994)). A 
finding of fact is clearly erroneous when despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.   
Id. (quoting Ganal, 81 Hawai» i at 368, 917 P.2d at 380; 
Tachibana , 79 Hawai» i at 231, 900 P.2d at 1298; Furutani, 76 
Hawai» i at 179, 873 P.2d at 58). 
At the second level of analysis, we ask whether the
 
facts as found amount to a legally adequate good faith effort to

confront the defendant with his accusers. This is a question of

federal and/or state constitutional law, and we answer it by

exercising our own independent constitutional judgment [based]
 
on the facts of the case.   Id. (some internal quotation marks

omitted) (quoting Crosby v. State Dep t of Budget & Fin. , 76

9

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai» i 332, 341, 876 P.2d 1300, 1309 (1994)). In other words,
 application of constitutional principles to the facts as found . 
. . requires us to examine the entire record and make an 
independent determination . . . based upon that review and the totality of the circumstances[.]   Id. (quoting State v. Hoey, 
77 Hawai» i 17, 32, 881 P.2d 504, 519 (1994)). 
III. DISCUSSION

A.		The ICA Did Not Gravely Err By Affirming the Trial Court s
Determination That Daughter 1 Was Unavailable.

In his application, Vinhaca asserts that the ICA

gravely erred by holding that Daughter 1 was unavailable for

trial. He asserts that the admission of prior testimony violated

the Confrontation Clause.
7

Preliminary hearing testimony from an unavailable 
witness is testimonial hearsay. State v. Fields , 115 Hawai» i 
503, 513, 168 P.3d 955, 965 (2007) (quoting Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 64, 68 (2004)). Testimonial hearsay is admissible only where the declarant is unavailable, and only 
where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine  
7 In his application, Vinhaca did not specify which constitution his
confrontation claim is based upon. This court has stated that the
 confrontation clause contained within article I, section 14 of the Hawai »i 
Constitution is virtually identical to the confrontation clause of the sixthamendment to the United States Constitution.  State v. Fields, 115 Hawai
»i 
503, 517, 168 P.3d 955, 969 (2007). However, in State v. Lee, 83 Hawai »i 267,
278, 925 P.2d 1091, 1102 (1996), this court adopted a test for unavailabilitynot yet endorsed by the United States Supreme Court. As discussed below, we
conclude that under either test, the admission of Daughter 1 s preliminaryhearing testimony did not violate Vinhaca s right to confront Daughter 1. 
10

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[the declarant] about the statement.  Id. (quoting Crawford, 541

U.S. at 59).
 
In determining whether the declarant is unavailable,

the United States Supreme Court has held that the prosecution

must prove that it made a good faith  effort to secure the
 
presence of the unavailable witness. Ohio v. Roberts , 448 U.S.

56, 74 (1980) (quoting Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 724-25

(1968)), overruled on other grounds by Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60­
61, 68-69. The State s obligation to make a good faith effort is
 context-specific . . . .  Hamilton v. Morgan , 474 F.3d 854,

858-59 (6th Cir. 2007); see also  30B Michael Graham, Federal

Practice & Procedure § 7072 at 736-40 (2006) ( Whether the

government has shown good faith in attempting to first locate and

second procure the witness  attendance by process or voluntarily

by reasonable means must be determined on a case-by-case basis

after careful review of the particular facts and circumstances. )

(emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). For instance, the Supreme
 
Court explained that:

The law does not require the doing of a futile act.
Thus, if no possibility of procuring the witness exists (as,
for example, the witness  intervening death), good faith 
demands nothing of the prosecution. But if there is a

possibility, albeit remote, that affirmative measures might
produce the declarant, the obligation of good faith may
demand their effectuation.

Roberts, 448 U.S. at 74 (emphasis in original).

The Supreme Court also emphasized that the 
lengths to
 
11

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
which the prosecution must go to produce a witness . . . is a 
question of reasonableness.  Id. (quoting California v. Green, 
399 U.S. 149, 189 n.22 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)). To satisfy the unavailability requirement of the United States Constitution, the prosecution must show that the witness is unavailable despite good-faith efforts undertaken prior to trial to locate and present that witness.  Id. at 74-75. 
This court has also explained that a good faith effort 
requires that the prosecution has made vigorous and appropriate steps to procure the complaining witness  presence at trial . . . 
.  State v. Lee , 83 Hawai» i 267, 277, 925 P.2d 1091, 1101 (1996) 
(emphasis and block format omitted) (quoting State v. Ortiz, 74 
Haw. 343, 363, 845 P.2d 547, 556-57 (1993)). In Lee, this court 
expressly adopted the unavailability standard announced in United 
States v. Lynch: establishment of the prosecution s reasonable efforts to secure the presence of the declarant require[s] a search equally as vigorous as that which the government would undertake to find a critical witness if it has no prior testimony to rely upon in the event of unavailability[.]    Id. at 278, 
925 P.2d at 1102 (relying on United States v. Lynch, 499 F.2d 
1011, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 1974)). As discussed below, the 
prosecution satisfied the tests announced in Roberts  and Lee by 
moving to sever the trial when it became apparent Daughter 1 may 
12

*** NOT  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
13not appear, having an investigator attempt to locate Daughter 1,
subpoenaing Huerta to locate Daughter 1, and through Huerta s
attempts to locate Daughter 1.
1.The prosecution s efforts to locate Daughter 1  
satisfied the Sixth Amendment s unavailability  
requirement.
The admission of Daughter 1 s preliminary hearing
testimony into evidence did not violate the Sixth Amendment of
the United States Constitution.  In Roberts, the prosecution
sought to introduce prior testimony of a witness, Anita Isaacs,
and submitted evidence to establish her unavailability.  Roberts,
448 U.S. at 59.  The prosecutor spoke with Anita s mother four
months before trial.  Id.  at 75.  Anita s mother told the
prosecutor that she did not know Anita s location, had last heard
from Anita during the preceding summer, and had no way of
contacting Anita in an emergency.  Id.  The prosecution issued
five subpoenas to Anita s mother in the several months before
trial.  Id.   Additionally, at the hearing to determine the
admissibility of the preliminary hearing testimony, the
prosecutor stated to the court that the defendant  witnessed that
I have attempted to locate, I have subpoenaed, there has been a
voir dire  of the witness  parents, and they have not been able to
locate her for over a year.   Id.  Upon review, the Supreme Court
held that given  these facts, the prosecution did not breach its*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
duty of good-faith effort.  Id. The Supreme Court held that a

conversation with Anita s mother -- where the mother told the

prosecutor that she did not know Anita s location -- along with

five subpoenas served on Anita s mother at her residence,

satisfied the prosecution s burden to show Anita s

unavailability.
8 The Court emphasized that

the service and ineffectiveness of the five subpoenas and
the conversation with Anita s mother were far more than mere

reluctance to face the possibility of a refusal. It was

investigation at the last-known real address, and it was
conversation with a parent who was concerned about her
daughter s whereabouts.

Id. at 76.

8 The dissent asserts that serving five subpoenas over a span of
several months is evidence that the prosecution remained in contact with
Anita s parents and made periodic checks with them to determine if they had
any new information on Anita s whereabouts.  Dissent at 29 (footnotes
omitted). Although the Supreme Court noted that the prosecutor was in touch

with [Anita s mother] and discussed with her Anita s whereabouts[,]  the
Supreme Court did not establish that the prosecutor made periodic checks 
with Anita s parents outside of sending subpoenas to their residence. See

Roberts, 448 U.S. at 75, 76 ( the service and ineffectiveness of the five
subpoenas and the conversation with Anita s mother were far more than mere
reluctance to face the possibility of a refusal. ). For instance, Justice
Brennan s dissenting opinion states that from 
 all that appears in the record
- and there has been no suggestion that the record is incomplete in this
respect - the State s total effort to secure Anita s attendance at

respondent s trial consisted of the delivery of five subpoenas in her name to
her parents  residence, and three of those were issued after the authorities
had learned that she was no longer living there.  Id. at 79 (Brennan, J.,
dissenting) (footnote omitted).
Additionally, although the dissent notes that the prosecution conducted
a voir dire  of Anita s mother in Roberts, Dissent at 28, the voir dire hearing
occurred at trial after the prosecutor sought to introduce Anita s preliminary
hearing testimony. Roberts, 448 U.S. at 59. The hearing was conducted at
defendant s request to establish Anita s unavailability. Id. at 59, 75.
Anita s mother was the sole witness at voir dire  and testified that she
 knew of no way to reach Anita in case of an emergency.  Id. at 59-60. The

voir dire of Anita s mother is analogous to calling Huerta at trial to testify
about Daughter 1 s unavailability, and is not an additional effort made by the
prosecution in Roberts  to establish Anita s unavailability.

14

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Applying the Supreme Court s analysis in Roberts, the

prosecution in the present matter satisfied its obligation to

make a good faith effort. Like the prosecutor in Roberts , the

prosecution served a person, Huerta, who was concerned about

Daughter 1 s whereabouts. For instance, Huerta testified that,
 
prior to being served, she was unable to locate Daughter 1 after

she ran away from her placement at the Hale Opio Girls Home Group

Program on January 16, 2007. Thus, like Anita s mother, Huerta
 
was concerned about Daughter 1 s whereabouts and could not locate

Daughter 1.

Additionally, the service of the subpoena on Huerta

prompted Huerta to take additional efforts to locate Daughter 1. 
 For instance, Huerta testified that she was served with a

subpoena to bring [Daughter 1] to court for this trial[.]
 
 
(Emphasis added.) The subpoena also indicates that Daughter 1
 
was served care of  Huerta. In complying with this subpoena,

Huerta testified she had been unable to locate Daughter 1 despite

contacting the juvenile delinquent program, placing an ad in the

newspaper, visiting Daughter 1 s mother s home where Daughter 1

had resided on numerous occasions, talking to many people in the
 
community[,]  and contacting police officers and calling them to
 see if they ve seen or heard of her recently . . . .  Huerta s

efforts met the good faith standard announced in Roberts . We

15

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
respectfully disagree with the dissent s suggestion that her

efforts could not establish a good faith effort to locate

Daughter 1 because she was not a prosecutorial authority.  
 
Dissent at 13 (citing Barber , 390 U.S. at 724-25). The efforts

of a social worker to locate an unavailable witness can establish

that a good faith effort was made to bring the witness to trial. 
 See infra at 21-23.

Finally, unlike Roberts , the prosecution assigned an

investigator to locate Daughter 1
9 and moved to sever the trial

9 Although the dissent asserts that the bare statement that the

prosecution had its investigator go out and try to find her himself  is
manifestly insufficient  to establish that the prosecution made a good faith
effort to locate Daughter 1, Dissent at 20, even without this statement, the
prosecution established a good faith effort by serving the subpoena on Huerta,
having Huerta make numerous efforts to locate Daughter 1, and moving to sever
the trial. Additionally, this court can rely upon an undisputed
representation by the prosecutor at a hearing to bolster its conclusion that
the prosecution made good faith efforts to locate Daughter 1. See Hiler v.

State, 796 P.2d 346, 349 (Okla. Crim. App. 1990) (holding that the
prosecution s uncontroverted assertion was sufficient to show that [the
witness] was unavailable to testify ) (citing Munson v. State , 758 P.2d 324,
333 (Okla. Crim. App. 1988)); Munson , 758 P.2d at 333 (holding that the
prosecution established a witness  unavailability partly based on a
prosecutor s representation of a conversation with a prosecutor from another
state), cert. denied 488 U.S. 1019 (1989).
The dissent distinguishes Hiler by asserting that Hiler waived his
confrontation argument by introducing the preliminary hearing testimony in his
case in chief. Dissent at 22. Respectfully, this argument is unpersuasive
because the court held that 
[n]otwithstanding appellant s waiver of these
issues, we hold that appellant s right to confrontation was not abridged
through the use of [the witness]  preliminary hearing testimony and that the
prosecution s uncontroverted assertion was sufficient to show that [the
witness] was unavailable to testify.  Hiler, 796 P.2d at 349 (emphasis
added). Thus, this court can rely on the uncontroverted representation of the
prosecutor to establish that it made a good faith effort.
Moreover, although the dissent notes, and we agree, that Munson  is

factually distinct because the court did not rely solely on the
representations of the prosecutor, Dissent at 22-23, the Hiler court

interpreted Munson as supporting the proposition that the prosecution s
uncontroverted assertion was sufficient to show that [the witness] was
unavailable to testify.  Hiler, 796 P.2d at 349 (citing Munson, 758 P.2d at

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
when it became apparent that the prosecution would have

difficulty locating Daughter 1 for trial. The prosecution s
 
efforts before trial exceeded the efforts the prosecutors took in

Roberts.10 Thus, under Roberts, the prosecution established

9(...continued)
333). Thus, although the dissent correctly observes that Munson  is distinct,
the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals interpreted Munson as supporting the
proposition we use it for. 
See id.

10 As the dissent points out, there are factual differences between
Roberts  and this case. See Dissent at 27-33. For instance, in Roberts, the
prosecution served five subpoenas over the course of several months. However,
the prosecution served three of these subpoenas after it knew Anita did not
reside at her mother s residence. See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 79-80 & n.3
(Brennan, J., dissenting). Returns for the remaining two subpoenas were made
on November 3 and November 4, 1975. Id. Thus, although the number of
subpoenas issued in Roberts  appears to suggest that the prosecutor s efforts
in that case outweigh the prosecution s efforts in this case, the prosecution
only issued two subpoenas -- one day apart -- at Anita s mother s house before
they knew that Anita did not reside with her mother.
Additionally, as the dissent discusses, the subpoena in this case
was served after the prosecution had moved to sever the trial based on
Daughter 1 s unavailability. This does not demonstrate the prosecution s bad

faith  in serving the subpoena, but instead demonstrates that the prosecution
served Huerta to prompt her to take additional efforts to locate Daughter 1.
This is evidenced by Huerta s testimony that she was served with a subpoena
to bring [Daughter 1] to court for this trial[.]  Furthermore, the
prosecution s adherence to a necessary legal process does not indicate that
its service of the subpoena was truly a meaningless exercise, bereft of any
good faith basis.  Dissent at 17 (footnote omitted). The prosecution had acontinuing legal obligation to produce Daughter 1 for trial, and serving asubpoena on Huerta was part of that obligation. See State v. Ortiz, 74 Haw.
343, 363, 845 P.2d 547, 557 (1993), overruled on other grounds, State v. 
Moore, 82 Hawai
»i 202, 221, 921 P.2d 122, 141 (1996). Fulfilling this
obligation by subpoenaing Huerta, even though Daughter 1 had run away, doesnot suggest that the prosecution s effort was bereft of any good faith
basis.  
The dissent also notes that the subpoena was served eleven days
before trial. Dissent at 28, 30. However, courts have held that the
prosecution s efforts were reasonable when attempting to serve the witness at
a similar time before trial. Pillette v. Berghuis , 630 F. Supp.2d 791, 804
(E.D. Mich. 2009) (holding that the prosecution s efforts to locate an
unavailable witness were reasonable when the prosecution, among other efforts,
attempted serve the witness approximately two weeks  before trial); State v.

Black, 621 N.E.2d 484, 487 (Ohio App. 1993) (rejecting defendant s argument
that the state should have attempted to locate the witness more than a week in
advance of trial and declin[ing] to adopt a bright-line rule establishing a
time limit for efforts to be made to produce a witness. ).

10(...continued)
Finally, the prosecution also took efforts to locate Daughter 1
that the prosecution did not take in Roberts  by assigning an investigator to
locate Daughter 1 and moving to sever the trial when it became apparent that
it would be difficult to locate Daughter 1.  When compared to Roberts , the
prosecution s efforts in this case were reasonable, and Vinhaca s rights under
the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution were therefore not
violated. 
18Daughter 1 s unavailability.
2.The prosecution has satisfied the unavailability test  
adopted in State v. Lee.
In State v. Lee , this court adopted the following
standard for the prosecution to prove unavailability:  
establishment of the prosecution s reasonable efforts to
secure the presence of the declarant  require[s] a search
equally as vigorous as that which the government would
undertake to find a critical witness if it has no prior
testimony to rely upon in the event of  unavailability,   .
. . .
Lee, 83 Hawai i at 278, 925 P.2d at 1102 (relying on Lynch, 499
F.2d at 1023).»
This court has also stated that the mere  service of a
subpoena on the complaining witness did not establish her
unavailability . . . .   State v. Beyer , 72 Haw. 469, 473, 822
P.2d 519, 521 (1991), overruled on other grounds, Moore, 82
Hawai i at 220, 921 P.2d at 140; Lee, 83 Hawai i at 277 n.11, 925
P.2d at 1101 n.11 (quoting Beyer , 72 Haw. at 473, 822 P.2d at
521).» »
The prosecution satisfied the standard adopted in Lee
for three reasons.  First, nothing suggests the prosecution
intended to rely on the preliminary hearing testimony or that it *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
would have taken additional measures if it did not have Daughter

1 s preliminary hearing testimony. As discussed above, the
 
prosecution assigned an investigator to locate Daughter 1. Thus,
 
a person within the prosecutor s office attempted to locate

Daughter 1.

Additionally, when the prosecution discovered Daughter 
1 would not likely appear at trial, it moved to sever the trial 
to avoid relying on Daughter 1 s preliminary hearing testimony. This court has implied that moving for a continuance evidences 
the prosecution s good faith effort to locate a witness. See 
Moore, 82 Hawai» i at 224, 921 P.2d at 144 (noting that the 
prosecution s motion for a continuance, which was opposed by the defendant, was denied); see also United States v. Lynch, 499 F.2d 
1011, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 1974) ( It is difficult to believe that if the preliminary hearing testimony of this critical witness were 
not available, the prosecution would have abandoned its efforts at this point to locate Miss Brown and concluded its case. We 
believe the prosecution would have asked the court for additional time within which to find her. ) (emphasis added).
11 The 
11

The dissent correctly notes that the prosecution did not seek a
continuance of the entire trial, but did not object to one. See Dissent at

40-44. Although the prosecution did not request to continue the entire trial,
it moved to sever the trial because it was prepared to proceed on those counts
relating to Daughter 2. The prosecution requested to sever the trial because
it would be severely prejudiced  by having to proceed on charges relating to
Daughter 1 when she was unavailable for trial. It is apparent from the record
that both the prosecution and the defense understood that if the motion to
(continued...)

19

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prosecution in this case notified the circuit court that it would

have trouble locating Daughter 1, and that it would prefer moving

forward with the charges related to Daughter 2. Vinhaca opposed
 
the prosecution s motion to sever and the circuit court denied

the motion. The prosecution s motion to sever illustrates that

its effort to locate Daughter 1 was in good faith because it

requested additional time to locate Daughter 1.

Furthermore, the prosecution subpoenaed Huerta and

Huerta attempted to locate Daughter 1. Thus, the prosecution
 
made good faith efforts to locate Daughter 1 and nothing suggests

that the prosecution would have taken additional efforts to

locate Daughter 1 if it did not have her preliminary hearing

testimony.

11(...continued)
sever was granted, the trial with regard to Daughter 1 would not proceed as
scheduled. Thus, the motion to sever was the functional equivalent of a
motion to continue the trial relating to Daughter 1 because it requested
additional time to search for Daughter 1.
In response to the prosecution s motion to sever, Vinhaca asserted that
the 
State should seek a continuance of the entire trial and all of the
 
pending charges or should dismiss the charges that the State is not able to
prosecute and proceed with the charges that the State is able to.  In reply,
the prosecution asserted that [j]ustice would be best served by allowing the
State to proceed on [] (and have Defendant face in a timely manner) Counts 1
through 8.  The dissent asserts that the record reflects that Respondent
could have asked for a continuance on its own, but did not.  Dissent at 42. 
 
Respectfully, the prosecution s neutrality with regard to continuing the
entire trial does not undercut the inference of good faith that its request to
sever, and thus continue with regard to Daughter 1, raised.
Furthermore, contrary to the dissent s suggestion, the discussion above
illustrates that the prosecution did not obviously intend[] to rely on the
preliminary hearing transcript of Daughter 1, despite its motion to sever. 
Dissent at 40. The prosecution s motion to sever demonstrates that it
attempted to avoid using Daughter 1 s preliminary hearing testimony by
severing the trial and proceeding on those charges related to Daughter 2.

20

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Second, the prosecution s subpoena to Huerta prompted

Huerta to take additional efforts to locate Daughter 1. Other

courts have included the efforts of social services workers in

determining whether the prosecution made a good faith effort to

locate a witness. For instance, in State v. Black , 621 N.E.2d

484, 487-88 (Ohio App. 1993), the court held that the prosecution

made a good faith effort to locate a run-away thirteen year old

witness ( Brock ) by contacting the DHS and having members of DHS

look for the witness. The prosecution presented four witnesses
 
to testify with respect to their efforts to locate Brock.  Id.

at 487. The four witnesses were a supervisor in the Children s

Division of the Hamilton County Department of Human Services, a

supervisor in the special-placement unit of the Montgomery County

Children s Services, a case worker at Montgomery County

Children s Services, and Brock s mother.  Id. The court stated

that the testimony of these witnesses established:

[T]hat Brock had been discharged from the United Methodist
Children s Home in 1990 and had been returned to the custody
of the Montgomery County Children s Board. The Montgomery
County Children s Board returned custody of Brock to her
mother in January 1992, after she had been missing for a
period of six months. Brock s mother testified that she had

not seen her daughter since 1991 and that she had no idea
where Brock was currently staying. Brock s dental records
had been given to the police and a warrant had been issued
for her arrest, but the police had been unable to locate
her.

Id. at 776, 621 N.E.2d at 487 (emphasis added).

The court concluded that the testimony of the four

21

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
witnesses, none of whom were members of the prosecution, 
established the unavailability of the run-away child. The court 
held that Brock was unavailable because the record reveals that 
Brock had a history of running away from her mother s home and from juvenile facilities; and that Brock had not been seen by her mother or juvenile authorities for a period of several months.  Id. at 487-88. Thus, even though the prosecution  must make 
efforts to locate the witnesses, the efforts of DHS to look for a 
run-away teenage witness are not considered separately from the
 prosecution s efforts. 

Similarly, in State v. Sanchez , 592 A.2d 413, 415

(Conn. App. 1991), a thirteen year old witness, E,  was turned

over to the juvenile authorities  for possessing cocaine and

heroin and left for Puerto Rico two days later. In the

subsequent trial of Sanchez, the state sought to introduce E s

deposition testimony. The state could not locate E before trial. 
 Id. The court held that the state established E s unavailability

because the state contacted an investigator for the juvenile

court from the public defender s office and also a juvenile

division probation officer in an attempt to locate E.  Id. The

investigator was unsuccessful in locating E, and the probation

office had no information about E s whereabouts. Id. at 415-16. 
 
Also, the investigation stemming from information presented by
 
22

 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the defendant to the state as to E s whereabouts proved 
fruitless.  Id. at 416. Furthermore, the state deposed E before 
she was released because of her probable unavailability and the defendant did not object to that procedure. Id. In Sanchez, the 
efforts of two witnesses, in offices distinct from the prosecutor s office, sufficed to establish E s unavailability. See also United States v. Thornton, 16 M.J. 1011, 1013 (A.C.M.R. 
1983) (holding that the prosecution made a good faith effort to produce a German citizen where the prosecution tried to produce 
the witness  presence by subpoena, and also sought assistance 
from her mother, her friends, and the German police. ); United 
States v. Rundle, 298 F. Supp. 392, 395 (E.D. Pa. 1969) (holding 
that prosecution established good faith effort where in addition 
to the efforts of an investigator from the District Attorney s office, an Administrative Assistant from the Fort Mifflin Youth 
Development Center and the witness  mother testified that they were unable to locate the witness). Thus, because Huerta took extensive efforts to locate Daughter 1, the prosecution satisfied its obligation to show Daughter 1 was unavailable. 
Third, although the prosecution could have taken 
additional efforts to locate Daughter 1, like driver s license or motor vehicle registration searches[,]  see Lee, 83 Hawai» i at 
279, 925 P.2d at 1103, these efforts would have been futile given 
23

*** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Daughter 1 was a minor, her history as a run-away, and the 
efforts already taken by the prosecution to locate her. Courts 
have recognized the increased difficulty of locating run-away 
minors, and have weighed this in determining whether the prosecution s efforts to locate a witness were reasonable. See 
Black, 621 N.E.2d at 488 (noting that the witness had a history of running away and stating that in light of [the witness ]

history and the efforts made by the prosecution to find her, we

hold that the trial judge had sufficient evidence to find that

[the witness] was unavailable ) (emphasis added); Commonwealth v.

Jackson, 344 A.2d 842, 844 (Pa. 1975) (holding that the state

satisfied the good faith requirement because it presented
 
evidence that the child [witness] mysteriously disappeared

shortly before trial and that he had previously run away many
 
times.  ). For instance, in Roberts , the Court held that the

prosecution was not required to take additional efforts to locate

Anita because the great improbability that such efforts would

have resulted in locating the witness, and would have led to her

production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept of

reasonableness required their execution.  Roberts, 448 U.S. at

75-76. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that additional efforts

would have proved fruitful given that Daughter 1 had run away

many times since October 31, 2006, and the prosecution subpoenaed

24

*** NOT  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
25Huerta and assigned an investigator to locate Daughter 1 and
neither person could find Daughter 1.  The Confrontation Clause
does not require the prosecution to take all possible efforts to
locate a witness, but only requires the prosecution to take
reasonable good faith efforts  to locate a witness.  Reed v.
Hathaway, 596 F. Supp.2d 1200, 1206 (C.D. Ill. 2009) ( The rule
is not that the government must do everything it can to get a
witness to testify, rather only that it make a reasonable, good
faith effort to get the witness into court. ) (citing United
States v. Reed , 227 F.3d 763, 767 (7th Cir. 2000)).  The
prosecution fulfilled its obligation to make a good faith effort
to locate Daughter 1, and additional efforts would have proved
futile.
