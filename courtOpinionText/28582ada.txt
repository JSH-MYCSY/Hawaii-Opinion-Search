In the Interest of RGB, A Minor
 
NO. 28582
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
(FC-S NO. 01-0063)
 
APRIL 1, 2010
 
MOON, C.J., NAKAYAMA, AND RECKTENWALD, JJ.;
AND ACOBA, J., DISSENTING, WITH WHOM DUFFY, J., JOINS
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, J.
 
In this appeal, we consider whether the family court

 
abused its discretion in denying Mother’s motion for relief from
 
an order terminating Mother’s parental rights. The motion
 alleged that Mother received ineffective assistance of counsel in
 the proceeding that resulted in the termination order, as well as
 in her direct appeal from that order.
 
Mother’s child, RGB, was born in July of 1999. RGB was
 
taken into protective custody on March 30, 2001, after she was
 found dirty and without a diaper or underclothing in the custody
 of Mother’s ex-boyfriend, who had a history of substance abuse
 and had been diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. RGB
 was later returned to Mother, but was placed in foster custody in
 April, 2002, and has remained with the same foster family since
 then. Mother and RGB were subsequently involved in a series of
 interactions with the Department of Human Services (DHS) and
 proceedings before the Family Court for the Third Circuit (family
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court). Mother was allowed to visit with RGB, but these visits
 
had increasingly negative effects on RGB and were discontinued by
 the family court in 2004 after it concluded that “the visits were
 causing injury to [RGB’s] psychological capacity as evidenced by
 a substantial impairment in [RGB’s] ability to function.” 
After conducting a six-day permanency hearing, the
 
family court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 Order terminating Mother’s parental rights (Termination Order) on
 March 11, 2005.
1 On February 6, 2007, Mother filed a motion for
 
“1) New Trial, and/or 2) To Reconsider and/or Amend Judgment
 and/or All Previous Orders, and/or 3) For Release of All Evidence
 or Files in Case, and/or 4) For Dismissal,” alleging that her
 prior counsel was ineffective. The family court denied Mother’s
 motion on May 8, 2007. 
Mother seeks review of the May 21, 2009 judgment of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), entered pursuant to its
 April 9, 2009 Summary Disposition Order (SDO), affirming the
 family court’s order denying Mother’s motion. In her application
 for a writ of certiorari (application), Mother raises the
 following questions:
 
A. Whether The Intermediate Court Of Appeals (“ICA”)
“Borrowing” Of Criminal Matters Analogy To Apply To
Family Court Claims Of Ineffective Counsel Is
Authorized By Law And Meets Constitutional Standards?
 
B. Whether The ICA Upholding Of The Trial Court’s
Refusal To Release “Confidential” Records That
 
Appellate’s [sic] Counsel Could Not Examine But At The
 
1
 The Honorable Ben H. Gaddis presided.
 
-2­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Same Time Requiring Counsel To “Identify Any Prejudice
Stemming From This Limitation” Meets Fair Disclosure
Standards?
 
We resolve Mother’s appeal as follows. First, we 
consider the basis of Mother’s ineffective assistance of counsel 
claim. Since we conclude that the family court properly determined that Mother had a right to counsel under the United States Constitution in the circumstances of this case, we do not reach the question of whether the Hawai
'i Constitution provides 
indigent parents a right to counsel in all termination proceedings. Second, we conclude that a Hawai
'i Family Court 
Rules (HFCR) Rule 60(b)(6) motion was an appropriate method for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the circumstances of this case. 
Third, we hold that the family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in denying Mother’s motion, particularly in view of
 the negative impacts on RGB of the delay in resolving her
 custodial status. Thus, we respectfully disagree with the
 dissenting opinion’s view that such impacts should not be
 considered in assessing that motion. Dissenting Opinion at 81­82. The motion was filed nearly two years after the family
 
court’s March 11, 2005 order terminating Mother’s parental
 rights, and contained no allegations whatsoever about what errors
 had occurred in the family court proceedings leading up to the
 entry of the Termination Order. By the time the motion was
 filed, RGB had been living with the same foster family for nearly
 
-3­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
five years, and wanted to be adopted by that family. However,
 
the adoption had been delayed pending the resolution of these
 proceedings. As set forth in a January 2006 report by DHS to the
 family court:
 
[RGB’s foster parents] want to adopt [RGB] and have
been ready to proceed with the adoption process ever
since biological mother’s parental rights were
terminated in March 2005. However, biological
Mother’s pending appeal to the court . . . has
prevented the DHS and [RGB’s foster parents] from
proceeding with the adoption. Hence, [foster parents]
and [RGB] and the entire family are disappointed. Per
 [foster mother], [RGB] continually wonders and asks
“when will she be adopted”.
 
Given those circumstances, and given Mother’s failure
 
in the Rule 60(b)(6) motion to identify any potentially
 
meritorious issues that would have been raised but for the
 ineffectiveness of her counsel, the family court did not abuse
 its discretion when it denied the motion.
 
Finally, we hold that the family court did not abuse
 
its discretion in precluding Mother from having access to those
 records in this case that were generated after September 28,
 2006, i.e., more than a year after her parental rights were
 terminated, while allowing her to have access to records created
 prior to that date for purposes of appeal.
 
Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the ICA.
 
I. Background
 
A. Termination of Parental Rights
 
DHS first became involved with Mother and RGB on
 
March 30, 2001, when RGB was taken into protective custody. On
 
-4­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
April 6, 2001, the family court awarded DHS temporary foster
 
custody of RGB. On June 15, 2001, RGB was returned to Mother’s
 care under family supervision. On April 4, 2002, the family
 court awarded foster custody to DHS. Mother was allowed
 supervised visitation. On April 1, 2004, the family court
 suspended visitation between Mother and RGB indefinitely. 
A permanent plan hearing was held on August 23,
 
August 30, September 3, September 20, September 27 and
 December 13, 2004.
2 On March 11, 2005, the family court issued
 
its Termination Order, which included the following relevant
 Findings of Fact (FsOF):
3
 
3. Mother grew up on the mainland in difficult
circumstances. She was hospitalized on at least four
different occasions for psychiatric conditions.
Mother abused drugs and substances. She was in a
 series of unstable, sometimes violent relationships

 
with men.
4. Mother had another child who was removed
 
from her care by the State of California. Over her
 objection, the parental rights of Mother to her older
daughter were terminated, and the child was
permanently placed with Mother’s sister.
 
. . .
 
6. While living in the bay area of California,
Mother again became pregnant. Fearful that California
 
2 No transcripts of this or any other proceeding in this case were
included in the record on appeal.
 
3 Mother did not dispute the family court’s FsOF in her February 6,
2007 motion, in her appeal to the ICA, or in her application to this court,and we therefore rely on the family court’s FsOF for the purposes this appeal.Cf. Robert’s Haw. Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai' i 224,
239, 982 P.2d 853, 868 (1999) (holding that “[f]indings of fact that areunchallenged on appeal are the operative facts of a case”), superseded bystatute on other grounds as recognized in Haw. Med. Ass’n v. Haw. Med. Serv.Ass’n, 113 Hawai' i 77, 107, 148 P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006).
Moreover, we note that the dissent relies in part on the family
court’s FsOF regarding Mother’s mental health condition to dispute the
propriety of the family court’s decision to discharge Mother’s counsel,
Dissenting Opinion at 78, and also relies on DHS’s Answering Brief to the ICA,
which draws significantly from the FsOF, for its own recitation of the facts,
Dissenting Opinion at 4-7. 
-5­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
authorities would remove her second child, she moved
to Hawai' i when eight months pregnant with [RGB]. 
. . .
 
8. Mother encountered many difficulties living
in Hawai' i after the birth of [RGB]. She did not 
apply for public assistance because she was fearfulthat State authorities might remove [RGB]. She had very little money. At times she and [RGB] werehomeless. 
9. On March 30, 2001, [RGB] was taken into
police protective custody after she was found in the
care of [Mother’s ex-boyfriend]. At the time that she
 was placed in police custody, she was dirty and did
not have on a diaper or underclothing.
10. [Mother’s ex-boyfriend] and Mother had been
in a relationship for many years. [Mother’s ex-
boyfriend] had a history of substance abuse and a
mental health diagnosis of chronic paranoid
schizophrenia with acute exacerbation. He had been
 acquitted of two sexual assault offenses due to

incapacity.
11. A temporary foster custody hearing was
conducted. Mother applied for and received the
services of court-appointed attorney, Cynthia Linet.
12. On April 6, 2001, the Family Court awarded
the Department of Human Services (“DHS”), temporary
foster custody of [RGB] on the basis that she was
subject to imminent harm due to Mother’s past history
of mental health problems and her current relationship
with [Mother’s ex-boyfriend].
 
. . . 
14. On June 15, 2001, . . . the Court returned
[RGB] to [Mother’s] care under family supervision.
15. On November 29, 2001, DHS again petitioned
the Court for foster custody of [RGB]. Mother and
 [RGB] had been evicted from the homeless shelter and
had moved to the Rossmond Hotel. Mother was having
difficulty controlling [RGB] and following through
with skills taught by the parenting program that she
attended.
 
16. The Court . . . continued family
supervision of Mother and [RGB].
17. Mother’s attorney, Ms. Linet, moved to
withdraw as counsel. Mother asked to be allowed to
 represent herself. The Court allowed Ms. Linet to
 withdraw as Mother’s counsel and allowed Mother to
 
appear pro se.
 
18. On April 4, 2002, DHS again petitioned for
foster custody of [RGB]. Mother and [RGB] had moved
back to the homeless shelter because the Rossmond
 Hotel was closed for renovation. . . . Based on
 representations made, the Court awarded foster custody
of [RGB] to DHS and scheduled a contested disposition
hearing to determine whether [RGB] should remain in

 
foster care.
19. The Court appointed Alexander W. Thoene,
 
-6­25. On September 19, 2002, a . . . visit did
not go well. Mother seemed easily frustrated. When
 
[RGB] wanted to call her foster mother or preschool
teacher on a play phone, Mother stopped participating
in the play. Mother became emotional and made
 inappropriate statements to [RGB] such as, “I’m your
mommy, they want to take you away and make you think
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Jr.[ 4]
 to serve as counsel for Mother.  The
 
disposition hearing was conducted on April 12, 15, and
May 14, 2002. Mother failed to appear for the fourth
day of the disposition hearing on June 17, 2002.
20. The Court defaulted Mother for purposes of
the disposition hearing and found that she suffered
from a mental condition which distorted her perception
of the people that she had been in contact with to the
point that she considered all of them to be conspiring
against her to deprive her of [RGB]. The Court
 concluded that this perception of Mother and her
inability to control her emotions led her to have
conflicts with people who had been trying to assist
her. The Court found that Mother was a person of
above-average intelligence and was able to pass parent
education classes. Not withstanding her cognitive
abilities, the Court found that Mother’s mental
disorder prevented her from applying the lessons
learned to adequately parent [RGB], and that
consequently, [RGB] was often deprived of clean and
appropriate clothing, did not bathe on a regular
basis, and did not have adequate supervision. The
 Court determined that this was not a simple matter of
Mother having a different lifestyle, but more a matter
of Mother being incapable of adapting to situations
which were incompatible with her lifestyle and
beliefs, and that this inability to adapt, was a by-
product of her mental disorder, and endangered [RGB]
and rendered Mother incapable of providing a safe home
for [RGB]. The Court concluded that continuation of
 [RGB] in Mother’s care would result in serious injury
to [RGB], delaying physical, emotional, social, and or
psychological development with long term negative
consequences for [RGB].
 
. . .
 
22. On July 8, 2002, Mother filed a motion to
terminate Alexander W. Thoene, Jr. as her counsel. 
She indicated that she would proceed pro se. On
 
August 8, 2002, the Court granted Mother’s request to
proceed pro se, but required Mr. Thoene to serve as
stand-by counsel for Mother to assist her in the
presentation of her case.
 
. . .
 24. At first, visits . . . between Mother and
[RGB] went well. [RGB] appeared more loving towards
Mother and did not seem to be resistant to visits. 
Mother interacted with [RGB] very appropriately, . . .
4
 Thoene is referred to variously in the record as “Alexander” and
“Alika.” For the purposes of this opinion, we adopt the phrasing reflected in
the family court’s FsOF and appointment of counsel, and utilize the name
“Alexander.” 
-7­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
someone else is your mommy, but I am your mommy.”
[RGB] had to go to the bathroom five times in the last
hour of the visit.
 
. . . 
27. In the summer and fall of 2002, [RGB] began
to make statements about a “man in a brown car.” 
[RGB] made statements that suggested that the man had
been violent towards Mother. [RGB] also said that the
man in the brown car put a thing in her mouth and she
threw up. Service providers became concerned that
[RGB] may have been sexually abused by a male before
she was placed into foster care.
28. Mother’s response to the concern about the
possible sex abuse of [RGB] was to vehemently reject
any possibility that the child had been sexually
abused while in her care. Much later in the case,
Mother disclosed that she had owned a brown car during
the time that she and [RGB] were homeless. . . . 
. . .
 33. During the early part of 2003, Mother’s
visits with [RGB] continued. While most visits went
 well, more difficulties arose in February. Mother
 began to make inappropriate comments to [RGB] during
supervised visits. Comments by Mother included
statements such as, “They are brain washing you” and
“Mommy is looking for a house and soon you can come
home.” . . .
 
34. The foster mother reported that [RGB]
returned from visits with Mother very upset with
concerns about where she was going to live and whether
she would be moved. . . . 
. . .
 
35. Between January and March 2003, [RGB] had
displayed numerous anxious behaviors both in the home
of the foster parents and in therapy. After visits
 with Mother were suspended, [RGB’s] anxious behaviors
abated.
 
. . .
 37. On May 1, 2003, at Mother’s request, stand­
by counsel, Alexander W. Thoene, Jr. withdrew and G.
Kay Iopa was appointed as replacement stand-by counsel
for Mother.
 
38. Throughout this proceeding, Mother has had
difficulties with her attorneys. At times, she has
 
insisted on proceeding pro se. At other times, she
has requested new counsel or postponements until she
could gather enough funds to hire counsel of her
choice. Mother has proven herself unable to organize
and effectively present her own case. At the same
 time, she has often refused to allow her court-
appointed counsel to proceed on her behalf. For this
 reason, the Court appointed Mother stand-by counsel.
Mother was allowed to present her own case and
question witnesses to the extent that she was able to
do so, but she was also allowed to rely on stand-by
counsel to present her case when she was not able to
proceed. Stand-by counsel was also available to
assist Mother in the preparation of appropriate
motions and pleadings.
 
. . .
 
-8­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
42. On August 8, 2003, [RGB] had a visit with
Mother at Parent’s Inc. This visit seemed to go well,
but the foster mother reported that on the drive home
from the visit, [RGB] asked about what happens to
mommies that hurt their babies. The foster mother
 asked how the mommy hurt the baby and [RGB] responded
that the mother took the baby to the man in the brown
car and held her down and the man “hurt me.” [RGB]
told the foster mother that the man said that he was
 going to cut her with a knife and was going to put it
in her “tuni” and cut her up. “Tuni” is a word that
 [RGB] uses for vagina. [RGB] related that she kicked
the man in his leg and he got really mad and slapped
her and she screamed loud. [RGB] also said that . . .
Mother[] let the man put medicine in her mouth and
that she threw up all over Mother’s bed. Concerns
 about the statements of the child caused DHS again to
suspend[] visits with Mother.
43. On August 28, 2003, visits between [RGB]
and Mother again resumed . . . .
44. During this period, there were numerous
conflicts between Mother and the supervising agency 
. . . .
 
. . .
 
54. At a review hearing on January 29, 2004,
the DHS worker reported that Mother continued to make
inappropriate statements to [RGB] about how she was
going to return to Mother. The social worker
 indicated that [RGB’s] old fears had returned. . . .
55. [RGB] and Mother continued to visit twice a
week for one and a half hours per visit under the
supervision of a DHS aide. While the visits seemed to
 go well, [RGB] showed troubling signs of distress in
her play sessions with her therapist. Prior to visits
 with Mother, [RGB] would cry frantically and vomited
on one occasion.
 
56. In February 2004, in the evenings, [RGB]
began complaining of a fast heart beat and gasping for
breath. Her pediatrician . . . diagnosed her with
adjustment disorder noting that the stress reaction
was likely caused by the visits that [RGB] had with
Mother.
 
. . .
 
59. On March 12, 2004, [RGB] asked to leave a
supervised visit early. Mother became very upset and
began to accuse the supervisor of training [RGB] to
make such statements. The visitation supervisor
attempted to terminate the visit, but Mother continued
to escalate emotionally, threatening to sue the social
worker and saying that she would talk to the Governor.
[RGB] reacted by trying to reassure and placate both
Mother and the visitation supervisor. [RGB] cried as
the supervisor carried her back to the State Building
where [RGB] was placed in an office. Mother followed
 [RGB] and supervisor back to the office where she
created a scene, shouting and demanding to see [RGB].
After Mother finally left, [RGB] asked the visitation
supervisor whether it was safe to leave.
 
. . .
 
-9­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
57.[ 5]
  On March 18, 2004, the Court again
suspended visits between Mother and [RGB] pending
another court hearing.
 
. . . 
 
59. On April 1, 2004, after a hearing, the
Court concluded that further visits with Mother would
 be psychologically injurious to [RGB]. Visitations
 between [RGB] and Mother were suspended indefinitely.
60. Shortly after the visits with Mother were
suspended, [RGB’s] symptoms of distress and anxiety
disappeared.
61. Mother has had no contact with [RGB] since
March 12, 2004.
62. Over the years, Mother has substantially
improved her circumstances. She has stopped abusing
drugs and alcohol; her mental health condition has
improved; she has required no hospitalization for
mental health problems. Mother has consistently
sought treatment and has taken medication when
prescribed. Mother has found safe and stable housing,
and has managed to maintain such housing for an
extended period of time. She has terminated her
 relationship with an inappropriate, abusive partner.
She has obtained and completed services, and has for
the most part successfully completed the services
required in her service plan.
63. Unfortunately[,] serious problems remain.
Throughout the course of these proceedings, Mother has
suffered from mental health disorders which seriously
compromise her ability to provide appropriate care for
[RGB].
64. Mother suffers from a mental health
 
condition that distorts her perceptions of people and
this causes her to come into conflict with and to
 refuse to cooperate with people that are trying to
help her.
 
. . .
 
69. Mother does not understand or appreciate
the impact that her own behavior has on [RGB]. She
 accepts little responsibility for [RGB’s] problems and
instead focuses on complaints and criticisms of
others.
 
. . . 
73. When visits with Mother were finally
terminated, [RGB] was almost five. At that time,
[RGB] was a very vulnerable child who suffered from
anxiety, regressive behavior, negative psychological
symptomatololgy [sic] and general emotional
disruption. [RGB’s] psychological distress threatened
to interfere with her developmental growth and bonding
abilities. [RGB’s] psychological problems were
primarily caused by stress generated by visits with
Mother.
 
74. At the time that visits between Mother and
 
[RGB] were terminated, the visits were causing injury
to [RGB’s] psychological capacity as evidenced by a
 
5
 Several of the family court’s FsOF are misnumbered, and several
numbers appear more than once. The original numbering is preserved here. 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
substantial impairment in [RGB’s] ability to function.
Had the visits with Mother continued, [RGB] would have
suffered continued psychological harm which would have
resulted in serious injury to her, delaying physical,
emotional, social, and/or psychological development
with long term negative consequences for the child.
75. Despite numerous and extensive efforts by
many service providers and therapists, it appears
unlikely that the mother/daughter relationship between
Mother and [RGB] will improve. Returning [RGB] to
Mother’s home and care would be harmful to [RGB].
76. [RGB] is now almost six. After visits with
 
her mother terminated, [RGB’s] symptoms of
psychological distress have abated and she is doing
very well.
77. Under the circumstances presented in this
case, reasonable efforts were made by the DHS to make
it possible for [RGB] to return to her mother’s home.
78. Mother and Father [ 6]
 are not currently able
to provide [RGB] with a safe family home, even with
the assistance of a service plan. It is not
 reasonably foreseeable that either parent will become
able to provide [RGB] with a safe family home within a
reasonable period of time.

79. The proposed permanent plan is in the best
interests of [RGB].
 
The family court concluded that “[i]t is in the best
 
interests of [RGB] that permanent custody of the child be awarded
 
to DHS.” The family court ordered, in pertinent part:
 
2. Permanent custody of [RGB] is awarded to the
Department of Human Services pursuant to H.R.S. 587­
73(b)(1) and existing parental rights of Mother and
Father of [RGB] are terminated.
 
. . .
 
4. It is in [RGB’s] best interests that the
participation of Mother and Father in subsequent
hearings be limited or restricted to appearances on
any motions for relief from this decision and order or
any motions necessary to pursue an appeal.
 
. . .
 
7. G. Kay Iopa, stand-by counsel for Mother, is
discharged. Based on representations as to changes in
her resource status, if Mother wishes the assistance
of court-appointed counsel to pursue further relief or
to perfect an appeal, she must tender a new
application for court-appointed counsel to the Court
immediately.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
B. Mother’s difficulties with counsel
 
6
 Father was defaulted from the proceedings in October 2001. 
-11­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As stated in the family court’s March 11, 2005 FsOF,
 
“[t]hroughout this proceeding, Mother has had difficulties with
 
her attorneys.” Mother’s first attorney, Cynthia Linet, withdrew
 as counsel for Mother on November 30, 2001. Mother then
 proceeded pro se. However, during an April 4, 2002 hearing, the
 family court awarded DHS foster custody of RGB. Mother
 subsequently applied for court-appointed counsel on April 8,
 2002, and the family court appointed Alexander Thoene, Jr.
 (Thoene) as counsel for Mother. Mother, however, continued to
 submit documents to the court on her own behalf, including an
 Objection to Proposed Order dated April 19, 2002. 
On July 8, 2002, Mother filed a motion to dismiss
 
Thoene as counsel and to proceed pro se. In its order following
 a hearing on August 8, 2002, the family court denied Mother’s
 motion to dismiss Thoene, but allowed Mother to proceed pro se
 with Thoene as standby counsel. 
On May 15, 2003, G. Kay Iopa (Iopa) was substituted “as
 
counsel” for Mother, effective May 1, 2003. Mother continued to
 file motions on her own behalf, including a May 21, 2003
 Emergency Motion to Advance June 13, 2003 Hearing on Mother’s
 Motion to Restore Visitation. 
It appears that Mother subsequently had difficulties
 
with Iopa. On July 21, 2003, the family court held a hearing and
 issued an order that noted, “Mother can obtain a new lawyer or
 apply for court appointed counsel. If she obtains a new counsel,
 
-12­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Ms. Iopa will be [discharged].” In a hearing on July 12, 2004,
 
Mother made an oral motion for a new attorney. In its written
 order, which was not issued until March 7, 2005, the family court
 denied Mother’s oral motion and noted her objection for the
 record. The family court noted: 
[Iopa] was appointed as stand by counsel as [Mother]
wanted to represent herself. At times [Mother]
represented herself and at times relied on Ms. Iopa.
The court accepted this as the court felt it was
useful. The court has seen nothing to indicate Ms.
Iopa [has] not been effective in her representation
and notes Ms. Iopa has worked hard to assist [Mother].
Little purpose would be served to appoint a new
attorney. The new attorney would have a difficult
time getting up to speed due to the volume of
documents in this case & does not see how new counsel
 could provide better representation.
 
On September 17, 2004, Mother filed a pro se Motion for
 
Dismissal of Counsel and Continuance of September 20 [H]earing
 
and to Grant Continuance to Submit Witness Letters. Mother
 stated:
 
3. Assigned counsel, Kay Iopa, has told me
repeatedly since July 29, 2004 that “it is beyond my
scope of duties as stand-by counsel” to help locate,
contact, or interview witnesses.
4. By contrast, a) the lawyer has made
decisions without my knowledge or consent b) Kay
Iopa’s assignment to this case has caused lawyers who
were interested in this case to decline, because they
choose not to compete with the lawyer assigned as
counsel.
 
5. Affiant has enough money today to secure
independent counsel.
6. Absence of counsel would encourage new
counsel to help me conclude this case effectively, and
therefore would in fact be more time and cost
 effective.
 
7. Affiant compels the court to note that this
lawyer, and counsel preceding assigned by the court,
have neglected proper counsel or representation and
proof of my ability to work with another lawyer needs
to be considered.
 
8. Volunteer lawyer prior to that was effective
in returning my child home, then was unable to
continue pro bono.
 
. . .
 
-13­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On October 21, 2004, Mother submitted an Application
 
for Court-Appointed Counsel. A handwritten note on her
 
application states, “Application denied[.] Ms. Iopa will
 continue as stand by counsel until further order.” 
C. Subsequent proceedings
 
Following the six-day permanency plan hearing, the
 
family court issued its March 11, 2005 Termination Order, in
 
which the court discharged Iopa.
7 On March 29, 2005, Mother
 
filed an Application for Court-Appointed Counsel. The family
 court approved the application the same day, and appointed
 Carrie M. Yonemori (Yonemori) as Mother’s counsel effective
 March 29, 2005. Yonemori appears to have been appointed as
 regular, as opposed to standby, counsel. 
There are no filings in the record from either Yonemori
 
or Mother from March 29, 2005 to March 10, 2006.
8 The record is
 
silent during the intervening period, with the exception of
 several orders of the family court continuing permanent custody
 
7 In its Termination Order, the family court noted that it made its
decision to discharge Iopa “[b]ased on representations as to changes in
[Mother’s] resource status.” Although we do not have a transcript of the
proceedings to indicate what was represented to the family court, Mother’s
prior statements to the family court concerning her resources include her
September 17, 2004 Motion for Dismissal of Counsel in which she stated,
“[a]ffiant has enough money today to secure independent counsel[,]” and a
February 1, 2005 Pro Se Closing Argument and Request in which Mother stated,
“[m]y financial future is more secure based on an inheritance from my parents,
currently under probate in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.” 
8
 As explained further, infra, on March 17, 2006, Yonemori filed a
 
declaration stating that she had attempted to file a Notice of Appeal “on or
about September 30, 2005,” but that the documents were returned to her for
corrections. Yonemori asserted that she “completely forgot about making the
appropriate corrections for this case.” 
-14­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and various filings on the part of RGB’s guardian ad litem and
 
DHS. 
For example, on August 3, 2005, DHS filed a report to
 
the family court in which it noted that RGB was “doing well in
 her current placement[,]” but that Mother’s appeal “may delay the
 adoption process[.]” On August 4, 2005, RGB’s guardian ad litem
 filed a report stating that DHS would be unable to proceed with
 adoption until Mother’s appeal was resolved, and noted that
 delaying the adoption “is certainly not in the child’s best
 interest[.]” On January 17, 2006, DHS filed a report to the
 family court in which it noted that RGB “continues to do very
 well in the care of foster parents, . . . whom she has resided
 with for nearly four years.” DHS further noted that RGB’s foster
 parents were “ready to proceed with the adoption process[.]” 
On March 10, 2006, Mother filed a pro se Motion for
 
Relief from Judgment with regard to the family court’s March 11,
 2005 Termination Order, pursuant to HFCR Rule 60.
9 Mother
 
submitted an affidavit along with the motion, in which she
 declared:
 
1. I am the mother of [RGB];
2. The court made a finding to terminate my parental
rights on March 11, 2005.
3. Counsel assigned by this court remains ineffective
to bring this matter to justice;
4. The court made it’s finding based on false and
inaccurate information;
5. Based on the mistake, inadvertence, surprise,

 As discussed more fully in Part III(B), infra, HFCR Rule 60(b)
 
permits a party, within certain limitations, to seek relief from a judgment or
order for reasons of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly
discovered evidence, fraud, and “any other reason justifying relief[.]” 
-15­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
excusable neglect, fraud, misrepresentation,
professional error, misconduct and/or newly discovered
evidence, I now bring this motion.
 
On March 13, 2006, Yonemori filed a Notice of Appeal of
 
the Termination Order on Mother’s behalf.10 On March 15, 2006,
 
Yonemori also filed a Motion for Relief from the March 11, 2005
 
Order, pursuant to HFCR Rule 60, on Mother’s behalf. In
 Yonemori’s Declaration of Counsel in support of the motion, she
 asserted:
 
2. I am bringing this Motion . . . because
[Mother] believes that there has been (a) mistake,
inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect; (b) newly
discovered evidence which by due diligence could not
have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b); and (c) fraud, misrepresentations
and/or other misconduct by the state.
3. [Mother] states that the court’s final
judgment is based on false testimony and deficient
documents, some of which she was not able to properly
cross-examine, and therefore through mistake,
inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect the court has
rendered an erroneous decision which must be
 corrected.
 
4. Under-signed was appointed as counsel to
[Mother] after the ten day time allowed for in Rule
59(b) and therefore she and [Mother] did not have an
opportunity to discuss [Mother’s] concerns and/or go
through the voluminous record in this case.
5. [Mother] believes that the State’s
witnesses, documents, and testimony were fraudulent,
grossly misrepresented facts, and constituted
purposeful misconduct.
6. [Mother] has attempted to bring up these
points and arguments, as well has [sic] have her side
of the case heard, to the court in the past by [sic]
 
10 On June 28, 2006, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of
jurisdiction, stating:
 
Mother-Appellant did not file a motion for
reconsideration within twenty days after entry of the
March 11, 2005 findings of fact, conclusions of law,
and order, as [Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS)] §  571­
54 (1993) required. Therefore, Mother-Appellant
failed to perfect her right to assert an appeal under
HRS § 571-54 (1993), and there is no appealable order.
Absent an appealable order, we lack jurisdiction over
this case.
 
-16­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was prevented from doing so by her attorneys.
 
On March 17, 2006, Yonemori, on behalf of Mother, filed
 
two separate motions to extend time to file and docket the record
 
on appeal. Although both motions were file-stamped March 17,
 2006, the first was dated September 27, 2005, and the second was
 dated March 10, 2006. 
In her Declaration of Counsel accompanying the motion
 
dated September 27, 2005, Yonemori declared:
 
2. That I was unaware that a Notice of Appeal
had not been filed in the case herein. I have only
done a few Family Court DHS appeals and in all
previous cases, the prior attorney had filed the
Notice of Appeal.
 
. . .
 6. That between late March and August of this
year, I have had four (4) close family members . . .
 pass away. Therefore, I may have been preoccupied and
not as vigilant about case details.
7. That the delay in filing the Notice of
Appeal was in no way caused by the appellant, who is
understandably quite anxious about this case.
 
In her Declaration of Counsel accompanying the motion
 
dated March 10, 2006, Yonemori declared:
 
2. That on or about September 30, 2005[,] I
filed a Notice of Appeal in the case herein.
3. That sometime in October, I was notified by
Family Court Clerk Jodi Leialoha that my cover page
was in error and that the documents were being
returned to me for corrections.
 
4. That I waited for the return of the
 
documents and checked my court jacket at the Circuit
Court on a weekly basis. I did not realize that the
 documents were returned to me via my Family Court
jacket until late November.
5. That my close friend . . . passed away in
late November and I left shortly thereafter for the
mainland to attend his funeral and for sometime off.
 
6. That due to the stresses of leaving for the
mainland, holidays, and finishing up work for
EPIC/Ohana Conferencing, I completely forgot about
making the appropriate corrections for this case.
7. That the delays in filing all papers in this
case are due to my irresponsibility and are in no way
caused by the appellant, who is understandably quite
anxious about this case.
 
-17­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
. . .
 
The family court appears to have been concerned that
 
Yonemori could have a conflict of interest in representing Mother
 
in an appeal alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The
 family court held a hearing on April 6, 2006 and found that,
 “[b]ased upon [Mother’s] representations in court, the court
 finds she understands the potential conflict of interest between
 her & her current counsel & waives any conflict of interest.” 
The family court further noted, “[Mother] waives any conflict of
 interest as to her current counsel.” 
On May 23, 2006, DHS filed a report to the family
 
court, in which it noted that “[RGB] continue[d] in her
 placement” where she “has been [] since April 4, 2002[,]” that
 she “wants to remain there forever because she loves her foster
 parents whom she refers to as ‘mom’ and ‘dad[,]’” and that “she
 wants to be adopted as soon as possible[.]” 
On June 2, 2006, Mother, through Yonemori, filed a
 
document styled “Specifications on Rule 60 Motions.”
11 Yonemori
 
asserted that Mother had verbally agreed to consolidate the two
 previously-filed Rule 60 motions. Yonemori also provided some
 argument on Mother’s previous assertions that she was entitled to
 relief due to “(1) mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable
 neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence
 
11
 Although this document is file-stamped “May 33, 2006,” a hand­
written date of “June 2" appears above the stamped date. 
-18­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 
under Rule 59(b); and (3) fraud, misrepresentations and/or other
 misconduct by the state.” 
With regard to Mother’s assertion that she was entitled
 
to relief due to mistake, inadvertence and/or excusable neglect,
 Mother, through Yonemori, asserted that the court’s judgment was
 based on false or erroneous testimony and documents. Mother
 further asserted that she was prejudiced by the ineffective
 assistance of Thoene because she was only allowed to communicate
 with him in writing, and of Iopa because they disagreed as to
 case direction. Mother further asserted that Yonemori’s “failure
 to file a timely appeal and meet with [Mother] in 2005” had
 delayed resolution of the case. 
With regard to Mother’s assertion that she was entitled
 
to relief due to newly discovered evidence, Mother asserted that
 she and RGB were beneficiaries of her parents’ trust, which had
 been the subject of litigation at the time of the permanency plan
 proceedings. Mother further asserted that termination of her
 parental rights would impact RGB’s inheritance rights, and that
 any “perceived deficiencies” in Mother’s care of RGB would be
 corrected when she received the trust proceeds. 
With regard to Mother’s assertion that she was entitled
 
to relief on the basis of fraud, misrepresentations and/or
 misconduct by the State, Mother asserted that “State’s witnesses,
 documents and testimony were fraudulent, grossly misrepresented
 
-19­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
facts, and constituted purposeful misconduct.” 
Also on June 2, 2006, Yonemori filed a Motion for
 
Withdrawal and Substitution of Counsel. In Yonemori’s
 
Declaration of Counsel in support of the motion, Yonemori
 asserted:
 
2. I am bringing this Motion for Withdrawal and
Substitution of Counsel because I believe that a legal
conflict exists with my continued representation of
[Mother].
3. [Mother’s] Rule 60 motion alleges in part
ineffective assistance of counsel. I am one of the
 three attorneys who may not have effectively assisted
[Mother].
4. [Mother] verbally executed a waiver of
conflict with me at the last court hearing.
5. I do not want to see [Mother] prejudiced in
anyway [sic] by her waiver and I have spoken to her
about the importance of preserving all possible
grounds of appeal. [Mother] stated that it was not
her intent that this waiver be “permanent.”
 
. . . 
10. [Mother] is in contact with an attorney (in
California, but also still actively licensed in
Hawaii) who has excellent foresight and understanding
about this case. I have also spoken with him about
the pending Rule 60 motion and possible appeal. It is
 my recommendation that the court consider appointing
this individual as [Mother’s] counsel.
 
The family court held a hearing on June 2, 2006 and, in
 
its corresponding June 26, 2006 order, found that “due to
 
[Mother’s] current appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction to act
 on her Rule 60(b) motion and motion for withdrawal and
 substitution of counsel[.]” The court “[held] in abeyance any
 ruling on [Mother’s] Rule 60(b) motion or motion for withdrawal
 and substitution unless moved on; and directs her and her counsel
 to address these to the appellate court.” On June 28, 2006, this
 court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See n.10,
 
supra. 
-20­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Subsequently, on September 28, 2006, the family court
 
orally denied the motions for relief and Yonemori’s motion to
 
withdraw. On October 17, 2006, prior to the issuance of the
 family court’s written order, Mother appealed pro se from the
 family court’s oral announcement denying her motions for relief. 
The ICA dismissed Mother’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction,
 “because the family court ha[d] not reduced the September 28,
 2006 oral announcement to an appealable written order.” 
On November 9, 2006, the family court issued its
 
written order, denying Mother’s pro se motion and Yonemori’s
 motion for relief, as well as Yonemori’s motion for withdrawal
 and substitution of counsel. The court found that Yonemori’s
 motion for relief was untimely. With regard to Mother’s pro se
 motion, the family court found:
 
(1) the motion only requests general relief and Rule
60(b) requires particularity with respect to [] some
of the relief being sought in this motion; (2) the
motion fails to provide any new evidence to support a
basis for relief under Rule 60(b), Hawaii Family Court
Rules; (3) as to the relief sought, the court afforded
Mother . . . extensive time at trial to present
evidence to support the relief currently being
requested and to address all of the issues for which
relief is being sought in this motion; (3) [sic] the
court appointed legal counsels to assist Mother . . .
to the extent she was willing to work with the legal
counsels appointed; (4) Rule 6, Hawaii Family Court
Rules does not permit the court to extend or enlarge
the time within which to bring this motion and the
court will not enlarge or extend the time within which
this motion can be brought; and (5) the time within
which to bring this motion has been long outstanding
causing delay in the final resolution of the case and
this matter needs to be put to rest[.] 
The family court also found:
 
Mother[’s] . . . parental rights have been terminated
and due to this status and the possibility of
 
-21­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
dissemination of these confidential records, the court
finds that future court records are not currently
available to Mother . . . ; provided however that
court records will be made available for any appellate
review of this decision.
 
Mother did not appeal the family court’s written order.
 
On February 6, 2007, Mother’s new counsel, James
 
12
Ireijo,  filed a motion in the family court for “1) New Trial,
and/or 2) To Reconsider and/or Amend Judgment and/or All Previous
 Orders, and/or 3) For Release of All Evidence or Files in Case,
 and/or 4) For Dismissal.” The motion cited HFCR Rule 7(b), and
 was supported by a Declaration of Counsel, which asserted that
 Mother was not afforded competent legal counsel during several
 “pivotal” moments in the case, and was therefore denied her due
 process rights and equal protection of the law under the United
 States and Hawai
'i Constitutions. Specifically, the declaration 
alleged that Mother was not represented by competent counsel and
 was denied her due process rights by:
 
the Order Denying Mother’s Motion to Reconsider Denial
of Oral Motion To Continue Trial; and Exclusion of
Exhibits Filed December 23, 2004, filed on March 7,
2005,[ 
13] 
and/or, the Order Denying Mother’s Motion to
 
12
 It is unclear from the record when or how Yonemori withdrew from
 
the case. 
13 On December 23, 2004, Mother filed a Motion to Reconsider Denial
of Oral Motion to Continue Trial, and Exclusion of Exhibits. Mother requested
that the court “[c]ontinue the evidentiary portion of the proceedings to allow
MOTHER to call additional witnesses, whose identities have been previously
disclosed[,]” and “[t]o allow the admission into evidence, audio tapes
prepared by MOTHER of parent/child visits and MOTHER’s interactions with
service providers.” Mother’s motion was supported by a Declaration of
Counsel, in which Iopa attested:
 
. . .
 2. MOTHER has strongly expressed her
dissatisfaction with the extent of information before
 the Court;
3. MOTHER wishes to bring additional witnesses,
 
-22­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Reinstate Visitation Filed January 11, 2005, filed on
March 7, 2005,
[14 
] and/or at the time of entry of the
Court’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
filed on March 11, 2005. 
(Emphasis in original). 
The Declaration further asserted: 
[Mother] did not have competent or any counsel when
her child was permanently removed or taken away by
Order on March 11, 2005, thus, the lack thereafter of
a fair and legal opportunity to have further evidence
considered or not considered, as well as losing her
right to appeal due to severe time constraints. 
The Declaration did not specify what error, if any,
 
occurred during the permanency plan hearing. The Declaration
 
further asserted that denying Mother access to records available
 to the appellate court was “a direct violation of the right to
 due process[.]” 
DHS filed a memorandum in opposition to Mother’s motion
 
on April 23, 2007. DHS objected to Mother’s motion for relief as
 untimely and asserted that the motion lacked merit because “the
 record reflects that during the course of the case, Mother
 dictated who would represent her and how they would represent her
 
introduce audio tapes and augment her previous
testimony;
4. MOTHER’s desire is to provide the Court with
a proper basis for its decision and to ensure a
complete record; and
5. MOTHER seeks this additional opportunity as
an accommodation for her established disability.
 
The family court issued its written denial of Mother’s motion on
March 7, 2005. 
14
 On January 11, 2005, Mother filed a Motion to Reinstate
Visitation. Mother’s motion was supported by a Declaration of Counsel, in
which Iopa stated that Mother was receiving care from Care Hawai' i and had 
been prescribed medication for anxiety, and that the YMCA was willing tosupervise visits between Mother and RGB. The family court issued its writtendenial of Mother’s motion on March 7, 2005. 
-23­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and the court tried it’s [sic] best to accommodate Mother and to
 
ensure she had assistance even when she desired to represent
 herself pro se.” DHS further asserted that “until the time
 Mother’s parental rights were terminated, she had access to the
 court’s records and files and any appeal would have been
 predicated upon the record up to the point of such
 termination.”
15
 
DHS argued that, “[a]t all relevant times herein Mother
 
had competent representation, in that the court appointed counsel
 for Mother, or permitted Mother to proceed pro se if she could or
 appointed standby counsel to assist Mother in her case up and
 through the permanent plan hearing trial.” DHS further argued
 that “Rule 60(b) should be used only where the relief will
 further justice without adversely affecting substantial rights of
 the parties. . . . it is clear the relief sought by this motion
 would adversely affect the child’s substantial rights, and
 justice would not be served.” 
On April 24, 2007, more than two years after the filing
 
of its Termination Order, the family court held a hearing on
 Mother’s motion. The court denied the motion and all relief
 therein requested. The family court issued its written order on
 May 8, 2007, finding: 
15
 As discussed further, supra, it appears that Mother had full
 
access to the court records in this case until a September 28, 2006 hearing
before the family court, following which the family court issued its
November 9, 2006 order restricting prospectively Mother’s access to court
records. 
-24­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A. As to Mothers [sic] claim that Mother lacked
representation, the record clearly reflects that both
Judges involved in this case made great effort to have
Mother represented throughout the proceedings. The
 court accommodated Mother when she requested to have
her counsel discharged and had standby counsel
appointed to assist Mother throughout the case, all of
which is reflected in the court’s prior ruling
contained in it’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
and Order filed March 11, 2005;
 
B. The court adopts all of the facts, law and reasons
cited in DHS’ Memorandum in Opposition [to Mother’s
motion] . . .
 
On June 7, 2007, Mother filed a Notice of Appeal of the
 
family court’s May 8, 2007 order denying relief. 
D. ICA Appeal
 
In her Opening Brief to the ICA, Mother, citing Mathews
 
v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) and Lassiter v. Department of
 
Social Services, 452 U.S. 18 (1981), argued that the family court
 denied her constitutional due process rights by failing to
 provide her with competent counsel. Mother further argued that,
 because she did not have appointed counsel until “a mere 12 days
 before [Mother’s] appeal period would run. . . . she lost her
 opportunity to have evidence reconsidered and effectively lost
 her right to file a timely appeal.” Mother also argued that, by
 refusing to allow her to review the confidential records in this
 case, the family court deprived her of her due process right to a
 fair trial. Mother requested that the matter be remanded for “a
 new trial with competent counsel present at all stages of her new
 proceeding to prove that she is a competent and fit parent that
 has the ability to provide a safe family home.” (Emphasis in
 
-25­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
original). 
In its Answering Brief, DHS argued that the family
 
court did not abuse its discretion in its May 8, 2007 order
 
denying relief. DHS argued that Mother’s February 6, 2007 motion
 was not timely, because “it was not filed within one (1) year of
 the March 11, 2005 order terminating Mother’s parental rights.” 
DHS further argued that “there was no new evidence which would
 serve as a basis to re-open the case[,]” and that “Mother failed
 to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been
 presented at trial[.]” 
DHS also argued that Mother’s assertion that she was
 
denied access to the record was without merit, because “the court
 did not prohibit Mother’s access to records until September 28,
 2006, . . . which was a year and a half after her parental rights
 were terminated, and six months beyond the time Mother would be
 permitted to file a Rule 60, HFCR motion . . . .” Finally, DHS
 argued that the analysis of Eldridge and Lassiter was
 inapplicable, because Mother “had counsel at all times during the
 pendency of this case[,]” and because she could not demonstrate
 substantial prejudice. In response to Mother’s claim that she
 was denied time for her appellate counsel to file an appeal, DHS
 argued that “based upon the facts, it is Mother’s own actions
 which caused a delay.” 
Mother subsequently filed a Reply Brief arguing: 
Her attorney selected by the trial court was appointed
so late that it was clearly foreseeable that the 30
 
-26­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
day appeal period would run. The responsibility in
initially correcting this problem laid with Judge
Gaddis, who initiated and created the problem at
Mother’s expense. . . . Judge Gaddis could have made
the appointment of new counsel while extending the due
date to file a Notice of Appeal. Instead, he made a
very late appointment of new counsel and jeopardized
the legal and appeal interests of Mother. The trial
judge not only filed an order against Mother, he
failed to also protect Mother’s concomitant due
process interests in ensuring that she would be able
to timely file a new Notice of Appeal. This is a
 
clear violation of the due process rights of Mother
that was easily preventable by the trial court.
 
(Emphasis in original).
 
Mother further asserted that “[a]s the trial court is
 
responsible for timely appointing counsel, the court could have
 
very easily extended the appeal due date or forewarned counsel of
 
a pending notice of appeal due date.” (Emphasis in original). 
In its April 9, 2009 Summary Disposition Order (SDO),
 
the ICA concluded that “the [f]amily [c]ourt did not err in
 declining to grant Mother relief based on ineffective assistance
 of counsel.” In re RGB, No. 28582, 2009 WL 953392 at *2 (App.
 
Apr. 9, 2009). The ICA further noted that “[f]rom Mother’s
 point-of-view, this appeal concerns the termination of her
 parental rights with respect to her child . . . . However, the
 Termination Order is not before the court on this appeal.” Id.
 
at *1. 
With regard to Mother’s claim of ineffective assistance
 
of counsel during the pre-termination period, the ICA noted:
 
Mother fails to identify with specificity, however, at
which points in the case that she was
unconstitutionally deprived of access to competent
counsel. It appears from the record that Mother was
represented by appointed counsel or standby consulting
counsel at all hearings leading up to the Termination
 
-27­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Order. . . . More importantly, . . . Mother does not
identify any specific error or omission of counsel
during the events and proceedings which culminated in
the Termination Order.
 
Id. at *2. 
With respect to the post-termination time frame, the
 
ICA noted:
 
[T]his court is troubled by the impact of the
Termination Order’s immediate discharge of Mother’s
standby attorney, particularly in light of the
[f]amily [c]ourt’s assessment of Mother’s mental
health status . . . That said, Mother has not
identified to this court a single “appealable issue”
that could have been raised had counsel preserved her
rights to an appeal from the Termination Order. 
Id. 
The ICA concluded by stating:
 
We consider, by analogy, the standard that is applied
to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate
counsel in criminal matters. . . . In this case,
Mother has failed to even suggest a meritorious basis
upon which counsel could have filed a motion to
reconsider and could have raised on appeal from the
Termination Order. For these reasons, we conclude
that the Family Court did not err in declining to
grant Mother relief based on ineffective assistance of
counsel.
 
Id. (Citation omitted).
 
With regard to Mother’s claim that her due process
 
rights were violated by being denied access to the record in this
 
case, the ICA held:
 
This limitation appears to be supported by HRS §
587-73(b)(4) (2006) and is grounded in the Family
Court’s prior final decision that Mother had no
further parental rights or interests in the
proceedings. Mother has not informed this court of
 any documents or category of documents that she
reasonably requested access to or why she needs full
access to the post-November 6, 2006 record in this
 case. Mother has failed to identify any prejudice
stemming from this limitation. . . . We conclude that
the Circuit Court did not err in limiting Mother’s
access to the post-November 6, 2006 confidential
 
-28­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
record in this case.
 
Id. at *3. 
The ICA filed its judgment affirming the family court’s
 
May 8, 2007 order on May 21, 2009. Mother timely filed an
 
application for writ of certiorari on August 13, 2009. DHS filed
 its response on August 28, 2009. 
In her application, Mother “request[ed] the Court to
 
apply or formulate a family court standard of the correct remedy
 for ‘ineffective assistance of counsel’ and if found, to grant a
 new trial.” Mother further asserted that “[i]t is legally
 impossible to raise any points until the records are released for
 review.” 
In its Objection, DHS argued that the ICA’s analogy to
 
the criminal standard for ineffective assistance of counsel was
 appropriate. DHS further argued that Mother had full access to
 all records upon which an appeal would have been based. 
II. Standard of Review
 
The family court’s denial of a motion under HFCR Rule 
60(b)(6) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Pratt v. Pratt, 
104 Hawai
'i 37, 42, 84 P.3d 545, 550 (2004). As the ICA noted in 
Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. 286, 666 P.2d 171 (1983): 
[s]ince Rule 60(b)(6) relief is contrary to the
general rule favoring finality of actions, the court
must carefully weigh all of the conflicting
considerations inherent in such applications. Once
 the court has made a determination to grant or deny
relief, the exercise of its discretion will not be set
aside unless the appellate court is persuaded that,
under the circumstances of the case, the court abused
its discretion.

An “abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court 
has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.” Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai
'i 202, 211, 159 
P.3d 814, 823 (2007) (quoting Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. 
State, 110 Hawai 'i 338, 351, 133 P.3d 767, 780 (2006)). In 
addition, “[t]he burden of establishing abuse of discretion is on 
appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it.” State v. Hinton, 120 Hawai
'i 265, 273, 204 P.3d 484, 492 (2009) 
(quoting State v. Wong, 97 Hawai 'i 512, 517, 40 P.3d 914, 919 
(2002)). 
III. Discussion
 
In Mother’s February 6, 2007 motion, Mother asserted 
that she was deprived of effective assistance of counsel in both the pre- and post-termination proceedings, in violation of her due process and equal protection rights under the United States and Hawai
'i Constitutions. For the reasons set forth below, we 
construe Mother’s motion as a HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief and conclude that the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. 
A.	 The family court properly concluded that Mother had a due
process right to appointed counsel during the termination
proceedings 
The United States Constitution does not require the
 
-30­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
appointment of counsel in all proceedings involving the potential
 
for termination of parental rights. Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 31. 
Rather, due process requires that “[a] parent’s interest in the
 accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her
 parental status” be balanced against the State’s interest in the
 welfare of the child and the economy of the proceedings, as well
 as against the risk that “a parent will be erroneously deprived
 of his or her child because the parent is not represented by
 counsel.” Id. at 27-28 (citing Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 335). In
 
Lassiter, the Court held that:
 
[t]he dispositive question . . . is whether the three
Eldridge factors,[ 16
] when weighed against the
presumption that there is no right to appointed
counsel in the absence of at least a potential
deprivation of physical liberty, suffice to rebut that
presumption and thus to lead to the conclusion that
the Due Process Clause requires the appointment of
counsel when a State seeks to terminate an indigent’s
parental status.
 
Id. at 31.
 
This court has not determined whether article 1, 
section 5 of the Hawai 'i Constitution affords parents a due 
process right to counsel in all termination proceedings.17 
However, in In re Doe, 99 Hawai 'i 522, 533, 57 P.3d 447, 458 
(2002) (citation omitted), we held that article 1, section 5 of 
16
 In determining what due process requires under Eldridge, the court
 
must consider “the private interests at stake, the government’s interest, and
the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions.” See
 
Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 27. 
17
 Article 1, section 5 of the Hawai' i Constitution provides that
“[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without dueprocess of law, nor be denied the equal protection of the laws[.]” 
-31­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Hawai 'i Constitution provides parents a “substantive liberty 
interest in the care, custody, and control of their children,” 
independent of the United States Constitution, and that the state must provide parents “a fair procedure” for the deprivation of that liberty interest. 
In Doe, we concluded that “parents who are in need of
 
an interpreter because of their inability to understand English
 are entitled to the assistance of one at any family court hearing
 in which their parental rights are substantially affected.” Id.
 
at 526, 57 P.3d at 451. We further concluded that the
 determination of whether parental rights are substantially
 affected, such that due process is implicated, must be made on a
 case-by-case basis. Id. at 534, 57 P.3d at 459 (citing Lassiter,
 
452 U.S. at 32). 
Under the circumstances of Doe, however, we concluded
 
that the Appellant-Mother had failed to demonstrate her need for
 an interpreter, and failed to demonstrate that she was
 “substantially prejudiced” by the absence of an interpreter. Id.
 
at 526, 57 P.3d at 451. Accordingly, we affirmed the order of
 the circuit court, which granted foster custody of the children
 to DHS. Id. 
In In re “A” Children, 119 Hawai
'i 28, 46, 193 P.3d 
1228, 1246 (App. 2008), the ICA noted that the appointment of counsel remains discretionary under HRS § 587-34, which provides, in pertinent part: 
-32­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Guardian ad litem; court appointed counsel. (a) The
court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child
to serve throughout the pendency of the child
protective proceedings under this chapter. The court
 may appoint additional counsel for the child pursuant
to subsection (c) or independent counsel for any other
party if the party is an indigent, counsel is
necessary to protect the party’s interests adequately,
and the interests are not represented adequately by
another party who is represented by counsel.
 
HRS § 587-34 (2006)(emphasis added). 
The ICA therefore applied the case-by-case approach 
adopted in Lassiter, and concluded that a father was deprived of 
his due process right to appointed counsel under the United States Constitution, where counsel was not appointed until two weeks before the termination proceedings. 119 Hawai
'i at 59-60, 
193 P.3d at 1259-60. Although the ICA expressed “grave concerns” about the case-by-case approach, it declined to adopt a bright-line rule requiring appointment of counsel for indigent parents in all termination proceedings. Id. 
In this case, the family court immediately appointed
 
counsel upon Mother’s initial application. Thereafter, Mother
 was represented at all times by counsel or standby counsel,
 except when Mother expressly requested to proceed pro se, and
 during the period between March 11, 2005 (when the family court
 discharged Iopa in its Termination Order) and March 28, 2005
 (when the family court appointed Yonemori). Thus, in electing to
 appoint counsel, it appears that the family court applied the
 Lassiter balancing test, and concluded that the balance of
 interests required that counsel be appointed for Mother in order
 
-33­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to satisfy the demands of due process under the United States
 
Constitution. We conclude, with respect to those aspects of the
 proceedings that Mother seeks to challenge here, that the family
 court’s determination was correct given the risk that failure to
 appoint counsel would lead to an erroneous decision. See
 
Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 27. 
Because the family court properly determined that 
Mother had a right to counsel under the United States Constitution, we decline to reach the question of whether the Hawai
'i Constitution provides indigent parents a right to counsel 
in all termination proceedings.18 
B.	 HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) is, in the circumstances of this case, a
proper vehicle for raising ineffective assistance of counsel
in proceedings concerning the termination of parental rights
 
This appeal requires us to consider whether HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(6) (hereinafter “Rule 60(b)(6)”) is an appropriate vehicle
 
for raising ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings
 concerning the termination of parental rights. We note at the
 outset that Mother’s February 6, 2007 motion to the trial court,
 styled a “Motion for 1) New Trial and/or 2) to Reconsider and/or
 Amend Judgment and/or All Previous Orders, and/or 3) for Release
 of all Evidence or Files in Case, and/or 4) for Dismissal[,]”
 
18
 We therefore respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion
that we hereby “den[y] indigent persons access to justice in parental
termination actions” or that we have adopted a “discretionary appointment
approach[.]” Dissenting Opinion at 1, 46. We recognize instead that, becausethe family court properly determined that Mother had a due process right to
appointed counsel under the U.S. Constitution, the determination of whatprotections the Hawai' i Constitution provides to indigent parents is not
properly before us. 
-34­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
stated only that she sought relief pursuant to HFCR Rule 7(b),
 
which is a general rule regarding pleadings and the form of
 motions. However, in Mother’s Opening Brief to the ICA, she
 asserted that the “standard of review for a denial of a motion
 for post-decree relief is the abuse of discretion standard.” In
 her Reply Brief, Mother described the “motion herein” as one
 under Rule 60(b). Because a Rule 60(b)(6) motion appears to have
 been the only motion for post-decree relief available to Mother
 
19 
under the applicable rules, and because the family court and
the ICA both appeared to construe Mother’s motion as a Rule

 
60(b)(6) motion, we review Mother’s assertions under the
 principles applicable to Rule 60(b)(6) motions. 
1. Principles applicable to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motions
 
“Rule 60(b)(6) permits the trial court in its sound
 
discretion to relieve a party from a final judgment.” Hayashi, 4
 
Haw. App. at 290, 666 P.2d at 174 (citing Isemoto Contracting Co.
 
v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 205, 616 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1980)). 
19 At the time the Termination Order was filed, it was subject to
appeal only following the family court’s decision on a motion for
reconsideration, which was required to be filed within twenty days of the
entry of the order. HRS § 571-54 (2005). However, a 2006 amendment to HRS §
571-54, which was designed to “speed the resolution of child protective
services cases,” eliminated the requirement that a motion for reconsideration
precede an appeal. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2245, in 2006 Senate Journal, at
1132. Nevertheless, HFCR Rule 72(b) requires that a notice of appeal be filed
within 30 days of a final decision or order. Accordingly, a direct appeal was
not available to Mother at the time she filed her February 6, 2007 motion.
Similarly, a motion for new trial was no longer available to Mother,
because HFCR Rule 59(b) requires that a motion for new trial be made within 10
days after the entry of judgment. In addition, a motion for relief from
judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), (2), or (3) must be made not more than one year
following judgment, and thus was no longer available to Mother. Finally,
although relief under Rule 60(b)(4) and (5) is not subject to the one-year
limitation, those rules do not appear to have been applicable to Mother’s
circumstances.
 
-35­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HFCR Rule 60(b) provides, in pertinent part:
 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court
may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative
from any or all of the provisions of a final judgment,
order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1)
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence
could not have been discovered in time to move for a
 new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud . . . ,
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse
party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has
been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior
judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or
otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that
the judgment should have prospective application; or
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made
 within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2),
and (3) not more than one year after the judgment,
order, or proceedings was entered or taken. 
(Emphasis added). 
Although this court has not addressed the requirements
 
for bringing a HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motion, the ICA has explained
 
that, under HFCR Rule 60(b)(6), a movant must meet three
 threshold requirements:
 
the movant must show that (1) the motion is based on
some reason other than those specifically stated in
clauses 60(b)(1) through (5); (2) the reason urged is
such as to justify the relief; and (3) the motion is
made within a reasonable time.
 
The first requirement is self-explanatory and
merely indicates that subsection (6) is a residual
clause to provide relief for considerations not
covered by the preceding five clauses. The second
 requirement means that the movant must prove that
there are exceptional circumstances justifying relief.
The third requirement calls for diligence by the
moving party. Although Rule 60(b)(6) motions are not
subject to the one-year limitation, they must be
brought within a reasonable time. What constitutes a
 “reasonable time” is determined in the light of all
attendant circumstances, intervening rights, loss of
evidence, prejudice to the adverse party, the
commanding equities of the case, and the general
policy that judgments be final.
Since Rule 60(b)(6) relief is contrary to the
general rule favoring finality of actions, the court
must carefully weigh all of the conflicting
considerations inherent in such applications. 
-36­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290-91, 666 P.2d at 174-5 (internal
 
citations omitted).
 
In Hayashi, the ICA considered whether a six-year delay
 
in filing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion was justified by any
 “exceptional circumstances” which would “mitigate the lengthy
 delay in bringing the motion.” 4 Haw. App. at 291, 666 P.2d at
 175. Hayashi involved Wife’s allegation that Husband’s coercion
 
led her to execute a property settlement agreement (PSA) upon
 their divorce. Id. at 288, 666 P.2d at 173. In her HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(6) motion seeking relief from the PSA, Wife claimed that
 “before and after execution of the PSA and entry of the decree,
 Husband exerted extreme influence over her so that she was acting
 under coercion and emotional duress when she signed the PSA[,]”
 and that “her dominated situation created the extraordinary
 circumstances justifying relief.” Id. at 291, 666 P.2d at 175. 
The family court found no evidence of extraordinary
 
circumstances in the record to justify Wife’s six-year delay in
 filing an HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motion. Id. The ICA agreed, and
 
noted that Wife had failed to prove the existence of
 extraordinary circumstances because she had been represented at
 all times by legal counsel who was able to protect her from any
 coercive action, and because she had consulted with several other
 lawyers prior to signing the PSA. Id. Thus, while a six-year
 
delay in filing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion was not per se
 unreasonable, Wife’s motion was deemed untimely. Id. 
-37­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Accordingly, the ICA held that the family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in denying Wife’s motion. Id. 
Moreover, in Nakata v. Nakata, 3 Haw. App. 51, 56, 641
 
P.2d 333, 336 (App. 1982), the ICA held that HFCR Rule 60(b)(6)
 “should be used only where the relief will further justice
 without adversely affecting substantial rights of the parties.”
 (citing 11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal
 Practice and Procedure: Civil §§ 2857, 2864 (1st ed. 1973)). The
 ICA further held that HFCR Rule 60(b) is not intended to
 “reliev[e] a party from free, calculated, and deliberate choices
 he, she, or it has made.” Id. at 56, 641 P.2d at 336 (citing 11
 
Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and
 Procedure: Civil § 2864 (1st ed. 1973); 46 Am. Jur. 2d,
 Judgments, § 688 (1969)). 
In what the ICA construed to be a HFCR Rule 60(b)
 
motion, id. at 55, 641 P.2d at 336, Wife sought relief from a
 divorce decree that gave Husband the option to purchase the
 marital residence at the conclusion of a six-month period if Wife
 failed to comply with a payoff provision, id. at 52-53, 641 P.2d
 at 334-35. Wife argued that “the court had the power to and
 should extend the six months to allow her to purchase the house
 upon the favorable terms stated in the decree[,]” id. at 53, 641
 P.2d at 335, and the family court granted her relief. Id. at 53­
54, 641 P.2d at 335. However, the ICA deemed Wife’s HFCR Rule
 60(b) claim “excessive,” and concluded that the family court
 
-38­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
abused its discretion in granting Wife relief. Id. at 51, 56,
 
641 P.2d at 334, 336. 
2.	 The use of Rule 60(b)(6) as a vehicle to raise
ineffective assistance of counsel in termination of
 parental rights cases
 
A majority of states now routinely appoint counsel for
 
indigent parents in termination of parental rights cases, and
 
have concluded that the right to counsel includes a right to
 effective counsel. See Susan Calkins, Ineffective Assistance of
 
Counsel in Parental-Rights Termination Cases: The Challenge for
 Appellate Courts, 6 J. App. Prac. & Process 179, 193-99 (2004). 
However, state courts have struggled to determine the proper
 procedural vehicle for raising ineffective assistance of counsel
 in termination of parental rights proceedings. See id. at 199.
 
A majority of jurisdictions has concluded that direct
 
appeal is the most appropriate method for raising ineffective
 assistance of counsel in termination proceedings, due to the
 particular need for expeditious resolution and finality in child
 custody disputes. See, e.g., State ex rel. Juvenile Dep’t of
 
Multnomah County v. Geist, 796 P.2d 1193, 1201 (Or. 1990); In re
 James W.H., 849 P.2d 1079, 1080 (N.M. Ct. App. 1993); N.J. Div.
 of Youth & Family Servs. v. B.R., 929 A.2d 1034, 1040 (N.J.
 2007). Where an appeal of an order terminating parental rights
 has not been timely filed, some jurisdictions allow for an
 enlargement of the time for filing an appeal upon a showing of
 good cause. See, e.g., In re A.J., 143 P.3d 1143, 1146 (Colo.
 
-39­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Ct. App. 2006). 
California allows a parent to raise ineffective
 
assistance of counsel in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 
In re Paul W., 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 329, 333 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007)
 (citing In re Kristin H., 54 Cal. Rptr. 2d 722, 725 (Cal. Ct.
 App. 1996)). However, other jurisdictions have concluded that
 habeas corpus is not the appropriate vehicle to collaterally
 attack a judgment terminating parental rights on the basis of
 ineffective assistance of counsel because it would increase
 uncertainty in child custody proceedings and thereby limit the
 possibility of adoption. See, e.g., In re Jonathan M., 764 A.2d
 
739, 751-52 (Conn. 2001); see also Lehman v. Lycoming County
 Children’s Servs. Agency, 458 U.S. 502, 513-14 (1982) (holding
 that federal habeas corpus may not be used to litigate
 constitutional issues in child-custody matters because “[t]he
 State’s interest in finality is unusually strong in child-custody
 disputes. The grant of federal habeas would prolong uncertainty
 for children . . . possibly lessening their chances of
 adoption.”).
 
Finally, some jurisdictions allow a claim of
 
ineffective assistance of counsel to be raised under rules
 similar to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6). See Ex parte E.D., 777 So.2d 113
 
(Ala. 2000); In re Georgette, 768 N.E.2d 549, 557 (Mass. App. Ct.
 2002). In Ex parte E.D., the Alabama Supreme Court held that “a
 [Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure (ARCP)] Rule 60(b) motion,
 
-40­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under certain circumstances, . . . can be an appropriate means by
 
which a parent facing the termination of parental rights can
 present claims of ineffective assistance of appointed counsel.” 
777 So.2d at 116. In that case, a mother’s parental rights were
 terminated, and her trial counsel subsequently withdrew from the
 
case. Id. at 114. The court appointed a new attorney for the
 
purpose of appeal and, on appeal, the Alabama Court of Civil
 Appeals affirmed the termination order. Id. Less than 60 days
 
later, the mother filed a motion pursuant to ARCP Rule 60(b)(6),
 alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Id. 
ARCP Rule 60(b)(6) is nearly identical to HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(6), and “permits a civil litigant to collaterally attack a
 civil judgment” within a “reasonable time.” Id. at 116. The
 
Alabama Supreme Court concluded that:
 
[w]hat constitutes a “reasonable time” depends on the
facts of each case, taking into consideration the
interest of finality, the reason for the delay, the
practical ability to learn earlier of the grounds
relied upon, and the prejudice to other parties.
 
Id. (quoting Ex parte W.J., 622 So.2d 358, 361 (Ala. 1993)
 
(quotation marks omitted)).
 
Weighing the “drastic effect of the termination of
 
parental rights against the need for finality in the ultimate
 disposition of questions regarding parental rights[,]” the
 Alabama Supreme Court held that the mother’s Rule 60(b)(6)
 motion, filed within 60 days of the appellate court’s judgment
 affirming the termination order, was filed within a “reasonable
 
-41­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
-42-time.”  Id.
In contrast, in In re Georgette, the Appeals Court of
Massachusetts noted that a motion raising ineffective assistance
of trial counsel and made pursuant to Massachusetts Rule of Civil
Procedure (MRCP) Rule 60(b)(6) “should be granted only in
extraordinary circumstances, which are not present when the
allegedly aggrieved party could have reasonably sought relief by
means of direct appeal.”  768 N.E.2d at 557.  In that case, a
father’s parental rights were terminated, and his two daughters
brought a MRCP Rule 60(b)(6) motion for a new trial, alleging
that their appointed trial counsel was ineffective.  Id. at 551. 
Although the court did not expressly reject MRCP Rule 60(b)(6) as
a vehicle for raising ineffective assistance of counsel, it
rejected the daughters’ motion as an “improper effort to obtain
relief.”  Id. at 557.  The court further noted that:
If cases are to have finality, the operation of rule
60(b) must receive “extremely meagre scope.”  Rule 60
is to litigation what mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is
to first aid: a life-saving treatment, applicable in
desperate cases.  Achieving finality and minimizing
delay and uncertainty are appropriate considerations
when acting on any rule 60(b) motion; they are prime
considerations . . . when the rights, interests, and
welfare of children in custody and adoption
proceedings are involved.
Id. at 557-558 (quotation marks, ellipses and citations omitted).
Recognizing that Mother cannot pursue any other avenue
of relief here, we conclude that Rule 60(b)(6) was an appropriate
vehicle for raising ineffective assistance of counsel in the  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circumstances of this case.20
 
C.	 We will review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel
 
in termination of parental rights cases to determine whether
fundamental fairness was compromised
 
State courts have also applied varying tests for
 
determining whether appointed counsel in a termination of
 
parental rights case was ineffective. A majority of states has
 adopted the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel in
 criminal cases that was announced in Strickland v. Washington,
 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984): “First, the defendant must show that
 counsel’s performance was deficient. . . . Second, the defendant
 must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the
 defense.”
21 See, e.g., State v. T.L., 751 N.W.2d 677, 685 (N.D.
 
20 We note that RGB has not yet been adopted, and that this case is
distinguishable from one in which adoption has already occurred. Our
 
conclusion therefore does not authorize a challenge to the termination of
parental rights based on ineffective assistance of counsel in a case where
adoption of the child has already taken place.
 
21 In State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 615 P.2d 101 (1980), we 
articulated the standard under the Hawai' i constitution for reviewing
ineffective assistance of counsel claims in criminal cases as follows: 
The burden of establishing ineffective assistance of
counsel rests upon the appellant. His burden is
 twofold: First, the appellant must establish specific
errors or omissions of defense counsel reflecting
counsel’s lack of skill, judgment or diligence.
Second, the appellant must establish that these errors
or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or
 substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense.
 
Id. at 348-49, 615 P.2d at 104 (citations omitted); see Dan v. State, 76Hawai'i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (“no showing of ‘actual’ prejudice
is required to prove ineffective assistance of counsel” in a criminal case)(quoting Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 464, 848 P.2d 966, 977 (1993)).
With regard to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in the
criminal context, this court has held that, “[i]f . . . an appealable issue is
omitted as a result of the performance of counsel whose competence fell below
that required of attorneys in criminal cases then appellant’s counsel is
constitutionally ineffective.” Briones, 74 Haw. at 467, 848 P.2d at 978.
Where appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness results in the failure to timely
 
-43­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2008); N.J. Div. of Youth & Family Servs. v. B.R., 929 A.2d 1034,
 
1038 (N.J. 2007); In re C.H., 166 P.3d 288, 290-91 (Colo. Ct.
 App. 2007). Aside from cases in which prejudice is presumed,
22
 
courts applying the Strickland standard in termination of
 parental rights cases rarely find ineffectiveness. Calkins, 6 J.
 App. Prac. & Process at 215. 
Other jurisdictions apply the “fundamental fairness”
 
test announced in State ex rel. Juvenile Department of Multnomah
 County v. Geist, 796 P.2d 1193, 1204 (Or. 1990), which required a
 mother whose parental rights were terminated to show “not only
 that her trial counsel was inadequate, but also that any
 inadequacy prejudiced her cause to the extent that she was denied
 a fair trial and, therefore, that the justice of the circuit
 court’s decision is called into serious question.” In declining
 to apply the Strickland standard, the Geist court distinguished
 juvenile court proceedings from adult criminal proceedings,
 noting that “[t]here simply is no compelling reason that the same
 standards applied in adult criminal cases also should be applied
 in juvenile cases.” Id. at 1202; see also Baker v. Marion County
 
file a notice of an appeal, this court has, under certain circumstances,
“relax[ed] the deadline for filing a notice of appeal.” State v. Shinyama, 
101 Hawai' i 389, 393 n.6, 69 P.3d 517, 521 n.6 (2003); see also State v.
Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 316, 615 P.2d 91, 96 (1980) (permitting a late-filedappeal where defendant had withdrawn his initial appeal based on counsel’serroneous advice). 
22
 For example, the Court of Appeals of Kansas has held that an
attorney’s withdrawal mid-trial constituted a complete denial of counsel, and
therefore prejudice was presumed. In re Rushing, 684 P.2d 445, 450 (Kan. Ct.
 
App. 1984). As discussed further, infra, failure to file a notice of appeal
in a criminal proceeding may be per se prejudicial under certain
circumstances.

Office of Family & Children, 810 N.E.2d 1035, 1039 (Ind. 2004)
 
(“We conclude that transporting the structure of the criminal
 law, featuring as it does the opportunity for repeated re­examination of the original court judgment through
 ineffectiveness claims and post-conviction processes, has the
 potential for doing serious harm to children whose lives have by
 definition already been very difficult”). We note that Mother,
 in her application, also urged this court to “apply or formulate
 a family court standard of the correct remedy for ‘ineffective
 assistance of counsel.’” 
In the criminal context, the United States Supreme
 
Court has further refined the test for ineffective assistance of
 counsel, where counsel has failed to file a notice of appeal. 
Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000). In Flores-Ortega, the
 defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, and was
 sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison. Id. at 473-74. 
Flores-Ortega was informed by the trial judge that he could file
 an appeal within 60 days following sentencing, and that counsel
 would be appointed to represent him on appeal if he was indigent. 
Id. at 474. However, Flores-Ortega’s appointed counsel failed to
 file a notice of appeal, and Flores-Ortega himself was unable to
 communicate with counsel during the first 90 days following
 sentencing. Id. After Flores-Ortega’s pro se attempt to file a
 
belated notice of appeal was rejected, he filed a federal habeas
 petition alleging that his counsel’s failure to file a notice of
 
-45­ 
Id. at 480.
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
appeal on his behalf constituted constitutionally ineffective
 
assistance of counsel. Id. The district court adopted the
 
Magistrate Judge’s findings and recommendations and denied
 Flores-Ortega’s petition. Id. at 475. Flores-Ortega appealed. 
Id. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
 
reversed, and certiorari was granted. Id. at 475-76. 
The United States Supreme Court held that the
 
Strickland test applies to claims of ineffective assistance of
 counsel arising out of counsel’s failure to file a notice of
 appeal. Id. at 476-77. The Court then addressed the
 
circumstances under which the failure to file a notice of appeal
 would be considered to fall “below an objective standard of
 reasonableness.” Id. at 476-78 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at
 
688). The Court emphasized that “a lawyer who disregards
 specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of
 appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.” 
Id. at 477. However, the Court declined to establish a bright-
line rule deeming it per se deficient to fail to “file a notice
 of appeal unless the defendant specifically instructs otherwise.” 
Id. at 478. Rather, the Court held that:
 
counsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult
with the defendant about an appeal when there is
reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant
would want to appeal (for example, because there are
nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2) that this
particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to
counsel that he was interested in appealing. 
With regard to the prejudice prong, the Court concluded
 
-46­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the “denial of the entire judicial proceeding itself,” which
 
resulted from counsel’s failure to file a notice of appeal, was
 presumptively prejudicial. Id. at 483. However, the Court held
 
that the Strickland standard required that “counsel’s deficient
 performance must actually cause the forfeiture of the defendant’s
 appeal.” Id. at 484. The Court further held that:
 
[i]f the defendant cannot demonstrate that, but for
counsel’s deficient performance, he would have
appealed, counsel’s deficient performance has not
deprived him of anything, and he is not entitled to
relief.
 
Id. 
The Court further noted that:
 
As with all applications of the Strickland test, the
question of whether a given defendant has made the
requisite showing will turn on the facts of a
particular case. Nonetheless, evidence that there
were nonfrivolous grounds for appeal or that the
defendant in question promptly expressed a desire to
appeal will often be highly relevant in making this
determination.
 
Id. at 485 (citation omitted).
 
Applying this analysis to the facts of Flores-Ortega’s
 
case, the Court concluded that “the Magistrate Judge’s findings
 
do not provide us with sufficient information to determine
 whether [defense counsel] rendered constitutionally inadequate
 assistance.” Id. at 487. The Court further noted:
 
Assuming, arguendo, that there was a duty to consult
in this case, it is impossible to determine whether
that duty was satisfied without knowing whether
[defense counsel] advised [Flores-Ortega] about the
advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal and
made a reasonable effort to discover his wishes. 
Based on the record before us, we are unable to
determine whether [defense counsel] had a duty to
consult with [Flores-Ortega] (either because there
were potential grounds for appeal or because [Flores-
Ortega] expressed interest in appealing), whether she
 
-47­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
satisfied her obligations, and, if she did not,
whether [Flores-Ortega] was prejudiced thereby.
 
Id. at 487.
 
In In re A.J., 143 P.3d 1143 (Colo. Ct. App. 2006), the
 
Colorado Court of Appeals considered the effect of the holding in
 
Flores-Ortega on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in
 a termination of parental rights case, in the context of
 determining whether to accept a late-filed notice of appeal. The
 mother timely communicated her decision to appeal the termination
 order to her counsel, who filed an untimely notice of appeal of
 the family court’s termination order. Id. at 1149. The court
 
noted that the mother filed her notice of appeal just over six
 weeks after the family court entered its termination order,
 “within nine months after the child’s removal from the home,
 [and] three months before the [expedited permanency planning
 (EPP)] deadline for permanent placement of the child.” Id. The
 
court noted that the statutory framework for EPP cases requires
 that the child “be placed in a permanent home within twelve
 months of his [or her] initial placement out of the home[,]” and
 characterized the length of delay in this case as “relatively
 short.” Id. 
The court concluded that “counsel’s failure to file a
 
timely notice of appeal after mother told him she wanted to
 appeal the termination order amounts to ineffective assistance of
 counsel.” Id. However, under Colorado law, the mother was also
 
required to demonstrate good cause warranting reinstatement of
 
-48­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the right to appeal. Id. Because the mother had advised her
 
counsel that she wished to appeal, the court concluded that she
 
did not contribute to the delay in filing the appeal and, under
 the specific circumstances of the case, there was good cause for
 extending the appeal deadline. Id. at 1150. However, the court
 
noted that:
 
if any one of the circumstances in this case were
different, we may have reached a different result. In
 particular, we might have been inclined to dismiss the
appeal if the untimely filing of the notice of appeal
were attributable to mother’s carelessness or
 inaction, or if the delay had been longer or exceeded
the EPP deadline for permanent placement of the child.
 
Id.
 
Finally, some federal courts have declined to extend
 
the holding in Flores-Ortega to other civil contexts in which due
 
process requires the effective assistance of counsel. In
 Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2001), the Court of
 Appeals for the First Circuit noted that counsel’s incompetence
 during immigration proceedings, which are civil in nature, “may
 make the proceeding fundamentally unfair and give rise to a Fifth
 Amendment due process objection.” Id. at 55 (emphasis in
 
original). Hernandez’s counsel had filed a timely notice of
 appeal of Hernandez’s deportation order with the Board of
 Immigration Appeals (Board) but failed to brief the issues on
 appeal, resulting in the appeal being dismissed. Id. at 52-53. 
Hernandez had the option to appeal the Board’s decision, but his
 counsel failed to do so. Id. at 53. Almost four years later,
 
Hernandez was issued a letter directing him to appear for
 
-49­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
deportation, and Hernandez then filed a petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus with the district court and a motion to reopen his
 case with the Board, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. 
Id. at 53. 
The First Circuit noted that:
 
Were this a criminal case, counsel’s failure to comply
with a defendant’s request to appeal would be treated
as prejudice per se. But we are unwilling, unless
directed to do so, to incorporate into civil
deportation proceedings the whole apparatus of Sixth
Amendment precedent. Our concern in the immigration
context is not with the Sixth Amendment but with
 preserving a fair opportunity to have a waiver
considered; it does not include an opportunity to tie
up deportation proceedings in knots through collateral
attacks on defects that would not plausibly have
altered the result.
 
Id. at 57 (citations omitted; emphasis added). 
Moreover, the First Circuit noted that Hernandez “had
 
some duty--as a condition of a successful due process claim--to
 
monitor his lawyer’s actions and assure that his appeal was being
 pursued[,]” but did not do so. Id. Accordingly, the First
 
Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of Hernandez’s
 habeas petition. Id.
 
Applying these principles to Mother’s case, we hold
 
that the right to counsel in termination of parental rights
 cases, where applicable, includes the right to effective counsel.
 
We further hold that the proper inquiry when a claim of
 
ineffectiveness of counsel is raised in a termination of parental
 rights case is whether the proceedings were fundamentally unfair
 as a result of counsel’s incompetence. Cf. Geist, 796 P.2d at
 
-50­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1203 (“Mother must show, not only that her trial counsel was
 
inadequate, but also that any inadequacy prejudiced her cause to
 the extent that she was denied a fair trial and, therefore, that
 the justice of the [trial] court’s decision is called into
 serious question.”); Baker, 810 N.E.2d at 1041 (“Where parents
 whose rights were terminated upon trial claim on appeal that
 their lawyer underperformed, we deem the focus of the inquiry to
 be whether it appears that the parents received a fundamentally
 fair trial whose facts demonstrate an accurate determination.”);
 Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 57 (“Our concern in the immigration
 context is not with the Sixth Amendment but with preserving a
 fair opportunity to have a waiver claim considered”). The movant
 bears the burden of establishing “not only that her trial counsel
 was inadequate, but also that any inadequacy prejudiced her cause
 to the extent that she was denied a fair trial and, therefore,
 that the justice of the [trial] court’s decision is called into
 serious question.” Id. at 1204. Although principles developed
 
in assessing ineffective assistance of counsel claims in the
 criminal context may be instructive, they are not dispositive in
 the termination of parental rights context. Cf. Hernandez, 238
 
F.3d at 57 (noting that “Sixth Amendment precedent is worth
 consulting where counsel’s performance is attacked in a
 deportation proceeding, but it is not binding and should not be
 blindly imported wholesale”).
 
We adopt a fundamental fairness test, rather than
 
-51­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
importing criminal law concepts directly, for several reasons. 
First, the constitutional bases of the respective rights to counsel are different. The right to counsel in the criminal context is based on the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 14 of the Hawai
'i 
Constitution. In contrast, the right to counsel in termination of parental rights proceedings is based on due process. Cf. 
Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 57; Anthony C. Musto, Potato, Potahto: Whether Ineffective Assistance or Due Process, An Effective Rule is Overdue in Termination of Parental Rights Cases in Florida, 21 St. Thomas L. Rev. 231, 243 (2009) (“It seems logical that if the right to counsel in a particular situation arises from due process, the issue of whether some act or omission of counsel rendered a proceeding unfair should be deemed to be one of due process.”); see also In re Doe, 99 Hawai
'i 522, 534, 57 P.3d 447, 
459 (2002) (analyzing denial of an interpreter in a termination of parental rights proceeding under procedural due process principles). 
Second, there are substantial differences in the
 
purposes of criminal as opposed to termination of parental rights
 proceedings. See Baker, 810 N.E.2d at 1039 (noting that “[t]he
 
resolution of a civil juvenile proceeding focuses on the best
 interests of the child, not on guilt or innocence as in a
 criminal proceeding”); Geist, 796 P.2d at 1202 (“There are
 substantial differences between adult criminal cases and juvenile
 
-52­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court proceedings involving children and their parents. Courts
 
have long recognized that the substantive standards and
 procedural rules governing criminal cases are not necessarily
 applicable or even desirable in juvenile court proceedings.”). 
Consistent with that understanding, some of the protections that
 exist for adult criminal defendants have not been fully imported
 into the parental rights context. Geist, 796 P.2d at 1202
 
(noting that, unlike in criminal cases, under Lassiter, the right
 to counsel in termination of parental rights cases is determined
 on a case-by-case basis and that, under Santosky v. Kramer, 455
 U.S. 745, 768-69 (1982), the burden of proof in termination cases
 is clear and convincing evidence rather than proof beyond a
 reasonable doubt). Conversely, “the odds of an accurate
 determination in a termination case are enhanced by the fact of
 judicial involvement that is much more intensive than it is [in]
 the usual criminal case.” Baker, 810 N.E.2d at 1041 (noting that
 
the judge “is not limited to [the parties’] presentations, and
 . . . may require more than they present and direct further
 investigation, evaluations or expert testimony to assure him [or
 her] that the interests of the child and the respective parties
 are properly represented.” (quoting In re Adoption of T.M.F., 573
 A.2d 1035, 1042-43 (1990)). 
Third, the interests implicated by criminal and
 
termination of parental rights cases are substantially different. 
Most notably, termination of parental rights proceedings
 
-53­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
implicate the interests of the child in having a prompt and
 
permanent resolution of his or her custody status–-a factor that
 is absent in the criminal context.
23 As the Supreme Court of
 
Indiana noted in Baker:
 
In the context of termination cases, extended
litigation imposes that burden on the most vulnerable
people whom the system and such cases seek to protect:
the children. As Justice Powell wrote, “There is
little that can be as detrimental to a child’s sound
 development as uncertainty over whether he is to
remain in his current ‘home,’ under the care of his
parents or foster parents, especially when such
uncertainty is prolonged.” Lehman, 458 U.S. at 513­
14, 102 S.Ct. 3231. Justice Joette Katz made a
 similar observation when Connecticut’s high court
decided not to permit state habeas as a vehicle for
collateral attacks on judgments of termination:
“[T]here exists, as the trial court noted in this
case, a ‘frightening possibility that a habeas
petition will negate the permanent placement of a
child whose status had presumably been in limbo for
several years.’ Consequently, the state’s interest as
paren patriae militates against allowing the writ.”
In re Jonathan M., 255 Conn. 208, 764 A.2d 739, 753
(2001) (footnote omitted).
 
To permit the children to travel from one home
to another while termination proceedings span across
the years is “incongruous and contrary to the federal
and state policy of minimizing the ‘foster care drift’
that has doomed millions of children to interim,
multiple or otherwise impermanent placement.” In re
 
Adoption of A.M.B., 812 A.2d 659, 667 (Pa.Super.Ct.
2002). Due to the immeasurable damage a child may
suffer amidst the uncertainty that comes with such
collateral attacks, it is in the child’s best interest
and overall well being to limit the potential for
years of litigation and instability. “It is
 undisputed that children require secure, stable, long-
term, continuous relationships with their parents or
foster parents. There is little that can be as
 detrimental to a child’s sound development as
uncertainty.” Lehman, 458 U.S. at 513, 102 S.Ct.
 
3231.
 
Id. at 1040; see Geist, 796 P.2d at 1201 (observing that in
 
23
 We therefore respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion
that the best interests of the child can only be considered “after Petitioner
is given the opportunity to present her side of the case.” Dissenting Opinion
at 81 (emphasis added).
 
-54­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
termination proceedings, “[w]hether or not the eventual result is
 
termination, protracted litigation extends uncertainty in the
 child[ren]’s life”); Musto, 21 Saint Thomas L. Rev. at 243-44
 (“It also appears from a policy perspective that due process is a
 more fitting framework than ineffective assistance for
 termination cases. . . . It [] broadens the appropriate
 considerations in a manner that can better focus courts on the
 best interest of the child[ren] involved, rather than merely the
 impact on the parent of counsel’s acts or omissions”). 
Applying these principles here, we decline to adopt the
 
rule adopted in Flores-Ortega, under which prejudice is presumed
 when defense counsel fails to comply with a defendant’s request
 to file an appeal in a criminal case.
24 Rather, the failure of
 
appellate counsel to file an appeal in a termination of parental
 rights case must be viewed in the broader context of whether the
 family court proceeding was fundamentally unfair. The merit (or
 lack thereof) of the issues that a party intends to raise on
 appeal is a relevant consideration in making that determination. 
Cf. Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 57 (court declines to apply Flores-
Ortega to an immigration proceeding, and notes that a party who
 claims ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in that
 
24
 However, we note that, even if the holding in Flores-Ortega were
 
to apply in termination of parental rights cases, counsel’s failure to file a
notice of appeal will only be considered per se ineffective where the party
has specifically instructed his or her counsel to file a notice of appeal.
528 U.S. at 477. Although there are references in the record here which
indirectly support an inference that Mother conveyed her desire to appeal to
Yonemori, there is nothing in the record to directly confirm that she did so. 
-55­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
context must show more than “defects that would not plausibly
 
have altered the result.”).
 
D.	 The family court did not abuse its discretion in denying
Mother’s Rule 60(b)(6) motion
 
1.	 Mother failed to establish that her pre-termination
counsel was ineffective
 
In her application, Mother appears to request a new
 
trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel in the
 
four-year period leading up to the family court’s March 11, 2005
 Termination Order. In her February 6, 2007 motion from which
 this appeal is taken, Mother alleged that she was denied her due
 process rights by:
 
the Order Denying Mother’s Motion to Reconsider Denial
of Oral Motion to Continue Trial; and Exclusion of
Exhibits Filed December 23, 2004, filed on March 7,
2005, and/or, the Order Denying Mother’s Motion to
Reinstate Visitation Filed January 11, 2005, filed on
March 7, 2005, and/or, at the time of entry of the
Court’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
filed on March 11, 2005.
 
(Emphasis in original). 
However, Mother’s February 6, 2007 motion failed to
 
identify any specific error or omission on the part of counsel
 
during the specified proceedings. Similarly, Mother has failed
 to point to any alleged errors apparent in the record. Moreover,
 Mother has not provided this court with transcripts from the pre-
termination period or the permanent plan hearing to support her
 contention that Mother’s counsel was ineffective, nor has she
 provided transcripts of the family court’s hearing on her
 February 6, 2007 motion. Contrary to Mother’s assertion that her
 
-56­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
pre-termination counsel was ineffective, the family court
 
expressly noted in its March 7, 2005 written order denying
 Mother’s July 12, 2004 oral motion for a new attorney that “[t]he
 court has seen nothing to indicate Ms. Iopa [has] not been
 effective in her representation and notes Ms. Iopa has worked
 hard to assist [Mother].” 
This court has held that “[t]he burden is upon 
appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.” Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (quoting Union Building 
Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 
P.2d 82, 87 (1984)) (brackets omitted); Lepere v. United Pub. Workers, Local 646, 77 Hawai
'i 471, 474, 887 P.2d 1029, 1032 
(1995) (“Lepere, as appellant, had a duty to include the relevant transcripts of proceedings as a part of the record on appeal.”) (footnote omitted); see Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
10(b)(1)(A) (“When an appellant desires to raise any point on appeal that requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the court . . . appealed from, the appellant shall file . . . a request or requests to prepare a reporter’s transcript of such parts of the proceedings as the appellant deems necessary that are not already on file.”). Given the family court’s findings in the record, and absent a transcript of the proceedings or other indications in the record to suggest otherwise, the record does 
-57­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
-58-not establish that Mother’s pre-termination counsel was
ineffective.  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its
discretion in denying Mother’s motion with respect to the pre-
termination proceedings.  
2. The family court did not abuse its discretion in
denying Mother’s motion with regard to the post-
termination proceedings
The record establishes that Mother did not receive
effective assistance of counsel with regard to her appeal. 
However, as we discuss below, Mother failed to establish that the
family court proceedings were fundamentally unfair.  Moreover,
there was a nearly two-year delay between the March 11, 2005
order terminating custody, and Mother’s filing of the Rule
60(b)(6) motion that is at issue here.  A delay of that magnitude
in determining permanent custodial status has a substantial
negative impact on the interests of the child, which is a
significant factor weighing against the granting of Rule 60(b)(6)
relief.  As we set forth below, Mother failed to demonstrate her
entitlement to relief in the family court, and has failed on
appeal to establish that the family court abused its discretion
in denying the motion.
RGB was initially placed in temporary foster custody in
2001.  She was later returned to Mother under family supervision,
and then placed in foster custody in April, 2002.  At the time of
that placement, she was 2 years and 9 months old.  She
subsequently remained in the care of the same foster family***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
through the permanent plan hearing. 
There are several reports in the record that discuss
 
RGB’s status after that hearing. On August 3, 2005, DHS filed a
 
report to the family court in which it noted:
 
[RGB] has lived with her foster parents for three
years and five months and is well-adjusted and has
adapted to her environment. . . . 
[RGB] is happy and doing well in her current
placement. It would be in the best interest of [RGB]
if the adoption process were to be completed sooner
rather than later. However, Deputy Attorney General,
Howard Shiroma, reports that Mother is appealing the
[Termination Order]. . . . Thus, Mother’s appeal to
the [c]ourt may delay the adoption process, negatively
impacting the well-being of [RGB].
 
On August 4, 2005, RGB’s guardian ad litem filed a
 
report stating:
 
With regard to the permanency goal of adoption
of he [sic] child . . . , I have spoken to Carrie
Yonemori, the attorney appointed to represent Mother
in her appeal of the [c]ourt’s permanency order, and
she has related that the necessary paperwork
pertaining to such appeal should be submitted to the
Supreme Court shortly. Although it is certainly not
in the child’s best interest, I would suppose that we
would be unable to proceed with any adoption until
such appeal is resolved.
 
On January 17, 2006, DHS filed a report to the family
 
court in which it noted that RGB “continues to do very well in
 
the care of foster parents, . . . whom she has resided with for
 nearly four years.” DHS further noted that:
 
[RGB’s foster parents] want to adopt [RGB] and have
been ready to proceed with the adoption process ever
since biological mother’s parental rights were
terminated in March 2005. However, biological
Mother’s pending appeal to the court . . . has
prevented the DHS and [RGB’s foster parents] from
proceeding with the adoption. Hence, [foster parents]
and [RGB] and the entire family are disappointed. Per
 [foster mother], [RGB] continually wonders and asks
“when will she be adopted”.
 
-59­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On May 23, 2006, DHS filed a report to the family
 
court, in which it noted that “[RGB] continue[d] in her
 
placement” where she “ha[d] been [] since April 4, 2002[,]” that
 she “wants to remain there forever because she loves her foster
 parents whom she refers to as ‘mom’ and ‘dad[,]’” and that “she
 wants to be adopted as soon as possible[.]” 
On June 2, 2006, RGB’s guardian ad litem filed a report
 
to the family court, stating that, “[i]n the past, foster parents
 had reported [RGB] making reference to her mother, . . . .
 However, for some time now, the only references made by [RGB] of
 her mother are in the context of fantasized incidents.”
25
 
As noted in section C, supra, the negative effect on
 
children of delays and uncertainty in determining permanent
 custodial arrangements has been well documented. See, e.g.,
 
Baker, 810 N.E.2d at 1039-41. The record here clearly
 establishes such negative impacts on RGB. She has lived with
 uncertainty about the status of her family for most of her life,
 and wants that uncertainty to end. 
At the time the family court issued its Termination
 
Order, RGB had been in foster custody for nearly three years. 
See HRS § 587-72(e) (Supp. 2004 & Supp. 2005) (requiring DHS,
 with limited exception, to file a motion to set a permanent plan
 
25
 The June 2, 2006 report is the last report in the record before
the family court’s September 28, 2006 hearing, after which it issued its
November 9, 2006 written order prohibiting Mother from having access to the
family court record going forward. 
-60­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
hearing if “the child has been residing outside of the family
 
home for an aggregate of fifteen out of the most recent twenty-
two months[.]”). The effect of the additional delay that would
 have been caused by granting the Rule 60(b)(6) motion was a
 factor that weighed substantially in favor of denying the motion. 
Cf. A.J., 143 P.3d at 1149-50 (although court allowed the filing
 of an untimely direct appeal in a termination of parental rights
 case, it noted that only nine months had elapsed since the child
 was first removed from the home and that the outcome could have
 been different “if the delay had been longer or exceeded the EPP
 deadline for permanent placement of the child”). Mother failed
 to establish an entitlement to relief sufficient to overcome that
 factor. 
First, Mother has not identified, either in her Rule
 
60(b)(6) motion, her brief to the ICA, her application for
 certiorari, or oral argument in this court, what errors occurred
 in the permanent plan hearing that she would have challenged had
 Yonemori timely appealed on her behalf. In view of her failure
 to identify any potentially meritorious issues that could have
 been raised but for Yonemori’s failure to timely appeal, the
 record does not establish that the proceedings were fundamentally
 unfair. Cf. Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 57 (collateral attacks in
 
immigration proceedings based on ineffective assistance of
 counsel should not be permitted based “on defects that would not
 plausibly have altered the result”). 
-61­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Second, Mother’s Rule 60(b)(6) motion did not
 
adequately establish that she did not play a role in contributing
 
to the delay in bringing the motion. See Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4
 
Haw. App. 286, 290, 666 P.2d 171, 174-75 (1983) (noting that
 relief under Rule 60(b)(6) “calls for diligence by the moving
 party”); cf. Hernandez, 238 F.3d at 57 (observing that “it would
 seem that Hernandez had some duty–-as a condition of a successful
 due process claim–-to monitor his lawyer’s actions and assure
 that his appeal was being pursued”); A.J., 143 P.3d at 1150
 (allowing the filing of an untimely direct appeal in a
 termination of parental rights case, but noting that the result
 could have been different “if the untimely filing of the notice
 of appeal were attributable to mother’s carelessness or
 inaction”). Yonemori’s representation of Mother was deficient,
 as Yonemori conceded in her filings in the family court, and it
 is Yonemori who appears to bear primary responsibility for most
 of the delay that occurred after the family court appointed her
 to represent Mother. However, the record does not explain why
 Mother waited until March 10, 2006 before bringing Yonemori’s
 inaction to the attention of the family court. 
Although Mother has a mental health condition,
 
nevertheless the record shows that Mother was of “above-average”
 intelligence, and that she did not hesitate to bring perceived
 defects in her counsels’ performance to the attention of the
 family court. There may be good explanations for why Mother did
 
-62­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
not act sooner with regard to Yonemori’s failure to timely file
 
the appeal; however, the record does not reflect them.26 In
 
seeking the extraordinary relief of setting aside the March 11,
 2005 Termination Order nearly two years after it was entered, the
 burden was on Mother to establish that she was not responsible
 for the delay. See Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290, 666 P.2d at 174
 
(noting that “relief [under Rule 60(b)(6)] is extraordinary and
 the movant must show that . . . the motion is made within a
 reasonable time”). 
Finally, we note that Mother failed to include in the 
appellate record any transcripts of proceedings relevant to determining whether the family court abused its discretion. As noted in section III(D)(1), supra, appellants have the burden of including in the record all transcripts relevant to their points of error. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558 (“The 
burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.”) (brackets and citations omitted). 
26 As discussed supra, “diligence by the moving party” is a threshold
 
requirement of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion. Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290-91, 666
 
P.2d at 174-75. We therefore require a showing by the movant of “exceptional
circumstances” to mitigate any delay. Id. at 291, 666 P.2d at 175. We
 
respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion that, by doing so, we have
“[laid] the fault for the failure to file a timely motion for reconsideration
. . . at the feet of Petitioner[.]” Dissenting Opinion at 91. To the
 contrary, we express no view on the diligence or lack thereof of Mother, but
rather observe that Mother has failed to provide any information regarding her
own understanding of what was transpiring between the issuance of the
Termination Order on March 11, 2005 and her filing of her pro se Motion for
Relief from Judgment on March 10, 2006. 
-63­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Although the proceedings in this case have lasted many
 
years and included a six-day permanent plan hearing, Mother did
 
not include any transcripts as part of the record on appeal. 
Mother did not include in the record any transcripts from the
 permanent plan hearing that might explain the circumstances
 surrounding the court’s March 11, 2005 order discharging Iopa. 
Mother also did not include in the record any transcripts from
 the hearings held during the period between the Termination Order
 and the hearing on Mother’s February 6, 2007 Rule 60(b)(6)
 motion. For example, in its written order following a hearing on
 April 6, 2006, the family court noted that Mother waived any
 conflict of interest Yonemori had in continuing to represent
 Mother; presumably, that hearing included some discussion of the
 consequences of the waiver and/or about what actions were
 expected to be taken subsequent to the hearing. Moreover, Mother
 did not include in the record any transcripts from the
 September 28, 2006 hearing on Mother’s pro se Rule 60 motion,
 Yonemori’s Rule 60 motion, and Yonemori’s motion to withdraw. 
Most notably, Mother did not include in the record a
 
transcript of the April 24, 2007 hearing on Mother’s February 6,
 2007 Rule 60(b)(6) motion, which is the subject of this appeal. 
Thus, we do not know what, if anything, was said concerning the
 reasons for the delays that occurred after the Termination Order
 was issued, or any oral comments that might have been made by the
 court in explaining its ruling. The burden was on Mother to
 
-64­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
include in the record an adequate transcript of the proceeding 
that gave rise to this appeal. See Bettencourt, 80 Hawai 'i at 
230, 909 P.2d at 558. Mother’s failure to provide a transcript is a substantial omission. State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i 333, 334, 
3 P.3d 499, 500 (“Without the . . . transcript, the Intermediate Court of Appeals did not, and this court does not, have a basis upon which to review the point of error raised in the present appeal.”). 
For all these reasons, Mother has failed to establish
 
that the family court abused its discretion in denying her Rule
 60(b)(6) motion. 
E.	 The family court did not abuse its discretion in limiting
Mother’s access to post-termination records
 
As noted above, the family court held a hearing on
 
September 28, 2006, following which it issued its November 9,
 
2006 written order, limiting Mother’s access to the court records
 in this case as follows:
 
Mother[‘s] . . . parental rights have been terminated
and due to this status and the possibility of
dissemination of these confidential records, the court
finds that future court records are not currently
available to Mother . . . ; provided however that
court records will be made available for any appellate
review of this decision.
 
In her February 6, 2007 motion, Mother moved for, inter
 
alia, “release of all evidence or files in case,” and alleged
 
that the family court’s November 9, 2006 limitation on her access
 to the court records “[was] a direct violation of the right to
 due process[.]” 
-65­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On May 8, 2007, the family court denied Mother’s motion
 
and all relief therein requested, and Mother appealed. Mother’s
 
October 30, 2007 Opening Brief to the ICA again alleged that
 “when the trial court refused to allow [Mother] to review
 ‘confidential’ records and files, as stated in the Motion
 appealed from, this was yet another example of a deprivation of
 [Mother’s] due process rights to a fair trial.” The ICA
 concluded that the family court “did not err in limiting Mother’s
 access to the post-November 6, 2006 confidential record in this
 case.” In re RGB, 2009 WL 953392 at *3. 
Finally, in her application for a writ of certiorari,
 
Mother argued that “[a]s a parent’s right to file an array of 60b
 [sic] motions continue for up to one year and in some cases
 beyond, a[n] unfettered right to review such records during the
 one year period at least should freely be given to Mother.” 
Mother further argued that “a new trial must be granted as the
 only appropriate remedy.”
27
 
Although not entirely clear, Mother’s application
 
therefore appears to challenge the family court’s November 9,
 2006 order limiting her prospective access to the court records
 in this case. Accordingly, we construe Mother’s February 6, 2007
 motion as a request to vacate or reconsider the family court’s
 
27
 We note that Mother failed to include with her application a
statement of the facts material to our consideration of the question presented
concerning her access to records as required by HRAP Rule 40(d)(3), and her
argument may accordingly be disregarded. Nevertheless, we address the merits
of Mother’s argument.
 
-66­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
November 9, 2006 written order limiting her prospective access to
 
the court records. 
The family court’s November 9, 2006 order limiting
 
Mother’s access to the court records draws support from its
 March 11, 2005 order terminating Mother’s parental rights. Upon
 the termination of parental rights, HRS § 587-73(b)(4) (1993 &
 Supp. 2005 & 2006)
28
 allows the family court to limit or restrict
the participation of unnecessary parties in subsequent
 proceedings as follows:
 
the court shall order . . . [t]hat such further orders
as the court deems to be in the best interests of the
 child, including, but not limited to, restricting or
excluding unnecessary parties from participating in
adoption or other subsequent proceedings, be
entered[.]
 
HRS § 587-73(b)(4). 
Consistent with that power, the family court, in its
 
Termination Order, found that “it is in [RGB’s] best interests
 
that the participation of Mother and Father in subsequent
 hearings be limited or restricted to appearances on any motions
 for relief from this decision and order or any motions necessary
 to pursue an appeal.” The family court’s November 9, 2006 order
 limiting Mother’s access to the court records stems from the
 termination of Mother’s parental rights, and the family court’s
 finding that limitations on Mother’s participation in subsequent
 proceedings concerning RGB would be in RGB’s best interest. This
 
28
 HRS § 587-73(b)(4) now appears as HRS § 587-73(b)(1)(D) (Supp.
2008).
 
-67­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
limitation is consistent with the powers afforded the family
 
court under HRS § 587-73(b)(4). 
In addition, as noted by the ICA, Mother has failed to
 
identify “any documents or category of documents that she
 reasonably requested access to or why she need[ed] full access,” 
In re RGB, 2009 WL 953392 at *3. and has not identified any
 relevance of the post-November 9, 2006 record to her appeal. 
Moreover, aside from acknowledging the length of time that has
 passed since the family court’s March 11, 2005 Termination Order,
 we do not rely on the post-November 9, 2006 record in reaching our
 holding, and Mother therefore had access to all court records that
 were relevant to her appeal. 
Accordingly, we hold that the family court did not abuse
 
its discretion in issuing its November 9, 2006 order limiting
 Mother’s prospective access to the court records or in denying
 Mother’s February 6, 2007 motion insofar as it sought to have the
 court reconsider or vacate its earlier ruling.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ICA’s May 21,
 
2009 judgment.
