 On May 2, 2011, Respondent and Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee State 
of Hawai 'i (Respondent) filed a Motion for Reconsideration in response to this
court’s April 15, 2011 published opinion, State v. Torres , No. SCWC-28583,

defendant in a Hawai' i state court, and seeks to admit evidence 
obtained in another jurisdiction, the court must give due 
consideration to the Hawai' i Constitution and applicable case 
law, as indicated herein, when assessing whether such evidence is admissible against the defendant. Both Respondent and Petitioner and Respondent/Defendant-Appellant Jenaro Torres (Petitioner) applied for writs of certiorari to review the January 7, 2010

judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)  filed
pursuant to its December 15, 2009 published opinion vacating the
 May 29, 2007 judgment of conviction filed by the circuit court of
 the first circuit (the court).
3 We accepted Petitioner’s
 
Application for writ of certiorari (Petitioner’s Application or
 Application) to correct the ICA’s analysis with regard to the
 admissibility of evidence obtained by federal officers in a state
 court prosecution. 
In accordance with the opinion set forth herein, we 
uphold that portion of the ICA’s opinion affirming the legality of the searches of Petitioner’s vehicle under federal law. However, we correct the opinion of the ICA insofar as it failed to additionally consider whether the searches of Petitioner’s vehicle also comported with the Hawai' i Constitution and 
applicable case law. We affirm the opinion of the ICA in all

Constitution. 
I.
 
The following relevant facts, some verbatim, are from
 
the ICA opinion and the record.
 
A.
 
Ruben Gallegos (Gallegos) worked as a cashier at the 
Pearl Harbor Naval Base (PHNB) Navy Exchange. State v. Torres, 
122 Hawai' i 2, 6, 222 P.3d 409, 413 (App. 2009). On May 1, 1992, 
Gallegos was assigned to cash paychecks at a satellite cashier’s cage (cashier cage). Id. at 7, 222 P.3d at 414. Prior to 
reporting to the cashier cage, Gallegos received $80,000 in cash. Id. Shortly after Gallegos had been escorted to the cashier 
cage, Petitioner, who was a police officer at PHNB, arrived at the cashier cage in his police uniform, although Petitioner was not scheduled to work on that day. A witness saw Gallegos exit the cashier cage carrying the canvas cash bag and saw the two men walk toward the parking area. Id. Military authorities were 
subsequently notified that Gallegos was not at his post and “an all points bulletin was issued to detain and arrest [Petitioner] and Gallegos[.]” Id. at 8, 222 P.3d at 415. 
Later that day, PHNB police officer Napoleon Aguilar
 
(Officer Aguilar) saw Petitioner in a line of cars waiting to
 enter PHNB. Id. Officer Aguilar waived Petitioner through, but,
 
3
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
once through, motioned for him to stop. Id. When Petitioner
 
rolled down his window to shake Officer Aguilar’s hand, Officer
 
Aguilar reached into Petitioner’s vehicle and turned off the
 ignition. Id. A struggle ensued but Petitioner eventually
 
complied with Officer Aguilar’s orders, exited the vehicle, and
 was arrested. Id. Because Petitioner’s vehicle was blocking
 
traffic, PHNB Police Sergeant James Rozkiewicz (Sergeant
 Rozkiewicz) moved it to a nearby parking lot. Id. Pursuant to
 
base procedures for securing an unattended vehicle, Sergeant
 Rozkiewicz checked the vehicle and the trunk for hazardous or
 flammable substances. Id. When Sergeant Rozkiewicz attempted to
 
lock the glove compartment, the compartment door fell open,
 revealing a .38 caliber revolver and a scanner. Id. 
Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Special
 
Agent Ty Torco (Agent Torco) prepared an affidavit in support of
 a Command Authorization for Search and Seizure (Command
 Authorization), seeking authorization to search Petitioner’s
 vehicle. Id. at 16, 222 P.3d at 423. The affidavit detailed the
 
information Agent Torco had learned regarding Petitioner’s
 alleged involvement in the theft of $80,000 from the Navy
 Exchange and also included the observations made by Sergeant
 Rozkiewicz during his inspection and securing of Petitioner’s
 vehicle. Id. The Command Authorization was signed by E.A.
 
Warner, Commander of PHNB. Id. 
4
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A subsequent search of Petitioner’s vehicle by NCIS and
 
FBI agents revealed a brown bag in the trunk, which NCIS agents
 
recognized as the type of bag used by the Navy Exchange to
 transport cash. Id. at 8, 222 P.3d at 415. The bag contained
 
$77,971.82 in cash, along with other items, including a wallet in
 which Gallegos’s driver’s license, Navy Exchange identification
 card, bank card, temporary pass to Pearl Harbor, and other papers
 were found. Id. NCIS agents also recovered a .38 caliber
 
revolver registered to Petitioner, a stun gun, and a scanner in
 the glove compartment. Id. NCIS agent Robert Robbins (Agent
 
Robbins) testified at Petitioner’s trial that upon examination of
 the revolver obtained from Petitioner’s vehicle, he discovered
 that there were two intact bullets and three spent cartridge
 casings in the revolver. Id. Gallegos, who had been reported
 
missing on May 1, 1992, was never seen again. Id.
 
Petitioner was subsequently charged by the federal
 
government with theft and possession of a loaded firearm on a
 public highway without a license. Id. at 6, 222 P.3d at 413. 
Petitioner pled no contest to both charges in federal court and
 was sentenced to concurrent terms of two years of imprisonment. 
Id.
 
Thirteen years after the federal charges were filed, 
Respondent charged Petitioner with murder in the second degree of Gallegos, in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS)

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
§ 707-701.5 (Supp. 1992).4 The indictment further stated that
 
Petitioner was subject to sentencing under HRS § 706-660.1 (Supp.
 
5
1992), for having “a firearm in his possession or threatened the
use or used the firearm while engaged in the commission of [a]
 
felony, whether the firearm was loaded or not, and whether
 operable or not.” 
B.
 
On July 24, 2006, Petitioner filed a Motion to Suppress
 
Evidence No. 2 with the court, seeking to preclude all evidence
 obtained from the search of his automobile, including the
 handgun, stun gun, scanner, victim’s wallet, identification, and
 other papers, nearly seventy-eight thousand dollars, and all
 testimony derived therefrom. 
Petitioner claimed that the 
4	 HRS § 707-701.5, in effect at the time, stated:
 
Murder in the second degree. (1) Except as provided in
section 707-701, a person commits the offense of murder in
the second degree if the person intentionally or knowingly
causes the death of another person.
(2) Murder in the second degree is a felony for which
the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as provided
in section 706-656.
 
5	 HRS § 706-660.1 provided in pertinent part:
 
Sentence of imprisonment for use of a firearm,
semiautomatic firearm, or automatic firearm in a felony.
(1) A person convicted of a felony, where the person had a
firearm in the person’s possession or threatened its use or
used the firearm while engaged in the commission of the
felony, whether the firearm was loaded or not, and whether
operable or not, may in addition to the indeterminate term
of imprisonment provided for the grade of offense be
sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment
without possibility of parole or probation the length of
which shall be as follows:
 
(a)	 For murder in the second degree and attempted
murder in the second degree--up to fifteen
years[.]

searches of his vehicle violated article I, section 7 of the
 
6 7 8
Hawai'i Constitution  and the Fourth  and Fourteenth  Amendments
to the United States Constitution. 
On January 10, 2007, the court issued its Order Denying
 
Petitioner’s Motion to Suppress No. 2 (order). 
In its order, the
 
court made the following findings of fact (findings).
 
1. On May 1, 1992, [Sergeant Rozkiewicz was] on duty
as a base police officer for the [PHNB] and was the acting
desk lieutenant. At the time, he had been employed as a
base police officer for 6 years.
2. On May 1, 1992, [Officer Aguilar] was also working
as a [PHNB] police officer and assigned to guard duty at the
Makalapa Gate of the [PHNB].
3. The [PHNB] is a place where nuclear submarines,
ships and other military transport vehicles are housed.
4. The [PHNB] also has various officers in high
command positions stationed on the base.
5. The [PHNB] had specific regulations for entrance
onto the base as provided for in the Internal Security Act
of 1950.
 
6. Pursuant to the Internal Security Act of 1950, the
[PHNB] posted a clear and visible sign at the entrance gate
which stated: “ Authorized Entry Onto This Installation
Constitutes Consent To Search Of Personnel And The Property
Under Their Control. Internal Security Act of 1950 Section
 
21; 50 U.S.C. 7979.”
 
6 Article I, section 7 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides that 
“[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons . . . againstunreasonable searches, seizures and invasions of privacy shall not beviolated[.]” 
7 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:
 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall
issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be
searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
 
8
 The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states
 
in pertinent part that
 
[n]o state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws.

7. The aforementioned sign was posted at the Makalapa
Gate prior to and on May 1, 1992.
8. Any person who, after reading the sign, decides
not to consent to a search of their [sic] person or property
can turn around and leave without having their [sic] person
or property searched.
9. Additionally, the guard shack where a person would
have to report in order to gain entrance onto the base was
located approximately 50 feet past the sign, thus giving a
person ample opportunity to turn around if the person did
not want to be subjected to a search of their [sic] person
or property.
10. The duties of a base police officer included
enforcement of rules and regulations regarding entry onto
the base as well as enforcement of the laws on the base.
 
11. [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz had receiving [sic] recruit
training and other ongoing or recall training regarding the
rules and regulations on base.
12. Prior to May 1, 1992, [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz was
[Petitioner’s] supervisor. [Petitioner] was also employed
 as a [PHNB] police officer. [Petitioner] had knowledge of
the rules and regulations concerning entry onto the base
because he had received training regarding the Internal
Security Act of 1950 and the regulations concerning
procedures to search persons and property.
13. [Officer] Aguilar and [Petitioner] went to
training together in June 1990 at the Pearl Harbor police
academy and they received training on the Internal Security
Act of 1950.
 
14. On May 1, 1992, prior to 2:30 p.m., [Sergeant]
Rozkiewicz was aware of the theft of $80,000.00 from the
Navy Exchange and that the persons involved was [sic] the
courier [] [Gallegos] and [Petitioner].
15. Sometime after 11:00 a.m., [Officer] Aguilar
received information from [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz and Major
Cruciano that both Gallegos and [Petitioner] were suspects
in the theft of $80,000.00 from the Navy Exchange.
16. Around 2:10 p.m., [Officer] Aguilar saw
[Petitioner]’s vehicle, a silver-gray Chevrolet Celebrity
with the license place “KUNSIL” approach the Makalapa Gate.
 
17. [Petitioner] entered the Makalapa Gate, at which
time [Officer] Aguilar motioned for him to stop the vehicle .
Upon stopping the vehicle, [Officer] Aguilar reached into
the vehicle to turn it off and grabbed the shifting level
which was already in park.
18. [Officer] Aguilar informed [Petitioner] that []
[NCIS] wanted to talk to him about the incident,
[Petitioner] began to struggle to restart the vehicle.
19. [Officer] Aguilar then ordered [Petitioner] out
of the vehicle and issued a felony stop.
20. [Petitioner] complied with [Officer] Aguilar’s
order and stepped out of his vehicle.
21. [Petitioner] was ordered to lie face-down in the
grassy median strip and subsequently handcuffed.
22. When [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz arrived on the scene
around 2:30 p.m., he observed traffic backing up from the
inbound lanes of the Makalapa Gate to Kam Highway.
[Sergeant] Rozkiewicz then made a decision to get traffic
going and moved the vehicle into the base chapel parking lot
that was approximately 31 feet away .

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
23. After moving the vehicle, [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz
followed base police procedures in securing the vehicle,
which required police to check a vehicle that was going to
be left unattended on base , for flammable or volatile
substances such as gasoline, kerosene and explosives.
24. [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz attempted to secure and
lock the glove compartment within [Petitioner’s] vehicle by
using what he thought was the key for the glove compartment.
In doing so, the glove compartment lid fell down, at which
time, [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz observed a scanner and a pistol
in the glove compartment .
25. The viewing of the contents in the glove
compartment by [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz was inadvertent and at
the time, [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz was not searching for
evidence pertaining to the theft of $80,000.00 from the Navy
Exchange or the murder of [] Gallegos. Further, [Sergeant]
Rozkiewicz did not remove or search the glove compartment
after the initial inadvertent viewing of the glove
compartment contents.
26. [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz opened the trunk of [the]
vehicle to make a visual check and ensure there were no
 items within the truck [sic] that would “catch fire” or
 explosives , and during this check, [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz
observed a base police uniform shirt, a pair of dark
trousers, a Sam Browne leather gear and a black plastic bag
that was partially open, exposing a section of brown
leather.
 
27. The visual check of the truck [sic] comported
with the [PHNB] police routine to secure vehicles on base []
to ensure the safety of the personnel and the military
transport vehicles on base, and that the routine check was
not for the purpose of searching for evidence pertaining to
the theft of the $80,000.00 or the murder of [] Gallegos.
28. When [Petitioner] approached the [PHNB] Makalapa
Gate, he intended to gain entry onto the base.
29. Searches conducted pursuant to the Internal
Security Act of 1950 is [sic] necessary for the protection
of military transport vehicles and base personnel.
30. [Petitioner] did not indicate to anyone that he
was revoking his consent to enter onto the base or that he
intended to leave the base . As such, because of
[Petitioner’s] training and knowledge of base procedures, he
consented to a search of his person and vehicle when he
entered the Makalapa Gate.
31. Notwithstanding [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz’
observations, the Naval Criminal Investigators and base
police had sufficient information to obtain a [Command
Authorization] pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of
 
Evidence and therefore, would have inevitably discovered the
evidence in [Petitioner’s] vehicle after obtaining a
[Command Authorization].
32. The [Command Authorization] was properly applied
for and signed by [E].A. [W]arner, Commander of the [PHNB]
pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence .
 
33. A commander qualifies as a neutral and detached
magistrate for the purpose of determining probable cause.
34. There was sufficient probable cause for the
issuance of the [Command Authorization].
35. [Respondent’s] witnesses are credible.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The court made the following conclusions of law
 
(conclusions).
 
1. The Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797)
authorized the search of a [d]efendant’s person and property
under his control.
 
2. There was a government interest in protecting the
[PHNB] and a person with notice of such impending search
into a restricted area with heightened security relinquishes
any reasonable expectation of privacy. United States v.
 
Jenkins , 986 F.2d 76, 79 ([4th Cir.] 1993).
3. Great deference must be shown to the special needs
of the Armed [F]orces at military and naval installations.
United States v. Ellis , 15 F. Supp. 2d 1025 (1998).
4. Searches on closed military bases are exempt from
the usual Fourth Amendment requirements of “probable cause.”
 [Jenkins] , 986 F.2d 76 [].
5. [Petitioner] having knowledge of the Internal
Security Act of 1950, his conduct of driving onto the [PHNB]
and the absence of any evidence to indicate that[Petitioner] revoked his consent demonstrate[] that
[Petitioner] consented to a search of his person andproperty under his control when he entered the MakalapaGate. See State v. Hanson , 97 Haw[ai 'i] 71, 34 P.3d 1 
(2001) [(hereinafter, “ Hanson II ”), affirming State v. 
Hanson, 97 Hawai 'i 77, 34 P.3d 7 (App.) (hereinafter, 
“Hanson I ”)].
6. There was no search within the meaning of
[a]rticle 1, [s]ection 7 of the Hawai 'i State Constitution,
the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution where [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz was following baseprocedures to secure the vehicle, at which time, the glovecompartment door fell open and thereby exposing the pistoland scanner inside the glove compartment.
7. Because the investigating officers had sufficient
probable cause to obtain a search warrant at the time[Petitioner] entered the Makalapa Gate of the [PHNB], theinvestigating officers would have inevitably obtained a
[Command Authorization] pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules 
of Evidence . State v. Lopez , 78 Haw[ai 'i] 433, 896 P.2d 889 
(1995).
8. A [Command Authorization] pursuant to Rule 315,
Military Rules of Evidence complies with the requirements of
 
Chapter 803, [HRS].
9. The [Command Authorization] was signed by E. A.
Warner, a base commander, as authorized by Rule 315,
Military Rules of Evidence , and the base commander qualifies
as a neutral and detached magistrate as required in Chapter
803, [HRS]. United States v. Banks , 539 F.2d 14 (9th Cir.
 
1976).
10. There was sufficient probable cause for issuance
of a [Command Authorization] even if the affidavit was based
in part on illegal [sic] seized evidence, where sufficient

and seizure without reliance on the suppressed evidence.

(Emphases added.) Respondent did not challenge the findings and 
conclusions of the court. Therefore, the court’s findings are binding in the instant appeal and furthermore, any objections to the court’s findings and conclusions are deemed waived. “[P]oints not argued may be deemed waived.” Hawai' i Rules of

Trial commenced on March 6, 2007. At trial, Susan 
Davis (Davis) testified that she became acquainted with Petitioner while Davis and Petitioner were working for a pharmaceutical company. Torres, 122 Hawai' i at 9, 222 P.3d at 
416. According to Davis, Petitioner confided to her that he had
 
been involved in a robbery and insinuated that he had killed one
 of the individuals involved. Id. Davis testified that she had
 
not told anyone because Petitioner had threatened to harm her and
 her family if she did. Id. 
On March 21, 2007, a jury convicted Petitioner of
 
murder in the second degree and found that Petitioner possessed,
 used, or threatened the use of a revolver during the commission
 of a murder, and on May 29, 2007, Petitioner was sentenced by the
 court. On June 8, 2007, Petitioner filed a notice of appeal.

On December 15, 2009, the ICA vacated the court’s
 
judgment and remanded the case for a new trial based on its
 conclusion that the court erred in admitting the testimony of
 
11

NCIS Agent Robbins regarding the time-frame during which the 
revolver purportedly used in the murder was fired.9 Torres, 122 
Hawai'i at 34, 222 P.3d at 441. The ICA also concluded that 
(1) there was substantial independent evidence to corroborate Petitioner’s incriminating statements, and, therefore, the admission of such statements was correct, id. at 12, 222 P.3d at 419; (2) federal law, as opposed to Hawai' i law, applied to 
Petitioner’s motion to suppress, id. at 17, 222 P.3d at 424; and (3) under federal law, the search of Petitioner’s vehicle was
 lawful inasmuch as the search met federal exceptions to the
 search warrant requirement, id. at 20-26, 222 P.3d at 427-33. 
On April 7, 2010, Petitioner and Respondent each
 
applied for review of the ICA’s opinion. We rejected
 Respondent’s Application for Writ of Certiorari. As indicated,
 we accepted Petitioner’s Application to correct the ICA’s opinion
 with respect to the admissibility of evidence obtained by federal
 officers in a state court prosecution. 
9 In its Application, Respondent presented the question of whether
 
the ICA “gravely erred when it found that the [] court had abused its
discretion in admitting Agent Robbins’s lay opinion testimony regarding the
revolver found in [Petitioner’s] car[.]” The ICA concluded that the court
 “abused its discretion in admitting Agent Robbins’s time-frame testimony” that
 the revolver recovered from Petitioner was fired “within the same day,
 probably about eight hours or so[,]” because (1) Respondent “did not set forth
 a sufficient foundation” for the admission of the testimony as a lay opinion,
(2) Agent Robbins’s opinion “required expert testimony[,]” and (3) Respondent
“did not satisfy the foundational requirements for [the] admission of . . .[Agent Robbin’s] testimony as expert testimony.” Torres, 122 Hawai 'i at 28, 
222 P.3d at 435. The ICA thus concluded that Respondent “did not satisfy the foundational requirements for [the] admission” of Agent Robbin’s “time-frame testimony as expert testimony.” Id.

Petitioner presents the following questions in his
 
Application:
 
I. Whether the ICA gravely erred by holding that
[Respondent] presented substantial independent evidence
which corroborated Davis’[s] hearsay testimony regarding
[Petitioner’s]  inculpatory  statements [.10]
I
I. Whether the ICA gravely erred by determining that
federal law rather than Hawai 'i law should apply to
[Petitioner’s] suppression motion and also whether its
decision is inconsistent with State v. Bridges , 83 Haw[ai 'i] 
1
87, 925 P.2d [357] (1996) [.11]
I
II. Whether the ICA’s decision regarding exceptions to the
search warrant requirement is inconsistent with Arizona v.
Gant, [-- U.S. --,] 129 S. Ct. 1710 (2009)[,] and whether
the ICA gravely erred by determining that other exceptions
t
o the warrant requirement applied [.12]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
III.
 
This court has not yet squarely addressed the
 
circumstances under which evidence obtained by federal law
 
enforcement officers must be evaluated in a state prosecution. 
In Bridges, this court considered the circumstances under which
 “evidence obtained in one state [must] be suppressed in a
 criminal prosecution in another state[.]” 83 Hawai' i at 194, 925 
P.2d at 364. Bridges noted that the issue “ha[d] been analyzed
 
10 Petitioner contends that his incriminating statements to Davis 
were inadmissible because Respondent failed to introduce sufficient
independent evidence of the trustworthiness of the statements. However, weagree with the ICA that Respondent did introduce independent evidencecorroborating the essential facts set forth in Petitioner’s statements toDavis. Torres, 122 Hawai 'i at 12-13, 222 P.3d at 419-20. 
11
 As indicated infra, we review the ICA’s analysis with regard to
 
the second question presented in his Application.
 
12
 We conclude that Petitioner’s third question must be answered in
 
the negative. As indicated, we uphold that part of the ICA’s opinion which
affirmed the legality of the searches of Petitioner’s vehicle under federal
law. Moreover, as discussed infra, Gant is not relevant to the instant case.

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in two ways: conflicts of law analysis and an exclusionary rule
 
analysis.” Id. at 195, 925 P.2d at 365 (internal quotation marks
 
and citation omitted). “Under a conflicts of law approach,
 courts analyze the issue as if it were a civil case and apply the
 choice of law method of the forum state to determine whether the
 law of the forum state or the situs state should be followed,”
 and the “sanctions [] to be used if the appropriate law is
 violated.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
Under the alternative exclusionary rule analysis, “the
 
court first identifies the principles to be served by the
 
exclusionary rule, [ 13
 ] and then evaluates how the principles
would be served by exclusion.” Id.
 (internal quotation marks and
 
citation omitted). The Bridges court designated the exclusionary
 rule analysis, discussed infra, as the “better approach” to
 resolving issues regarding whether evidence obtained in another
 jurisdiction must be suppressed in a criminal prosecution in this
 state. Id.
 
In addition to the approaches set forth in Bridges, a
 
third group of jurisdictions apply its exclusionary rules and
 constitutional standards to all evidence proffered in its courts, 
13
 “The freedom of individuals from unreasonable searches and 
seizures is a fundamental guarantee provided for by the Fourth Amendment to
the United States Constitution and [a]rticle I, [s]ection 5 of theConstitution of the State of Hawaii.” State v. Abordo , 61 Haw. 117, 120, 596 
P.2d 773, 775 (1979). The “exclusionary rule” effectuates the right protected by article I, section 5 of the Hawai 'i Constitution, by “conferr[ing] upon
defendants in . . . criminal prosecutions[,] the right to have excluded fromtrial evidence which has been obtained by means of an unlawful search andseizure.” Id. (citations omitted).

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
without regard to where the evidence was obtained. See State v.
 
Davis, 834 P.2d 1008, 1012 (Or. 1992) (explaining that because
 
Oregon’s exclusionary rule protects individual rights, “[i]f the
 government seeks to rely on evidence in an Oregon criminal
 prosecution, that evidence must have been obtained in a manner
 that comports with the protections given to the individual by
 Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution”); see also
 State v. Cardenas-Alvarez
,
 25 P.3d 225, 232 (N.M. 2001) (noting
 
14
 “when a federal agent
 that, pursuant to the state constitution,  
effectuates [] an intrusion and the State proffers the evidence
 thereby seized in state court,” such evidence is “subject[ed] []
 to New Mexico’s exclusionary rule”). 
Finally, some jurisdictions have held that evidence
 
obtained by officers acting lawfully under the law of their own
 jurisdictions is admissible in state prosecutions. See Pena v.
 
State, 61 S.W.3d 745, 754 (Tex. App. 2001) (“Evidence that is
 obtained by federal agents acting lawfully and in conformity with
 federal authority is admissible in state proceedings.” 
(Citing
 
Gutierrez v. State, 22 S.W.3d 75, 84 (Tex. App. 2000).)). “This

 New Mexico Constitution, article II, section 10, provides as
 
follows:
 
The people shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes
and effects, from unreasonable searches and seizures, and no
warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing,
shall issue without describing the place to be searched, or
the persons or things to be seized, nor without a written
showing of probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.

doctrine.[ 15
 ]  The underlying concept of the [] doctrine is that
 
protections afforded by the constitution of a sovereign entity
 
control the actions only of the agents of that sovereign entity.” 
Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Another
 
rationale of courts adopting this approach has been that “a
 state’s constitution that will not be invoked to control the
 conduct of its private citizens will not be applied to control
 the conduct of the officers of a foreign jurisdiction.” E.g.,
 
State v. Mollica, 554 A.2d 1315, 1325 (N.J. 1989).
 
IV.
 
Reviewing the aforementioned approaches, we agree with
 
the ICA insofar as it determined that the exclusionary rule
 analysis applies to resolve the issue of whether evidence
 obtained by federal officers should be admitted in a state
 prosecution. However, Bridges also noted that
 
one could argue that evidence obtained in Hawai 'i by federal
officers in compliance with federal law (and therefore not
illegally obtained) but in violation of some morerestrictive aspect of Hawai 'i law should be suppressed in
criminal prosecutions in Hawai 'i state courts . See State v. 
15 The Supreme Court had once held that evidence unlawfully obtained
 
by state officers was admissible in federal court via a “silver platter.”
 Lustig v. United States , 338 U.S. 74, 78-79 (1949). The Court had reasoned
 
that evidence obtained by state officers was outside the Fourth Amendment
constitutional inquiry. See Weeks v. United States , 232 U.S. 383, 398 (1914).
This doctrine had been referred to as the “silver platter doctrine.” Notably,
in Elkins v. United States , 364 U.S. 206, 223 (1960), the Supreme Court
abolished this doctrine as unconstitutional. The Court held that “evidence
 obtained by state officers during a search which, if conducted by federal
officers, would have violated the defendant’s immunity from unreasonable
searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible . . . in a
 federal criminal trial.”
 
The “reverse silver platter” doctrine refers to instances where
 
state courts admit evidence obtained by federal officers in a manner that
would not violate federal authority, but would violate their own state law or
the state constitution.

evidence illegally seized by federal officers that is

evidence consistent with their own exclusionary rule.”). In
 the instant case, however, we need not, and do not, decide
that issue.
 
80 Hawai' i at 199 n.15, 925 P.2d at 369 n.15. In this aspect, 
Bridges recognized an approach akin to the third group of 
decisions that held all evidence proffered in the state courts were subject to the exclusionary rule standards under the State’s constitution. 
In this connection, in support of footnote 15, Bridges
 
cited to Rodriguez I, 823 P.2d at 1029-30.
16 In addressing the
 
defendant’s argument that his arrest by a federal agent was not
 valid under the Oregon Constitution because the federal
 administrative arrest warrant was not supported by oath and
 affirmation, the Court of Appeals of Oregon noted that Oregon’s
 constitutional provision, requiring that all warrants be
 supported by probable cause, oath, and affirmation, “does not
 limit its application.” Id. at 1029. That court declared that,
 
“[f]or the purpose of prosecuting state offenses in state courts,
 the validity of an arrest is measured by state standards.” Id. 
According to Rodriguez I, as to “state prosecutions in state 
16
 The Oregon Supreme Court’s decision, which overruled the decision
 
of the Court of Appeals of Oregon on other grounds, is discussed infra.
 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court[s], an arrest warrant is invalid if it is not supported by 
oath or affirmation.” Id. Bridges thus acknowledged the 
persuasiveness of the third approach. Thus, for the reasons discussed infra, we must disagree with the ICA’s holding that our exclusionary rule analysis “supports the application of federal law” alone in the instant case. Torres, 122 Hawai' i at 18, 222 
P.3d at 425. 
V.
 
Jurisdictions under this third approach have held that,
 
where evidence obtained by federal agents is sought to be
 admitted in a state court prosecution, the admission of such
 evidence requires consideration of the state constitution. For
 example, in Rodriguez II, 854 P.2d at 400, the “[d]efendant [was]
 an alien who had been convicted of possession of a controlled
 substance” and, as a result, was facing deportation. An agent of
 the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
 learned of the defendant’s conviction and obtained an
 administrative arrest warrant for his arrest. Id. While
 
attempting to execute the warrant, the INS agent obtained
 permission from the defendant to search the apartment. Id. at
 
400-01. The search revealed two guns, id. at 401, and when
 questioned, the defendant “stated that one of the guns was his”
 and that “the other . . . would have his fingerprints on it.” 
Id.
 
18
         
          
       
          
        
        
         
             
         
        
            
      
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The defendant was subsequently charged as a former
 
convict in possession of a firearm under Oregon state law. Id. 
Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress both the weapons
 
and his statements, arguing that “the administrative arrest
 warrant was not supported by oath or affirmation, as required by
 the Oregon and United States Constitutions, that the arrest was
 therefore unlawful, and that the guns and statements should be
 suppressed as the ‘fruit’ of the unlawful arrest.” Id. (footnote
 
omitted). The trial court denied the defendant’s motion. Id.
 
On appeal in Rodriguez I, as noted supra, the Oregon
 
Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant’s arrest was
 unlawful because the arrest warrant was not valid under the
 Oregon Constitution, and the arrest was not a valid warrantless
 arrest. Id. The Oregon Supreme Court overturned the decision of
 
the court of appeals on other grounds, but likewise held that
 evidence sought to be admitted in a state prosecution must
 comport with the Oregon Constitution. Id. at 402.
17 That court
 
stated: 
“If the government seeks to rely on evidence in an Oregon
criminal prosecution, that evidence must have been obtained
in a manner that comports with the protections given to the
individual by article I, section 9, [ 18
] of the Oregon
17
 The Oregon Supreme Court ultimately determined that the evidence
 
was admissible under the Oregon Constitution because the defendant “consented
 to the search that uncovered the guns, and that consent was not obtained by
exploitation of the unlawful conduct[.]” 854 P.2d at 405.
 
18
 Article I, section 9 of the Oregon Constitution provides:
 
No law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue

Constitution. It does not matter where that evidence was
 
obtained (in-state or out-of-state), or what governmental
entity (local, state, federal, or out-of-state) obtained it;
the constitutionally significant fact is that the Oregon
government seeks to use the evidence in an Oregon criminal
prosecution. Where that is true, the Oregon constitutional
protections apply .”
 
Id. at 403 (quoting Davis, 834 P.2d at 1012) (emphasis added). 
Similarly, in Cardenas-Alvarez, 25 P.3d at 227, a
 
federal agent seized eighty-five pounds of marijuana at a border
 
patrol checkpoint north of the Mexican border. At trial before
 the New Mexico state court, the defendant moved to suppress the
 evidence arguing, inter alia, that the evidence was obtained in
 violation of the New Mexico Constitution. Id. The trial court
 
denied the defendant’s motion and that decision was reversed by
 the court of appeals. On certiorari, the Supreme Court of New
 Mexico held that although the federal agent did not violate the
 federal constitution, the seizure of the evidence violated the
 New Mexico Constitution and, therefore, the evidence should be
 excluded in state court. Id.
 
The Supreme Court of New Mexico stated that it found
 
“no mandate in the text of [a]rticle II, [s]ection 10, [ 19
 ] nor in
[its] jurisprudence interpreting th[e] clause, to selectively
 protect New Mexico’s inhabitants from intrusions committed by
 
18(...continued)
b
ut upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,
and particularly describing the place to be searched and the
person or thing to be seized.
 
Id. at 402.
 
19
 See supra note 14 for the text of article II, section 10 of the
 
New Mexico Constitution.
 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
state but not federal governmental actors.” Id. at 232. 
Cardenas-Alvarez explained that, “[u]nlike the private actors[,]
 
. . . federal agents exercise jurisdiction over New Mexicans and
 possess the authority to systematically subject [New Mexico]
 inhabitants to searches, seizures and other interferences.” Id. 
According to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, “[a] federal agent
 who wields these powers unreasonably commits precisely the sort
 of ‘unwarranted governmental intrusion’ against which the New
 Mexico Constitution ensures.” Id. As said supra, it was held
 
that New Mexico’s exclusionary rule would be applied in the state
 court “when a federal agent effectuat[ed] such an intrusion[.]” 
Id.
 
In People v. Griminger, 524 N.E.2d 409, 410 (N.Y.
 
1988), federal agents obtained a search warrant from a federal
 magistrate to search the defendant’s home for narcotics based on
 information provided by an undisclosed informant. The search was
 executed by federal agents and Nassau County (New York) police
 officers. Id. “The search produced 10 ounces of marijuana, over
 
$6,000 in cash and drug-related paraphernalia[,]” and the
 defendant was subsequently charged with criminal possession of
 marijuana. Id. The issue before the Court of Appeals of New
 
York was whether the two-prong test set forth in Aguilar v.
 Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393
 U.S. 410 (1969), which New York had “adopted . . . as a matter of
 State constitutional law,” or the totality-of-the-circumstances
 
21
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
test adopted by the United States Supreme Court in Illinois v.
 
Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), “should be employed in determining
 the sufficiency of an affidavit submitted in support of a search
 warrant application[,]” Griminger, 524 N.E. 2d at 409.
 
The New York Court of Appeals declined to adopt the
 
Gates test, and reaffirmed the “Aguilar-Spinelli two-prong
 test[.]” Id. Additionally, the New York Court of Appeals
 
rejected the prosecution’s alternative argument that “[f]ederal
 law should apply . . . since the warrant was issued by a
 [f]ederal [m]agistrate and executed by [f]ederal agents.” Id. at
 
412. The Griminger court explained that a defendant tried under
 
the state’s penal law should be afforded the benefit of the
 state’s “search and seizure protections[.]” Id. (emphasis
 
added).
 
VI.
 
The previous cases indicate that under the third
 
approach, evidence obtained by federal officers must have been
 obtained lawfully under the constitutions of the respective
 states before being admitted in a state court prosecution. 
Similarly, some courts have held that where evidence obtained in
 one state (the situs state) is sought to be admitted in another
 state (the forum state), the forum state’s constitution and laws
 must be followed. 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
People v. Taylor, 804 P.2d 196, 198 (Colo. App. 1990),
 
concerned whether the phone records seized by North Dakota
 
officials in North Dakota should be suppressed in a Colorado
 state court prosecution. In that case, the defendant and her
 husband owned a bar in Durango, Colorado, and were suspected of
 arranging for others to cause an explosion in another bar located
 in Durango. Id. In the ensuing investigation, “a search
 
warrant, based upon an affidavit drafted by a Colorado
 prosecutor, was issued by a North Dakota court to obtain the
 defendant’s telephone records.” Id. “Pursuant to the search
 
warrant, North Dakota officials seized the defendant’s phone
 records, . . . and the records were subsequently admitted into
 evidence” at the defendant’s Colorado trial. Id.
 
On appeal, the Colorado Court of Appeals distinguished
 
precedent in which the Supreme Court of Colorado held that in a
 state court prosecution, the exclusionary rule did not require
 suppression of a defendant’s confession that was obtained in
 violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Id. The
 
Colorado Court of Appeals pointed out that, unlike that case, the
 defendant in the case before it, had “assert[ed] a constitutional
 violation and not simply the violation of a rule of criminal
 procedure.” Id. That court concluded that “if there was a
 
violation of the defendant’s Colorado constitutional rights, then
 exclusion of the evidence would be mandated even though the 
23
          
        
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
evidence may have been properly seized under the laws of the
 
situs state.”20 Id.
 
In Stidham v. State, 608 N.E.2d 699, 700 (Ind. 1993),
 
the defendant appealed his conviction for, inter alia, murder. 
The incident giving rise to the defendant’s murder charge
 occurred in Indiana, but the defendant was arrested in Illinois
 after driving there following the incident. Id. The defendant
 
made incriminating remarks during the course of his arrest. 
After contacting police officers in Indiana, the Illinois
 officers gave the defendant Miranda warnings and questioned the
 defendant, who was seventeen years old. Id.
 
On appeal, the Indiana Supreme Court noted that under
 
Indiana law, a statement made by a person under the age of
 eighteen is not admissible unless counsel, the minor’s custodial
 parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem is present, and both the
 minor and his representative waive the minor’s right to remain
 silent. Id. That court rejected the prosecution’s contention
 
that because the statement of the defendant was lawfully obtained
 in Illinois, i.e., the situs state, it could be admitted in the
 Indiana court. Id. at 701. 
The Stidham court explained that it was “fully aware of
 
the cases . . . wherein other jurisdictions have held that in
 situations such as this, the statement would be admissible in the

 That court ultimately concluded that the telephone records were
 
obtained lawfully under the Colorado Constitution. See Taylor , 804 P.2d at
 
198-99.

prosecuting state.” Id. (citations omitted). However, Stidham
 
rejected the holdings in those cases, concluding that the proper
 
inquiry was “the admissibility of [a] statement obtained in
 Illinois in a prosecution taking place in Indiana.” Id. The
 
Indiana Supreme Court ultimately held that the confession made by
 the defendant in Illinois after he was given his Miranda warnings
 was inadmissible under the Indiana statute. Id.; see also State
 
v. Camargo, 498 A.2d 292, 296 (N.H. 1985) (holding that evidence
 obtained by a Massachusetts police officer was not admissible in
 New Hampshire because the “warrantless seizure and subsequent
 search of the defendant’s vehicle were unreasonable under the
 State Constitution because no exigent circumstances existed to
 justify a warrantless search”); State v. Platt, 574 A.2d 789,
 791-95 (Vt. 1990) (analyzing the legality of the seizure of the
 defendant’s car by Massachusetts police officers under the
 Vermont Constitution). 
VII.
 
While we do not adopt the approach set forth in the 
foregoing cases in its entirety, those cases would appear to have merit. The ICA had concluded that under Bridges, federal law applied to the searches at issue in the instant case. Torres, 
122 Hawai' i at 18, 222 P.3d at 425. The ICA explained that “PHNB 
is akin to a separate jurisdiction or a situs state for purposes of the Bridges analysis[.]” Id. at 18, 222 P.3d at 425. But, to 
reiterate, Bridges acknowledged that “one could argue that 
25
         
        
       
          
       
         
      
        
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
evidence obtained in Hawai' i by federal officers in compliance 
with federal law . . . but in violation of . . . Hawai' i law 
should be suppressed in criminal prosecutions in Hawai' i state 
courts.” 83 Hawai' i at 199 n.15, 925 P.2d at 369 n.15. 
In the ICA’s view, it was not clear that footnote 15 
“contemplated the situation presented here, where the activities 
of the federal officers took place on a closed military base that was subject to the control of a military commander and was within the . . . jurisdiction of the United States.” Torres, 122 
Hawai'i at 20, 222 P.3d at 427. Thus, the ICA concluded that the 
“Bridges analysis, and the Bridges rationale for applying the law of the situs state support[ed] the application of federal law in this case.” Id. However, Bridges’ reliance on Rodriguez I 
reveals that Bridges did refer to circumstances presented in the instant case beyond simply the law of the situs state. In that light due consideration must be given to the third approach. 
VIII.
 
An exclusionary rule analysis requires us to consider
 
the principles served by that rule. See supra. Bridges
 
identified three purposes underlying our exclusionary rule: 
judicial integrity, protection of individual privacy, and
 deterrence of illegal police misconduct. This court stated that
 
[i]n Hawai 'i, we have recognized a number of purposes
underlying our exclusionary rule: (1) judicial integrity, 
State v. Pattioay , 78 Hawai 'i 455, 468, 896 P.2d 911, 924
(1995) (“to ensure that evidence illegally obtained bygovernment officials or their agents is not utilized in theadministration of criminal justice through the courts”);(2) individual privacy, [Lopez] , 78 Hawai 'i [at] 446, 896
P.2d [at] 902 [] (“to protect the privacy rights of our 
26
         
     
          
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
citizens” (emphasis omitted)); and, of course,
(3) deterrence, Pattioay , 78 Hawai 'i at 468, 896 P.2d at 924
(“to deter illegal police conduct”). 
83 Hawai' i at 195, 925 P.2d at 365. 
A.
 
“The ‘judicial integrity’ purpose of the exclusionary
 
rule is essentially that the courts should not place their
 
imprimatur on evidence that was illegally obtained by allowing it
 to be admitted into evidence in a criminal prosecution.” Id. at
 
196, 925 P.2d at 366. According to Bridges, “[a]s a general
 rule, the question of whether given conduct is legal is answered
 by looking to the laws of the jurisdiction in which that conduct
 was performed, i.e., the situs state.” Id. (citation omitted). 
Consequently, Bridges reasoned that because in that case, “[t]he
 evidence was apparently obtained in compliance with the laws of
 the state of California[,] . . . under the general rule,”
 admission of the evidence “would not cause a loss of judicial
 integrity.” Id. 
Relying on Bridges, the ICA noted that (1) “[n]o 
Hawai'i law enforcement officer was involved in the searches of 
[Petitioner’s] car”; and (2) “[t]he searches were conducted on a federal military base by federal officers whose activities were governed by federal law[.]” Torres, 122 Hawai' i at 19, 222 P.3d 
at 426. The ICA thus concluded that, “[a]s long as the evidence was obtained by the federal officers in compliance with federal law, Hawai' i courts would not be placing their imprimatur on 
27
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
evidence that was illegally obtained by allowing the evidence to
 
be admitted.” Id.
 
Although Bridges stated that it was applying the 
exclusionary rule analysis, Bridges’ consideration of only the jurisdiction in which the evidence was obtained seemingly reflected a conflicts of law approach. See Jennifer Friesen, 
State Constitutional Law § 11-3(d)(3) n.85.1 (2d ed. Supp. 1999) (citing Bridges as a conflicts of law case). Indeed, the cases Bridges cited to support its conclusion that “the question of whether given conduct is legal is answered by looking to the laws of the jurisdiction in which that conduct was performed, i.e., the situs state[,]” 83 Hawai' i at 196, 925 P.2d at 366, did not 
apply an exclusionary rule analysis. See United States v. 
Gerena, 667 F. Supp. 911, 919 (D. Conn. 1987) (noting that with respect to state conflicts, under a conflicts of law approach, “states generally determine the legality of alleged police conduct through application of the law of the place where the conduct occurred”); Menefee v. State, 640 P.2d 1381, 1384 (Okla. Crim. App. 1982) (noting, without regard to its exclusionary rule, that “it is well established in federal and other state jurisdictions that the law of the state in which a warrantless arrest takes place determines the validity of the arrest”) (citations omitted); accord State v. Cooper, 573 P.2d 1006, 1008 (Kan. 1977). 
28
         
         
              
          
            
       
           
            
          
          
           
         
          
           
           
           
         
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
It is manifest that Hawai' i courts are bound to follow 
the Constitution of Hawai' i. Thus, with regard to judicial 
integrity, Bridges failed to consider that if state courts
 
admitted evidence in a state prosecution that was obtained in a
 manner that would be unlawful under our constitution, our courts
 would necessarily be placing their imprimatur of approval on
 evidence that would otherwise be deemed illegal, thus
 compromising the integrity of our courts. This court has
 acknowledged that our exclusionary rule “recognize[s] that the
 courts of this State have the inherent supervisory power over
 criminal prosecutions to ensure that evidence illegally obtained
 by government officials or their agents is not utilized in the
 administration of criminal justice through the courts.” 
Pattioay, 78 Hawai' i at 468, 896 P.2d at 924. In light of the 
foregoing considerations, we conclude that where the admission of
 evidence obtained in another jurisdiction would violate our
 constitution, the court must give substantial weight
21 to the
 
21 Our courts regularly apply similar standards. See e.g. , Russell
 
v. Blackwell , 53 Haw. 274, 280, 492 P.2d 953, 957 (1972) (“The fact that the
defendant was represented by counsel and acted after consultation with counsel
is to be given substantial weight in determining the issue of voluntariness of
plea.”) (Internal quotation marks, parenthesis, ellipsis, and citationsomitted.) (Emphasis added.); see also State v. Wakisaka , 102 Hawai 'i 504, 514,
78 P.3d 317, 327 (2003) (stating that a defendant raising a claim ofineffective assistance of counsel has the burden of establishing “1) thatthere were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel’s lack of skill,judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted ineither the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense”) (emphasis added); HRS § 706-625(3) (Supp. 2010) (“The court shallrevoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with asubstantial requirement imposed as a condition of the order or has been
convicted of a felony.) (Emphasis added.) In plain language, “substantial” means “significantly great” and “considerable in quantity.” Merriam Webster’s 
Collegiate Dictionary 1174 (10th ed. 1989). 
29
         
         
           
             
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fact that such admission may compromise the judicial integrity of
 
our courts.22
 
B.
 
According to Bridges, a defendant’s privacy rights are 
to be found within the realm of the situs court jurisprudence inasmuch as a defendant would ordinarily look to that jurisdiction to protect his or her privacy rights and would reasonably expect government conduct to conform to the laws of that jurisdiction. See 83 Hawai' i at 198-99, 925 P.2d at 368-69. 
This would seem to be logical where the case is tried in such a foreign jurisdiction so that protection would be afforded by the courts of that jurisdiction. However, Bridges also indicated that a defendant’s privacy rights may be defined under the Hawai'i Constitution inasmuch as “one could argue” that evidence 
obtained lawfully in Hawai' i under federal law but in violation 
of Hawai' i law should be suppressed in a state prosecution. Id. 
at 199 n.15, 925 P.2d at 369 n.15. 
This court has determined that “‘[u]nlike the 
exclusionary rule on the federal level, Hawai' i’s exclusionary 
rule serves not only to deter illegal police conduct, but to protect the privacy rights of our citizens.’” State v. Kahoonei, 
83 Hawai' i 124, 131, 925 P.2d 294, 301 (1996) (quoting Lopez, 78 
22
 We note that, where evidence is recovered in another jurisdiction, 
there may be circumstances in which an intrusion upon a defendant’s privacy
rights, as defined by Hawai 'i law, may be of a minimal nature, such that
admission of the evidence would not substantially weigh on judicial integrity. 
30
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawai'i at 445, 896 P.2d at 901); see also State v. Dixon, 83 
Hawai'i 13, 23, 924 P.2d 181, 191 (1996) (stating that “article 
I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution provides broader 
protection than the [F]ourth [A]mendment to the United States 
Constitution because it also protects against unreasonable invasions of privacy”); State v. Navas, 81 Hawai' i 113, 123, 913 
P.2d 39, 49 (1996) (stating that “article I, section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution” provides a “more extensive right of privacy 
. . . than that of the United States Constitution”); State v. Tanaka, 67 Haw. 658, 662, 701 P.2d 1274, 1276 (1985) (“In our view, article I, § 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution recognizes an 
expectation of privacy beyond the parallel provisions in the Federal Bill of Rights.”); Hanson I, 97 Hawai' i at 82, 34 P.3d at 
12 (“The Hawai' i Supreme Court has concluded that a person’s 
expectation of privacy under article 1, § 7 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution is greater than that under the [F]ourth [A]mendment to the United States Constitution.”) (Citation omitted.) Because our exclusionary rule is unlike the exclusionary rules of the federal government and some other jurisdictions insofar as it guarantees individual privacy rights, consideration of the Hawai'i Constitution and applicable case law is mandated. 
Consequently, it would seem apparent that the question
 
of whether or not the privacy rights of a defendant who is tried
 in our courts and under our penal law have been violated, should
 not be governed by the law and constitution of jurisdictions that
 
31
         
            
           
            
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
have deemed privacy rights irrelevant.23 To reiterate, our 
exclusionary rule seeks to protect the individual privacy rights 
of the defendant. Because those rights necessarily stem from our state constitution, our exclusionary rule analysis requires the defendant’s privacy rights, as defined by the Hawai' i 
Constitution and applicable case law, be given substantial weight when another jurisdiction’s law is involved. 
C.
 
The final purpose of the exclusionary rule is 
deterrence. This court has defined deterrence as “the expectation that after evidence is suppressed based on [a] particular police conduct[,] . . . in the future, police officers will refrain from that type of conduct.” Bridges, 83 Hawai' i at 
199, 925 P.2d 369. It is plain that the suppression of evidence obtained by Hawai' i law enforcement officers in another 
jurisdiction, where such evidence was unlawfully seized under the laws or Constitution of Hawai' i, would deter Hawai 'i law 
enforcement officers from engaging in that type of conduct in the future. 
In this instance, however, as the ICA explained, 
“[b]ecause no Hawai' i law enforcement officer was involved[,] 
. . . there was no possible misconduct by Hawai' i law enforcement 
23
 It may be noted that applying the laws of the situs may be
 
difficult, if not impossible, where the jurisdiction has no law that could
resolve the issues raised in a defendant’s motion to suppress inasmuch as the
courts of this state have no authority to declare the laws of another
jurisdiction.
 
32
         
         
          
              
             
            
          
           
          
         
         
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
officers to deter.” Torres, 122 Hawai' i at 19, 222 P.3d at 426. 
The ICA thus held that “[a]pplying Hawai' i law to suppress the 
results of the searches would have little, if any, deterrent 
effect on the federal officers.” Id. However, the application 
of the Hawai' i exclusionary rule factors in future cases would 
deter any federal and state cooperation “to evade state law.” Friesen, supra, § 11-3(d)(3). In sum, considerations of judicial integrity, individual privacy, and deterrence apply to Petitioner’s motion to suppress. 
IX.
 
As indicated, Bridges does not reflect a consistent 
application of the exclusionary rule analysis.
24 Therefore, it 
is overruled insofar as it is inconsistent with this opinion. Hence, we must respectfully disagree with the ICA’s analysis in the instant case insofar as it relied on Bridges. We therefore conclude that, where evidence sought to be admitted in state court is the product of acts that occurred on federal property or in another state, by Hawai' i law enforcement officers or officers 
of another jurisdiction, due consideration, as we have set forth 
24
 This court has said that Hawai 'i’s exclusionary rule serves to 
protect the privacy rights of persons within Hawai 'i’s jurisdiction, not only 
to deter illegal police conduct. See Lopez , 78 Hawai 'i at 445, 896 P.2d at 
901. Thus, if, as Bridges stated, the exclusionary rule analysis looks to the
laws of the jurisdiction in which the conduct occurred, our courts would not
need to consider whether the defendant’s individual privacy rights had beencompromised when such evidence is introduced in a Hawai 'i state prosecution. 
Hence, Bridges ’ consideration of only the foreign state’s law rendered the
application of the exclusionary rule analysis in that case internallyinconsistent, insofar as Bridges stated that individual privacy rights under
the Hawai 'i Constitution should be considered. 
33
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
herein, must be given to the Hawai' i Constitution and applicable 
case law. 
X.
 
A.
 
We next consider whether the searches of Petitioner’s 
vehicle were valid under the Hawai' i Constitution, 
notwithstanding the fact that they were lawful under the United States Constitution. In the instant case, we agree with the court’s conclusion that Petitioner’s conduct of driving onto PHNB demonstrated that he consented to a search of his person and property under his control. See conclusion 5. 
“[C]onsent is an exception to and dispenses with the 
requirement of a warrant.” Hanson II, 97 Hawai' i at 76, 34 P.3d 
at 6 (citations omitted). In Hanson II, when the defendant, scheduled to fly on a Hawaiian Airlines flight, arrived at the Hawaiian Airlines ticket counter to check in, a Honolulu Airport security officer placed the defendant’s toolbox through an “x-ray” machine but was unable to identify everything within the toolbox. Id. at 72, 34 P.3d at 2. When the defendant opened the 
tool box for the security officer, a tan plastic bag wrapped in duct tape was discovered, the contents of which could not be identified. Id. The security officer opened the plastic bag and 
discovered a second plastic bag. That bag contained a white cardboard box from which a black handgun was recovered. Id. The 
defendant, who was charged with failing to register a firearm, 
34
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the
 
search. Id.
 
Although the defendant did not expressly indicate that
 
he consented to a search of his toolbox or the contents therein,
 this court held that inasmuch as “[c]onsent may also be implied
 from an individual’s words, gestures, or conduct[,]” the
 defendant had consented to the search of his tool box in
 voluntarily surrendering it for inspection. Id. at 75, 34 P.3d
 
at 5 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Hanson II
 
explained that “implied consent to an airport security search may
 be imputed from posted notices” and “the nature of airport
 security measures.” Id. (citations omitted). This court
 
additionally held that “[b]ecause the purpose of a security
 inspection can only be effectuated if the items subject to search
 can be identified, searches of such belongings must reasonably
 extend to those containers whose contents cannot be discerned.” 
Id.
 
As in Hanson II, in the instant case, there was a clear
 
and visible sign at the entrance of PHNB which stated: 
“Authorized Entry Onto This Installation Constitutes Consent To
 Search Of Personnel And The Property Under Their Control. 
Internal Security Act of 1950 Section 21; 50 U.S.C. 7979.” 
Finding 6. Any person who, after reading the sign, decided not
 to consent to a search of his or her person or property, could
 turn around and leave without having his or her person or
 
35
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
property searched. See finding 8. The guard shack, which a
 
person would have passed in order to gain entrance to the base,
 
was located approximately 50 feet beyond the sign, giving a
 person ample opportunity to turn around if he or she did not want
 to be subjected to a search of his or her person or property. 
See finding 9.
 
According to Petitioner, although there was a sign
 
posted 50 feet before the entrance to PHNB, he was not given the
 opportunity to decide whether to enter PHNB and turn around at
 the guard shack because Officer Aguilar “waved him down as he was
 entering the gate and then stopped his car just after the guard
 shack.” However, in his Application, Petitioner did not
 challenge any of the findings of the court, and, therefore, such
 findings are binding on this court. In any event, there is
 nothing to suggest that Petitioner indicated to Officer Aguilar
 in any way, that he did not want to enter PHNB and instead,
 wished to turn around at the guard shack. Officer Aguilar saw
 Petitioner in his vehicle, waiting to enter PHNB, and Petitioner
 did in fact enter PHNB. See findings 16, 17. It was only after
 
Petitioner entered PHNB that Officer Aguilar motioned for him to
 stop his vehicle, and only after he was informed that NCIS wanted
 to talk to him about the incident that Petitioner began to
 struggle to restart the vehicle, in a seeming attempt to exit
 PHNB. See finding 17, 18. 
36
         
          
             
            
            
             
           
            
         
            
           
            
          
            
             
          
          
           
            
            
            
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Inasmuch as “[c]onsent may . . . be implied from an
 
individual’s words, gestures, or conduct[,]” Hanson II, 97
 
Hawai'i at 75, 34 P.3d at 5, we conclude that Petitioner’s 
consent to the search of his vehicle may be implied from his act
 of driving past the guard shack and onto PHNB, and imputed from
 the posted notice indicating that entry onto PHNB constituted
 consent to a search.
25
 
B.
 
Petitioner noted that Sergeant Rozkiewicz and Officer
 
Aguilar testified there were search directives for random
 searches. We find federal search directives irrelevant in this
 case inasmuch as we conclude that the inspection of Petitioner’s
 vehicle was valid based on Petitioner’s implied consent to such
 search.
 
25
 Federal courts have likewise held that consent to a search of
 
one’s vehicle may be implied from entry onto a closed military base. See
 
Morgan v. United States , 323 F.3d 776, 778 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that
because military bases “often warn of the possibility of search as a condition
to entry, a warrantless search of a person seeking to enter a military base
may be deemed reasonable based on the implied consent of the person
searched”); Jenkins , 986 F.2d at 79 (stating that “[c]onsent is implied by the
 
totality of all the circumstances[,]” including “[t]he barbed-wire fence, the
security guards at the gate, the sign warning of the possibility of search,
and a civilian’s common-sense awareness of the nature of a military base[,]”
all of which “combine to puncture any reasonable expectations of privacy for a
civilian who enters a closed military base[]”) (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted); United States v. Ellis , 547 F.2d 863, 864 (5th Cir. 1977)
(“Consent to search a motor vehicle while on board a Naval Air Station was
validly obtained through issuance, acceptance and display of a visitor’s pass”
and therefore, “marijuana disclosed by a warrantless search made pursuant to
this consent was legally obtained”); United States v. Mathews , 431 F. Supp.
70, 73 (D.C. Okla. 1976) (concluding that because there were signs at the
entrance of the air force base indicating the property or personnel within the
control of those entering the base may be subject to search, “defendants had
 consented to their vehicle and persons being searched by entering the Military
Reservation”).
 
37
         
         
          
            
           
           
          
            
            
            
         
             
            
            
          
          
            
             
             
          
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Also, Petitioner does not point to any directive
 
alleged to have been violated. The court’s unchallenged finding
 
indicates that “[a]fter moving the vehicle, [Sergeant] Rozkiewicz
 followed base police procedures in securing the vehicle, which
 required police to check a vehicle that was going to be left
 unattended on base, for flammable or volatile substances such as
 gasoline, kerosene and explosives.” Finding 23.
26 For the
 
reasons set forth supra, we likewise conclude that the inspection
 of Petitioner’s vehicle by Sergeant Rozkiewicz was not
 unreasonable under the Hawai' i Constitution. 
XI.
 
Having determined that the inspection of Petitioner’s
 
vehicle by Sergeant Rozkiewicz was not unreasonable under the
 Hawai'i Constitution, we consider the legality of the second 
search of Petitioner’s vehicle. In his Application, Petitioner’s
 only argument with respect to the second search is that it was
 
26 Federal courts generally uphold searches that take place on closed
 
military bases as reasonable, without regard as to whether conducted pursuant
to federal search directives or procedures, and even in the absence of any
particularized suspicion. Jenkins , 986 F.2d at 78 (stating that “searches on
 
closed military bases have long been exempt from the usual Fourth Amendment
requirement of probable cause”) (citations omitted); Ellis, 547 F.2d at 866
(stating that “[t]he right to make a search [on a closed military base]
pursuant to [] consent does not turn on the presence of probable cause”);
United States v. Rogers , 549 F.2d 490, 493 (8th Cir. 1976) (upholding a
warrantless search of the defendant’s vehicle based on exigent circumstances,
and explaining that “because the search occurred on . . . a closed military
base, there is even less reason to question the propriety of the search”);
United States v. Vaughan , 475 F.2d 1262, 1264 (10th Cir. 1973) (stating that
once the defendant entered the closed military base, “a search conducted
 without probable cause and without consent could be proper” and “the
 submission to search could be imposed as a valid condition to gaining access
to the base”); United States v. Grisby , 335 F.2d 652, 654-55 (4th Cir. 1964)
(stating that “[t]he authority . . . of a military picket to search any
automobile entering a military reservation is widely recognized and has been
judicially upheld”).

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“tainted” by the first search, i.e., the inspection of
 
Petitioner’s vehicle by Sergeant Rozkiewicz. According to
 Petitioner, “[i]f the first search was unconstitutional,
 [Respondent] must show that the subsequent search is not the
 fruit of the prior search” or at least, “the dissipation of the
 taint.” (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.) 
Petitioner maintains that because “the affidavit submitted in
 support of the Command Authorization relied heavily on [Sergeant]
 Rozkiewicz’s statements regarding his observations during the
 first search[,]” the search conducted pursuant to the Command
 Authorization “was still tainted by the prior illegal search and
 was therefore invalid.” (Citation omitted.)
 
With respect to Petitioner’s argument that the second 
search was the “fruit” of or tainted by the inspection of his vehicle by Sergeant Rozkiewicz, because we have held that the first search did not violate the Hawai' i Constitution, it follows 
that the evidence obtained pursuant to the Command Authorization was neither the “fruit” of an unlawful search, nor tainted by the inspection of Petitioner’s vehicle by Sergeant Rozkiewicz. Alternatively, by entering onto PHNB, Petitioner consented to the second search of his vehicle as well as the inspection of his vehicle by Sergeant Rozkiewicz.

Inasmuch as Petitioner’s privacy rights under the 
Hawai'i Constitution were not invaded by the searches in this 
39
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
case, the individual privacy rights prong of our exclusionary
 
rule analysis does not weigh in favor of suppression. In that
 vein, judicial integrity would not be compromised. Thus, the
 evidence is admissible against Petitioner in his re-trial.

Petitioner’s third question in his Application contends
 
that the ICA’s decision was inconsistent with Gant, -- U.S. at
 --, 129 S.Ct. at 1714, and that the ICA gravely erred in
 determining that other exceptions to the warrant requirement
 applied in the instant case. It is observed that Gant has raised
 some questions about the viability of the Supreme Court’s holding
 in New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 460 (1981), “that when a
 policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of
 an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that
 arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.” 
(Footnotes omitted.) 
In Gant, the defendant “was arrested for driving [with]
 
a suspended license, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car
 before officers searched his car and found cocaine in a jacket
 pocket.” -- U.S. at --, 129 S.Ct. at 1714. The Court held “that
 Belton does not authorize a vehicle search incident to a recent
 occupant’s arrest after the arrestee has been secured and cannot
 access the interior of the vehicle.” Id. Gant additionally
 
“conclude[d] that circumstances unique to the automobile context
 justify a search incident to arrest when it is reasonable to
 
40
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
believe that evidence of the offense of arrest might be found in
 
the vehicle.” Id. 
As indicated previously, we affirm the ICA’s decision 
insofar as it upheld the searches of Petitioner’s vehicle as valid under federal law and the United States Constitution. We observe that the ICA did not determine that any of the searches of Petitioner’s vehicle were justified on the ground that the search was incident to a lawful arrest and so did not consider Gant. In any event, Gant is not applicable to the instant case inasmuch as it is distinguishable. Unlike in Gant, the searches of Petitioner’s car took place on a closed military base such that consent to such searches may be implied. Morgan, 323 F.3d 
at 778 (holding that “consent to a search of one’s vehicle may be implied from entry onto a closed military base”); see also Jenkins, 986 F.2d at 79 (stating that “[c]onsent is implied by the totality of all the circumstances[,]” including “[t]he barbed-wire fence, the security guards at the gate, the sign warning of the possibility of search, and a civilian’s common-sense awareness of the nature of a military base[,]” all of which “combine to puncture any reasonable expectations of privacy for a civilian who enters a closed military base[]”). Because we have concluded that upon entering PHNB Petitioner impliedly consented to a search of himself and his property, we need not reach the issues raised in Gant with respect to the Hawai'i Constitution.

Based on the foregoing, we correct the ICA’s opinion 
insofar as it concluded that federal law alone was to be 
considered in ruling on Petitioner’s motion to suppress. We affirm the December 5, 2006 order of the court denying Petitioner’s motion to suppress under federal law and the Hawai' i 
Constitution. The January 7, 2010 Judgment of the ICA is accordingly affirmed.
