STATE OF HAWAI #I,
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee
vs.
ZACHARIAH I. FITZWATER,
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
(HPD TRAFFIC NO. 1DTC-07-020562)
ORDER OF AMENDMENT
(By:  Acoba, J.)
The concurring and dissenting opinion by Acoba, J.,
appended to the opinion of the court filed on March 3, 2010, is
amended as follows (deletions are bracketed and additions are
double underscored):
Lines 16-20 from the top of page 25:   at [353-54] 412,
910 P.2d at [346-47] 725 [(stating that “an expert’s
assumption regarding the correct calibration of his
measuring device” constitutes inadmissible hearsay and
prosecution did not call the “manufacturer’s service
representative to testify to calibration of the balance”)]
(holding that “prosecution failed to lay a sound factual
foundation that the . . . ‘balance was accurate’” because
there was “no reliable evidence showing [it] was in proper
working order” where “[t]he service representative did nottestify at trial regarding his calibration of the balance”). 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to incorporate the
foregoing changes in the original concurring and dissenting
opinion by removing page 25 and replacing it with the page
attached hereto and take all necessary steps to notify the
publishing agencies of these changes.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 5, 2010.
