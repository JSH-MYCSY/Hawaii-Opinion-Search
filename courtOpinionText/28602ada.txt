CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
(CIV. NOS. 06-1-0265 & 06-1-0867)

MOON, C.J., NAKAYAMA, AND DUFFY, JJ., AND CIRCUIT
JUDGE CHAN, IN PLACE OF RECKTENWALD, J., RECUSED;
ACOBA, J., CONCURRING SEPARATELY
OPINION OF THE COURT BY MOON, C.J.
On October 13, 2009, this court accepted a timely
application for a writ of certiorari, filed by petitioners/
plaintiffs-appellants Keep the North Shore Country (KNSC) and
Sierra Club, Hawai# i Chapter (Sierra Club) [hereinafter,
collectively, plaintiffs] on September 8, 2009, requesting that
this court review the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) June
12, 2009 judgment on appeal, entered pursuant to its May 22, 2009
published opinion.  Unite Here! v. City & County of Honolulu, 120
Hawai#i 457, 209 P.3d 1271 (App. 2009).  Therein, the ICA
affirmed the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s1 June 4, 2007
amended final judgment in favor of respondents/defendants-
appellees Kuilima Resort (Kuilima), as well as the City and
County of Honolulu and Henry Eng, the director of the Department
of Planning and Permitting (DPP) [hereinafter, collectively, the* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-3-County and, along with Kuilima, collectively, defendants].  Oral
argument was held on December 17, 2009.
Briefly stated, this case arises from the proposed
expansion of the Kuilima Resort at Turtle Bay on the North Shore
of O#ahu for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) was
completed, pursuant to the Hawai# i Environmental Policy Act
(HEPA) (codified as Hawai #i Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 343),
discussed infra, and accepted in 1985 by the Department of Land
Utilization (DLU) [hereinafter, the 1985 EIS].  The dispute
centers around whether Kuilima’s subdivision application, filed
in 2005, triggered the need for a supplemental EIS (SEIS),
pursuant to the administrative rules underlying HEPA,
specifically, Hawai #i Administrative Regulations (HAR)
§§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27 (governing SEISs), quoted infra at
n.12 & 13.  The circuit court, in granting summary judgment in
favor of the defendants, ruled that a SEIS was not required, and
the plaintiffs appealed.
On appeal, a majority of the ICA agreed with the
circuit court, holding, inter alia, that, pursuant to the plain
language of HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27, a SEIS was required
only where there was a substantial change in the “action,” see
HAR § 11-200-26, quoted infra, and that, inasmuch as the
defendants were not substantially changing the proposed expansion
itself, no SEIS was required.  Unite Here!, 120 Hawai# i at 465-
67, 209 P.3d at 1279-81.  Then-Associate Judge Nakamura* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-4-dissented, asserting that, in his view, the relevant rules
required the completion of a SEIS “when significant changes to
the anticipated environmental impacts of a proposed action become
apparent such that ‘an essentially different action’ is being
proposed.”  Id. at 468, 209 P.3d at 1282 (Nakamura, J.,
dissenting).
On application, the plaintiffs urge this court to adopt
Judge Nakamura’s view that HEPA mandates the completion of a SEIS
where there has been a change in circumstances or increased
environmental impacts and that, therefore, the DPP (the accepting
agency for Kuilima’s subdivision application) should have
required Kuilima to do so. 
Based on the discussion below, we hold that the ICA’s
majority erred in its interpretation of the relevant HARs and,
consequently, incorrectly affirmed the circuit court’s grant of
summary judgment in favor of the defendants.  Accordingly, we
vacate the ICA’s June 12, 2009 judgment on appeal, the circuit
court’s June 4, 2007 amended final judgment in favor of the
defendants, and remand this case to the circuit court with
instructions to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. 
I.  BACKGROUND
 A. Background Information
As aptly summarized by the ICA:
In the 1980[]s, Kuilima’s predecessor in interest,
Kuilima Development Company (KDC), owned a resort on the
North Shore of the [i]sland of O #ahu.  The resort consisted* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-5-of a 487-room hotel and an 18-hole golf course.  KDC
proposed the Kuilima Resort Expansion ([p]roject), which
would involve expansion of the existing hotel and new
construction of three hotels for total of 1,450+ new units;
renovation of the existing 18-hole golf course; and new
construction of 2,060+ condominium units, a 70,000+ sq. ft.
commercial complex, an 18-hole golf course and clubhouse, a
tennis center, and an equestrian center.  The [p]roject also
called for infrastructure and public improvements, including
a new wastewater treatment plant, a production water well, a
standby well, a new reservoir, new water distribution lines,
improvements to the portion of Kamehameha Highway fronting
the resort, two private and two public beach parks, a
wildlife preserve that included virtually all of Punahoolapa
Marsh, and public rights-of-way to the shoreline.
Unite Here!, 120 Hawai# i at 459, 209 P.3d at 1273.
1. 1985 EIS
On August 5, 1985 and in accordance with HEPA, a Draft
EIS was prepared and filed with the Office of Environmental
Quality Control (OEQC) and, thereafter, published in the OEQC
bulletin on August 8, 1985.  Public comment contributed to the
preparation of a revised EIS, which was submitted to the DLU on
October 7, 1985.  The revised EIS was accepted on October 30,
1985 [hereinafter, the EIS or 1985 EIS]. 
According to the EIS, the proposed project was to be
developed in three phases:  (1) phase I starting in 1986;
(2) phase II in 1988-89; and (3) phase III between 1993 and 1996. 
The 1985 EIS also indicated that, “[a]t full development, the
expanded facilities of the resort would introduce a new visitor
population averaging about 4,783 persons on any given day.”  With
regard to evaluation of the environmental setting of the project
area and the probable impact of the proposed project on the
environment, the 1985 EIS looked to topography and drainage,* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-6-soils, water resources and usage, tsunami/flood hazards, coastal
water quality, vegetation, sand dunes, threatened or endangered
endemic species of birds, Punaho# olapa marsh, historical and
archaelogical resources, agriculture, and air quality, as well as
traffic and road conditions. 
In its analysis of the coastal waters, specifically 
Kawela Bay, which borders the project, the 1985 EIS referenced
the potential impact of “desilting” on green sea turtles, a
“threatened” species under the federal Endangered Species Act
(ESA).  More specifically, it noted that “the desilting operation
would be located across the area where the abundant growths of
algae that are known to be important diet items of [green sea
turtles] are found.”  There was no reference to any anticipated
impact upon the Hawaiian monk seal, an “endangered” species under
the ESA.
The EIS also analyzed the “adverse and unavoidable
impacts” of the project’s development.  These identified impacts
included drainage, traffic, dust generation, water consumption,
marsh drainage input, loss of agricultural uses, construction
noise, air quality, and solid waste disposal.  
In addressing the adverse and unavoidable traffic
impacts of the project, the 1985 EIS relied upon a traffic study
that examined the traffic conditions caused by an increase in
visitors to the North Shore region on O #ahu (between Haleiwa and* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-7-Punalu #u), with projections through the year 2000.  Specifically,
the 1985 EIS recognized that:
[a]ccess to the project site is via Kamehameha Highway. 
Kamehameha Highway is the only arterial highway serving the
North Shore and Windward O# ahu.  It is a two-lane, two-way,
undivided State highway generally following the coastline,
except for the Kahuku area where it turns inland.  The
roadway width of Kamehameha Highway varies between 20 and 24
feet, with generally unpaved shoulders.  The highway varies
from flat straightaways with few driveway connections to a
curvilinear alignment with many driveway connections. 
Between Kahuku and Haleiwa, there are no provisions for
left-turn lanes or bus turnouts (except at Waimea Bay).
In most of the communities between Haleiwa and Punalu# u, the
great majority of residents live within a few blocks of
Kamehameha Highway.  The highway is each community’s link
with the rest of O# ahu and a sense of increasing congestion
is a major source of concern of area residents.  Field
investigations of traffic conditions on weekends and
holidays show that traffic congestion occurs because of
“bottleneck” locations rather than a breakdown of the
overall highway facility.  This indicates that the highway’s
capacity restraint is not the number of lanes on the roadway
but rather highway geometrics and increased roadside
activity.
Haleiwa and Waimea Bay are the primary capacity restraints
along the North Shore.  The narrow Anahulu Bridge located
near Haleiwa Beach Park requires opposing stream of vehicles
to slow down.  Through Haleiwa, left-turn traffic and
motorists pulling off to park on the roadside queue traffic
in both directions.  Similarly, at Waimea Bay, motorists
parking on the roadside and turning left into Waimea Beach
Park or into Waimea Valley Road queue traffic in both
directions.  The curvilinear highway alignment along Waimea
Bay causes a further slowdown.  Finally, the vehicles parked
on the roadside impose additional restraints on capacity and
operating speeds.  Similar frictional effects occur at other
beach parks such as at Pupukea, Sunset, Hau# ula and Swanzy
Beach Parks when large gatherings occur (a surf meet or a
community picnic).  Furthermore, periodic slowdowns occur
behind [city] buses stopping in the highway to pick up or
drop off passengers.
On the Windward side, between Kuilima to Laie, there are no
restraints on capacity other than the highway itself.
The 1985 EIS reported that, “[o]n the regional level,
previous studies have recognized the highway alignment problems
at Waimea Bay and the need for upgrade of the existing Kamehameha
Highway.”  (Emphasis added.)  Relying on a 1985 traffic study* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-8-analyzing the existing regional traffic impacts in the Kahuku,
Kawailoa, and Hau# ula areas, the 1985 EIS projected -- to the
year 2000 -- the traffic impacts to the aforementioned areas
(1) without the resort expansion and (2) with the resort
expansion.  In comparing the “with” and “without” resort
expansion impacts, the 1985 EIS indicates that the construction
of the resort expansion would increase traffic impacts by an
average of 37.4% in Kahuku, 14.3% in Kawailoa, and 6.4% in
Hau#ula. 
The EIS observed that, in order to mitigate the impact
of entry into the project from -- and exiting the project onto --
Kamehameha Highway, at full development, the traffic study
recommended:  (1) the construction of a left-turn lane on
Kamehameha Highway at the existing Kuilima Drive (the main access
road to the resort); (2) the construction of fully channelized
intersections on Kamehameha Highway with turning lanes at the
proposed West Kuilima Drive (also known as the project’s “Alpha
Road”) and at the existing Kahuku Airport Road; (3) the
installation of traffic signals on Kamehameha Highway where it
intersects with Kuilima Drive, Kahuku Airport Road, and the
proposed West Kuilima Drive; and (4) minimization of visitors’
use of automobiles by instituting, for example, an airport
shuttle service.  Despite the suggested improvements, the EIS --
quoting the traffic study -- also observed that, “[w]hile the
increased traffic generated by the proposed resort expansion is* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-9-significant when compared to the projected background conditions,
it is not beyond the carrying capacity of an upgraded, high
quality two-lane arterial.” 
2. Initial Approvals and Delays in the Project’s
Development
As observed by the ICA:
The [1985] EIS listed additional governmental
approvals KDC needed to obtain in order to complete
development of the [p]roject, including rezoning approval
from the DLU, grading and building permits, a shoreline
certification, a Special Management Area Use Permit [(SMP)],
and subdivision approval.
On March 27, 1986, the Land Use Commission approved
the reclassification of 236 acres of the property from
[a]griculture . . . to [u]rban [d]istrict for resort and
golf course uses.
On May 23, 1986, the DLU accepted KDC’s application
for a [SMP] and [s]horeline [s]etback [v]ariance.  KDC
sought to expand its resort by developing a master-planned
resort community that would include hotels, dwellings,
commercial areas, golf courses, parks, roadways; to replace
two drainage culverts with open channels; and to conduct a
desilting operation at Kawela Bay.
On June 25, 1986, a bill for an ordinance to rezone
certain portions of the property to be developed under the
[p]roject was introduced before the [City Council].  The
bill incorporated the Unilateral Agreement and Declaration
for Conditional Zoning ([u]nilateral [a]greement), in which
KDC agreed that the zoning change would be subject to
conditions requiring, among other things, construction of a
wastewater treatment plant, construction of
low-to-moderate-income housing, improvements and
modifications to roadways, the implementation of a shuttle
service, and the establishment of a child care center,
parks, public easements to and along the shoreline, and
public parking.  Like the [1985] EIS, the [u]nilateral
[a]greement anticipated development to proceed in three
phases, the last phase to be completed before 2000.  The
[u]nilateral [a]greement noted that development may deviate
from the phased development schedule “due to the occurrence
of changed economic conditions, lawsuits, strikes or other
unforeseen circumstances.” 
The City Council passed the rezoning bill on August
14, 1986 and approved KDC’s application for the [SMP] and
[s]horeline [s]etback [v]ariance by resolution adopted on
October 1, 1986 (the March 27, 1986; August 14, 1986; and
October 1, 1986 approvals are collectively referred to as
the [p]roject [e]ntitlements).* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
 The record also contains references to a Department of Transportation,2
Highway Planning Branch’s traffic counts taken on Kamehameha Highway in front
of the resort, dated August 2000 (2000 DOT traffic count), and a Laniakea
Beach Park Traffic Impact Analysis Report, dated 2005 (2005 Laniakea traffic
report). 
-10-Over the next twenty years, only certain aspects of
the [p]roject were completed.  KDC constructed a wastewater
treatment plant and water main between January 1989 and
March 1990, the Opana Wells between February 1989 and March
1991, and the Palmer Golf Course between March 1989 and
March 1991.  Construction of improvements to Punahoolapa
Marsh began in approximately March 1990.  From 1990 through
1991, KDC obtained subdivision approvals for various parcels
to be used for parks, roads, hotels, a golf course, and a
golf clubhouse.
In March 1999, Kuilima purchased the property
underlying the [p]roject from KDC[,] and KDC assigned its
interest in the [p]roject to Kuilima.
In May 1999, the DPP drafted the Ko# olau Loa
Sustainable Communities Plan “to help guide public policy,
investment, and decision-making through the 2020 planning
horizon” in order to maintain and enhance “the region’s
ability to sustain its unique character, current population,
growing [sic], families, lifestyle, and economic
livelihood.”  The plan recognized and supported the
[p]roject.  The City Council adopted the plan on December
16, 1999.
Kuilima renovated the existing Fazio Golf Course
between 2000 and 2002.  In 2003, Kuilima obtained approval
to renovate and expand existing portions of the Turtle Bay
Resort.  Between 2003 and 2005, Kuilima invested about $100
million in completing these renovations, which included the
addition of nine resort condominium units.
As of November 2005, construction on the major
components of the [p]roject, including the hotel rooms and
the [remaining] condominium units, had not begun.
120 Hawai #i at 460-61, 209 P.3d at 1274-75 (emphasis added).
3. Other Relevant Post-1985 EIS Traffic Studies
After 1985, Kuilima solicited two additional traffic
impact analysis reports -- in 1991 and 2005.2  Because the 1985
EIS considered projected traffic impacts through the year 2000,
the 2005 updated traffic impact analysis [hereinafter, the 2005* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-11-report] and three addendums thereto, prepared in 2006, are
particularly relevant.  
The 2005 traffic report focused on local traffic
impacts, that is, impacts on the roadway fronting the property,
including the internal roadways of the resort itself.  Generally,
the 2005 traffic report indicated that, even with the
construction of certain traffic improvements (many of which
overlap with the yet incomplete improvements suggested by the
1985 EIS), the expansion project, when completed, would result in
increased local traffic impacts. 
As previously stated, the 2005 report was updated three
times in 2006, focusing again on only local traffic impacts.  
Addendum No. 1, dated February 15, 2006, evaluated the initial
design of the intersection of Kamehameha Highway and the
project’s Alpha Road (also known as the proposed West Kuilima
Drive), including turning lanes and the recommended improvements
to facilitate the traffic needs of that immediate area, projected
out through 2008.  The addendum concluded that,
[a]s Turtle Bay Resort continues to expand beyond the Year
2008, the peak hour traffic operations at the intersection
of Kamehameha Highway and Alpha Road are expected to
deteriorate below satisfactory levels of service [(LOS)]. 
Additional improvements at the study intersection, such as
traffic signalization and lane modifications, may be
required to mitigate the traffic impacts resulting from
further development of the Turtle Bay Resort.
(Emphasis added.)* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-12-Addendum No. 2, dated February 23, 2006, evaluated the
design of two-lane Alpha Road to determine when it should be
widened to a four-lane roadway.  It concluded that
Alpha Road will be constructed as a private roadway and is
expected to remain so in the foreseeable future.  Traffic
operations of the two-lane section of Alpha Road at peak
hour volumes over 800 [vehicles per hour] would result in a
[below satisfactory LOS].  In general, intersection
operations are more critical than the operation of a
continuous two-lane roadway.  The proposed 108-foot right of
way will provide adequate width as to construct turning
lanes on the initial two-lane divided roadway at internal
resort intersections, as needed.  Widening sections of Alpha
Road . . . would maintain [satisfactory] conditions or
better as major [l]ots in the Turtle Bay Resort are
developed.  The remaining two-lane section of Alpha
Road . . . is expected to operate at a satisfactory [LOS] at
full build out and occupancy of the Turtle Bay Resort Master
Plan.
Addendum No. 3, dated August 25, 2006, analyzed the
second phase of improvements on Kamehameha Highway, including
traffic signalization at the Kamehameha Highway/Alpha Road
intersection, improvements at the intersection of Kamehameha
Highway and Kuilima Drive, and traffic signalization of the
Kamehameha Highway/Kuilima Drive intersection, projected through
2011.  The addendum concluded that
[t]he Kamehameha Highway intersections at Alpha Road and
Kuilima Drive are expected to require traffic signalization
to accommodate the anticipated expansion of Turtle Bay
Resort up to the Year 2011, when a total of 1,970 hotel
rooms will be constructed.  Lane modification at the study
intersections, the extension of Alpha Road from Kuilima
Drive to Marconi Road, and the improvement of Marconi Road
and its intersection with Kamehameha Highway will be
required to mitigate the traffic impacts resulting from the
full-build out and occupancy of Turtle Bay Resort Master
Plan[.]* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

-13-4. The 2005 Subdivision Application
As the ICA further summarized:
On November 8, 2005, Kuilima submitted a Site
Development Division Master Application Form ([s]ubdivision
[a]pplication) to the DPP, seeking subdivision approval for
approximately 744 acres of its 808-acre property.
In response to the [s]ubdivision [a]pplication, the
DPP received two letters in January 2006, asking that the
DPP require the preparation of a [SEIS] before approving the
[s]ubdivision [a]pplication.  In a January 5, 2006 letter,
Eric Gill, the treasurer of UNITE HERE! Local 5, asserted
that a[] SEIS was required because twenty years had passed
since the [1985] EIS and changes had occurred in the
“traffic, water availability, hotel and housing needs,
endangered species habitat needs, and the like.”  North
Shore resident Ben Shafer submitted a January 6, 2006
letter, stating that “[m]uch had changed since the approval
of the [1985] EIS some twenty years ago” and a[] SEIS needed
to be prepared to allow for some community input and to
address new concerns regarding “[t]ransportation, sewage,
housing, water, cultural [issues], [and] the Master Plan for
the Ko#olauloa region.”
The DPP responded to the Shafer and Gill letters
that[,] because no specific time limit had been imposed on
the [p]roject at the time of the [p]roject’s initial
approval, the DPP felt it could not require a[] SEIS to
address changes in the conditions surrounding the [p]roject
caused by the passage of time.  Although DPP planner James
Peirson (Peirson) drafted the January 19, 2006 reply letter
to Shafer, the letter was signed by Eng.  The DPP’s letter
to Shafer stated:
No time frame for development was either implied
or imposed by the City Council as part of its
approval.  Accordingly, the developer is
entitled to proceed with the project as
approved.  By not imposing any time limits at
the time, the City Council indicated that the
project could be developed at its own pace. 
Further, as a matter of law, the [County] cannot
retroactively impose time limits or unilaterally
rescind an entitlement like an approved
discretionary permit.
. . . .
The DPP’s reply letter to Gill, dated January 31,
2006, was prepared by DPP planner Mario Siu-Li (Siu-Li) and
signed by Eng.  The letter explained that a[] SEIS was not
required because[,] as long as Kuilima was following the
appropriate subdivision rules and regulations, the [County]
was obligated to continue to process the [s]ubdivision
[a]pplication.  The DPP provided Gill a copy of its letter
to Shafer.* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-14-[DPP Planner] Peirson explained . . . that[,] when
determining whether to require a[] SEIS, DPP looked to see
if there had been any substantive changes to a project. 
[Planner] Siu-Li similarly stated that the reason why the
DPP did not require a[] SEIS for the [p]roject was because
“the [s]ubdivision [a]pplication was not changing the
existing condition of the properties.”
On March 8, 2006, the [Environmental Council] heard
testimony from members of the North Shore community
regarding the SEIS issue.  On March 22, 2006, the
Environmental Council wrote to the DPP requesting
clarification as to why the [p]roject did not require a[]
SEIS considering “the changes in timing since 1985,
especially with respect to cumulative impacts and mitigative
measures articulated in the original accepted [1985 EIS].” 
In an April 4, 2006 letter, the Department of Corporation
Counsel for [the County] responded that the DPP would not
comment on the Environmental Council’s concerns because the
issue of requiring a[] SEIS had become the subject of
litigation.
The Environmental Council sent a follow-up letter to
the DPP dated June 14, 2006, expressing the [C]ouncil’s
concern that the DPP was placing the burden on others to
prove a[] SEIS was required instead of making its own
independent determination:
The Council is concerned that DPP has not made
an independent determination of whether a[] SEIS
is required.  Rather, it appears as though DPP
believes that it should not require a[] SEIS
unless some third party proves to DPP that it is
required.  This does not appear to be correct.
The Environmental Council also stated that[,] based on the
information available to it regarding changing environmental
conditions in the [p]roject over the last twenty years and
changes in the [p]roject’s timing and scope, it believed the
DPP should require Kuilima to prepare a[] SEIS for the
[p]roject.
As part of its subdivision review process, the DPP
circulated Kuilima’s [s]ubdivision [a]pplication to various
interested departments and agencies of [the County] and the
State of Hawai# i for review, comment, and approval.  The
State of Hawai# i Department of Transportation (DOT) was
among the departments and agencies that reviewed the
[s]ubdivision [a]pplication. The DOT accepted Kuilima’s
[r]oadway [i]mprovements [i]mplementation and [p]hasing
[p]lan after Kuilima agreed to revise its [t]raffic [i]mpact
[a]nalysis report to address the DOT’s concerns.  On
September 29, 2006, without requiring a[] SEIS, the DPP
tentatively approved the [s]ubdivision [a]pplication.* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

B. Circuit Court Proceedings
Two civil lawsuits were originally filed in connection
with DPP’s decision not to require a SEIS for the project: 
(1) Civ. No. 06-1-0265, filed on February 15, 2006, by Unite
Here!, a labor organization representing 350 Kuilima employees,
against Kuilima and the County, seeking to require Kuilima to
prepare a SEIS and to enjoin DPP from processing approvals and
permits for the project; and (2) Civ. No. 06-1-0867, filed on May
19, 2006 and amended on June 7, 2006, by KNSC, a Hawai #i non-
profit corporation comprised of North Shore residents and/or
property owners, and the Hawai #i branch of Sierra Club, a
California non-profit organization, seeking declaratory and
injunctive relief.  Eventually, both actions were consolidated on
July 17, 2006. 
On August 10, 2006, the parties stipulated to dismiss
with prejudice all claims and all parties in Civ. No. 06-1-0265
(the original suit brought by Unite Here!), pursuant to Hawai #i
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 41(a)(1)(B) (2006).  Thus,
the only remaining claims and parties are those brought under
Civ. No. 06-1-0867, KNSC, et al. v. City & County of Honolulu, et
al. [hereinafter, the KNSC/Sierra Club action or the instant
action].* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  As observed by the ICA, “the [p]roject was to be developed in three3
phases, with phase I starting in 1986, phase II starting between 1988 and
1989, and phase III starting between 1993 and 1996[,]” Unite Here!, 120
Hawai#i at 460, 209 P.3d at 1274, and that “the last phase [was] to be
completed before 2000.”  Id.
  Each joinder noted that the County “[did] not join in . . . the facts4
contained in said  . . . [m]otion[s] . . . [to the extent that such facts]
constitute legal conclusion(s), argument or otherwise attempt to characterize
the actions taken by the [County] with regard to the issuance of land use
approvals/permits.” 
-16-In the KNSC/Sierra Club action, the plaintiffs sought
(1) an injunction requiring Kuilima to prepare a SEIS pursuant to
HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27 and (2) to enjoin construction
relating to the project until the SEIS was completed.  Relying on
the description in the 1985 EIS with respect to the timing of the
project,3 the plaintiffs essentially argued that “the [p]roject
has changed ‘substantively in timing, among other things,’” and
that this “change in timing has had a significant effect” such
that a SEIS is warranted.  On June 16, and June 19, 2006, Kuilima
and the County, respectively, filed an answer to the plaintiffs’
complaint, generally denying the plaintiffs’ allegations.  
On October 11, 2006, Kuilima filed a motion for
judgment on the pleadings and three motions for summary judgment.
The County joined in Kuilima‘s motions, except for Kuilima's
second motion for summary judgment.4  See Unite Here!, 120
Hawai#i at 462, 209 P.3d at 1276.  Additionally, in response to * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  The circuit court focused only upon the third motion and cross-5
motion for summary judgment and, as reported infra, ruled that the remaining
motions were rendered moot by its grant of summary judgment in favor of the
defendants.
-17-the defendants’ third motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs
filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.5 
In their motion for judgment on the pleadings, the
defendants argued, inter alia, that HAR § 11-200-26, et. seq.
exceed[s] the statutory authority of HEPA and/or that
requiring Kuilima to prepare a[] SEIS for the Turtle Bay
expansion project would violate the plain and express
language of HRS § 343-5(g) [(Supp. 2005)], which mandates in
unequivocal terms that “[a] statement that is accepted with
respect to a particular action shall satisfy the
requirements of this chapter and no other statement for that
proposed action shall be required[.]”  
In their first motion for summary judgment, the defendants argued
that the lawsuit was barred by the statute of limitation set
forth in HRS § 343-7 (1993), quoted infra.  In the second motion,
Kuilima argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on the
entirety of the plaintiffs’ complaint because the subdivision
application was “(1) exempt from the environmental review
process[] and (2) non-discretionary in nature and[, thus, could]
not trigger a SEIS.”  Finally, the defendants argued in their
third motion for summary judgment that they were entitled to
summary judgment as a matter of law because, based on the
undisputed facts before the circuit court:
1. [The p]laintiffs have no evidence to show a
“substantive change” in the [p]roject as required by
HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27;
2. [The p]laintiffs have no evidence to show “significant
effects” on the environment likely “resulting from”
their alleged change in the [p]roject (timing) as
required by HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27;* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai #i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-18-3. [The p]laintiffs have no evidence to show that any of
the alleged environmental impacts of the [p]roject
that they allege resulted from a change in timing of
the [p]roject were not originally disclosed or
previously dealt with, as required by HAR §§ 11-200-26
and 11-200-27; and
4. Applying the “rule of reason” to DPP’s decision, and
considering the agency’s extensive record regarding
the planning and permitting process for the region in
general, and for this [p]roject in particular, the
DPP’s decision not to require a[] SEIS for the
[p]roject cannot be deemed either arbitrary or
capricious.
The plaintiffs argued in their cross-motion for summary
judgment that:  (1) enforceable HEPA rules required a SEIS either
when there are substantive project changes or  new circumstances
and evidence (emphases added); (2) the substantive change in the
timing of the project caused, and new circumstances and evidence
brought to light, increased environmental impacts to traffic and
species not previously dealt with in the 1985 EIS; (3) Kuilima’s
subdivision application triggered HEPA’s supplemental review; and
(4) DPP did not take a hard look at the new circumstances and
evidence and, thus, violated HEPA when it decided that Kuilima
was not required to prepare a SEIS.  With respect to timing, the
plaintiffs specifically argued that “the passage of time,
especially when it is more than twenty years, is relevant and
must be considered in light of the very low threshold for
requiring a[] SEIS under Hawai #i law.”  On November 3, 2006, the
defendants each filed a memorandum in opposition to the
plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment. * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai #i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  HRCP 56(e) states, in relevant part, that:6
-19-Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on
personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be
admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that
the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated
therein.  Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts
thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached
thereto or served therewith.  The court may permit
affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions,
answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits.  When a
motion for summary judgment is made and supported as
provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon
the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party’s
pleading, but the adverse party’s response, by affidavits or
as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific
facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If
the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if
appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.1. Defendants’ Evidence in Support of Third Motion
 In support of the third motion for summary judgment,
the defendants, pursuant to HRCP 56(e) (2006),6 attached parts of
the 1985 EIS and the KDC unilateral agreement.  With respect to
the 1985 EIS, the defendants pointed to the following specific
language contained therein, which stated:
D.  PHASING AND TIMING OF THE ACTION
    Figure 9 shows the approximate phasing of development
for the resort (phasing is dependent on receiving the
necessary governmental approvals).  Note that Phase I
designation generally indicates a 1986 start of construction
date, Phase II, commencement between 1988 to 1989, and Phase
III, [c]ommencement between 1993 to 1996.
With respect to the unilateral agreement, the defendants pointed
to a provision therein, which stated in relevant part:
3. Development of the project shall generally be based on
the submitted schedule [(which is the same as the one
referenced in the 1985 EIS.]  Development may deviate from
this schedule due to the occurrence of changed economic
conditions, lawsuits, strikes or other unforseen [sic]
circumstances.  * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-20-2. Plaintiffs’ Evidence  in Support of Cross-Motion
The following relevant evidence was submitted by the
plaintiffs in support of their cross-motion for summary judgment,
pursuant to HRCP 56(e):
a.  the 1985 EIS
Relying on the same provision from the 1985 EIS cited
by the defendants, i.e., “D. PHASING AND TIMING OF THE ACTION,”
quoted above, the plaintiffs argued that the timing condition was
inherent within the 1985 EIS itself.  Additionally, the
plaintiffs maintained that the entirety of the 1985 EIS was based
on evidence available in 1985 -- over twenty years ago.
b. DPP’s SEIS procedures
Regarding DPP’s SEIS procedures, the plaintiffs
submitted the depositions of (1) Arthur Challacombe, “the person
designated by the [County] as the most knowledgeable on the
obligations of the County[‘s] DPP to enforce the State of
[Hawaii’s] environmental rules and regulations,” (2) Mario Siu-
Li, DPP’s senior planner, and (3) James Peirson, another DPP
planner.  With respect to how DPP obtains its evidence to aid in
determining whether to require a SEIS, Challacombe stated that,
“if there’s evidence submitted to [DPP,] we will review the
evidence.  If . . . we have no evidence, then we have nothing to
. . . base a determination on.”  Challacombe noted that there
must be some sort of development trigger, i.e., “if . . . the
condition of the SMP called for X . . . units and the building* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai #i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-21-permit application doubles that, . . . that would cause concern
and give us evidence that we need to look at further.”  He
further emphasized that, “if everything’s the same, if nothing’s
changed, then we have no evidence and no need to require or ask
for a [SEIS].”  Siu-Li similarly testified that “normally the
inquiry [DPP] make[s]” is whether “the project conforms to the
approved permit.”  According to Peirson, who drafted the response
letter on behalf of Eng to Shafer, one of the concerned citizens
requesting a SEIS: 
[E]very time a permit comes in, it isn’t a standard question
that needs to be asked, hmm, does a [SEIS] have to be done.
We will examine the impacts associated with the
request, determine what agencies that have expertise in --
certain matters need to review it to let us know whether
there’s issues that we need to be concerned about that might
have changed or things that might be necessary or impacts
that need to be mitigated. 
And when we get that kind of feedback, then we have an
opportunity to . . . take action, for instance, such as
requiring a [SEIS] or requiring additional studies or
reports and things like that.
With regard to the DPP’s process to determine whether
to require supplemental review, Challacombe testified:
Q.  [By the plaintiffs’ counsel] [W]ould[] you look at
the cumulative to see what’s . . . been built around the
subdivision to determine the cumulative impacts of something
before you grant the subdivision application?
A.  [By Challacombe] I would look at the cumulative
impact of the project on the community, not the other way
around.
Q.  Okay, but in doing that, you’d have to know what
the community is at the time, right, you’re looking at?
A.  That’s correct.
Q.  And . . . the DPP wouldn’t have done that unless
somebody came to them with evidence that the community has
changed in some way since the original [permit or
application] was granted . . . ?
A.  I wouldn’t do it. . . .  If the project doesn’t
change, if the project is the same that was what was
approved, then there is no evidence of cumulative impact.
. . . . * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-22-Q.  In your experience, have there been other projects
where the SMP and unilateral agreement had been approved,
but the project wasn’t initiated for another 20 years[.]  
I’m just trying to find out if there’s any limits on this --
. . . I understand this is your opinion, that time is
irrelevant.
A.  Timing is one of the components in . . . the
review.  It is important.  It is not the sole criterion.
Q.  And is it your understanding, though, that then 20
years just by itself is not sufficient to trigger some
thought, gee, maybe things have changed a little bit and we
ought to come investigate?
A.  If the project hasn’t changed, then the project
hasn’t changed so there are no new impacts.
Q.  Unless the surrounding community has changed,
right?  There might be if the surrounding community has
changed, no?
A.  If the surrounding community’s changed, we would
consider that, but we . . . would need the evidence.
Q.  And you would wait for somebody to present
evidence to you, rather than go out and look and see if the
surrounding community has changed?
A.  In terms of the building permit, again, we would
compare.  We would take that into account.  Again, I go back
to the traffic study.  We, I am sure, are going to require
an updated traffic study at the time of building permit
application for the Kuilima development.
A twenty year old traffic study is not sufficient, because 
as you pointed out, there may be factors in the community
that have changed, i.e., traffic.
(Emphases added.)
With respect to the review process in the instant case,
Siu-Li indicated that, in drafting his response to Gill, the
other concerned citizen and an officer of Unite Here!, requesting
a SEIS, his initial assumption was that no SEIS would be
necessary, and, as a result, he relied on the past determination
of a SMP and his colleague’s (Peirson’s) response letter to
Shafer.  He further indicated that he did not go back and review
the 1985 EIS and, thus, was not fully apprised of its contents
nor did he review the original SMP.  Addressing the changes that
have occurred over the twenty years since the 1985 EIS, Siu-Li
testified:* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-23-Q.  [By the plaintiffs’ counsel]  Did you have a
question in your mind . . . before you drafted that letter
[to Gill], whether or not the delay of almost 20 years might
have a significant impact on the environment or surrounding
community?
. . . . 
A.  [By Siu-Li] No, I didn’t.  But like I said, we had
some discussions before drafting the letter, and the
consensus was that the passing of the time by itself alone
would not necessarily trigger a [SEIS].
. . . . 
Q.  [B]efore your letter of January, are you aware of
any consideration given by DPP as to whether or not the
surrounding community had changed in the 20-year period?
A.  Well, you know, everything has changed in 20
years.  I mean, that’s without even saying.  You know,
whether the project itself has changed, that’s something
that has not been shown to us.
(Emphases added.)  Peirson also testified with respect to the
timing of the project as follows:
Q.  [By the plaintiffs’ counsel]  Wasn’t there a
projected phasing [indicated in the 1985 EIS] to be finished
with the project by 1996?
A.  [By Peirson]  There was, I think, one sentence in
the EIS that had a proposed phasing, followed by a footnote
or a second sentence that qualified that phasing.
But what I would explain to you, as a matter of
reading what the entitlement is, there’s a difference
between what an applicant proposes and what the council
disposes in terms of an authority.
If they don’t adopt the phasing as a condition of the
approval, it doesn’t matter what might have been proposed. 
There was no phasing required as a condition of its
approval; and therefore, the passage of time itself could
not constitute a substantive change to the project.
Q.  Could not, you said?
A.  Not under the authority granted by that particular
permit.
Q.  And you don’t believe that it could ever require
another review under Chapter 343?
A.  Are you asking simply because of the passage in
time?
Q.  Let’s start there.  Yes.
A.  No.

-24-c. evidence of “significant changes”
i. traffic studies
The plaintiffs enlisted the services of Tom Brohard, a
professional engineer, and submitted his declaration, as well as
his October 2006 review of traffic studies for the Turtle Bay
resort expansion project on the North Shore of O# ahu.  In his
review, Brohard asserted that “[a]n appropriate traffic impact
analysis of the [project] has not been conducted as of this
date.”  Acknowledging the existence of various documented traffic
studies for the project area -- including those prepared in 1985,
1991, and 2005, discussed supra, -- Brohard opined that such
reports “do not match the EIS project description” and “contain
fundamental errors in methodology.”  He stated that “[t]he 1985
Report is outdated[,] and there are numerous errors, conflicts,
and omissions throughout the 1991 Report and the 2005 Report[.]”
Brohard explained:
The traffic analyses for the [project] have used a lessening
annual background growth rate from 4% in 1985 to 3.5% in
1991 to 2.7% in 2005.  Reducing the background growth rate
is contrary to a number of factors including the significant
increase in the number of vehicle registrations on O# ahu and
increased visitor trips to the North Shore created by
factors such as the increasing popularity of observing
basking sea turtles and the proliferation of surfing schools
catering to tourists.  Each of these has contributed to the
increase in traffic at Turtle Bay, with half of the
overnight Waikiki visitors in 2005 traveling to the North
Shore during their O# ahu stay.
None of the traffic analyses have quantified vehicle trips
generated by “pipeline development” in the study area. 
Certainly, a number of projects have been approved but not
yet constructed or fully occupied.  There are also others
that are “reasonably foreseeable” in the next 15 to 25
years.  Trips to and from “pipeline development” must be * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-25-included in the base traffic volumes before trips for the
[project] are added and analyzed.  
The flawed approach used in each traffic study significantly
underestimates future base volumes.  The revised evaluation
must include vehicle trips from “pipeline development” that
come on line as the major phases of the [project] are
occupied.  All planned and funded road improvements assumed
to be in place at each project phase must also be
identified.
Failing to identify the proper baseline traffic volumes
could certainly result in the failure to disclose
significant traffic impacts when project traffic is added to
the [project].  The future baseline traffic forecasts must
be corrected and each of the resulting significant project
traffic impacts must be identified, analyzed[,] and
mitigated.
ii. monk seals and other species
The plaintiffs submitted a July 5, 2006 report prepared
by marine biologist Jason Baker on behalf of the Pacific Islands
Fisheries Science Center pursuant to the plaintiffs’ June 2006
Freedom of Information Act request.  Baker’s report “summarize[d]
all documented sightings of Hawaiian monk seals in the area of
Turtle Bay resort, between Kawela Bay and Kahuku Point,” as well
as all monk seal births at or near the project site.  Since the
early 1980s, monk seal sightings at and around the project area
were sporadic.  Sightings were reported in 1984 and 1991.  The
record indicates no sightings between 1985 and 1989 nor between
1997 and 1999.  In 2001, monk seal sightings at or around the
project area began to increase, with three sightings in 2001 and
2002, six in 2003, nine in 2004, twenty-one in 2005 and fifty
four in 2006.  According to Baker’s report, “[sixty-nine] of
[the] 101 [documented] seal sightings [since 1984] are
attributable to [eleven] known individual[ seals],” “[f]ive of* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai #i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-26-[which] are adult females who are documented to have given birth
and nursed their pups on remote beaches on Kaua# i, Moloka #i,
Hawai#i, Ni#ihau, Rabbit Island, and O #ahu.”  As of this report: 
[a] single birth has been recorded in [the project] area.  A
pup was born on Kaihalulu Beach, on the Kahuku side of the
resort, on June 1, 2006, and the mother and nursing pup are
currently in the area as of July 3, 2006, along the beach or
in nearshore waters.  The nursing period generally lasts
[five to seven] weeks.  Although not in the immediate area
of interest, a second birth was documented at nearby
Waiale#e Beach Park on March 15, 1991.
The plaintiffs also referenced three water quality
reports administered by Kuilima in 1989 that summarized
observations of green sea turtles over periods of five days
during daylight hours only.  These reports indicated that, in
July 1989, no more than three turtles were observed
simultaneously in one time interval.  The October 1989 report
estimated a maximum of nine turtles in the bay during morning
hours.  In December 1989, there was an average of about ten
turtles in the bay during early morning hours and three or four
turtles in the bay during the mid-day and afternoon hours. 
3. Defendants’ Evidence in Opposition to Plaintiffs’
Cross-Motion
In opposition to the plaintiffs’ cross-motion for
summary judgment, the defendants pointed to, inter alia, other
portions of Challacombe’s deposition testimony regarding the
DPP’s SEIS procedures, both in general and specifically as to
Kuilima’s project: * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  Challacombe indicated that the review of a subdivision application7
is the same as the review for a SMP or building permit, etc. 
-27-Q.  [By the plaintiffs’ counsel]  When[,] . . . based
on your understanding, would a [SEIS] be required for a
project that involves a[] SMP[7] or a unilateral agreement?
A.  [By Challacombe]  When the scope of the project
has changed, the size has changed, density.  Whenever
there’s a significant -- as per the [HEPA] rules, whenever
there’s a significant change in the development.
Q.  How about the timing of the development?
A.  That’s a component, but it’s not necessarily the
only thing.  [I]t’s everything.  Again, size, scope, you
know, it could be the timing, but it’s not necessarily. 
Nowhere --
Q.  It could be any one of those, though, right?
A.  It could be, yes.
Q.  That would trigger a [SEIS]?
A.  It could be.  Again, the key wording is
significant impact.  [A] significant impact would result
from the change in the scope, timing, so forth.
Q.  So is that your understanding of the DPP’s view of
this, is that a [SEIS] is not necessary for a project that
has a[] SM[P] or a unilateral agreement unless there will be
a significant impact . . . in some area?
A.  Yes.
Q.  And it’s not may, it’s will?
A.  May.  No, it’s may.
Q.  It’s may?
A.  Yes.  It specifically says that in the rules.
. . . .
Q.  So it’s not necessarily somebody coming in saying
that this will have an impact, it’s somebody looking at it
to say may this have an impact or not, correct?
A.  That’s correct.
(Emphases added.)
4. Plaintiffs’ Reply Evidence in Support of Cross-
Motion
In further support of their cross-motion for summary
judgment, the plaintiffs submitted evidence in their November 8,
2006 reply memorandum, regarding new information about monk seals
in the project area that was not previously available.  
Specifically, the plaintiffs deposed Charles Littnan, Ph.D. (Dr.
Littnan), a marine mammal ecologist who has studied the habitat
requirements, diet, and feeding behavior of the Hawaiian monk* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  According to Dr. Littnan, “[m]onk seals haul out on beaches for8
three reasons:  to rest, molt, and pup.  Although resting seals may haul out
for short periods, molting seals may haul out for a week or more and mother-
pup pairs may occupy a beach for a month or longer.” 
-28-seal for over ten years.  According to Dr. Littnan, both the
beach and near shore areas of the project are now known to be a
foraging habitat to the monk seal population, the beach has been
identified as an important “hauling out habitat,”8 and the first
recorded pupping of Hawaiian monk seals in the project area
occurred on June 1, 2006.  Dr. Littnan stated that “the numerous
recently reported sightings of monk seals in the area suggest
that the beaches and near shore areas of the [p]roject are
critical to the regeneration of the monk seal population” because
there are numerous beaches on [O# ahu] which have had no
reported sightings of monk seals on them, indicating that
some beaches are not attractive to monk seals.  Several seal
species have been shown to have preference for particular
beach characteristics (e.g.[,] slope, exposure to swells,
substrate [sand or rock], proximity to feeding areas), so it
is reasonable to believe monk seals have similar criteria in
their choice of beach.  Further, the fact that multiple
seals have used this area indicates that there is something
that is causing them to select it specifically.
As a result, Dr. Littnan stated that he “expect[s] that the
number of pups born in the main Hawaiian [i]slands will continue
to increase each year for the foreseeable future, and[,] assuming
there are no changes in the conditions of the [r]esort [a]rea, it
is very likely that the monk seals will continue to use the . . .
[a]rea as a habitat for pupping.”  Dr. Littnan further testified
that, although the project area is not currently designated as a
critical habitat, “the last critical habitat assessment for
Hawaiian monk seals was performed prior to the increased presence* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * * 
in West’s Hawai' i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
of monk seals in the [m]ain Hawaiian [i]slands, [and] it cannot
 
be assumed that the [p]roject area will not be so designated in
 the future.” 
5. Circuit Court’s Decision
 
On November 13, 2006, a hearing on the parties’
 
respective motions for summary judgment was held. After
 considering the arguments made and the evidence submitted by the
 parties, the circuit court entered an order on December 5, 2006,
 granting Kuilima’s third motion for summary judgment and the
 County’s joinder and denying the plaintiffs’ cross-motion for
 summary judgment. The circuit court essentially agreed with the
 defendants’ interpretation of HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27 that
 a SEIS is required only when there is a substantive project
 change and determined that, as a matter of law, the timing of the
 project had not substantively changed. As previously noted, the
 circuit court, based upon its grant of summary judgment in favor
 of the defendants, ruled that the defendants’ motion for judgment
 on the pleadings and the other two motions for summary judgment
 were moot. Also, on December 5, 2006, the circuit court entered
 the following relevant findings of fact (FOFs) and conclusions of
 law (COLs):
 
[FOFs]
 
1. [HRS] § 343-5(g) [(Supp. 2005)] provides that an
[EIS] that is accepted with respect to a particular action
shall satisfy the requirements of the chapter and no other
statement for that proposed action shall be required.
2. [HEPA] allows the Environmental Council to draft
rules and regulations to implement HEPA[.]
 
-29­* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West s Hawai »i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-30-3.  An EIS is supposed to be prepared, and
environmental consequences of an action are supposed to be
reviewed, at the earliest possible time.  See HRS
§ 343-5(b).  The [c]ourt finds that this was done with
respect to the [project] in 1985.  The EIS for the [p]roject
was accepted in October 1985, and is a matter of public
record.
4.  Although there has been some delay in the
[p]roject from the community s perspective, there have been
ongoing activities and actions with respect to the [p]roject
throughout the past [twenty] years.  In addition, the
[p]roject was adopted as part of the Ko» olauloa Sustainable
Communities Plan in May of 1999; the public had an
opportunity to participate with respect to the adoption of
that [p]lan.
5.  The [DPP], as the accepting authority, is
responsible for determining whether a [SEIS] is required for
the [p]roject.  See  HAR §[] 11-200-27.
6.  At the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006, certain
North Shore neighborhood boards . . . and other individuals
asked the DPP whether the timing of the [p]roject would
require a [SEIS].  The [p]laintiffs did not write any of
those letters.  The DPP responded, indicating that it had
determined that a [SEIS] was not required for the [p]roject. 
Although it does not appear that specific reasons were
given, the DPP determined that the timing of the action has
not changed so as to require a [SEIS].
7.  The . . . 1985 EIS contained only general
statements in terms of phasing of the [p]roject, but those
statements did not impose a time limit on the [p]roject
based on that proposed phasing time frame.  The . . . 1985
EIS does not obligate Kuilima to follow that phasing time
frame.
8.  The law provides that when you have a project that
is to be constructed in phases, the original EIS covers
everything, and the project is the action under
consideration.  In this case, the [p]roject is the  action.  
There has been no change to the action that would
essentially make it a new action under consideration.

On June 4, 2007, the circuit court entered its amended
final judgment9 in favor of the defendants and against the
plaintiffs on all of the plaintiffs’ claims set forth in their
first amended complaint.  The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of
appeal on June 19, 2007. 
C.  Appeal Before the ICA
On direct appeal, the plaintiffs contended that the
circuit court erred in (1) granting the defendants’ third motion
for summary judgment and (2) denying the plaintiffs’ cross-motion
for summary judgment.  The plaintiffs argued, as they did before
the circuit court, that a SEIS is required in this case because
the timing of the project has substantially changed. 
Specifically, they argued that “the 1985 EIS and 1985 [t]raffic
[r]eport [we]re ‘outdated’ and ‘[could not] be relied upon to
properly disclose, analyze, and mitigate the significant local
and regional . . . impacts of the [project].”  More specifically,
the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that they were entitled to
judgment as a matter of law because “HEPA applie[d] to* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

plaintiffs’ position.
-32-[Kuilima]’s application for a preliminary subdivision,” and,
thus, DPP had “an obligation, implied in HEPA and express in [HAR
§§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27]” to make an “‘independent
determination’ whether new circumstances and evidence require[d]
a SEIS.”  The plaintiffs additionally contended that, inasmuch as
the DPP did not take a “hard look” at whether “new circumstances
or evidence have brought to light different or likely increased
environmental impacts [from the project] not previously dealt
with,” its decision was not in accordance with the “rule of
reason,” i.e., it was arbitrary and capricious.10
In response, the defendants argued that a SEIS was not
required for the project because “[the] plaintiffs
misinterpret[ed] and misappl[ied] the SEIS rules[] and have not
met their burden” of showing a substantive change in the project
itself.”  Additionally, Kuilima argued that, in any event:  (1)
“[the] plaintiffs’ claims [were] time-barred under HRS § 343-7,”
quoted infra; (2) the Environmental Council exceeded its
statutory authority in promulgating HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-
27 and, “accordingly[,] no cause of action exist[ed] to require
Kuilima to prepare a[] SEIS”; (3) Kuilima’s subdivision
application was not an “‘action’ under HEPA” and, thus, did not
“trigger [DPP’s] obligation to determine if a[] SEIS should be* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

  The County appears to have abandoned these arguments on appeal.11
  HAR § 11-200-26 states:12
 
A statement that is accepted with respect to a particular
action is usually qualified by the size, scope, location,
intensity, use, and timing of the action, among other
things.  A statement that is accepted with respect to a
particular action shall satisfy the requirements of this
chapter and no other statement for that proposed action
shall be required, to the extent that the action has not
changed substantively in size, scope, intensity, use,
location or timing, among other things.  If there is any
change in any of these characteristics which may have a
significant effect, the original statement that was changed
shall no longer be valid because an essentially different
action would be under consideration and a supplemental
statement shall be prepared and reviewed as provided by this
chapter.  As long is there is no change in a proposed action
resulting in individual or cumulative impacts not originally
disclosed, the statement associated with that action shall
be deemed to comply with this chapter.
(Emphases added.)
-33-required.”11  Finally, the defendants contended that DPP did, in
fact, take a “hard look” at the project and, thus, its decision
was not arbitrary and capricious. 
1. The ICA Majority
The ICA issued its published opinion on May 22, 2009,
and, as discussed more fully infra, a majority of the court
concluded that, pursuant to HAR § 11-200-26,12 “the DPP is
required to conduct a two-step inquiry to determine whether a[]
SEIS is required,” Unite Here!, 120 Hawai #i at 465, 209 P.3d at
1279, specifically:
(1) Whether the action (the [p]roject) has changed
substantively in size, scope, intensity, use, location 
or timing?  And if so,
(2) Will the change in any of these characteristics likely 
have a significant effect and result in individual or
cumulative impacts not originally disclosed in the
EIS?* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-34-Id. (emphases in original).  With respect to the two-part
inquiry, the ICA reasoned that:
If the DPP answers the first question in the negative, no
further inquiry is necessary as “no other statement [for the
[p]roject] will be required.”  If the DPP answers the first
question in the affirmative (i.e., finding there is a
substantive change in one of the aforementioned
characteristics), then the DPP is required to determine
whether the change will likely have a “significant effect”
and result in “individual or cumulative impacts not
originally disclosed” in the original EIS.
Id. (citations omitted) (some brackets in original).  In other
words, the ICA majority determined that “there must be a
substantive change in the action (the [p]roject) before a[] SEIS
is to be considered.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  The ICA
concluded that:  (1) “[t]he [1985 EIS] detailed only an
‘approximate phasing of the development for the resort[,]’” id.
at 466, 209 P.3d at 1280; (2) “[n]either the [1985] EIS nor the
governmental entities imposed a timing condition[,]” id.; and
(3) “there was no substantial change in the [p]roject.”  Id.  The
ICA also concluded that a SEIS was not required because the
subdivision application did not constitute an “action” under HEPA
and that, therefore, the 1985 EIS “covered the entire [p]roject,
including the [s]ubdivision [a]pplication.”  Id. at 467, 209 P.3d
at 1281.  Consequently, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s
amended final judgment in favor of the defendants.  Id.  The ICA
did not specifically address Kuilima’s contentions that the
plaintiffs’ claims were time-barred under HRS § 343-7 or that
subdivision application was exempt from HEPA; nor did it review
the defendants’ contention that the Environmental Council* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

office for publication in the periodic bulletin.  Proposing
agencies or applicants shall prepare for public review
supplemental statements whenever the proposed action for
which a statement was accepted has been modified to the
extent that new or different environmental impacts are
anticipated.  A supplemental statement shall be warranted
when the scope of an action has been substantially
increased, when the intensity of environmental impacts will
be increased, when the mitigating measures originally
planned are not to be implemented, or where new
circumstances or evidence have brought to light different or
likely increased environmental impacts not previously dealt
with.
(Emphasis added.)
-35-exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating HAR §§ 11-200-26
and 11-200-27. 
2. The ICA Dissent
The dissent agreed with the plaintiffs’ interpretation
of HEPA and HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27,13 concluding that a
SEIS is required
when significant changes to the anticipated environmental
impacts of a proposed action become apparent such that “an
essentially different action” is being proposed. 
Significant changes to the anticipated environmental impacts
of a development project can arise from changes to the
design of the project itself, changes to conditions
surrounding the project, or the discovery of new
information.  In my view, [HEPA and its rules] do not
restrict the responsible agency by only permitting it to
consider changes to a project’s anticipated environmental
impacts when the design of a project itself has changed. 
Rather, in determining whether a[] SEIS is warranted, . . .
the agency is authorized to consider not only the potential
effects of design changes to the project, but whether
changes to the conditions surrounding the project and newly
discovered information may significantly affect the
project’s anticipated environmental impacts.
Id. at 468, 209 P.3d at 1282 (Nakamura, J., dissenting).  The
dissent considered the overriding purpose of HEPA -- i.e., “to* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

concluded that “[a] proposed project can become ‘an essentially
different action’ in terms of its environmental impacts due to
changed circumstances surrounding the project or the discovery of
new information, even if the project’s design has not changed.” 
Id.  The dissent additionally reasoned, as discussed infra, that
“absurd results” would stem from the majority’s interpretation of
HEPA and HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27.  Id. at 472, 209 P.3d at

A.  Summary Judgment
An appellate court “review[s] an award of summary
judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.” 
Yoneda v. Tom, 110 Hawai #i 367, 371, 133 P.3d 796, 800 (2006)
(citation omitted).  Thus, this court reviews the circuit court’s
grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.  Sierra Club v.
Dep’t of Transp., 115 Hawai# i 299, 312, 167 P.3d 292, 305 (2007). 
Moreover,
[s]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties.  The
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party.  In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
Id. at 313, 167 P.3d at 306 (citations omitted).
B.  Statutory Interpretation 
This court has established the following principles for
interpreting a statute:
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai #i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-38-and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists.  And fifth, in construing an ambiguous
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.
Awakuni v. Awana, 115 Hawai# i 126, 133, 165 P.3d 1027, 1034

statutory language must be read “in the context of the entire
statute and construe[d] in a manner consistent with its purpose.” 
Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Castle, 79 Hawai# i 64, 77, 898 P.2d

interpretation of administrative rules.  Allstate Ins. Co. v.

-39-D.  Agency Decisions
The issue of what standard to apply when reviewing an
agency’s decision whether a SEIS is required presents a question
of first impression in this jurisdiction.  This court, however,
has reviewed an agency’s determination whether an EIS satisfies
the applicable statutory requirements  under the “rule of reason”
standard.  See Price v. Obayashi Hawai# i Corp., 81 Hawai# i 171,
182, 914 P.2d 1364, 1375 (1996).  As applied to consideration of
the adequacy of an EIS, this court has stated:
In making such a determination[, a] court is guided by the
“rule of reason,” under which an EIS need not be exhaustive
to the point of discussing all possible details bearing on
the proposed action but will be upheld as adequate if it has
been compiled in good faith and sets forth sufficient
information to enable the decision-maker to consider fully
the environmental factors involved and to make a reasoned
decision after balancing the risks of harm to the
environment against the benefits to be derived from the
proposed action, as well as to make a reasoned choice
between alternatives.

577 P.2d 1116, 1121 (1978) (citation omitted)) (footnote
omitted).
Moreover, this court has recognized that “[a] court is
not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the
environmental consequences of its action.  Rather, the court must
ensure that the agency has taken a ‘hard look’ at environmental
factors,” and, “[i]f the agency has followed the proper
procedures, its action will only be set aside if the court finds
the action to be ‘arbitrary and capricious,’ given the known* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

-40-environmental consequences.”  Id. at 182 n.12, 914 P.2d at 1375
n.12 (relying on federal case law).
III.  DISCUSSION
The plaintiffs primarily contend before this court that
the ICA majority erred in interpreting HEPA and HAR §§ 11-200-26
and 11-200-27 “to mean that an agency may order a supplemental
review only when there has been a substantive change in the
design of a project” and essentially argue that a SEIS is
warranted when the project has changed “substantively in size,
scope, intensity, use, location, or timing.”  HAR § 11-200-26. 
In response, Kuilima raises two threshold issues that must be
addressed prior to reaching the plaintiffs’ contentions, to wit: 
(1) whether the plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred by the
applicable statute of limitations and (2) whether the
Environmental Council exceeded its statutory authority in
promulgating the administrative rules regarding SEISs. 
A.  Statute of Limitations
As previously indicated, the circuit court ruled that
Kuilima’s first motion for summary judgment based on statute of
limitations grounds, which was joined in by the County, was moot
in light of its grant of summary judgment in favor of the
defendants.  Although the statute of limitations ground was
reasserted on appeal before the ICA, neither the ICA majority nor
the dissent addressed this threshold issue.  In response to the
plaintiffs’ application, Kuilima again argues that the* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-41-plaintiffs’ claims are untimely because the plaintiffs’ complaint
was filed more than 120 days after “the [p]roject started or
allegedly ‘restarted’ and when [the plaintiffs] knew or
reasonably should have known of the alleged change in the timing
of the [p]roject or the ‘new circumstances or evidence.’” 
Alternatively, Kuilima argues that the plaintiffs’ claims are
time-barred because:  (1) the plaintiffs filed the complaint more
than thirty days “after [the plaintiffs] had actual knowledge of
the DPP’s determination that a[] SEIS was not required”; and
(2) the plaintiffs filed the complaint “more than sixty days
after [the plaintiffs] had actual knowledge of the DPP’s
determination that a[] SEIS was not required.” 
HEPA does not provide limitation periods for actions
specifically related to supplemental assessments.  However, it
appears undisputed, based on the arguments of the parties, that
the limitation periods applicable to EISs are the same for SEISs. 
Such treatment is seemingly supported by the administrative rules
promulgated to further the purpose of HEPA that generally subject
EISs and SEISs to some of the same procedural requirements.  See
HAR § 11-200-28 (indicating that the contents of a SEIS “shall be
the same as required by this chapter for the EIS”); HAR
§ 11-200-29 (listing certain procedural requirements, including
filing public notices, distribution, and acceptance procedures,
and indicating that such procedures “shall be the same for the
supplemental statement as is prescribed by this chapter for an* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

related requirements for the environmental review process.
-42-EIS”).  Thus, pursuant to HRS § 343-7, the statute of limitations
for actions related to an EIS -- and, consequently, a SEIS -- is
as follows:
(a)  Any judicial proceeding, the subject of which is
the lack of [an environmental] assessment required under
section 343-5,[ Supp. 200516] shall be initiated within one
hundred twenty days of the agency’s decision to carry out or
approve the action, or, if a proposed action is undertaken
without a formal determination by the agency that a
statement is or is not required, a judicial proceeding shall
be instituted within one hundred twenty days after the
proposed action is started. . . .
(b)  Any judicial proceeding, the subject of which is
the determination that a statement is required for a
proposed action, shall be initiated within sixty days after
the public has been informed of such determination pursuant
to [HRS] section 343-3 [(Supp. 2005) (pertaining to public
records and notice)].  Any judicial proceeding, the subject
of which is the determination that a statement is not
required for a proposed action, shall be initiated within
thirty days after the public has been informed of such
determination pursuant to section 343-3. . . .
(c)  Any judicial proceeding, the subject of which is
the acceptance of an [EIS] required under section 343-5,
shall be initiated within sixty days after the public has
been informed pursuant to section 343-3 of the acceptance of
such statement.
(Emphases added.)  Inasmuch as the issue here is the DPP’s
determination that an environmental assessment was not required,
subsection (c) above, relating to judicial proceedings involving
“the acceptance of an EIS,” clearly does not apply.
On the other hand, subsection (b)’s limitation period
applies to those judicial proceedings related to whether a
statement is or is not required and is, thus, seemingly
applicable.  For circumstances where the determination involves a
statement that is not required, as here, judicial proceedings * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  A “negative declaration” or “finding of no significant impact” is17
defined as “a determination by an agency based on an environmental assessment
that a given action . . . does not have a significant effect on the
environment and therefore does not require the preparation of an EIS,” or, as
here, the preparation of a SEIS.  HAR § 11-200-2.  “A negative declaration is
required prior to implementing or approving the action.”  Id.
-43-“shall be initiated within thirty days after the public has been
informed of such determination pursuant to [HRS] section 343-3.” 
HRS § 343-7(b).  HRS § 343-3 provides in relevant part:
(a) All statements, environmental assessments, and
other documents prepared under this chapter shall be made
available for inspection by the public during established
office hours.
(b)  The [OEQC] shall inform the public of notices
filed by agencies [(e.g., the DPP)] of the availability of
environmental assessments for review and comments, of
determinations that statements are required or not required,
of the availability of statements for review and comments,
and of the acceptance or nonacceptance of statements. 
(Emphases added.)  With respect to “notices filed by agencies”
referred to above, HAR §§ 11-200-11.1 (relating to “Notice of
Determination for Draft Environmental Assessments”) and
11-200-11.2 (relating to “Notice of Determination for Final
Environmental Assessments”), which are nearly identical, provide
in relevant part that, 
if the . . . approving agency [(here, the DPP)] anticipates
that the proposed action is not likely to have a significant
effect, it shall issue a notice of determination which shall
be an anticipated negative declaration[17] subject to the
public review provisions of section 11-200-9.1 [(setting
forth procedures for public review and comment in negative
declaration determination situations)].  The . . . approving
agency shall also file such notice with the [OEQC] as early
as possible after the determination is made[.]  * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  Pursuant to HAR § 11-200-3,18
A. The [OEQC] shall inform the public through the
publication of a periodic bulletin of the following:
. . . ;
2. Notices filed by agencies of determinations that
statements are required or not required;
. . . .
C. The bulletin shall be issued on the eighth and twenty-
third days of each month.  All agencies . . .
submitting . . . negative declarations . . . shall
submit such documents or notices to the [OEQC] before
the close of business eight working days prior to the
issue date. . . .
(Emphases added.)
  HRS § 91-2 provides in relevant part:  “(b) No agency rule, order,19
or opinion shall be valid or effective against any person or party, nor may it
be invoked by the agency for any purpose, until it has been published or made
available for public inspection as herein required, except where a person has
actual knowledge thereof.”  (Emphasis added.)
-44-HAR § 11-200-11.1 (emphases added).18  A review of the record
reveals no evidence demonstrating that the DPP filed a notice of
its determination that a SEIS was not required with the OEQC, and
Kuilima fails to identify any such evidence.  Inasmuch as the
requisite notice was not provided, there is no date from which to
measure the thirty day limitation prescribed by HRS § 343-3(b). 
Consequently, we conclude subsection (b) is inapplicable under
these circumstances.  
Kuilima, however, in attempting to convince this court
that subsection (b) applies, essentially contends that the
plaintiffs’ actual knowledge may substitute for the public notice
and argues (in a footnote) that, “[i]n cases where formal
publication does not occur, the statute of limitations runs from
the date of ‘actual knowledge.’”  (Citing HRS § 91-2 (1993).19) 
Specifically, Kuilima points to various instances when “[m]embers* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-45-of KNSC [allegedly] admitted to having ‘actual knowledge,’”
including, inter alia, (1) Shafer’s receipt of DPP’s January 19,
2006 response letter, indicating that a SEIS was not required,
(2) KNSC director Gilbert Riviere’s attendance at the February 9,
2006 Ko#olau Loa Neighborhood Board Meeting when the DPP’s
February 8, 2006 letter was allegedly read aloud, and (3) “at the
very latest,” KNSC members’ attendance at a March 15, 2006 Sunset
Neighborhood Board meeting when Gill allegedly reported DPP’s
response. 
Kuilima’s citation to the general provision set forth
in HRS § 91-2, quoted supra at note 19, and its conclusory
statement that, absent formal publication, the statute of
limitations runs from actual notice is unpersuasive.  As
discussed above, the statute of limitations set forth in HRS
§ 343-7(b) specifically provides that judicial proceedings “shall
be initiated within thirty days after the public has been
informed of such determination pursuant to section 343-3.”  In
turn, section 343-3 mandates the OEQC to inform the public of the
DPP’s negative declaration upon receipt of such notification from
the DPP.  See Chock v. Gov’t Employees Ins. Co., 103 Hawai# i 263,
269, 81 P.3d 1178, 1184 (2003) (recognizing that “where there is
a ‘plainly irreconcilable’ conflict between a general and a
specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific
will be favored”).  Thus, given the plain and unambiguous
statutory language, coupled with the related administrative rules* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-46-discussed above, actual knowledge cannot be “substitute[d] for
public notice.”  Consequently, Kuilima’s argument lacks merit.  
Finally, with respect to HRS § 343-7(a), the period of
limitation begins to run upon “the agency’s decision to carry out
or approve the action,” or, “if a proposed action is undertaken
without a formal determination by the agency that a statement is
or is not required,” then the judicial proceeding must be brought
120 days “after the proposed action is started.”  In the instant
case, although the subdivision application was part of the larger
action (i.e., the project), the specific “action” for statute of
limitation purposes must be deemed to be the date that the
subdivision application was approved as opposed to when the
project itself was originally approved.  Indeed, any other
interpretation would be absurd, especially where -- as here --
the original project was approved over twenty years ago and is
not even near completion.  See County of Hawai #i v. C & J Coupe
Family Ltd. P’ship, 119 Hawai# i 352, 362, 198 P.3d 615, 625
(2008) (recognizing that “[t]he canons of statutory construction
also require this court ‘to construe statutes so as to avoid
absurd results’”) (citation omitted).  
Moreover, HAR § 11-200-2 defines “supplemental
statement” as “an additional environmental impact statement
prepared for an action for which a statement was previously
accepted, but which has since changed substantively in size,
scope, intensity, use, location, or timing, among other things.” * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-47-Thus, the administrative rules promulgated to further the purpose
and intent of HEPA clearly contemplate the possibility of changes
to the original project that may dictate the need for a further
environmental impact assessment, i.e., a SEIS.  Consequently, it
would be absurd to decide statute of limitation issues related to
a determination whether a SEIS is required or not required based
upon the date of the original project or action because common
sense dictates that, in all likelihood, the issue of a
supplemental assessment would not arise within 120 days of
acceptance of the original EIS or the start of the original
project.  If such determinations were based on the original
project, a great majority of, if not all, judicial proceedings
challenging the SEIS process would be dismissed as untimely.  As
indicated above, such a result would be absurd.
Here, DPP tentatively approved Kuilima’s November 8,
2005 subdivision application on September 29, 2006.  Thus, at
minimum, plaintiffs’ complaint was required to be filed within
120 days thereof, or by February 5, 2007.  The plaintiffs’
initial complaint was filed on May 19, 2006 and their first
amended complaint was filed on June 7, 2006, well before the
limitations period even began to run.  Furthermore, even if DPP’s
January 19, 2006 letter to Shafer, indicating that Kuilima was
“entitled to proceed with the project as approved” constitutes
“approval” under this section, the plaintiffs’ initial complaint
(filed May 19, 2006) was still timely, i.e., 120 days from* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-48-January 19, 2006 is May 19, 2006.  Thus, Kuilima’s argument that
the plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the statute of limitations
is without merit. 
B.  Environmental Council’s Authority to Promulgate HEPA Rules
As previously indicated, the ICA majority did not
address Kuilima’s argument that the Environmental Council
exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating HAR §§ 11-200-26
and 11-200-27 and “accordingly[,] no cause of action exist[ed] to
require Kuilima to prepare a[] SEIS.”  However, Kuilima reasserts
such argument before this court. 
Article XI, section 1 of the Hawai #i State Constitution
mandates environmental protection, stating:
For the benefit of present and future generations, the State
and its political subdivisions shall conserve and protect
Hawaii’s natural beauty and all natural resources, including
land, water, air, minerals and energy sources, and shall
promote the development and utilization of these resources
in a manner consistent with their conservation and in
furtherance of the self-sufficiency of the State.
All public natural resources are held in trust by the State
for the benefit of the people.
To facilitate this constitutional mandate, HEPA was enacted in
1974 “to establish a system of environmental review which [would]
ensure that environmental concerns are given appropriate
consideration in decision making along with economic and
technical considerations.”  HRS § 343-1.  In keeping with this
system of environmental review, HEPA requires that an EIS be
prepared “if [an] agency finds that the proposed action may have * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

  The Environmental Council was created in 1970, 1970 Haw. Sess. Laws.20

disciplines, all of whom are appointed by the governor.  HRS § 341-3(c)
(1993). 
-49-a significant effect on the environment.”  HRS § 343-5(b) (Supp.
2005). 
The Environmental Council20 is charged, pursuant to HRS
§ 343-6 (1993), quoted infra, with the task of promulgating rules
to further the purpose of HEPA.  In fulfilling its statutory
responsibility, the Environmental Council promulgated HAR title
11, chapter 200 that sets forth the “system of environmental
review at the state and county levels” which “provide[s] agencies
and persons with procedures, specifications of contents of
environmental assessments and environmental impact statements,
and criteria and definitions of statewide application.”  HAR
§ 11-200-1.
Kuilima argues that the Environmental Council exceeded
its statutory authority in promulgating HAR §§ 11-200-26 and
11-200-27.  More specifically, Kuilima argues that adopting the
plaintiffs’ interpretation of HEPA would “exceed the enabling
legislation of HEPA” by “caus[ing] HAR §§ 11-200-2 [(the
definition section)], 11-200-26, and 11-200-27 to contravene HRS
§ 343-5(g), which states that “[a] statement that is accepted
with respect to a particular action shall satisfy the
requirements of this chapter and no other statement for that* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
  HRS § 343-2 provides in relevant part:21
“Environmental impact statement” or “statement” means an
informational document prepared in compliance with the rules
adopted under section 343-6 [(quoted infra)] and which
discloses the environmental effects of a proposed action,
effects of a proposed action on the economic welfare, social
welfare, and cultural practices of the community and State,
effects of the economic activities arising out of the
proposed action, measures proposed to minimize adverse
effects, and alternatives to the action and their
environmental effects.
The initial statement filed for public review shall be
referred to as the draft statement and shall be
distinguished from the final statement which is the document
that has incorporated the public’s comments and the
responses to those comments.  The final statement is the
document that shall be evaluated for acceptability by the
respective accepting authority.
-50-proposed action shall be required.”  We cannot agree with
Kuilima.  
First, we recognize that HRS § 343-2 (Supp. 2005)
equates the term “statement” with an EIS.21  We also recognize
that section 343-5(g) limits the number of original EISs under
HEPA, but does not specifically proscribe SEISs.
Further, HRS § 343-6 states that:  
(a) After consultation with the affected agencies, the
[Environmental C]ouncil shall adopt, amend, or repeal
necessary rules for the purposes of this chapter in
accordance with chapter 91 [(entitled, “Administrative
Procedure”)] including, but not limited to, rules which
shall:
(1) Prescribe the contents of an [EIS];
(2) Prescribe the procedures whereby a group of
proposed actions may be treated by a single
statement;
(3) Prescribe procedures for the preparation and
contents of an environmental assessment;
(4) Prescribe procedures for the submission,
distribution, review, acceptance or
nonacceptance, and withdrawal of a statement;
(5) Prescribe procedures to appeal the nonacceptance
of a statement to the environmental council;
(6) Establish criteria to determine whether a
statement is acceptable or not;* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-51-(7) Establish procedures whereby specific types of
actions, because they will probably have minimal
or no significant effects on the environment,
are declared exempt from the preparation of an
assessment;
(8) Prescribe procedures for informing the public of
determinations that a statement is either
required or not required, for informing the
public of the availability of draft statements
for review and comments, and for informing the
public of the acceptance or nonacceptance of the
final statement; and
(9) Prescribe the contents of an environmental 
assessment.
(Emphases added).  
The plain language of HRS § 343-6 clearly authorizes
the Environmental Council to promulgate rules that, at minimum,
address the nine categories enumerated therein.  This court has
stated that
[a] public administrative agency possesses only such
rule-making authority as is delegated to it by the state
legislature and may only exercise this power within the
framework of the statute under which it is conferred. 
Administrative rules and regulations which exceed the scope
of the statutory enactment they were devised to implement
are invalid and must be struck down.
Haole v. State, 111 Hawai #i 144, 152, 140 P.3d 377, 385 (2006)
(citations omitted) (brackets in original).  In other words,
an administrative agency can only wield powers
expressly or implicitly granted to it by statute.  However,
it is well established that an administrative agency’s
authority includes those implied powers that are reasonably
necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted.  The
reason for implied powers is that, as a practical matter,
the legislature cannot foresee all the problems incidental
to carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the
agency.
Id. (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).  Here, the rule-
making authority expressly grants to the Environmental Council
the power to promulgate rules regarding EISs.  However, to
further the purpose and intent of HEPA, the Council, as discussed* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-52-supra, clearly contemplated the possibility of changes to the
original project that may dictate the need for a further
environmental impact assessment, i.e., a SEIS.  Thus, the rules
promulgated to address SEISs, including HAR §§ 11-200-26 and
11-200-27, are clearly within the “implied powers that are
reasonably necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted.”
Moreover, the SEIS process established by the
Environmental Council is consistent with HEPA and its objectives
-- i.e., “environmental consciousness is enhanced, cooperation
and coordination are encouraged, and public participation during
the review process benefits all parties involved and society as a
whole,” HRS § 343-1 -- and furthers environmental review. 
Consequently, we hold that the Environmental Council did not
exceed its authority in promulgating rules to guide the SEIS
process, including HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27. 
C.  Requirement that Kuilima Complete a SEIS
With respect to the plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the
timing of the project, the ICA stated that: 
Plaintiffs’ only allegation in the circuit court of a
“change” in the [p]roject was an alleged change in “timing.” 
Plaintiffs argue that increased traffic, other planned
developments near the [p]roject, and the existence of
endangered or threatened species constitute “new
circumstances or evidence.”  However, these are not
substantive changes in the [p]roject.
When asked what information they had about changes in
the [p]roject, each of [p]laintiffs’ deposition witnesses
admitted they had no personal knowledge or evidence of
changes in the [p]roject, with the exception of their claim
regarding timing.  * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-53-Unite Here!, 120 Hawai# i at 466, 209 P.3d at 1280 (emphasis
added).  The ICA went on to determine that “[t]he [1985] EIS
detailed only an ‘approximate phasing of the development for the
resort[,]’” and that “[n]either the [1985] EIS nor the
governmental entities imposed a timing condition” and ultimately
concluded that “[t]he record in this case demonstrates there was
no substantial change in the [p]roject,” including a change with
respect to timing.  Id.    
The plaintiffs argue before this court that, because: 
(1) “[t]he EIS’s impact analysis relied on basic assumptions
about the project’s timing by incorporating construction
projections in three phases” and (2) twenty-four years have
passed since the 1985 EIS was approved, there has been a change
in the project’s timing such that there is “an essentially
different action . . . under consideration.”  HAR § 11-200-26. 
In its response, Kuilima contends that a different action is not
under consideration because “the [p]roject . . . was not
qualified by timing” inasmuch as “[t]he phasing plan for the
[p]roject contemplated only a general and approximate plan for
development” and “the [u]nilateral [a]greement . . . contemplated
a reasonable and flexible schedule.”  Further, Kuilima argues
that, “[e]ven if this [c]ourt concludes that [plaintiffs] have
shown a ‘change in the timing of the [p]roject,’ the [plaintiffs]
have failed to connect any new or different ‘significant effect* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-54-resulting from’ that alleged change that was not originally
disclosed or previously dealt with” in the 1985 EIS. 
HAR § 11-200-26 states that:
A statement that is accepted with respect to a particular
action is usually qualified by the size, scope, location,
intensity, use, and timing of the action, among other
things.  A statement that is accepted with respect to a
particular action shall satisfy the requirements of this
chapter and no other statement for that proposed action
shall be required, to the extent that the action has not
changed substantively in size, scope, intensity, use,
location, or timing, among other things.  If there is any
change in any of these characteristics which may have a
significant effect, the original statement that was changed
shall no longer be valid because an essentially different
action would be under consideration and a supplemental
statement shall be prepared and reviewed as provided by this
chapter.  As long as there is not change in a proposed
action resulting in individual or cumulative impacts not
originally disclosed, the statement associated with that
action shall be deemed to comply with this chapter.
(Emphases added).  This court has stated that “[t]he fundamental
starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of
the statute itself. . . .  [W]here the statutory language is
plain and unambiguous, [the court’s] sole duty is to give effect
to its plain and obvious meaning.”  Awakuni, 115 Hawai #i at 133,
165 P.3d at 1034.  The same general principles that apply to
statutory interpretation also apply to interpretation of
administrative rules.  Allstate Ins. Co., 105 Hawai# i at 454, 99
P.3d at 105.
Based on the plain language of subsection 26, every EIS
is inherently “qualified,” or limited, by, inter alia, “the
timing of the action,” i.e., some sort of time frame.  As the
plaintiffs recognized, failing to consider the timing of a
project, among other things,* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-55-guts environmental review because certainly no one would
argue that . . . we don’t know how big this project is going
to be, we don’t know how much density there’s going to be on
this project, we don’t know exactly where on the property
this project is going to be located.  All of those things
need to be set out [i]n an EIS.
We agree.  For an EIS to meet its intended purpose, it must
assess a particular project at a given location based on an
explicit or implicit time frame. 
Here, the 1985 EIS explicitly described the scope of
the project and centered its analysis on the size, location,
intensity, and use of Kuilima’s expansion.  The 1985 EIS also
specifically referenced the “phasing and timing of the action,”
stating that the “Phase I designation generally indicates a 1986
start of construction date, Phase II, commencement between 1988
to 1989, and Phase III, [c]ommencement between 1993 to 1996.” 
Although the phasing projections were “flexible,” such
projections indicate that the 1985 EIS was subject to an implied
timing condition or time frame, especially in light of the plain
language of HAR § 11-200-26 identifying timing as a
consideration.
The record in the instant case indicates that the EIS
was based on and limited to data available in 1985 and projected
through 2000.  As a result, the 1985 EIS addressed only the
environmental impacts of the project within that time frame.  For
example, the evidence in the record indicates that:  (1) traffic
studies analyzed traffic impact projections through 2000;
(2) visitor units, hotel demand, and population growth were also* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

common understanding, broadly defined as of such nature or so circumstantial

occurring than not.”  Kepo# o, 106 Hawai# i at 289 n.31, 103 P.2d at 958 n.31.
-56-projected and analyzed only through 2000; and (3) monk seal
populations were nearly non-existent in the project area at the
time and, thus, were not even considered in the 1985 EIS.  
Inasmuch as:  (1) over twenty years have passed since
the approval of the 1985 EIS; (2) the evidence demonstrates that
environmental impacts were examined only through 2000; and
(3) the project is not yet completed, we conclude that the
project, although unchanged in terms of size, scope, location,
intensity, and use, is -- due to the change in timing -- an
“essentially different action,” HAR § 11-200-26, thereby
rendering “the original statement . . . no longer . . . valid.” 
Id.  Consequently, contrary to the ICA-majority’s opinion, a SEIS
may be required and, thus, next examine whether a change in
timing “may have a significant effect.”  See HAR § 11-200-26.  
This court has recently stated that the phrase “may
have a significant effect” as used in HEPA means “whether the
proposed action will ‘likely’ have a significant effect on the
environment.”  Kepo #o v. Kane, 106 Hawai #i 270, 289, 103 P.3d 939,
958 (2005) (construing HRS § 343-5(c)).22  Further, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that,
under the aforementioned standard, plaintiffs “need not show that
significant effects will in fact occur” but instead need only* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

-57-“raise[] substantial questions whether a project may have a
significant effect[ ].”  Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Boody,
468 F.3d 549, 562 (9th Cir. 2006) (underscored emphasis in
original) (bold emphasis added).  
The record in this case -- particularly the post-1985
EIS traffic reports -- clearly “raises substantial questions,”
id., regarding changes in the project area and its impact on the
surrounding communities.  As previously indicated, Challacombe,
the County’s “most knowledgeable” expert with respect to its
obligations to enforce HEPA, testified that timing, although not
the sole criterion, is an “important” component in the County’s
permit review and concurrent determination of whether a SEIS is
required.  According to Challacombe, “[i]f the surrounding
community’s changed, we would consider that[.]”  He also
testified that he was “sure” the County would “require an updated
traffic study at the time of building permit application for the
Kuilima development” and that “[a] twenty year old traffic study
is not sufficient, because . . . there may be factors in the
community that have changed, i.e., traffic.” 
The record suggests that traffic impacts have, indeed,
changed since 1985.  New evidence documenting changes in traffic
patterns in the area have been presented in the form of seven
post-1985-EIS traffic studies and reports, including, inter alia: 
(1) the 1991 traffic report; (2) DOT’s traffic counts taken on
Kamehameha Highway fronting the resort in August 2000; (3) the* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-58-2005 Laniakea traffic report; (4) Kuilima’s 2005 traffic report;
and (5) Kuilima’s 2006 Addendum Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the 2005
traffic report.  Based on the description of these reports
discussed in section I.A.3., supra, it appears that the Kuilima
expansion project will result in traffic impacts that were not
contemplated by the 1985 EIS, which predicted impacts only
through the year 2000.  In other words, all of the post-1985 EIS
traffic studies and report suggest that changes have occurred
since 1985.  The 1985 EIS indicated, for example, that, “[w]hile
the increased traffic generated by the proposed resort expansion
is significant when compared to the projected background
conditions, it is not beyond the carrying capacity of an
upgraded, high quality two-lane arterial”; however, Addendum
No. 1 predicted in 2006 that, at the project’s full development,
peak hour traffic operations at the intersection of Kamehameha
Highway and Alpha Road “are expected to deteriorate below
satisfactory LOS.”
Moreover, as previously indicated, the 1985 EIS
provided an assessment of the traffic impact to the region, i.e.,
between Haleiwa and Punalu #u and specific traffic data for
certain regional areas.  However, none of the updated traffic
studies involved any regional areas, only impacts upon the areas
fronting the resort and within the resort itself.  Nevertheless,
inasmuch as the entire North Shore area is served by the one two-
lane roadway (namely, Kamehameha Highway), it is reasonable to* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-59-infer that studies showing increased impacts in the local region
would likely impact the regional areas. 
The record also indicates that beaches and near shore
waters within the project area are now used by endangered and
threatened species, specifically the monk seal and green sea
turtle.  The facts indicate that:  (1) the project will likely
result in increased impacts on the monk seal population because
monk seals are vulnerable to harassment by humans and face
increased threats in areas where they are exposed to greater
human contact; (2) the numerous recently reported sightings of
monk seals in the area suggest that the beaches and near shore
areas of the project are significant to the regeneration of the
monk seal population; and (3) because the project is expected to
draw hundreds more people -- many of them tourists who are
unfamiliar with monk seal protection requirements -- the
likelihood of increased impacts on monk seals and their
regeneration is likely.  Moreover, studies conducted after the
1985 EIS was approved have also demonstrated an increase in the
green sea turtle population in the project area. 
As previously indicated, the defendants argue that
there is no “new” evidence that was “not originally disclosed or
previously dealt with in the 1985 EIS.”  However, based on the
foregoing discussion regarding the post-1985 EIS reports and
studies regarding traffic conditions, monk seals, and green sea
turtles, such information clearly qualifies as “new” information* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-60-or circumstances that were “not originally disclosed,” not
previously considered, and could have a substantial effect on the
environment.
Based on the foregoing, we believe the plaintiffs have
clearly presented “new” evidence that was not considered at the
time the 1985 EIS was prepared and could likely have a
significant impact on the environment.  Kepo #o, 106 Hawai# i at 289
n.31, 103 P.2d at 958 n.31.  Consequently, we hold that the
project constitutes an “essentially different action . . . under
consideration” and, based on the plain language of HAR
§ 11-200-26, “a supplemental statement [should have been]
prepared and reviewed.” 
Any other result would be both absurd and contrary to
public policy in Hawai# i.  With respect to the possible absurd
result, the ICA dissent aptly observed that:
[U]nder Kuilima’s[,] . . . the [County’s, and the
majority’s] interpretation of the applicable rules and
circumstances, because no specific deadline was established
for the project’s completion, the 1985 EIS would remain
valid in perpetuity and no SEIS could ever be required, so
long as no substantive changes to the design of the project
were made.
Unite Here!, 120 Hawai# i at 472, 209 P.3d at 1286 (Nakamura, J.,
dissenting) (emphasis added).  Indeed, ignoring the implicit time
condition dictated by the anticipated life of the project upon
which an original EIS has been based would allow unlimited delays
and, in turn, permit possible resulting negative impacts on the
environment to go unchecked.  In other words, allowing an* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *

  As we explained in Kahana Sunset, HEPA review is more than a mere23
formality; instead it should function
to provide the agency and any concerned member of the public
with the information necessary to evaluate the potential
environmental effects of a proposed action . . . so that the

-61-outdated EIS to “remain valid in perpetuity” directly undermines
HEPA’s purpose.
HRS § 343-1 (setting forth the findings and purpose for
HEPA) states that
[t]he legislature finds that the quality of humanity’s
environment is critical to humanity’s well being, that
humanity’s activities have broad and profound effects upon
the interrelations of all components of the environment, and
that an environmental review process will integrate the
review of environmental concerns with existing planning
processes of the State and counties and alert decision
makers to significant environmental effects which may result
from the implementation of certain actions. . . .
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a
system of environmental review which will ensure that
environmental concerns are given appropriate consideration
in decision making[.]
(Emphases added).  Indeed, this court has repeatedly recognized
the public purpose served by HEPA to “ensure that environmental
concerns are given appropriate consideration in decision making”
such that “environmental consciousness is enhanced, cooperation
and coordination are encouraged, and public participation during
the review process benefits all parties involved and society as a
whole.”  See, e.g., Kahana Sunset Owners Ass’n v. County of Maui,

335 (2007) (referring to HRS § 343-1).  
Kuilima argues that the ICA majority’s interpretation
of HAR §§ 11-200-26 and 11-200-27 “provides a reliable,
consistent process that recognizes and balances the developer’s
interest and the predictability of a project’s entitlements with
environmental considerations.”  More specifically, Kuilima adopts
the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court that “an agency
need not supplement an EIS every time new information comes to
light after the EIS is finalized” and that “[t]o require
otherwise would render agency decision-making intractable.” 
(Quoting Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 373
(1989) (applying federal law)).  The County agrees, arguing that,
“[i]f every change in circumstances could lead to a[] SEIS
challenge, even if only to determine whether such change rendered
the project ‘an essentially different action[,]’[] the land use
approval would be mired in an untenable gridlock.”  However, the
foregoing analysis does not suggest that supplemental
environmental review is required “every time new information
comes to light after [an] EIS is finalized.”  Marsh, 440 U.S. at
373.  To the contrary, the conclusion that a SEIS is warranted is
based on the particular circumstances in this case and on the* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-63-evidence discussed supra.  Thus, the defendants’ arguments are
without merit.
Based on the foregoing, we hold that the circuit court
erred in concluding that, as a matter of law, “[t]he timing of
the [p]roject has not substantively, or essentially, changed” and
that, “[i]n the alternative, even if the timing had substantively
changed, which the [circuit c]ourt finds that it has not, such
change is not likely to have a significant effect.” 
Consequently, the ICA majority erred in reaching the same
conclusion. 
D.  DPP’s Review of Kuilima’s Subdivision Application
As previously stated, the ICA, in its majority opinion,
did not address the plaintiffs’ argument that the DPP did not
take a “hard look” at the allegations and evidence presented to
it with respect to Kuilima’s subdivision application.  The
plaintiffs make the same contention before this court, and
essentially argue that the DPP did not follow the requisite
procedure in determining that a SEIS was not required.  In
response, Kuilima argues that the DPP did, in fact, take a “hard
look” at “the alleged ‘intensity of impacts’ and ‘new
circumstances and evidence’” and, as a result, the DPP followed
the requisite procedure and did not act arbitrarily or
capriciously in deciding not to require a SEIS. 
Neither the case law in this jurisdiction nor HEPA
itself offers guidance as to which standard of review should* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-64-apply to an agency decision regarding a SEIS.  However, this
court has reviewed an agency’s decision whether an EIS satisfies
the statutory requirements under the “rule of reason” standard. 
See Price, 81 Hawai #i at 182, 914 P.2d at 1375.  As applied to
considerations of the adequacy of an EIS, this court has stated
that:
In making such a determination the court is guided by the
“rule of reason,” under which an EIS need not be exhaustive
to the point of discussing all possible details bearing on
the proposed action but will be upheld as adequate if it has
been compiled in good faith and sets forth sufficient
information to enable the decision-maker to consider fully
the environmental factors involved and to make a reasoned
decision after balancing the risks of harm to the
environment against the benefits to be derived from the
proposed action, as well as to make a reasoned choice
between alternatives.
Price, 81 Hawai #i at 182, 914 P.2d at 1375 (quoting Life of the
Land, 59 Haw. at 164-65, 577 P.2d at 1121 (citation omitted))
(footnote omitted).  Moreover, we have recognized that
a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the
agency as to the environmental consequences of its action. 
Rather, the court must ensure that the agency has taken a
“hard look” at environmental factors.  
If the agency has followed the proper procedures, its
action will only be set aside if the court finds the action
to be “arbitrary and capricious,” given the known
environmental consequences.  
Id. at 182 n.12, 914 P.2d at 1375 n.12 (citing Stop H-3 Ass’n v.
Lewis, 538 F. Supp. 149, 159 (D. Haw. 1982)) (emphases added). 
Inasmuch as this court has applied the “rule of reason” and
“arbitrary and capricious” standards of review with respect to
EISs and agency decisions relating to environmental consequences,
we extend such standard of review to cases involving an agency’s
decision with regard to SEISs. * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * *
in West’s Hawai# i Reports and the Pacific Reporter
-65-As previously mentioned, in assessing Kuilima’s
subdivision application to determine whether to require a SEIS,
the DPP’s rationale was that the phasing or timing of the project
was irrelevant, and, thus, it looked for changes only within the
project itself.  However, evidence in the record indicated that
there was, indeed, a substantive change in the timing of the
project such that an “essentially different action” was under
consideration, HAR § 11-200-26, thereby rendering the “original
statement . . . no longer . . . valid,” id., and, thus, dictating
the need for a SEIS.  The DPP ignored the most obvious fact that
the 1985 EIS was based on detailed information current as of
1985, i.e., that the conditions upon which the 1985 EIS was based
were over twenty years old.  For the DPP to assume that
conditions would not have changed over twenty years is
unreasonable, especially given the “new” evidence with respect to
traffic, monk seals, and green sea turtles, discussed supra. 
Thus, it cannot be said that “the agency has taken a ‘hard look’
at [the] environmental factors.”  Given the unreasonable and
seemingly cursory consideration of whether a SEIS was warranted,
we hold that the DPP’s decision that one was not required was
“arbitrary and capricious.”
