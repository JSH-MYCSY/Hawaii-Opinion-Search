'I
 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STEVEN B. JOHNSON, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 08-053-8696)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon further consideration of this court’s December 8, 
2010 order in 
ODC v. Johnson, No. 28686, disbarring Respondent 
Steven B. Johnson upon entry of the order, the record, and 
Johnson’s recent application to sit for the Hawai' i bar exam, it 
appears the terms of the December 8, 2010 order require Respondent Johnson to “apply for, take, and pass the Hawai' i Bar 
Examination before a reinstatement petition will be considered.” It further appears Rule 1.3(b)(5) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH) forbids an attorney from 
sitting for the bar exam “during any period in which the applicant is suspended or disbarred . . . .” The terms of the
 
December 8, 2010 order of this court and RSCH Rule 1.3(b)(5)
 therefore effectively operate to prevent Respondent Johnson from
 applying for reinstatement, as provided for in RSCH Rule 2.17. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the terms of this court’s 
December 8, 2010 order of disbarment are amended. Pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.17(b)(1), Respondent Johnson may apply for reinstatement as of December 9, 2015 but a successful petition for reinstatement shall not take full effect until, upon granting of the petition, Respondent Johnson applies for, takes, and passes the Hawai' i Bar Examination. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Johnson is
 
reminded that the terms of this court’s November 8, 2007 order of
 reciprocal suspension shall remain in effect, to wit any
 reinstatement to practice in this jurisdiction is contingent upon
 payment of the costs of those reciprocal discipline proceedings
 and full reinstatement to practice law in Oregon.
