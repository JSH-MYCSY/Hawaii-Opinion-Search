CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
(HPD TRAFFIC NO. 1DTC-07-062053)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Petitioner/defendant-appellant Dustin K. Shitanishi
filed a timely application for a writ of certiorari from the
judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed
June 24, 2009, entered pursuant to the ICA’s May 28, 2009 Summary
Disposition Order (SDO), which affirmed the October 2, 2007
judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit (district
court)1 convicting Shitanishi of excessive speeding in violation
of Hawai #i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105 (2007).2  This court 
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In his application, Shitanishi raises the following
 
questions:
 
1.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that
Officer Kobayashi’s testimony regarding the
results of the speed check conducted by Roy’s
Automotive on his speedometer was admissible as
evidence of a regularly conducted activity.
 
2.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that
the admission of the results of the speed check
conducted by Roy’s Automotive on Officer
Kobayashi’s speedometer was not a violation of
Shitanishi’s right of confrontation.
 
3.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding thatOfficer Kobayashi’s testimony regarding theresults of the speed check conducted by Roy’sAutomotive on his speedometer was sufficient toestablish his speedometer’s reliability eventhough the State did not lay the requisitefoundation for admissibility of the speed checkof his speedometer as required by State v.Wallace[, 80 Hawai' i 382, 901 P.2d 695 (1996)]
and State v. Manewa[, 115 Hawai' i 343, 167 P.3d
336 (2007)]. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we conclude that
 Officer Kobayashi’s testimony regarding the results of the speed
 check was inadmissible because the State failed to establish a
 proper foundation to show that the speedometer had been properly
 calibrated and was therefore accurate.

In order for Officer Kobayashi’s testimony regarding
 
the results of the speed check to have been admissible and
 therefore be relied on as substantive fact, the State was
 
3
 Since we agree with Shitanishi’s third argument, and conclude that
the speed check evidence was improperly admitted because the State failed to
establish a proper foundation to show the speedometer had been accurately
calibrated, we do not address his first two arguments.

required to first establish, either through in-court testimony or 
through a properly authenticated business record pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(6): “(1) how and when 
the speed check was performed, including whether it was performed in the manner specified by the manufacturer of the equipment used to perform the check, and (2) the identity and qualifications of the person performing the check, including whether that person had whatever training the manufacturer recommends in order to competently perform it.” State v. Fitzwater, No. 28584, slip op. 
at 57 (Haw. March 3, 2010). This required information is missing from the record here, and therefore the district court erred in admitting the speed check testimony. 
Shitanishi properly preserved his objection to the 
speed check testimony since it was apparent from the context of his initial objection, although phrased in terms of the State’s failure to subpoena the person who performed the test at Roy’s Automotive, that he was objecting to a lack of proper foundation for the speedometer’s accuracy and that the results of the speed check constituted inadmissible hearsay. See State v. Long, 98 
Hawai
'i 348, 353-54, 48 P.3d 595, 600-01 (2002) (pursuant to HRE 
Rule 103(a)(1) a specific objection is not required when the defect is apparent from the context of the objection). Moreover, Shitanishi’s subsequent objections and colloquy with the court made it apparent that Shitanishi was objecting to the State’s

 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
failure to establish a proper foundation for the speedometer’s
 
accuracy. 
We therefore conclude that the speed check evidence
 
should not have been admitted. Absent this evidence, there was
 insufficient evidence to support Shitanishi’s conviction for
 excessive speeding in violation of HRS § 291C-105(a)(1).
 Fitzwater, No. 28584, slip op. at 59-60. Accordingly, we vacate
 the judgments of the ICA and the district court. However, there
 was sufficient evidence to establish that Shitanishi was driving
 his vehicle “at a speed greater than the maximum speed limit” in
 
4
violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1),  a non-criminal traffic
infraction, based on Shitanishi’s admission during his testimony
 that he was driving in excess of the speed limit, as well as the
 testimony of one of his passengers who observed the speed at
 which Shitanishi was traveling. Id. at 61. We therefore remand
 for entry of a judgment that Shitanishi violated HRS § 291C­102(a)(1), in accordance with the applicable statutes governing
 non-criminal traffic infractions. Id. 
Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s June 24, 2009
 
4
 HRS § 291C-102 (2007) states in relevant part:
 
Noncompliance with speed limit prohibited. (a) A
person violates this section if the person drives:
(1)	 A motor vehicle at a speed greater than the
maximum speed limit other than provided in
section 291C-105[.]
 . . . .

judgment on appeal is vacated, the district court’s October 2,
 
2007 judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
 proceedings consistent with this order.
