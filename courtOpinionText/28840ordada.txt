Partners, XIV, LLC and Sunstone Realty Partners, IX, LLC
 
[hereinafter, collectively, Sunstone] petitioned this court to
 review the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) January 25, 2010
 judgment on appeal, entered pursuant to its June 29, 2009
 published opinion. Therein, the ICA affirmed the Circuit Court
 of the Third Circuit’s October 8, 2007 order granting
 respondents/plaintiffs-appellees Kona Village Realty, Inc.,
 Brenda Tschida, and Robert Tschida [hereinafter, collectively,
 
-1­* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * * 
in West’s Hawai� i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
Kona Village]’s motion to confirm arbitration award and denying
 
Sunstone’s motion to vacate or correct the arbitration award. 
Upon careful review of the record and the papers
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s January 25, 2010 
judgment on appeal is affirmed based on the plain language of Hawai
�i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-21(b) (Supp. 2006) and 
public policy, as discussed infra. 
HRS § 658A-21(b) provides that “[a]n arbitrator may
 
award reasonable attorney’s fees and other reasonable expenses of
 arbitration if such an award is authorized by law in a civil
 
action involving the same claim or by the agreement of the
 
parties to the arbitration proceeding.” (Emphases added.) The
 
use of the disjunctive “or” clearly presents two alternatives
 under which an arbitrator is authorized to award attorneys’ fees
 in a Chapter 658A arbitration proceeding, i.e., (1) under the law
 applicable in a civil action involving the same claim or
 (2) pursuant to an agreement of the parties. Thus, the plain
 language of the statute dictates that an examination of both
 possibilities is required.
 
In the case at bar, an award of attorneys’ fees is
 
authorized under both (1) the law applicable in a civil action of
 the same claim and (2) the agreement of the parties. Indeed, the
 law applicable here, i.e., HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 2009), authorizes
 
-2­* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * * 
in West’s Hawai� i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
an award of attorneys’ fees in actions based on assumpsit, but
 
limits the amount of the fees to 25% of the judgment, and the
 existing party-agreement authorizes the arbitrator to award
 attorneys’ fees “in such amounts as the majority of the
 arbitrators shall determine at the time of the award.” Based on
 the specific authorization in the parties’ agreement, the award
 of attorneys’ fees was valid and proper, notwithstanding the 25%
 fee limitation set forth in HRS § 607-14, and is supported by
 express public policy associated with arbitration proceedings.
 
This court has repeatedly recognized the policy that 
arbitration is meant to be “more expeditious and inexpensive” than traditional court processes. See, e.g., Mars Constructors, 
Inc. v. Tropical Enterprises, Ltd., 51 Haw. 332. 334, 460 P.2d 317, 318 (1969) (“It is generally considered that parties resort to arbitration to settle disputes more expeditiously and inexpensively than by a court action[.]”). However, this court has also recognized: (1) the freedom and autonomy of parties to enter into an agreement for arbitration; (2) their right to provide the scope of the arbitrators’ authority within such agreements; and (3) the broad discretion afforded to, and the limited judicial review of, the arbitrator in rendering awards. In other words, “the scope of an arbitrators’ authority is determined by agreement of the parties.” Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 
99 Hawai
�i 226, 235, 54 P.3d 397, 406 (2002); see also, Clawson 
v. Habilitat, Inc., 71 Haw. 76, 78, 783 P.2d 1230, 1231 (1989).

In reviewing arbitration awards, this court has stated:
 
[B]ecause of the legislative policy to encourage arbitration
and thereby discourage litigation, arbitrators have broad
discretion in resolving the dispute. Upon submission of an
issue, the arbitrator has authority to determine the entire
question, including the legal construction of terms of a
contract or lease, as well as the disputed facts. In fact,
where the parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby assume
all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the
risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the
application of law and in their findings of fact.
 
Schmidt v. Pacific Benefit Srvs., Inc., 113 Hawai �i 161, 165-66, 
150 P.3d 810, 814-15 (2006) (citing Daiichi Hawai �i Real Estate 
Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai �i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003)) 
(emphases added). Here, the parties specifically agreed that the
 
arbitrators were authorized to award attorneys’ fees “in such
 amounts as the majority of the arbitrators shall determine at the
 time of the award.” In so doing, the parties assumed the
 “hazards” of the arbitration process, including an award of
 attorneys’ fees greater than that provided by statute. 
HRS Chapter 658A is based upon the Uniform Arbitration
 
Act (UAA) and was examined by the ICA in In re Arbitration
 Between United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, 119 Hawai
�i 
201, 194 P.3d 1163 (App. 2008). Therein, the ICA recognized in
 part that:
 
First, arbitration is a consensual process in which autonomy
of the parties who enter into arbitration agreements should
be given primary consideration, so long as their agreements
conform to notions of fundamental fairness. Second, the
underlying reason many parties choose arbitration is the
relative speed, lower cost, and greater efficiency of the
 process. The law should take these factors, where
applicable, into account. Finally, in most cases[,] parties
intend the decisions of arbitrators to be final with minimal
 court involvement unless there is clear unfairness or a
 denial of justice. This contractual nature of arbitration
 means that the provision to vacate awards in Section 23 [of
 
-4­ 
 * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * * 
in West’s Hawai� i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
the UAA] is limited. This is so even where an arbitrator
 
may award attorneys’ fees, punitive damages or other
exemplary relief under Section 21 [of the UAA]. 
Id. at 210, 194 P.3d at 1172 (citing Prefatory Note, 7 U.L.A.
 
2-3) (emphases added) (ellipses omitted). The recognized
 autonomy of parties to enter into an arbitration agreement (which
 can include a provision regarding attorneys’ fees) is directly
 correlated to and stems from the constitutionally protected right
 of freedom to contract. In recognizing such a right, this court
 has stated:
 
In general, parties may contract as they wish, and courts
will enforce their agreements without passing on their
substance. The principle of freedom of contract is itself
rooted in the notion that it is in the public interest to
recognize that individuals have broad powers to order their
own affairs by making legally enforceable promises. 
City Exp., Inc. v. Express Partners, 87 Hawai �i 466, 470, 959 
P.2d 836, 840 (1998) (citing Restatement of Contracts (Second) 
Introductory Note to Chapter 8 (1979)); see also Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Newtown Meadows ex rel. its Bd. of Dirs. v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai
�i 232, 167 P.3d 225 (2007) 
(recognizing the freedom to contract in the context of recoverable damages for negligence and expressing that “[c]ontracting parties are free to adjust their respective obligations to satisfy their mutual expectations”) (citation omitted)). By its plain and express language that an award of attorneys’ fees can be authorized by agreement of the parties, HRS § 658A-21(b) clearly embodies the policy that parties are 
-5­ * * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * * 
in West’s Hawai� i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
free to enter into arbitration agreements and, in general, govern
 
the applicable terms. 
Furthermore, the UAA’s commentary to Section 21(b) -- a
 
provision identical to HRS § 658A-21(b) -- states:
 
(1) “Section 21(b) authorizes arbitrators to award
reasonable attorneys’ fees and other reasonable expenses of
arbitration where such would be allowed by law in a civil
action” and (2) “in addition, parties may provide for the
remedy of attorneys’ fees and other expenses in their
agreement even if not otherwise authorized by law.” 
Such commentary -- specifically, the provision that attorneys’
 
fees may be agreed upon “even if not otherwise authorized by law”
 
-- confirms that parties can permissibly contract for attorneys’
 
fees that are outside the purview of applicable law. The
 commentary additionally confirms that attorneys’ fees need not be
 authorized by law to be provided for in a party agreement. As
 such, Section 21(b) of the UAA -- like HRS § 658A-21(b) -- also
 embodies the principle that parties have the freedom to contract,
 i.e., they have the right to set forth or provide for fees in an
 arbitration agreement “even if” such remedy is not “otherwise
 authorized” by a provision of law. 
Finally, the existence of statutory language in HRS
 
§ 607-14 that limits the award of attorneys’ fees in court
 actions for assumpsit draws attention to the fact that the
 legislature could have injected similar language into Chapter 658
 generally, or HRS § 658A-21(b) specifically, but declined to do
 so. In other words, the fact that HRS § 607-14 specifically
 limits awards to 25% of the judgment in assumpsit actions and
 
-6­* * *   FOR PUBLICATION   * * * 
in West’s Hawai� i Reports and the Pacific Reporter 
that no such language is included in HRS § 658A-21(b) 
demonstrates that the legislature did not intend a similar limitation on arbitration awards. At the very least, the legislature has not evinced an intent one way or the other with respect to arbitration proceedings that decide actions in assumpsit. As stated by the ICA on direct appeal, “it is not the role of this court to establish a new rule of law mandating a cap on attorneys’ fees awarded in arbitrations. This is a matter for legislative action or the parties’ own agreements.” See Kona 
Village, 121 Hawai
�i 110, 116, 214 P.3d 1100, 1106 (App. 2009). 
Consequently, this court is left with the plain language of the statute and its related commentary from the UAA itself, which, as indicated supra, establish that awards of attorneys’ fees can be valid and authorized based on a party agreement, even if the resulting award exceeds the “25% of the judgment” limitation included in HRS § 607-14.
