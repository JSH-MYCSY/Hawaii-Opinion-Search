CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA AND DUFFY, JJ., AND CIRCUIT JUDGE
PERKINS, ASSIGNED IN PLACE OF MOON, C.J., RECUSED AND RETIRED;
WITH ACOBA, J., CONCURRING SEPARATELY AND DISSENTING
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
In the instant appeal, we consider whether the family
 
court properly denied Geraldine Cvitanovich-Dubie’s (Geraldine)
 
motion for relief from the divorce decree terminating her
 marriage to George Patrick Dubie (George). The motion alleged
 that Geraldine and George were never legally married, and that
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the property settlement agreements attendant to the divorce
 
decree were procured through fraud on the court and undue
 influence. 
Briefly stated, the family court granted Geraldine and 
George’s divorce in a November 28, 2003 Divorce Decree (11/28/03 Decree). George was subsequently shot and killed in Thailand on July 2, 2006. On June 28, 2007, Geraldine filed a motion to vacate the 11/28/03 Decree, or to set aside the corresponding property division, pursuant to Hawai
'i Family Court Rules (HFCR) 
Rule 60(b)(4) and (6), quoted infra. Geraldine argued, inter alia, that her marriage to George was void ab initio because George’s previous marriage had not ended in a valid divorce. Accordingly, Geraldine argued that she and George were not legally married at the time the family court entered the 11/28/03 Decree, and that the 11/28/03 Decree was therefore void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
The Family Court of the First Circuit (family court)
 
1
denied Geraldine’s motion,  and Geraldine appealed.  In an April 12, 2010 published opinion, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) held that quasi-estoppel barred Geraldine’s challenge to the validity of the 11/28/03 Decree. Cvitanovich-
Dubie v. Dubie, 123 Hawai
'i 266, 278-80, 231 P.3d 983, 995-97 
(App. 2010). The ICA further held that Geraldine’s claims of fraud and undue influence were properly considered under HFCR 
1
 The Honorable R. Mark Browning presided.
 
-2­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Rule 60(b)(3), quoted infra, and were untimely because they were
 
not brought within one year of the 11/28/03 Decree. Id. at 281­
82, 231 P.3d at 998-99. Geraldine seeks review of the ICA’s
 May 3, 2010 judgment, affirming the family court’s order denying
 Geraldine’s motion. 
We conclude that the ICA did not err in affirming the 
family court’s order, but that its reasoning was erroneous in part. Specifically, the ICA held that Geraldine was estopped from challenging the validity of George’s prior divorce, and thereby was estopped from challenging the family court’s subject matter jurisdiction to enter the 11/28/03 Decree. Id. at 278-80, 
231 P.3d at 995-97. However, jurisdiction cannot be created by estoppel, cf. Williams v. Aona, 121 Hawai
'i 1, 8, 210 P.3d 501, 
508 (2009) (“The lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived by the parties.”) (citation omitted), and it therefore follows that a party cannot be estopped from challenging the family court’s subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the ICA was required to address whether the 11/28/03 Decree was “void,” as that term is used in HFCR Rule 60(b)(4), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the
 
11/28/03 Decree is not void under HFCR Rule 60(b)(4). We further
 hold that Geraldine’s claims of “fraud on the court” and undue
 influence are properly considered under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), and
 are therefore untimely. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of
 
-3­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the ICA.
 
I. Background
 
The following factual background is taken from the
 
record on appeal. 
A. 11/28/03 Decree
 
Geraldine and George’s certificate of marriage
 
indicates that they were married on May 1, 1996. Geraldine filed
 
a Complaint for Divorce on November 6, 2003, on the ground that
 the marriage between Geraldine and George was irretrievably
 broken. 
Following a hearing, the family court filed the
 
11/28/03 Decree, in which it found “the material allegations of
 the Complaint for Divorce to be true, [Geraldine] is entitled to
 a divorce from the bonds of matrimony . . . and the [family
 c]ourt has jurisdiction to enter this Divorce Decree.” The
 11/28/03 Decree incorporated by reference “the Marital Agreement,
 signed on October 20, 2003, [the] First Amendment to Marital
 Agreement, signed on November 3, 2003, [the] Second Amendment to
 Marital Agreement, signed on November 7, 2003, and [the] Third
 Amendment to Marital Agreement, signed on November 7, 2003”
 (hereinafter collectively “Property Settlement Agreements”). The
 11/28/03 Decree ordered that “[t]he parties are awarded all of
 their separate property,” and that “[a]ll joint property shall be
 divided equally,” except as set forth in the Property Settlement
 Agreements.

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. Rule 60 motion
 
1. Geraldine’s allegations and arguments
 
On June 28, 2007, Geraldine filed a motion to vacate
 
the 11/28/03 Decree, or to set aside the corresponding property
 
2 3
division, pursuant HFCR Rule 60(b)  (Rule 60 motion).
2 Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to Rule 60(b)
refer to the HFCR. HFCR Rule 60(b) provides for relief from a judgment or
order as follows:
 
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud. On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party’s legal representative from any or all of the
provisions of a final judgment, order, or proceeding
for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered
evidence which by due diligence could not have been
discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule
 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is
void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released,
or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is
based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is
no longer equitable that the judgment should have
prospective application; or (6) any other reason
justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and
for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceedings was entered
or taken. For reasons (1) and (3) the averments in the
motion shall be made in compliance with Rule 9(b) of
these rules. A motion under this subdivision (b) does
not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its
operation. This rule does not limit the power of a
court to entertain an independent action to relieve a
party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set
aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.
 
(Emphasis added).

 Geraldine had previously filed a Motion for Substitution of
Parties to Pursue Post Decree Relief, seeking to substitute Nancy Dubie
(Nancy), as Personal Representative of George’s estate, as a defendant. It
 appears that the family court orally granted the substitution during an
October 8, 2007 hearing on Geraldine’s motions, inasmuch as the family court
stated that it was “inclined to grant the motion for substitution[,]” and did
not comment further on that motion. Although no written order was entered on
Geraldine’s motion for substitution, all subsequent filings listed Nancy as
the defendant, and neither party has disputed that the motion for substitution
was granted.
 
-5­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Geraldine’s Rule 60 motion sought relief pursuant to Rule
 
60(b)(4) and Rule 60(b)(6). With regard to Rule 60(b)(4),
 Geraldine argued that the 11/28/03 Decree was void on the ground
 that Geraldine and George were never legally married. 
Alternatively, Geraldine argued that the property division
 portion of the 11/28/03 Decree should be set aside under Rule
 60(b)(6), on the ground that the property division was the result
 of “fraud on the court” and “undue influence.” 
In her Memorandum in Support of Motion, Geraldine 
alleged the following facts in support of her claims. Geraldine asserted that George was legally married to Sylvie Bertin (Sylvie) in Honolulu, Hawai
'i on October 2, 1989. Geraldine 
asserted that Sylvie “purported to obtain a divorce decree in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic” on February 2, 1995 (Dominican Decree).
4 Geraldine asserted that Sylvie was then a resident of 
Montserrat, West Indies, and that George “was not and never had been a resident and/or domiciliary of the Dominican Republic, and did not appear personally or through counsel in any divorce proceedings in the Dominican Republic.” 
Geraldine further asserted that she met George in March
 
1996, and that George “intended to obtain her money and
 property.” Geraldine asserted that George therefore made factual
 
4
 The parties variously refer to the date of the Dominican Decree as
February 2, 1995 or February 7, 1995. It appears that the judgment of the
Dominican court was entered on February 2, 1995, and that a Notice of Judgment
was issued on February 7, 1995. For purposes of this opinion, we consider the
date of the Dominican Decree to be the date of the Dominican court’s judgment,
or February 2, 1995.
 
-6­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
representations to her, including that (1) he was independently
 
wealthy; (2) he had authored numerous screen plays for well-known
 movies; (3) he had serious and/or fatal illnesses and diseases;
 and (4) his uses of her money were to her benefit. Geraldine
 further asserted that George concealed from her “that he had a
 criminal conviction, that there were unsatisfied civil judgments
 against him for more than a million dollars for fraud and undue
 influence, and that he had fathered at least nine children.” 
Geraldine further asserted that, in 2002, George “began
 
spending a considerable amount of time in Thailand,” where he
 obtained “items of value and real property” using Geraldine’s
 money. Geraldine asserted that, in 2003, George advised her that
 “for business and other reasons” they should divorce, but that
 the divorce would be temporary and they should not tell anyone of
 the divorce. 
In support of these factual assertions, Geraldine
 
submitted (1) a copy of George and Sylvie’s marriage certificate;
 (2) certified copies of two separate Judgments, Guilty
 Convictions and Probation Sentences, sentencing “George Dubie” on
 charges of theft in the first degree, to which he pled no
 contest; (3) a copy of a civil judgment against George in the
 amount of $1,705,594.44 in an unrelated civil case; (4) certified
 copies of Geraldine and George’s marriage license application and
 marriage certificate, indicating that Geraldine and George were
 
-7­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5
married on May 1, 1996;  (5) a Variation of Separation Agreement
6
entered into by Sylvie and George in 1996;  (6) a Report of the
Death of an American Citizen Abroad concerning George’s death;
 (7) an Order Granting Petition for Probate of Will and
 Appointment of Personal Representative in P. No. 06-1-0700,
 naming Nancy as Personal Representative of George’s estate; (8)
 Geraldine’s declaration; (9) a declaration, “legal opinion,” and
 supporting materials from an attorney in the Dominican Republic,
 concerning the validity of the Dominican Decree; and (10) a
 declaration of forensic psychologist Bennett Blum, opining that
 the Property Settlement Agreements were a result of George’s
 undue influence on Geraldine. 
In her declaration, Geraldine stated, in pertinent
 
part, as follows:
 
3. In or about March 1996, I met GEORGE [].
From the beginning of our relationship, GEORGE [] made
factual representations to me regarding his financial
worth, his business activities, his children and his
marital status. These included, without limitation,
representations that he was independently wealthy,
that he was the author of numerous screen plays of
well-known Hollywood movies, that he had four
children, and that he was divorced from his previous
wife Sylvie []. GEORGE [] concealed the facts that he
had a criminal conviction, that there were civil
judgments against him, and that he had fathered at
least nine children. 
4. On or about April 30, 1996, a purported
investigator named G. Kalani Long gave me a letter in
 
5
 In the Marriage License Application from the Hawai' i State 
Department of Health, George indicated that his most recent marriage had endedin divorce in September 1995 in the “Dominican Rep., Carribean [sic].” 
6
 The Variation of Separation Agreement, which was filed in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia on October 23, 1996, amended a prior June 9,
1995 Separation Agreement and altered Sylvie and George’s agreement with
regard to custody of their daughter. In the Variation of Separation
Agreement, Sylvie is denominated as “the Wife,” and George is denominated as
“the Husband.” 
-8­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
which he advised me that he had conducted a background
check on GEORGE [] on March 27, 1996; that he had
checked publicly available records in the State of
Hawaii with regard to whether GEORGE [] had a criminal
record and whether there had been civil judgments
entered against him and that the results of the
investigation were that GEORGE [] had no criminal
record and that there were no civil judgments against
him.
 
5. GEORGE [] and I went through a marriage
ceremony on May 1, 1996. From and after that date, I
thought and believed that GEORGE [] and I had been
legally married on May 1, 1996.
6. I relied on the factual representations as
set forth above. Had I known the truth, I would not
have consented to marry GEORGE [].
7. Shortly after my marriage to GEORGE [], he
introduced me to Sylvie [].
8. Beginning around 2002, GEORGE [] began
spending a considerable amount of time in Thailand,
where, on information and belief, he invested in,
purchased, or otherwise obtained items of value and
real property, using money obtained from me. He
 represented to me that each item he purchased or
invested in belonged equally to both of us and that
all uses of and investments of my money created an
ownership interest in my favor and therefore that they
were of benefit to myself and/or would be returned to
 me.
 
9. In 2003, he represented to me that for
business and other reasons, we should obtain a
divorce, but that the divorce would be only temporary,
that we would soon remarry, and that therefore, we
shouldn’t tell others of the divorce and should
 continue to live as we had throughout our marriage. I
 believed him and agreed to do so. GEORGE [] caused me
to agree to transfer real property, personal property
and other things of value to him via contracts, some
of which became incorporated in what purported to be a
decree of divorce issued by the [family court] and
some of which were post-divorce decree transfers.
10. Not until months after GEORGE []’s death
did I become aware that GEORGE [] had not been validly
divorced from Sylvie [] at the time of the May 1, 1996
 ceremony.
11. It was only after GEORGE []’s death in July
of 2006 that I became aware how he had manipulated me
through false statements, false promises, and other
devices and techniques to transfer property (real and
personal) and things of value to him in the course of
our divorce proceedings. But for his manipulations of
me, false statements, false promises and other tactics
employed by him, and my trust in him, I would not have
agreed to these transfers.
 
. . . .
 
In his declaration, forensic psychologist Bennett Blum 
declared in pertinent part as follows:
 
-9­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a. It is my opinion that [Geraldine] was
susceptible to manipulation and undue influence at the
time she met [George] in 1996 due to certain factors
in her background and certain life circumstances
existing at that time.
b. It is my opinion that [Geraldine] expected
honesty and truthfulness from [George]; however, he
engaged in manipulative, deceptive and misleading
behaviors in order to benefit himself. Such behaviors
 included the willful presentation of false information
(“lying”); and withholding relevant information,
presenting partial truths, and/or taking statements
out of context (“paltering”). Through his lying and
paltering, [George] used several manipulative tactics
and created situations commonly employed by cult
leaders, scam artists, and perpetrators of undue
influence.
 
c. Because of [George’s] lies and palters,
[Geraldine] based decisions about him and his requests
upon misleading, inadequate, and/or inaccurate
information. 
d. . . . . [Geraldine] was made to believe that
certain actions were critical to her husband’s health
 and their happiness as a couple. This consideration
 overwhelmed all others, including the input from legal
advisors or accountants.
 
e. It is my opinion that [Geraldine] was
subjected to the psychological and interpersonal
conditions associated with undue influence.
 
f. It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of
medical probability, that all of [Geraldine’s] major
transactions involving [George], including property
transfers, occurred as a result of his manipulation
and use of undue influence tactics. This includes the
 period from their wedding until his death.
 
With regard to Rule 60(b)(4), Geraldine argued that the
 
Dominican Decree was invalid because the Dominican court “lacked
 
jurisdiction.” Alternatively, Geraldine argued that, even if the
 Dominican Decree were valid under the laws of the Dominican
 Republic, it would not be entitled to comity.
7 Accordingly,
 
Geraldine argued that her purported marriage to George was void
 
7
 “Comity” means “[a] practice among political entities (as nations,
states, or courts of different jurisdictions) involving esp. mutual
recognition of legislative, executive, and judicial acts.” Black’s Law
 
Dictionary 303 (9th ed. 2009).
On appeal, the ICA concluded that the Dominican Decree was not
entitled to recognition on the basis of comity. Cvitanovich-Dubie, 123 
Hawai'i at 273-75, 231 P.3d at 990-92. Because neither party has challenged
that conclusion, we do not discuss Geraldine or Nancy’s arguments concerningcomity in further detail. 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ab initio because the Dominican Decree did not terminate George
 
and Sylvie’s marriage, making George and Geraldine’s marriage
 bigamous. Geraldine further argued that, because the family
 court “did not have a ‘lawfully married’ couple before it,” it
 was “without power to enter a divorce decree.” 
Alternatively, Geraldine argued that the family court
 
should set aside the property division portion of the 11/28/03
 Decree pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), on the ground that George
 “exercised undue influence in obtaining the property division,”
 and “because the marriage was bigamous, and because [George]
 committed fraud on the [c]ourt.” With regard to her allegations
 of “fraud on the court,” Geraldine argued that George
 “conceal[ed] the fact that he had never divorced Sylvie [],
 thereby claiming a status and identity (i.e., a married man) to
 gain access to [the family court] so he could use it as a device
 to improperly obtain [Geraldine’s] assets.” 
With regard to her allegations of undue influence,
 
Geraldine asserted that George “was an exceptionally effective
 manipulator . . . . [and] the scale of his deception and the
 techniques he used were extraordinary.” Geraldine asserted that
 the Property Settlement Agreements showed that Geraldine
 transferred “property, money, and other things of value to
 [George] for no consideration, all within an extremely short
 period of time.” Geraldine further asserted that she “understood
 and believed that the divorce was only temporary[,]” and that she
 
-11­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“did not have her guard up because she believed the divorce was
 
on paper only.” Geraldine stated that her assertions would be
 supported “when testimony is taken and exhibits introduced,” and
 that “all the particular ways in which the division was so
 inequitable . . . will be shown in detail at the evidentiary
 hearing.” However, Geraldine did not specifically request an
 evidentiary hearing in her Rule 60 motion or her Memorandum in
 Support of Motion. 
2. Nancy’s Memorandum in Opposition
 
In her Memorandum in Opposition to Geraldine’s Rule 60 
motion, Nancy, as Personal Representative of George’s estate, 
asserted that (1) George and Sylvie were married on October 2, 1989 in Honolulu, Hawai
'i; (2) a Dominican Republic court granted 
a divorce decree terminating George and Sylvie’s marriage on February 7, 1995; (3) while residing in Hawai
'i, George 
introduced Geraldine to Sylvie; (4) George and Geraldine’s completed Marriage License Application indicated that George’s former marriage ended in 1995 in the Dominican Republic; (5) Geraldine signed the Marriage License Application and swore under oath that the information contained therein was true and correct; (6) George and Geraldine participated in a ceremonial marriage on
 May 1, 1996; (7) at the time of the marriage ceremony, Geraldine
 had actual or constructive knowledge of the Dominican Decree and
 that it was obtained in the Dominican Republic; (8) Geraldine and
 George subsequently met with Sylvie and Felicia Dubie (Felicia)
 
-12­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(daughter of George and Sylvie) in Ottawa in 1997 and in
 
Disneyworld in 1998; (9) Geraldine became close with Felicia and
 established a QTIP trust naming the children of George and Sylvie
 as beneficiaries; (10) Geraldine filed for a divorce from George
 in November 2003; and (11) after entry of the 11/28/03 Decree,
 Geraldine continued to portray herself as married to George “in
 order to protect her image, as well as the image of her
 company[.]”
8
 
With regard to Rule 60(b)(4), Nancy argued that
 
Geraldine’s assertions concerning the invalidity of her marriage
 to George were without merit. Specifically, Nancy argued that
 the Dominican Decree was valid and that, in any event, Geraldine
 did not have standing to collaterally attack the Dominican
 Decree. Nancy further argued that Geraldine was estopped from
 challenging the validity of her marriage to George. 
With regard to Rule 60(b)(6), Nancy argued that
 
Geraldine’s allegations “amount[ed] to a claim for relief based
 on ‘fraud[,]’” and therefore fell under Rule 60(b)(3), rather
 than Rule 60(b)(6). Nancy further argued that Geraldine’s motion
 was untimely because it was not filed within one year of the
 11/28/03 Decree, as required for motions brought pursuant to Rule
 
8
 In support of these assertions, Nancy relied on, inter alia,
Sylvie’s sworn declaration, which was included as an exhibit to Nancy’s
Memorandum in Opposition. Although Geraldine has presented various challenges
to the family court’s reliance on Sylvie’s declaration in its findings of
fact, we do not rely on the assertions set forth in Sylvie’s declaration in
reaching our decision. Accordingly, we need not address whether the family
court erred in relying on facts set forth in Sylvie’s declaration.
 
-13­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
60(b)(3).
 
3. Subsequent proceedings
 
The family court held a hearing on Geraldine’s Rule 60
 
motion on October 8, 2007.9 No live testimony was presented. 
The family court directed the parties to focus their argument on
 
Rule 60(b)(4), and the parties accordingly did not present any
 argument on the merits of the Rule 60(b)(6) portion of
 Geraldine’s motion. The parties’ arguments concerning Rule
 60(b)(4) substantially reiterated and expanded upon the arguments
 presented in their briefs. 
In addition, the parties presented some argument as to 
whether the family court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing on Geraldine’s Rule 60 motion. For example, counsel for Nancy argued that, “[s]ince under Ahlo[ v. Ahlo, 1 Haw. App. 324, 619 P.2d 112 (1980),] and Hayashi[ v. Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. 286, 666 P.2d 171 (1983)], the [Hawai
'i S]upreme [C]ourt has 
authorized the family court to have a threshold determination without an evidentiary hearing on whether [the] Rule [60(b)] motion should proceed and since we are the proponents of the essential dismissal of that, it would appear appropriate that we would argue first.” 
Counsel for Nancy later reiterated:
 
First of all, the Hawaii Supreme Court has already
spoken about the procedure that we’re here on today.
Hayashi . . . , essentially citing Ahlo . . . says the
 
9
 At the same hearing, the family court also heard Geraldine’s
motion to substitute Nancy as the defendant in this case. 
-14­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
trial court may deny relief under Rule [60(b)] without
holding a hearing, and they decide the issue on the
basis of papers submitted. This went back to the Ahlo
 case that essentially said the family court is not
required to hold a hearing in deciding whether or not
to grant relief under Rule 60.[
10]
 
Counsel for Geraldine did not move for or otherwise
 
request an evidentiary hearing. To the contrary, counsel for
 
Geraldine stated during his argument:
 
And I think we can get rid of this whole thing
when you grant summary judgment to us on [the Rule
60(b)(4)] part of it. Bifurcate the [Rule 60(b)(6)]
part which is the labor intensive evidentiary part
that you really would rather not have to do because
it’s going to take a long time and that’s what we’re
11
gonna do in the circuit court is that case.[ ] 
Bifurcate the [60(b)(4)], [60(b)(6)]. You grant
summary judgment under [60(b)(4)], we’re outta here.
 
The family court did not orally rule on Geraldine’s
 
Rule 60 motion. On December 18, 2007, the family court entered
 
its “Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Post-Decree Relief to
 Vacate Divorce Decree or Set Aside Property Division Pursuant to
 Hawaii Family Court Rule 60[(b)], Filed June 28, 2007.” 
10 These arguments were made in relation to Nancy’s opposition to
Geraldine’s motion for substitution. Nancy argued that, because Geraldine had
failed to make a threshold showing that she was entitled to relief under Rule
60(b), it was not necessary for the family court to grant the motion for
substitution. Specifically, Nancy stated:
 
Under the papers, our arguments flow that this is not
a void judgment and that their claim for fraud is
time-barred and that Rule [60(b)(6)] is not a valid
option under the way they pled it. So, I don’t think
we need to substitute.
 
. . . .
 Now, if you decide to, after the Rule [60(b)]
threshold hearing if that’s decided in their favor,
then yeah, obviously we have to substitute and proceed
(indiscernible) whatever proceedings we end up going
to and possibly for the purposes of taking an appeal
as well (indiscernible). . . .
 
11
 This appears to be a reference to either In re Estate of George
 
Patrick Dubie, P. No. 06-1-0700, or Personal Prosperity, Inc. v. Dubie, Civil
No. 07-1-2141-11 GWBC, both in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
-15­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Geraldine timely filed a notice of appeal and, on February 25,
 
2008, the family court entered its Findings of Fact and
 Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL) with respect to Geraldine’s claims. 
The family court’s FOFs/COLs provided, in pertinent part, as
 follows:
 
III. FINDINGS OF FACT[]
 
5. George [] married Sylvie [] on October 2, 1989 in
Honolulu, Hawai' i. 
6. On February 7, [sic] 1995, the [Dominican] court
granted [the Dominican] Decree, terminating the
marriage between [George] and Sylvie[.]
 
7. Notice of the [Dominican] Decree was mailed to
[George] that same day.
 
8. The [Dominican] Decree became a definite and final
ruling on the date of pronouncement, April 24, 1995.
 
9. Neither [George] nor Sylvie filed an appeal to set
aside the [Dominican] Decree.
 
10. The time-period [sic] to appeal the [Dominican]
Decree elapsed on April 7, 1995, two months after the
[Dominican] Decree was entered.
 
11. From February 2, 1995 until present, Sylvie relied
upon the validity of the [Dominican] Decree entered by
the [Dominican court].
 
12. Ever since the [Dominican] Decree was entered,
Sylvie has held herself out as being divorced from
[George].
 
13. Prior to [Geraldine’s Rule 60 motion], at no time
did anyone ever question the validity of the
[Dominican] Decree.
 
14. Sylvie did not question the validity of the
[Dominican] Decree because when purchasing a home in
1995, Sylvie successfully proved the validity of the
[Dominican] Decree to an attorney in the province of
Quebec, Canada.
 
15. In reliance on the [Dominican] Decree, Sylvie and
[George’s] daughter, Felicia (“Felicia”), had her last
name changed to “Dubie” so that she would be able to
live with her father.
 
16. In 1995, the U.S. Embassy certified and recognized
the [Dominican] Decree by acknowledging the Dominican
Republic divorce procedures.
 
-16­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
17. In or around March 1996, after his divorce from
Sylvie, [George] and [Geraldine] met. [Geraldine] is
co-founder of the diet herbal supplement company,
“Herbalife.”
 
18. Shortly thereafter, while residing in Hawai' i,
[George] introduced [Geraldine] to Sylvie. 19. With full knowledge of the [Dominican] Decree, on
or about April 30, 1996, [Geraldine] completed andsubmitted a Marriage License Application to theDepartment of Health for the State of Hawai' i. 
20. The application for marriage license indicated
that [George’s] marriage to Sylvie ended in divorce in
1995 in the Dominican Republic, Caribbean.
 
21. [Geraldine] signed the Marriage License
Application and swore under oath that the information
contained in the application was true and correct to
the best of her knowledge.
 
22. On May 1, 1996, [George] and [Geraldine]
participated in a ceremonial marriage performed by aperson duly authorized to perform marriages in theState of Hawai' i. 
23. At the time of the marriage ceremony, [Geraldine]
had knowledge, or at least, had constructive knowledge
of the [Dominican] Decree and that it was obtained in
the Dominican Republic.
 
24. In the following few years, [George] and
[Geraldine] met with Sylvie and Felicia in Ottawa in
1997, and in Disneyworld in 1998.
 
25. Based on Sylvie’s meetings with [George] and
[Geraldine], Sylvie had an opportunity to observe
[George] and [Geraldine’s] relationship. [George]
relied upon the validity of the [Dominican] Decree and
held himself out as being divorced. Sylvie also
observed that after [George] and [Geraldine] were
married, they acted like a married couple, lived
together and introduced each other as husband and
wife.
 
26. [Geraldine] established a Qualified Terminable
Interest Property Trust (“QTIP Trust”) and named
Sylvie and [George’s] children as beneficiaries of the
QTIP Trust.
 
27. In November 2003, [Geraldine] filed a petition for
divorce and the [family court] granted it on November
[28], 2003.
 
28. After the [11/28/03 Decree] was entered,
[Geraldine] continued to portray the image that she
and [George] were still married in order to protect
her image as well as the image of her company,
“Herbalife.”
 
-17­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
29. On July 2, 2006, [George] was shot and killed in
Thailand. A Report of Death of An American Citizen was
filed on November 8, 2006.
 
[IV.] CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 30. The [family court] has subject matter jurisdiction
and personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to
HRS § 580-1.
 
31. [Geraldine’s] claims sound in fraud or other
intentional misconduct, and therefore are time-barred
pursuant to [HFCR Rule] 60(b)(3).
 
32. Determining whether a judgment should be set aside
pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the [HFCR] is not a matter
of discretion.
 
33. In the sound interest of finality, the concept of
a void judgment must be narrowly restricted. 
34. [Geraldine] does not have standing to collaterally
attack the validity of the [Dominican] Decree in the
[family court].
 
35. The [Dominican] Decree is recognized by the
[family court] under the principle of comity. The
 [11/28/03 Decree] is not void ab initio and should not
be set aside.
 
36. The facts in this case are not enough to overcome
the presumption of validity of [Geraldine’s] marriage
to [George].
 
37. [George] and [Geraldine’s] marriage is not void
because the purported impediment-the alleged bigamous
marriage-was eliminated by [George’s] death.
 
38. The [Dominican] Decree cannot be set aside based
on the principle of res judicata.
 
39. [Geraldine] is estopped from asserting that [her]
marriage to [George] is void based on the principle of
estoppel and unclean hands.
 
40. Property settlement agreements between husband and
wife made in contemplation of divorce or judicial
separation are favored by the courts and will be
strictly enforced if fair and equitable and not
against public policy.
 
41. The property division portion of a Divorce Decree
is an enforceable contract and should not be set
 aside.
 
42. [Geraldine’s] assertion to set aside the property
division portion of the [11/28/03 Decree] is really a
creditor’s claim which should be decided by the
probate court.
 
43. [George] and [Geraldine] are at the very least,
 
-18­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
putative spouses for purposes of this court deciding
property division issues.
 
44. [Geraldine’s] claims to set aside the [11/28/03
Decree] and the [11/28/03 Decree’s] property division
portion are based on fraud and are therefore barred by
the one-year statute of limitations pursuant to Rule
60(b)(3) of the [HFCR].
 
(Formatting altered) (citations omitted).
 
C. ICA Appeal
 
In her Opening Brief, Geraldine alleged that the family
 
court erred in (1) refusing to vacate the 11/28/03 Decree because
 
it was void; (2) denying relief or an evidentiary hearing
 pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6); (3) entering FOFs 6-8, 10-17, 19,
 22-23, 25, and 27-28; and (4) entering COLs 30-32, and 34-44. 
In her Answering Brief, Nancy essentially reiterated
 
the arguments she presented in the family court. Nancy further
 argued that Geraldine was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing
 on her Rule 60(b)(6) motion, insofar as the ICA held in Hayashi
 that the family court may decide a Rule 60(b)(6) motion without a
 hearing. 
Geraldine did not raise any substantively new arguments
 
in her Reply Brief. 
The ICA filed its published opinion in the instant case 
on April 12, 2010. Cvitanovich-Dubie, 123 Hawai
'i at 266, 231 
P.3d at 983. With regard to Geraldine’s Rule 60(b)(4) claim that the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the 11/28/03 Decree because the Dominican Decree was void, the ICA held that the Dominican Decree was not entitled to “pro forma 
-19­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
recognition” on the basis of comity, id. at 273-75, 231 P.3d at
 
990-92, but was entitled to practical recognition on the basis of
 quasi-estoppel, id. at 275-80, 231 P.3d at 992-97. Accordingly,
 
12
the ICA held that, based on FOFs 11 through 25,  “the family
court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Geraldine was
 estopped from challenging the validity of the Dominican Decree,
 and COL 39 is not wrong.” Id. at 280, 231 P.3d at 997. 
The ICA further held that Geraldine’s claims of fraud
 
and undue influence fell under Rule 60(b)(3). Id. at 281-82, 231
 
P.3d at 998-99. The ICA noted that:
 
[Rule 60(b)(3)] does not specify upon whom the adverse
party must have committed the fraud,
misrepresentation, or other misconduct. Therefore,
although Geraldine characterizes [George’s] alleged
fraud as “fraud on the court,” that fraud claim
nevertheless still falls under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3).
Further, a plain reading of HFCR Rule 60(b) reveals
that “undue influence” falls within Rule 60(b)(3) as
“other misconduct.”
 
Id. at 282, 231 P.3d at 999.
 
The ICA further noted that Geraldine’s claims were
 
filed more than one year after the 11/28/03 Decree was entered,
 
and were therefore untimely under Rule 60(b)(3). Id. 
Accordingly, the ICA held, “the family court did not abuse its
 discretion by failing to provide Geraldine relief or a hearing
 regarding [her claims].” Id. 
12
 The ICA held that FOFs 11-16, 19, and 25, and a portion of FOF 23,
were not clearly erroneous. Id. at 276-78, 231 P.3d at 993-95. The ICA
 
further held that any error in the challenged portions of FOFs 6, 7, 10, 17
and 28 was harmless. Id. at 282, 231 P.3d at 999. The ICA did not address
 
Geraldine’s remaining challenges to the FOFs, in light of its conclusion that
Geraldine was estopped from challenging the Dominican Decree. Id. at 278,
 
283, 231 P.3d at 994, 1000. 
-20­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In light of the foregoing, the ICA did not address the
 
remaining issues raised by Geraldine in her Opening Brief. On
 
May 3, 2010, the ICA filed its judgment affirming the family
 court’s “Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Post-Decree Relief
 to Vacate Divorce Decree or Set Aside Property Division Pursuant
 to Hawaii Family Court Rule 60 [(b)], Filed on June 28, 2007.” 
D. Geraldine’s application for a writ of certiorari 
Geraldine timely filed an application for a writ of
 
certiorari on July 29, 2010. Nancy timely filed a response on
 
August 12, 2010.
 
In her application, Geraldine presents the following
 
questions:
 
A. Are estoppel or quasi estoppel available as
affirmative defenses to bar relief from a clearly void
ab initio Hawaii divorce decree, where allowingestoppel would vitalize that which multiple Hawaiistatutes declare void, legalize what public policy andthe law have forbidden, and violate this [c]ourt’sholdings in Godoy v. County of Hawaii, 44 Haw. 312,354 P.2d 78 (1960) and Alvarez Family Trust v. Ass’nof Owners, 121 Hawai' i 474, 221 P.3d 452 (2010)?
B. Is the application of quasi estoppel in this
case inconsistent with this [c]ourt’s holding in Yuen
Shee v. London Guaranty and Accident, 40 Haw. 213
(1953), and in facial violation of Anderson v.
Anderson, 59 Haw. 575, 585 P.2d 938 (1978)?
C. Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
commit grave error when it afforded practical
recognition to a void ab initio foreign divorce
decree?
 
D. Did the ICA commit grave error when it
affirmed estoppel in favor of a litigant with unclean
hands as a matter of law, and against one whose hands
were clean as a matter of law?
 
E. Did the ICA commit grave error when it held
that the standard of review for findings of fact
entered in the absence of any evidentiary hearing is
clearly erroneous, rather than de novo, and refused to
consider “the weight of the evidence” and the
“credibility” of witnesses when there was no live
testimony?
F. Did the ICA commit grave error when it held
that undue influence and fraud on the court fall
 within HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), rather than HFCR Rule
 
-21­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
60(b)(6), and that the alternative relief sought ­
i.e., to set aside the property settlement portion of
the decree - was therefore time barred?
 
II. Standards of Review
 
A. HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) motions
 
Under Rule 60(b)(4),
 
The determination of whether a judgment is void
is not a discretionary issue. It has been noted that
 a judgment is void only if the court that rendered it
lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or
the parties or otherwise acted in a manner
inconsistent with due process of law.
 
In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 146, 642 P.2d 938, 941
 
(App. 1982) (citation omitted).
 
Accordingly, we review the family court’s denial of a
 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) motion de novo. 
B. HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) motions
 
The family court’s denial of a motion under HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(6) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Pratt v. Pratt,
 
104 Hawai 'i 37, 42, 84 P.3d 545, 550 (2004). As the ICA noted in 
Hayashi: 
[s]ince Rule 60(b)(6) relief is contrary to the
general rule favoring finality of actions, the court
must carefully weigh all of the conflicting
considerations inherent in such applications. Once
 the court has made a determination to grant or deny
relief, the exercise of its discretion will not be set
aside unless the appellate court is persuaded that,
under the circumstances of the case, the court abused
its discretion.
 
4 Haw. App. at 291, 666 P.2d at 175 (citations omitted).
 
“[A]n abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court
 
has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or
 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
 
-22­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
party litigant.” Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai 'i 202, 211, 159 
P.3d 814, 823 (2007) (brackets in original) (quoting Office of 
Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 Hawai 'i 338, 351, 133 P.3d 767, 
780 (2006)). In addition, “[t]he burden of establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it.” In re RGB, 123 Hawai
'i 1, 17, 229 P.3d 1066, 1082 
(2010) (brackets in original) (citation omitted). 
III. Discussion 
Geraldine’s Rule 60 motion sought relief on alternative 
grounds pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) and Rule 60(b)(6). With regard to Rule 60(b)(4), Geraldine argued in the family court that the 11/28/03 Decree was void on the ground that Geraldine and George were never legally married because the Dominican Decree was void. The family court denied Geraldine’s motion in this respect on several grounds, including that the Dominican Decree was entitled to comity, and that Geraldine was estopped from challenging the validity of the Dominican Decree. On appeal, the ICA affirmed, concluding that Geraldine was estopped from challenging the validity of the Dominican Decree. Cvitanovich-Dubie, 123 Hawai
'i 
at 275-80, 231 P.3d at 992-97. Geraldine argues that the ICA erred because estoppel is inapplicable to the facts of the instant case. As set forth below, although the ICA did not err in affirming the family court’s order with regard to Geraldine’s claims under Rule 60(b)(4), its reasoning was erroneous in part. Specifically, the ICA was not required to reach the issue of 
-23­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
estoppel because the 11/28/03 Decree is not void within the
 
meaning of Rule 60(b)(4). 
Alternatively, Geraldine argued in the family court
 
that the property division portion of the 11/28/03 Decree should
 be set aside under Rule 60(b)(6), on the ground that the property
 division was the result of “fraud on the court” and “undue
 influence.” The family court denied Geraldine’s motion in this
 respect, finding that Geraldine’s claims “sound[ed] in fraud or
 other intentional misconduct[,]” and were therefore barred by the
 one-year limitation on motions brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3). 
The ICA affirmed, concluding that Geraldine’s claims of “fraud on
 the court” and “undue influence” fell within Rule 60(b)(3) and
 were accordingly untimely. Id. at 281-82, 231 P.3d at 998-99. 
Geraldine argues that the ICA erred because “fraud on the court”
 and “undue influence” are properly considered under Rule
 60(b)(6). As set forth below, the ICA did not err in affirming
 the family court’s order in this respect. 
A.	 Geraldine could not be estopped from challenging the family
court’s jurisdiction to enter the 11/28/03 Decree
 
The ICA held that the circuit court erred in COL 35 in
 
recognizing the Dominican Decree on the basis of comity, id. at
 
273-75, 231 P.3d at 990-92, but that the Dominican Decree was
 nonetheless entitled to practical recognition based on principles
 of quasi-estoppel, id. at 275-80, 231 P.3d at 992-97. Having
 thus concluded that Geraldine was estopped from contesting the
 validity of the Dominican Decree, the ICA concluded that it was
 
-24­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
not required to address Geraldine’s points concerning the
 
adequacy of notice to her of the Dominican Decree, or whether the
 Dominican Decree was subject to collateral attack.
13 Id. at 280,
 
231 P.3d at 997. Accordingly, it appears that the ICA concluded
 that the family court did not reversibly err in denying the Rule
 60(b)(4) portion of Geraldine’s Rule 60 motion, on the ground
 that Geraldine was estopped from contesting the validity of the
 Dominican Decree. Id. at 275-80, 231 P.3d at 992-97. In
 
essence, the ICA concluded that Geraldine was estopped from
 asserting that the 11/28/03 Decree was void.
 
However, Geraldine argued that the invalidity of the
 
Dominican Decree deprived the family court of jurisdiction to
 enter the 11/28/03 Decree. “[I]t is well-settled that
 subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a court by
 agreement, stipulation, or consent of the parties[.]” Gilmartin
 
v. Abastillas, 10 Haw. App. 283, 292, 869 P.2d 1346, 1351 (1994). Moreover, “[t]he lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived by the parties.” Williams v. Aona, 121 Hawai
'i 
1, 8, 210 P.3d 501, 508 (2009) (quoting Chun v. Employees Ret. 
13 As set forth in the family court’s COLs, the family court provided
several additional alternative grounds that could support its decision to deny
Geraldine’s Rule 60(b)(4) motion, including that Geraldine did not have
standing to collaterally attack the Dominican Decree in the family court.
There is substantial case law dealing with each of these issues. See
 
generally, R.F. Chase, Annotation, Domestic Recognition of Divorce Decree
Obtained in Foreign Country and Attacked for Lack of Domicil or Jurisdiction
of Parties, 13 A.L.R.3d 1419 (1967); Annotation, Vacating or Setting Aside
Divorce Decree After Remarriage of Party, 17 A.L.R.4th 1153, 1225-32 (1982)
(discussing decisions where a divorce decree is contested by a “[s]ubsequent
husband of divorced wife” or “[s]ubsequent wife of divorced husband”).
However, in light of the conclusion that the 11/28/03 Decree is not void
within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(4), this court need not address those issues. 
-25­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Sys., 73 Haw. 9, 13, 828 P.2d 260, 263 (1992)). It follows that
 
jurisdiction similarly cannot be created by estoppel. See Ins.
 
Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456
 U.S. 694, 702 (1982) (“[N]o action of the parties can confer
 subject-matter jurisdiction upon a federal court. Thus, . . .
 principles of estoppel do not apply[.]”) (citations omitted).
 
Accordingly, Geraldine could not be estopped from
 
challenging the family court’s jurisdiction to enter the 11/28/03
 Decree. The ICA’s determination that Geraldine was estopped from
 challenging the Dominican Decree thus cannot resolve whether the
 11/28/03 Decree is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction
 pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4), and the ICA erred in failing to
 address that issue. 
B. The 11/28/03 Decree is not void under Rule 60(b)(4)
 
Geraldine argues that the family court’s 11/28/03
 
Decree is void because, as a result of the invalid Dominican
 
Decree, she and George were not legally married, and the family
 court lacked jurisdiction to enter a divorce decree involving
 unmarried persons. We conclude that Geraldine’s arguments do not
 fall within the scope of Rule 60(b)(4).
 
“In the sound interest of finality, the concept of a
 
void judgment must be narrowly restricted.” Dillingham Inv.
 
Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Trust, 8 Haw. App. 226, 233, 797 P.2d
 1316, 1320 (1990) (quoting 7 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s
 Federal Practice ¶ 60.25[2], at 60-225, 60-229, 60-230 (2d ed.
 
-26­   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1990)). “The principles of judicial economy and judicial
 
finality operate as constraining influences upon the generosity
 of the courts in declaring judgments void.” Isemoto Contracting
 
Co., Ltd. v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 206, 616 P.2d 1022, 1026
 (1980). The ICA has explained that:
 
The determination of whether a judgment is void is not
a discretionary issue. It has been noted that a
judgment is void only if the court that rendered it
lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or
the parties or otherwise acted in a manner
14
inconsistent with due process of law.[ ] Wright &
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil s 2862
(1973). Other authorities, cognizant of the
extraordinary remedy afforded by the rule and the need
to narrowly define it, have stated:
 
In brief, then, except for the rare case where
power is plainly usurped, if a court has the
general power to adjudicate the issues in the
class of suits to which the case belongs then
its interim orders and final judgment, whether
right or wrong, are not subject to collateral
attack . . . .
 
In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. at 146, 642 P.2d at 941-42
 
(emphasis added) (ellipses in original) (quoting 7 James Wm.
 Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 60.25 (1980)); see also
 Dillingham Inv. Corp., 8 Haw. App. at 233-34, 797 P.2d at 1320
 (“[I]f a court has the general power to adjudicate the issues in
 the class of suits to which the case belongs then its interim
 orders and final judgments, whether right or wrong, are not
 subject to collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the
 subject matter is concerned.”) (quoting 7 James Wm. Moore et al.,
 Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 60.25[2], at 60-229, 60-230 (2d ed.
 
14
 Geraldine has not argued that the family court lacked jurisdiction
over the parties, or that the 11/28/03 Decree violated due process.
Accordingly, we do not address these other two bases on which a judgment may
be found void pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4). 
-27­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1990)). 
It should be noted that this court has concluded that a 
judgment was void under Rule 60(b)(4) on only one occasion. In 
Stafford v. Dickison, 46 Haw. 52, 63, 374 P.2d 665, 672 (1962), we held that a default judgment was void under Hawai
'i Rules of 
15
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(4)  on the ground that the
defendant had been denied due process. There, a default judgment
 was ordered against the defendant during a hearing at which
 defendant did not appear. Id. However, “defendant’s
 
nonappearance was due to the court’s abuse of discretion in
 permitting the withdrawal of his counsel without notice.” Id. at
 
63, 374 P.2d at 671. Moreover, the court “erroneously reliev[ed]
 plaintiff of the duty of giving notice of application for default
 judgment” to the defendant. Id. Accordingly, this court
 
concluded that the defendant did not have proper notice, and held
 that the default judgment was void pursuant to HRCP Rule
 60(b)(4). Id. at 63, 374 P.2d at 672.
 
In the instant case, there can be no question that
 
Geraldine’s Complaint for Divorce was “in the class of suits”
 that the family court “has the general power to adjudicate.” See
 
15
 The ICA has explained that:
 
Rule 60(b), HFCR, is similar to Rule 60(b), [HRCP] and
Rule 60(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP),
except for some minor variations which do not affect
the provisions concerned here. Therefore, the
treatises and cases interpreting HRCP, Rule 60(b) and
FRCP, Rule 60(b) provide persuasive reasoning for the
interpretation of HFCR 60(b).

It is requested of the Court:
That a decree be entered granting a divorce from
the bonds of matrimony . . . .
 
On November 7, 2003, George filed an Appearance and
 
Waiver, acknowledging receipt of a filed copy of the Complaint
 
and Summons in the divorce action, and consenting to a hearing of
 the complaint without his presence. 
Based on the foregoing, the family court did not
 
“plainly usurp[]” power in granting the 11/28/03 Decree. See
 
Dillingham Inv. Corp., 8 Haw. App. at 233-34, 797 P.2d at 1320;
 see also Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 65 (2d Cir. 1986) (“[A]
 court will be deemed to have plainly usurped jurisdiction only
 when there is a ‘total want of jurisdiction’ and no arguable
 basis on which it could have rested a finding that it had
 jurisdiction.”) (citation omitted). 
Nevertheless, Geraldine argues that the 11/28/03 Decree
 
is void because “divorce presupposes and requires a valid
 marriage.” Geraldine further argues that the 11/28/03 Decree is
 void pursuant to HRS § 1-6, which provides that “[w]hatever is
 done in contravention of a prohibitory law is void, although the
 nullity be not formally directed.” Put another way, Geraldine
 argues that her marriage was bigamous and therefore violated
 prohibitory law, and that the marriage was therefore void ab
 initio pursuant to HRS § 1-6. 
Assuming arguendo that the question of whether a
 
marriage is valid goes to the family court’s jurisdiction to
 
-30­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
enter a divorce,16 Geraldine’s challenges to the family court’s
 
jurisdiction would have been relevant had she raised them in the
 
divorce proceedings or in a direct appeal. However, on a Rule
 60(b)(4) motion, the principle of finality narrows the scope of
 review. Dillingham Inv. Corp., 8 Haw. App. at 233-34, 797 P.2d
 
16 We note that HRS § 580-1, concerning the jurisdiction of the
family court, provides only that “[n]o absolute divorce from the bond of
matrimony shall be granted for any cause unless either party to the marriagehas been domiciled or has been physically present in the State for acontinuous period of at least six months next preceding the applicationtherefor.” (Emphasis added). HRS § 580-1 does not contain a jurisdictionalrequirement that the parties be lawfully married in order to seek a divorce.Rather, it appears that a valid marriage is more properly considered asubstantive requirement for a valid divorce. See HRS § 580-1 (setting forth
when the family court “shall decree a divorce from the bond of matrimony”)(emphasis added); cf. Whitehead v. Whitehead, 53 Haw. 302, 315-16, 492 P.2d939, 947 (1972) (noting that the “jurisdictional” nature of the domicilerequirement in HRS § 580-1 did not mean that the court “was without authorityto hear the case in the absence of the required proof of domicile” but thatthe domicile provision “sets forth a substantive requirement for divorce”);Puckett v. Puckett, 94 Hawai' i 471, 482-83, 16 P.3d 876, 887-88 (App. 2000)
(applying Whitehead, 53 Haw. at 315, 492 P.2d at 947); see also Kansas City S.Ry. Co. v. Great Lakes Carbon Corp., 624 F.2d 822, 825 (8th Cir. 1980)(rejecting an argument that a judgment was void under FRCP Rule 60(b)(4), andnoting that an “error in interpreting a statutory grant of jurisdiction is notequivalent to acting with total want of jurisdiction” and that “[s]uch anerroneous interpretation does not render the judgment a complete nullity”).
Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 Hawai' i 459, 121 P.3d 924 (App. 2005),
further supports an inference that the requirement of a valid marriage is notjurisdictional. There, Ronnie-Jean Kuulei Tagupa (Ronnie-Jean) and VincentPeter Tagupa (Vincent) were married on September 15, 1989. Id. at 459, 461, 
121 P.3d at 924, 926. In 2001, Ronnie-Jean filed a Complaint for Divorce andVincent subsequently filed a Counter-Claim for Annulment. Id. at 461-62, 121 
P.3d at 926-27. Ronnie-Jean subsequent filed a Certified Copy of the Judgmentof Divorce, indicating that Thornton G. Sanders (Sanders) obtained a Judgmentof Divorce terminating his marriage to Ronnie-Jean on December 21, 1989. Id. 
at 462, 121 P.3d at 927. Despite this undisputed evidence that Ronnie-Jean’sdivorce from Sanders had not been finalized at the time of her marriage toVincent, the family court denied Vincent’s claim for annulment and entered adivorce decree. Id. 
On appeal, the ICA concluded that Ronnie-Jean and Vincent had not
satisfied the requirements for a valid marriage contract because Ronnie-Jean
still had a living lawful husband at the time of her marriage to Vincent. Id.
 
at 465, 121 P.3d at 930. The ICA concluded that the family court abused its
discretion in entering the divorce decree and denying Vincent’s claim for
annulment, and accordingly vacated portions of the family court’s divorce
decree and remanded. Id. at 465-67, 121 P.3d at 930-32 (holding that “the
family court disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant”). Although the ICA determined that
the family court erred in entering the divorce decree, it did not state that
the error was jurisdictional. 
-31­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 1320. Because the family court had “power to adjudicate the
 
issues in the class of suits to which the case belongs,” i.e.,
 divorce proceedings, its judgment is not subject to collateral
 attack pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4). See In re Hana Ranch Co.,
 
3 Haw. App. at 146, 642 P.2d at 941-42 (citation omitted) (“[I]f
 a court has the general power to adjudicate the issues in the
 class of suits to which the case belongs then its interim orders
 and final judgment, whether right or wrong, are not subject to
 collateral attack.”); see also Dillingham Inv. Corp., 8 Haw. App.
 at 233-34, 797 P.2d at 1320 (“[I]f a court has the general power
 to adjudicate the issues in the class of suits to which the case
 belongs then its interim orders and final judgments, whether
 right or wrong, are not subject to collateral attack, so far as
 jurisdiction over the subject matter is concerned.”).
 
Accordingly, although the ICA erred in its reasoning,
 
it did not err in affirming the family court’s order denying
 Geraldine’s motion under Rule 60(b)(4).
17
 
C. 	Geraldine’s claims of “fraud on the court” and “undue
 
influence” fall within Rule 60(b)(3) and are therefore
untimely
 
In addition to her argument under Rule 60(b)(4),
 
17
 Based on the foregoing, the ICA was not required to address
whether Geraldine was estopped from contesting the validity of the Dominican
Decree. In addition, insofar as FOFs 11 through 16, 19, 25 and that part of
FOF 23 concerning Geraldine’s knowledge of the Dominican Decree, go to either
the validity of the Dominican Decree or Geraldine’s ability to collaterally
attack the Dominican Decree, the ICA was not required to address Geraldine’s
challenge to those FOFs. Accordingly, we do not address Geraldine’s
challenges to the ICA’s application of quasi-estoppel, and need not resolve
whether the ICA applied the proper standard of review in considering the
family court’s FOFs. 
-32­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Geraldine argues that the Property Settlement Agreements 
attendant to the 11/28/03 Decree should be set aside under Rule 60(b)(6) because they were the result of George’s “fraud upon the court” and “undue influence.” However, the ICA concluded that Rule 60(b)(3) applies to those claims. Cvitanovich-Dubie, 123 
Hawai
'i at 281-82, 231 P.3d at 998-99. Accordingly, the ICA 
concluded that Geraldine’s Rule 60 motion was untimely under Rule 60(b)(3), because it was brought more than one year after the 11/28/03 Decree was entered. Id. at 282, 231 P.3d at 999. As 
set forth below, the ICA did not err in concluding that Geraldine’s claims of “fraud upon the court” and “undue influence” were properly considered under principles applicable to Rule 60(b)(3) motions, and were accordingly untimely. 
Rule 60(b)(3) provides that the court may relieve a
 
party of a final judgment for the reasons of “fraud (whether
 heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic),
 misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.” 
Under Rule 60(b)(3), a motion for relief from judgment must be
 made “not more than one year after the judgment, order, or
 proceedings was entered or taken.” Rule 60(b)(3). 
In contrast, Rule 60(b)(6) provides that the court may
 
relieve a party of a final judgment for “any other reason
 justifying relief[.]” A motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(6)
 must be made “within a reasonable time.” Rule 60(b). The ICA
 has explained that, in bringing a motion under Rule 60(b)(6), a
 
-33­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
movant must meet three threshold requirements: “the movant must
 
show that (1) the motion is based on some reason other than those
 specifically stated in clauses 60(b)(1) through (5); (2) the
 reason urged is such as to justify the relief; and (3) the motion
 is made within a reasonable time.” Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290,
 
666 P.2d at 174 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). 
In the instant case, Geraldine filed her Rule 60 motion
 
on June 28, 2007, more than three years after the family court’s
 11/28/03 Decree. Accordingly, if her claims are construed as
 falling within the provisions of Rule 60(b)(3), her Rule 60
 motion was untimely. See Rule 60(b). In contrast, if
 
Geraldine’s claims are construed as falling within the provisions
 of Rule 60(b)(6), relief is available if the court finds her
 motion was made “within a reasonable time,” and there are
 “reason[s] justifying relief.” See Rule 60(b); see also Hayashi,
 
4 Haw. App. at 290-91, 666 P.2d at 174-75.
 
As set forth below, Geraldine’s claims of “fraud upon
 
the court” and “undue influence” fall within the provisions of
 Rule 60(b)(3) and are therefore untimely. 
1. Fraud on the court
 
This court has noted that, “[s]ince the remedy for
 
fraud on the court is far reaching, it only applies to very
 
unusual cases involving ‘far more than an injury to a single
 litigant[,]’ but rather, a ‘corruption of the judicial process
 itself.’” Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96
 
-34­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawai'i 408, 431 n.42, 32 P.3d 52, 75 n.42 (2001) (citation 
omitted) (some brackets in original); see also Matsuura v. E.I Du 
Pont de Nemours & Co., 102 Hawai 'i 149, 171, 73 P.3d 687, 709 
(2003) (Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting) (“fraud on the court is not fraud on a party”). It is generally accepted that fraudulent conduct such as perjury or non-disclosure by a party, standing alone, is insufficient to make out a claim for fraud on the court. See, e.g., Gleason v. Jandrucko, 860 F.2d 556, 559-60 
(2d Cir. 1988) (“[N]either perjury nor nondisclosure, by itself, amounts to anything more than fraud involving a single litigant.”); Lockwood v. Bowles, 46 F.R.D. 625, 632-34 (D.D.C. 1969) (“[W]here the court or its officers are not involved, there is no fraud upon the court within the meaning of [FRCP] Rule 60(b).”); see also 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 60.21[4][c] (3d ed. 2010) (“Fraud on the court may not be established simply by showing some misconduct by one of the parties to the suit. . . . If fraud on the court were to be given a broad interpretation that encompassed fraudulent misconduct between the parties, a judgment would always remain subject to challenge, and the one-year time limitation applicable to motions based on Rule 60(b)(3) would be meaningless.”) (footnotes omitted). 
This court has similarly explained that:
 
Not any fraud connected with the presentation of
a case amounts to fraud on the court. It must be a
 
“direct assault on the integrity of the judicial
process.” Courts have required more than nondisclosure
by a party or the party’s attorney to find fraud on
 
-35­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the court. Examples of such fraud include “bribery of
a judge,” and “the employment of counsel in order to
bring an improper influence on the court.”
 
Schefke, 96 Hawai 'i at 431, 32 P.3d at 75 (citations omitted); 
cf. Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Doe, 98 Hawai 'i 499, 504, 
51 P.3d 366, 371 (2002) (holding that an allegation that “counsel
 
had lied during the underlying proceedings in order to induce [a
 party] to agree to the judgment of paternity” was properly
 considered as fraud under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3)). 
Here, the record does not establish that George knew
 
the Dominican Decree was invalid, or that he deliberately
 misrepresented his marital status to the family court.
18
 
Moreover, Geraldine’s allegation that George “conceal[ed] the
 fact that he had never divorced Sylvie” in order to “gain access
 
18 We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion that
Geraldine established George’s knowledge of the invalidity of the Dominican
Decree through (1) Geraldine’s declaration that she realized, after George’sdeath, that George and Sylvie were not lawfully divorced; and (2) anattorney’s declaration that, in his view, the Dominican Decree wassubstantively invalid. Dissenting opinion at 34-35. Respectfully, thesedeclarations do not purport to address George’s knowledge as to the validityof the Dominican Decree. Further, we are reluctant to ascribe import to thefact that, subsequent to their divorce, George and Sylvie were denominated as“husband” and “wife” in a Variation of Separation Agreement that altered theiragreement with regard to custody of their daughter. See dissenting opinion at 
35-36. It is not uncommon for divorced parties to be referred to in thismanner, see, e.g., Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 121 Hawai' i 401, 220 P.3d 264
(App. 2009), vacated in non-relevant part by Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123Hawai'i 68, 229 P.3d 1133 (2010), and the mere use of those terms in the
agreement does not establish that George knew the Dominican Decree wasinvalid. 
We also respectfully disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that
George concealed his marital status from the family court during the divorce
proceedings because he filed an appearance and waiver form, and because George
indicated in that form that he agreed to the matters set forth in an agreement
incident to divorce. Dissenting opinion at 36-37. Although these facts
indicate that George “held himself out as being married to Geraldine,” id.,
they do not establish that he purposefully concealed information or made a
fraudulent representation to the court.
We further note that it was Geraldine, rather than George, who
declared, under penalty of perjury, that “[t]he parties . . . [were] lawfully
married to each other.” In contrast, none of George’s responsive submissions
to the family court aver to the legality of his marriage to Geraldine. 
-36­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to [the family court],” is an allegation of nondisclosure by an
 
adverse party, rather than an allegation amounting to a “‘direct
 assault on the integrity of the judicial process.’”
19 See
 
Schefke, 96 Hawai 'i at 431, 32 P.3d at 75. Although Geraldine 
styles this portion of her motion as one for “fraud on the
 court,” the substance of her allegations does not rise to the
 level of fraud on the court. Accordingly, this allegation is
 properly evaluated as “fraud . . ., misrepresentation, or other
 misconduct of an adverse party” under Rule 60(b)(3).
20
 
19 The dissent cites Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 
Hawai'i 214, 948 P.2d 1055 (1997), and Southwest Slopes, Inc. v. Lum, 81 
Hawai'i 501, 918 P.2d 1157 (App. 1996), for the proposition that “non­
disclosure can amount to fraud on the court when the party and the trial court
have no reason to question the representation, and the court relies on therepresentation when issuing its decision.” Dissenting opinion at 42 (footnoteomitted). However, Kawamata Farms and Southwest Slopes do not stand for thisproposition and, in any event, are distinguishable.
In Kawamata Farms, the circuit court concluded that the defendants
had committed “discovery fraud upon the circuit court” by, inter alia,fraudulently asserting to the Discovery Master that the work product privilegebarred discovery of certain documents. 86 Hawai' i at 229-30, 948 P.2d at
1070-71. Thus, Kawamata Farms did not involve “non-disclosure,” but ratherfraudulent misrepresentations that formed the substantive basis for thecircuit court’s discovery orders. Moreover, this court relied on the“egregious nature of the fraud” perpetrated by defendants in allowing theplaintiffs to seek additional affirmative relief under Rule 60(b)(3),notwithstanding that Rule 60(b) can generally only be used to set aside aprior order or judgment. Id. at 256-57, 948 P.2d at 1097-98.
In Southwest Slopes, the asserted fraud involved a potentially
false affidavit by a party, as well as an apparently false affidavit andletter by the party’s attorney. 81 Hawai' i at 511, 918 P.2d at 1167. It is 
well-settled that fraud perpetuated by an officer of the court can constitutefraud on the court. See Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 431, 32 P.3d at 75 (citations
omitted) (noting that “the employment of counsel in order to bring an improperinfluence on the court” can constitute fraud on the court). Thus, the ICArecognized “[t]he possibility that Plaintiffs used fraud upon the court” inobtaining summary judgment. Sw. Slopes, 81 Hawai' i at 511, 918 P.2d at 1167
(emphasis added). 
20
 Because we conclude that Geraldine’s claims do not constitute
 
fraud on the court but rather “fraud . . ., misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party” that is properly considered under Rule
60(b)(3), we do not resolve whether fraud on the court properly falls under
Rule 60(b)(3) or Rule 60(b)(6). Although the dissenting opinion urges us to
address this issue, dissenting opinion at 43 n.22, in light of our holding,
any attempt to do so would be considered dicta.
 
-37­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Geraldine cites several cases which she suggests stand
 
for the proposition that her claim is properly considered under
 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(6). However, these cases are inapposite and
 accordingly do not support Geraldine’s position.
21
 
Accordingly, the ICA did not err in holding that the
 
family court did not abuse its discretion in denying Geraldine
 relief in this respect. 
2. “Undue influence”
 
The ICA concluded that “a plain reading of HFCR Rule
 
21 In Kawamata Farms, this court held that a defendant’s extensive 
discovery abuses constituted fraud on the court. 86 Hawai' i at 256-57, 948
P.2d at 1097-98. However, this court affirmed the grant of relief pursuant to
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3), rather than Rule 60(b)(6). Id. at 257-58, 948 P.2d at 
1098-99. 
In Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 239
(1944), an action was brought independent of Rule 60(b), for “leave to file a
bill of review . . . to set aside a judgment[,]” Id. at 239, and the only
discussion of FRCP Rule 60(b) was in the dissent, id. at 255-56. Moreover,
Hazel-Atlas Glass was decided in 1944, at a time when “there was considerable
doubt whether fraud was a ground for a motion under [FRCP] Rule 60(b) or
whether it could be attacked only by an independent action.” 11 Wright,
Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2860 at 310 (2d ed.
1995). In 1946, FRCP Rule 60(b) was amended to include “fraud” as an express
ground for relief from judgment. FRCP Rule 60 advisory committee’s notes on
1946 amdt. 
In Geo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 45 (1st
Cir. 1995), Reintjes brought an independent action for fraud on the ground
that an employee of Riley Stoker committed perjury during arbitration
proceedings that led to a settlement agreement two years earlier. The United
 States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected the argument that
Reintjes’ claim could proceed as an independent action for fraud on the court,
and instead concluded that “perjury alone” was insufficient to bring a common
law cause of action for fraud independent of FRCP Rule 60(b)(3). Id. at 48­
49. Accordingly, the court concluded that Rientjes’ claim was subject to the
limitations of FRCP Rule 60(b)(3) and was untimely since it was filed “some
two years” after the underlying judgment. Id. at 45, 49.
Finally, in Southwest Slopes, the ICA vacated a grant of summary
judgment in defendant’s favor on direct appeal. 81 Hawai' i at 502, 918 P.2d
at 1158. The ICA noted “[t]he possibility that Plaintiffs used fraud upon thecourt when obtaining the summary judgment,” and that “[f]raud,misrepresentation, and circumvention used to obtain a judgment are generallyregarded as sufficient cause for the opening or vacating of the judgment.”Id. at 511, 918 P.2d at 1167 (citation omitted). Although not directlyrelevant because it was decided on direct appeal, the ICA’s conclusionindicates that fraud on the court is properly considered as a type of “fraud.” 
-38­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
60(b) reveals that ‘undue influence’ falls within Rule 60(b)(3) 
as ‘other misconduct.’” Cvitanovich-Dubie, 123 Hawai 'i at 282, 
231 P.3d at 999. Geraldine argues that the ICA erred because “undue influence is deemed to be a matter within Rule 60(b)(6)[.]” 
Rule 60(b)(3) allows a party to move for relief from 
judgment on the basis of “fraud . . ., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party[.]” Rule 60(b)(6) allows a party to move for relief for “any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.” (Emphasis added). Thus, in order to take advantage of the potentially more lenient timeliness provisions in clause (6), “the motion must be based upon some reason other than those stated in clauses (1) through (5).” Child Support Enforcement Agency, 98 Hawai
'i at 504, 51 
P.3d at 371. Hawai 'i courts have not directly addressed whether 
a claim of undue influence falls under clause (3) or (6) of Rule 60(b). However, the plain language of the rule indicates that clause (3) governs misconduct by the non-moving party. Compare 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) (“fraud . . ., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party”) (emphasis added) with HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) (“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”). Although undue influence is not specifically identified in clause (3), “other misconduct of an adverse party” is a catch-all provision that reasonably includes the “undue 
-39­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
influence” Geraldine alleges.22 Cf. Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,
 
862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir. 1988) (“For the term [misconduct] to
 
have meaning in the [FRCP] Rule 60(b)(3) context, it must differ
 from both ‘fraud’ and ‘misrepresentation.’ Definition of this
 difference requires us to take an expansive view of
 ‘misconduct.’”).
 
Moreover, because HFCR Rule 60(b) was patterned after
 
23
FRCP Rule 60(b),  the history of the federal rule is highly
persuasive as to the purpose of the Hawai
'i rule, absent contrary 
intent in Hawai 'i. The history of the federal rule strongly 
supports the conclusion that undue influence falls within clause
 (3), rather than clause (6). The FRCP were adopted in 1937, and
 
22 We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion that we have
“abandon[ed] established statutory construction rules” by relying on the plain
language of Rule 60(b)(3). Dissenting opinion at 45. Moreover, our
interpretation does not leave Rule 60(b)(3) “without any manageable limits,”
dissenting opinion at 45, inasmuch as the rule is limited to the conduct of an
adverse party. See 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure:
Civil 2d § 2864 at 352-53 (“Fraud by the party’s own counsel, by a
codefendant, or by a third-party witness does not fit within clause (3) of the
rule, which requires fraud by an adverse party, and relief has been granted
under clause (6) instead.”).
Further, we respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion
that undue influence does not fall under Rule 60(b)(3) because it is “based on
conduct that is different from fraud and misrepresentation.” Dissenting
opinion at 28-29.  If relief under Rule 60(b)(3) were limited to conduct
involving false representations, as the dissent asserts, the phrase “other
misconduct” would be rendered surplusage. Although the dissent points to
other “causes of action” (such as defamation, libel and slander) that also
involve false representations, dissenting opinion at 45, it does not appear
that these causes of action could be grounds for setting aside a judgment
pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3).

 The HFCR were patterned after the HRCP, which in turn were
patterned after the FRCP. J. Garner Anthony, Chairman, Hawai' i Procedural 
Rules Committee, Foreword to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure, at ii (1953);
Letter from the Honorable Paul C. Kokubun & V. Thomas Rice, Co-Chairmen,Hawai'i Family Court Rules Drafting Committee, to committee members (June 24,
1974) (attached to June 24, 1974 draft of HFCR). As discussed supra in note15, the relevant portions of the current text of HFCR Rule 60(b) and FRCP Rule60(b) are virtually identical.

became effective in 1938. Order of December 20, 1937, 302 U.S.
 
783 (1937); 28 U.S.C.A. following § 723c. Prior to that time,
 the federal district courts were subject to an inflexible rule
 concerning relief from judgments, which generally prevented the
 district court from reconsidering its final judgments after the
 expiration of the term in which the judgment was rendered. James
 Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B.A. Rogers, Federal Relief from Civil
 Judgments, 55 Yale L.J. 623, 627 (1946). However, 
[e]xceptions to this general rule were the
utilization, under certain circumstances, of the
ancillary remedies of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita
querela, bill of review and bill in the nature of a
bill of review--remedies which had grown up to give
relief after term time in certain limited situations;
the occasional utilization of the doctrine of the
 court’s inherent power over its judgments; and the
independent action in equity to enjoin enforcement of
a judgment.
 
Id. (footnote omitted).
 
When the FRCP were promulgated, they were “generally
 
supposed to cover the field” concerning the practice for
 
obtaining relief from judgments. Advisory Committee Notes to
 1946 Amendment to FRCP Rule 60 (discussing the promulgation of
 the FRCP). However, a number of federal decisions initially
 concluded that efforts to obtain relief through the older
 ancillary and equitable remedies, such as a bill of review or
 coram nobis, were proper despite the adoption of the FRCP. See
 
id.; see also Moore & Rogers, 55 Yale L.J. at 653-82. 
Accordingly, amendments to FRCP Rule 60(b) were promulgated in
 1946 to “abolish[] the use of bills of review and the other
 common law writs referred to,” and to permit “either by motion or
 
-41­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
by independent action, the granting of various kinds of relief
 
from judgments which were permitted in the federal courts prior
 to the adoption of these rules[.]” Advisory Committee Notes to
 1946 Amendment to FRCP Rule 60. Put another way, FRCP Rule 60(b)
 effectively superceded the ancillary and equitable remedies with
 respect to the practice for obtaining relief from judgments.
 
Federal courts have indicated that “[FRCP] Rule
 
60(b)(3) is the lineal descendant of the equity rule that a court
 may alter or annul, because of fraud or undue influence, a
 written instrument (such as a contract or patent-but also a
 court’s own judgment), only if the fraud or undue influence is
 proved by clear and convincing evidence.”

 added) (citations omitted); Massi v. Walgreen Co., No.
 3:05-cv-425, 2008 WL 2066453, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. May 13, 2008). 
In contrast, FRCP Rule 60(b)(6), which was added with the
 amendments promulgated in 1946, was “an unprecedented addition to
 
24 The dissent asserts that this statement by the Seventh Circuit is
erroneous because it cites Hazel-Atlas Glass, 322 U.S. at 244-45, for support,
and the opinion in Hazel-Atlas Glass case does not contain the words “undue
influence.” Dissenting opinion at 49. However, it is clear that, prior to
the adoption of the 1946 amendments to the FRCP, a suit in equity could be
used to alter or annul a written instrument or judgment on the grounds of
fraud or undue influence. See, e.g., Wagg v. Herbert, 215 U.S. 546, 551-52
(1910) (“[I]t is well established that, in a suit in equity between parties,
in which fraud, oppression, and undue influence are charged, the court is not
concluded by that which appears on the face of the papers, but may institute
an inquiry into the real facts of the transactions. So thoroughly is this
doctrine established that any discussion of the cases in this and other courts
affirming it would be useless. They rest upon elementary principles of
equity.”) (emphasis added); cf. Griffith v. Bank of New York, 147 F.2d 899,
901 (2d. Cir. 1945) (holding that an allegation that a judgment was procured
by the trustee’s threat to tie up the property indefinitely unless settlement
was made constituted an allegation of duress or fraud sufficient to set aside
a prior judgment under a court’s equity powers). 
-42­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Rules” that could be used to “grant relief in situations
 
never covered by the old post-term remedies[.]” Note, Federal
 Rule 60(B): Relief From Civil Judgments, 61 Yale L.J. 76, 81 &
 n.25 (1952); see also 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice
 and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2864 at 350 (footnote omitted) (noting
 that FRCP Rule 60(b)(6) went “beyond the grounds for relief that
 would have been available under older procedures”). Thus,
 because a claim of undue influence was cognizable under the
 equity rules, it appears that it is properly cognizable under
 FRCP Rule 60(b)(3), rather than Rule 60(b)(6). Cf. In re Leisure
 
Corp., No. C-03-03012 RMW, 2007 WL 607696, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Feb.
 23, 2007) (holding that allegations of duress were properly
 considered under FRCP Rule 60(b)(3)); Interactive Edge, Inc. v.
 Martise, No. 97 Civ. 3354(RO), 1998 WL 35131, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.
 Jan. 30, 1998) (“[Defendant’s] allegations of threats from
 plaintiff’s counsel, creating a climate of extreme duress under
 which [defendant] signed the Settlement Agreement, raise the
 specter of Rule 60(b)(3)[] . . . .”).
 
Other states also appear to treat allegations of undue
 
influence as “other misconduct of an adverse party” under
 provisions similar to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3). See, e.g., Self v.
 
Maynor, 421 So. 2d 1279, 1280-81 (Ala. Civ. App. 1982) (holding
 that a claim of “fraud and/or undue influence” does not fall
 within the purview of Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure Rule
 60(b)(6) because “Rule 60(b)(6) is mutually exclusive from other
 
-43­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rule 60(b) motions” and “the relief sought falls clearly within
 
the purview of either 60(b)(1) or (2) or (3)”); Rothschild v.
 Devos, 757 N.E.2d 219, 224 n.9 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (“Duress and
 undue influence could presumably be grounds for relief from
 judgment under [Indiana Rules of Trial Procedure Rule] 60(B)(3)
 as ‘other misconduct of an adverse party.’”) (citation omitted);
 Coppley v. Coppley, 496 S.E.2d 611, 616-18 (N.C. Ct. App. 1998)
 (considering allegations of “duress and/or undue influence” as
 “other misconduct of an adverse party” under North Carolina Rules
 of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)(3)); Knutson v. Knutson, 639 N.W.2d
 495, 498-500 (N.D. 2002) (considering allegations that a
 stipulated agreement attendant to a divorce decree was procured
 through undue influence under North Dakota Rules of Civil
 Procedure Rule 60(b)(iii)).

Geraldine relies on Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290, 666
 
P.2d at 174, for the proposition that “undue influence is deemed
 to be a matter within Rule 60(b)(6)[.]” However, Hayashi does
 not stand for that proposition. In that case, Wife moved for
 relief pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6), alleging, inter alia,
 
25
 We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s conclusion that these
cases are “inapposite” and have no bearing on whether a claim of undue
influence can be considered under Rule 60(b)(6). Dissenting opinion at 51-52.In each case, the court determined that a claim of undue influence could bebrought under provisions similar to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3). Because a motion brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) must be based on “some reason other thanthose stated in clauses (1) through (5)[,]” a determination that a claim fallsunder Rule 60(b)(3) necessarily precludes consideration under Rule 60(b)(6).Child Support Enforcement Agency, 98 Hawai' i at 504, 51 P.3d at 371; see also
Self, 421 So.2d at 1281 (“In the instant case the relief sought falls clearlywithin the purview of either 60(b)(1) or (2) or (3). Hence, rule 60(b)(6)would not be available to the wife.”). 
-44­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
undue influence by Husband. Id. at 288, 666 P.2d at 173. The
 
ICA noted that relief under Rule 60(b)(6) requires that (1) “the
 
motion is based on some reason other than those specifically
 stated in clauses 60(b)(1) through (5);” (2) “there are
 exceptional circumstances justifying relief[;]” and (3) “the
 motion is made within a reasonable time.” Id. at 290, 666 P.2d
 
at 174-75. The ICA then went on to deny the relief requested
 because Wife’s petition did not sufficiently allege “exceptional
 circumstances” and, therefore, her six-year delay in filing the
 motion was unreasonable. Id. at 291, 666 P.2d at 175. Thus, the
 
ICA disposed of the Rule 60(b)(6) motion without addressing the
 requirement that “the motion [be] based on some reason other than
 those specifically stated in clauses 60(b)(1) through (5)[.]” 
Id. Accordingly, Hayashi does not answer whether “undue
 
influence” properly falls under the provisions of Rule 60(b)(3)
 or 60(b)(6), and Geraldine’s assertion that “[t]he ICA ignored
 Hayashi” is misplaced.
 
Finally, although Geraldine argued in the ICA that the
 
family court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing,
 she did not raise this issue in her application. Moreover, this
 argument is without merit. “The trial court may deny relief
 under Rule 60(b) without holding a hearing and may decide the
 issue on the basis of papers submitted.” Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at
 
293, 666 P.2d at 177 (citing Ahlo, 1 Haw. App. 324, 619 P.2d
 112). Although an evidentiary hearing may have proved useful in
 
-45­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
developing or substantiating Geraldine’s allegations, Geraldine
 
did not move for or otherwise request an evidentiary hearing, but
 advised the family court that she was pursuing the “labor
 intensive evidentiary part” in the circuit court in a related
 case. Inasmuch as Geraldine did not, at any point appearing in
 the record, request that the family court conduct an evidentiary
 hearing, we cannot hold that the family court erred in failing to
 do so. 
Accordingly, the ICA did not err in holding that the
 
family court did not abuse its discretion in denying Geraldine
 relief in this respect. 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the 11/28/03
 
Decree is not void under HFCR Rule 60(b)(4). We further hold
 that Geraldine’s claims of “fraud on the court” and “undue
 influence” are properly considered under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), and
 are therefore untimely. In light of these holdings, we need not
 address Geraldine’s arguments concerning estoppel or the proper
 standard of review for the family court’s FOFs. 
Accordingly, the May 3, 2010 judgment of the ICA is
 
affirmed.
