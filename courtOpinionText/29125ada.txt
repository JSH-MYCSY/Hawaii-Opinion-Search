CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0393(4))

RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, AND DUFFY, JJ.,
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE NACINO, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCY
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
Lopeti Lui Tuua (“Tuua”) was charged with assaulting a
 
bouncer with a beer bottle. 
At trial, Tuua’s half brother
 
testified that he, rather than Tuua, assaulted the bouncer. 
During closing argument, the deputy prosecuting attorney
 commented that if the jury believed Tuua’s half brother, no one
 would be convicted of assault. We hold that the deputy
 prosecuting attorney’s comments were improper, and that they may
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
have affected Tuua’s conviction. We therefore vacate Tuua’s
 
judgment and conviction and remand the matter to the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).

I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Trial
 
This case arose from an incident in which David Brown
 
(“Brown”), a bouncer, was struck with a beer bottle during a
 brawl at a bar. The pivotal issue at trial was who threw the
 bottle at Brown. The prosecution presented the testimony of the
 assaulted bouncer, Brown, another bouncer at the bar, Jason
 Inglish (“Inglish”), and a bartender, Renie Hamayelian
 (“Hamayelian”). All three testified that they were working on
 the night of the incident. Brown and Inglish testified that Tuua
 threw the bottle at Brown. Hamayelian testified that he and
 another customer collected the bottles when the fight broke out
 and Tuua was holding the only bottle they did not collect. 
Hamayelian saw the bottle in Tuua’s hand before it broke, and he
 saw the broken bottle nearby after it hit Brown, but did not see
 Tuua throw it. The parties entered a stipulation into the record
 that Officer Asbel Polanco would have testified that he took
 Brown’s statement on the night of the incident and Brown told him
 that Ikaika Kawai, a person Tuua was at the bar with, picked up a

bottle and hit Brown on the head with it. After the stipulation
 
was read into the record, the prosecution rested.
 
Tuua and his half brother, Brandon Carter (“Carter”),
 
testified that Carter threw the bottle that struck Brown. The
 defense rested, and the circuit court instructed the jury that:
 
Statements or remarks made by counsel are not
evidence. You should consider their arguments to you, but
you are not bound by their recollections or interpretations
of the evidence.
 
Directly before closing arguments, the circuit court
 
warned the jury that:
 
The  lawyers  will  now  make  their  closing  arguments.
  
What  they  say  is  not  evidence  and  you  are  not  bound  [by]  how
they  interpret  or  remember  the  evidence.   The  only  evidence
which  you  must  consider  in  deliberations  comes  from  the
witness’  testimony  and  from  the  exhibits  which  are  in
 
evidence.
 
During the prosecutor’s closing argument, he asserted
 
that Carter was not a credible witness because he was “diving on
 
the sword for his older brother. He’s trying to take
 responsibility.”
 
During the prosecution’s rebuttal argument, the
 
prosecutor made the following comments:
 
[Deputy  Prosecuting  Attorney  (“DPA”)]:   Now,  let’s
look  at  the  defense  that  the  defendant  is  trying  to  throw  at
 
you.   At  first  glance  it  seems  like  Brandon’s  testimony
seems  very  honorable.   It  seems  like  the  honorable  thing  to
 
do.   He’s  basically  diving  on  the  sword  for  his  brother,
saying  it  was  me.   I’m  responsible.   I’m  the  one  that  threw
 
the  beer  bottle.   But  in  reality  it’s  really  not  that
honorable  a  thing  to  do.   But  actually  what  it  is  is  a
desperate  attempt  to  get  his  brother  off  of  these  charges.
 
N
ow, a person might wonder, why is that? Because a
 
3
           
            
          
           
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
person might think, well, he’s admitting to a crime, so he
must be telling the truth. But is he really? Because you
think about it, the only person on trial today is this
defendant, Lopeti Tuua. Brandon Carter is not on trial. He
 can admit to anything and he won’t be convicted.
 
Now,  some  of  you  may  be  -- or  a  person  might  think,
well,  he  admitted  under  oath  that  he  threw  the  bottle.   So
 
if  we  find  Lopeti  not  guilty,  you  can  go  after  the  brother.
 
State v. Tuua, No. 29125 at 5 (App. Apr. 29, 2010) (mem.)
 
(emphasis added).
 
Defense counsel objected, and the circuit court
 
overruled the objection. The prosecutor continued:
 
[DPA]:   Going  back  to  the  strategy  of  the  defense,  if
you  found  the  defendant  not  guilty,  a  person  might  think,
well,  you  can  go  after  Brandon  Carter  because  he  admitted  to
it.
 
Think  about  it.   What  would  the  defense  attorney  of
 
Brandon  Carter  do?   He’d  call  every  one  of  the  State
 
witnesses.   He’d  call  Dave  Brown.   He’d  call  Renie
 
Hamaleyian  [sic]  and  he’d  call  Jason  Inglish.   Who  threw  the
 
bottle?   Each  of  them  would  say  it’s  Lopeti.   Each  one  of
 
them.
 
Brandon  Carter  could  get  up  on  the  stand  and  all  he’d
have  to  say  is,  I  lied.   And  then  what  would  happen?   Lopeti
 
would  have  been  found  not  guilty.   Defendant  would  have  been
 
found  not  guilty.   Could  have  just  said,  I  lied  under  oath.
 
So  what?
 
The  most  that  you  can  get  him  for  would  be  charging
him  for  lying  under  oath.   That  would  be  it  and  that’s  the
 
strategy,  and  that’s  why  you  can’t  really  give  any
credibility  to  Brandon  Carter  coming  in  here  today  and
saying,  hey,  it  was  me.   I  threw  the  bottle.   I  kind  of
 
threw  it  sideways,  and  it  kind  of  glanced  off  Dave’s  head
and  hit  the  wall  and  smashed.
 
Come  on,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  it’s  not  credible.
  
It’s  not  believable.   What  it  is  is  a  desperate  attempt  to
 
get  his  brother  off.   That’s  all  it  is.
 
The  bottom  line  in  this  case,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  is
that  the  right  person  who  threw  the  beer  bottle  on  March
13th,  2007  is  in  this  courtroom  and  he’s  sitting  right  here.
 
This  is  the  right  person.   Don’t  let  [Carter]  and  [Tuua]’s
scheme  confuse  you  or  cause  you  to  speculate  about  any  other
possibilities,  because  it  was  this  defendant  who  threw  the
 
4
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
beer bottle.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Tuua was subsequently found guilty and convicted of
 
Assault in the Second Degree in violation of HRS § 707-711(1)(d)
 
(Supp. 2006). Tuua was sentenced to imprisonment for 90 days and
 a five year term of probation.
 
B.	 The Intermediate Court of Appeals’ April 29, 2010
Memorandum Opinion
 
Tuua appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
 
raising three points of error: “(1) prior counsel’s failure to
 
timely file a notice of appeal constituted ineffective assistance
 of counsel, (2) the deputy prosecuting attorney (DPA) committed
 prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal argument, and (3)
 instructions regarding lesser included offenses should have been
 given sua sponte.” Tuua, mem. op. at 2.
 
With respect to the second point of error, the ICA
 
held that the prosecuting attorney’s comments were not improper. 
Id. at 8. The ICA held that, when taken “as a whole, the DPA’s
 argument was not an invitation to consider matters outside the
 record, nor did it state or imply that the DPA had special
 knowledge that the jury should rely upon.” Id. The ICA did “not
 
see this argument as an attempt to inflame the jury . . . .” Id. 
Tuua also asserted that “the DPA’s argument suggested
 
that Carter was lying and that Carter’s testimony was procured by
 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Tuua.” Id. The ICA held that the “the prosecution is entitled to 
argue that a witness is lying if the argument is based on the 
possible motivations of the witness and not the personal opinion of the prosecutor.” Id. (citing State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 
390, 425, 56 P.3d 692, 727 (2002); State v. Faluci, 917 A.2d 978, 988 (Conn. 2007)). The ICA observed that “[t]here was no statement of the DPA’s personal opinion and the DPA’s argument was directed towards the possible motivation behind Carter’s testimony, whether his testimony was altruistic or actually without consequences.” Id. 
With respect to Tuua’s argument regarding the
 
impermissible suggestion of collusion, the ICA held that the
 “DPA’s argument that Tuua and Carter had concocted a false story
 was based on a fair inference from the evidence” because “the
 testimony of Tuua and Carter conflicted with that of the State’s
 witnesses who identified Tuua as the person who threw the bottle
 at Brown.” Id. at 9.
 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s January 11, 2008,
 
judgment. Id. at 10.
 
On September 29, 2010, this court accepted a timely
 
application for a writ of certiorari filed by petitioner-
defendant-appellant Tuua, requesting that this court review the
 ICA’s May 20, 2010 judgment on appeal entered pursuant to its
 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
April 29, 2010 Memorandum Opinion affirming the circuit court’s
 
January 11, 2008 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence. Oral
 argument was held on November 4, 2010.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Application For Writ Of Certiorari
 
The acceptance or rejection of an application for writ
 
of certiorari is discretionary. HRS § 602-59(a) (Supp. 2009). 
“In deciding whether to accept an application, this court reviews
 the decisions of the ICA for (1) grave errors of law or of fact or
 (2) obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the ICA with that of the supreme court, federal decisions, or its own decisions and whether the magnitude of such errors or inconsistencies dictate the need for further appeal.” State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 
390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (citing HRS § 602-59(b)). 
B. Prosecutorial Misconduct
 
“Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed
 
under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which
 
requires an examination of the record and a determination of
 ‘whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error
 complained of might have contributed to the conviction.’” State
 
v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 1238 (1999) (block 
quote formatting omitted) (quoting State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 
325, 329 n.6, 966 P.2d 637, 641 n.6 (1998)). “Factors to consider 
7
           
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
are: (1) the nature of the conduct; (2) the promptness of a
 
curative instruction; and (3) the strength or weakness of the
 evidence against the defendant.” Id.
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Deputy Prosecuting Attorney’s Comments Were
Improper.
 
Tuua asserts that the prosecutor’s comments constituted
 
prosecutorial misconduct because: 1) the prosecutor suggested
 
that Tuua procured Carter’s dishonesty without evidence in the
 record to support that inference; 2) the deputy prosecuting
 attorney made a “personal comment” and suggested his opinion; 3)
 the prosecutor’s comments inflamed “the passions and prejudice” of
 the jury; and 4) the prosecutor’s suggestion that no one will be
 prosecuted for the crime was improper. We hold that the
 prosecutor’s comments were improper because the prosecutor
 commented on the consequences of the jury’s verdict and matters
 not in evidence.
2
 
This court evaluates claims of improper statements by 
prosecutors by first determining whether the statements are improper, and then determining whether the misconduct is harmless. State v. Kiakona, 110 Hawai' i 450, 458, 134 P.3d 616, 624 (App. 
2006) (citing State v. McGriff, 76 Hawai' i 148, 160, 871 P.2d 782, 
2
 Because we reach this conclusion, it is not necessary to address
 
Tuua’s remaining claims of impropriety.

794 (1994); State v. Lincoln, 3 Haw. App. 107, 125, 643 P.2d 807, 
820 (1982)). During closing argument, a prosecutor “is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence.” State v. Clark, 83 
Hawai'i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (citing State v. 
Apilando, 79 Hawai' i 128, 141, 900 P.2d 135, 148 (1995)). 
“Although a prosecutor has wide latitude in commenting on the evidence during closing argument, it is not enough that a [sic] his comments are based on testimony ‘in evidence’; his comments must also be ‘legitimate.’” State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i 235, 
253, 178 P.3d 1, 19 (2008) (quoting Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304, 926 
P.2d at 209). “A prosecutor’s comments are legitimate when they draw ‘reasonable’ inferences from the evidence.” Id. at 253-54, 
178 P.3d at 19-20 (quoting State v. Iuli, 101 Hawai' i 196, 208, 65 
P.3d 143, 155 (2003)). Finally, it is “generally recognized under Hawai'i case law that prosecutors are bound to refrain from 
expressing their personal views as to a defendant’s guilt or the credibility of witnesses.” State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 
424-25, 56 P.3d 692, 726-27 (2002) (block quote formatting omitted) (quoting Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209). 
Under the foregoing standard, the prosecutor’s comments
 
were improper because the prosecutor commented on matters outside
 the evidence adduced at trial. As noted above, prosecutors are
 
9
          
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. 
Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i at 253-54, 178 P.3d at 19-20; State v. 
Carvalho, 106 Hawai' i 13, 18, 100 P.3d 607, 612 (App. 2004) (block 
quote formatting omitted) (quoting Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304-05, 
926 P.2d at 209-10). In this case, the prosecutor went beyond the record and discussed the consequences of the jury’s verdict. For instance, the prosecutor commented that, in Carter’s hypothetical future trial, every one of the prosecution’s witnesses in Tuua’s trial would testify that Tuua threw the bottle. Drawing on this hypothetical, the prosecutor argued that believing Carter would result in the acquittal of both Tuua and Carter on the assault charge. The prosecutor stated that the “most that you can get [Carter] for would be charging him for lying under oath. That would be it and that’s the strategy, and that’s why you can’t really give any credibility to Brandon Carter coming in here today and saying, hey, it was me.” The prosecutor’s comments did not draw legitimate inferences from the testimony adduced at trial and were therefore improper. 
In State v. Sanchez, the ICA confronted a similar 
comment and held that the prosecutor’s statement was improper. 82 Hawai'i 517, 533, 923 P.2d 934, 950 (App. 1996). The prosecutor 
stated to the jury: 
Do not, do not reward their lies with an acquittal.
Please do not. That’s what you’re doing. You know what
 
10
          
           
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
happens after that, then the group gets together again and
they say, boy, it worked. We sure fooled that jury didn’t
 we? No, they didn’t . . . .
 
Id. at 532 n.20, 923 P.2d at 949 n.20 (emphasis added).
 
The ICA held that the prosecutor’s comment was improper
 
because it “improperly ‘direct[ed] the jury from its duty to
 
decide the case on the evidence . . . by making predictions of the
 consequences of the jury’s verdict.’” Id. at 533, 923 P.2d at 950 
(emphasis added) (quoting 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice,
 The Prosecution Function, Standard 3-5.8(d) (2d ed. 1986)). The
 ICA held that by branding the jury members as “fools”
 the argument undermined “the proposition that the prosecutor
 should refrain from argument diverting the jury from concentrating
 on the evidence.” Id.
 
Although the statement in Sanchez differs from the
 
statement in this case, the reasoning in Sanchez applies. In the
 instant case, the prosecutor framed his argument by referring to
 the consequences of failing to convict Tuua.
 
Before the ICA, the prosecution asserted that “the
 
prosecutor’s rebuttal comments on the strategy behind Carter’s
 testimony were part of the overall closing argument evaluating the
 credibility of the witnesses . . . .” The prosecution
 characterized the deputy prosecuting attorney’s argument as
 continuing to “theorize” why Carter would take the blame for the
 
11
          
           
           
   
        
           
          
          
          
         
        
         
          
               
         
              
             
           
          
              
         
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
incident. The prosecution analogized Hawai' i cases holding that a 
prosecutor may argue the credibility of witnesses. (Citing
 
Carvalho, 106 Hawai' i at 17, 100 P.3d at 611 (holding that 
prosecutor’s statement that “either you can believe Richard
 Melcher about what happened or you can believe Melanie Yuson and
 [the defendant]” was not improper.))
3
 
This argument is unpersuasive because a plain reading of
 
the prosecutor’s rebuttal indicates that he went beyond attacking
 Carter’s credibility based on the evidence adduced at trial. The
 prosecution correctly observes that the deputy prosecuting
 attorney argued a legitimate inference from the evidence that
 Carter was “diving on the sword” for his brother Tuua and could
 
3 Before the ICA, the prosecution also asserted that State v. 
Valdivia , 95 Hawai 'i 465, 484, 24 P.3d 661, 680 (2001), supports concluding
that the prosecutor’s comment was not improper. In Valdivia , the prosecutor 
made the following statement: 
Ladies and gentlemen, these charges are not trumped up
because officers are lying or that this is some blue wall of
conduct, that they’re trying to get even for what this guy
did to some of their officers. Remember, the person he
almost killed was the person that was in that green car.
Maybe he should have been charged with attempted murder.
 
Id. at 483, 24 P.3d at 679 (emphasis added).
 
The ICA held that the prosecutor’s comment that “that Valdivia 
should have been charged with attempted murder” was “flagrantly improper.” Id. With respect to the “blue wall of conduct” comment, the ICA held that “it 
was not an improper assertion of personal opinion regarding Valdivia’scredibility.” Id. at 484, 24 P.3d at 680 (citing Clark, 83 Hawai 'i at 304-06, 
926 P.2d at 209-11). The statement in Valdivia differs from the statement in 
this case. Additionally, the portion of Valdivia that the prosecution cites
to concerns whether a statement expresses the prosecutor’s personal opinion.(Citing Valdivia , 95 Hawai 'i at 484, 24 P.3d at 680.) In light of our
conclusion that the prosecutor’s comment improperly discusses matters not inevidence, Valdivia is not persuasive. 
12
         
         
          
          
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
not be prosecuted in the instant case. However, the prosecuting
 
attorney went beyond inferring that Carter was not credible from
 evidence in the record by focusing on whether Carter could be
 prosecuted in a subsequent proceeding. For instance, the deputy
 prosecuting attorney explained his comments during a bench
 conference as:
 
It’s a strategy on [sic] the defense that they’re
going to basically, if they find [Tuua] not guilty, you
know, a person might think you could go after [Carter], but
then, of course, all the State witnesses could be used by
the defense to say, well, hell, it was [Tuua] that threw the
bottle.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Viewed in this light, the prosecuting attorney’s
 
comments about Carter’s potential trial and that the “most you can
 
get [Carter] for would be charging him for lying under oath” were
 not based on the evidence in the record. Although the prosecutor
 couched his argument as an attack on Carter’s credibility, the
 prosecutor’s argument discussed the consequences of the jury’s
 verdict. Therefore, the prosecutor’s comment was improper.
 
B. The Improper Comment Was Not Harmless.
 
Tuua asserts that the deputy prosecuting attorney’s
 
improper statement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Before the ICA, the prosecution did not specifically argue that
 the prosecutor’s error was harmless, but “noted that . . . the
 trial court sufficiently instructed the jury that closing argument
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
was not evidence.” To the extent that the prosecution has
 
preserved and is arguing harmless error, this argument is
 unpersuasive.
 
Hawai'i courts evaluate the following criteria in 
assessing whether a prosecutor’s improper comments are harmless: “(1) the nature of the conduct; (2) the promptness of a curative instruction; and (3) the strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant.” Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i at 252, 178 P.3d 
at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Hauge, 103 Hawai' i 38, 47, 79 P.3d 131, 140 (2003)). An improper comment 
warrants a new trial if “there is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have contributed to the conviction.” See Hauge, 103 Hawai' i at 47, 79 P.3d at 140 (internal quotation 
marks and block quote formatting omitted) (quoting State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i 83, 93, 26 P.3d 572, 582 (2001)). 
1. Nature of the conduct
 As discussed above, the first factor weighs against 
concluding that the deputy prosecuting attorney’s comment was harmless because the prosecutor commented on the consequences of the jury’s verdict and matters not in evidence. This court evaluates the severity of the conduct in determining whether the first factor favors holding that an improper statement was harmless. See State v. Maluia, 107 Hawai' i 20, 27, 108 P.3d 974, 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
981 (2005). For instance, in Maluia, this court held that a
 
prosecutor’s question asking the witness to comment on the
 veracity of other witnesses was harmless. Id. This court held
 
that:
 
the  conduct  was  less  egregious  than  that  presented  in
those  cases  where  we  vacated  the  defendants’  convictions  and
 
remanded  for  new  trials.   See,  e.g.,  State  v.  Wakisaka,  102
 
Hawai'i  504,  78  P.3d  317  (2003)  (vacating  and  remanding
where  the  prosecution  improperly  commented  on  the
defendant’s  failure  to  testify);  State  v.  Pacheco,  96
Hawai'i  83,  95,  26  P.3d  572,  584  (2001)  (vacating  and
remanding  where  “the  [prosecution’s]  characterization  of
[the  defendant]  as  an  ‘asshole’  strongly  conveyed  his
personal  opinion  and  could  only  have  been  calculated  to
inflame  the  passions  of  the  jurors  and  to  divert  them,  by
injecting  an  issue  wholly  unrelated  to  [the  defendant’s]
guilt  or  innocence  into  their  deliberations,  from  their  duty
to  decide  the  case  on  the  evidence”);  State  v.  Marsh,  68
Haw.  659,  728  P.2d  1301  (1986)  (vacating  and  remanding  where
the  prosecutor,  in  closing,  repeatedly  stated  her  personal
belief  that  the  defendant  was  guilty).
 
Id.
 
Although Maluia suggests that the prosecutor’s comment
 
in the instant case was not as egregious as some of the other
 conduct this court has held non-prejudicial, the prosecuting
 attorney’s conduct here was more egregious than the question posed
 by the prosecutor in Maluia. The comment directed the jury’s
 attention away from the evidence and to impermissible
 considerations of the consequences of its verdict. Therefore, the
 first factor weighs in favor of holding that the error was not
 harmless.

2. Promptness of a curative instruction
 
The circuit court did not issue a curative instruction. 
Although the circuit court twice instructed the jury that arguments of counsel were not evidence, it overruled Tuua’s objection and did not issue a curative instruction after the improper statement. See Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i at 255, 178 P.3d 
at 21 (holding that the circuit court’s failure to issue a curative instruction regarding the prosecutor’s comment weighed in favor of concluding that the comment was not harmless); State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 415, 984 P.2d 1231, 1241 (1999) (“[I]t is 
unlikely that the circuit court’s general instructions that were delivered well after the inflammatory comments along with the other general jury instructions could have negated the prejudicial effect of the deputy prosecutor’s comments.”) (citing State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1303 (1986)); Marsh, 68 Haw. at 661, 728 P.2d at 1303 (holding that a prosecutor’s comments were not harmless in part because “the court was not requested to and did not issue a specific instruction concerning the prosecutor’s closing comments”). 
Before the ICA, the prosecution asserted that State v.
 
Carvalho indicates that the trial court “sufficiently instructed
 the jury that closing argument was not evidence.” (Citing State
 v. Carvalho, 106 Hawai' i 13, 18, 100 P.3d 607, 612 (App. 2004.))

In Carvalho, the trial court instructed the jury twice that 
arguments and statements of counsel are not evidence. Carvalho, 
106 Hawai' i at 19, 100 P.3d at 613. The prosecution observes that 
in Carvalho, the ICA presumed the jury followed the court’s instructions and stated that if “prophylactic was necessary in this case, surely these instructions provided some good measure of inoculation.” Id. (citing State v. Meyer, 99 Hawai' i 168, 172-73, 
53 P.3d 307, 311-12 (2002)). Although the defendant claimed that the prosecutor’s comments distorted its burden of proof, the ICA stated that “the jury . . . was well instructed on ‘what [it] must find in order to reach a certain verdict.’” Id. at 18, 100 P.3d 
at 612 (quoting United States v. Vargas, 583 F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir. 1978)). Carvalho is distinguishable because jury 
instructions regarding the prosecution’s burden of proof were given in addition to instructions informing the jury that arguments are not evidence. Id. at 18-19, 100 P.3d at 612-13. 
Additionally, the prosecution has not pointed to Hawai' i case law 
suggesting that a court’s generic instructions that arguments of counsel are not evidence, issued prior to improper statements, can cure misconduct in close cases involving the credibility of witnesses. See infra at 18; Marsh, 68 Haw. at 661, 728 P.2d at 
1302-03. Therefore, the circuit court’s failure to give a curative instruction weighs against holding that the prosecutor’s

comment was harmless.
 
3. The strength or weakness of the evidence
 
In close cases involving the credibility of witnesses, 
particularly where there are no disinterested witnesses or other corroborating evidence, this court has been reluctant to hold improper statements harmless. Compare Maluia, 107 Hawai' i at 27, 
108 P.3d at 981 (noting that “the prosecutorial misconduct in the instant case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt” where “[t]he evidence against the defendant included two eyewitness accounts from witnesses unconnected to the defendant or the victim [and] also showed that the defendant’s BAC was 0.131, raising additional doubts as to the defendant’s credibility”), with Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 
at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241 (holding that the evidence did not outweigh the inflammatory effect of the prosecutor’s comments, where the case “turned on the credibility of two witnesses” and “[t]here were no independent eyewitnesses or conclusive forensic evidence”). 
In this case, the credibility of the witnesses was
 
pivotal. The critical issue at trial was who threw the bottle and
 there was conflicting testimony in this regard. Because this was
 a case involving the credibility of witnesses, each of whom
 arguably had a potential interest or bias, it weighs against
 holding that the improper statement was harmless.

An evaluation of the three factors reveals that there is
 
a reasonable possibility that the prosecutor’s improper comment
 
might have affected the conviction because: 1) the prosecutor’s
 improper comment discussed the consequences of the jury’s verdict
 and matters not in evidence; 2) the trial court did not issue a
 curative instruction; and 3) the strength of the evidence was not
 overwhelming and the credibility of the witnesses’ versions of
 events was the pivotal issue at trial.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based upon the foregoing analysis, we vacate the ICA’s
 
judgment on appeal, and remand to the circuit court for a new
 trial.
