STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
ROBERT JAMES BEHRENDT aka RUNNING BEAR,
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
NO. 29191
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CR NO. 07-1-0061K)
 
AUGUST 19, 2010
 
MOON, C.J., NAKAYAMA, DUFFY, AND RECKTENWALD, JJ.;
WITH ACOBA, J., DISSENTING
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, J.
 
Defendant Robert Behrendt, also known as Running Bear, 
was convicted of sexual assault for conduct involving SI, a minor 
under the age of 16. We must decide whether evidence of sexual contacts between Behrendt and SI that occurred prior to the conduct charged in this case was admissible under Hawai
'i Rules 
of Evidence (HRE) Rules 404(b) and 403, cited infra. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the Circuit Court of 
1
the Third Circuit  did not err in admitting that evidence.
 SI grew up in Kona, Hawai 'i, but moved to South Dakota 
when she was 11 to live with Behrendt and her sister, LI, who was 
1
 The Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance presided.
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
married to Behrendt. The evidence presented by the State of 
Hawai» i at trial established that after SI arrived in South 
Dakota, Behrendt suggested that SI shower with him when they were alone. SI refused initially, but subsequently agreed. Behrendt 
had SI touch him sexually during these showers, and also touched 
SI. Eventually, they began to have intercourse, and Behrendt 
told SI not to tell anyone. SI, who was confused and frightened by what was happening, complied with that request. 
When SI was 14, she returned to Kona with Behrendt and
 
LI. Behrendt and SI continued to have sexual relations. SI 
eventually broke off her sexual relationship with Behrendt, but did not report it to police until more than a year later. Behrendt was subsequently indicted for three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of Hawai» i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(c) (Supp. 2006)
2 for the conduct 
which occurred in Kona. The indictment grouped the three counts 
based on the time periods in which SI lived at three different 
houses in Kona: (1) Count 1: the Kamani Trees house, covering the 
period from September 2002 through February 2003, (2) Count 2: the Aloha Kona house, covering the period from February 2003 through May 2004; and (3) Count 3: the Pumehana house, covering 
the period from May 2004 through August 2004.  Behrendt was also

 HRS ÿÿ 707-730(1)(c) (Supp. 2006) provides that a person engages in
first degree sexual assault when [t]he person knowingly engages in sexual
penetration with a person who is at least fourteen years old but less than
sixteen old; provided that: (i) The person is not less than five years older
than the minor; and (ii) The person is not legally married to the minor;
. . . . 
 
2
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
indicted for kidnapping in violation of HRS § 707-720(1)(d) & (e)
 
(1993)3 (Count 4) with respect to an incident that occurred in
 
January 2005.
 
Behrendt moved in limine to exclude testimony
 
concerning the instances of sexual contact that occurred while SI
 
was living in South Dakota.4 The circuit court held that the
 
evidence was probative of motive, opportunity and plan, and that
 
its probative value was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. 
A jury found Behrendt guilty of the lesser included offense of
 
sexual assault in the third degree in violation of HRS § 707-732
 
(Supp. 2006)
5 on Counts 1-3, and the lesser included offense of
 
unlawful imprisonment in the first degree in violation of HRS §
 
707-721 (1993)6 on Count 4.  In a summary disposition order
 
(SDO), the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the
 
3 HRS § 707-720(1) (1993) provides, in relevant part, that [a]
person commits the offense of kidnapping if the person intentionally or
knowingly restrains another person with intent to: . . . (d) Inflict bodily
injury upon that person or subject that person to a sexual offense; (e)
Terrorize that person or a third person; . . . . 
 
4
 There was also some evidence of sexual contacts which occurred
 
while SI was traveling with LI and Behrendt elsewhere on the mainland,
including Washington state. For ease of reference, we will refer to these
events collectively as the South Dakota evidence. 
5 HRS ÿÿ 707-732(1)(c) (Supp. 2006) provides that a person engages in
third degree sexual assault when [t]he person knowingly engages in sexual
contact with a person who is at least fourteen years old but less than sixteen
years old; provided that: (i) The person is not less than five years older
than the minor; and (ii) The person is not legally married to the minor;
. . . . 
 
6
 HRS § 707-721 (1993) provides, in relevant part, that [a] person
commits the offense of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree if the person
knowingly restrains another person: (a) Under circumstances which expose the
person to the risk of serious bodily injury; or (b) In a condition of
involuntary servitude. 
 
3
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
convictions on Counts 1, 2, and 4, but vacated the conviction on
 
Count 3 because the circuit court did not properly instruct the
 
jury on the law applicable to Count 3 at the time of the offense.
 
In his application for a writ of certiorari 
(application), Behrendt argues that the circuit court erred in 
admitting the South Dakota evidence. However, we agree with the 
circuit court that the evidence was probative of Behrendt s opportunity to commit the offenses in Hawai» i without being 
detected. Moreover, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the admission of the evidence 
would not unduly prejudice Behrendt. 
Behrendt also argues that the circuit court erred in
 
instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of sexual
 
assault in the third degree, and that there was insufficient
 evidence to support the convictions on Counts 1-3 because the
 
evidence referred only to sexual penetration, rather than sexual
 
contact.  However, for the reasons set forth below, we reject
 
those arguments.
 
Accordingly, we affirm the ICA s November 24, 2009
 
judgment. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Pre-trial Proceedings Regarding Other Acts Evidence
 
The State filed a Notice of Intent to Use Specified
 
Evidence, to give[] notice that the State intends to present
 
evidence relating to [Behrendt s] pattern of threats to [SI], and
 
4
  
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the grooming and ongoing nature/length of their relationship."
 
The State attached police reports that contained allegations of
 
sexual contacts in South Dakota.  In response, Behrendt filed a
 
motion in limine, arguing that the evidence was inadmissible
 
under HRE Rules 401, 403 and 404. He also asserted that SI was
 fabricating the allegations because Behrendt and LI were in the
 
middle of a divorce and custody dispute over their daughter.
 
The circuit court granted Behrendt s motion without
 
prejudice, explaining that the State did not clearly identify all
 
the prior bad act evidence it intended to offer in its case-in­
chief or explain how it was relevant, and did not analyze the
 balancing of probative value versus prejudicial effect.
 
The State filed an amended notice and motion to
 
reconsider. The State included detailed descriptions of the
 
expected testimony of each proposed witness, and argued that the
 
evidence of the prior acts was relevant to show the defendant s
 motive, purpose and intent; to show opportunity; and to show why
 
[SI] did not, for years, disclose the abuse.  Additionally, the
 
State explained why each witnesses  testimony was relevant, and
 analyzed its admissibility under HRE Rule 403.  Behrendt filed an
 
opposition arguing, inter alia, that there are 23 months of
 
context in Hawaii, which is abundantly sufficient to establish
 
context.  
The circuit court granted in part and denied in part
 
the State s motion for reconsideration.  The circuit court
 
5
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rejected the State s argument that prior bad act evidence is
 
always relevant to explain the context of the relationship
 
between the defendant and complaining witness, and concluded that
 
the expected testimony of two of the State s witnesses7 was not
 
admissible because the probative value did not outweigh the
 prejudicial effect and the State s offer of proof was vague and
 
cumulative.  The circuit court s order additionally provided, in
 
relevant part:
 
The court grants that portion of State s Motion
to Reconsider admission of testimony concerning other
 
acts  that allegedly occurred outside of the State of
Hawaii as follows. The Court concludes that the issue
 
of delayed reporting  is squarely before the jury, as
well as possible issues of consent concerning the
kidnapping charge. The Court finds that the  other bad
 
acts  allegedly committed outside of the State of
Hawaii as described by [SI], [LI] and [LI s friend,
Trista], are relevant to show motive, opportunity and
plan.
 
The court having concluded that the testimony is
relevant, next balances whether relevant evidence
should be excluded because its probative value is
substantially outweighed by other factors, including
danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues or
misleading the jury, pursuant to Rule 403, [HRE].
 
Specific factors that the court has considered
in the Rule 403 analysis in deciding whether to admit
other acts , include the strength of evidence of the
prior act, the time elapsed between the prior and
[sic] crimes charged, the need for the other acts,
efficacy of alternative proof, and whether the other
acts are likely to raise overmastering hostility. The
 
Court concludes that the prejudice of admitting the
testimony of [SI], [LI] and [LI s friend, Trista],
does not outweigh the relevance, and that a cautionary
instruction ameliorates any prejudice.
 
. . . .
 
III. OTHER BAD ACTS OCCURRING IN HAWAII.
 
The court finds that most of the witnesses who
 
7
 The witnesses, cousins of SI and LI, were expected to testify that
Behrendt, SI, and LI visited them in 2002 before their return to Hawaii, and
[Behrendt] seemed unusually physical with [SI.] 
 
6
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
8Behrendt is twelve years older than SI, and LI is eleven years
older than SI.
7will testify to the relationship between the defendant
and the complaining witness will present testimony
that could be considered “other bad acts”.  Many are
family and friends who may have been in close contact
with the defendant and minor, several living in the
same household.  Some of the testimony describes acts,
such as holding hands and kissing, that could be
considered either innocent or a “bad act”.
The court finds and concludes that the testimony
of the following witnesses concerning “other acts” or
“bad acts” that happened in Hawaii is relevant to
motive, opportunity, intent and plan[.]  The court
further finds that the probative value is not
“substantially outweighed” by other factors, including
danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues or
misleading the jury.  The court finds that a
cautionary instruction ameliorates any
prejudice. . . .

B. Trial
The relevant evidence at trial was, in summary, as
follows.
1. State’s Case
a. SI’s Testimony
(1)  South Dakota 
In November of 1999, when SI was eleven years old, she
moved out of her parents’ home in Kona and went to live with LI
and Behrendt in South Dakota.8  SI testified that in South
Dakota, Behrendt would take her to school every day, pick her up
in the afternoon and take her back to the apartment, and they
would talk and play video games while LI was still at work.
Behrendt would talk with SI about “other boys” and said,
“[y]ou’ll soon have a boyfriend.”  After living there for a few ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
months, SI and Behrendt went to the pool one day, and when they
 
got home [Behrendt] asked [her] to take off [her] clothes, and
 
[] take a shower together[,]  but SI refused. The next time they
 
went to the pool, however, Behrendt told SI that it was okay 
 
for her to shower with him and that he had asked LI and that she
 
said it was okay.  After that, SI trusted him  and showered
 
with Behrendt while both of them were naked, and [Behrendt]
 would be erect sometimes, and he would tell me to grab onto him,
 grab onto his dick.  SI testified that their showers eventually
 progressed to the point where Behrendt would touch SI s genitalia
 
and insert his penis into her genitalia. She was afraid to tell
 
him no [b]ecause he was an adult  and had told her that it was
 okay.  SI testified that she and Behrendt also had sexual
 contact  elsewhere in the apartment, and that Behrendt showed SI
 a videotape of pornography. SI testified that they had sex
 [o]ften  in South Dakota, and that she remembered it being more frequent than when they later returned to Hawai» i. 
During the first few months of these sexual encounters,
 
SI felt like [she] loved [Behrendt] as a brother. But then [she]
 just . . . knew that there was something wrong. But [she] was
 confused  and would push[] him off a lot  and be rude to him. 
 SI also testified that after about the tenth time she and
 
Behrendt had sex, he told her not to tell LI and that if she told
 he would end up going to jail.   SI testified it seemed like
 
[Behrendt] was changing it to be like a relationship  and was
 
8
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
thinking of [her] as a girlfriend  but that she was annoyed by it
 
and didn t want him. 
 
SI also recalled a time when she attended a going-away
 
party at the home of LI s friend Trista, and she and Behrendt
 
were sitting outside when a boy walked by whom SI identified as
 her boyfriend  and this made Behrendt mad.  Later on she and
 
Behrendt went into the bathroom together, and he kissed her. He
 said, [l]et s do it inside the bathroom,  but SI told him no.
 Behrendt got upset  and ended up head-butting the wall[.] 
 
SI testified that she did not confide in her sister
 
when they lived in South Dakota because she was scared  and
 [LI] always seemed happy, so I also felt guilt that I would have
 
ruined her life.  SI recalled that LI had asked her if Behrendt
 
was touching SI like their uncle had,
9 but SI just shook her head
 
and said nothing.
 
(2) Return to Hawai» i 
Behrendt, LI and SI returned to Hawai» i in September 
2002, when SI was fourteen years old.  SI testified that around
 
that time, she started liking [Behrendt], because he was there 
for [her]  and they had a [f]riendship  where SI told him 
everything[,]  he bought her things and would stick up for her. 
SI was home schooled in Hawai» i, and Behrendt was the only person 
9
 SI testified that when she was in 3rd or 4th grade, she told a
teacher at school that her uncle had molested her when she was four or five. 
LI also testified that the same uncle molested LI when LI was six. After SI
 was molested, SI received counseling.
 
9
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
10SI got along with because her family “was broken apart” and
“didn’t get along.”
(a)  Kamani Trees (Count 1)
SI, Behrendt and LI moved into the Kamani Trees house,
along with SI’s parents, her older brother (Brother) and
Brother’s children.   During this time, SI slept in the same bed
as LI and Behrendt.  SI and Behrendt continued to have sexual
intercourse approximately three to five times per month in both
the bedroom and the bathroom.  SI specifically recounted the
first time they had intercourse at Kamani Trees, in which
Behrendt “turned [her] around and [] had sexual intercourse with
[her] in the back[,]” while LI slept next to them.  SI also
testified that they also had oral sex “[a]nytime [they] would
have sexual intercourse[,]” where she “would just lick him or []
would suck on his dick.”
(b)  Aloha Kona house (Count 2)
SI, Behrendt, and LI next lived at the Aloha Kona house
from February 2003 until April or May 2004, with SI’s parents,
Brother and Brother’s children.  SI’s bedroom consisted of a
curtained-off area of the living room.  Behrendt would come into
her bedroom early in the morning, SI would braid his hair, she
and Behrendt would talk and he would tell SI “[h]ow much he loved
[her].”  They continued to have sexual intercourse once or twice
a week in SI’s curtained-off room and sometimes in the bedroom
Behrendt and LI shared.  Behrendt would also drive SI to a nearby 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
construction site and they had sex in the back of the car.
 
SI and LI hardly spoke because they were fighting
 
[for] attention from Bear  and [LI] had a feeling of something
 
that was going on between the two of us.  Behrendt, who was of
 
Native American ancestry, told SI to call him [h]igna[,]  which
 
was the Lakota name for husband.  Behrendt told SI that in his
 
Lakota culture, they had two wives  who were sisters. SI felt
 like that [Behrendt] could be my husband. That I loved him. And
 . . . I was confused. 
 
After living in the Aloha Kona house, SI moved with her
 
parents, LI and Behrendt to a house on Painted Church Road in
 Kona, and she and Behrendt had sexual intercourse in one of the
 
rooms of the house. 
(c) Pumehana House (Count 3)
 
In May 2004, when SI was fifteen years old, LI,
 
Behrendt, and SI moved into the Pumehana House, along with SI and
 LI s parents, Brother, and Brother s children, and lived there
 
until November 2004. SI and Behrendt continued to have sexual
 
intercourse about once a month. Again, a curtained-off area
 
served as SI s bedroom, and SI continued to braid Behrendt s hair
 
and then he would want to have a quickie or something.  They
 
would also have sex in rental cars from Behrendt s workplace,
 SI s mother s car, and once at a storage place nearby where
 Behrendt had SI bent over the back seat[.]  Also, about one
 
month before SI s sixteenth birthday, Behrendt took her in a
 
11
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rental car to a construction site in Kaloko, they had sexual
 
intercourse, and Behrendt asked her if she wanted to have anal
 
intercourse and she [s]hrugged.  Behrendt then attempt[ed] it 
 
and put his penis in [her] anal, [her] butt. 
 
(d) Gabby s House & Crazy Horse Apartments
 
SI testified that four or five months after she turned
 
sixteen, she moved out of the Pumehana house and in with a
 
friend, Gabby, and Gabby s father for a few months until her
 family drama  cooled down.  At this time, LI moved to the
 
mainland, and Behrendt moved out of the Pumehana house and into
 
the Crazy Horse Apartments in Kona.  SI moved in with Behrendt,
 
and started dating a boy named Brandon. She and Behrendt had
 
arguments about Brandon because [Behrendt] didn t want [her] to
 
be going out with [him]. 
 
(e) January 17, 2005 incident (Count 4)
 
SI testified that she had a disagreement with Behrendt
 
on January 17, 2005 in the Crazy Horse apartment after SI told
 
him that she didn t want to have sex with him anymore because she
 
was dating Brandon.  SI tried to get out of the apartment but
 
Behrendt pulled [her] back and threw [her] to the ground  and
 straddled [her] down.   SI screamed and tried to break free, but
 
Behrendt told her to [b]e quiet[,]  slapped her on the face and
 
arm, unzipped himself and [] took out his penis[,]  and told SI
 
he was going to get her pregnant.  SI eventually ran out of the
 
apartment, but Behrendt brought her back.  They got into
 
12
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Behrendt s car and continued to struggle, and Behrendt slapped
 
her. SI testified that she was scared that Behrendt may kill
 
her.  Finally, Behrendt dropped SI off at Gabby s house, SI
 
called Brandon to pick her up, and Brandon s parents called the
 
police. 
SI testified that the police arrived a day and a half
 
later in response to SI being reported a runaway, and took SI to
 
the station.
 She told police Behrendt hit her and that she had
 
bruises on her arm and her ribs hurt, but did not tell them about
 
their sexual relationship because she didn t want him to go to
 jail. 
 
(f) Alleged abuse reported
 
On March 22, 2006, Behrendt came into Jamba Juice where
 
SI worked, and when SI saw him, she became upset. SI s boss
 asked her what was wrong, and SI told her about her sexual
 
history and relationship with Behrendt. SI next told LI, who
 went to the police.
 
b. LI s Testimony
10
 
(1) South Dakota
 
10 Prior to LI s testimony, which preceded SI s testimony, the
circuit court gave the following cautionary instruction:
 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are about to
hear evidence that the defendant may have engaged in
other crimes, wrongs, or acts. You must not use this
evidence to determine that the defendant is a person
of bad character and, therefore, must have committed
the offenses charged in this case. Such evidence may
be considered by you only on the issues of defendant s
motive, opportunity, and intent and for no other
purpose.
 
13
  
 
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
LI testified that Behrendt would spend time with SI at
 
home until LI returned from work each day. Behrendt told LI that
 
he took showers with SI at their apartment, and LI told him it
 
was inappropriate for him to be doing that with her.   Behrendt
 
responded that it was okay.  LI also observed SI and Behrendt
 horse-playing around  one day at their apartment:
 
[SI] ended up underneath him, and he was on top of
her, with - you know, just the way how they were like
looking at each other like made me kind of feel
uncomfortable and that he was like - the way how he
was stroking her hair back just made me very
uncomfortable like, you know, why are they acting like
that towards each other, you know.
 
LI did not confront Behrendt about this incident
 
because she was scared. 
 
LI recounted a time when they went to a party at her
 
friend Trista s house and Behrendt all of a sudden [] just kind
 
of got upset  and was acting really jealous.  Then he and SI
 
went upstairs to the bathroom for about thirty minutes. After
 
they came out, LI noticed that there was a hole in the wall in
 
the bathroom, that SI had a red mark  that looked like a
 
hickey  and was very upset.  LI confronted Behrendt about it
 
and he told her that he accidentally grabbed [SI] by the
 
neck[.] 
 
LI also recalled an incident when they were on their 
way back to Hawai» i and staying at a cousin s house in 
Washington. LI testified that LI, Behrendt and SI were sleeping next to each other on the floor one night, and SI and Behrendt 
14
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
. . . started acting kind of weird with each
other. So I kind of stayed up so where to see how they
would act towards each other. And during this night I
heard  it was pitch black, and I heard him say get on
top. And she s like, no. And I was just wondering like
what are they talking about, you know.
And then I saw her on top. And then I was like,
what are they doing, you know. In my mind I was
thinking like why are they  what are they doing, you
know. And so  and then all I hear her say was ouch.
And I m like, What s going on? So I put my arm around
him, and so - and all he could do was like just move
my arm[.]
 
LI did not confront Behrendt because she was scared of
 
the fact of what was happening  and didn t know what to do at
 
that time[.]  LI confronted SI the next morning, but SI told her
 
that nothing was going on.
 
LI further testified that SI would call Behrendt higna,
 
which meant husband in Lakota. When LI talked to Behrendt about
 his interactions with SI, he would yell at her and tell her that
 she was selfish  and a bitch for interfering.  LI testified
 
that [Behrendt] told me a long time ago that when he gets
 
married to me or if I had a sister or someone younger than I am,
 he would take em as a wife. 
 
(2) Hawai» i 
LI testified that when she and Behrendt lived at the
 
Kamani Trees house, SI would sleep in bed with them. [Behrendt]
 was starting to act very jealous  and he and SI were always
 
together and were still taking showers together.  When LI
 
talked to Behrendt about taking showers with SI, he got upset
 
with me and grabbed me by the arm and started shaking me and
 telling me I was selfish and I was ruining everything [that] he
 
15
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
wanted to do. And I was interfering with both of them.  LI also
 
noticed that [t]hey started kissing  and [Behrendt] started
 
holding her hand, putting his arms around her and, you know, just
 
like a boyfriend and girlfriend[.]   LI testified that when she
 
asked him about it,
 
He just told me that he  you know, it was his culture
and that I was ruining his culture because he s Native
American. And that in the mainland, they used to do
that all the time, that they used to hold hands and
nobody said anything. And now that we moved down here,
that everybody s saying something and, you know, it
was wrong for them to do it. . . .
 
When they moved to the Aloha Kona house, sometimes LI
 
would wake up early in the morning and Behrendt would be in SI s
 
curtained-off bedroom. Behrendt told her that SI was braiding
 
his hair. Also, Behrendt would get upset when she or others in
 her family would say something to him about how he was acting
 towards [SI]. 
 
When they moved to the Pumehana house, Behrendt and SI
 got closer  and [h]e was always around her all the
 
time. . . . you couldn t separate them.  They also started
 wearing rings together.  LI and Behrendt had a daughter in June
 2004, and Behrendt told LI that he wanted SI to be called mom
 also.  LI tried to get Behrendt to move to the mainland, but he
 
did not want to move unless SI moved with them.
 
In November 2004, LI moved to Washington and lived with 
her cousin for a few months. LI returned to Hawai» i on 
January 11, 2005, and moved back in with Behrendt on the 23rd. Behrendt told LI that he and SI had gotten in a fight about 
16
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
something when they were in the car and that he hit her with the
 
back of his hand. After LI moved in, she never saw SI with
 
Behrendt.
 
LI testified that SI told her about her sexual
 
relationship with Behrendt in March 2006, and LI called the
 
police.  Afterwards, LI and her daughter moved back to the
 
Pumehana house.
 
c. Testimony of Dr. Alexander Bivens
 
Dr. Alexander Bivens, Ph.D., testified for the State as
 
an expert in the area of child and adolescent psychology, with a
 
specialization in child sexual abuse.  He testified that it is
 
typical for a child who has been sexually abused to wait a very
 
long time to tell anyone about it,11 especially when they are
 
assaulted by a family member,12 and identified the methods
 
typically used by an abuser to gain the trust of the child. 
These methods include spending a lot of time with the child,
 giving them attention, touching them non-sexually, telling them
 
they are special, treating them like an adult, or tricking them
 into feeling safe with the abuser. Dr. Bivens also testified
 
11 Dr. Bivens indicated that the reasons a child may not disclose the
abuse include: fear for their own safety,  feeling ashamed  or blam[ing]
themselves,  trying not to think about the abuse,  feeling like reporting
would not help to end the abuse, or a fear of the impact on their family. 
 
12
 Dr. Bivens testified that a brother-in-law living in the same home
with, and abusing, the child victim would be considered an incest situation.
He further indicated that some abusers sexually assault the child with another
non-collaborating adult present in the same bed because [i]t help[s] the
molester feel like a big guy, to be able to get away with it  or because they
are so sexually compulsive that they couldn t keep themselves from doing it. 
 
17
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
about four primary processes  abusers utilize: (1) seduction and
 
testing, which involves taking normal adult-child touch, which
 
would be a hug, a kiss, that sort of affectionate touching,
 
. . . and slowly incorporating sexual touch ; (2) masking sex as
 
a game, such as wrestling or tickling; (3) emotional-verbal
 
coercion, in which the abuser talks about sex overtly or rewards
 
for having sex, or tells the child that he or she will avoid
 punishment for other acts if the child has sex with the abuser;
 and (4) taking advantage of the child in a vulnerable position,
 such as approaching a child who is sleeping or who has just taken
 
a bath.
 
d. State s Other Witnesses
 
The State s other witnesses included a nurse who
 
examined Behrendt in order to confirm testimony by SI that
 
Behrendt had a distinctive freckle and unusually thick
 
circumcision scar on his penis.
 
2. Defense Case 
a. Behrendt s testimony 
Behrendt denied having had any sexual interactions with 
SI. He loved [SI] like a daughter  and considered her [his] 
child.   He would kiss SI ( a peck ) like he used to do with his 
family. Behrendt testified that when SI lived with him and LI in 
South Dakota, he would take her to and from school each day and
 
help her with her homework when they got home. He and LI would
 
take SI to the pool and LI always took SI to the girls  showers.
 
18
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Behrendt never took SI to the pool by himself, and the only time 
he showered with SI was at the beach in Hawai» i with their 
swimsuits on. 
Behrendt testified that he and LI decided to move back 
to Hawai» i in the summer of 2002 to start a family.  At the going 
away party at Trista s house, SI got upset after a boy walked by 
and went upstairs to the bathroom. He and LI went upstairs together to talk to her, and then Behrendt went back downstairs 
and LI stayed with SI.  Trista later called them about a small 
hole in her bathroom wall, and even though Behrendt did not know 
how it got there, he fixed it for her. 
Behrendt testified that when they returned to Hawai» i, 
they moved in with SI and LI s family, who was like their own group  and did their own thing.  LI braided his hair until their daughter was born, and then SI took over. Behrendt would 
wake up at four in the morning for work, he would go into SI s room, open up the curtains, sit down on the bed  and SI would 
braid his hair for ten minutes and then he would leave for work. He denied ever having a romantic liaison  with SI or ever telling his daughter to call SI mom.  
Behrendt testified that in August or September 2004, he
 
and LI discussed moving to Washington, but he did not want to go
 
because he didn t have any money because [LI] cleaned out  his
 
bank account. Behrendt was stressing out  because their
 marriage [was] falling apart[,]  and was extremely upset when
 
19
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[LI] left.   After LI moved out, her parents told him to leave
 
their house.  Behrendt then lived in his car for about a month,
 
and moved into the Crazy Horse apartment on December 17, 2004.
 
Behrendt testified that SI never lived with him at the
 
Crazy Horse apartment, and that he had never given her a key to
 
the apartment.  SI was dating Brandon at the time, and Behrendt
 
was never jealous of Brandon. On January 15 or 16, 2005, LI and
 
their daughter moved in with Behrendt, along with Behrendt s
 sister. Behrendt testified that he received a phone call from SI
 
on January 17, 2005, they had a conversation, he talked to LI
 
about it, and then he went back to sleep.
 
After his rental agreement terminated in June 2005,
 
Behrendt moved to another place, and LI moved in with her
 
parents. He and LI agreed that their marriage was over, and in
 
November 2005, Behrendt started seeing another woman.
 
b. Other Defense Witnesses
 
The defense called several other witnesses, including 
Behrendt s mother and two sisters (one of whom lived with SI, LI,
 and Behrendt for eight months in South Dakota), who testified
 that they did not notice anything unusual about the way Behrendt
 
treated LI or SI. Rather, Behrendt treated SI like his little
 sister and hugged and kissed her like he did with all his
 
siblings.  One of his sisters also testified that she had found
 
portions of SI s journal which described some sexual incidents
 
between SI and Behrendt at the Aloha Kona house, and that SI
 
20
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
subsequently told her that she made it all up to hurt LI.
 
Additionally, a friend of Behrendt s testified that she became
 
friends with SI, and that in November 2006, SI told her that she
 
had lied in court about having sex with a guy named Running Bear.
 
C. Jury Instructions and Verdict
 
1. Jury Instructions
 
At the conclusion of trial, the circuit court
 
instructed the jury with regard to the prior bad act evidence as
 
follows:
 
You have heard evidence that the defendant at
 
another time, may have engaged in other wrongs or
acts. You must not use this evidence to determine
 that the defendant is a person of bad character and
therefore must have committed the offenses charged in
this case. Such evidence may be considered by you
only on the issue of the defendant s motive,
opportunity, or intent and for no other purpose.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
The circuit court also instructed the jury on the
 
offense of sexual assault in the first degree, HRS § 707­
730(1)(c), and the lesser included offense of sexual assault in
 
the third degree, HRS § 707-732(1)(c).  Defense counsel did not
 
object to giving the lesser included offense instruction, but did
 
object that the instruction did not correctly set forth the state
 of mind requirement.
 
After the jury began its deliberations, it sent the
 
circuit court the following question: What purpose do we put to
 
the evidence and testimony from S. Dakota[?]  The circuit court
 
responded by referring the jury to the instruction involving the
 
21
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prior bad act evidence referenced above.
 
2. Verdict and motion for judgment of acquittal
 
The jury returned a verdict finding Behrendt: (1)
 
guilty of the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the
 
third degree on Counts 1, 2, and 3; and (2) guilty of the lesser
 included offense of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree,
 
HRS § 707-721, on Count 4.
 
Behrendt filed a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal and a
 
Motion for New Trial, arguing that there was no evidence
 
presented of sexual contact  between Behrendt and SI with
 
respect to Counts 1-3, but rather only sexual penetration.   The
 
circuit court denied the motion.
 
On April 16, 2008, the circuit court filed its
 
Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence, sentencing Behrendt to
 
five years imprisonment.
 
D. ICA Appeal
 
On appeal to the ICA, Behrendt raised eight points of
 
error (only three of which are raised in his current
 
application): (1) that the circuit court erred in admitting
 character evidence in violation of HRE Rules 404(b) and 403; (2)
 
that the circuit court erroneously admitted Dr. Bivens  expert
 
testimony; (3) that the circuit court erred in permitting LI to
 
testify regarding entries in her diary and in admitting her diary
 
into evidence; (4) that the circuit court erred in refusing to
 stay the trial for one day due to the birth of Behrendt s child;
 
22
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(5) that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury on the
 
lesser included offense of sexual assault in the third degree for
 
Counts 1, 2, and 3 since there was no reasonable basis in the
 
evidence to justify giving the instruction; (6) that the circuit
 
court erred in providing the jury with an incorrect definition of
 sexual contact  as to Counts 1, 2 and 3; (7) that there was
 
insufficient evidence to support Behrendt s conviction for sexual
 assault in the third degree; and (8) that the circuit court s
 inclusion of the phrase exact date is not required  in the jury
 
instructions with regard to the incidents charged in Counts 1-4
 
amounted to plain error. 
In its November 4, 2009 SDO, the ICA rejected
 
Behrendt s argument with respect to prior bad act evidence, and
 concluded that:
 
[] The circuit court properly admitted evidence
of Behrendt s prior bad acts under HRE Rule 404(b) as
evidence of delayed reporting, preparation, planning,
and common scheme. Delayed reporting was an issue of
consequence in the trial because [SI s] silence over a
two-year period of sexual abuse raised a serious issue
as to her credibility. Additionally, Behrendt
insinuated that [SI] conveniently came forward to help
[SI s] sister [] win custody of [LI] and Behrendt s
child from Behrendt.[13] The prior-bad-act evidence
also explained a unique household dynamic that helped
the trier-of-fact understand allegations of abuse in
Hawai»i in general. The evidence was therefore 
relevant for a purpose other than mere propensity.
 
The circuit court s limiting instructions on the
admission of this prior-bad-act evidence ameliorated
any prejudice it may have created. We accordingly
find no abuse of discretion.
 
13
 This is an apparent reference to defense counsel s closing
argument, in which counsel suggested that SI and LI had lied about the
incidents of sexual contact between SI and Behrendt so LI could obtain custody
of her daughter.
 
23
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Citations omitted).
 
The ICA additionally rejected each of Behrendt s
 
remaining points of error, with the exception of his sixth point
 
regarding the definition of sexual contact.  Specifically, the
 
ICA recognized that the definitions of sexual contact  and
 sexual penetration  had been amended effective May 10, 2004, and
 
therefore, as to Count 3, the circuit court had provided the jury
 with the pre-amendment definitions. The ICA held that this error
 was not harmless, and therefore vacated Behrendt s conviction
 
with respect to Count 3. The ICA concluded that there was
 
sufficient evidence to prove that Behrendt engaged in sexual
 contact  as to Count 3, and therefore remanded for a new trial on
 
that count.
14
 
The ICA filed its judgment on November 24, 2009, and
 
Behrendt timely filed his application on February 22, 2010. 
E. Questions Presented
 
Behrendt s application presents the following
 
questions:
 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in affirming
Behrendt s convictions for Sexual Assault in the Third
 
Degree and Unlawful Imprisonment [15] because:
 
14
 The ICA also concluded that the circuit court had a rational basis
 
to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the
third degree, and that there was substantial evidence to support Behrendt's
convictions for Counts 1 and 2.
 
15
 Although Behrendt provides extensive argument as to why his
convictions for Counts 1, 2 and 3 cannot stand, he provides no furtherargument with respect to his conviction for Count 4. Therefore, Count 4 will
not be further discussed. See Hawai
»i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule
40.1(d)(1). 
24
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a. At trial, the court erroneously admitted
character evidence in violation of Hawaii Rule of
 
Evidence (HRE), rules 404(b) and 403;
 
b. The circuit court erroneously instructed the
jury on the included offense of Sexual Assault in the
Third Degree in Counts 1-3, where there was not
reasonable basis in the evidence for these count
 [sic];
 
c. There was insufficient evidence to sustain
 
Behrendt s conviction for three counts of Sexual
 
Assault in the Third Degree.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Admissibility of Evidence under HRE Rules 401, 403 & 404(b)
 Prior bad act  evidence under [HRE] Rule 404(b)
. . . is admissible when it is 1) relevant and 2) more
probative than prejudicial. A trial court's
determination that evidence is relevant  within the
 meaning of HRE Rule 401 . . . is reviewed under the
right/wrong standard of review. However, a trial
court s balancing of the probative value of prior bad
act evidence against the prejudicial effect of such
evidence under HRE Rule 403 . . . is reviewed for
 abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs
 when the court clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or
disregards rules or principles of law to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.
 
State v. Fetelee , 117 Hawai» i 53, 62-63, 175 P.3d 709, 718-19 
(2008) (citation omitted). 
B. Jury Instructions
 
The standard of review for a trial court s issuance or
 
refusal of a jury instruction is whether, when read
and considered as a whole, the instructions given are
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent,
or misleading. Erroneous instructions are
presumptively harmful and are a ground for reversal
unless it affirmatively appears from the record as a
whole that the error was not prejudicial. In other
 
words, error is not to be viewed in isolation and
considered purely in the abstract.
 
State v. Kassebeer , 118 Hawai» i 493, 504, 193 P.3d 409, 420 
(2008) (quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
25
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
C.	 Sufficiency of the Evidence
 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; . . . . The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.
 
State v. Richie , 88 Hawai» i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) 
(citation omitted).  Substantial evidence  as to every material
 
element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.  Id. (internal
 
quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. 	General Principles Applicable to Admission of Evidence Under
HRE Rule 404(b) and 403
 
HRE Rule 404(b) (Supp. 2007) provides:
 
(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes,
wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of
a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It
may, however, be admissible where such evidence is probative
of another fact that is of consequence to the determination
of the action, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,
preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, modus operandi, or
absence of mistake or accident. In criminal cases, the
proponent of evidence to be offered under this subsection
shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or
during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good
cause shown, of the date, location, and general nature of
any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.
 
The rule prohibits the admission of evidence introduced
 
for the sole purpose of establishing that a defendant possesses a
 
criminal character and acted in conformity with that character. 
Although such evidence may not be used solely for the purpose of
 
establishing criminal propensity, under certain circumstances it
 
26
  
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
may be offered to prove other facts of consequence. See State v. 
Kassebeer, 118 Hawai» i 493, 506, 193 P.3d 409, 422 (2008). Such 
facts include, but are not limited to, motive, opportunity, 
intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, modus operandi, 
or absence of mistake or accident.  HRE Rule 404(b). The list 
of permissible purposes in Rule 404(b) is not intended to be 
exhaustive for the range of relevancy outside the ban is almost indefinite.   State v. Clark , 83 Hawai» i 289, 300-01, 926 P.2d 
194, 205-06 (1996) (citation omitted); State v. Cordeiro , 99 
Hawai» i 390, 414, 56 P.3d 692, 716 (2002). Rule 404(b) was 
intended not to define the set of permissible purposes for which bad-acts evidence may be admitted but rather to define the one 
impermissible purpose for such evidence. . . . : a person who commits a crime probably has a defect of character; a person with a defect of character is more likely than people generally to 
have committed the act in question.  Clark , 83 Hawai» i at 301, 
926 P.2d at 206 (citation and brackets omitted; emphasis in 
original). 
When evidence is offered for substantive reasons rather 
than propensity, a trial court must additionally weigh the 
potential prejudicial effects of the evidence against its probative value under HRE Rule 403.
16 See Kassebeer, 118 Hawai» i 
HRE Rule 403 states: Although relevant, evidence may be excluded
if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence. 
 
27
 16 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 507, 193 P.3d at 423; Commentary to HRE Rule 404 (stating that
 
if offered for specified purposes other than mere character and
 
propensity . . . other crimes, wrongs, or acts  evidence may be
 
admissible provided the Rule 403 test is met ). 
In State v. Castro , 69 Haw. 633, 756 P.2d 1033 (1988),
 
this court discussed the dangers of admitting propensity
 
evidence, and stressed the need for courts to apply this
 balancing test even when evidence is substantively relevant:
 
The framers of the rule recognized that [c]haracter
evidence is of slight probative value and may be very
prejudicial.  For [i]t tends to distract the trier of fact
from the main question of what actually happened on the
particular occasion.  And  [i]t . . . permits the trier
. . . to reward the good man and to punish the bad man
because of their respective characters despite what the
evidence in the case shows actually happened.  
. . . .
 
Yet even when the evidence of other crimes, wrongs or
acts tends to establish a fact of consequence to the
determination of the case, the trial court is still obliged
to exclude the evidence if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,
confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
presentation of cumulative evidence.  [HRE Rule] 403. For
the use of the word may  in [HRE Rule] 404(b) was not
intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on the trial
judge but was rather designed to trigger the Rule 403
balance.
 
Id. at 643, 756 P.2d at 1041 (some brackets in the original; some
 
internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
Therefore, we must determine (1) if the South Dakota
 
evidence was probative of any fact of consequence other than
 
character and propensity; and, if so, (2) whether the circuit
 
court abused its discretion in determining that the probative
 
value of the evidence substantially outweighed the danger of
 
28
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
unfair prejudice to Behrendt.17 See Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii
 
Rules of Evidence Manual § 404-3[1] (2008-2009 ed.) [hereinafter 
Bowman]; State v. Fetelee, 117 Hawai» i 53, 62-63, 175 P.3d 709, 
718-19 (2008) (  Prior bad act  evidence under HRE Rule 404(b) is admissible when it is 1) relevant and 2) more probative than 
prejudicial. ) (citation, brackets and ellipses omitted); State 
v. Renon, 73 Haw. 23, 32, 828 P.2d 1266, 1270 (1992).
 
B.	 Evidence of Sexual Contacts in South Dakota Was Probative of
 
Opportunity
 
The State s evidence
18 established that the first 
charged incidents of sexual assault in Hawai» i occurred while SI, 
LI and Behrendt were living at the Kamani Trees house with SI s 
family. By that time, Behrendt and SI had been engaging in sexual intercourse for at least two years. The first sexual contact in Hawai» i occurred one night while SI was sleeping in 
the same bed with LI and Behrendt, and Behrendt turned SI on her 
side and had vaginal intercourse with her from behind. They continued to have sexual intercourse about three to five times a 
17 In conducting this analysis, we note that there is some variation
between the purposes identified by the circuit court in its written order
(motive, opportunity and plan) and in its instructions to the jury (motive,
opportunity and intent). However, since we conclude that the evidence was
probative of opportunity, which was identified by the circuit court both in
its order and its instruction, that variation is not material in the
circumstances of this case.
 
18
 This court may use evidence adduced at trial in order to determine
whether the circuit court abused its discretion in granting, in part, the
State s motion to reconsider the circuit court s grant of Behrendt s earliermotion in limine. See, e.g. , Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai
»i 1, 7, 84 P.3d 509,
515 (2004) ( The denial of a motion in limine, in itself, is not reversibleerror. . . . the real test is not in the disposition of the motion but in the
admission of evidence at trial. ) (internal quotation marks and citationomitted). 
29
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
month while living at that house. 
The prior sexual contacts between SI and Behrendt in
 
South Dakota were relevant to establish Behrendt s opportunity to
 
engage in the sexual contacts in Hawaii without being detected. 
The evidence established how the relationship between Behrendt
 
and SI had developed so that the sexual contacts in Kona could
 
take place without SI reporting them. Absent that evidence, it
 would be implausible that Behrendt could suddenly engage in
 sexual intercourse with SI in a house they shared with her family
 while SI s sister slept in the same bed, without SI reporting it. 
Specifically, the evidence from South Dakota
 
established that Behrendt had initially explored SI s willingness
 to engage in sexual conduct by first suggesting that they take
 showers together, then having her touch his penis in the shower,
 followed by him touching her genitalia, and then progressing to
 
sexual intercourse.
 
The State s expert witness on child sexual abuse, Dr.
 
Bivens, testified about a study involving interviews of
 approximately thirty child sexual offenders, who identified
 seduction and testing  as a method they used to accomplish the
 abuse:
 
. . . Seduction and testing involves taking
normal adult-child touch, which would be a hug, a
kiss, that sort of affectionate touching, which I hope
is happening between adults and children, and slowly
incorporating sexual touch into.
The classic example that s in the book is
watching television, snuggling on the couch. And what
 the abuser will do is touch more frequently in more
sexual ways. Now that s the seduction part. The
 
30
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
testing part is that all the molesters reported that
they were waiting and monitoring the reaction of the
child. And what they reported was that they said that
if the child was going to startle or somehow react in
a way that let them know that they were going to get
into trouble for it that they would have backed off
completely.
 
The evidence also established that Behrendt developed a
 
relationship of trust and control with SI in South Dakota. 
Behrendt was SI s primary caretaker when SI s sister was working,
 
bought her things, and took her side when she had disagreements
 
with her sister.19 He assured her that their sexual touching was
 okay  and that her sister said it was okay  for them to shower
 
together.  Also, he showed her a pornographic videotape when they
 
were alone together.20
 
After their relationship became sexual, SI testified
 
that at first she was confused  and occasionally acted rude to
 
Behrendt to push[] him off.   On those occasions, he would
 
discipline her by putting her nose on the wall for a few minutes,
 
19 Dr. Bivens testified that abusers typically use various strategies
to gain the trust of the child, such as spending a lot of time with the child,
giving them attention, touching them non-sexually, telling them they are
special, treating them like an adult, or tricking them into feeling safe with
the abuser.
 
20 Dr. Bivens also testified about the significance of the display of
pornography to a child:
 
Introduction to pornography usually is put under the
category of emotional and verbal coercion. It is
 usually regarded as a form of sexual abuse in and of
itself. It clearly raises the topic of sexuality with
the child. It will very likely lead to more
sexualized behavior by the child, perhaps get the
child to become interested in sexuality and things
like that. It would certainly be lots of negative
effects. . . .
 
31
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
or he and LI would threaten to send her back to Hawai» i.21 
Behrendt also repeatedly told SI that she could not tell about 
what was happening or he would be separated from her and would go 
to jail. 
SI testified that by the time that SI, her sister and
 
Behrendt returned to Kona, she had grown close to Behrendt and
 started liking him  because he was there for her as a friend:
 
. . . I told him everything. [He] [b]ought me stuff.
If anytime there was an argument, like an argument
between me and my sister or something, it seems like
he stuck up for me. Or even when we got back to my
parents, my parents - all of us, we would argue about
something or just have a disagreement, and he was
always sticking up for me, like he was there for me.
 
In sum, by the time that SI returned to Hawai» i, SI had 
become acclimated to the sexual contact. Her relationship with 
Behrendt had developed from the early stages when she would 
occasionally act rudely and push him off,  to the point where she had grown close to him and started liking him, because he 
was there for me.  Thus, when Behrendt had sex with SI at Kamani Trees while her sister slept in the same bed, it was another contact in an established sexual relationship. SI s failure to cry out or tell anyone what had occurred that night and on the subsequent occasions of sexual contact in Hawai» i was consistent 
with the relationship that had been established in South Dakota. 
Thus, the evidence of the sexual contacts in South Dakota was 
21
 Dr. Bivens testified that emotional and verbal coercion  is
 
another common strategy used by child sexual abusers, in which the abuser will
talk about rewards for having sex or withdrawal with punishment. I won t
 
punish you for being late if you give me some sex, that type of thing. 
 
32
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
relevant to show Behrendt s opportunity to commit the charged 
sexual assaults in Hawai» i without being detected. 
There are no Hawai» i cases involving child sexual abuse 
that address the admissibility of the defendant s prior sexual 
interaction with the complaining witness. However, cases from 
other jurisdictions have held that such evidence is admissible 
under rules comparable to HRE Rule 404(b). See, e.g. , State v. 
Cox, 169 P.3d 806, 813-14 (Utah Ct. App. 2007) (holding that 
evidence of an uncharged incident of sexual conduct was admissible to demonstrate an ongoing pattern of behavior by the 
defendant toward one particular victim) (citing State v. Reed , 8 
P.3d 1025, 1030-32 (Utah 2000) (concluding that evidence of 
specific uncharged instances of the defendant s treatment of the child demonstrated the manner in which [the defendant] intensely pursued the victim over a three-and-a-half year period in order 
to gain opportunity to commit the unlawful sexual acts )); State 
v. Baptista, 894 A.2d 911, 915-16 (R.I. 2006) (holding that
 
evidence of uncharged sexual assaults against defendant s step­
daughter over a period of two and a half years was admissible to
 show the defendant s intent and lewd disposition toward the
 particular child victim); State v. Paul , 769 N.W.2d 416, 425-26
 
(N.D. 2009) (approving trial court s admission of evidence that
 
defendant made complaining witness watch nasty movies  and
 engaged in sexual conduct with her in another state prior to the
 
33
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
charged conduct as probative of plan and preparation).22
 
In sum, the State clearly articulated a legitimate 
purpose for the evidence, i.e., establishing Behrendt s 
opportunity to commit the offenses in Hawai» i without being 
detected. Both the testimony of SI and the testimony of Dr. Bivens provided the evidentiary foundation for that non-character 
use of the evidence. Thus, this is not a situation where the state offered a pretextual reason for the admission of the evidence, but in fact appeared to be using it to establish the bad character of the defendant. Cf. Fetelee, 117 Hawai» i at 82­
85, 175 P.3d at 738-741 (in case of attempted murder, attempted assault and theft, concluding that evidence of an unrelated prior incident where the defendant entered his neighbor s apartment and punched a visitor would likely cause the jury to infer[] that [the defendant] was a violent person of bad character  and was 
therefore not admissible under HRE 404(b)). 
Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence of sexual
 
contacts in South Dakota was relevant to establish opportunity.
23
 
22 We note that some of the purposes identified by these courts are
overlapping. Thus, when a defendant engages in behavior that culminates in a
sexual relationship with a child, the evidence of that behavior could be
admissible to show that defendant had a plan (to gain the child s trust and
acquiescence), engaged in preparation (by seducing and testing the child) and
did so in order to have the opportunity to engage in sexual conduct with the
child without being detected.
 
23
 Since we conclude that the evidence was relevant to establish
 
opportunity, we need not determine whether the other purposes identified by
the circuit court were relevant in these circumstances. Cf. State v. Austin,
70 Haw. 300, 305-08, 769 P.2d 1098, 1101-02 (1989) (trial court instructed the
jury that it could consider evidence of the defendant s prior uncharged acts
for seven purposes delineated in HRE 404(b); this court concluded that the

C.	 The Probative Value of the Evidence of Sexual Contacts in
 
South Dakota Was Not Outweighed by Any Prejudicial Effect
 
We next consider whether the probative value of the
 
evidence was substantially outweighed  by the danger of unfair
 
prejudice to Behrendt. HRE Rule 403. When weighing probative
 value versus prejudicial effect in this context, a court must
 consider a variety of factors, including:
 
. . . the strength of the evidence as to the commission of
the other crime, the similarities between the crimes, the
interval of time that has elapsed between the crimes, the
need for the evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof,
and the degree to which the evidence probably will rouse the
jury to overmastering hostility.
 
State v. Renon , 73 Haw. 23, 38, 828 P.2d 1266, 1273 (1992)
 
(citation omitted).
 
In the instant case, these factors weigh in favor of 
admission of the evidence. The strength of the evidence of the 
uncharged conduct is essentially the same as for the charged 
offenses, since the State relied primarily on the testimony of 
SI, together with the testimony of her sister and the observations of some other witnesses, to establish both the 
conduct in South Dakota and the conduct in Hawai» i. Cf. Reed, 8 
P.3d at 1030-32 (concluding that evidence of both charged and uncharged instances of the defendant s sexual contact with the child victim were essentially interchangeable, were of the same nature and character as the primary offense, and were carried out 
(...continued)
trial court properly admitted the evidence of prior uncharged offenses under
HRE 404(b), analyzing two of the seven purposes). 
35
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
on the same victim during the same uninterrupted course of
 
conduct[,]  and therefore the probative value of the evidence of
 
the uncharged instances outweighed the prejudicial effect).
 
The similarities between the crimes were strong, since 
the conduct in South Dakota was in substance the same as that in 
Hawai» i, i.e., alleged sexual contact between SI and Behrendt. 
And although the South Dakota conduct took place over a several-
year period, it immediately preceded the conduct in Hawai» i and 
thus was not remote in time. Cf. State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai» i 
172, 183, 907 P.2d 758, 769 (1995) (holding that the trial court 
did not abuse its discretion in concluding that prior bad act 
evidence was more probative than prejudicial; the trial court noted, inter alia, that very little time [] elapsed between the
 
prior act evidence and the instant offense charged ) (emphasis
 added).
 
There was also a substantial need for the evidence. We 
have previously emphasized the importance of the need factor,  Clark, 83 Hawai» i at 303, 926 P.2d at 208 (citations omitted), 
and one commentator has observed that in a case involving high 
relevance and strong need, the rule 403 balance will always favor admissibility.  Bowman § 404-3[2][B]. Absent the evidence of sexual contacts between SI and Behrendt in South Dakota, the jury 
would have been left with the false impression that the sexual contact started at Kamani Trees. SI s failure to cry out when Behrendt had sexual intercourse with her the first time at Kamani 
36
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Trees, as her sister slept nearby, and her failure to report that
 
incident as well as the subsequent incidents, would have been
 
inexplicable, as would the fact that Behrendt would suddenly
 
engage in such conduct after having lived in close proximity to
 
SI for three years. 
This court has previously recognized that testimony
 
regarding a defendant s prior bad acts can be highly probative in
 understanding the conduct of a complaining witness in a sexual
 assault case. In State v. Iaukea , 56 Haw. 343, 537 P.2d 724
 
(1975), the complaining witness was a psychiatric social worker
 
who was abducted and raped by the defendant. The complaining
 
witness knew of the defendant s prior acts of violence and rape
 while treating him as part of her duties. Id.  at 352, 537 P.2d
 
at 731. She testified that she remained calm during the assault,
 both because of her training in how to deal with crisis
 
situations, and because she was afraid of provoking the defendant
 to violence given what she knew about his past. Id.  at 347, 537
 
P.2d at 728. This court held that her testimony about her
 knowledge of defendant s prior bad acts was relevant to show lack
 of consent, and noted that:
 
The testimony of the complaining witness
concerning the prior crimes which, to her knowledge,
appellant had committed, credibly explained and placed
in context many of her statements to and actions
toward him. Her fear of the appellant was in part due
to his past history of attacks on women. The
complaining witness made every effort to remain calm
and to refrain from screaming because of her training
as a psychiatric social worker. In her judgment she
had a better chance of avoiding serious bodily injury
if she remained calm. She feared that he would cut
 her up  if she tried to fight him. 
 
37
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
It was important that the jury know all of the
facts involved so that they would not mistakenly
construe the complaining witness s calm manner and
lack of screaming as indicative of consent or lack of
forcible compulsion. 
Id. at 352, 537 P.2d at 731.
 
While the issue in Iaukea was lack of consent, and the 
issue here concerns SI s failure to promptly report the sexual 
contacts in Hawai» i, nevertheless the underlying principle is the 
same: there is a substantial need for prior bad acts evidence 
when the exclusion of that evidence will create a false 
impression by the jury regarding the actions of the complaining witness. 
The next Rule 403 factor, the efficacy of alternative 
proof, also weighs in favor of admitting the South Dakota evidence. There was no alternative way to establish the 
progression of Behrendt s behaviors, including his seduction and testing of SI and his development of a relationship of trust and 
control over her as their sexual relationship evolved. Although there was evidence that showed Behrendt s continued, and indeed, intensified efforts to maintain his relationship of trust and control with SI after they returned to Hawai» i, that evidence 
would be likely to confuse rather than enlighten the jury absent 
the context provided by the prior conduct in South Dakota. 
Finally, the evidence of the conduct in South Dakota
 
was not likely to rouse the jury to an overmastering sense of
 
hostility against Behrendt. The conduct in South Dakota was of
 
the same general type and involved the same complaining witness
 
38
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as the conduct in Hawai» i. The jury heard testimony from SI 
about numerous sexual encounters between SI and Behrendt in 
Hawai» i, including acts of sexual intercourse preceded on most 
occasions by SI licking Behrendt s penis to get it wet,  and an occasion when Behrendt attempted to or did insert his penis in 
her anus. As the Court of Appeals of Utah noted: 
[T]he evidence was not unfairly prejudicial because
[the complaining witness s] testimony regarding the
[uncharged] sexual abuse that occurred in Wasatch
County was essentially interchangeable with and of the
same nature and character as her testimony regarding
Defendant s [charged] conduct in Salt Lake County.
Such evidence of multiple acts of similar or identical
abuse is unlikely to prejudice a jury; jurors will
either believe or disbelieve the testimony based on
the witness s credibility, not whether the witness
asserts an act occurred [an additional time].
 
Cox, 169 P.3d at 814 (quotations and citations omitted, some
 
brackets in original and some added).
 
The primary difference between the sexual conduct in 
Hawai» i and that in South Dakota was that the South Dakota 
conduct occurred while SI was several years younger, and, 
according to SI, occurred more frequently than in Hawai» i. Those 
are relevant considerations which could, depending on the circumstances, provide a basis for limiting such evidence or excluding it altogether. However, we do not believe that they caused overmastering hostility  in the circumstances of this 
case, particularly since the State did not argue in closing that SI s age at the time of the South Dakota contacts made Behrendt s 
conduct more culpable or reprehensible, and since there was evidence of a substantial number of contacts in Hawai» i over a 
39
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
period of about two years.
 
We further note that the potential for juror confusion
 
here did not tip the balance against admission of the evidence. 
See HRE Rule 403. As noted above, the jury did send a question
 
to the court regarding how to use the testimony and evidence from
 South Dakota. However, the court responded appropriately by
 
referring the jury back to the court s limiting instruction
 regarding the permissible purposes for that evidence, and there
 were no further questions from the jury on that subject. The
 fact that the jury had a question, without more, does not
 
establish that the jury was confused. To the contrary, it is not
 
surprising that the jury asked for clarification, since the
 court s instruction did not specifically state that it was
 referring to the evidence from South Dakota. By referring the
 jury back to that instruction in response to its question, the
 
court clarified that the instruction covered the South Dakota
 evidence, and there is no basis for concluding that the admission
 
of the South Dakota evidence resulted in any prejudicial jury
 
confusion.
 
In sum, this court has stated that the determination 
of the admissibility of relevant evidence under HRE 403 is eminently suited to the trial court s exercise of its discretion 
because it requires a cost-benefit calculus and a delicate balance between probative value and prejudicial effect.  Clark, 
83 Hawai» i at 302, 926 P.2d at 207 (citations omitted). The 
40
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circuit court here carefully considered that balance. It required
 
the State to give a detailed description of the evidence prior to
 
trial, and refused to admit some of the proposed testimony.24 We
 
cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in
 concluding that the probative value of the evidence it admitted
 
was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
 
D.	 There Was Sufficient Evidence to Instruct the Jury on the
Lesser Included Offense of Sexual Assault in the Third
 
Degree for Counts 1-3, and to Sustain Behrendt s Convictions
 
Behrendt argues that the circuit court erred in
 
instructing the jury on the offense of sexual assault in the
 
third degree because [t]he only evidence that was presented by
 the State in regard to sexual assault was evidence of repeated
 sexual penetrations ,  which would constitute first degree sexual
 
assault. Behrendt similarly argues that there was insufficient
 
evidence to support his convictions for Counts 1-3 and therefore
 the circuit court erred in denying his motion for judgment of
 
acquittal.
 
HRS § 707-730(1)(c) provides that a person commits the
 
offense of first degree sexual assault when [t]he person
 
knowingly engages in sexual penetration with a person who is at
 least fourteen years old but less than sixteen years old;
 provided that: (i) The person is not less than five years older
 
24
 As noted above, the circuit court concluded that the testimony of
two of the State s proposed witnesses was inadmissible because it would be
cumulative and the prejudicial value would outweigh the probative value. See
 
supra, part I.A. & note 7.
 
41
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
than the minor; and (ii) The person is not legally married to the
 
minor; . . . .  HRS § 707-732(1)(c) defines the offense of third
 
degree sexual assault the same way as HRS § 707-730(1), except
 
that a person commits the offense of third degree sexual assault
 
by engaging in sexual contact  rather than sexual penetration. 
 
As noted above, part I.D, the ICA concluded that there
 
was sufficient evidence to support Behrendt s convictions on all
 counts, but remanded for a new trial on Count 3 because of the
 circuit court s failure to properly instruct the jury on the
 amended definition of sexual contact. 
25 The State 
25 As explained by the ICA, the definitions of both sexual contact  
and sexual penetration  were amended in 2004, in response to this court s
holding in State v. Mueller , 102 Hawai »i 391, 76 P.3d 943 (2003), which
overruled this court s previous holding in State v. Rulona , 71 Haw. 127, 785
P.2d 615 (1990). 
Prior to 2004, sexual penetration  was defined as:
 
vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio,
cunnilingus, anilingus, deviate sexual intercourse, or
any intrusion of any part of a person's body or of any
object into the genital or anal opening of another
person s body; it occurs upon any penetration, however
slight, but emission is not required.
 
HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 1986 & 1993).
 Sexual contact  was defined as:
 
any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of
a person not married to the actor, or of the sexual or
other intimate parts of the actor by the person,
whether directly or through the clothing or other
material intended to cover the sexual or other
 
intimate parts.
 
HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 1987 & 1993).
 
In Mueller , involving alleged acts of cunnilingus, this court held
that the plain language of HRS § 707-700, specifically the phrase it occurs 
upon any penetration, however slight,  mandates proof of penetration[,]   inorder to convict for sexual assault in the first degree for acts ofcunnilingus. 102 Hawai
»i at 393, 76 P.3d at 945. Thereafter the legislature
amended the definitions of sexual penetration  and sexual contact  in HRS §
(continued...)
 
42
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
did not appeal the ICA s conclusion with respect to Count 3, nor
 
does Behrendt address it in his application.  Therefore, we must
 
determine whether there was a rational basis for the circuit
 
court to instruct the jury on sexual assault in the third degree
 
for Counts 1 and 2, see State v. Kinnane, 79 Hawai» i 46, 49, 987 
P.2d 973, 976 (1995) ( in the absence of [] a rational basis in
 
the evidence, the trial court should not instruct the jury as to
 included offenses ) (emphasis omitted), and whether there was
 sufficient evidence to support Behrendt s convictions on all
 
three counts. We conclude that there was, and therefore affirm
 
the ICA.
 
The definition of sexual contact  in HRS § 707-700
 
(...continued)
707-700, effective May 10, 2004, for the purpose of clarifying that the
definition of sexual penetration  would include cunnilingus and anilingus
whether or not actual penetration occurred. 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 61, § 2
at 302-03.
 
The definition of sexual penetration  was therefore amended to
read as follows:
 
(1) Vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio,
deviate sexual intercourse, or any intrusion of any
part of a person's body or of any object into the
genital or anal opening of another person's body; it
occurs upon any penetration, however slight, but
emission is not required; or
(2) Cunnilingus or anilingus, whether or not actual
penetration has occurred. 
HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added). 
The definition of sexual contact  was amended to read as follows:
 
any touching, other than acts of sexual penetration  ,
of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not
married to the actor, or of the sexual or other
intimate parts of the actor by the person, whether
directly or through the clothing or other material
intended to cover the sexual or other intimate parts.
 
HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).
 
43
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(both the current definition, effective during the time period
 
covering Count 3, and the definition prior to the 2004
 
amendments, effective during the time period covering Counts 1
 
and 2), states that sexual contact  includes any touching   of
 
the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the
 
actor, or of the sexual or other intimate parts of the actor by
 the person, whether directly or through the clothing or other
 material intended to cover the sexual or other intimate parts.  
HRS § 707-700 (1993 & Supp. 2004) (emphasis added). 
SI testified that she and Behrendt repeatedly engaged
 
in sexual intercourse over the time periods covered by Counts 1­3. SI also recounted some of the specific instances in which
 
they had intercourse. For example, at a time when living at the
 Kamani Trees house (Count 1), SI testified that she was sleeping
 one night and Behrendt turned me around and he had sexual
 
intercourse with me in the back.  When living at the Aloha Kona
 house (Count 2), SI recounted a time when Behrendt asked her if
 
she wanna do it  and [Behrendt] just did sexual intercourse
 
from behind  where SI was over the bed, standing up, leaning
 over.  Also while living at the Aloha Kona house, SI testified
 that Behrendt would take her to a construction site nearby and
 they would have sexual intercourse in the car, where he would
 
have me sit on top of him, where he s behind me, or he would have
 me straddle him.  SI also recounted a time when Behrendt took
 her to a nearby construction and had me in the car, in the back
 
44
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
seat, and I just . . . was . . . like bent over the back seat,
 
and he was behind me[,]  and then Behrendt inserted his penis
 
into SI s vagina. SI also testified that Behrendt also took her
 
in a rental car to a different construction site in Kaloko where
 
they had sexual intercourse, and then Behrendt asked SI if she
 
wanted to do anal  and told her that it wouldn t hurt and other
 
girls do it. The DPA asked SI if Behrendt attempt[ed] it  and
 SI replied [y]es  and that he put his penis in my anal, my
 butt.  
Although this testimony indicates that there were
 
incidents of sexual penetration between SI and Behrendt, which
 would support a conviction for sexual assault in the first
 degree, a rational juror could have inferred that there was
 sexual contact  prior to the penetration, i.e., that there was
 touching  of the sexual or other intimate parts  of SI, such as
 
SI s genitalia, buttocks, or other intimate parts, either
 directly or through clothing, or that SI touched Behrendt s
 sexual or other intimate parts.  HRS § 707-700. This testimony, 
therefore, provided a rational basis to instruct the jury on sexual assault in the third degree, Kinnane , 79 Hawai» i at 49, 
987 P.2d at 976, and, when considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, was also sufficient to sustain Behrendt s 
convictions. Richie , 88 Hawai» i at 33, 960 P.2d at 1241. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The circuit court properly admitted the South Dakota
 
45
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
evidence because the evidence was probative of Behrendt s 
opportunity to commit the offenses in Hawai» i without being 
detected, and its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. 
We further hold that the circuit court did not err by
 
instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of sexual
 
assault in the third degree, and that there was sufficient
 evidence to support the convictions on Counts 1-3.
