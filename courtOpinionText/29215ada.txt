OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, J.
 
In the early morning of September 19, 2006,

 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee Tanya Rapozo, a.k.a. Tanya Rapoza
 
was stopped by police for driving erratically on Ala Wai
 Boulevard in Waikiki. She was subsequently placed under arrest
 and transported to the Honolulu Police Department’s main station,
 where she was searched. During that search, a police matron
 discovered a .38 caliber bullet inside Rapozo’s brassiere. The
 bullet was later tested and determined to be operable. 
Rapozo, who was a convicted felon, was charged with 
Ownership or Possession Prohibited of Any Firearm or Ammunition By a Person Convicted of Certain Crimes in violation of Hawai
'i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 134-7(b) and (h) (Supp. 2007), cited  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
infra. Rapozo filed a motion to dismiss that charge as a de
 
minimis infraction within the meaning of HRS § 702-236 (1993).1
 
In support of her motion, Rapozo submitted a declaration of
 counsel which asserted that her explanation for possessing the
 bullet was that “she was going to have it made into a charm for a
 bracelet.” The Circuit Court of the First Circuit granted the
 motion.
2 However, the Intermediate Court of Appeals vacated the
 
dismissal, and Rapozo timely filed an application for a writ of
 certiorari with this court. 
In her application, Rapozo raises the following
 
question:
 
Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that the
trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the
case under H.R.S. 702-236 the de minimus statute.
 
1	 HRS § 702-236 (1993) provides:
 
De minimis infractions. (1) The court may dismiss a
prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the
conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant
circumstances, it finds that the defendant’s conduct:
(a)	 Was within a customary license or
tolerance, which was not expressly refused
by the person whose interest was infringed
and which is not inconsistent with the
 purpose of the law defining the offense;
 or
 
(b) 	Did not actually cause or threaten the
harm or evil sought to be prevented by the
law defining the offense or did so only to
an extent too trivial to warrant the
 condemnation of conviction; or
(c)	 Presents such other extenuations that it
 cannot reasonably be regarded as envisaged
by the legislature in forbidding the
offense.
 
(2) The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under
subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a
written statement of its reasons.

 The Honorable Michael A. Town presided. 
-2­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
We have recognized previously that it is the 
defendant’s burden to place “all” of the relevant attendant 
circumstances before the trial court, and to establish why dismissal is warranted in light of those circumstances. See, 
e.g., State v. Park, 55 Haw. 610, 616, 525 P.2d 586, 591 (1974); State v. Viernes, 92 Hawai
'i 130, 134, 988 P.2d 195, 199 (1999) 
(quoting State v. Vance, 61 Haw. 291, 307, 602 P.2d 933, 944 (1979)). The only evidence offered by Rapozo in support of her motion was the declaration of her counsel, which omitted many of the relevant attendant circumstances. We therefore conclude that Rapozo failed to carry her burden of establishing that her conduct was de minimis within the meaning of HRS § 702-236. However, as we set forth below, we do not preclude the possibility that Rapozo could carry that burden at a later stage of the proceedings in the event a more fully developed record supports dismissal. See infra note 16. 
Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the ICA. 
I. Background
 
A. Factual and Procedural Background
 
On April 24, 2007, Rapozo was charged in an indictment
 
with Ownership or Possession Prohibited of Any Firearm or
 Ammunition By a Person Convicted of Certain Crimes in violation
 
3
of HRS § 134-7(b) and (h)  (Count I), and driving without a

-3­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
license in violation of HRS § 286-102 (Count II). 
On February 26, 2008, Rapozo filed a motion to dismiss
 
Count I of the indictment as de minimis within the meaning of HRS
 
§ 702-236. Rapozo also submitted a Declaration of Counsel
 (declaration) and a memorandum in support of the motion. 
Rapozo’s counsel declared, in relevant part, as follows:
 
. . .
 
2.	 The allegations in this matter are as follows:
a)	 At approximately 1:14 a.m. on September
19, 2006, Ms. Rapozo was driving a white
pickup truck on Ala Wai Boulevard in the
City and County of Honolulu, State of
Hawaii, when she was pulled over by
Honolulu police officer Jason Pistor for
driving erratically.
b)	 After making the stop, Officer Pistor
examined the VIN number on the pickup
truck and radioed that number to HPD
 dispatcher.
c)	 Dispatch found that the VIN number belong
[sic] to another vehicle and notified
Officer Pistor of that fact.
 
d)	 Officer Pistor then placed the defendant
under arrest for driving under the
influence and without a valid driver’s
 license and took her to the Central
 Processing Division at the main station.
3.	 At approximately 2:30 a.m. Ms. Rapozo was given
a pat down search by Police Matron Laura Chin
[sic] who felt something hard in defendant’s
brassrere [sic].
 
3(...continued)
Ownership or possession prohibited, when; penalty.
 
. . .
 
(b) 	No person who is under indictment for, or has
waived indictment for, or has been bound over to
the circuit court for, or has been convicted in
this State or elsewhere of having committed a
felony, or any crime of violence, or an illegal
sale of any drug shall own, possess, or control
any firearm or ammunition therefor.
 
. . .
 (h)	 Any person violating subsection (a) or (b) shall
be guilty of a class C felony; provided that any
felon violating subsection (b) shall be guilty
of a class B felony. Any person violating
subsection (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.
 
-4­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
4.	 Matron Chun escorted Ms. Rapozo into the holding
cell to conduct a more extensive search and
 found a single .38 caliber bullet in the left
cup of defendant’s bra.
5.	 Ms. Rapozo’s explanation for having the bullet
in her possession was that she was going to have
it made into a charm for a bracelet.
 
6.	 No gun was found by either Matron Chun or police
officer Pistor, nor was any other ammunition,
drugs or other contraband found in defendant’s
possession or control.
. . .
 
Rapozo argued that “under the relevant circumstances,
 
the finding of a single 38 caliber bullet in her bra did not
 
actually cause or threaten the harm sought to be prevented or did
 so only to the extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of
 conviction.” 
On March 3, 2008, the State filed a memorandum in
 
opposition to Rapozo’s motion to dismiss. In its memorandum, the
 State recited facts which were similar to those recited by
 Rapozo’s counsel, but with some additional detail. The State’s
 memorandum asserted that, at the time of the traffic stop,
 Rapozo’s “eyes were red and bloodshot,” she “made statements and
 questions that did not make any sense,” and “her behavior was
 bizarre to police officers.” The State’s memorandum also stated
 that “[Rapozo] had previously been convicted of Unauthorized
 Control of Propelled Vehicle, Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
 Third Degree and Theft in the Second Degree.” 
The State argued that the “direct and unambiguous
 
language” of HRS § 134-7(b) clearly prohibits a felon from
 owning, possessing or controlling any firearm or ammunition. The
 
-5­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
State further argued that applying the de minimis provision to a
 
single bullet, as Rapozo advocated, would render the statute’s
 prohibition against the possession of “any” ammunition
 superfluous. Moreover, the State noted that, at the time the
 bullet was recovered, Rapozo was in custody in the main police
 station holding facility, and Rapozo made no effort to turn the
 bullet over to police officers. The State argued that, although
 Rapozo was not found in possession of a gun or other firing
 device, the possession of a single bullet was not de minimis
 because “[a] bullet can be fired from a simple device that can be
 obtained/made by any one. For example, any home made gun such as
 a ‘zip gun,’ typically made by prisoners can fire a ‘bullet’ and
 cause the same harm.” 
The circuit court held a hearing on May 7, 2008. At
 
the start of the hearing, the circuit court asked Rapozo’s
 counsel whether he wished to argue the motion, and stated, “I’ve
 read over the motions. I’ll take judicial notice.” Neither the
 State nor Rapozo’s counsel voiced any objection. 
Rapozo’s counsel argued the motion, but Rapozo did not
 
testify at the hearing, nor did she present any other evidence. 
Rapozo’s counsel argued that “the question raised by this motion
 [is] . . . whether or not a possession of a single bullet in her
 bra, without the ability to fire it, violates the purpose of HRS
 [§] 134-7(b).” Rapozo’s counsel further argued that:
 
Under the facts of this case, a single bullet
hidden in the Defendant’s bra that could not be used
 
-6­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to harm anyone doesn’t really violate the purpose of
the statute; nor does it create the danger that the
statute was designed to prevent.
I think the Court should look at the attendant
 
circumstances of this case and not fantasize about the
 presence of a gun, if the State intends to muddy the
water by raising this specter of an imaginary Zip gun.
There was no .38 caliber pistol, no Zip gun, or any
other mechanism present at the time capable of firing
that bullet. 
After Rapozo’s counsel concluded his argument, the
 
circuit court addressed the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA) and
 
stated: 
Miss Ikeda, I also thoroughly understand what
you said [in the State’s memorandum in opposition to
Rapozo’s motion]. A bullet is a bullet. She’s a
 felon, and that a felon should not get anywhere near a
bullet or a piece of ammunition. It could have been
 smuggled into the facility and then you put a picture
of a so-called Zip gun or whatever.
 
The circuit court then questioned the DPA concerning
 
two photographs of homemade zip guns that were attached to the
 
State’s memorandum. The circuit court then asked the DPA whether
 she wished to add or emphasize anything for the record. The DPA
 declined, stating “[n]o, Your Honor. I believe it’s all stated
 in my motion.” 
The circuit court did not rule at the hearing, and took
 
the matter under advisement. On June 3, 2008, the circuit court
 filed its Order Granting Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count I of
 Felony Indictment with Prejudice, which contained its Findings of
 
Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL). 
The circuit court’s relevant FOFs/COLs were as follows:

 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1.	 At approximately 1:14 a.m. on September 19,
2006, Tanaya [sic] Rapozo was driving a white
 
-7­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
pickup truck on Ala Wai Boulevard in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, when
she was pulled over by Honolulu Police Officer
Jason Pistor for driving erratically.
 
. . .
 
3.
	 Officer Pistor then placed the defendant under
arrest for driving under the influence and
without a driver’s license and took her to the
 Central Processing Desk of the main police
station.
 
4.	 At approximately 2:30 a.m. Ms. Rapozo was given
a pat down search by police matron Laura Chun
who felt something hard in defendant’s
brassiere.
 
5.	 Matron Chun escorted Ms. Rapozo into the holding
cell to conduct a more extensive
 preincarceration search and found a single .38
caliber operable bullet in the left cup of
defendant’s bra.
 
6.	 Ms. Rapozo’s explanation for possessing the
bullet was that she was going to have it made
into a charm for a bracelet.
 
7.	 No gun was found by either Matron Chun or police
officer Pistor, nor was any other ammunition,
drugs or other contraband found in defendant’s
possession or control.
 
8.	 Defendant, who has previously been convicted of
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle,
Promoting Dangerous Drugs in the Second Degree
and Theft in the Second Degree and is prohibited
from possessing or controlling a firearm and/or
ammunition, was arrested and charged under HRS §
4 
]
 134-7(b), a class B felony.[
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 
1.	 The purpose of HRS § 134-7(b) and (h) is to
 
4 Aside from FOFs 5 and 6, the circuit court’s FOFs were
unchallenged by the State, and are therefore binding on this court. See Kelly
 
v. 1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai' i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007 (2006).
In its Opening Brief to the ICA, the State challenged FOFs 5 and 6, insofar asthey characterized the item in Rapozo’s possession “as a ‘bullet,’ rather thanas a bullet cartridge or round or simply ammunition” because “[a] bullet doesnot contain explosives but is the solid projectile portion of ammunition thatis propelled from the firearm.” In its memorandum opinion, the ICA rejectedthe State’s contentions as unfounded because the circuit court characterized the bullet as “operable,” and it was therefore “sufficient to satisfy themeaning of ammunition under HRS § 134-7(b).” Given the ICA’s resolution of that issue, it does not appear that there is any further dispute that thebullet in Rapozo’s possession was “ammunition” within the meaning of HRS §134-7(b). 
-8­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
protect the public from criminal activity
involving the use of firearms by felons
convicted of certain crimes along with people
under judicial restraint by prohibiting these
individuals from possessing or controlling
firearms and/or ammunition. In this case, the
use of firearms and/or ammunition is not a
relevant factor in causing the situation that
led to defendant’s arrest.
 
2.	 Under HRS § 134-7(b) the possession of
ammunition in any amount is a violation. (See,
State v. Pinero, 70 Haw. 709, 778 P.2d 704
(1989)). However, the law does recognize that
under certain circumstances the infraction is so
 small as to make the penalty for the violation
of a particular statute unreasonable. HRS
 
Section 702-236. 
3.	 HRS Section 702-236 provides that the Court may
dismiss a prosecution if, considering all of the
relevant circumstances, it finds that the
defendant’s conduct did not actually cause or
threaten the harm sought to be prevented by the
law or did so only to an extent too trivial to
 warrant the condemnation of conviction. (See,
State v. Viernes, 92 Haw. 130, 988 P.2d 185
[sic] (1999); State v. Charmichael, 99 Haw. 75,
80, 53 P.3d 214, 219 (2002)).
 
4.	 Under the facts of this case, a single bullet
hidden from plain view in defendant’s bra,
without the capacity to fire it and which could
not be used to harm anyone, does not violate the
purpose of H.R.S. § 134-7(b); nor does it create
the danger the statute was designed to prevent.
 
5.	 Where an infraction is so infinitesimal that the
 possibility of the harm sought to be prevented
by a statute is minuscule, the violation may
constitute a “de minimus infraction” within the
 meaning of HRS 702-236. State v. Viernes, 92
Hawaii 30, 988 P.2d 185 [sic] (1999). In that
 event the Court in its sound discretion may
dismiss the prosecution brought against the
defendant for the statutory violation. Id.
 
6.	 Clearly, the defendant has met her burden of
showing that the de minimus statute applies.
Therefore, in the interest of justice, this
Court chooses to exercise the discretion
 provided by H.R.S. § 702-236 and the authorities
cited herein, to dismiss Count I of the
indictment with prejudice.
 
(Emphasis in original).
 
B.	 ICA Appeal
 
-9­  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In its October 29, 2008 Opening Brief to the ICA, the
 
State raised the following three points of error: 1) the circuit
 
court erred in entering FOFs 5 and 6; 2) the circuit court erred
 in entering COLs 1, 4 and 6; and 3) the circuit court abused its
 discretion in granting Rapozo’s motion to dismiss Count I as de
 minimis.
5
 
Specifically, the State challenged FOFs 5 and 6 insofar
 
as they characterized the item in Rapozo’s possession as a
 “bullet,” because “[a] bullet does not contain explosives but is
 the solid projectile portion of ammunition that is propelled from
 the firearm.” 
The State also argued that the circuit court erred in
 
COL 1 because, the State argued, the protection of law
 enforcement officers, correctional officers, jail staff and
 detainees was also an important purpose of HRS § 134-7. The
 State further argued that Rapozo had passively attempted to bring
 “live” ammunition into the police station holding facility, where
 she or another detainee could have used a “home made” gun or
 found some other means of discharging the bullet, and that she
 could have been charged with Promoting Prison Contraband in
 violation of HRS § 710-1022 (1993). 
The State challenged COL 4, contending that the circuit
 
5
 The State also pointed out that the circuit court, in FOF 8,
incorrectly described one of Rapozo’s prior convictions as “Promoting
Dangerous Drugs in the Second Degree, which would be a class B felony . . .
However, our records indicate and we believe Defendant will not contest that
the conviction was for Promoting Dangerous Drugs in the Third Degree.” 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court erroneously concluded that the bullet “could not be used to
 
harm anyone,” since, the State argued, the bullet was operable
 and could have been fired from a homemade device. In addition,
 the State challenged the conclusion that Rapozo’s possession of a
 single bullet “does not violate the purpose of H.R.S. § 134-7(b);
 nor does it create the danger the statute was designed to
 prevent,” where Rapozo’s possession of a single bullet fell
 within the statute’s prohibition against the possession of “any”
 ammunition. The State further challenged the circuit court’s COL
 4 insofar as it characterized the item in Rapozo’s possession as
 a bullet. 
Finally, the State challenged COL 6's conclusion that
 
Rapozo had met her burden of proof in showing that the de minimis
 statute applied, on the basis that she failed to adduce any
 evidence that the bullet was not capable of being fired or
 otherwise exploded. 
In her answering brief, Rapozo argued that the circuit
 
court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the charge as de
 minimis, because the use of firearms and/or ammunition was not a
 relevant factor in the situation leading to her arrest, and
 because her conduct did not cause or threaten the harm sought to
 be prevented by HRS § 134-7. 
In its April 20, 2009 memorandum opinion, the ICA
 
rejected the State’s argument concerning the circuit court’s
 characterization of the item in Rapozo’s possession as a “bullet”
 
-11­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as unfounded because the circuit court described the bullet as
 
“operable,” and it was therefore “sufficient to satisfy the
 meaning of ammunition under HRS § 134-7(b).” State v. Rapozo,
 
No. 28215, 2009 WL 1090068 at *2 (App. Apr. 20, 2009) (mem.).
 
Concerning the State’s challenge to COL 1, the ICA
 
noted that the circuit court correctly concluded that the purpose
 
of HRS § 134-7(b) was to “prevent . . . the commission of crimes
 
by convicted felons by prohibiting their possession or control of
 firearms and/or ammunition.” Id. at *3. However, the ICA held
 
that the circuit court disregarded a rule or principle of law in
 concluding “that the use of firearms and/or ammunition was not a
 relevant fact in causing ‘the situation’ that led to Rapozo’s
 arrest,” because “the situation” leading to her arrest on Count I
 of the felony indictment was her possession of the bullet. Id.
 
The ICA further concluded that:
 
The statute does not require proof that the convicted
felon used or was about to use the firearm or
 ammunition. The statute was based on the premise that
a felon’s possession of a firearm or ammunition “gives
rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person
might use such firearms [or ammunition] for criminal
and violent purposes.” See 1968 Haw. Sess. Laws, Act
19, [§ 1 at 23] . . . . The court disregarded this
principle of law when it based its finding on the
absence of evidence that the ammunition was used or
 about to be used.
 
Id.
 
Similarly, the ICA concluded that the circuit court
 
erred in COLs 4 and 6 because “[t]he circumstances of this case,
 
i.e., that there was only one bullet, it was hidden in Rapozo’s
 bra, and Rapozo did not also possess a firearm or other means of
 
-12­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
firing the bullet, do not negate the public safety purpose of the
 
clear statutory mandate that convicted felons are not allowed to
 possess any firearms or ammunition.” Id.
 
The ICA distinguished the possession of a single bullet 
from the possession of 0.001 grams of methamphetamine, which this court addressed in State v. Viernes, 92 Hawai
'i 130, 988 P.2d 195 
(1999) (affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the charge of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree as de minimis). Rapozo, 2009 WL 1090068 at *4. The ICA concluded that, unlike 0.001 grams of methamphetamine, which “would not cause a
 physiological effect on a human body and was not of a saleable
 amount . . . [i]t is without question that one live .38 caliber
 bullet is exactly the sort of ammunition that could kill or
 seriously injure a human being.” Id.
 
The ICA further concluded that Rapozo failed to meet her
 
burden of proof in showing that the de minimis statute applied
 because her proffered explanation for her possession of the
 bullet, i.e., that she intended to use it as a charm for a
 bracelet, was “better characterized as a defense of
 justification. . . . Assertion of a justification defense should
 be made and considered by the trier-of-fact at trial.” Id.
 
Finally, the ICA held that the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in granting Rapozo’s motion to dismiss the charge as de
 minimis. Id.
 On June 5, 2009, the ICA entered its Judgment on Appeal. 
-13­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On September 1, 2009, Rapozo timely petitioned this court for a
 
writ of certiorari to review the ICA’s June 5, 2009 judgment. The
 
State did not file a response.
 
II. Standards of Review
 
A. De Minimis Infraction
 
“The dismissal of a prosecution for a de minimis 
infraction . . . is not a defense. The authority to dismiss a 
prosecution [as de minimis] rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.” Viernes, 92 Hawai
'i at 133, 988 P.2d at 198 
(quoting State v. Ornellas, 79 Hawai 'i 418, 420, 903 P.2d 723, 725 
(App. 1995)). “A court abuses its discretion if it clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.” State v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai
'i 244, 253, 54 P.3d 415, 
424 (2002) (quoting State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai 'i 279, 283, 1 P.3d 
281, 285 (2000)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
B. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
A circuit court’s findings of fact and conclusions of
 
law are reviewed as follows:
 
[A] trial court’s findings of fact are subject to
the clearly erroneous standard of review. A finding of
fact is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to
support the finding, the appellate court is left with a
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
 committed. 
A conclusion of law is not binding upon an
appellate court and is freely reviewable for its
correctness. This court ordinarily reviews conclusions
of law under the right/wrong standard. Thus, a
conclusion of law that is supported by the trial
court’s findings of fact and that reflects an
application of the correct rule of law will not be
 
-14­   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
overturned. However, a conclusion of law that presents
mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the
clearly erroneous standard because the court’s
conclusions are dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of each individual case.
 
State v. Gabalis, 83 Hawai 'i 40, 46, 924 P.2d 534, 540 (1996) 
(citations, internal quotation marks, brackets and ellipses 
omitted). 
III. Discussion
 
Rapozo’s possession of a single operable bullet is 
within the scope of HRS § 134-7(b)’s clear prohibition against her possessing “any . . . ammunition.” Nevertheless, her conduct may still constitute a de minimis infraction under HRS § 702-236(1)(b) if it “did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense,” see Viernes, 92 Hawai
'i at 134, 988 P.2d at 199, or did so to an extent “too 
trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction,” see State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 77, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992). 
We begin our analysis by examining the history of
 
Hawaii’s de minimus statute and the principles applicable to
 deciding motions under the statute. We then examine the purpose
 of HRS § 134-7(b). Finally, we consider whether Rapozo’s conduct
 caused or threatened the harm sought to be prevented by the
 statute, or whether it did so only to a trivial extent.
 
We note that although we reach the same result as the
 
ICA, we diverge from its analysis in several respects. For
 example, the ICA concluded that the circuit court erred in
 
-15­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
observing that “the use of firearms and/or ammunition was not a
 
relevant fact in causing ‘the situation’ that led to Rapozo’s
 arrest,” and for relying on the fact that no firearm was recovered
 from Rapozo at the time of her arrest. However, when the FOF/COL
 are read in their entirety, it is apparent that the circuit court
 did not misapprehend the law; rather, the circuit court viewed the
 circumstances under which Rapozo initially came to the attention
 of police, and the fact that no firearms were recovered from her,
 as mitigating factors in assessing the extent of Rapozo’s
 culpability. As we discuss below, the court must take the nature
 of the conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant
 circumstances into account. Thus, we cannot say that, as a matter
 of law, it was improper for the circuit court to take those
 factors into consideration. 
The ICA also concluded that Rapozo’s explanation for
 
possessing the bullet “is better characterized as a defense of
 justification as to her possession.” However, as we discuss
 below, Rapozo was required to address the nature of her conduct
 and the attendant circumstances in order to meet her burden of
 establishing that her conduct constituted a de minimis infraction. 
Thus, Rapozo’s explanation is relevant to the determination of
 whether she has carried that burden, and it was therefore
 appropriate for the circuit court to consider it.

A.	 General principles applicable to determining motions brought
under HRS § 702-236
 
Hawaii’s de minimis statute was adopted in 1972, and was
 
based on section 2.12 of the 1962 version of the Model Penal Code. 
1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 50-51; Commentary to HRS § 702­
6	 7 
236. With one exception,  Hawai'i adopted the MPC provision in 
its entirety. The explanatory note to the MPC explains that “[s]ection 2.12 authorizes courts to exercise a power inherent in other agencies of criminal justice to ignore merely technical violations of law.” 1 American Law Institute, 
Model Penal Code 
and Commentaries § 2.12 at 399 (1962). The comment to section 2.12 notes that “[t]he purpose of this section of the Code is to
 recognize the propriety of judicial discretion of this sort, and
 at the same time set forth the basis upon which it can reasonably
 be used[,]” id. at 402 (footnote omitted), and adds that
 “[a]melioration of the letter of the law is both necessary and
 inevitable, but at the same time should be the product of law
 rather than seemingly in its defiance[,]” id. at 404.
 
6 The Commentary to HRS § 702-236 states that HRS § 702-236 was
patterned after § 2.13 of the MPC. However, this appears to be an error. MPC
 
§ 2.12 is the de minimis provision. 1 American Law Institute, Model Penal
 Code and Commentaries § 2.12 at 399.

 While section 2.12 of the MPC provides that a court “shall”
dismiss a prosecution if it finds that the offense was de minimis, the
legislature instead provided that the court “may” dismiss in such
circumstances. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 50; Supplemental Commentary
to HRS § 702-236 (quoting Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 2, in 1972 Senate Journal,
at 741). In other words, the court can decline to dismiss a prosecution even
if the de minimis statute is otherwise satisfied. The conference committee
 report explained that “[i]t is your [c]ommittee’s intent to give the courts
broad discretion in this matter.” Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 2-72, in 1972
Senate Journal, at 741. 
-17­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Consistent with that intent, HRS § 702-236 provides that 
“[t]he court may dismiss a prosecution if, having regard to the 
nature of the conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant’s conduct” constituted a de minimis infraction. HRS § 702-236(1) (emphasis added). Thus, we require that all of the relevant attendant circumstances be considered by the trial court. See Viernes, 92 Hawai
'i at 133, 
988 P.2d at 198 (“before [HRS § 702-236] can be properly applied in a criminal case, all of the relevant facts bearing on the defendant’s conduct and the nature of the attendant circumstances regarding the commission of the offense should be shown to the judge so that the judge may consider all of the facts on this issue”) (internal citations, parenthesis and quotation marks omitted); State v. Fukagawa, 100 Hawai
'i 498, 504, 60 P.3d 899, 
905 (2002) (“Dismissing a charge without any indicators from the surrounding circumstances to demonstrate a de minimis infraction would be an abuse of discretion.”). 
The defendant has the burden of bringing the relevant 
attendant circumstances before the court for its consideration. See, e.g., State v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai
'i at 256, 54 P.3d at 427 
(2002) (“[I]nsofar as the defendant advances a motion to dismiss on de minimis grounds, it is the defendant, and not the prosecution, who bears the burden of proof on the issue.”) (emphasis in original). 
In addition to requiring consideration of all the
 
-18­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
relevant attendant circumstances, HRS § 702-236 further requires 
consideration of “the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense[.]” HRS § 702-236; see State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992); State v. Ornellas, 79 Hawai
'i 418, 422-23, 903 P.2d 723, 727-28 (App. 1995). As with 
all efforts to determine legislative intent, that inquiry relies primarily on the plain language of the statute. State v. Kupihea, 
98 Hawai
'i 196, 206, 46 P.3d 498, 508 (2002) (“[O]ur duty in 
interpreting statutes is to give effect to the legislature’s intent[,] which is obtained primarily from the language of the statute.”) (citation omitted) (brackets in original); Akina, 73 Haw. at 78, 828 P.2d at 271 (applying HRS § 702-236 to a charge brought under a particular statute, and noting that “[t]his court derives legislative intent primarily from the language of [the] statute and follows the general rule that in the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary, the plain meaning of the statute will be given effect”); Ornellas, 79 Hawai
'i at 423, 903 
P.2d at 728 (applying HRS § 702-236 to an abuse of a family member case, ICA cites Akina and notes “[a]s evidenced by the language of HRS § 709-906, the purpose of the statute is to protect household members from physical abuse”). We therefore respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion that “the legislative intent cannot be discerned by looking directly to the language of the statute itself.” Dissenting opinion at 20. 
In Kupihea, the defendant was convicted of, inter alia,
 
-19­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prohibited acts relating to drug paraphernalia, in violation of 
HRS § 329-43.5(a) (1993), in relation to his possession of “a green plastic container and/or a clear plastic ziploc bag.” 98 Hawai
'i at 198, 200, 46 P.3d at 500, 502 (emphasis omitted). 
Kupihea argued that the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss the charge as de minimis because “the items were everyday household items not intended or designed for use as drug paraphernalia[.]” Id. at 206, 46 P.3d at 508 (brackets in the 
original). In support of his argument, Kupihea relied on “comments of a legislator favoring passage of HRS § 329-43.5” concerning “‘head shops[,]’” and “[pipes] made for marijuana, for cocaine, for heroin, and all the assorted paraphernalia that accompany that.” Id. (brackets in the original). Accordingly, 
Kupihea argued, “the ziploc bag and the plastic candy container did not actually threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense, [that is], preventing the sale of items specifically designed or intended for use as drug paraphernalia.” Id. (brackets in original). 
In discerning the harm or evil sought to be prevented
 
by HRS § 329-43.5, this court relied on the plain language of the
 statute, noting that “[w]e do not resort to legislative history
 to cloud a statutory text that is clear.” Id. (emphasis added)
 
(citation and quotation marks omitted). We further noted that
 “[o]ur duty in interpreting statutes is to give effect to the
 legislature’s intent[,] which is obtained primarily from the
 
-20­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
language of the statute.” Id. (some brackets in original and
 
some added) (emphasis added) (citations and quotation marks
 
omitted). 
Applying these principles to HRS § 329-43.5, we
 
concluded that “[Kupihea’s] possession involved the harm or evil
 sought to be prevented by HRS § 329-43.5[,]” id. at 207, 46 P.3d
 at 509, noting that:
 
HRS § 329-43.5 states in relevant part . . . that
“[i]t is unlawful for any person to use, or to possess
with intent to use, drug paraphernalia to pack, store,
contain, [or] conceal a controlled substance” such as
methamphetamine. Furthermore, as we have observed, HRS
§ 329-1 defines drug paraphernalia as including “all
materials of any kind which are used in storing a
controlled substance not limited to envelopes[ ] and
other containers used in packaging small quantities of
controlled substances.” (Emphases added.) It is
evident that, in enacting HRS § 329-1, the legislature
cast a wide net, ensnaring not only containers that
might ordinarily be thought of as used for “packaging
small quantities of drugs,” but anything used or
possessed with the intent to use it for the proscribed
 purposes.
 
Id. at 206, 46 P.3d at 508 (ellipses omitted) (brackets in
 
original).
 
Similarly, in Akina, the defendant was charged with
 
custodial interference after assisting Sue, a ward of the State
 who had run away from her foster parents. 73 Haw. at 76-77, 828
 P.2d at 270-71. The defendant, Sue’s foster father, and the
 prosecutor all agreed that Akina was trying to help Sue. Id. 
Nevertheless, the circuit court denied Akina’s motion to dismiss
 the charge as de minimis, reasoning that Akina’s actions fell
 within the plain meaning of the statute and that convicting Akina
 would comply with legislative intent. Id. at 77, 828 P.2d at
 
-21­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
271. 
Akina argued to this court that his conduct fell within
 
the de minimis provision because the legislative history of HRS §
 
707-727(1)(a), under which he was charged, “show[ed] that the
 statute was only intended to prevent child snatching, that is,
 interference of custody awarded upon divorce.” Id. at 78, 828
 
P.2d at 271. This court disagreed, noting that “[t]his court
 derives legislative intent primarily from the language of statute
 and follows the general rule that in the absence of clear
 legislative intent to the contrary, the plain meaning of the
 statute will be given effect.” Id. We found “no evidence of
 
clear legislative intent either in the statute or legislative
 history to limit application of the statute to the divorce
 context.” Id. at 79, 828 P.2d at 272. Accordingly, this court
 
concluded that Akina’s conduct fell within the plain meaning of
 the statute, but nevertheless held that the circuit court abused
 its discretion in denying Akina’s motion to dismiss because
 Akina’s conduct was “too trivial to warrant the condemnation of
 conviction.” Id. (citing HRS § 702-236(1)(b)). 
Likewise, in Ornellas, the defendant was convicted of 
abuse of a family and household member in violation of HRS § 709­906 (Supp. 1992), which provided, in pertinent part, that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person . . . to physically abuse a family or household member[.]” 79 Hawai
'i at 420 n.1, 903 P.2d 
at 725 n.1. The ICA determined that, “[a]s evidenced by the 
-22­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
language of HRS § 709-906, the purpose of the statute is to
 
protect household members from physical abuse. In essence, HRS §
 709-906 seeks to prevent violence between those persons denoted
 as ‘household members.’” Id. at 423, 903 P.2d at 728 (emphasis
 
added) (citations omitted). 
B.	 The purpose of the prohibition in HRS § 134-7(b) is to
reduce the risk that persons convicted of certain crimes
will commit further crimes using firearms
 
HRS § 134-7 provides, in relevant part:
 
Ownership or possession prohibited, when; penalty
 
. . .
 (b)	 No person who is under indictment for, or has
waived indictment for, or has been bound over to
the circuit court for, or has been convicted in
this State or elsewhere of having committed a
felony, or any crime of violence, or an illegal
sale of any drug shall own, possess, or control
any firearm or ammunition therefor.
 
. . .
 
The statutory language explicitly proscribes the
 
possession of “any firearm or ammunition” by a person convicted
 
of a felony. HRS § 134-7(b) (emphasis added). The statute
 reflects the determination by the legislature that the possession
 of firearms or ammunition by certain categories of people raises
 an unacceptable risk that those items will be used for unlawful
 purposes. As set forth below, the legislature has, over the
 years, expanded the scope of the statute by broadening the
 categories of both prohibited persons and prohibited items. 
Moreover, the legislative history of HRS § 134-7(b) reflects the
 legislature’s belief that the possession of any firearm or
 ammunition by a felon raises an unacceptable risk that such
 
-23­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
firearms or ammunition will be used for “criminal and violent
 
purposes.” See 1968 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 19, § 1 at 23.
 
The origins of HRS § 134-7 were discussed by the ICA in
 
State v. Auwae, 89 Hawai 'i 59, 968 P.2d 1070 (App. 1998), 
overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Jenkins, 93
 Hawai
'i 87, 997 P.2d 13 (2000): 
The first Hawai' i law prohibiting certain convicted
persons from owning or possessing certain firearms was
enacted in 1927 by the Territory of Hawai' i 
Legislature (the Territorial legislature) as section 4of Act 206 of the 1927 Session Laws: 
Section 4. Persons forbidden to possess small
 arms. No person who has been convicted in this
territory or elsewhere, of having committed or
attempted a crime of violence, shall own or have
in his possession or under his control, a pistol
or revolver.
 
1927 Sess. L., Act 206, § 4, at 209 (emphasis added).
In 1933, the legislature amended the 1927 Sess. L.,
Act 206, § 4 to read, “No person who has been
convicted . . . of having committed or attempted a
crime of violence, shall own or have in his possession
or under his control a pistol or revolver or
ammunition therefor.” 1933-34 Sess. L., Act 26, § 6,
at 38. . . . The legislature did not specifically
. . . comment on the addition of the words “or
 ammunition therefor.”
 
Id. at 68, 968 P.2d at 1079 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in
 
original).
 
Act 206 was subsequently codified in Revised Laws of
 
Hawai'i (RLH) 1935 § 2545. Id. The statute was subsequently 
amended on multiple occasions, including in 1951, when the
 category of persons who were prohibited from possessing firearms
 was expanded to include any person who had been convicted of “the
 illegal use, possession or sale of narcotics[.]” 1951 Haw. Sess.
 Laws Act 253, § 1 at 422; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 490, in 1951
 
-24­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Senate Journal, at 1079 (“The purpose of this bill is to
 
prohibit the ownership or possession of any firearm or ammunition
 by a person convicted of the illegal use, possession, or sale of
 narcotics. The existing statute is aimed at any person convicted
 of a crime of violence or any attempt thereto.”).
 
By 1965, the statute had been renumbered as RLH § 157­
7, and read, in pertinent part: 
No person who has been convicted in this State or
elsewhere, of having committed or attempted a crime of
violence, or of the illegal use, possession or sale of
narcotics, shall own or have in his possession or
under his control any firearm or ammunition therefor.
 
RLH 1965 § 157-7(b).
 
In 1968, RLH § 157-7 was recodified by Act 19 as HRS §
 
134-7 (1968). Act 19 made violation of the statute a felony,
 
rather than a misdemeanor. 1968 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 19, § 2 at
 24; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 321, in 1968 House Journal, at 367. 
In the text of Act 19, the legislature provided a statement
 concerning the purpose of the Act, which clearly identified the
 legislature’s concern with violent gun crimes:
 
During recent years, there has been an alarming
increase in the number of crimes involving the use of
firearms in the State of Hawaii. Up to two years ago
the number of armed robberies was few in comparison to
the total number of robberies of all kinds and the use
 or possession of firearms by other arrestees was very
few in number.
 
Since the possession of firearms and/or
ammunition by persons having a prior record of
convictions for crimes of violence gives rise to a
reasonable apprehension that such persons might use
such firearms for criminal and violent purposes,
legislation prohibiting the possession or control of
firearms by such persons and making such possession a
felony is urgent and necessary for protection of the
general public.
 
-25­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1968 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 19, § 1 at 23 (emphasis added).
 
In 1971, the legislature expanded HRS § 134-7(b) to
 
include all convicted felons. 1971 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1
 
at 196; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 524, in 1971 Sen. Journal, at
 1036-37; see also State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai
'i 507, 535, 928 P.2d 
1, 29 (1996) (“The Hawai 'i legislature has indicated that HRS § 
134-7 applies to all convicted felons.”) (emphasis in original). 
Also in 1971, the legislature added a provision to HRS § 134-7
 that imposed a mandatory minimum sentence for the possession of
 any firearms or ammunition by a convicted felon.
8 1971 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1 at 196. In its report on the bill that
 added the provision, the Senate Committee on Judiciary noted:
 
it is your committee’s considered decision and opinion
that in this one area of the law, namely the
prevention of crimes involving illegal possession or
use of firearms, the law must be strengthened
immediately, and that these amendments, although
drastic are justified and necessary for the protection
and safety of the law-abiding citizens and residents
of this State.
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 524, in 1971 Sen. Journal, at 1036-37.
 
The House Judiciary Committee described the 1971
 
amendments as “amend[ing] the existing firearms laws so that they
 
will be more effective in deterring and preventing the

 The provision requiring a mandatory minimum sentence was removed
in 1975, and violation of HRS § 134-7 was made a class C felony. 1975 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 24, § 4 at 34. In 1981, HRS § 134-7 was amended to provide
that “any felon violating subsection 134-7(b) shall be guilty of a class B
felony.” 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 239, § 5 at 466. However, the legislative
history concerning Act 239 is silent on the reason for the 1981 change. See
 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 48, in 1981 House Journal, at 922; S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
No. 847, in 1981 Senate Journal, at 1274-75; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 727, in
1981 House Journal, at 1241-42.

proliferation of crimes involving the illegal possession and use
 
of firearms in the State of Hawaii.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 931, in 1971 House Journal, at 1102. Moreover, this court has
 recognized that HRS § 134-7(b) is intended to prevent gun crimes
 by felons by prohibiting the possession of firearms and
 ammunition by such persons:
 
[N]oting that “[l]icensed or registered firearms
owners very seldom commit crimes with their guns,” the1971 Hawai' i legislature targeted severe punishment
such as a “mandatory sentence of not less than oneyear” specifically at all “persons convicted of anyfelony . . . possessing any firearms or ammunition[.]”Having “come to the conclusion that severe penaltiesand incarceration must be adopted as the onlymeaningful method of stopping gun crimes[,]” theHawai'i legislature’s purpose for HRS § 134-7(b) has
clearly been to keep firearms and ammunition out ofthe hands of anyone who has “committed a felony[.]” 
Samonte, 83 Hawai 'i at 535, 928 P.2d at 29 (quoting S. Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 524, in 1971 Senate Journal, at 1036) (internal 
citations omitted) (some brackets in original and some added) (emphasis in original). 
C.	 Rapozo’s conduct threatened the harm or evil sought to be
prevented by HRS § 134-7(b)
 
The plain language of the statute and its legislative
 
history support the conclusion that Rapozo’s status (convicted
 
felon, including a conviction for promoting dangerous drugs) and
 her conduct (concealed possession of a live bullet for the
 asserted purpose of making it into a charm for a bracelet)
 “actually cause[d] or threaten[ed] the harm or evil sought to be
 prevented by” HRS § 134-7(b). In reaching that conclusion, it is
 instructive to compare the circumstances of the instant case with
 
-27­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
those presented in Viernes.
 
In Viernes, we affirmed the circuit court’s order
 
granting Viernes’s motion to dismiss the charge of promoting a
 
dangerous drug in the third degree, in violation of HRS § 712­
9
1243, as de minimis, despite the statute’s explicit prohibition
against the possession of “any dangerous drug in any amount.” 92 Hawai
'i at 130-31, 988 P.2d at 195-96. Viernes had been placed 
under arrest for having threatened to harm his wife, and was found in possession of two small plastic packets, one of which contained 0.001 grams of a substance containing methamphetamine. 
Id.
 at 131, 988 P.2d at 196. Relying on State v. Vance, 61 Haw. 
291, 307, 602 P.2d 933, 944 (1979),10 this court held that: 
an offense may be de minimis where it did not actually
cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be
prevented by the law defining the offense. Under
 certain circumstances, this may, . . . trump the “any
amount” requirement of HRS § 712-1243. 
Viernes, 92 Hawai 'i at 134, 988 P.2d at 199 (quoting HRS § 702­
236) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). 
We concluded that the purpose of the prohibition
 
against the possession of “any dangerous drug in any amount”
 
9 HRS § 712-1243 (1993 & Supp. 1998) provided in relevant part:
 
(1)	 A person commits the offense of promoting
a dangerous drug in the third degree if
the person knowingly possesses any
dangerous drug in any amount.
 
In Vance, this court declined to apply the de minimis provision to
 
a prosecution for the possession of .7584 grams of a substance containing
cocaine and three tablets of secobarbital. 61 Haw. at 307, 602 P.2d at 944.
However, this court noted that, in the context of the possession of trace
amounts of drugs, “where a literal application of HRS § 712-1243 would compel
an unduly harsh conviction . . . ‘De minimis infractions’ may be applicable to
mitigate this result.” Id. 
-28­10 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under HRS § 712-1243 was “to respond to abuse and social harm,” 
and “to counter increased property and violent crimes.” 92 Hawai
'i at 134, 988 P.2d at 199 (quoting H. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 
1, in 1972 House Journal, at 1050 and 1996 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 308, at 970) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Viernes’s conduct fell within the explicit scope of the statute, Viernes presented expert testimony that 0.001 grams of methamphetamine was not a sufficient quantity to “be sold or used in such a way as to have any discernable effect on the human body.” Id. at 134, 988 P.2d at 199. We concluded that, “if the 
quantity of a controlled substance is so minuscule that it cannot be sold or used . . . , it follows that the drug cannot lead to abuse, social harm, or property and violent crimes.” Id. We 
accordingly held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the charge, even though the alleged conduct violated the statute, because the minuscule quantity Viernes possessed could not “lead to abuse, social harm, or property and violent crimes.” Id. at 134, 988 P.2d at 199. 
Viernes is distinguishable from the instant case. 
Whereas Viernes involved an amount of prohibited substance too
 minuscule to cause or threaten the harm the statute sought to
 prevent, id., the instant case involves the possession of an
 operable bullet with the potential to kill or seriously injure a
 human being, to cause other physical harm, or to be used in the
 commission of a crime. The possession of a live bullet by a
 
-29­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
convicted felon under the circumstances presented here directly 
implicates the precise harm that the legislature sought to avoid in enacting HRS § 134-7(b). It was the legislature’s judgment that the possession of firearms or ammunition by such persons posed an unreasonable risk that they would be used in “gun crimes.” Samonte, 83 Hawai
'i at 535, 928 P.2d at 29 (quoting S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 524, in 1971 Senate Journal, at 1036). 
We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s assertion
 
that Rapozo “did not actually cause or threaten [the] harm which
 HRS § 134-7 seeks to prevent” because (1) she lacked the means of
 firing the bullet, and (2) she had not been convicted of a
 violent crime. Dissenting opinion at 13-14, 22-23. As we
 acknowledge above, supra page 17, the first point was a relevant
 factor for the circuit court to take into consideration in
 determining Rapozo’s culpability. However, it is not
 dispositive. Otherwise, only felons who possess both guns and
 ammunition would be of concern to the legislature, a result which
 is inconsistent both with the plain language and legislative
 history of HRS § 134-7(b).
 
Nor do we agree that the legislature was not
 
“manifestly concerned” with Rapozo because she had not been
 convicted of a violent felony. Dissenting opinion at 22. That
 interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the
 statute, as it has evolved over time. As noted above, that
 evolution reflects a steady expansion of the scope of the
 
-30­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statute, culminating in the decision in 1971 to prohibit “all”
 
felons from possessing firearms or ammunition. That history does
 not suggest that the legislature inadvertently cast too wide a
 net in 1971, but rather that it made a considered judgment, based
 on decades of experience under the predecessor versions of the
 statute, that “all” convicted felons were of concern.
 
The dissent arrives at its narrow interpretation of the
 
purpose of HRS § 134-7(b) by focusing on one passage from the
 preamble to the 1968 Act that discussed the risk posed by felons
 who had been convicted of violent crimes. Dissenting opinion at
 7-8, 14-15. With all due respect, this focus on a piece of the
 legislative history to the exclusion of the plain language of the
 statute is contrary to the approach taken by this court in Akina
 and Kupihea, and by the ICA in Ornellas, all of which emphasized
 the importance of the plain language of the statute.
 
Moreover, even if the analytical approach suggested by
 
the dissent was valid, the result it reaches is nevertheless
 incorrect. The same section of the 1968 Act cited by the dissent
 notes that, in addition to persons convicted of violent crimes,
 there was another category of person that was of particular
 concern to the legislature:
 
Further, the amendment of section [134-7] is necessary
for uniformity of legislation to include those persons
convicted of crimes involving the possession or sale
of depressant or stimulant drugs to the class of
persons prohibited from the ownership or possession of
firearms as previous legislatures had done for those
convicted of narcotics offenses; it is a fact that
these classes of offenders are particularly dangerous
when they are apprehended or when they are under the
 
-31­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
influence of narcotics or drugs, and must therefore be
prevented from possession of firearms for the public
interest.
 
1968 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 19, § 1 at 23.
 
Although the legislature subsequently amended HRS §
 
134-7(b) in 1980 “to remove from the scope of section 134-7 those
 
who have been convicted of the use or possession of drugs, unless
 such conviction is a felony[,]” the legislature made clear its
 intention that the “use or possession of prohibited drugs[,]”
 where such use or possession results in a felony conviction,
 would remain within the prohibitions of HRS § 134-7(b).
11 See
 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 30-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 955; 1980
 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 233, § 1 at 411. 
Rapozo, who had a prior felony conviction for third-
degree promotion of dangerous drugs, fits squarely within this
 category of offenders that was of particular concern to the
 legislature. Thus, even if one accepts the dissent’s view that
 it is appropriate to limit the purpose of the statute to those
 concerns that were specifically identified in the legislative
 history, Rapozo fits within this core purpose of HRS § 134-7(b).
 
11
 The dissent asserts that “[p]ersons convicted of possession or use
of drugs, where such conviction is a felony, fall within the scope of HRS §
134-7 not because the legislature was specifically concerned with such
persons, but because HRS § 134-7 prohibits all felons, whether or not the
conviction is drug-related, from possessing ammunition or firearms.”
Dissenting opinion at 28. However, the dissent’s assertion is inconsistent
with the express statement of the legislature that “the mere use or possession
of prohibited drugs, unless the amount used or possessed constitutes a felony,
do not warrant prosecution.” Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 30-80, in 1980 Senate
Journal, at 955.

D.	 Rapozo failed to carry her burden of demonstrating that her
possession of a bullet was too trivial to warrant the
condemnation of conviction
 
In State v. Park, 55 Haw. 610, 616, 525 P.2d 589, 591
 
(1974), this court considered the applicability of the de minimis
 
statute to charges against a number of candidates for failing to
 timely file campaign expense reports. We noted that:
 
We think that before [HRS § 702-236] can be properly
applied in a criminal case, all of the relevant facts
bearing upon the defendant’s conduct and the nature of
the attendant circumstances regarding the commission
of the offense should be shown to the judge. Such a
 disclosure would then enable the judge to consider all
of the facts on this issue, so that he can
intelligently exercise a sound discretion, consistent
with the public interest, whether to grant the
dismissal of a criminal case[.]
 
Id. at 616, 525 at 591 (emphasis added). 
In addition, this court outlined a number of factors
 
for the trial court to consider in making its determination,
 
including (1) the background, experience and character of the
 defendant; (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant of the
 consequences of the act; (3) the circumstances surrounding the
 offense; (4) the harm or evil caused or threatened by the
 offense; (5) the probable impact of the offense on the community;
 (6) the seriousness of the punishment; (7) the mitigating
 circumstances; (8) possible improper motives of the complainant
 or prosecutor; (9) “any other data which may reveal the nature
 and degree of the culpability in the offense committed by each
 defendant[.]” Id.; see also State v. Cabana, 716 A.2d 576, 579
 
(N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1997) (defendant’s conduct “under the
 
-33­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
de minimis statute is not viewed in isolation, but coupled with
 
the surrounding circumstances which play an integral part herein
 to explain the what, why and how of defendant’s intent.”). 
Because the district court in Park failed to take those factors
 into account in dismissing the charges as de minimis, we reversed
 its dismissal of the charges, noting:
 
[T]he district court did not consider the merits of
this issue on an individual basis. . . . The record in
 each case is utterly bare of the attendant
circumstances surrounding these violations. Under the
 circumstances, we think it was an abuse of discretion
to dismiss the charges as de minimis infractions
without any indicators to show that each of these
offenses was in fact an innocent, technical
infraction, not actually causing or threatening any
harm or evil sought to be prevented by [the statute
under which the defendants were charged], or that the
harm or evil caused or threatened was [too] trivial to
warrant the condemnation of conviction.
 
Park, 55 Haw. at 617-18, 525 P.2d at 591-92.
 
In State v. Fukagawa, 100 Hawai 'i 498, 506-07, 60 P.3d 
899, 907-08 (2002), this court affirmed an order of the trial
 
court denying Fukagawa’s motion to dismiss as de minimis a charge
 of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree. The trial
 court found that the amount of substance containing
 methamphetamine that Fukagawa possessed could have an effect on
 the nervous system or mind, and was therefore not de minimis. 
Id. at 503, 60 P.3d at 904. We noted that in making a motion to
 dismiss an offense as de minimis, 
[T]he defendant bears the burden of establishing that
“his or her conduct neither caused nor threatened to
 cause the harm or evil that the statute, under which
he or she is charged, seeks to prevent.” In advancing
a motion to dismiss a charge as a de minimis offense,
the defendant must address both “the nature of the
 conduct alleged and the nature of the attendant
 
-34­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circumstances.” Further, . . . dismissal of a
prosecution without any indicators from the
surrounding circumstances that demonstrate a de
minimis infraction would constitute an abuse of
 discretion.
 
Id. at 507, 60 P.3d at 908 (citations omitted) (emphasis in 
original); see State v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai 'i at 256, 54 P.3d at 
427 (noting that “insofar as the defendant advances a motion to dismiss on de minimis grounds, it is the defendant, and not the prosecution, who bears the burden of proof on the issue”) (emphasis in original). 
Moreover, we noted that “quantity is only one of the
 
surrounding circumstances a court must consider.” Id. at 505, 60
 
P.3d at 906 (citing Vance, 61 Haw. at 307, 602 P.2d at 944). We
 held that Fukagawa’s assertion that his conduct was de minimis
 failed because “the defense focused solely upon the amount of
 methamphetamine possessed and presented neither testimony nor
 other evidence regarding the circumstances attendant to
 Fukagawa’s possession of drug paraphernalia and the substance
 containing methamphetamine.” Id. at 507, 60 P.3d at 908. Thus,
 
“[i]n light of the defendant’s burden to prove that his conduct
 constituted a de minimis infraction and the evidence adduced in
 this case,” we held that the trial court did not abuse its
 discretion in denying the motion. Id. 
In State v. Carmichael, 99 Hawai
'i 75, 76, 53 P.3d 214, 
215 (2002), the defendant was pulled over by police who observed him traveling between 84 and 86 mph in an area with a 30 mph 
-35­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
speed limit. He smelled of alcohol, was unsteady on his feet,
 
slurred his words, and gave inconsistent answers regarding the
 amount he had been drinking. Id. He was arrested and taken to
 
the police station, where a glass pipe containing a white
 crystalline substance, two metal scrapers, a small plastic straw,
 and “several ziplock bags containing a light rock residue visible
 to the naked eye” were found in his sock. Id. Carmichael was
 
charged with, inter alia, promoting a dangerous drug in the third
 degree under HRS § 712-1243, and the circuit court declined to
 dismiss that charge as de minimis. Id. at 77, 53 P.3d at 216.
 
On appeal, this court affirmed. In a plurality
 
opinion, Chief Justice Moon observed that “the defendant bears
 the burden of establishing that the conduct constituted a de
 minimis infraction[,]” and must “adduce evidence regarding both
 the conduct alleged and the attendant circumstances in order to
 support a finding that the alleged conduct was de minimis.” Id.
 
at 80, 53 P.3d at 219 (opinion of Moon, C.J., and Nakayama, J.)
 (citation omitted). The plurality noted that at both the hearing
 on his motion to dismiss and on appeal, Carmichael focused his
 argument exclusively on whether the amount of drugs in his
 possession constituted a useable amount, and “did not adduce any
 evidence or present any argument with respect to the attendant
 circumstances,” namely Carmichael’s possession of multiple items
 associated with the use and distribution of methamphetamine, his
 driving at excessive speed, and the arresting officer’s
 
-36­      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
determination that Carmichael was impaired. Id. The plurality
 
observed:
 
By failing to address these attendant circumstances,
the defense failed to meet its burden of providing
evidence to support a finding that the conduct alleged
“did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil
sought to be prevented by [HRS § 712-1243] or did so
only to an extent too trivial to warrant the
condemnation of conviction.”
 
Id. (quoting HRS § 702-236) (brackets in original).
 
Here, Rapozo addressed her alleged conduct and the
 
attendant circumstances solely through her attorney’s declaration
 
in support of her motion to dismiss. Although the declaration
 asserted that “Rapozo’s explanation for having the bullet in her
 possession was that she was going to have it made into a charm
 for a bracelet,” Rapozo offered no further evidence or testimony
 to corroborate that asserted explanation. She did not explain
 why, if her purpose in possessing the bullet was to make it into
 a charm for a bracelet, she was carrying it with her while
 driving at 1:14 a.m. in Waikiki. Nor did she explain why, if her
 purpose was benign, she concealed the bullet in an intimate part
 of her clothing. Nor did she explain where and when she obtained
 the bullet, and where she was traveling from and going to when
 she was stopped by police.
12
 
12
 The dissenting opinion asserts that the circuit court “considered
all of the relevant and material circumstances attendant to [Rapozo’s]
possession” because the court considered the facts as set forth in Rapozo’s
declaration of counsel. Dissenting opinion at 31 (emphasis added). With all
 due respect, however, the dissent’s view would appear to allow a defendant to
limit which circumstances are considered “material.” However, as we discuss
further infra, the trial court should consider “all of the relevant facts
bearing on the defendant's conduct and the nature of the attendant
circumstances regarding the commission of the offense” before dismissing a
(continued...)
 
-37­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Notably, the circuit court, in its findings of fact,
 
did not determine whether Rapozo’s asserted explanation was
 
credible. FOF 6 merely reiterates that “Ms. Rapozo’s explanation
 for possessing the bullet was that she was going to have it made
 into a charm for a bracelet.” In other words, although the
 circuit court accurately repeated the explanation as set forth in
 the declaration of Rapozo’s counsel, it did not find that it was
 in fact true. We therefore respectfully disagree with the
 dissent’s assertion that “[Rapozo’s] explanation . . . is binding
 on this court.”
13 Dissenting opinion at 12. 
It is not surprising that the circuit court failed to
 
make a finding on the credibility of the explanation, since there
 
12(...continued)
charge as de minimis, see Viernes, 92 Hawai' i at 133, 988 P.2d at 198
(emphasis added) (citation omitted), and we have found abuse of discretion
when in our judgment the trial court failed to do so, see Park, 55 Haw. at617-18, 525 P.2d at 591-92. We have also affirmed when the trial court denied motions to dismiss and the defendant failed to address attendant circumstances that we considered to be relevant. See Carmichael, 99 Hawai' i at 80, 53 P.3d
at 219 (plurality opinion of Moon, C.J.; and Nakayama, J.) (affirming denialof motion to dismiss the charge of promoting a dangerous drug in the thirddegree as de minimis where the defendant addressed the quantity of drugpossessed, but did not address his possession of drug paraphernalia, hisdriving at excessive speed, or the arresting officer’s determination that thedefendant was intoxicated); Fukagawa, 100 Hawai' i at 506-07, 60 P.3d at 907-08
(affirming denial of motion to dismiss the charge of promoting a dangerousdrug in the third degree as de minimis because the amount possessed wassufficient to be “‘used’ by someone” and, alternatively, because the defendant“presented neither testimony nor other evidence regarding the circumstancesattendant to [his] possession of drug paraphernalia and the substancecontaining methamphetamine”). 
13
 We further disagree with the dissent’s assertion that “it can be
inferred from both the inclusion of [Rapozo’s] explanation in its findings and
in ultimately granting [Rapozo’s] de minimis motion , that the [circuit] court
made an assessment as to [Rapozo’s] explanation.” Dissenting opinion at 38.
To the contrary, the wording of FOF 6 suggests that the circuit court reserved
decision on the credibility of Rapozo’s proffered explanation. For the same
 reason, we disagree with the implication that we have second-guessed the
circuit court’s determination with regard to credibility. Dissenting opinion
at 38-39. 
-38­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was insufficient information in the record to enable it to do so. 
As noted above, Rapozo had the burden in the circuit court of
 establishing the relevant attendant circumstances, but failed to
 place any information in the record that would have enabled the
 court to determine that her explanation was credible in light of
 the surrounding circumstances, and that her conduct was in fact
 “trivial” given the purposes of the statute. She chose not to
 present her own testimony or that of any other “live” witness
 that would have allowed the explanation to be further developed,
 and also limited the attendant circumstances that were presented
 to the court to the immediate circumstances of her arrest. While
 we agree that the de minimis statute does not specify any
 particular method of proof by the defendant, dissenting opinion
 at 29-30, nevertheless it does require the defendant to present
 all of the relevant attendant circumstances to the court, and
 Rapozo failed to do so here. See State v. Park, 55 Haw. at 616,
 
525 P.2d at 591
 (“We think that before [HRS § 702-236] can be
 
properly applied in a criminal case, all of the relevant facts
 bearing upon the defendant’s conduct and the nature of the
 attendant circumstances regarding the commission of the offense
 should be shown to the judge.”). 
The dissent further asserts that Rapozo’s explanation
 
“cannot be viably or fairly challenged on appeal or relied on by
 the majority” because the State “did not challenge the
 credibility of [Rapozo’s] explanation in its memorandum in
 
-39­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
opposition to [Rapozo’s] motion to dismiss or at the hearing on
 
the motion.” Dissenting opinion at 34. However, the State’s
 opposition to Rapozo’s motion clearly disputed Rapozo’s
 characterization of the relevant events, by arguing that
 “[Rapozo’s] possession of ammunition that is capable of being
 fired, considered with all of the other attendant circumstances,
 shows that [Rapozo’s] conduct was causing or threatening the harm
 or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.” 
(Emphasis added). Moreover, in its Opening Brief to the ICA, the
 State challenged the circuit court’s COL 6, which concluded that
 Rapozo had met her burden of showing that the de minimis statute
 applied. In support of this point of error, the State argued,
 inter alia, that there was no “determination of credibility with
 regard to [Rapozo’s] explanation[.]”
14 While the dissent cites
 
to Wisdom v. Pflueger, 4 Haw. App. 455, 459, 667 P.2d 844, 848
 (1983) for the proposition that “an argument supporting a
 challenge to a conclusion on appeal does not amount to a
 challenge to a finding,” dissenting opinion at 37, the ICA in
 Pflueger explained that “[i]f a finding is not properly attacked,
 . . . any conclusion which follows from it and is a correct
 statement of the law is valid.” 4 Haw. App. at 459, 667 P.2d at
 848. Here, FOF 6 merely repeats Rapozo’s explanation, and thus
 
COL 6 does not “follow[] from” FOF 6. Accordingly, the
 
14
 We note that Rapozo has not, in her Answering Brief to the ICA or
in her Application to this court, objected to the State’s challenge to the
credibility of her explanation on the ground that the argument was waived. 
-40­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
credibility of Rapozo’s explanation and the failure of the
 
circuit court to enter a finding on that issue are properly
 before this court.
 
In order to properly exercise its discretion under HRS 
§ 702-236, the trial court must consider all of the relevant surrounding circumstances. See Park, 55 Haw. at 617-18, 525 P.2d 
at 592. Where, as here, the defendant’s explanation for his or her conduct is central to that inquiry, it is not sufficient to simply repeat the defendant’s explanation without making a finding as to its credibility in light of all the circumstances. See State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai
'i 279, 283, 1 P.3d 281, 285 (2000) 
(noting that “[b]efore a trial court can address whether an offense constitutes a de minimis infraction, the court must make factual determinations regarding the circumstances of the offense”) (citation omitted). 
We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s suggestion 
that our decision here is inconsistent with State v. Hinton, 120 Hawai
'i 265, 273, 204 P.3d 484, 492 (2009), dissenting opinion at 
44-51, where, in reviewing a trial court’s decision to dismiss an indictment after defendant’s first trial resulted in a mistrial, we observed that “[t]he burden of establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it.” Assuming arguendo that a “strong showing” is required in the instant context as well, this court has held that a failure by a trial court to consider all of the relevant 
-41­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
attendant circumstances suffices to make the necessary showing. 
See Park, 55 Haw. at 617-18, 525 P.2d at 591-92; cf. Fukagawa, 100 Hawai
'i at 507, 60 P.3d at 908. The failure to consider 
those circumstances, the consideration of which is required by HRS § 702-236, means that the circuit court has “disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.” Oughterson, 99 Hawai
'i at 253, 
54 P.3d at 424 (citation omitted). Where the issue is whether a trial court applied incorrect legal principles in exercising its discretion, we freely review the court’s decision to determine whether the law was correctly applied. Estate of James Campbell, 
106 Hawai
'i 453, 461, 106 P.3d 1096, 1104 (2005) (“although the 
trial court's discretion under Rule 24(b)(2) is very broad, we may overturn the probate court’s denial of intervention under HRCP Rule 24(b)(2) if we conclude that it has disregarded legal principles to the substantial detriment of Appellants”) (internal quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted); Life of the Land v. Land Use Comm’n, 63 Haw. 166, 180, 623 P.2d 431, 443 (1981) (“where the record discloses a possible misapprehension or misapplication of Rule 23’s criteria, it is incumbent upon us to conduct a careful review of the rule’s application to the facts involved”). 
Moreover, even if Rapozo’s explanation is accepted at
 
face value, it does not, on the current record, suffice to
 establish that her conduct was de minimis. Although the
 
-42­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
declaration of Rapozo’s counsel states that Rapozo intended to 
make the bullet into a charm for a bracelet, it does not state that Rapozo intended to render the bullet inoperable in doing so. Thus, under her proffered explanation, Rapozo could have carried a live bullet with her indefinitely. This contrasts sharply with a situation in which a defendant possesses a prohibited item for a short period of time and for a reason that is not inconsistent with the purpose of the statute in question. See Carmichael, 99 
Hawai
'i at 80 n.8, 53 P.3d at 219 n.8 (noting that “in a case 
where the evidence demonstrates that a defendant had knowingly recovered a quantity of methamphetamine with the intent to deliver it to police as evidence of a crime when he was arrested and charged for possessing ‘any amount’ of a dangerous drug, dismissal as a de minimis offense would clearly be warranted”); see also Park, 55 Haw. at 617-18, 515 P.2d at 592 (“we think it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss the charges as de minimis infractions, without any indicators to show that each of these offenses was in fact an innocent, technical infraction”). 
We cannot say that the open-ended possession by Rapozo
 
of a live round of ammunition threatens the harm that the statute
 was designed to prevent only to a trivial extent. Thus, Rapozo
 failed to carry her burden of proof on the motion to dismiss.
 
It is instructive to compare the circumstances of this

 
case to those surrounding the defendant’s conduct in State v.
 Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 828 P.2d 269 (1992). In Akina, the defendant
 
-43­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was charged with custodial interference after assisting Sue, a
 
ward of the State who had run away from her foster parents. Id.
 
at 76, 828 P.2d at 270. Sue had approached Akina at a beach
 park, and told him that she was nineteen years old and pregnant. 
Id. Akina invited her to come to the home that he shared with
 
his mother, and Sue stayed with them for two weeks, during which
 time Akina informed Sue’s foster parents of her whereabouts and
 requested that Sue return to them. Id. Sue eventually did
 
return home but ran away again to Akina. Id. at 76-77, 828 P.2d
 
at 270-71. When Akina again attempted to return her to her
 foster parents, the foster parents told him that it was a
 criminal offense to help runaways. Id. at 77, 828 P.2d at 271. 
When Sue refused to return, he agreed to let her stay at his home
 until the following week. Id. Sue’s foster parents then called
 
the police, and Akina was charged with custodial interference in
 violation of HRS § 707-727(1)(a) (1985).
15 Id. 
The case went to trial, where
 
[D]efendant testified that he was just trying to help
Sue. [Sue’s foster father] agreed, testifying that he
felt defendant was a nice person who was sincerely
trying to help. Even the prosecuting attorney
conceded that defendant’s pattern of behavior showed
that he wanted to help Sue. The court concluded that
 “[d]efendant’s main sin was being–or allowing himself
to be taken advantage of.”
 
15
 HRS § 707-727 (1985) provided in relevant part:
 
(1)	 A person commits the offense of custodial
interference in the second degree if:
 
(a)	 He knowingly takes or entices a person
less than eighteen years old from his
lawful custodian, knowing that he has no
right to do so.
 
-44­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Id. (some brackets in the original and some added).
 
However, the circuit court denied Akina’s motion to
 
dismiss the charge as de minimis, reasoning that Akina’s actions
 
fell within the plain meaning of the statute and that convicting
 Akina would comply with legislative intent. Id. This court
 
agreed that Akina’s conduct fell within the plain meaning of the
 statute, but nevertheless held that the circuit court abused its
 discretion in denying Akina’s motion to dismiss because Akina’s
 conduct was “too trivial to warrant the condemnation of
 conviction.” Id. at 79, 828 P.2d at 272 (citing HRS § 702­
236(1)(b)). We noted that under the circumstances, “there was
 little [Akina] could do to worsen Sue’s relationship with her
 custodial parents.” Id. Moreover, “[Akina’s] actions did not
 
cause the rift between Sue and her parents, and it is unlikely
 that his actions altered the existing custodial relationship at
 all.” Id.
 
In sum, the record in Akina amply established that the
 
defendant’s interference did not “warrant the condemnation of
 conviction” when his conduct and the attendant circumstances were
 examined in light of the purposes of the statute. In contrast,
 the explanation proffered in the declaration of Rapozo’s attorney
 did not adequately address the nature of her conduct and the
 circumstances attendant to the offense, and thus did not
 
-45­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
establish that Rapozo’s conduct was trivial.16 See Park, 55 Haw. 
at 617-18, 525 P.2d at 592; Fukagawa, 100 Hawai 'i at 504, 60 P.3d 
at 905. Therefore, Rapozo did not carry her burden of 
establishing that the de minimis provision applies. See id. 
Finally, we note that both this court and the ICA have
 
considered the seriousness of the alleged conduct in determining
 whether a trial court abused its discretion in ruling on a motion
 to dismiss a charge as de minimis. See, e.g., Park, 55 Haw. at
 
617, 525 P.2d at 592 (noting that the court should consider “the
 resulting harm or evil, if any, caused or threatened by these
 infractions; the probable impact of these violations upon the
 community; the seriousness of the infractions in terms of the
 punishment . . .”). For example, in State v. Schofill, 63 Haw.
 77, 621 P.2d 364 (1980), the trial court dismissed a charge of
 promoting a dangerous drug in the first degree, where the
 defendant allegedly agreed to sell an undercover police officer a
 quarter ounce of cocaine for $550. Id. at 79, 83, 621 P.2d at
 
376, 370. This court reversed, noting that the charge of
 “[p]romoting a dangerous drug in the first degree . . . is a
 Class A felony, punishable by imprisonment for a period of 20
 years” and observing that “[t]raffic in narcotics can hardly be
 said to be a de minimis offense.” Id. at 83, 621 P.2d at 370.
 
16
 We note that Akina was decided with the benefit of a full trial
 
record. 73 Haw. at 77, 828 P.2d at 271. Nothing in this opinion should be
construed to prevent Rapozo from pursuing a motion to dismiss pursuant to HRS
§ 702-236 at a later time in the event a more fully developed record supports
dismissal. 
-46­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Similarly, in State v. Johnson, 3 Haw. App. 472, 475,
 
653 P.2d 428, 431 (1982), the ICA considered whether a
 
prosecution for negligent homicide, where the defendant’s car
 crossed over the centerline of Hana Highway and struck an
 oncoming car, killing a passenger therein, was de minimis. The
 ICA affirmed the order of the circuit court denying Johnson’s
 motion to dismiss, concluding that, “[u]nder the circumstances of
 a case where a death results from one’s negligence, we deem it an
 assault on good sense to argue that the violator’s actions were
 de minimis.” Id. at 484, 653 P.2d at 436-37.
 
In the instant case, the possession of ammunition in
 
violation of HRS § 134-7(b) is a class B felony, involving
 conduct that has the potential for serious public safety
 consequences. While not dispositive, these factors weigh against
 granting the motion. 
IV. Conclusion
 
The June 5, 2009 judgment of the Intermediate Court of
 
Appeals is affirmed, and this matter is remanded to the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit for proceedings consistent with this
 opinion.
