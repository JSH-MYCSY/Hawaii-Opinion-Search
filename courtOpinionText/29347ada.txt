IN PLACE OF MOON, C.J., RECUSED, AND ACOBA, J.,
DISSENTING, WITH WHOM DUFFY, J., JOINS 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
Wanda Ruriko Mita was charged with Animal Nuisance in
 
violation of Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) § 7-2.3 (1990 &
 
Supp. No. 6, 2-05), which provides that “[i]t is unlawful to be
 
the owner of an animal, farm animal, or poultry engaged in animal
 
nuisance as defined in section 7-2.2[.]” 
Mita was originally
 
issued a citation that indicated that she committed this offense
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
by owning, harboring, or keeping two dogs that were barking. 
Prior to the start of trial, the State also orally charged Mita
 
by using language that tracked the provisions of ROH § 7-2.3. 
Mita objected that the charge was insufficient because it did not
 
give Mita notice of what type of “animal nuisance” she was being
 
charged with, as that term is defined in ROH § 7-2.2.1 The
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district
 
2
court)  concluded that the charge was sufficient, and convicted
Mita after a bench trial.
 
Mita appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA). In its February 23, 2010 Summary Disposition Order (SDO), 
the ICA cited State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 
(2009), in concluding that the charge against Mita was insufficient because the definition of the term “animal nuisance” 
in ROH § 7-2.2 contains an essential element of the offense of 
animal nuisance, and the offense cannot be understood by a person 
of common understanding without including that definition. The 
ICA accordingly vacated the judgment of the district court, and 
remanded with instructions to dismiss without prejudice. 
The State of Hawai
'i (State) raises the following 
question in its application for a writ of certiorari: “Whether 
the ICA gravely erred as a matter of law and fact in holding that 
the oral charge of Animal Nuisance was insufficient.” 
For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the
 
citation and oral charge, when considered together, gave Mita
 
fair notice of the offense. In contrast to the circumstances in
 
Wheeler, the definition of “animal nuisance” in ROH § 7-2.2 does
 
not create an additional essential element of the offense, and,
 
1
 As discussed further infra, ROH § 7-2.2 (1990 & Supp. No. 6, 2-05)
 
defines animal nuisance as including several different types of animal
behavior.

 The Honorable Faye M. Koyanagi presided.

in any event, is consistent with its commonly understood meaning. 
Thus, the charge against Mita was sufficient. Accordingly, we
 
reverse the ICA’s judgment, and remand this case to the ICA to
 
address the remaining issues raised by Mita, which the ICA did
 
not resolve.
 
I. Background
 
A. Background Facts
 
1. Citation and Oral Charge
 
On June 5, 2008, Mita was issued an “Animal License & 
Regulation – Complaint & Summons” (citation). The citation,
 
signed “Wanda Mita[,]” stated that Mita “[d]id on/or about this 3
 
day of June Yr 08 at about 1940-2050 did own, harbour or keep
 
(animal description): Boxers Name Roxy/Obie Color Brown . . . at
 
(location): [Mita’s residence address] and did commit the offense
 
of: . . . animal nuisance-Sec.: 7-2.3 Barking Dog[.]” 
Additionally, the citation had a section entitled “Officer’s
 
Report” which stated that “Mita was issued a Barking 3rd
 
citation. She was already issued a previous Barking 2 warning
 
citation.” The citation also advised Mita of her appearance date
 
in court.
 
Mita appeared in court on July 17, 2008, represented by
 
counsel, and waived reading of the charge and entered a plea of
 
not guilty.
 
At the start of trial on August 14, 2008, prior to any
 
witnesses being called, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA)
 
read the following charge to Mita: “On or about June 3rd, 2008,
 
in the city and county of Honolulu, state of Hawaii, you as the
 
owner of an animal, farm animal, or poultry engaged in animal
 
nuisance as defined in section 7-2.2, thereby violating section
 
7-2.3 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu.”
 
ROH § 7-2.3 provides as follows:
 
[] Animal nuisance –- Prohibited. It is unlawful to be
 
-3­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the owner of an animal, farm animal or poultry engaged
in animal nuisance as defined in Section 7-2.2;
provided, however, that it shall not be deemed to be
animal nuisance for purposes of this article if, at
the time the animal, farm animal or poultry is making
any noise, biting or stinging, a person is trespassing
or threatening trespass upon private property in or
upon which the animal, farm animal or poultry is
situated, or for any other legitimate cause which
teased or provoked said animal, farm animal or
poultry.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
ROH § 7-2.2 defines “animal nuisance” as follows:
 
. . . .
 
“Animal nuisance,” for the purposes of this
section, shall include but not be limited to any
animal, farm animal or poultry which: 
(a) Makes noise continuously and/or incessantly for a
period of 10 minutes or intermittently for one-half
hour or more to the disturbance of any person at any
time of day or night and regardless of whether the
animal, farm animal or poultry is physically situated
in or upon private property; 
(b) Barks, whines, howls, crows, cries or makes any
other unreasonable noise as described in Section
 
7-2.4(c) [ 3
] of this article; or 
(c)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of [Hawai' i Revised 
Statutes (HRS)] Section 142-75 [governing the dutiesand liabilities of an owner of a dog that has bittenanother person] or any other applicable law, bites orstings a person. 
Mita objected to the oral charge:
 
[] Your Honor, if I may make for the record an
objection to the arraignment. I do not believe that
arraignment is specific enough to put the defendant
 
3 ROH § 7-2.4(c) (1990 & Supp. No. 6, 2-05) provides:
 
Noise is unreasonable within the meaning of this
article if considering the nature and the
circumstances surrounding the animal nuisance,
including the nature of the location and the time of
the day or night, it interferes with reasonable
individual or group activities such as, but not
limited to, communication, work, rest, recreation or
sleep; or the failure to heed the admonition of a
police officer or a special officer of the animal
control contractor that the noise is unreasonable and
 should be stopped or reduced.
 
-4­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
specifically on notice what part of the - if I may
call “barking dog” ordinance she's being charged with.
There’s [sic] basically four violations or four acts
which may constitute a violation of the ordinance. One
is whether or not the dog made noise continuously
and/or incessantly for a period of ten minutes; that’s
ordinance section 7-2.2(a); or made noise
intermittently for one half-hour or more to the
disturbance of any person at any time of day or night;
that’s ordinance section 7-2.2(a); or bark, whine,
howl, cry, or make other unreasonable noise which
interfered with reasonable individual or group
activity such as but not limited to communication,
work, rest, recreation, or sleep; that’s ordinance
section 7-2.2[(b)] and incorporating 7-2.4(c); or
failed to heed the admonition of a police officer or a
special officer of the animal control contractor that
the noise was unreasonable and should be stopped;
that’s ordinance section[s] 7-2.2[(b)] and 7-2.4(c).
And it’s our position that under State v. Jendrusch,
58 Haw. 279, [567 P.2d 1242 (1977),] a 1977 case, we
should receive specificity in the arraignment so that
we know exactly which of these sections of the
ordinance we must defend against.
 
The DPA argued that the oral charge was sufficient
 
because:
 
[Mita] is charged under section 7-2.3. 7-2.2 is a
definition section, in which it defines animal
nuisance, and section 7-2.3 incorporates a general
animal nuisance as defined in section 7-2.2; and the
State’s position would be that the wording of the
statute is broad enough to encompass all subsections
(a), (b), and (c) listed under animal nuisance.
 
The DPA offered, however, to read the definition of
 
animal nuisance, but the district court found that a reading was
 
unnecessary and that the arraignment was proper. Mita pled not
 
guilty.
 
2. Evidence at Trial
 
At trial, the State called two witnesses, both of whom
 
were neighbors of Mita.   Both witnesses testified that they heard
 
Mita’s dogs barking on the evening of June 3, 2008.  The first
 witness testified that she made a written record of Mita’s dogs
 
barking on June 3, 2008 from 7:45 p.m. to 8:50 p.m.   She
 
testified that she knew it was Mita’s dogs barking by their
 
distinctive bark.   The second witness testified that she made a
 
-5­4
 The district court concluded that the State proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mita’s dogs were barking, based on the testimony of the
State’s witnesses.  The district court additionally concluded that the State’s
witnesses “had a greater opportunity to make these observations and hearing
the dogs” than did the defense witness, due to the positioning of the
respective properties.
   
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
written record of Mita’s dogs barking on June 3, 2008 from
 
approximately 7:30 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. She testified that she
 
specifically saw Mita’s dogs barking that evening, and could
 
distinguish their bark from that of other dogs in the area. 
Following the State’s evidence, Mita moved for a
 
judgment of acquittal on six grounds outlined in her Trial
 
Memorandum and Memorandum in Support of Motion for Judgment of
 
Acquittal filed on August 14, 2008, as well as her Supplemental
 
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal filed
 
on August 22, 2008. Relevant to the instant appeal, Mita argued
 
that the charge was insufficient because it only charged Mita
 
with violating ROH § 7-2.3, prohibiting animal nuisance, and did
 
not apprise Mita what specific act contained within the
 
definition of “animal nuisance” in ROH § 7-2.2 she was being
 
charged with. The district court denied the motion, and ruled,
 
inter alia, that the charge was sufficient. 
The defense called one witness, who was also a neighbor
 
of Mita. The defense witness testified that she “did not notice
 
any dogs barking” the evening of June 3, 2008, and that if Mita’s
 
dogs had been barking, she was “almost certain” that she would
 
have noticed it. 
3. Renewed motion for judgment of acquittal
 
After the defense rested, Mita renewed her motion for
 
judgment of acquittal. The district court denied the motion and
 
found Mita guilty of violating ROH § 7-2.3.4 The district court
 
entered its judgment on August 28, 2008, convicting Mita of
 violating ROH § 7-2.3 and sentencing Mita to pay a $50 fine. 
-6­ 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Mita filed her notice of appeal on September 5, 2008.
 
B. ICA Appeal
 
On appeal to the ICA, Mita raised several points of
 
error. She argued that the State failed to prove the following
 
beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Mita owned the dogs which
 
were allegedly barking; (2) Mita’s reckless state of mind; (3)
 
that the dogs were barking in violation of ROH § 7-2.3; and (4)
 
that a qualified animal control officer had issued Mita the
 
citation. Additionally, Mita argued that the charge was
 
insufficient and that ROH § 7-2.3 is unconstitutionally vague.
 
Citing to Wheeler, a majority of the ICA held in a SDO
 
that the charge was insufficient, and therefore vacated Mita’s
 
conviction and sentence and remanded the case to the district
 
court with instructions to dismiss without prejudice. 
Specifically, the ICA concluded that: 
The offense of Animal Nuisance is not understood by a
person of common understanding because the ordinance
refers to “an animal, farm animal or poultry engaged
in animal nuisance as defined in Section 7-2.2.” The
 term “animal nuisance” is specifically limited to
three types of actions which the animal, farm animal,
or poultry must commit in order to be considered a
violation of ROH § 7-2.3. A violation of ROH § 7-2.3
simply cites another ROH section which contains an
essential element that the State must prove to find
Mita guilty. This did not provide fair notice to Mita.
 
The ICA did not address Mita’s remaining points of
 
error.
 
Chief Judge Nakamura dissented, concluding that the oral
 
charge against Mita was sufficient. He distinguished the charge
 
against Mita from that in Wheeler, where the defendant was charged
 
with operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant
 
(OVUII).5 First, Chief Judge Nakamura reasoned that, unlike the
 
5
 As discussed infra, the charge in Wheeler tracked the language of
 
the relevant statute, HRS § 291E-61 (2007), and alleged that the defendant
“did operate or assume actual physical control of a . . . vehicle[,]” but did
(continued...)
 
-7­ 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
term “operate” as used in the charge in Wheeler, “[t]he statutory
 
definition of ‘animal nuisance’ does not depart from the commonly
 
understood meaning of the term.”  Second, he concluded that unlike
 
Wheeler, where “the statutory definition of the term ‘operate’
 
create[d] an additional essential element” and therefore needed to
 
be alleged, “the statutory definition of ‘animal nuisance’ does
 
not purport to create an additional essential element for the
 
offense.”
 
Additionally, Chief Judge Nakamura noted that the oral 
charge “specifically directed Mita to the statutory definition of 
the term ‘animal nuisance’” in ROH § 7-2.2, which “served to 
further inform and apprise Mita of the nature of the charge 
against her.” He recognized that “[a]lthough including a citation 
to the offense statute in a charge does not cure a charge that 
omits an essential element of the offense, it can be argued that a 
specific reference to the statutory definition, which tells the 
defendant where to look for additional information, may be 
considered where the charge already encompasses the essential 
elements of the offense.” Finally, he concluded that pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 7(a) (2008), cited 
infra, the charge in the instant case consisted of both the oral charge and the citation, and when considered together, they 
sufficiently alleged the essential elements of the offense of 
animal nuisance. 
On March 16, 2010, the ICA filed its Judgment on Appeal.
 
The State timely filed its application on June 10, 2010. Mita did
 
not file a response.
 
5(...continued)
not further include the definition of the term “operate” set forth in HRS
§ 291E-1 (2007): “to drive or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upona public way, street, road, or highway . . . .” 121 Hawai' i at 386-87, 391,
219 P.3d at 1173-74, 1178 (emphasis in original).

II. Standard of Review
 
“‘Whether [a charge] sets forth all the essential
 
elements of [a charged] offense . . . is a question of law[,]’
 
which we review under the de novo, or ‘right/wrong,’ standard.’”
 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177 (citation omitted). 
III. Discussion
 
The State argues that the ICA erred for two reasons. 
First, the State argues that the ICA erred because the citation
 
and oral charge should be considered together under HRPP Rule
 
6
7(a),  and when doing so, the charge sufficiently alleges all the
6 HRPP Rule 7(a) provides:
 
(a) Use of indictment, information, or complaint. The
 
charge against a defendant is an indictment, an
information, or a complaint filed in court, provided
that, in any case where a defendant is accused of an
offense that is subject to a maximum sentence of less
than six months in prison (other than Operating a
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant) and is
issued a citation in lieu of physical arrest pursuant
to Section 803-6(b) of the [HRS] and summoned to
appear in court, the citation and an oral recitation
of the essential facts constituting the offense
charged as set forth in Rule 5(b)(1), shall be deemed
the complaint, notwithstanding any waiver of the
recitation.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
HRPP Rule 5(b)(1) provides, in relevant part:
 
Arraignment. In the district court, if the offense
charged against the defendant is other than a felony,
the complaint shall be filed and proceedings shall be
had in accordance with this section (b). . . . If a
defendant is issued a citation in lieu of physical
arrest pursuant to Section 803-6(b) of the [HRS] and
summoned to be orally charged as authorized by Rule
7(a) of these rules, a copy of the citation shall be
filed and proceedings shall be had in accordance with
this section (b). . . . When the offense is charged by
a citation and the defendant is summoned to be orally
charged, arraignment shall be in open court or by
video conference when permitted by Rule 43. The
arraignment shall consist of a recitation of the
essential facts constituting the offense charged to
the defendant and calling upon the defendant to plead
 
(continued...)
 
-9­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
essential elements of the offense of animal nuisance. Second, the
 
State argues that “the ICA’s reliance upon Wheeler in holding the
 
oral charge insufficient was misplaced” because “the charge here,
 
unlike the charge in Wheeler, (1) on its face is ‘readily
 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding[,]’ and, (2)
 
cited the essential elements of the offense and incorporated a
 
statutory reference to the offense’s definitional section.” 
For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the
 
charge against Mita was sufficient.
 
A.	 The Oral Charge Was Sufficient Because it Gave Notice to Mita
of the Nature and Cause of the Accusation
 
Article I, section 14 of the Hawai 'i Constitution 
provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall 
enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of 
the accusation[.]” “The criminal process begins when the accused 
is charged with a criminal offense, if it is not a felony, by 
complaint or oral charge.” State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai 'i 312, 
317, 55 P.3d 276, 281 (2002) (citing HRPP Rule 5(b)(1)). “[T]he sufficiency of the charging instrument is measured, inter alia, by 
‘whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be 
charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he [or 
she] must be prepared to meet[.]’” Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 391, 
219 P.3d at 1178 (quoting State v. Wells, 78 Hawai 'i 373, 379-80, 
894 P.2d 70, 76-77 (1995)) (some brackets in original, some 
added). “In other words, the oral charge must be worded in a 
manner such ‘that the nature and cause of the accusation [could] 
6(...continued)
thereto.
 
(Some emphasis added).
 
The maximum sentence for a violation of the offense of animal
 
nuisance is thirty days imprisonment. ROH § 7-2.10(b) (1990 & Supp. No. 6,
2-05). 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
be understood by a person of common understanding[.]’” Sprattling, 
99 Hawai 'i at 318, 55 P.3d at 282 (quoting State v. Israel, 78 
Hawai'i 66, 70, 890 P.2d 303, 307 (1995)) (brackets in original). 
The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether or not the charge 
provided the accused with fair notice of the essential elements. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 395, 219 P.3d at 1182. This court has 
recognized that “‘[a] charge defective in this regard amounts to a failure to state an offense, and a conviction based upon it cannot 
be sustained, for that would constitute a denial of due process.’” 
Id. at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 (quoting State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 
279, 281, 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977)). 
As noted above, the ICA concluded that, pursuant to this 
court’s holding in Wheeler, the charge in the instant case was 
insufficient. However, Wheeler is distinguishable. In Wheeler, 
the defendant was orally charged with operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII). 121 Hawai
'i at 386-87, 
219 P.3d at 1173-74. The charge tracked the language of the relevant statute, HRS § 291E-61, and alleged that the defendant 
“did operate or assume actual physical control of a motor vehicle 
while under the influence of alcohol . . . .” Id. However, the 
charge did not further include the definition of the term “operate,” which was defined in HRS § 291E-1 as “to drive or 
assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road, or highway . . . .” Id. at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 
(emphasis in original). This court held that HRS § 291E-1 establishes an attendant circumstance of the proscribed conduct, 
i.e., that the offense of OVUII occur on a public way, street, 
road, or highway. Id. at 392-93, 219 P.3d at 1179-80. Therefore, 
since the location of the proscribed conduct established by HRS § 291E-1 was an attendant circumstance, this court held that it 
was an essential element of the offense of OVUII that should have 
been included within the charge against the defendant. Id. 
-11­ 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(citing HRS § 702-205 (1993)).7
 
This court emphasized that although the charge tracked
 
the language of the statute, the term “operate” as used in HRS
 
§ 291E-61 “is neither ‘unmistakable’ nor ‘readily comprehensible
 
to persons of common understanding’” and therefore did not provide
 
the defendant with fair notice of that aspect of the charge. Id.
 
at 394-95, 219 P.3d at 1181-82 (citation omitted). Specifically,
 this court concluded that the common understanding of the term
 
“operate” “does not geographically limit where the conduct must
 
take place.” Id. at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181. Therefore, merely
 
including the term “operate” in the charge, without providing the
 defendant with notice that his conduct must have occurred “upon a
 
public way, street, road, or highway,” was insufficient. Id. 
Additionally, this court recognized that “none of the other
 information in the charge provided [the defendant] with fair
 
notice of that element” where, for example, the charge “did not
 
contain any specification of where the alleged offense occurred,
 
other than it took place in the City and County of Honolulu.” Id.
 
at 395, 219 P.3d at 1182.
 
There are two significant factors present in the instant
 
case that were not present in Wheeler, thus making it readily
 distinguishable: (1) the definition of “animal nuisance” in ROH
 
§ 7-2.2 does not create an additional essential element of the
 
offense; and (2) in any event, the definition of “animal nuisance”
 
is consistent with its commonly understood meaning and therefore
 
Mita had fair notice of the offense charged. Thus, the oral
 
charge against Mita, which tracked the language of ROH § 7-2.3,
 
sufficiently alleged all of the essential elements of the offense
 
7
 HRS § 702-205 provides: “The elements of an offense are such (1)
conduct, (2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as: (a) Are
specified by the definition of the offense, and (b) Negative a defense (other
than a defense based on the statute of limitations, lack of venue, or lack of
jurisdiction).” 
-12­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of animal nuisance. 
Under the Hawai 'i Penal Code, the essential elements of 
an offense are (1) conduct; (2) attendant circumstances; and (3) 
results of conduct. Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 
(citing HRS § 702-205 (1993)). In Wheeler, because the definition of the term “operate” created an attendant circumstance, which is 
an essential element of the charge pursuant to HRS § 702-205, this 
court concluded that the oral charge must provide fair notice of 
that element. Id. at 392-93, 219 P.3d at 1179-80. Here, Mita was 
charged with violating ROH § 7-2.3, which provides, in relevant 
part, that “[i]t is unlawful to be the owner of an animal, farm 
animal or poultry engaged in animal nuisance as defined in Section 
7-2.2.” Therefore, in order for a person to be found guilty of 
violating ROH § 7-2.3 the State must prove (1) that person is the 
owner of an animal, farm animal or poultry which (2) engaged in 
animal nuisance. 
The oral charge against Mita directly tracked ROH § 7­
2.3 and read as follows: “On or about June 3rd, 2008, in the city
 
and county of Honolulu, state of Hawaii, you as the owner of an
 
animal, farm animal, or poultry engaged in animal nuisance as
 
defined in section 7-2.2, thereby violating section 7-2.3 of the
 
Revised Ordinances of Honolulu.” The charge did not further
 
allege the definition of “animal nuisance” as found in ROH § 7­
2.2. However, this did not render the oral charge insufficient
 
because the definition does not create additional essential
 elements of the offense of animal nuisance.
8
 
The ICA concluded that “[t]he term ‘animal nuisance’ is
 
8
 We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s contention that State
 
v. Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. 353, 873 P.2d 110 (1994), overruled on other grounds
by State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai' i 172, 907 P.2d 758 (1995), stands for the
proposition that ROH § 7-2.2 contains additional essential elements of theoffense of animal nuisance. Nobriga did not address whether ROH § 7-2.2 sets
forth additional essential elements, and clearly stated that the “offense” ofanimal nuisance “is set forth in [ROH] § 7-2.3 (1990)[.]” Id. at 355, 873 
P.2d at 112 (emphasis added).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
specifically limited to three types of actions which the animal,
 
farm animal, or poultry must commit in order to be considered a
 
violation of ROH § 7-2.3.”  However, the definition of “animal
 
nuisance” in ROH § 7-2.2 does not create elements in addition to
 
those already required by ROH § 7-2.3, but instead provides an
 
inclusive, rather than exclusive, list of examples of what the
 
term may include:
 
“Animal nuisance,” for the purposes of this
section, shall include but not be limited to any
animal, farm animal or poultry which:
 
(a) Makes noise continuously and/or incessantly for a
period of 10 minutes or intermittently for one-half
hour or more to the disturbance of any person at any
time of day or night and regardless of whether the
animal, farm animal or poultry is physically situated
in or upon private property; 
(b) Barks, whines, howls, crows, cries or makes any
other unreasonable noise as described in Section
 7-2.4(c) of this article[, quoted supra note 3]; or
 
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of HRS Section
142-75 or any other applicable law, bites or stings a
 person.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
Thus, the charge against Mita is distinguishable from
 
Wheeler because unlike the term “operate,” the definition of the
 
term “animal nuisance” does not create any additional attendant
 
circumstances or other essential elements of the offense of animal
 
nuisance. Wheeler does not require that the State provide
 
statutory definitions in every charge which tracks the language of
 a statute that includes terms defined elsewhere in the code. 
Requiring the State to do so would render charges unduly complex,
 
in contravention of the policy reflected in HRPP Rule 7(d) that
 
“[t]he charge shall be a plain, concise and definite statement of
 
the essential facts constituting the offense charged.” Rather, as
 
this court concluded in Wheeler, the State need only allege the
 
statutory definition of a term when it creates an additional
 
essential element of the offense, and the term itself does not
 
-14­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
provide a person of common understanding with fair notice of that 
element. See Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180 (“In 
general, ‘[w]here the statute sets forth with reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and 
fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn 
in the language of the statute is sufficient.’”) (citations 
omitted) (brackets in original). 
The second significant factor discussed by this court 
when analyzing the sufficiency of the charge in Wheeler was 
whether the term “operate” gave the defendant fair notice of the 
requirement that the proscribed conduct occur on a public way, 
street, road, or highway. 121 Hawai
'i at 393-96, 219 P.3d at 
1181-83. Specifically, this court considered whether the statutory definition of the term “operate” is “readily 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding[,]” namely 
whether a person would understand that to “operate” means not only 
that a person “perform[s] a function, or operation” but also 
includes the additional requirement of doing so “upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway.” Id. This court contrasted the 
situation in Wheeler with that in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974). In Hamling, the petitioners challenged the
 
sufficiency of an indictment which charged them with the “use of
 
the mails to carry an obscene book,” arguing that although the
 
indictment tracked the language of the statute, it did not provide
 
them with adequate notice because it failed to include the
 
definition of the term “obscenity.” Id. at 91, 117. The United
 
States Supreme Court rejected that argument, holding that
 “obscenity” “is a term sufficiently definite in legal meaning to
 
give a defendant notice of the charge against him.” Id. at 118­
19. 
We emphasized that Hamling was distinguishable from the
 
-15­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circumstances in Wheeler because “the term ‘obscenity’ itself 
provided a person of common understanding with some notice of the 
nature of the prohibited conduct. In contrast, ‘operate’ has been 
statutorily defined . . . in a manner that does not comport with 
its commonly understood definition.” Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 394, 
219 P.3d at 1181. Specifically, this court recognized that the common understanding of the term “operate” “does not 
geographically limit where the conduct must take place.” Id. 
Therefore, merely including the term “operate” in the charge, without providing the defendant with notice that his conduct must 
have occurred “upon a public way, street, road, or highway[,]” 
rendered the charge insufficient. Id. at 394-96, 219 P.3d at 
1181-83. 
The charge in the instant case, like that in Wheeler,
 
tracked the language of the relevant ordinance, ROH § 7-2.3. 
However, in contrast to Wheeler, “animal nuisance” is consistent
 
with its commonly-understood meaning and provides a defendant with
 
notice of what is being charged. The dictionary definitions of
 
both “animal” and “nuisance” support this conclusion. The term
 
“animal” is defined as “[a]ny living creature other than a human
 
being[,]” Black’s Law Dictionary 102 (9th ed. 2009) or “a mammal
 
as distinguished from a bird, reptile, or other nonmammal.”
 
Webster’s 3rd International Dictionary of the English Language
 
Unabridged 85 (3d ed. 1967) (hereinafter “Webster’s”). The term
 
“nuisance” is defined as “[a] condition, activity, or situation
 
(such as a loud noise or foul odor) that interferes with the use
 
or enjoyment of property[,]” Black’s Law Dictionary at 1171, or
 
“an offensive, annoying, unpleasant, or obnoxious thing or
 
practice: a cause or source of annoyance that although often a
 
single act is usu[ally] a continuing or repeated invasion or
 
disturbance of another’s right[,]” Webster’s at 1548, or “a
 
person, thing, or circumstance causing inconvenience or
 
-16­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
annoyance[,]” The New Oxford American Dictionary 1175 (2001).
 
Thus, a person of common understanding would have fair
 
notice that “animal nuisance” could include the various examples
 
of conduct provided in ROH § 7-2.2: that the animal, for example,
 
(1) continuously makes noise for at least ten minutes or
 
intermittently for a half hour or more so as to disturb others,
 
(2) barks, whines, howls, crows, cries or makes other unreasonable
 
noises, or (3) bites or stings a person, all of which would cause
 
damage, annoyance or inconvenience to others. Unlike Wheeler,
 
where it could not be said that a person would understand that the
 
term “operate” necessarily means that they must do so on a public
 
street or roadway, there is nothing contained within the
 
definition of “animal nuisance” in ROH § 7-2.2 that cannot be
 
discerned from its common usage. Rather, like in Hamling, 418
 
U.S. at 102, where the United States Supreme Court held that the
 
term “obscene” provided the petitioners with sufficient notice,
 
the common meaning of the term “animal nuisance” is sufficiently
 
broad enough to encompass the component parts of its definition. 
The charge against Mita which tracked the language of ROH § 7-2.3
 
without further defining “animal nuisance” was therefore
 
sufficient.
 
Moreover, in contrast to Wheeler, the charge against
 
Mita contained other information that provided her with fair
 
notice of the offense charged. Pursuant to HRPP Rule 7(a), when a
 
defendant is accused of an offense that is subject to a maximum
 
sentence of less than six months imprisonment, and the defendant
 
is issued a citation rather than placed under arrest, the citation
 
and the oral charge are considered together to be the complaint. 
HRPP Rule 7(a).9 Here, the maximum sentence for a violation of
 
9
 HRPP Rule 7(a) states in relevant part: “[I]n any case where a
defendant is accused of an offense that is subject to a maximum sentence of
less than six months in prison . . . and is issued a citation in lieu of
(continued...)
 
-17­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the offense of animal nuisance is thirty days imprisonment. ROH
 
§ 7-2.10(b). Therefore, when analyzing the sufficiency of the
 
charge of animal nuisance against Mita, this court considers both
 
the citation issued to Mita, as well as the oral charge against
 
her. When doing so, it is clear that all the essential elements
 
of the charge were properly alleged. 
As noted above, the citation, signed by Mita, stated
 
that Mita “[d]id on/or about this 3 day of June Yr 08 at about
 
1940-2050 did own, harbour or keep (animal description): Boxers
 
Name Roxy/Obie Color Brown . . . at (location): [Mita’s residence
 
address] and did commit the offense of: . . . animal nuisance-
Sec.: 7-2.3 Barking Dog[.]” The citation also had a section
 
entitled “Officer’s Report” which stated that “Mita was issued a
 
Barking 3rd citation. She was already issued a previous Barking 2
 
warning citation.” Mita’s citation therefore put her on notice
 
that she was cited for violating ROH § 7-2.3 (her third citation)
 
because her two dogs were barking. Thus, when the DPA orally
 
charged Mita prior to trial, alleging that she was the owner of an
 
animal that engaged in animal nuisance, Mita had fair notice that
 
the charge was due to her dogs, Roxy and Obie, barking in a manner
 
that disturbed others. Accordingly, the ICA erred in concluding
 
that the charge was insufficient. Cf. State v. Baker, 55 Haw.
 
621, 622-23, 525 P.2d 571, 572 (1974) (holding that the indictment
 charging defendant with forgery in the second degree was
 
sufficient, although inarticulately drawn due to technical errors
 
in its wording, because it “provided the [defendant] with
 
sufficient facts to put him on reasonable notice of the charges
 
against him”) (emphasis added). 
9(...continued)
physical arrest pursuant to Section 803-6(b) of the [HRS] and summoned to
appear in court, the citation and an oral recitation of the essential facts
constituting the offense charged as set forth in Rule 5(b)(1), shall be deemed
the complaint, notwithstanding any waiver of the recitation.” See also supra
,
 
note 6. 
-18­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In sum, the charge against Mita, comprised of both the
 
citation and oral charge, provided her with fair notice of the
 
offense of animal nuisance. The significant factors in Wheeler
 
which caused this court to conclude that the charge was
 
insufficient are not present here. While the charge in Wheeler
 
contained a hidden element, the statutory definition of the term
 
“animal nuisance” does not create an additional essential element
 
of the offense of animal nuisance, and, in any event, is
 
consistent with the commonly understood meaning of the term.
 
Accordingly, the charge against Mita was sufficient.
 
As noted above, the ICA did not address any of the other
 
issues raised by Mita in her opening brief. Additionally, neither
 
party has requested that they be addressed here. Accordingly, in
 
light of our holding that the ICA erred in concluding that the
 
charge against Mita was insufficient, we remand this case to the
 
ICA to address Mita’s remaining issues.
 
IV. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the charge
 
against Mita was sufficient and remand this case to the ICA to
 
address the remaining issues raised in Mita’s opening brief.
