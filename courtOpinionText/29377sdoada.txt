(CASE NOS. 1DTA 08-01535 & DTI 08-041698)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Petitioner-Defendant-Appellant, Robert Michael Anderson
(“Anderson”) petitions this court to review the Intermediate
Court of Appeals’ (“ICA’s”) September 16, 2009 judgment on
appeal.  The ICA’s judgment was entered pursuant to the court’s
September 24, 2009 summary disposition order affirming the
District Court of the First Circuit’s (“trial court’s”)1 judgment
convicting Anderson of operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant (“OVUII”), in violation of Hawai #i Revised Statutes
(HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2008),2 and*** NOT  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
a five-year period by a conviction for an offense
under this section or section 291E-4(a):
(A) A fourteen-hour minimum substance
abuse rehabilitation program, including
education and counseling, or other comparable
program deemed appropriate by the court;
(B) Ninety-day prompt suspension of
license and privilege to operate a vehicle
during the suspension period, or the court may
impose, in lieu of the ninety-day prompt
suspension of license, a minimum thirty-day
prompt suspension of license with absolute
prohibition from operating a vehicle and, for
the remainder of the ninety-day period, a
restriction on the license that allows the
person to drive for limited work-related
purposes and to participate in substance abuse
treatment programs;
(C) Any one or more of the following:
(i) Seventy-two hours of community
service work;
(ii) Not less than forty-eight hours
and not more than five days of
imprisonment; or
(iii)
 A fine of not less than $150
but not more than $1,000;
(D) A surcharge of $25 to be deposited
into the neurotrauma special fund; and
(E) May be charged a surcharge of up to
$25 to be deposited into the trauma system
special fund if the court so orders[.]
Anderson has not appealed his conviction for violating HRS § 291C-3
38.
2disregarding longitudinal traffic lane markings, in violation of
HRS § 291C-38 (2007).3  In his application for writ of certiorari
before this court, Anderson asserts that (1) the ICA gravely
erred “in holding that the [OVUII] charge against [Anderson] was
sufficient because the [Respondent-Plaintiff-Appellee, State of
Hawai#i (‘prosecution’)] was not required to allege that
[Anderson] was traveling on a public way, street, road, or
highway in order to convict him of the offense of OVUII,” and,
(2) “[u]pon [r]emand to the [t]rial [c]ourt, the [p]roper
[r]emedy is [d]ismissal [w]ith [p]rejudice [b]ecause the*** NOT  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
3[o]riginal OVUII [c]harge is [t]ime-[b]arred by the [s]tatute of
[l]imitations.”
Upon carefully reviewing the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we hold that:  (1)
the ICA gravely erred in affirming the trial court’s judgment
because the ICA’s decision is obviously inconsistent with this
court’s recently published opinion in State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai#i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), and (2) this case is remanded
to the district court to give the parties an opportunity to more
fully develop the record with regard to the statute of
limitations issue, and decide whether the appropriate remedy in
this case is either dismissal with or without prejudice.
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s September 16, 2009
judgment on appeal and the district court’s August 28, 2008
judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district
court for further proceedings consistent with this order.
