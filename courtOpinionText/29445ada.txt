OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that (1) an instruction on Hawai' i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 703-309 (1993) (parental discipline defense),1
 
1
 HRS § 703-309 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
Use of force by persons with special responsibility
for care, discipline, or safety of others. The use of force
 
upon or toward the person of another is justifiable under
the following circumstances :
(1)	 The actor is the parent or guardian or other
person similarly responsible for the general
care and supervision of a minor, or a person
(continued...)
         
  
      
        
     
     
     
     
        
      
   
     
 
 
         
  
      
 
     
    
  
   
       
     
  
   
        
         
 
   
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
is not per se precluded by the fact that substantial bodily
 
injury occurred; (2) as with other defenses, an instruction to
 the jury on the parental discipline defense must be given so long
 as there is some evidence in the record to support each element
 of the defense, no matter how weak, inconclusive, or
 unsatisfactory that evidence may be; and (3) an instruction on
 HRS § 707-712(2) (1993) (mutual affray) must be given along with
 an instruction on Assault in the Third Degree, HRS § 707-712(1),

1(...continued)
 
acting  a t  the  request  of  the  parent,  guardian,
or  other  responsible  person,  and:
(a
)	 The force is employed with due regard for
the age and size of the minor and is
reasonably related to the purpose of
safeguarding or promoting the welfare of
the minor, including the prevention or
punishment of the minor’s misconduct; and
 
(b)	 The force used is not designed to cause or
known to create a risk of causing
substantial bodily injury , disfigurement,
extreme pain or mental distress, or
neurological damage.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
HRS § 707-700 (1993) defines “substantial bodily injury” as bodily
 
injury which causes:
 
(1)	 A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of
the skin;
 
(2)	 A chemical, electrical, friction, or scalding
burn of second degree severity;
 
(3)	 A bone fracture ;
(4)	 A serious concussion; or
 
(5)	 A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the
esophagus, viscera, or other internal organs.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
2
 HRS § 707-712 provides:
 
Assault in the third degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of assault in the third degree if
the person:
(a)	 Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
causes bodily injury to another person; or
 
. . . .

            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
if there is any evidence that the injury was inflicted during the
 
course of a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent. 
Inasmuch as there was some evidence in the record to support an
 instruction on the parental discipline defense, such an
 instruction requested by Respondent/Defendant-Appellant Cedric K.
 Kikuta (Respondent) was required to be given to the jury by the
 Family Court of the First Circuit (the court).
3 Additionally,
 
under the circumstances, it was necessary to provide the jury
 with a mutual affray instruction, along with the Assault in the
 Third Degree instruction, where there was some evidence that the
 injury was inflicted during a fight entered into by mutual
 consent. 
Accordingly, the June 8, 2010 judgment of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed pursuant to its May 18,
 
4
2010 memorandum opinion,  vacating the court’s October 1, 2008
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence for its failure to instruct
 the jury on the parental discipline defense is affirmed in part,
 but is vacated in part as to the lack of disposition regarding a
 mutual affray instruction. The case is remanded for retrial.
 
2(...continued)
 
(2) Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor
unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by
mutual consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor .

 The majority memorandum opinion was issued by Associate Judges
 
Daniel R. Foley and Alexa D.M. Fujise, with Chief Judge Nakamura dissenting.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
We emphasize that our holding in no way condones the 
use of illegal force against minors. As acknowledged by the 
legislature, “‘the line between physical abuse and appropriate parental discipline is a very subjective one. What one parent considers discipline may seem abusive to another.’” State v. 
Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 161, 166 P.3d 322, 334 (2007) (quoting 
Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2493, in 1992 Senate Journal, at 1121). However, because a defendant is “entitled to have the trier of fact consider a defense having any support in the evidence no matter how weak, inconclusive, or unsatisfactory the evidence involved[,]” State v. Riveira, 59 Haw. 148, 153, 577 P.2d 793, 797 (1978), we consider only whether there was any evidence in the record supporting an instruction on the parental discipline and mutual affray defenses. We need not consider, today, the merits of whether Petitioner’s use of force crossed the “‘line between physical abuse and appropriate parental discipline,’” Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 149, 166 P.3d at 334, but 
hold only that Petitioner was entitled to have the jury, not the court, consider those defenses under the circumstances of this case.

The following essential matters, some verbatim, are
 
from the record and the submissions of the parties. 
On October 9, 2007, Respondent was charged by written
 
complaint with Assault in the Second Degree, HRS § 707-711(1)

             ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Supp. 2007).5 On June 16, 2008, Respondent was convicted by a
 
jury for Assault in the Third Degree.
 
Complainant’s Testimony
 
Respondent’s step-son Justin (Complainant) was fourteen
 
years old at the time of the incident. As of that date, he had
 been living with his mother (Mother) and Respondent for
 approximately five years, and he and Respondent “never really got
 along.” On September 30, 2007, Complainant was sitting in the
 “game room” of his home watching video programs with his cousin
 Chad (Cousin), when Respondent entered and told Complainant to
 feed his dog. Complainant told Respondent that he “would do it
 in five minutes” and when five minutes had elapsed, he fed the
 dog and cleaned the dog’s bowl. According to Complainant,
 Respondent then noticed a stain on the floor that the dog had
 made, and Respondent instructed Complainant to clean it up. When
 Complainant told Respondent that he “couldn’t because it was a
 stain[,]” Respondent stated, “I bet I could get it out.”
6 In
 
response, Complainant answered, “I bet you not.” Respondent then
 told Complainant that if Respondent was able to get the stain
 
5	 HRS § 707-711 provides in relevant part:
 
Assault in the second degree. (1) A person commits
the offense of assault in the second degree if:
(a)	 The person intentionally or knowingly
causes substantial bodily injury to
another;
 
(b)	 The person recklessly causes serious or
substantial bodily injury to another[.]
 
6
 On cross-examination, Complainant testified that he remembered
 
providing a written statement to a police officer in which he first stated
that he had told Respondent, “I bet you can’t” get the stain out.
 
5
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
out, Complainant “was going to be grounded for a year.” 
Complainant then told Respondent that if Respondent could not,
 Complainant “would get to kick [Respondent] in the leg” and
 Respondent said “okay.” Respondent had recently had surgery on
 his leg and was walking with a cast that extended from his hip to
 the ball of his foot, with the aid of crutches. 
When Respondent left the room, Complainant “slammed the
 
door” because he “was mad[,]” thinking he was about to lose the
 bet since Respondent “works with carpet” and he “was pretty sure”
 Respondent “could get [the stain] out.” Immediately after,
 Respondent “slammed the door back open, and . . . pushed
 [Complainant]” and he “fell [] backwards into the glass door.” 
When Complainant got up, Respondent “pushe[d Complainant] back
 down.” Complainant then “grabbed the crutch” that had fallen on
 the floor. According to Complainant, he did so because he knew
 that Respondent could not run or walk without the crutches and
 Complainant “thought he could get away” by grabbing them. 
Complainant explained that as he was holding the crutch
 
“sideways” and about “to run on the side of [Respondent,]”
 Respondent pushed the crutch toward [Complainant] and punched
 [him] in the face five times[.]” When Complainant “got to his
 knees and covered [his] head” because his “face hurt,” Respondent
 “punched [him] on the back of [his] head [] two or three times.” 
When asked to describe the force used, Complainant stated that
 the punches were “hard enough to break [his] nose” and that the
 
6
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
same amount of force was used by Respondent when punching the
 
back of Complainant’s head. 
Complainant subsequently noticed that his nose was
 
bleeding and that his face was swollen. His nose stopped
 bleeding after about half-an-hour and healed in about a week. 
Complainant also stated that his teeth were chipped, and he had
 them fixed by his dentist. When Mother came home, he related
 what happened to her. Complainant, Cousin, and Mother “left the
 home and went “straight to K-Mart[,]” then “to church[,]” and
 after church, to the hospital where Complainant was treated for
 his injuries. 
When Complainant was asked whether he had “ever act[ed]
 
like [he] was going to hit [Respondent], he responded, “I don’t
 think so[,]” or “[i]f I did, I didn’t mean to.” He explained, “I
 may have looked like I did, but I didn’t actually do it.” 
According to Complainant, he had tried to move past Respondent
 while holding the crutch, “but never towards him.” However,
 Complainant conceded on cross-examination that “when he stood up
 with [the] crutch, . . . [he] figured that [Respondent] thought
 [Complainant was] going to whack him with it.” 
Cousin’s Testimony
 
At trial, Cousin testified that he was thirteen years
 
old at the time of the incident and fourteen years old at the
 time of trial. Cousin related that he and Complainant were
 watching video programs when Respondent came in and told
 
7
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Complainant to feed the dog. After Complainant did so,
 
Respondent came back into the room and “start[ed] complaining
 about [a] dog stain on the ground.” Cousin stated that when
 Respondent told Complainant to clean it, Complainant said, “[Y]ou
 can since [Respondent] want[ed] to make a bet with
 [Complainant.]” Respondent told Complainant that if he was able
 to remove the stain, Complainant would get “a year’s grounding
 from T.V.” and Complainant would get “nothing if he [won].” But
 then, Complainant said, “I get to kick you in the leg[,]” and
 Respondent said “all right.” 
After Respondent left the room, Complainant “slam[med]
 
the door on [Respondent].” Respondent then opened the door,
 “limp[ed] in kind of quickly” and “lunge[d] at [Complainant.]” 
Complainant was “tackled into the [] sliding door” and the
 jalousies fell.” As Complainant was trying to get off the
 sliding door, Respondent “hit[] him about four or five times in
 the face.” Complainant “put[] his hands over his head . . .
 defensively[,]” and Respondent hit Complainant in the head
 “[m]aybe fifteen times.” 
Cousin related that Complainant then stood up, grabbed
 
a crutch from the floor, and held it in a defensive manner. 
Respondent then told Complainant that he “should use the crutch
 against him and [] fight[,]” but Complainant “didn’t do
 anything”; just “kind on like backing off.” After the incident,
 Cousin noticed that Complainant’s “face was swelled,” and “teeth
 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
were chipped, and Complainant also “had a bleeding nose.” 
Respondent’s Testimony
 
Respondent had been married to Mother for six years and
 
met Complainant six years prior to trial, when Complainant was
 about eight years old. At the time of the incident he was living
 with Complainant, Mother, and Complainant’s grandmother. He was
 the father figure in Complainant’s life and Complainant called
 him “dad,” and Respondent referred to Complainant as his “son.” 
According to Respondent, he and Complainant had a “[f]ather and
 son relationship” and did “all kinds of stuff” together,
 including “fishing, camping, from box cars to go-carts, to even
 talking about how to drive a regular car.” Respondent related
 that during the course of their relationship, he would sometimes
 have to reprimand Complainant. 
Prior to the incident, Respondent “popped [his]
 
Achilles” while playing basketball and went to the emergency room
 to be treated. Following surgery, Respondent’s leg was wrapped
 in a cast which went from his hip to the ball of his foot. As a
 result, he was unable to place his toes on the ground, put any
 weight on his leg, or keep his balance and therefore, needed
 crutches to move around. Respondent explained that if he were to
 put any weight on his foot, he would stretch his Achilles tendon
 and his foot was already very tender. 
As to the incident, Respondent explained that he
 
entered the game room and asked Complainant to complete some
 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
chores, including feeding the dog and cleaning the dog’s “mess.” 
Complainant asked Respondent to “give [him] a few minutes,” which
 Respondent did. After Complainant fed the dog, Respondent asked
 him to put away the dog food. Complainant then got “pretty mad
 and started slamming stuff[.]” Around that time, Respondent
 noticed a stain on the ground, which Respondent described as dog
 “diarrhea.” He indicated that when he asked Complainant to clean
 it up, Complainant answered, “I can’t get it up.” When he told
 Complainant, “[Y]ou can,” Complainant responded, “[Y]ou wanna
 bet?” Respondent told the Complainant that he would be grounded
 for a year if Respondent was able to remove the stain. 
Complainant then stated that if he won the bet, “he could kick
 [Respondent] in the leg” that had been operated on. When
 Respondent left the room to obtain supplies to clean the stain,
 Complainant “lost it” because Respondent normally grounded
 Complainant for the “whole length.” Complainant then slammed the
 sliding glass door. 
Respondent related when Complainant slammed the glass
 
door it made him “upset because [Respondent] told [Complainant]
 many times [not to slam the door]” and he felt like Complainant
 had done that to “get back” at him. At that time, Respondent re­entered the game room and called Complainant but Complainant did
 not answer or look at him. When he called Complainant a second
 time, Complainant again did “[n]othing” and “ignor[ed him].” 
After being ignored again, Respondent went up to Complainant and
 
10
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
pushed him with two hands on his shoulders. Because Respondent
 
“was off-balance,” his crutches fell from under his arms, and as
 a result, Respondent “pushed [Complainant] harder than [he]
 wanted to,” causing Complainant to hit his head on the sliding
 door. 
According to Respondent, Complainant then picked up
 
Respondent’s crutch with two hands, came up off the floor, and
 swung the crutch at him. Respondent “blocked [the swing] and []
 hit him” two times, but was not aiming for Complaint’s face. 
Respondent explained that he punched Complainant “to try to make
 him let go of th[e] crutch” and was not “aiming anywhere[,]” but
 “just reacting[.]” Respondent did not notice any injuries to
 Complainant’s face, chipped teeth, or bleeding. After he struck
 Complainant, Respondent talked to him calmly and stated, “[W]hat
 makes you think you could stand up to dad, you know. Don’t do
 that, you know.” 
II.
 
In settling jury instructions, defense counsel asserted 
that Respondent had struck Complainant in self-defense and that Respondent was also entitled to a jury instruction on the parental discipline defense because the defense had “raised or provided a scintilla of evidence that would require [the] instruction [to] be given.” Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (Petitioner) argued that Respondent was precluded from 
asserting the parental discipline defense because Respondent had 
11
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
caused substantial bodily injury to Complainant. Defense counsel
 
conceded that Respondent had caused Complainant substantial
 bodily injury, but argued that the issue of whether or not the
 force used against Complainant was designed to cause or known to
 create a risk of causing substantial bodily injury was a question
 for the jury. 
The court declined to give an instruction on the
 
parental discipline defense on the ground that the force used
 against Complainant had resulted in substantial bodily injury. 
The court stated that “in this particular case under [the]
 circumstances, there’s no dispute that the force caused or
 resulted in substantially [sic] bodily injury, which is defined
 by statute[,] which includes the fracture[, s]o the [c]ourt will
 refuse [the parental discipline instruction] over objection by
 [Respondent].” 
III.
 
A.
 
On appeal to the ICA, Respondent argued that the court
 
erred in failing to instruct the jurors (1) on the parental
 discipline defense and (2) on whether the assault in the third
 degree occurred during the course of a fight or scuffle entered
 into by mutual consent, i.e., mutual affray. Respondent
 maintained that a defendant is “entitled to an instruction on any
 defense or theory of the defense supported by the evidence, ‘no
 matter how weak, unsatisfactory, or inconclusive.’” (Quoting
 
12
         
         
         
          
          
          
        
        
          
         
      
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
State v. Auld, 114 Hawai' i 135, 144, 157 P.3d 574, 583 (2007).) 
In order to invoke the parental discipline defense, a defendant 
is required to make a showing that the record contained some evidence supporting the following elements: 
(1) [the defendant] was a parent, guardian, or other person
as described in HRS § 703-309(1); (2) [the defendant] used
force against a minor for whose care and supervision he was
responsible; (3) his [or her] use of force was with due
regard to the age and size of the recipient and reasonably
related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the
welfare of the minor, including the prevention or punishment
of misconduct; and (4) the force used was not designed to
cause, or known to create a risk of causing, substantial
bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental
distress, or neurological damage.
 
State v. Miller, 105 Hawai' i 394, 401, 98 P.3d 265, 272 (App. 
2004). 
As to the first element of the parental discipline
 
defense, Respondent asserted that “[t]he scope of HRS § 703-309
 
extends to, ‘a parent or guardian or other person similarly
 responsible for the general care and supervision of a minor[.]” 
According to Respondent, “it was undisputed that [he] was
 [Complainant’s] step-father . . . and that he basically raised
 [Complainant] as his own son.” 
As to the second element, Respondent maintained that it
 
was undisputed that he, as Complainant’s step-father, “was
 responsible for supporting, caring for and disciplining
 [Complainant].” Respondent pointed out that in fact, on the date
 of the incident, Mother “had gone out, leaving [Respondent] to
 care for and supervise [Complainant].”
 
13
         
         
             
            
             
         
             
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As to the third element, HRS § 703-309(1)(a),
 
Respondent asserted that “there was evidence that [Respondent’s] 
use of force was with due regard to [Complainant’s] age and size and was reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting [Complainant’s] welfare, including the prevention or punishment of misconduct.” Respondent noted that at the time of the incident, Complainant was “5’ 10” to 6’ tall and weighed around 160 pounds” and Respondent “was 5’ 7” tall and weighed approximately 185 to 190 pounds[].”
7 Moreover, “the description 
of the force employed varied . . . from two to four to five punches to the face to five punches to the back of the head.” Respondent urged that whether or not “this force was ‘with due regard’ to [Complainant’s] age and size and ‘reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting’ [Complainant’s] welfare” was a question for the jury and to be determined “on a case-by-case basis.” (Quoting Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 165, 166 
P.3d at 338.) 
With respect to the fourth element, HRS § 703­
309(1)(b), regarding whether the force used was designed to cause
 or known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury,
 Respondent argued that “HRS § 703-309 prohibits not the result of 
7
 It is noted that although Respondent maintained in his opening
 
brief that he weighed approximately 185 to 190 pounds at the time of the
incident, he testified that “[w]hen he had his cast on [he] gained about
 [twenty-two] pounds.” It is unclear as to whether the 185 to 190 pounds
included the twenty-two pounds which Respondent had gained, or whether
Respondent had gained twenty-two pounds while he had his cast on and then lost
it prior to trial.
 
14
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the force, but the degree of force which is employed.” (Citing 
Miller, 105 Hawai' i at 399, 98 P.3d at 270.) He maintained that 
whether the nature of the force was either (1) designed to cause substantial bodily injury or (2) known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury is “a question of fact that should have been submitted to the jury, not a basis for [the] rejection of the instruction[.]” 
As to the first prong of HRS § 703-309(1)(b),
 
Respondent contended that there was testimony that the force used
 was not designed to cause substantial bodily injury as evidenced
 by his testimony that he had hit Complainant as a “reaction” to
 Complainant swinging a crutch at him, and not with a design to
 cause substantial bodily injury. As to the second prong,
 Respondent contended that it was “questionable whether he would
 have known that [by hitting Complainant], he was creating a risk
 of causing [Complainant] substantial bodily injury[,]” as
 evidenced by the testimony of Complainant’s treating physician
 that “the nose bone was easily broken because it was a thin
 bone.” According to Respondent, he “did not realize that the
 degree of force he used could so easily result in a broken nose.” 
In connection with his second argument, Respondent
 
contended that his description of the incident at trial “provided
 an evidentiary basis by which the jury could have found that the
 Assault in the Third Degree occurred during a fight or scuffle
 entered into by mutual consent, i.e. mutual affray.” Respondent
 
15
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
asserted that such an instruction was supported by his testimony
 
that he had pushed Complainant, that Complainant then picked up a
 crutch and swung it at him, and only then did he react by hitting
 Complainant. Respondent maintained that he was entitled to an
 instruction on mutual affray “so long as there was any support in
 the evidence for an instruction on the issue[,]” even if such an
 instruction “were deemed inconsistent with a defense of self-
defense[.]”
 
B.
 
In response to Respondent’s argument regarding the 
parental discipline instruction, Petitioner contended that “by virtue of the nature of [Complainant’s] injuries caused by [Respondent’s] attack[,]” Respondent “was per se unable to support the parental discipline defense which proscribes force sufficient to cause serious bodily injury including fracture” under HRS § 703-309(1)(b). Although the previous argument was the only theory raised by Petitioner at trial to support its argument that Respondent was not entitled to a parental discipline defense instruction, Petitioner also argued on appeal that the force used was not reasonably proportional to the alleged misconduct of Complainant, i.e., “slamming the glass door and giving [Respondent] ‘attitude[,]’” “nor could it be supposed to be necessary to protect the welfare of [Complainant]” under HRS § 703-309(1)(a). (Citing State v. Tanielu, 82 Hawai' i 373, 
381, 922 P.2d 986, 994 (App. 1996) (noting that, there, the ICA 
16
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
upheld the trial court’s denial of a parental discipline defense 
instruction, where the fourteen-year-old “daughter was punched (with a closed fist in the face), [and] slapped and kicked”)). According to Petitioner, here, as in Tanielu, “‘the viciousness of the attack’ . . . severed any relationship between the use of force and the welfare of [Complainant] which might be considered ‘reasonable.’” (Quoting Tanielu, 82 Hawai' i at 381, 922 P.2d at 
994.) (Brackets omitted.) 
In further support of its argument that the force used 
in this case was not reasonably proportional to Complainant’s misconduct, Petitioner cited to State v. Crouser, 81 Hawai' i 5, 
12-13, 911 P.2d 725, 732-33 (1996), where the defendant punished his fourteen-year-old daughter for forging a school progress report by hitting her across both sides of her face, knocking her to the floor, throwing her on the bed, and hitting across her bare buttocks with a plastic bat causing the bat to break. There, Petitioner noted, this court affirmed the defendant’s conviction of abuse of a family member over the defendant’s claim of a parental discipline defense, reasoning that the force used upon the daughter exceeded the permissible level of discipline. Additionally, Petitioner contended that “beating a person in the head with closed fists is known to create a risk of causing substantial bodily and/or neurological damage.” (Citing Miller, 105 Hawai' i at 399, 98 P.3d at 270) (stating that “striking the 
17
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
victim about the head did create the risk of causing substantial
 
bodily injury or neurological damage”)).
 
Finally, with respect to Respondent’s argument 
regarding a mutual affray instruction, Petitioner urged that because no objection was made by Respondent at trial, this court should notice the error for “plain error,” only if “‘[the] erroneous instruction affected the substantial rights of [the] defendant.’” (Quoting State v. Pauline, 100 Hawai' i 356, 380, 60 
P.3d 306, 330 (2002).) Also, Petitioner argued that even if Respondent was entitled to such an instruction, any error in that regard was harmless because “the jury convicted [Respondent] of an included offense (Assault in the Third Degree, misdemeanor) greater than the included offense (of petty misdemeanor Mutual Affray)[.]” (Citing State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 405, 415-16, 16 
P.3d 246, 256-57 (2001) (for the proposition that the court’s failure to give an instruction on a lesser included offense “is harmless when the jury convicts the defendant of the charged offense or of an included offense greater than the included offense erroneously omitted from the instructions”)).

On May 18, 2010, the ICA filed its Memorandum Opinion. 
As to Respondent’s argument that he was entitled to an
 instruction on the parental discipline defense, the ICA majority
 determined that the question was not, as the court concluded,
 
18
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
whether the force used resulted in substantial bodily injury, but 
whether the force “was ‘designed to cause or known to create a risk of causing’ substantial bodily injury. HRS § 703-309(1)(b).” State v. Kikuta, No. 29445, 2010 WL 2017646, at 
*10 (May 18, 2010) (mem.) (citing Miller, 105 Hawai' i at 399, 98 
P.3d at 270) (emphasis added). The ICA majority observed that “[a]ccording to the plain language of HRS § 703-309, what type and degree of force broke Complainant’s nose and whether that force was designed to break his nose or known to create a risk of doing so was a question for the jury, as fact finder, to decide.” Id. (citing State v. Romano, 114 Hawai' i 1, 8, 155 P.3d 1102, 1109 
(2007) (“Matters of credibility and the weight of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn are for the fact finder.”)). 
The ICA majority determined that “[t]here is a question
 
of fact as to whether [Respondent’s] force against Complainant
 was designed to cause or known to create a risk of causing
 substantial bodily injury.” Id. The majority reasoned that the
 
point during the incident at which Respondent broke Complainant’s
 nose “is unclear” inasmuch as the “[e]vidence adduced at trial
 showed that [Respondent] pushed Complainant backward against a
 door jamb or glass door, allegedly tackled him twice, punched him
 in the face anywhere from two to ten times, and allegedly punched
 him in the back of the head two or three times.” Id. Because of
 
the variance in testimony at trial, the majority believed that
 “even though [Respondent] caused Complainant to suffer
 
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
substantial bodily injury, a jury may have found that
 
[Respondent] did not use force that was ‘designed to cause or
 known to create a risk of causing’ substantial bodily injury.” 
Id. (quoting HRS § 703-309(1)(b)). Consequently, the majority
 concluded that “the family court erred by not submitting the
 instruction on the parental discipline defense to the jury[,]”
 vacated Respondent’s conviction, and remanded for a new trial. 
Id. The ICA majority “[chose] not to address” Respondent’s
 
argument regarding a mutual affray instruction. Id.
 
2.
 
The ICA dissent maintained that, as to the parental
 
discipline instruction, there was insufficient evidence that the
 force employed by Respondent against Complainant (1) “was
 ‘reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting
 the welfare of [Complainant]’” or (2) “was not ‘known to create a
 risk of causing substantial bodily injury, extreme pain or mental
 distress, or neurological damage.’” Id. at *11 (Nakamura, C.J.,
 
dissenting). As to (1), the dissent stated that Respondent’s
 “acts of punching [Complainant] multiple times in the face and
 breaking his nose cannot be justified as being for the purpose of
 safeguarding or promoting [Complainant’s] welfare.” Id. 
According to the dissent, Respondent “did not testify that his
 use of force was done with the intent to safeguard or promote the
 welfare of [Complainant], or even to punish [Complainant] for his 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
misconduct or prevent future misconduct. Instead, [Respondent]
 
simply testified that he was ‘upset.’” Id.
 
As to (2), the dissent stated that even if the nature
 
of the conduct, and not the result of the conduct, is
 determinative in assessing whether the force used is permissible
 under HRS § 703-309(1)(b), “the nature of his conduct--a minimum
 of two punches to the face of [Complainant]--was clearly the type
 of conduct known to create a risk of causing substantial bodily
 injury, extreme pain, mental distress, or neurological damage.” 
Id. at *12.
 
As to an instruction on mutual affray, the dissent
 
stated that “mutual affray is ‘a fight or scuffle entered into by
 mutual consent,’” id. (quoting HRS § 707-712(2) (1993)) (brackets
 omitted), and (a) Respondent “testified that he punched
 [Complainant] in self-defense without thinking and in reaction to
 [Complainant’s] swinging a crutch at him,” and (b) Complainant
 and Cousin testified that Complainant “did not attempt to swing
 the crutch at Respondent and did not take any aggressive action
 toward Respondent[,]” id. Thus, according to the dissent,
 
“[t]here was no evidence that [Respondent] and [Complainant] had
 entered into a fight or scuffle by mutual consent.” Id.
 
IV.
 
On June 29, 2010, Petitioner filed an application for
 
writ of certiorari (Application), urging this court to review the 
21
         
          
        
      
   
         
          
        
        
         
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Memorandum Opinion of the ICA. Petitioner presents the following
 
questions in its Application:
 
A.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred as a matter of law and
fact in holding that the [] court should have
submitted an instruction on a parental discipline
defense to the jury[.]
 
B.	 Whether the ICA gravely erred in failing to find that
the [] court did not commit plain error in failing to
give a mutual affray instruction with respect to the
lesser include offense of Assault in the Third Degree.
 
V.
 
A.
 
With respect to the first question, Petitioner 
maintains that because the requirements of HRS § 703-309 are set out in the conjunctive, rather than the disjunctive, a defendant “need only fail to fulfill any one element in order to fail to sustain the [] defense.” (Citing Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 13, 911 
P.2d at 733.) Petitioner additionally raises similar contentions to those raised on appeal to the ICA. As to the first prong of 
8
the third element  of the parental discipline defense, HRS § 703­
309(1)(a), Petitioner contended that Respondent failed to adduce evidence that the force employed was with due regard for the age and size of the minor. As to the second prong of the third element, Petitioner contended that the force used was “so excessive that it is no longer reasonably related to safeguarding the welfare of the minor[.]” (Citing 
Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 12, 
911 P.2d at 732.) 
8
 Petitioner did not raise contentions relating to the first or
 
second element of the parental discipline defense.
 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As to the fourth element, Petitioner argues that even
 
if the nature of the force, as opposed to the result of the
 
force, is determinative under HRS § 703-309(1)(b), “‘the nature
 of [Respondent’s] conduct--a minimum of two punches to the face
 of [Complainant]--was clearly the type of conduct known to create
 a risk of causing substantial bodily injury, extreme pain, mental
 distress, or neurological damage.’” (Quoting Kikuta, 2010 WL
 2017646, at *12 (Nakamura, C.J., dissenting).) Finally,
 Petitioner argues that even if “such instruction was warranted,
 the withholding of such instruction was harmless beyond a
 reasonable doubt in light of Miller.” 
B.
 
As to its second question, Petitioner argues that
 
“there was no evidence adduced that [Complainant] consented to
 enter into a fight or scuffle with [Respondent]” as evidenced by
 (1) Respondent’s testimony that (a) Complainant “was ‘sitting on
 the ground watching a video’ when [Respondent] pushed him[,]” and
 (b) Respondent later punched Complainant “without thinking[,]”
 and (2) the testimony of both Complainant and Cousin that
 Complainant “did not swing the crutch at [Respondent] or take
 aggressive action against him.” 
VI.
 
As recounted, in the instant case, the court
 
specifically refused the parental discipline instruction over
 objection by Respondent based on its finding that there was “no
 
23
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
dispute that the force caused or resulted in substantially [sic] 
bodily injury[.]” “‘[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning[.]’” Kepoo v. Kane, 106 Hawai' i 270, 285, 103 P.3d 939, 954 (2005) 
(quoting Schmidt v. Bd. of Directors of Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Marco Polo Apartments, 73 Haw. 526, 531-32, 836 P.2d 479, 482 (1992)) (ellipsis omitted). 
The language of HRS § 703-309(1)(b) is unambiguous and
 
precludes a defense instruction under that section if “the force
 used [was] [] designed to cause or known to create a risk of
 causing substantial bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or
 mental distress, or neurological damage.” The statute does not
 preclude the defense on the ground that force resulted in
 substantial bodily injury. If the legislature had intended that
 the result of the force used be determinative under HRS
 § 703-309(1)(b), it could have drafted HRS § 703-309(1)(b) to
 reflect that intent. The fact that HRS § 703-309(1)(b) makes no
 mention of a result of substantial bodily injury supports the
 conclusion that the nature of the force is the dispositive factor
 under that subsection.
 
Thus, under HRS § 703-309(1)(b), in some instances,
 
criminal liability will attach to a defendant even though a
 defendant’s use of force did not result in substantial bodily
 
24
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
injury, so long as the force used by the defendant was designed 
to cause or known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury. See Miller 105 Hawai' i at 401, 98 P.3d at 272 (affirming the 
family court’s rejection of the defendant’s parental discipline defense, based in part, on the family court’s finding that although the force used on the minor did not result in any serious injury, “striking the victim about the head did create the risk of causing substantial bodily injury or neurological damage”). Conversely, then, the defense instruction is not precluded if substantial bodily injury results, but the force used was not designed to cause or known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury. Kikuta, 2010 WL 2017646, at *10. 
Based on the foregoing, although acting conscientiously, the court erred in determining that Respondent was precluded from having the jury instructed on the parental discipline defense because the force used against Complainant resulted in substantial bodily injury. The plain language of the statute specifically ties the defense to criminal liability to the nature of the force used as opposed to the result of such use of force. 
VII.
 
A.
 
At trial, Petitioner did not challenge the sufficiency
 
of the evidence adduced by Respondent in support of the elements
 of HRS § 703-309. Rather, as stated, Petitioner argued, and the
 court concluded, that the parental discipline defense was per se
 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
unavailable to a defendant, because substantial bodily injury
 
resulted under HRS § 703-309(1)(b). Petitioner did not advance
 any arguments pertaining to HRS § 703-309(1)(a), as to welfare of
 the Complainant. Thus, any argument based on that subsection has
 been waived. See State v. Rodrigues, 67 Haw. 496, 498, 692 P.2d
 
1156, 1158 (1985) (stating that, “[a]t the trial level, the
 State[] . . . propounded only the theory of consent to the search
 in question” and therefore, “issues of exigency and a ‘good
 faith’ exception [] have been waived”). Implicit in the waiver
 is the well-settled maxim that “the failure to properly raise an
 issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that
 issue on appeal.” State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d
 
1311, 1313 (1990); see also State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 584,
 827 P.2d 648, 655 (1992) (“Our review of the record reveals that
 [the defendant] did not raise this argument at trial, and thus it
 is deemed to have been waived.” (Citing State v. Cummings, 49
 Haw. 522, 423 P.2d 438 (1967).)); Rodgrigues, 67 Haw. at 498, 692
 P.2d at 1158 (holding that the State, “propound[ing] only the
 theory of consent to the search” at the trial level, had waived
 the theories “of exigency and a ‘good faith’ exception” because
 “[i]t is a generally accepted rule that issues not raised at the
 trial level will not be considered on appeal” (citation
 omitted)).
 
26
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. 
Although Petitioner did not argue that Respondent was 
precluded from an instruction on the parental discipline defense 
under HRS § 703-309(1)(a), the ICA dissent and the dissent herein assert that Petitioner was not entitled to a parental discipline defense “because he did not strike [] Complainant for disciplinary reasons.” Dissenting opinion at 3. Like the ICA dissent, the dissent maintains that it may make this determination because “‘an appellate court may affirm the judgment of a trial court on any ground in the record that supports affirmance.’” Id. at 1 n.1 (quoting State v. Fukagawa, 
100 Hawai' i 498, 506, 60 P.3d 899, 907 (2002)) (brackets omitted) 
(emphasis added). The ICA dissent similarly concluded that “[t]he trial evidence did not support a claim that [Respondent’s] use of force was ‘reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor,’ a requirement for the parental discipline defense under HRS § 703-309(1)(a).” Kikuta, 2010 WL 2017646, at *11 (Nakamura, 
C.J., dissenting). Similarly, the dissent argues that “the force used [was] . . . so unreasonable as to take the issue of parental discipline away from the jury.” Dissenting opinion at 5 n.3. But, as discussed, that argument was waived by Petitioner and the court made no determination in that regard. Moreover, where, as here, there is a dispute in the evidence as to what occurred, the determination of liability under HRS § 703-309(1)(a) requires an 
27
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and a weighing of
 
the evidence. Such is not within the province of an appellate
 court, but a function of the fact finder at trial. Consequently,
 in this case, that issue is not to be resolved on appeal, but by
 the jury as the trier of fact. 
Furthermore, we are reviewing a requested instruction 
that was foreclosed from jury consideration by the court. With respect to jury instructions, it is the duty of the trial court to ensure that the jury is properly instructed. State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 335, 141 P.3d 974, 982 (2006); State v. 
Loa, 83 Hawai' i 335, 358, 926 P.2d 1258, 1281 (1996) (stating that 
“the ultimate responsibility properly to instruct the jury lies with the circuit court and not with trial counsel” (quoting State v. Kupau, 76 Hawai' i 387, 395, 879 P.2d 492, 500 (1994))); Haanio, 
94 Hawai' i at 415, 16 P.3d at 256 (stating that “in our judicial 
system, the trial courts, not the parties, have the duty and ultimate responsibility to insure that juries are properly instructed on issues of criminal liability”). Therefore, the foregoing language from Fukugawa is not applicable. However, because the ICA dissent and the dissent address HRS § 703-309(1)(a), although neither raised by Respondent nor considered by the court, we address both HRS § 703-309(1)(a) and (b) in turn.
 
28
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
VIII.
 
It is well-established that a defendant is entitled to 
an instruction on a defense having any support in the evidence, 
no matter how weak, unsatisfactory or inconclusive the evidence might have appeared to the court. Riveira, 59 Haw. at 153, 577 
P.2d at 797 (stating that the defendant was “entitled to have the trier of fact consider a defense having any support in the evidence no matter how weak, inconclusive, or unsatisfactory the evidence involved”); State v. Santiago, 53 Haw. 254, 271, 492 P.2d 657, 667 (1971) (stating that because the defendant’s “testimony fairly raised the issue of self defense[,] . . . he was entitled to an instruction on that issue no matter how weak, unsatisfactory, or inconclusive the testimony might have appeared to the court”); State v. Pavao, 81 Hawai' i 142, 144, 913 P.2d 553, 
555 (App. 1996) (“‘[T]he defendant in a criminal case tried before a jury is entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of defense having any support in the evidence, no matter how weak, inconclusive or unsatisfactory the evidence may be.’” (Quoting State v. Lira, 70 Haw. 23, 29, 759 P.2d 869, 873 (1988). (Brackets in original.)) In other words, here, “the parental discipline defense was available to [Respondent] ‘so long as some evidence was adduced, no matter how weak, inconclusive, or unsatisfactory it might be, which was probative of the aforementioned elements.’” State v. Roman, 119 Hawai' i 468, 478, 
29
         
  
         
             
                 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
199 P.3d 57, 67 (2008) (quoting State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 
95, 976 P.2d 399, 409 (1999)) (brackets and emphasis omitted). 
A.
 
With respect to HRS § 703-309(1)(a), Respondent did
 
adduce some evidence that the force “was employed with due regard
 
for the age and size of the minor and is reasonably related to
 the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the
 minor, including the prevention or punishment of the minor's
 misconduct[.]” Complainant testified at trial that he was
 fourteen at the time of the incident. As of the date of trial,
 he was six-feet tall, but at the time of the incident, he “was a
 couple inches shorter.” He also indicated that he weighed a
 hundred sixty pounds both at the time of trial and at the time of
 the incident.
9
 
Based on Respondent’s description of the force, i.e., a
 
shove to Complainant’s shoulder while “he was off-balance” and
 two punches not aimed at Complainant’s face while one leg was in
 a cast and he was “unable to put any weight on that leg[,]” it
 cannot be concluded as a matter of law that the degree of force
 employed against Complainant was excessive for the age and size
 of the minor. Because “the permissible degree of force []
 var[ies] according to the child's physique and age, the
 misconduct of the child, the nature of the discipline, and all
 
9
 As indicated before, it is unclear exactly how much Respondent
 
weighed at the time of the incident, although he asserted in his opening brief
that he weighed between 185 and 190 pounds at that time. See supra note 7.
 
30
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the surrounding circumstances[,]” that determination must be made 
by the jury. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 165, 166 P.3d at 338. 
B.
 
Additionally, there was some evidence under HRS § 703­
309(1)(a) that the force was used for the purpose of the
 prevention of, or punishment for, Complainant’s misconduct. As
 recounted, Respondent testified at trial that he was a “father
 figure” to Complainant and “cared about him[,]” “loved him” and
 “provided for him.” On occasion, Respondent would need to
 discipline Complainant and “expect[ed Complainant] to listen to
 [him].” Respondent related that after he struck Complainant he
 talked to him calmly and stated, “[W]hat makes you think you
 could stand up to dad, you know. Don’t do that, you know.” 
Although Respondent did not expressly state that he had used
 force for the purpose of disciplining Complainant or to promote
 his welfare, it can be reasonably inferred from the
 circumstances. 
In Roman, the defendant was charged and convicted for 
abusing the seventeen-year-old son of his girlfriend (the minor). 119 Hawai' i at 469, 199 P.3d at 58. The minor testified that the 
defendant kicked him in his “lower back” and “whacked [him a] couple times” in the face “with his hand[,]” after the minor had ignored the defendant’s request for the minor to help him prepare a Mother’s Day dinner. Id. at 470, 199 P.3d at 59. The family 
court concluded, inter alia, that “‘discipline is to correct 
31
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
misbehavior” and the use of force was not to “‘correct[]
 
misbehavior but . . . to take control of the situation where [the
 defendant was] not having cooperation.’” Id. at 476, 199 P.3d at
 
65 (emphasis omitted). 
This court found the foregoing conclusion “curious[]”
 
since the family court had described the minor as a “‘defiant
 child,’ based on [the m]inor’s ‘standing up’ and ‘staring’ at
 [the defendant] with ‘his fists clenched,’” and had also noted
 that conduct in slapping Minor was a “reaction to the boy's
 defiance.” Id. at 480, 199 P.3d at 69 (brackets omitted). It
 
was explained by this court that “[c]haracterizing [the m]inor as
 being defiant but, at the same time, characterizing [the m]inor’s
 behavior toward [the defendant] as simply demonstrating a lack of
 cooperation defies logic.” Id. In this court’s view, not
 
cooperating with a defiant attitude and demeanor is
 “misbehavior,” i.e., misconduct, on the part of [the m]inor as
 such behavior shows disrespect for parental authority.” Id. 
According to the Roman court, “it seem[ed] natural that [the
 defendant], as one of the persons responsible for the general
 care and supervision of [the m]inor, would view [the m]inor’s
 attitude and demeanor as misconduct that warranted discipline.” 
Id.
 
In the instant case, as Complainant’s step-father,
 
Respondent was likewise responsible for Complainant’s welfare, 
32
         
       
         
          
        
         
       
        
       
       
          
        
       
          
        
            
        
       
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
supervision, and general care. Based on Respondent’s testimony
 
of Complainant’s acts of (1) slamming the glass door despite
 Respondent’s warning not to do so, (2) ignoring Respondent when
 Respondent attempted to talk to Complainant about such behavior,
 and (3) swinging a crutch at Respondent, the jury could have
 found that it would be “natural” for Respondent, “as one of the
 persons responsible for the general care and supervision of
 [Complainant], to view [Complainant’s acts] as misconduct that
 warranted discipline.” Id. Moreover, as in Roman, Respondent in
 
fact stated that he had struck Complainant as “a reaction to what
 had just happened.” 
This court has acknowledged on another occasion that
 
the fact that the use of force may have arisen out of anger or
 short temper, does not automatically mean that such force was not
 reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting
 the welfare of the minor, or for the prevention or punishment of
 misconduct. In Matavale, this court explained that
 
[the] protection for parents [afforded by the parental
discipline defense] should exist even if the parent acts out
of frustration or short temper . Parents do not always act
with calmness of mind or considered judgment when upset
with, or concerned about, their children’s behavior. Nor do
 parents always act pursuant to a clearly defined
circumstance of discipline or control. A reaction often
 
occurs from behavior a parent deems inappropriate that
irritates or angers the parent, causing a reactive,
demonstrative act. Heat of the moment must not result in
 
immoderate physical force and must be managed; however, an
angry moment driving moderate or reasonable discipline is
often part and parcel of the real world of parenting with
which prosecutors and courts should not interfere. What
 
parent among us can say he or she has not been angered to
some degree from a child's defiant, impudent, or insolent
conduct, sufficient to call for spontaneous, stern, and
meaningful discipline?

Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 166, 166 P.3d at 339 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted) (some emphases in original, some 
added). 
The dissent maintains that any suggestion that parental 
discipline can occur reflexively or out of anger “is not persuasive [here],” because “this court has held that ‘heat of the moment must not result in immoderate physical force and must be managed[.]’” Dissenting opinion at 3 (quoting Matavale, 115 Hawai'i at 166, 166 P.3d at 339) (emphasis omitted). According to 
the dissent, because this court has not approved of two punches to a minor’s face resulting in a broken nose and chipped teeth for parental discipline, Petitioner’s “use of force therefore was not moderate or ‘reasonably related’ to the Complainant’s welfare.” Id. at 4-5. 
Preliminarily, it must be made clear that our holding
 
today does not “approve,” as the dissent suggests, of the type of
 force used by Respondent or of the resulting injuries to
 Complainant. Here, we must decide only whether the defense
 should have at least been considered by the jury; not whether
 Petitioner’s use of force was ultimately justified under the 
defense. We hold only that there was at least some evidence in
 the record supporting an instruction on the defense. 
Furthermore, even under the dissent’s citation to Matavele, “the
 question of reasonableness or excessiveness of physical
 punishment given a child by a parent is determined on a
 
34
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
case-by-case basis and is dependent upon the particular 
circumstances of the case.” Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 165, 166 
P.3d at 338 (emphasis added). “[T]here is no bright line that dictates what, under all circumstances, is unreasonable or excessive corporal punishment. . . . [T]he permissible degree of force will vary according to the child’s physique and age, the misconduct of the child, the nature of the discipline, and all the surrounding circumstances.” Id. 
In a jury trial, whether the force employed by the
 
defendant was “immoderate” or excessive is to be determined by
 the jury as the trier of fact. Where a defendant asserts the
 parental discipline defense in a jury trial, the court’s duty is
 to consider whether the defendant has raised any evidence
 supporting the instruction, not to determine whether such a
 defense has merit -- that is for the jury to decide. In a jury
 trial, where the evidence is disputed, the foregoing question
 must be answered by the jury. Obviously, here, the evidence was
 in dispute. 
IX.
 
A.
 
With respect to HRS § 703-309(1)(b), Respondent did
 
adduce some evidence to support the two prongs set forth under
 that section. As to the first prong, regarding whether the force
 used was designed to cause substantial bodily injury, Respondent
 admitted that he had pushed Complainant on the shoulders with two
 
35
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
hands while he was “off-balance” and therefore, “harder than [he]
 
wanted to[.]” He had additionally testified that at the time of
 the incident, his leg was in a cast and he was “unable to put any
 weight on that leg.” Respondent related that when he pushed
 Complainant, his crutches “fell down.” Thus, Respondent was
 apparently without the assistance of his crutches when
 Complainant got up off the floor and, according to Respondent,
 swung a crutch at him. Respondent then hit Complainant two times
 “to try to make him let go of [the] crutch.” Respondent further
 indicated that he was not aiming for Complainant’s face, but just
 “reacted” and did not have time to think. 
As described by Respondent, there was some evidence
 
that the force used was not designed to cause substantial bodily
 injury, inasmuch as Respondent testified that he was unable to
 place any weight on the leg that was in a cast, hit Complainant
 as a reaction to Complainant swinging a crutch at him, and was
 not aiming for Complainant’s face. See State v. Kaimimoku, 9
 
Haw. App. 345, 347, 841 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1992) (holding that,
 where the minor had testified that the defendant had “with an
 ‘open fist slapped her on her face’ and ‘whacked’ her on her face
 ‘with an open fist straight on and on the right side of her
 face’” and “punched her on her shoulders with a ‘closed fist,’”
 the prosecution “did not satisfy its burden of disproving [the
 defendant’s parental discipline] defense”).
 
36
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
To conclude that Respondent struck Complainant with a 
design of causing substantial bodily injury would require this 
court to determine the credibility of the witnesses and weigh the disputed evidence presented at trial. However, those matters are within the sole province of the jury as the trier of fact. See 
State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai' i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996) 
(“In a jury trial, the jury is the trier of fact and, thus, is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.”) (Citing State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637-38, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981)). In deciding whether a defendant is entitled to an instruction on the parental discipline defense, the court must determine whether there was any evidence to support the defense, no matter how weak, unsatisfactory, or inconclusive that evidence may be. Because on appeal, we “will not attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence,” State v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. 448, 457, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), we cannot conclude as a matter of law that under the circumstances the force used by Respondent was designed to cause substantial bodily injury. 
B.
 
With respect to the second prong of HRS
 
§ 703-309(1)(b), regarding whether the force used was known to
 cause a risk of substantial bodily injury, again, the force used,
 under the circumstances described by Respondent, cannot be said
 
37
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to be of the nature and type of force that would necessarily be 
known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury as a matter of law. Whether or not two punches in this case creates a risk of substantial bodily injury requires consideration of the facts and circumstances. Such determination is something that requires “the fact finder [to] consider the child's age, the child's stature, and the nature of the injuries inflicted[.]” Matavale, 
115 Hawai' i at 164, 166 P.3d at 337. Additionally, to reiterate, 
the permissible degree of force varies depending on all of the surrounding circumstances and is determined on a case-by-case basis. Id. at 165, 166 P.3d at 338. 
In this case, for example, had the jury been instructed
 
properly, it would be free to consider Respondent’s testimony
 that (1) he reacted to Complainant swinging the crutch at him,
 (2) one of his legs was in a cast, (3) he could not place any
 weight on that leg, (4) he was without crutches, and (5) he was
 not aiming at Complainant’s face. A jury may have concluded that
 under those circumstances, the force used by Petitioner was not
 of a nature known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury. 
Because of the disputed evidence, that determination was to be
 made by the jury; not by the court. In sum, because there was
 some evidence indicating that under the circumstances, the force
 used was not designed to cause or known to create a risk of
 substantial bodily injury, Respondent was entitled to have the 
38
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
parental discipline defense instruction given to the jury for it
 
to make that determination.
 
X.
 
The occasions upon which this court and the ICA have 
addressed the parental discipline defense have considered whether the prosecution had met its burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See e.g. Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 11, 
911 P.2d at 731 (stating that “the prosecution had the burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt the justification evidence that was adduced, or proving beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the justification defense”). Most of those cases involved bench, i.e., non-jury trials, and therefore, the trial court acted as the trier of fact as well as the judge of the law. In these cases the parental discipline defense was considered by the trial courts and we properly reviewed all of the evidence considered by the trial court in order to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the trial court’s judgment of conviction despite the parental discipline defense. See, e.g., 
Tanielu, 82 Hawai' i at 378, 922 P.2d at 991 (stating that “[i]n 
determining whether to uphold the family court’s decision,” “the test is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
39
         
 
        
           
            
            
              
             
            
            
          
             
           
            
          
            
            
        
       
           
             
           
             
          
             
            
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conclusion of [the court as] the trier of fact”) (internal
 
quotation marks and citation omitted).10
 
Contrastingly, the instant case was a jury trial in
 
which the parental discipline defense instruction was not given
 and, thus, not considered by the trier of fact. As said before,
 in denying the instruction, the court foreclosed the fact finder,
 in this case the jury, from considering evidence of such a
 defense. As noted previously, where the evidence is disputed and
 there is any evidence to support the defense, the instruction
 must be given by the trial court in order to allow the jury to
 consider the defense. Additionally, to reiterate, on appeal it
 is not for the appellate court to reconcile conflicting evidence
 as to that defense; that is a function for the fact finder at
 trial. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. at 457, 877 P.2d at 895 (stating
 
10 Briefly noted, Petitioner argued that, in Miller, the ICA 
determined that strikes to the head creates a risk of causing substantial
bodily injury. In Miller, the family court had concluded that “striking the
victim about the head did create the risk of causing substantial bodily injuryor neurological damage.” 105 Hawai 'i at 399, 98 P.3d at 270. The ICA 
explained, “While we may not agree with all of the purported principles of lawpromulgated by the family court in announcing its verdict, we need not ponderthem all, for we conclude there was substantial evidence in any event tonegate [the defendant’s parental discipline] defense.” Id. at 399-400, 98 
P.3d 265, 270-71. Miller did not ipso facto establish in all cases that
striking a complainant on the head creates a risk of causing substantialbodily injury so as to defeat the parental discipline defense. Rather, Miller
concluded that there was substantial evidence adduced to support the familycourt’s conclusion that the force used by the defendant in that case was
“‘known to create a risk of causing substantial bodily injury[.]’” Id. at 
402, 98 P.3d at 273 (quoting HRS § 703-309(1)(b)).
Petitioner apparently suggests that the court’s failure to
instruct the jury on the parental discipline defense was harmless because nojuror would have concluded that the force used by Respondent did not create arisk of causing substantial bodily injury. However, as recounted, there wasconflicting testimony in the instant case and “[i]t is for the . . .fact-finder to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve allquestions of fact[.]” Id. at 400, 98 P.3d at 271 (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted). Moreover, each case is to be judged on its “circumstances.” See Matavele , 115 Hawai 'i at 165, 166 P.3d at 338.

that “on appeal, this court will not attempt to reconcile
 
conflicting evidence”) (brackets, ellipsis, internal quotation
 marks, and citations omitted). 
As elucidated, there was some evidence adduced in this
 
case supporting each element of the parental discipline defense. 
Because we cannot know how a jury would have resolved conflicting
 evidence regarding the defense, there is a reasonable possibility
 that the court’s error “might have contributed to [Respondent’s]
 conviction such that the error cannot be said to be harmless
 beyond a reasonable doubt.” Roman, 119 Hawai' i at 482, 199 P.3d 
at 71-72.

As stated, Petitioner argues in its Application, that
 
the ICA erred in failing to conclude that the court “did not
 
11 We disagree with the dissent’s assertion that the error in this
 
case is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See dissenting opinion at 5-6.
The dissent suggests that the force used in this case was “excessive” compared
 
to the force used in Roman. Id. at 7. With all due respect, the dissent
assumes the role of the trier of fact in this case, deciding whether, under
the controverted evidence, Petitioner should prevail on the merits of the
parental discipline defense. As stated before, we determine only whether
there was any evidence in the record supporting an instruction on the defense.
Having determined that there is, it is the jury’s duty to decide whether the
force used by Petitioner was too “excessive” under the circumstances. As
 observed before, because we should not weigh the merits of the defense in this
case, and further, cannot know how the jury would have ruled thereon had it
been properly instructed, the error cannot be said to be harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt.
 
The dissent challenges the foregoing, asserting that in some cases
the force used against a minor is “so unreasonable as to take the issue of the
 parental discipline defense away from the jury.” Dissenting opinion at 5 n.3.
The example posited by the dissent is where a parent shoots a minor. In such
 a case, the court would conclude as a matter of law, that the defendant would
not be entitled to the parental discipline defense. Clearly, the force used
in this case was not similar to the shooting of a minor. To reiterate, in
contrast to the foregoing example, it cannot be concluded that the nature of
the force used by Petitioner was excessive or unreasonable as a matter of law
in light of the disputed evidence.
 
41
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
commit plain error in failing to give a mutual affray instruction 
with respect to the lesser included offense of Assault in the Third Degree[.]” “‘As a general rule, jury instructions to which no objection has been made at trial will be reviewed only for plain error.’” An error will be deemed plain error “‘[i]f the substantial rights of the defendant have been affected adversely[.]’” Additionally, “‘this [c]ourt will apply the plain error standard of review to correct errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights.’” Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 334, 141 
P.3d at 981 (quoting State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 325, 330, 966 
P.2d 637, 642 (1998)) (internal citations omitted). Hawai' i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b) additionally provides that “[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.” 
As was explained in Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 334, 141 
P.3d at 981, this court has affirmed the use of the plain error standard of review for erroneous jury instructions. Nichols 
explained that in State v. Eberly, 107 Hawai' i 239, 112 P.3d 725 
(2005), this court observed that “erroneous [jury] instructions may be grounds for reversal despite counsel's failure to object at trial” because “it is ultimately the trial court that is responsible for ensuring that the jury is properly instructed.” 
42
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 335, 141 P.3d at 982. As described in 
Nichols, because it is the duty of the trial court to properly 
instruct the jury on the law, although “as a general matter forfeited assignments of error are to be reviewed under the HRPP Rule 52(b) plain error standard of review,” “in the case of erroneous jury instructions, that standard of review is effectively merged with the HRPP Rule 52(a) harmless error standard of review because it is the duty of the trial court to properly instruct the jury.” Id. at 337, 141 P.3d at 984; see 
also State v. Holbron, 78 Hawai' i 422, 428, 895 P.2d 173, 179 
(App. 1995) (“[I]t is the duty of the trial judge to give appropriate instructions even if not requested by counsel.”). It was thus explained that “once instructional error is demonstrated,” this court “will vacate [the judgment of the court], without regard to whether timely objection was made, if there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the defendant's conviction, i.e., that the erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. 
B.
 
As recounted, Petitioner argued on appeal that even if
 
Respondent was entitled to an instruction on mutual affray, such
 error was harmless, because the court’s failure to give an
 instruction on a lesser included offense “‘is harmless when the
 jury convicts the defendant of the charged offense or of an
 included offense greater than the included offense erroneously
 
43
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
omitted from the instructions[.]’” (Quoting Haanio, 94 Hawai' i at 
415-16, 16 P.3d at 256-57.) However, mutual affray, HRS § 707­
712(2), is not a lesser included offense of Assault in the Third Degree, but rather, a mitigating defense to Misdemeanor Assault in the Third Degree. 
HRS § 701-115(1) (1993) provides in relevant part that
 
“[a] defense is a fact or set of facts which negatives penal
 liability.” (Emphasis added.) HRS § 707-712(1) sets forth the
 offense of Assault in the Third Degree. HRS § 707-712(2)
 provides that Assault in the Third Degree will generally be a
 “misdemeanor unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into
 by mutual consent,” in which case, it is “a petty misdemeanor.” 
The commentary on HRS § 707-12 similarly explains that “Assault
 in the third degree . . . is treated as a misdemeanor[,]” but “is
 reduced to a petty misdemeanor if the harm is inflicted in a
 fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.” (Emphasis
 added.) Thus, HRS § 707-712(2) “provide[s] a defense which
 mitigates that crime from a misdemeanor to a petty misdemeanor
 when the assault is committed during a fight or scuffle entered
 into by mutual consent.” State v. Coyle, 71 Haw. 165, 167, 785
 
P.2d 1320, 1320 (1990) (emphasis added). In other words, mutual
 affray is a mitigating defense that reduces the offense of
 Assault in the Third Degree to a petty misdemeanor. Cf. State v.
 
Pinero, 70 Haw. 509, 523-24, 778 P.2d 704, 714 (1989)
 (distinguishing the lesser-included offense of “Manslaughter”
 
44
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under HRS § 707-702(1)(a), that includes the same elements of
 
murder except for a different state of mind, i.e. recklessly,
 from the “mitigating defense,” HRS § 707-702(2), under which the
 “intentional [or knowing] killing of another while under the
 influence of a reasonably induced [extreme mental or] emotional
 disturbance” reduces murder to manslaughter (brackets in
 original)); see also HRS § 707-720 (Supp. 2008) (“In a
 prosecution for kidnapping, it is a defense which reduces the
 offense to a class B felony that the defendant voluntarily
 released the victim, alive and not suffering from serious or
 substantial bodily injury, in a safe place prior to trial.”) 
(Emphasis added.)
 
It may be noted that Respondent was charged with 
Assault in the Third Degree. Hawai' i Jury Instructions Criminal 
(HAWJIC) 9.21 relating to mutual affray Assault in the Third Degree states that “[w]hen an Assault in the Third Degree instruction is submitted to the jury, the court must also submit a mutual affray instruction and special interrogatory where there is any evidence that the fight or scuffle was entered into by mutual consent.” (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we hold that the court must submit a mutual affray instruction to the jury where there is any evidence in the record that the injury was

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
inflicted during the course of a fight or scuffle entered into by
 
mutual consent, as indicated in HAWJIC 9.21.12
 
C.
 
In the instant case, there was some evidence adduced 
that the injury to Complainant occurred in the course of a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent. The term “mutual consent” is not defined by statute and has not been defined by case law. We may “‘[r]esort to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one way to determine the ordinary meaning of certain terms [not statutorily defined].’” State v. Kalama, 94 
Hawai'i 60, 63 n.6, 8 P.3d 1224, 1227 n.6 (2000) (quoting State v. 
Chen, 77 Hawai' i 329, 337, 884 P.2d 392, 400 (App. 1994)) 
(brackets in original). The term “mutual” is defined as, inter alia, “reciprocal” or “belonging to two parties[.]” Black’s Law 
Dictionary 1115 (9th ed. 2009). The definition of the term “consent” includes “[a]greement, approval or permission as to some act[.]” Id. at 346. Consent may be express, but may also 
be implied, defined as “[c]onsent inferred from one’s conduct rather than from one’s direct expression.” Id.; see also State 
v. Hanson, 97 Hawai' i 71, 75, 34 P.3d 1, 5 (2001) (“Consent may 
also be implied ‘from an individual's words, gestures, or conduct.’” (Quoting United States v. Buettner-Janusch, 646 F.2d 
12
 “The introduction to the HAWJIC indicates that ‘[n]othing herein 
contained shall be construed as an approval by the Supreme Court of the State
of Hawaii . . . of the substance of any of said instructions.” State v. Toro ,
77 Hawai 'i 340, 348, 884 P.2d 403, 411 (App. 1994) (brackets in original). We 
nevertheless find HAWJIC’s recommendation prudent in light of the foregoingdiscussion. 
46
         
          
            
         
              
         
            
       
            
              
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
759, 764 (2d Cir. 1981).)). A plain reading of HRS § 707-702(2),
 
then, denotes that mutual affray requires both parties to have
 approved of, or agreed to, a fight or scuffle, whether expressly
 or by conduct.
 
In this case, although Complainant testified that he
 
did not give Respondent permission to punch him, there was some
 evidence adduced from which Complainant’s consent to affray may
 be implied. As recounted, Respondent testified that he pushed
 Complainant on the shoulders, while Complainant was sitting on
 the floor, after being ignored several times. Respondent
 testified that after his crutches fell from under his arms,
 Complainant picked up one and swung the crutch at him. It was at
 that time that Respondent hit Complainant. Complainant conceded
 on cross-examination that “when [he] stood up with [the] crutch,
 . . . [he] figured that [Respondent] thought [he was] going to
 whack him with it.” 
Respondent’s testimony that Complainant had swung the
 
crutch at him is evidence from which it could be implied that,
 from that point, Complainant had impliedly consented to a fight
 or scuffle with Respondent.
13 Inasmuch as the testimony of

 The dissent asserts that an instruction on mutual affray “was not
 
supported by the evidence[.]” Dissenting opinion at 7. According to the
dissent, Complainant and Cousin testified that Petitioner was the aggressor
and Complainant did not agree to enter into a fight with Respondent. Id. at
 
8. First, the dissent disregards Respondent’s testimony that Complainant
picked up a crutch and swung it at him. Respectfully, in seeminglydiscrediting Respondent’s testimony, the dissent determines credibility andweighs the evidence, something that is not within the province of an appellatecourt. State v. Eastman , 81 Hawai 'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996) (“An

           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Complainant and Respondent differ, it is not for this court to 
determine whether the testimony of one was more credible than the other. See supra. Because there was some evidence in the record 
as to that issue, the jury should have been instructed on mutual affray. See HAWJIC 9.21. Inasmuch as “it is the duty of the 
trial court to properly instruct the jury[,]” the judgment of conviction must be vacated, “without regard to whether timely objection was made,” because “there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed to [Respondent’s] conviction” for misdemeanor assault in the third degree. Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 
337, 141 P.3d at 984. 
D.
 
With all due respect, the dissent is incorrect that
 
“trial courts will be obligated to instruct the jury sua sponte
 on mutual affray even though that defense may have little or no
 application to the facts of the case.” Dissenting opinion at 12;
 see also id. at 12 n.6. We are not suggesting, as the dissent
 asserts, that a court has an obligation to instruct the jury sua
 sponte on all available defenses. Rather, it is well established
 that a court must only instruct the jury on defenses which have
 
13(...continued)
t
he credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because this is
the province of the trial judge.”) Additionally, it would appear that the
dissent would require an express statement by Complainant or Cousin that
Complainant agreed to engage in a fight with Respondent. The dissent sets out
 several examples of when mutual consent to fight could be implied, see
dissenting opinion at 9, such as “gesturing to leave a bar, ‘throwing down the
 gauntlet’ [or] clearing the bench at a baseball game,” id. In the same light,
it can be inferred from Complainant’s conduct of swinging the crutch at
Respondent, that he impliedly consented to a fight or scuffle with Respondent.
But whether this was in fact the case was for the jury.

support in the record, although that evidence may be “weak,
 
inconclusive, or unsatisfactory[.]” Riveira, 59 Haw. at 153, 577
 
P.2d at 797.14 Moreover, in this particular case, we only confirm
 
what already exists, for HAWJIC 9.21 declares that the court must
 give a mutual affray instruction when instructing on Assault in
 the Third Degree. Accordingly, we see no problem, as the dissent
 does, with requiring an instruction on mutual affray where the
 jury is instructed on Assault in the Third Degree. See
 
dissenting opinion at 12 n.6. Furthermore, because there is at
 least some evidence in the record supporting such an instruction,
 HAWJIC 9.21 applies, and because this case will be retried, there
 
14 According to the dissent, State v. Stenger , 122 Hawai 'i 271, 226 
P.3d 441 (2010), which held that the court erred in failing to sua sponte
instruct the jury on the mistake of fact defense when the defendant requested
a claim of right instruction, id. at 276, 282, 226 P.3d at 446, 452, was
“limited” by the concurring opinion which noted that the defense theory atissue in Stenger “formed the very heart of the defense case, rather than some
nebulous, barely glimpsed theory on the margins[,]” id. at 297, 226 P.3d at 
467 (Kim, J., concurring). Dissenting opinion at 10-12; 11 n.5. First, we note that Judge Kim also signed the opinion of the court.
Second, the dissent’s view of Stenger would have to be justified
under the doctrine set forth in Marks v. United States , 430 U.S. 188, 193
(1977), also known as the “narrowest grounds” doctrine, under which the
 holding of a plurality opinion “may be viewed as that position taken by those
Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.” However,
 that doctrine has been discredited. See, e.g. , Adam S. Hochschild, The Modern
Problem of Supreme Court Plurality Decisions: Interpretation in Historical
Perspective , 4 Wash. U. J.L. & Pol’y 261, 281 (2000) (stating that even
“[a]ccording to the [Court in Nichols v. United States , 511 U.S. 738 (1994)],
the narrowest grounds test proved easier to state than to apply”); Joseph M.
Cacace, Plurality Decisions in the Supreme Court of the United States: A
 Reexamination of the Marks Doctrine After Rapanos v. United States , 41 Suffolk
U. L. Rev. 97, 101 (2007) (describing the two main “competing approaches” to
 
applying the doctrine); Mark Alan Thurmon, When the Court Divides:
Reconsidering the Precedential Value of Supreme Court Plurality Decisions , 42
Duke L.J. 419, 429 (1992) (stating that neither of the two main justifications
for the Marks doctrine provides a supportable basis for it and that the Marks
court “misconstrued prior precedent and inadequately considered the
problematic nature of plurality decisions”). More importantly, the doctrine
has been applied very rarely and inconsistently by the Supreme Court. See,
e.g., Nichols , 511 U.S. at 745 (“We think it not useful to pursue the Marks
inquiry to the utmost logical possibility when it has so obviously baffled and
divided the lower courts that have considered it.”).

is no reason why the jury should not be instructed on that
 
defense.

Therefore, the October 1, 2008 Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed by the court is vacated. The ICA’s June 8,
 2010 judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part and the
 case remanded for retrial on the grounds set forth herein.
