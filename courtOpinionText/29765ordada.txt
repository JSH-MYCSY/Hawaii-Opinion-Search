IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
CLAYTON FRANK, DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY,
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 08-1-0869)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s
January 27, 2010 “motion for release of prisoner pending
disposition of application for habeas corpus,” it appears that
petitioner’s April 15, 2009 petition for a writ of habeas corpus
is not pending before the supreme court in the instant case
inasmuch as the petition was disposed by the April 22, 2009 order
denying the petition without prejudice to seeking habeas corpus
relief in the circuit court.  The fact that petitioner
subsequently sought and was denied habeas corpus relief in the
circuit court did not reinstate petitioner’s April 15, 2009
petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the instant case. 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the “motion for release of
prisoner pending disposition of application for habeas corpus” is
dismissed.  The dismissal is without prejudice to seeking release
pending appeal from the circuit court in Cr. No. 08-1-0869 and 2from the intermediate court of appeals in No. 29993 pursuant to
HRAP 9(b).
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 1, 2010.
