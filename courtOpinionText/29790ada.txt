CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0418(3))

ACOBA, DUFFY, JJ., AND CIRCUIT JUDGE SAKAMOTO, ASSIGNED
DUE TO A VACANCY; WITH RECKTENWALD, C.J., CONCURRING
IN THE RESULT, WITH WHOM NAKAYAMA, J., JOINS 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that (1) in the criminal trial of a defendant,
 
the prosecution’s statements that a testifying defendant
 
“benefitted” from his trial presence and, thus, is less credible
 because he heard the testimony of other witnesses and heard
 during voir dire that eye contact with the jurors was an
 indicator of trustworthiness, constitute prohibited “generic
 tailoring” arguments; (2) prohibited generic tailoring arguments
         
         
            
     
     
         
             
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
are reviewable as plain error inasmuch as they affect a
 
defendant’s substantial constitutional rights; (3) standard jury
 instructions regarding witness testimony and counsel’s arguments
 do not cure such improper arguments; (4) accordingly, whenever a
 defendant testifies, the jury must be instructed that the
 defendant has a right to be present during trial; and (5) in this
 case the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Based
 on the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the June 10, 2010
 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed
 
1
 pursuant to its May 26, 2010 published opinion vacating the
March 31, 2009 judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second

Circuit (the court)  adjudging Respondent/Defendant-AppellantTimothy A. Walsh (Respondent) guilty of Assault in the Second Degree, Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-711(1)(b) (Supp.

2008),  see State v. Walsh, 123 Hawai' i 284, 231 P.3d 1001 (App. 
2010), and remand the case for a new trial, consistent with this opinion.

On May 31, 2008, two groups of people were involved in
 
an altercation outside of an all-in-one restaurant, sports bar,

and nightclub called “Oceans Beach Bar and Grille” (the bar) in
 
Kukui Mall in Kihei, Maui. One group consisted of Respondent,
 his sister Stephanie Walsh (Stephanie), and friends Lucy Mapson
 (Lucy) and Ilia Pikaki (Ilia). The other group consisted of
 Kapena Kramer (Kapena), his brother Iopeka Kramer (Kepa), their
 friend Donald, known as Kala, and other men who were celebrating
 Kepa’s upcoming wedding. Both groups had been drinking alcoholic
 beverages. Respondent argued with Kala, and Ilia became involved
 in a fight with Kepa. Kapena attempted to stop the conflict
 between Ilia and Kepa. At some point, Respondent punched Kapena
 in the jaw. 
A. 
Respondent was present throughout the trial, including
 
voir dire during jury selection.
4 Respondent, Stephanie, Lucy,5
 
Kapena, Kepa, two police officers, and John Cooprider, the
 general manager of the bar, among others, testified at trial. 
Respondent testified last. The following relevant matters, some
 verbatim, are adduced from the testimony of witnesses at trial as
 indicated.

 A  transcript  of  the  voir  dire  proceedings  is  not  part  of  the
 
record.   Voir  dire  is  a  “preliminary  examination  of  a  prospective  juror  by  a
judge  or  lawyer  to  decide  whether  the  prospect  is  qualified  and  suitable  to
serve  on  a  jury.”   Black’s  Law  Dictionary  1710  (9th  ed.  2009).

 Because  Lucy  and  Stephanie  testified  to  a  similar  version  of  the
 
events,  their  testimony  are  discussed  together.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1. Lucy Lei Mapson and Stephanie Marie Walsh
 
On the evening in question, Stephanie and Lucy arrived
 
at the bar at approximately 11:30 p.m. They left the bar when it
 
closed, met Respondent and Ilia, and together they headed towards
 Lucy’s car, which was parked near Paradise Photo. On the way to
 Lucy’s car, which was parked in front of the photo shop,
 Stephanie argued with Respondent. They stopped when males parked
 in the row behind them started yelling at them. According to
 Stephanie, Kala “told [Respondent] to shut the F up[,]” and
 Respondent replied, “[M]ind [your] own business[,]” to which Kala
 responded, “[S]hut the F up you stupid haole[.]”
6 The males
 
walked towards Respondent, Stephanie, Lucy, and Ilia. 
According to Lucy, Kala, who was “angry [and] pumped
 
up,” and Respondent then stood “[f]ace to face[]” and yelled at
 each other. Five men attacked Respondent. To defend himself,
 Respondent “[t]hrew [a] couple [of] punches[]” but was backed
 into a corner. Stephanie was with Respondent and sought to
 prevent the men from striking him. According to Stephanie, the
 men took Respondent into a corner and “[p]unched and kicked and
 stomped on[]” Respondent “30 times[,]” and, as a result,
 Respondent had “bumps on his face[,]” “big lumps” on “the back of
 his head” and a “black and blue[]” mouth. Respondent “curled up
 in a ball” about 15 feet from the car. He was punched and kicked
 for three or four minutes. No security guard became involved.

 “Haole”  is  a  Hawaiian  word  for  a  white  person  or  “Caucasian.”

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
At some point, four men approached Ilia and started
 
attacking him. Lucy attempted to prevent them from doing so, but
 
she was hit in the face and fell to the ground. According to
 Lucy, the fight between Ilia and the men seemed to last for five
 minutes. 
After the confrontation between Ilia and the other men
 
had tapered off, Respondent escaped from the corner and was in
 the parking lot near Lucy’s car. He was still being punched. At
 some point, Respondent “slipped out,” “ducked under[,] and moved
 away[,]” to where he was steps away from Ilia and a male who was
 yelling at Ilia and using his hands to explain a point. 
Respondent came up to the male, apparently Kapena, and struck
 Kapena. The male fell and hit Lucy’s car. At the time Kapena
 was struck, other men were continuing to brawl. Lucy did not see
 any “bouncers” or security guards in the parking lot during the
 altercation. 
Respondent fled and one of the bouncers from the bar
 
held him on the ground. The police arrested Respondent, who,
 according to Lucy, had blood on his mouth and whose “head was
 lumped up pretty bad.” 
2.	 Kapena Jonah Kramer 
According to Kapena, he, Kepa, Kala, and another
 
7
friend drank at the bar, left the bar when it closed, and headed
toward their vehicles in the parking lot. By that time, Kapena
 
7
 Kapena  stated  that  approximately  ten  friends  had  been  at  the  bar
 
to  celebrate  Kepa’s  bachelor  party.
   
5
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
was intoxicated, as he had imbibed tequila and eight to nine
 
beers throughout the night. Kala had a “verbal confrontation”
 with Respondent, who initially was with two females, near the
 corner of the photo shop. Kala and Respondent fought and
 wrestled for about five minutes. No staff or security guards
 became involved. 
At the time Respondent and Kala began to clash, Kala
 
was ten to fifteen yards away from Kapena. Shortly after Kala
 and Respondent began to fight, Kepa, who was standing next to
 Kapena, became involved in a confrontation with Ilia. This
 confrontation occurred at the corner of Paradise Photo. Kepa and
 Ilia fought for about thirty seconds before Kapena stepped in and
 stopped Kepa from continuing. Kapena recalled that he attempted
 to calm his brother and Ilia. At that point Kapena had his hands
 up, indicating that the conflict had ended. Kapena did not
 recall the location of the females. The next thing Kapena
 remembered, he was “waking up lying on the ground” near the
 corner of the photo shop. 
3. Kepa Kramer
 Kepa was intoxicated due to his consumption of beers,
 
whiskey, and tequila. When he, Kapena, Kala, and another friend
 left the bar and headed toward the vehicle in the parking lot,
 Kepa saw a male and a female arguing. Kepa did not see any
 security guards or staff near the male and female. One of Kepa’s
 friends asked Respondent, “[W]hy do you have to pick on a girl?” 
6
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8
Kepa saw Kala argue and fight  with Respondent.  Kepa and Ilia
 
began to fight. The altercation between Kepa and Ilia started in
 the parking lot, and ended on the sidewalk near the corner of the
 photo shop. Someone pulled Kepa away, and “it was done.” 
According to Kepa, at that point, no other clashes were
 
occurring. 
Kepa had begun to walk to his vehicle when Kapena was
 
struck. Kepa did not see what happened but saw Kapena on the
 ground. 
Kepa chased Respondent and hit him in the face and head. 
4. Respondent 
Respondent and Ilia met Stephanie and Lucy outside the
 
bar. Respondent, Stephanie, Lucy, and Ilia walked to the car, at
 which time Respondent argued with Stephanie. When Respondent was
 in front of Lucy’s car, “some guys across the street started
 yelling[,]” and Respondent “told them to mind their own
 business[,]” to which one of the men responded, “[S]hut the F up,
 you stupid haole.” 
The men approached, and Kala started arguing with
 
Respondent, who put up his hands because he believed Kala was
 going to attack him. Respondent initially was in front of Lucy’s
 car. He was punched and “everything kind of went black.” 
Respondent “tried to duck and kind of run away,” but he was
 continually “side blinded[.]” He tripped on the curb six feet
 from the car and fell into the photo shop doorway. Respondent
 was kicked and struck “at least ten” times during the thirty-to­
8
 On  cross  examination,  Kepa  changed  his  story  and  stated  that  he
 
“never  saw  [the  fight  between  Respondent  and  Kala]  get  physical.”
  
7
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
forty-five seconds he was in the doorway. Stephanie attempted to
 
pull Respondent’s attackers away, which allowed Respondent to
 escape. 
Respondent “scrambled out of the doorway[]” when he was
 
struck on the back of his head and he fell forward seven to eight
 feet from Lucy’s car. Respondent made an effort to stand, but he
 was kicked and he “curled up” on the ground. Respondent
 attempted to leave, and “crawled[]” around the car. He “got up
 and stumbled and just swung a punch.” 
According to Respondent, he “swung blindly, and just
 
[attempted] to hit whoever was around [him] because [he] was
 getting attacked.” He put his head down and was in a crouched
 position, and “just swung blindly[.]” Respondent struck Kapena. 
Respondent struggled to move away but was hit in the back of the
 head. Respondent sought to defend himself, but the kicking and
 punching continued. At some point, the police arrested him. 
5.	 John Cooprider
 
According to Cooprider, the bar closes at approximately
 
1:15 a.m. Once customers leave, they may socialize in the
 parking lot. Bar employees attempt to clear the parking lot to
 “make sure no one is stumbling, . . . fighting, [or] drinking[.]” 
Cooprider’s duties included overseeing activities and ensuring
 people were safe, and not “over intoxicated.” If patrons are
 stumbling and intoxicated, Cooprider and his staff find them a
 taxi or a ride home. 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
That night, everyone was out of the bar by 1:30. 
Cooprider walked, with another security guard, across the parking
 
lot to the corner of Paradise Photo. There, he noticed Kapena
 and another male standing close to each other and speaking
 loudly. Kapena was not with a group of people, but “was by
 himself[]” when he was taking with the male. According to
 Cooprider, the man conversing with Kapena appeared to be with
 Respondent. 
He also noticed a “commotion” among a group consisting
 
of mostly males and security guards twenty yards away from him.
 Security guards were “trying to get people to leave[,]” as if
 “there [had been] an altercation[.]” Cooprider did not feel that
 he had to help because the situation was “under control.” 
Instead, Cooprider turned his attention to the two men having a
 conversation. Cooprider was five or six feet from them, and
 although Cooprider was “concerned enough” to pay attention, he
 did not think their conversation would result in a physical
 confrontation. According to Cooprider, “it seemed like they were
 arguing about something” and were “a little passionate,” but the
 males’ hands were down at their sides. He did not notice any
 women. 
About thirty seconds later, Cooprider observed
 
Respondent, who was by himself, walk away from the commotion,
 towards the two men, in a “calm, cool, collective [sic]” manner.
 Cooprider observed Respondent move to the corner of Paradise

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Photo. Respondent “did not have any cuts, bruises, [or] bleeding
 
whatsoever[.]” Respondent “walked approximately 30 inches in
 front of [Cooprider], and [] looked over to the left[,] saw
 [Kapena,] and hit him” “with everything he had[.]” According to
 Cooprider, Kapena “did not see [Respondent] coming[.]” In his
 view, Respondent “blind sided a helpless person.” 
After Respondent struck the man, he defended himself
 
from approximately fifteen people who “charge[d] him.” Cooprider
 noticed two women defending Respondent and pushing other men off
 of him. Cooprider and the security guards attempted to
 intervene, but the fight continued. At one point, Cooprider
 pulled Respondent off of someone else and put him on the ground. 
6. Police officers
 
Maui police officers arrived at the scene at
 
approximately 2:00 a.m. By that time, the affray had ended. 
Kapena was taken to the hospital where he was treated for two
 fractures. An officer noticed that Respondent had a cut lip and
 bruises. 
B.
 
In closing argument, the prosecutor maintained that the
 
“issue” was whether Respondent acted in self defense; Respondent
 did not act in self defense and the defense witnesses,
 Respondent, Stephanie, and Lucy, were not credible; particularly,
 Respondent was not credible because he had been present and heard
 voir dire and the testimony of other witnesses:
 
10
         
           
    
  
  
        
             
            
        
              
     
       
          
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
So, you find out a little bit more about the character of
the individual we’re talking about.
Well,  [Lucy]  got  CPR  training,  yada,  yada,  yada,  but
she  doesn’t  take  the  time  to  dial  911.   What  was  brought  up
about  her  on  the  stand  is  if  you  notice,  you  folks  had  a
chance  to  see  her  demeanor.   When  we’re  asking  about
somebody,  regardless  of  the  reason  why,  even  if  they  want  to
claim  self-defense,  there’s  somebody,  a  boy  injured  on  the
ground,  knocked  out,  blood  coming  out  of  his  head  with  his
jaw  busted  in  two  places.   How  does  she  react?   Doesn’t  that
 
tell  you  a  lot  about  the  character  of  the  individual?
Some  of  you  during  voir  dire  and  jury  selection  were
asked  about  what  you  would  look  at,  and  the  defense  went
into  great  detail.   Remember  one  thing  that  was  asked  by  me
 
to  [Respondent]?   You  know,  [Respondent],  first  of  all,  is
entitled,  since  he’s  on  trial  here,  is  entitled  to  hear  and
see  all  the  witnesses.   But  with  that  becomes  the  facts
 
[sic]  that  he’s  benefitted  from  seeing  all  these  witnesses.
  
Before  he  got  up  on  that  stand,  he  saw  each  and  every  one  of
the  witnesses,  heard  what  they  were  going  to  say.
  
What’s  i mportant  about  that  is  not  only  that,  he  heard
the  voir-diring  questions,  which  some  of  you  had  mentioned,
I  believe  you  said,  well,  you  know,  if  they  looked  me  in  the
 
eye.   Okay,  so  he  gets  up  here  and  looks  each  one  of  you  in
the  eye.   See  how  sincere  I  am?   Does  that  mean  you’re
 
sincere?   Well,  what  about,  you  know,  Kepa  got  up  there,  and
he  w as  nervous.   Remember  Iokepa  and  Kapena,  they  had  never
been  in  trouble  before  and  never  testified  before.   They  get
 
up  here.   They  were  nervous.   Yeah,  think  about  it.    You
 
have  to  come  up  here  for  the  first  time  in  this  kind  of
atmosphere,  you’re  going  to  be  nervous.
 
. .
. .
 
.  .  .  [W]hy  it  is  important  that  you  remember  that
testimony  that  was  given  to  you  last  week  from  [Cooprider],
the  only  sober,  the  only  independent  witness  that  was  there,
what  he  saw,  what  axe  did  he  have  to  grind.   We’ll  get  into
 
that.
 
But  t he  fact  of  the  matter  is  it  is  important  that
when  the  [c]ourt  has  read  you  those  instructions  about  .  .  .
the  credibility  of  witnesses,  yes,  you  take  into
consideration  all  those  items  such  as  their  appearance  and
demeanor,  their  manner  of  testifying,  the  i ntelligence,
candor  a nd  frankness,  the  lack  thereof,  the  interest  in
[sic]  bias  and  motives  for  testifying ,  the  opportunity  for
acquiring  information,  the  probability  or  improbability  of
the  witness’  testimony[,]  the  extent  to  which  a  witness  is
supported  or  contradicted  by  other  evidence  and  supported
[sic]  the  extent  to  which  a  witness  gave  contradictory
statements  and  whether  at  trial  or  at  other  times  and  all
 
other  circumstances  surrounding  it.
Bu
t don’t get fooled into a position where somebody
can look you in the eye, they must be telling the truth. If
 you know how to look somebody in the eye, you can still lie.
If we look at the independent witnesses [sic] [Cooprider],
what axe did he have to grind? What does he tell you? It
 corroborates everybody’s testimony, even corroborates even
[sic] [Respondent’s] own testimony. What does [Cooprider]
 say? He’s sitting there. He watches [Respondent], not, oh,
crawling on the ground getting up. . . .
 
(Emphases added.)

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Respondent’s counsel in part responded to the
 
prosecutor’s attack on Respondent’s credibility by emphasizing
 
that Respondent had been “upfront” and had “told . . . the
 truth.” Respondent’s counsel urged the jury not to “speculat[e]”
 or reach a verdict by “looking at [Respondent] and thinking . . .
 [that Kapena and Kepa] looked a lot nicer[.]” In rebuttal, the
 prosecutor maintained, among other things, that Respondent “was
 lying” and, in contrast, “Cooprider did tell . . . the full
 story[.]” 
On January 26, 2009, the jury found Respondent guilty.
 
II.
 
A.
 
On appeal to the ICA, Respondent argued, inter alia,
9
 
that the court erred in (1) “allowing the prosecutor to make the
 constitutionally impermissible argument during closing argument
 that [Respondent] heard the testimony of all other witnesses and
 tailored his testimony to match the evidence[,]” and in
 (2) “allowing the prosecutor to argue that [Respondent’s]
 presence during jury selection allowed him to adapt his manner of
 testifying based on the jurors’ answers during voir dire in order
 to appear more credible to the jury.” According to Respondent,
 the statements regarding Respondent’s attendance during voir dire
 
9
 Respondent  also  argued  that  the  prosecutor’s  statements  during
 
closing  argument  deprived  Respondent  of  his  rights  to  due  process  and  a  fair
trial,  and  that  the  court  “plainly  erred  in  failing  to  instruct  the  jury  that
[Respondent]  had  a  constitutional  right  to  be  present  throughout  trial,  .  .  .
and  that  the  jury  must  not  draw  any  unfavorable  presence  based  simply  on  his
presence  throughout  the  trial.”
   
12
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and testimony “impermissibly infringed on [Respondent’s] 
constitutional right to be present during the trial . . . and had a chilling effect on [Respondent’s] right to testify on his own behalf[.]” Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i 
(Petitioner or the prosecution) countered that the prosecutor’s comments were proper. 
Both parties relied on Portuondo v. Agard, 529 U.S. 61,
 
10 11
 and
 64 (2000), which held that a defendant’s Fifth,  Sixth,  Fourteenth Amendment
12 rights were not violated when the
 
prosecutor, in her summation, highlighted that “the defendant has
 a benefit and the benefit that he has, unlike all the other
 witnesses, is . . . to sit here and listen to the testimony of
 all the other witnesses before he testifies.” Indeed, the
 Portuondo majority stated that the truth-seeking function of
 trial is served by the prosecutor commenting on a defendant’s
 “opportunity” to tailor his testimony. Id. at 73. 
Justice Stevens concurred, disagreeing with the
 
majority’s implicit endorsement of the prosecutor’s argument
 which, in his view, demeaned the truth-seeking function of the
 adversary process, violated the defendant’s individual dignity,
 
10
 The  defendant  argued  that  his  Fifth  Amendment  right  to  testify  on
 
his  own  behalf  was  violated.   529  U.S.  at  65.
 
11
 The  defendant  argued  that  the  prosecutor’s  comments  unlawfully
 
burdened  his  Sixth  Amendment  rights  to  be  present  at  trial,  to  testify  on  his
own  behalf,  and  to  be  confronted  with  the  witnesses  against  him.   Id.
 
12
 The  defendant  argued  that  because  New  York  law  required  him  to  be
 
present  at  trial,  the  prosecution  violated  his  right  to  due  process  by
commenting  on  that  presence.   Id.  at  74.
  
13
         
         
      
         
        
      
       
        
         
         
        
       
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and ignored the presumption of innocence. Id. at 76 (Stevens,
 
J., concurring, joined by Breyer, J.). However, Justice Stevens
 
suggested that the states could prohibit such argument or
 instruct the jury that a defendant had a right to be present at
 trial:
 
The Court’s final conclusion, . . . that the argument
survives constitutional scrutiny does not, of course,
deprive States or trial judges of the power either to
prevent such argument entirely or to provide juries with
instructions that explain the necessity, and the
justifications, for the defendant’s attendance at trial.
 
Id. (emphasis added). Justice Ginsburg dissented, concluding
 
that the majority’s holding transformed the defendant’s presence
 at trial “from a Sixth Amendment right into an automatic burden
 on his credibility[,]” id. at 76 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting,
 joined by Souter, J.), and that “[i]n the end, we are left with a
 prosecutorial practice that burdens the constitutional rights of
 defendants, that cannot be justified by reference to the trial's
 aim of sorting guilty defendants from innocent ones, and that is
 not supported by our case law.” Id. at 88 (Ginsburg, J.,
 
dissenting, joined by Souter, J.). The Portuondo dissent
 reasoned that a generic tailoring argument during summation was
 improper:
 
The prosecutorial comment at issue, tied only to the
defendant’s presence in the courtroom and not to his actual
testimony, tarnishes the innocent no less than the guilty.
Nor can a jury measure a defendant’s credibility by
evaluating the defendant's response to the accusation, for
the broadside is fired after the defense has submitted its
 
case
.
 
Id. at 77-78 (emphasis added). 
14
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
According to the Portuondo dissent, generic tailoring
 
comments occur when the prosecutor uses “the mere fact of the
 
defendant’s presence at his trial as the basis for impugning his
 credibility.” Id. at 78. In the dissent’s view, a prosecutor,
 
during closing argument, should not be permitted to comment on a
 defendant’s trial presence “where there is no particular reason
 to believe that tailoring has occurred and where the defendant
 has no opportunity to rebut the accusation.” Id. On the other
 
hand, the dissent by Justice Ginsburg would have permitted the
 prosecutor during summation to make a specific tailoring argument
 that the defendant tailored “specific elements of his testimony
 to fit with particular testimony given by other witnesses[.]” 
Id. 
Justice Ginsburg noted that several state courts had
 
found it improper for prosecutors to make accusations of
 tailoring based solely on “the defendant’s constant attendance at
 trial.” Id. at 83 n.5. In sum, according to her, a defendant’s
 
Sixth Amendment rights are burdened when a prosecutor, during
 summation, suggests that the defendant tailored his testimony
 without pointing to specific facts indicating tailoring. Id. at
 
77. 
Respondent “urge[d the ICA] to reject the holding of
 
the Portuondo majority, as its reasoning does not adequately
 preserve a criminal defendant’s right to confrontation[.]” 
According to Respondent, “[o]ther state courts have addressed
 
15
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
this issue and concluded that prosecutorial comments made during

13 In  Jones,  the  prosecutor  during  closing  argument  stated  that  “[the
 
defendant]  had  the  benefit  of  knowing  what  everybody  else  said  before  he
testified.   What  opportunity  did  that  give  [the  defendant]  to  testify  as  he
 
did?”   580  A.2d  at  162  (emphasis  added).   The  Maine  Supreme  Court  held  that
the  comment  infringed  on  the  defendant’s  right  to  confront  witnesses  and  be
present  at  trial,  stating,  “A  direct  comment  by  the  prosecutor  that  invites
the  jury  to  draw  an  adverse  inference  from  the  defendant’s  presence  at  trial
and  his  corresponding  opportunity  to  hear  all  the  witnesses  testify  is  error.”
  
Id.  at  163.
  
14 In  Person,  the  defendant’s  attorney,  during  summation,  argued  that
 
there  were  several  deficiencies  in  the  prosecutor’s  case.   During  summation,
 
the  prosecutor  questioned  whether  “it  [is]  just  a  little  bit  odd  that  after
sitting  here  for  six  days  and  listening  to  all  the  testimony[,  the  defendant]
comes  in  and  gives  a  completely  tailored  cover  story  covering  every  single
aspect”  of  the  case.   508  N.E.2d  at  90.   According  to  Person,  the  statement
was  improper  because  a  defendant  is  entitled  to  hear  the  evidence  and  confront
the  witnesses  against  him.   Id.   Although  the  defense  criticized  the
prosecution’s  case,  the  prosecutor  was  not  “justified  in  making  th[e]
 
argument.”   Id.  at  90-91.
  
15 In  Elberry,  the  prosecutor  in  his  closing  argument  stated  that
 
inconsistencies  in  stories  were  natural  among  witnesses  who  had  not  lied  and
who  had  not  heard  one  another’s  testimony.   645  N.E.2d  at  42.   The  prosecutor
 
then  emphasized,
  
Did  any  of  the  witnesses  have  the  opportunity  to  see  exactly
how  every  other  witness  testified  in  this  case  and  then
tailor  their  testimony  to  that  evidence?   Some  of  you  are
 
shaking  your  heads.   One  person  did,  one  witness  did,  one
witness  saw  every  other  person  testify,  the  defendant
(pointing).
 
Id.   Defense  counsel  objected,  and  the  court  gave  a  curative  instruction.   Id.
 
at  43.   The  Appeals  Court  of  Massachusetts,  relying  on  Person,  held  that  the
prosecutor’s  remark  was  “out  of  bounds  and  should  not  have  been  made[,]”  but
 
the  curative  instruction,  to  which  no  party  objected,  “disposed  of  the
 
matter.”   Id.

Johnson, 908 P.2d 900, 903 (Wash. Ct. App. 1996).16 Petitioner 
countered that Portuondo was “consistent with Hawai' i case law.” 
B.
 
After the briefs were submitted, this court decided
 
Mattson, which addressed the application of Portuondo in this
 
jurisdiction. The Mattson majority essentially adopted the
 reasoning of Justice Ginsburg’s dissent in Portuondo and held
 that, “it would be improper under article I, section 14 of the
 Hawai'i Constitution, for the prosecution to make generic 
accusations during closing argument that a defendant tailored his
 testimony based solely on the defendant’s exercise of his
 constitutional right to be present during the trial.” 122
 Hawai'i at 326, 226 P.3d at 496. In line with the Portuondo 
dissent, the majority said generic tailoring accusations “cannot
 sort those who tailor their testimony from those who do not, much
 
16 Johnson  noted  that  a  prosecutor’s  comments  that  the  defendant  had 
a  “unique  opportunity  to  be  present  at  trial  and  hear  all  the  testimony
against  him”  impermissibly  infringed  on  the  defendant’s  Sixth  Amendment  rights
under  the  United  States  Constitution.   908  P.2d  at  903.   No  state 
constitutional  issues  were  raised  in  Johnson.   Id.  at  902  n.1.   “Portuondo 
effectively  overrule[d]  Johnson [.]”   State  v.  Miller,  40  P.3d  692,  693  (Wash. 
Ct.  App.  2002).   However,  where  tailoring  questions  were  asked  during  cross
examination,  the  Washington  Supreme  Court  determined  that  “suggestions  of 
tailoring  are  appropriate  during  cross-examination[.]”   State  v.  Martin,  252 
P.3d  872,  879  (Wash.  2011).   The  Martin  dissent  maintained  that  “all 
accusations  of  tailoring  at  any  stage  of  the  trial,  including
cross-examination  and  summation,”  should  be  prohibited.   Id.  at  884  (Sanders,
J.,  dissenting);  see  id.  at  883  (explaining  that  tailoring  arguments  “afford 
no  meaningful  protection  of  a  criminal  defendant’s  constitutional”  rights,  and 
prohibiting  them  allows  the  jury  to  “‘draw  its  own  reasonable  inferences  based 
on  the  evidence,  rather  than  rely,  even  in  part,  on  accusations  that  the
defendant  was  able  to  shape  his  testimony  simply  because  [the  defendant]  was
present,  as  he  had  a  right  to  be,  at  his  own  trial[]’”  (quoting  State  v. 
Mattson,  122  Hawai'i  312,  343,  226  P.3d  482,  499  (2010)  (Acoba,  J.,
dissenting,  joined  by  Duffy,  J.)).   The  concurrence  “agree[d]  with  the  dissent
that  .  .  .  [the  Washington  Constitution]  does  not  permit  the  State  to  suggest
the  defendant  has  tailored  his  testimony[,]”  but  agreed  with  the  majority’s 
result  because  the  error  was  harmless.   Id.  at  880  (Stephens,  J.,  concurring
in  part  and  dissenting  in  part,  joined  by  Chambers  and  Fairhurst,  JJ.).

less the guilty from the innocent.” Id. (internal quotation
 
marks and citation omitted). Moreover, generic tailoring
 
arguments “disregard the truth-seeking purpose of a trial
 inasmuch as generic accusations of tailoring do not aid the jury
 in any way in determining whether a defendant has tailored his
 testimony or simply related a true version of the events.” Id.
 
(emphasis in original). 
According to the majority, the prosecutor in Mattson
 
did not make a generic tailoring argument. In Mattson, two
 witnesses testified that the defendant had threatened an
 individual with a knife. Id. at 315-17, 226 P.3d at 485-87. A
 
911 recording of a phone call of one of the witnesses explaining
 that the defendant was “pulling a knife” on another person was
 “admitted into evidence” and played for the jury at trial. Id.
 
at 317 n.4, 226 P.3d at 487 n.4. The defendant had previously
 told the police that he held a lighter during the incident. Id.
 
at 320, 226 P.3d at 490. Contrary to the statement to the police
 and similar to the witnesses’ testimony, at trial, the defendant
 testified that he held an unopened knife during the incident but
 had not used it in a threatening manner. Id. at 319-20, 226 P.3d
 
at 489-90. He also explained that he had “made up” part of the
 story he had told the police because he “only wanted to make the
 statement that help[ed him].” Id. at 320, 226 P.3d at 490
 
(brackets in original). During summation, the prosecutor
 emphasized that the defendant’s trial testimony contradicted the

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
defendant’s prior statement to the police and the testimony of
 
other witnesses:
 
He told you he lied before. He had a chance to sit through
 
the evidence. He had to make his story gibe [sic] with what
 you’ve heard. What is in evidence. . . . He sat through
 
the evidence. There is a 911 tape. [A witness’s]
 statement. [ Another witness’s] statement. Based on all
 
that, he is not telling the truth. All of a sudden he
 
remembered that he grabbed that knife.
 
Id. (some emphases added, some emphases in original). According
 
to the Mattson majority, because the prosecutor “identified and
 relied upon specific evidence adduced at trial” in addition to
 the defendant’s presence when attacking the defendant’s
 credibility, the prosecutor did not improperly argue the
 defendant “tailored his testimony based solely on his presence at
 trial.”
17 Id. at 327, 226 P.3d at 497 (emphasis in original).
 
C.
 
In a similar vein as the majority, the Mattson  dissent
 
noted that generic comments “debase the ‘truth-seeking function
 of the adversary process,’ violate the ‘respect for the
 
17 The  concurrence  herein  contends  that  Mattson  p rohibited  only  “bare 
ac
cusation[s]”  or  argument  in  the  form  of  “[h]e  was  here,  therefore  he 
tailored[.]”   Concurring  opinion  at  17.   Respectfully,  we  disagree  with  this 
narrow  characterization  of  Mattson.   Mattson  forbade  accusing  a  defendant  of 
tailoring  because  his  presence  was  “conduct  as  consistent  with  innocence  as 
with  guilt,”  and  such  an  argument  would  not  help  the  jury  “in  determining
whether  a  defendant  has  tailored  his  testimony  or  simply  related  a  true
version  of  the  events.”   122  Hawai'i  at  326,  226  P.3d  at  496.   Moreover,  the 
Mattson  majority  w as  “persuaded  by  the  reasoning  of  the  P
ortuondo  d issent[,]”
id
.,  which  maintained  that  a  prosecutor  may  not  argue  that  a  defendant’s
testimony,  “consistent  with  [the]  other  evidence  in  the  case[,]”  was  due  to 
his  presence,  529  U.S.  at  77,  because  “[t]he  implication  of  th[at]  argument
seems  to  be  that  the  more  a  defendant’s  story  hangs  together,  the  more  likely
it  is  that  he  is  lying[,]”  id.  at  79  n.1,  an  argument  that  does  not  help  to
“distinguish  the  guilty  from  the  innocent[,]”  id.  at  79.   By  stating  that
generic  tailoring  only  occurs  when  it  is  asserted  that  the  defendant  tailored
his  testimony  because  “[h]e  was  here,”  the  dissent  restricts,  and  unduly
confines,  Mattson  and  the  objection  to  generic  tailoring.  
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
defendant’s individual dignity,’ and ignore ‘the presumption of
 
innocence that survives until a guilty verdict is returned[.]’” 
Id. at 340, 226 P.3d at 510 (Acoba, J., dissenting, joined by
 Duffy, J.) (quoting State v. Daniels, 861 A.2d 808, 819 (N.J.
 2004) (quoting Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 76 (Stevens, J.,
 concurring, joined by Breyer, J.))).
18 The dissent explained
 
that a generic tailoring argument occurs when “a prosecutor
 states that the defendant was able to sit through the trial and
 hear the testimony of other witnesses, thereby allowing the
 defendant the opportunity to shape his or her testimony to fit
 that of other witnesses, even when there is no evidence that
 defendant has actually done so.” Id. at 336, 226 P.3d at 506. 
Thus, while a prosecutor may cast doubt on the substance of a
 defendant’s testimony, “where the exercise of constitutional
 rights is ‘insolubly ambiguous’ as between innocence and guilt, a
 prosecutor may not unfairly encumber those rights by urging the
 jury to construe the ambiguity against the defendant.” Id. at
 
338, 226 P.3d at 508 (quoting Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 77
 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting, joined by Souter, J.)). 
Hence, generic tailoring comments on summation
 
“suggesting that a defendant tailored his testimony inverts those
 rights, permitting the prosecutor to punish the defendant for
 
18
 The  Mattson  dissent  would  have  held  that  “all  accusations  of 
tailoring  at  any  stage  of  the  trial,  including  cross  examination  and
summation,  impermissibly  burden  a  defendant’s  right  to  be  present  at  trial  and
to  confront  witnesses  against  him.”   122  Hawai'i  at  329,  226  P.3d  at  499 
(Acoba,  J.  dissenting,  joined  by  Duffy,  J.).  
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
exercising that which the Constitution guarantees.” Id. at 340, 
226 P.3d at 510.19 (internal quotation marks, citation, and 
emphasis omitted). Additionally, “[a]lthough the constitutional 
right to confront witnesses should be sufficient to justify a rule barring accusations of tailoring, the additional fact that Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 43 (2008) mandates 
defendants . . . to be present at all stages of the trial further compels prohibiting such accusations.”
20 Id. at 329, 226 P.3d at 
499. The Mattson dissent explained that “a specific tailoring
 
argument is made when the prosecution alludes to facts indicating
 that a defendant has tailored specific elements of his testimony
 to fit with particular testimony given by other witnesses.” Id.
 
at 336, 226 P.3d at 506 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and
 citation omitted).
 
In sum, the prosecution should be prohibited from
 
“referring to the fact that the defendant was in the courtroom or
 that he heard the testimony of other witnesses, and was thus able
 to tailor his testimony.” Id. at 328, 226 P.3d at 498 (internal
 
19 With  respect  to  a  prosecutor’s  specific  tailoring  remarks  during
 
summation,  the  Mattson  dissent  noted  that  allowing  such  comments  “afford  no
 
meaningful  protection  of  a  criminal  defendant’s  constitutional  right  to
confrontation.”   Id.  at  343,  226  P.3d  at  513.   As  it  is  permissible  for  a
 
prosecutor  to  “state,  discuss,  and  comment  on  the  evidence  as  well  as  draw  all
reasonable  inferences”  therefrom,  it  is  unnecessary  to  allow  comment  on  the
defendant’s  trial  presence  in  connection  with  remarks  on  the  evidence  during
summation.   Id.  at  345,  226  P.3d  at  515  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation
 
omitted).
    
20
 HRPP  Rule  43(a)  generally  provides  that  in  felony  cases  “[t]he
 
defendant  shall  be  present  at  the  arraignment,  at  the  time  of  the  plea,  at
evidentiary  pretrial  hearings,  at  every  stage  of  the  trial  including  the
impaneling  of  the  jury  and  t he  return  of  the  verdict,  and  at  the  imposition  of
se
ntence,  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  this  rule.”   (Emphasis  added.)
 
21
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
quotation marks and citation omitted). Consequently, in Mattson,
 
“the prosecutor’s general statements directly attacking [the
 defendant’s] presence at trial, and his concomitant ability
 therefore to make his story gibe [sic] wrongly infringed on [the
 defendant’s] rights to be present at trial and to testify.” Id.
 
at 341, 226 P.3d at 511 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
III.
 
Following the rule established in Mattson, the ICA 
majority in this case found the prosecutor’s remarks were “a generic accusation” that Respondent tailored his testimony because they did not “reference any evidence and relate[d] only to [Respondent’s] presence in the courtroom.” Walsh, 123 Hawai' i 
at 289, 231 P.3d at 1006. According to the ICA majority, the prosecutor “drew attention to [Respondent’s] presence during witness testimony and jury voir dire, emphasized that [Respondent] had heard all of the testimony prior to testifying himself, and implied that [Respondent] tailored his testimony to appear more credible.” Id. While the prosecutor did not 
explicitly state that Respondent tailored his testimony, according to the ICA, the “implication of the prosecutor’s argument . . . was such that the jury was left with the inescapable conclusion that because [Respondent] exercised his right to be present during jury voir dire and other witnesses’ testimony, he was tailoring his testimony.” Id. Thus, the ICA 
vacated the judgment and remanded the case. 
22
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Although the ICA majority analyzed the prosecutor’s
 
comments as a whole, the concurrence reasoned that some of the
 
prosecutor’s comments were proper and some were not. The
 concurrence agreed that the prosecutor’s remarks that Respondent
 “benefitted from seeing all these witnesses[]” because “[b]efore
 he got up on that stand, he saw each and every one” of them, were
 improper because they were not “premised on any evidence
 presented during trial to support the inference that [Respondent]
 had tailored his testimony based on what he had heard.” Id. at
 
290-91, 231 P.3d at 1007-08 (Fujise, J., concurring). 
However, the concurrence maintained the prosecutor made
 
the “separate point[]” that Respondent, “having heard some of the
 jurors state that they took eye contact as indicative of
 truthfulness[,] actually took their cue and looked at the jurors
 during his testimony.” Id. at 291, 231 P.3d at 1008.
21
 
According to the concurrence, because the “jurors heard the
 responses given during voir dire and witnessed [Respondent’s]
 
21 Respectfully,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Respondent  “actually” 
“took  [the  juror(s)]  cue,”  assuming  that  there  was  such  a  “cue.”   123  Hawai'i 
at  291,  231  P.3d  at  1008.   Nowhere  in  the  record  is  this  matter  noted  or 
discussed.   “It  is  very  difficult  for  an  appellate  court  to  review  an  issue
that  is  not  grounded  in  the  record.”   United  States  v.  Schuler,  813  F.2d  978, 
980  (9th  Cir.  1987).   Thus,  Schuler  aptly  advised,  “[i]f  counsel  considers
such  an  [action]  to  be  significant,  he  or  she  should  ask  the  trial  court  to
have  it  included  in  the  record.”   Id.  
The  principle  that  appellate  review  requires  a  complete  record  of
the  events  relied  upon  is  salutary  and  well-established,  irrespective  of
whether  the  demeanor  challenged  on  appeal  was  that  of  a  witness  on  the  stand
or  that  of  a  witness  off  the  stand,  or  whether  the  case  was  a  criminal  or
civil  one.   Consequently,  if  a  litigator  seeks  appellate  review  based  on
 
particular  “demeanor”  that  occurred  during  trial,  when  there  is  no  record  that
such  occurred,  it  is  not  unexpected  that  it  would  be  “very  difficult  for  an
appellate  court  to  review  an  issue  that  is  not  grounded  in  the  record[.]”
  
Schuler,  813  F.2d  at  980.   In  that  circumstance,  there  can  be  no  reasonable
expectation  that  the  occurrence  itself  will  be  unquestionably  accepted  for
purposes  of  appellate  review.

trial testimony[,]” “they were in the best position to judge
 
whether [Respondent] tailored his comportment to their
 comments[.]” Id. However, the concurrence apparently agreed the
 
case should be remanded for a new trial based on the prosecutor’s
 remarks referring to Respondent’s “benefit” of being present
 during the testimony of other witnesses. 
IV.
 
Petitioner applied for certiorari, asking
 
[w]hether the ICA gravely erred when it held, that the
prosecutor’s comments during closing argument, implying that[Respondent] tailored his testimony to be more credibleafter being present at jury voir dire and during otherwitnesses’ testimony, constituted plain error and thus,violated [Respondent’s] State of Hawai 'i Constitutional 
right to be present during trial. 
V.
 
In support of the question presented in its
 
Application, Petitioner argues that (1) the alleged improper
 
comments did not constitute plain error affecting Respondent’s
 substantial rights; (2) the prosecutor “did not rely solely on
 [Respondent’s] exercise of his right to be present at trial[,]”
 but referred to “specific evidence adduced at trial” and a jury
 instruction regarding the credibility of witnesses, and,
 therefore, the statements were permissible under Mattson; (3) the
 prosecutor’s comments that Respondent tailored his demeanor based
 on juror answers during voir dire were not improper because they
 were an attempt to discredit the manner in which Respondent
 testified; (4) the jury did not dismiss Respondent’s testimony
 based on an implication of tailoring; and (5) “although the issue
 
24
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in this case was the credibility of the witnesses, the evidence
 
against [Respondent] indicating that [Respondent] recklessly
 caused substantial bodily injury to [Kapena] was overwhelming.” 
VI.
 
A.
 
Petitioner’s first argument that the ICA gravely erred 
by reviewing the statements under plain error is incorrect because the statements affected Respondent’s constitutional rights to confront witnesses, to be present at trial, to testify, and to a fair trial. See State v. Miller, 122 Hawai' i 92, 100, 
223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010) (noting that, if error in the proceedings adversely affected the substantial rights of the defendant, the error is plain error). It is established that, under the plain error doctrine, “where plain error has been committed and substantial rights have been affected thereby, the error may be noticed even though it was not brought to the attention of the trial court.” Id. (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted); see HRPP Rule 52(b) (2008) (“Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.”); State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513, 78 P.3d 317, 326 (2003) (“If 
defense counsel does not object at trial to prosecutorial misconduct,” “[w]e may recognize plain error when the error committed affects substantial rights of the defendant.”) (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.). Moreover, 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
this court will apply the plain error standard of review “to
 
correct errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or
 public reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of
 justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights.” State
 
v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998). 
“The purpose of plain error is to allow the court to 
vindicate substantial rights and to uphold the integrity of the judicial system, regardless of the venue in which the appellant failed to present the argument.” Miller, 122 Hawai' i at 119-20, 
223 P.3d at 184-85. This court’s ability to review for plain error stems from its inherent power to recognize such error sua sponte. Id. at 122 n.31, 223 P.3d at 187 n.31. Of course, we 
can employ the power to review an error that allegedly affects substantial rights, but upon such review conclude that no error had occurred. Id. 
B.
 
In holding that it is improper for the prosecution “to 
make generic” tailoring accusations during closing argument, 122 Hawai'i at 326, 226 P.3d at 496, Mattson emphasized that 
“upholding a defendant’s rights under the confrontation clause is essential to providing a defendant with a fair trial[]” and that “a prosecutor’s comments may not infringe on a defendant’s constitutional rights[,]” id. at 325, 226 P.3d at 495 (emphasis in original). The right of confrontation is a substantial right. See State v. Kassebeer, 118 Hawai' i 493, 516, 193 P.3d 409, 432 
26
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(2008) (holding that prohibiting a complainant from answering a 
defendant’s question “inhibited [the defendant] from confronting the complainant” and therefore “adversely affected his substantial right to confrontation[]”). The “confrontation right provides the criminal defendant with the opportunity to defend himself [or herself] through our adversary system by prohibiting ex parte trials, granting the defendant an opportunity to test the evidence in front of a jury, and guaranteeing the right to face-to-face confrontation.” Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 325, 226 
P.3d at 594 (quoting State v. Apilando, 79 Hawai' i 128, 132, 900 
P.2d 135, 139 (1995) (brackets in original)) (other citation omitted). 
Generic accusations of tailoring also “discourage a
 
22
 defendant from exercising his constitutional right to testify[ ]
on his own behalf.” Id. at 326, 226 P.3d at 496. This court,
 
based on an independent review of the record, has held that
 “[b]ecause the circuit court’s error infringed upon [the
 defendant’s] constitutional right to testify, we address it as
 
22 The  right  of  a  defendant  to  testify  is  guaranteed  by  sections  5, 
14,  and  10  of  article  I  of  the  Hawai'i  Constitution.   Tachibana  v.  State,  79 
Hawai'i  226,  231,  900  P.2d  1293,  1298  (1995).   The  right  is  “essential  to  due 
process  of  law”  as  guaranteed  under  section  5  of  article  1.   Id.  (internal 
citation  omitted).   The  right  to  testify  is  also  guaranteed  through  the
compulsory  process  clause  of  section  14,  which  states  in  pertinent  part  that
the  accused  shall  “have  compulsory  process  for  obtaining  witnesses  in  the
accused’s  favor[.]”   Haw.  Const.  art.  1,  §  14.   “Logically  included  in  the
accused's  right  to  call  witnesses  .  .  .  is  a  right  to  testify  himself,  should
he  decide  it  is  in  his  favor  to  do  so[,]”  since   “the  most  important  witness
for  the  defense  in  many  criminal  cases  is  the  defendant  himself.”   Rock  v. 
Arkansas,  483  U.S.  44,  52  (1987).   The  opportunity  to  testify  is  a  necessary
corollary  to  the  guarantee,  under  section  10,  against  compelled  testimony
since  every  criminal  defendant  is  privileged  to  testify  in  his  or  her  defense.

plain error.” State v. Staley, 91 Hawai' i 275, 286, 982 P.2d 
904, 915 (1999); see also Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i at 516, 78 P.3d 
at 329 (holding that prosecutor’s comment on the defendant’s
 
failure to testify constituted plain error affecting the
 defendant's substantial rights). 
Additionally, “[i]t is well settled that an accused has
 
a fundamental right to be present at each critical stage of the
 criminal proceeding.” Onaka v. Onaka, 112 Hawai' i 374, 380, 146 
P.3d 89, 95 (2006) (citations omitted). “The right of a criminal
 defendant to be present at his trial is of no less than
 constitutional magnitude, and is founded upon the Confrontation
 and Due Process clauses of both the United States and Hawai' i 
Constitutions.” State v. Okumura, 58 Haw. 425, 427, 570 P.2d
 
848, 851 (1977). It is a right of “fundamental importance[.]” 
State v. Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 320, 615 P.2d 91, 99 (1980).
23
 
23 Other  jurisdictions  have  held  that  the  right  to  be  present  is  a
 
fundamental  or  substantial  right.   See  Rushen  v.  Spain,  464  U.S.  114,  117
 
(1983)  (stating  that  the  “right  to  personal  presence  at  all  critical  stages  of
 
the  trial”  is  a  fundamental  right  of  a  criminal  defendant);  see  also  People  v.
Wilkinson,  110  Cal.  Rptr.  3d  776,  781  (Cal.  Ct.  App.  2010)  (noting  that  an
attorney  cannot  “authorize  relinquishment  of  substantial  rights,  such  as  the
right  to  be  present,  without  the  client’s  consent”);  State  v.  Calderon,  13
P.3d  871,  879  (Kan.  2000)  (articulating  that  the  “right  to  be  present  at  one’s
criminal  trial  is  a  fundamental  right[]”);  People  v.  Mallory,  365  N.W.2d  673,
681  n.10,  682  (Mich.  1984)  (explaining  that  a  defendant  has  a  right  to  be
present  during  any  stage  of  trial  where  his  substantial  rights  might  be
adversely  affected) ;  State  v.  Finnegan,  784  N.W.2d  243,  255  (Minn.  2010)
(defining  the  right  to  be  present  at  trial  as  a  fundamental  right);  State  v.
Muse,  967  S.W.2d  764,  766  (Tenn.  1998)  (“The  right  of  an  accused  to  be  present
at  his  own  trial  is  a  fundamental  trial  right.”);  but  see  People  v.  McLaurin,
922  N.E.2d  344,  352  (Ill.  2009)  (noting  that  the  right  to  be  present  at  trial
“is  not  itself  a  substantial  right  under  the  Illinois  Constitution[,]”  but  a
 
“lesser  right[,]  the  observance  of  which  is  a  means  to  securing  the
substantial  rights  of  a  defendant”)  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citations
omitted).
  
28
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Finally, the right to a fair trial is a substantial 
right for which this court has reviewed alleged violations of 
plain error. State v. Rapoza, 95 Hawai' i 321, 326, 22 P.3d 968, 
973 (2001) (noting that an erroneous jury instruction that has affected the “defendant’s substantial right[] -- to wit, his or her constitutional right[] to a trial by an impartial jury . . . -- may be recognized as plain error”); State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1303 (1986) (concluding that the prosecutor’s conduct impacted the defendant’s “right to a fair trial as to amount to ‘plain error’”). Because fundamental rights are infringed when generic tailoring arguments are made, generic tailoring arguments are subject to plain error review. 
C.
 
In support of its first argument, Petitioner maintains 
that the prosecutor’s statements did not “expressly” accuse Respondent of tailoring, and, therefore, the ICA extended Mattson to “tailoring by implication.” But there are no specific words or phrases that must be employed to accuse a defendant of tailoring. In Mattson, this court found the prosecutor “made an accusation that [the defendant] tailored his testimony to the evidence presented when she argued that ‘[h]e had to make his story gibe [sic] with what you’ve heard.’” 122 Hawai' i at 327, 
226 P.3d at 497 (brackets in original). Courts have found generic tailoring arguments based on a wide range of comments, 
29
         
        
       
         
        
         
        
         
 
           
         
           
              
             
             
                         
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
not all expressly arguing that the defendant engaged in
 
tailoring. 
In Jones, 580 A.2d at 162, the prosecutor stated: 
I suggest when you evaluate the credibility of these
witnesses and their testimony you also consider something
very important; the only witness who testified in this case
who heard everybody else's testimony before he gave his
reason was the defendant. [The defendant] had the benefit
of knowing what everybody else said before he testified.
What opportunity did that give [the defendant] to testify as
he did?
 
Because these comments were “tied only to the defendant's
 
presence in the courtroom and not to his actual testimony[,]”
 Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 77 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), they
 invited “the jury to draw an adverse inference from the
 defendant’s presence at trial and his corresponding opportunity
 to hear all the witnesses testify[,]” Jones, 580 A.2d at 163. 
In Hart v. United States, 538 A.2d 1146, 1149 (D.C.C.A.
 
1988), the prosecutor during rebuttal “suggested that [the
 defendant’s] testimony was fabricated[]” by stating:
 
Does that appear ridiculous? . . . [T]he most amazing thing
happened . . . during the course of [the defendant’s]
testimony. He started rapping and telling the story . . .
just popping into his head as he was going along. . . . He
 sits there and then he says the most incredible thing. . . .
Does that make any sense? . . . Does that sound like a
 person telling the truth? Gets on the stand and tells the
 truth? You will have to decide that. . . . Would you bank
 on that story?
 
According to Hart, “[t]he likely inference from the prosecutor's
 
remarks in [that] case was that he believed [] [the defendant’s]
 testimony was fabricated[,]” which was “especially troubling”
 because of the prosecutor’s “reference to [the defendant’s]
 listening to other testimony at trial.” Id. 
30
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Similar to Jones and Hart, here, the prosecutor accused
 
Respondent of tailoring his testimony when, in discussing
 
credibility, she argued that Respondent “benefitted” from hearing
 the testimony of the other witnesses before he testified. 
Manifestly the prosecutor’s remarks drew “the jury’s attention to
 [Respondent’s] presence at trial and his resultant opportunity to
 tailor his testimony[,]” Martinez v. People, 244 P.3d 135, 141
 (Colo. 2010), and submitted to the jurors that Respondent was
 less believable as a result. As in Portuondo, the prosecutor
 encouraged the jury to draw from the “fact” of the defendant’s
 opportunity to testify, the “inference” that he had actually
 tailored his testimony. 529 U.S. at 86 n.6 (Ginsburg, J.,
 dissenting, joined by Souter, J.) (emphases in original). The
 prosecutor’s comments in the instant case that Respondent
 “benefitted” from his trial presence are nearly identical to the
 comments that were found by the Portuondo dissent to be
 unconstitutional and improper. The prosecutor in Portuondo
 argued that “the defendant has a benefit and the benefit that he
 has[] [is that] he gets to sit here and listen to the testimony
 of all the other witnesses before he testifies.” Id. at 64
 
(emphases added). 
It also cannot be disputed reasonably, as the ICA
 
majority said, that “the prosecutor’s argument[] . . . was such
 that the jury was left with the inescapable conclusion that
 because [Respondent] exercised his right to be present during
 
31
         
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
. . . other witnesses’ testimony, he was tailoring his
 
testimony.” Walsh, 123 Hawai' i at 289, 231 P.3d at 1006. The 
contention that Respondent benefitted from listening to all the
 
other witnesses before testifying plainly conveyed to the jury
 
that Respondent’s testimony therefore should be discredited.24
 
Inasmuch as the comments that Respondent had benefitted were
 
based “solely” on Respondent’s presence at trial, they were
 generic tailoring comments prohibited by Mattson.
25
 
VII.
 
Petitioner’s second argument contends the prosecutor
 
“did not rely solely on [Respondent’s] exercise of his right to
 be present at trial[,]” but (1) “included references to specific
 evidence adduced at trial,” when she “immediately argued why the
 jury should believe [Kapena and Kepa] over [Respondent,]”
 subsequently argued that Cooprider was credible, and tried to
 “discredit” Respondent, and (2) reminded the jury of the standard
 jury instruction on evaluating witnesses. 
24 Hence,  under  the  circumstances,  it  was  not  necessary  that  the 
prosecution  also  argue  that  Respondent  was  able  to  think  about  “what  [he  was] 
going  to  say”  and  how  he  would  “fit  [his  testimony]  into  the  evidence[,]”
Portuondo,  529  U.S.  at  64  (Ginsburg,  J.,  dissenting,  joined  by  Souter,  J.),  or
that  Respondent  had  to  make  his  story  “gibe,”  [sic]  as  in  Mattson
25
 Although  the  concurrence  agrees  that  the  prosecution’s  statement
 
regarding  Respondent’s  “benefit[]”  is  improper  generic  tailoring  under
Mattson ,  it  maintains  that  such  a  conclusion  is  “dispositive,”  and,  therefore,
the  remainder  of  the  prosecutor’s  closing  argument  need  not  be  discussed.
  
Concurring  opinion  at  3.   However,  as  shown  in  part  VII,  the  prosecutor’s
entire  closing  argument,  including  the  prosecution’s  argument  that  Respondent
maintained  eye  contact  with  jurors  because  he  heard  during  voir  dire  that  such
conduct  is  indicative  of  credibility,  is  part  and  parcel  of  the  prosecutor’s
argument  that  Respondent  benefitted  from  being  at  trial.   Moreover,  inasmuch
as  the  case  is  remanded  for  retrial,  this  issue  must  be  addressed  to  avoid  a
similar  argument  being  raised  at  the  new  trial.

A.
 
The prosecutor’s closing argument built upon the
 
contention that Respondent was less credible because of his
 
attendance. Immediately after stating that Respondent
 “benefitted” from his presence by hearing the witnesses, the
 prosecutor continued, “[w]hat’s important about that[, i.e.,
 Respondent’s presence,] is . . . [that] he heard [] voir-dir[e]”
 where allegedly it was mentioned that a witness appears credible
 by maintaining eye contact with the jurors. According to the
 prosecutor, although Respondent supposedly “look[ed] each one of
 [the members of the jury] in the eye[,]” and appeared
 “sincere[,]” Kepa and Kapena, who had “never testified before[]”
 and were “nervous” and “inexperienced testifiers,” actually “told
 it like it was.” The prosecutor differentiated Respondent from
 Kepa and Kapena, suggesting that Respondent may have appeared
 “sincere” because of information gained through other witnesses’
 testimony and voir dire.
26 By contrasting Respondent from other
 
26 The  concurrence  characterizes  the  voir  dire  argument  as  made  “in 
the  context  of  a  larger  argument  regarding  the  credibility  of  the  witnesses,
and  in  particular,  their  demeanor  while  testifying.”   Concurring  opinion  at 
3-4.   According  to  the  concurrence,  the  prosecutor  “sought  to  dispel  the
notion  that  the  jurors  should  accordingly  find  [Respondent’s]  testimony
credible,  by  (1)  suggesting  that  [Respondent]  may  have  testified  in  that
manner  in  order  to  appear  sincere,  and  (2)  comparing  [Respondent’s]  demeanor
on  the  stand  to  that  of  the  State’s  witnesses.”   Id.  at  4.   But,  according  to 
the  prosecutor,  Respondent  purportedly  adopted  a  sincere  “manner”  because  he 
was  present  when  jurors  identified  such  a  “manner”  as  credible.   Likewise,  the 
“comparison”  that  Respondent  exhibited  a  false  appearance  of  sincerity  because
he  had  been  present  throughout  the  proceedings,  whereas  Kapena  and  Kepa
appeared  nervous  due  to  the  fact  that  they  had  never  testified  before  and  had
not  been  present,  improperly  made  “[Respondent’s]  presence  at  trial  an
automatic  burden  on  his  credibility.”   Mattson,  122  Hawai'i  at  323,  226  P.3d 
at  493  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted).   Thus,  it  is  plain
that  the  voir  dire  reference  improperly  relies  on  Respondent’s  presence.  
33
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
witnesses because of his trial presence, the prosecutor assailed
 
Respondent’s exercise of his constitutional rights, and
 “disregard[ed] the truth-seeking purpose of a trial” inasmuch as
 the “generic accusations of tailoring d[id] not aid the jury in
 any way in determining whether [Respondent] . . . tailored his
 testimony or simply related a true version of the events.”
27
 
Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 326, 226 P.3d at 496. Respondent’s 
“version of the events,” id., was automatically discredited to
 the extent that it was “tied only to [his] presence” in the
 courtroom[,] Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 77 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting,
 joined by Souter, J.). 
B.
 
Immediately after arguing that Kapena and Kepa were
 
believable whereas Respondent was not, the prosecutor discussed
 the standard jury instruction on witness credibility, stating,
 “But the fact of the matter is that [the jury may consider] the
 
27 The  concurrence  maintains  that  the  “truth-seeking  function[]”  of
 
the  jury  was  furthered  by  “focusing  the  jury’s  attention  on  .  .  .
[Respondent’s]  demeanor[,]”  and  providing  an  explanation  for  Respondent’s
 
demeanor  “based  on  more  than”  his  presence  throughout  trial.   Concurring
 
opinion  at  5.   Respectfully,  the  concurrence  provides  no  authority  for  its
 
statement.   Insofar  as  the  prosecutor’s  explanation  for  Respondent’s  demeanor
was  based  purely  on  Respondent’s  attendance  at  trial,  it  is  difficult  to
discern  how  that  function  is  furthered.   To  reiterate,  “[a]  trial  ideally  is  a
 
search  for  the  truth,”  but  that  search  is  not  advanced  when  a  prosecutor
accuses  a  defendant  during  closing  argument  of  tailoring  his  testimony  based
on  his  presence,  inasmuch  as  a  jury  is  not  aided  thereby  in  sorting  the
“guilty  from  the  innocent[,]”  or  in  evaluating  the  “defendant’s
 
credibility[.]”   Portuondo,  529  U.S.  at  77  (Ginsburg,  J.,  dissenting,  joined
 
by  Souter,  J.).   Additionally,  in  the  instant  case,  the  jury  was  not  aided  in
determining  whether  Respondent  was  guilty  or  innocent,  and  could  not  “measure
 
[Respondent’s]  credibility  by  evaluating  .  .  .  [his]  response  to  the
accusation  [of  tailoring],  for  the  broadside  [was]  fired  after  the  defense
ha[d]  submitted  its  case[,]”  inasmuch  as  the  statement  came  during  closing
 
arguments.   Id.  at  78  (Ginsburg,  J.,  dissenting,  joined  by  Souter,  J.)  (noting
that  statements  made  during  summation  were  improper  because  the  defendant  had
submitted  his  case  and  could  not  respond).
  
34
         
 
29
 The  prosecutor’s  reference  to  the  jury  instruction  did  not
 
mitigate  any  impropriety.   The  directive  in  the  instruction  that  the  jury  can
consider  the  demeanor  and  appearance  of  witnesses  was  undermined  by  the
prosecutor’s  following  warning  that  the  jury  should  not  “get  fooled  into  a
position  where  because  somebody  can  look  you  in  the  eye,  they  must  be  telling
(
continued...)
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
credibility of witnesses, [taking] into consideration all those
 
items such as their appearance and demeanor, their manner of
 testifying, . . . [and] the opportunity for acquiring
 information[.]”
28 The prosecutor then linked the jury
 
instruction with the previous argument that Respondent lacked
 credibility because he was present during voir dire by stating,
 “But don’t get fooled into a position where because somebody can
 look you in the eye, they must be telling the truth. If you know
 how to look somebody in the eye, you can still lie.”
29
 
28 Hawai'i  Jury  Instructions  Criminal  (HAWJIC)  §  3.09  states  as 
follows: 
It  is  your  exclusive  right  to  determine  whether  and  to
what  extent  a  witness  should  be  believed  and  to  give  weight
to  his  or  her  testimony  accordingly.   In  evaluating  the
weight  and  credibility  of  a  witness’s  testimony,  you  may
consider  the  witness’s  appearance  and  demeanor;  the
witness’s  manner  of  testifying;  the  witness’s  intelligence;
the  witness’s  candor  or  frankness,  or  lack  thereof;  the
witness’s  interest,  if  any,  in  the  result  of  this  case;  the
witness’s  relation,  if  any,  to  a  party;  the  witness’s
temper,  feeling,  or  bias,  if  any  has  been  shown;  the
witness’s  means  and  opportunity  of  acquiring  information;
the  probability  or  improbability  of  the  witness’s  testimony;
the  extent  to  which  the  witness  is  supported  or  contradicted
by  other  evidence;  the  extent  to  which  the  witness  has  made
contradictory  statements,  whether  in  trial  or  at  other
times;  and  all  other  circumstances  surrounding  the  witness
and  bearing  upon  his  credibility.
   
Inconsistencies  or  discrepancies  in  the  testimony  of  a
witness,  or  between  the  testimony  of  different  witnesses,
may  or  may  not  cause  you  to  discredit  such  testimony.   In
 
weighing  the  effect  of  inconsistencies  or  discrepancies,
whether  they  occur  within  one  witness’s  testimony  or  as
between  different  witnesses,  consider  whether  they  concern
matters  of  importance  or  only  matters  of  unimportant  detail,
and  whether  they  result  from  innocent  error  or  deliberate
falsehood.
 
(Emphasis  added.)
 
35
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In doing so, the prosecutor told the jury that even
 
though Respondent may have appeared truthful, Respondent should
 
not be believed because he had employed knowledge about the jury,
 that he had gained during voir dire. In essence, the prosecutor
 told the jury to “assess [Respondent’s] credibility in [the]
 light of this improper comment[,]” Hemingway, 528 A.2d at 748,
 thereby infringing on Respondent’s exercise of his right to
 testify, and “detract[ing] from, rather than ensur[ing,
 Respondent’s] ability to obtain a fair judgment[,]” id.
 
Following that assertion, the prosecutor’s comment,
 
“But John Cooprider tells it like it is[,]” again linked
 Respondent’s presence during voir dire and the testimony of other
 witnesses with Respondent’s lack of credibility, thereby
 “bolstering” Cooprider’s testimony. The prosecution’s assertion
 that Respondent’s credibility
30 must be viewed in the context of
 
his trial presence permeated her closing argument. The comments
 
thus “transform[ed Respondent’s] presence at trial from a
 
29(...continued)
the  truth.”   The  jury  instruction  served  only  as  a  platform  to  state  tha
Respondent’s  demeanor  was  feigned  based  on  information  received  during  v
dire.   Thus,  the  prejudicial  impact  of  the  argument  was  exacerbated,  not
mitigated,  by  the  reference  to  the  jury  instruction.

 It  is  established  that  a  prosecutor  may  attack  the  credibility  of 
a  defendant  who  chooses  to  testify.   Apilando,  79  Hawai'i  at  149,  900  P.2d  at
142  (“This  court  has  held  that,  when  a  defendant  takes  the  stand  to  testify,
his  or  her  credibility  can  be  tested  in  the  same  manner  as  any  other
witness.”).   In  that  regard,  “[t]he  credibility  of  a  witness  may  be  attacked
by  evidence  of  bias,  interest,  or  motive.”   Hawai'i  Rules  of  Evidence  Rule 
609.1(a)  (1993).   Thus,  a  prosecutor  may  challenge  the  defendant’s  credibility
by  commenting  on  evidence  of  bias,  interest,  or  motive.   But  here,  the
prosecutor  suggested  that  Respondent  was  not  believable  due  to  his  attendance
at  voir  dire  and  the  testimony  of  other  witnesses  at  trial.   Remarking  that 
Respondent  has  “benefitted”  from  being  at  trial,  including  voir  dire,  is  not  a
comment  on  any  evidence  of  bias,  interest,  or  motive.

credibility[.]” Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 76 (Ginsburg, J.,
 
dissenting, joined by Souter, J.).31
 
VIII.
 
A.
 
Petitioner’s third argument maintains the prosecutor’s 
argument that Respondent “tailored” his demeanor based on juror answers during voir dire was not improper. In this regard, the ICA concurrence concluded that the prosecutor’s argument was proper because it “was not merely a generic accusation of tailoring, but was based on [Respondent’s] actions after he witnessed the juror’s comments.” Walsh, 123 Hawai' i at 291, 231 
P.3d at 1008 (Fujise, J., concurring) (emphasis added). 
Ordinarily, juror statements during voir dire are not
 
evidence. See State v. Ashley, 22 So. 3d 1045, 1059 (La. Ct.
 
App. 2009) (“Jury voir dire is not evidence.”); see also United
 States v. Khoury, 901 F.2d 948, 955 (11th Cir. 1990) (the
 district court instructed the jurors “that the statements [by one
 juror] made during voir dire were not evidence and had nothing to
 
31
 According  to  the  concurrence,  Respondent  could  “rebut
 
[Petitioner’s]  argument  during  his  own  closing,  by  suggesting  that  his
demeanor  was  in  fact  sincere,  by  contrasting  it  to  the  demeanor  of  other
witnesses,  or  otherwise[,]”  concurring  opinion  at  5,  and  did  so,  id.  at  19.
 
But  such  a  response  would  only  confirm  the  legitimacy  of  the  generic  tailoring
argument  by  Petitioner.   The  inference  that  Respondent  was  less  credible  as  a
result  of  his  presence  is  the  very  inference  the  Portuondo  dissent  and  Mattson
condemned.   Although  Respondent  could  contrast  Respondent’s  demeanor  to  that
of  other  witnesses,  doing  so  would  do  nothing  to  counter  the  inference  planted
by  the  prosecution  that  Respondent’s  demeanor  was  shaped  because  of  his
presence,  whereas  other  witnesses  appeared  honest  because  they  had  not  been  in
attendance  throughout  trial.

32 The  concurrence  maintains  that  Respondent  had  the  responsibility 
of  requesting  a  transcript  of  voir  dire.   Concurring  opinion  at  4  n.1  (citing 
Hawai'i  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  (HRAP)  Rule  10(b)(1)(A)).   Respectfully,
first,  the  purported  statements  of  potential  jurors  were  not  offered  in
evidence  but  were,  nonetheless,  relied  on  by  the  prosecution  to  challenge
Respondent’s  truthfulness.   In  that  instance  the  prosecutor  incorrectly  sought
to  impeach  Petitioner  based  on  statements  not  in  evidence.
Second,  the  voir  dire  transcript  was  unnecessary  for  Respondent’s
 
argument.   HRAP  10(b)(1)(A)  provides  that  an  appellant,  here,  Respondent,  must
“request  .  .  .  a  []  transcript  of  such  parts  of  the  proceedings  as  the
appellant  [(Respondent)]  deems  necessary  that  are  not  already  on  file.”
 
(Emphasis  added.)   In  the  instant  case,  Petitioner  argued  on  appeal  that  the
ICA  should  disregard  Respondent’s  argument  concerning  voir  dire  inasmuch  as
Respondent  had  not  filed  a  transcript  of  the  voir  dire.   However,  Respondent
 
did  not  deem  the  transcript  of  voir  dire  “necessary,”  arguing  before  the  ICA

what was said by potential jurors with respect to eye contact. 
Inasmuch as the venire’s comments were not in evidence, the
 prosecutor impermissibly commented on matters outside the
 evidence. A prosecutor is allowed to “state, discuss, and
 comment on the evidence as well as to draw all reasonable
 inferences from the evidence.” State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 
304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (emphasis added); see State v.
 Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i 235, 253, 178 P.3d 1, 19 (2008) (“Although 
a prosecutor has wide latitude in commenting on the evidence

that  the  juror  statements  were  not  evidence  and  the  prosecutor’s  comments  on
Respondent’s  ability  “to  listen  to  the  jurors[]”  “did  not  connect  any  of  its
accusations  to  specific  evidence  of  tailoring  at  trial[,]”  but  instead,  made  a
 
general  accusation  “that  relied  on  innuendo  rather  than  evidentiary  support.”
Respondent  maintained  that  “the  substantive  content  of  voir  dire 
s  entirely  irrelevant”  inasmuch  as  the  voir  dire  transcript  would  “either 
upport  or  contradict  the  prosecutor’s  recollection  of  the  events,”  which,  in 
ither  event,  “would  not  affect  the  validity  of  [Respondent’s]  arguments.”
ccording  to  the  concurrence,  Respondent  took  the  “position[]”  that  he  did  not 
ispute  the  prosecutor’s  description  of  voir  dire,  a  position  “contrary”  to 
his  opinion’s  assertion  that  there  was  no  “verification”  of  what  was  said 
uring  voir  dire.   Contrary  to  the  concurrence’s  assertion,  Respondent’s
osition  was  not  that  he  “verif[ied,]”  concurring  opinion  at  4  n.1,  that  the
rosecution’s  characterization  of  voir  dire  was  correct,  but  that  he  deemed
oir  dire  to  be  entirely  irrelevant,  irrespective  of  whether  the  transcript
as  consistent  with  the  prosecutor’s  statement,  a  position  that  is  not
contrary”  to  the  statement  that  there  is  no  verification  of  what  was  said.  
he  ICA  majority  agreed  with  Respondent,  determining  that  it  was  “not  the  jury
oir  dire  itself,  but  the  prosecutor’s  comment  during  closing  argument
egarding  [Respondent’s]  right  to  witness  jury  voir  dire[]”  that  was  relevant,
nd  therefore,  the  record  of  jury  voir  dire  was  not  necessary.   Walsh,  123 i
seAdtdppvw“TvraHawai'i  at  288  n.2,  231  P.3d  at  1005  n.2. 
Finally,  the  concurrence  quotes  from  Ek  v.  Boggs,  102  Hawai'i  289,
292  n.3,  75  P.3d  1180,  1183  n.3  (2003),  a  civil  case  where  this  court  declined
to  address  the  petitioner-appellant’s  contention  that  a  circuit  court’s
“prefiling  order”  requiring  the  petitioner-appellant  to  obtain  court  approval
before  filing  future  pleadings  was  unsupported  by  the  evidence.   Concurring 
opinion  at  4  n.1.   This  court  merely  reiterated  that  it  would  not  address  that 
argument,  102  Hawai'i  at  292  n.3,  75  P.3d  at  1183  n.3,  inasmuch  as  petitioner-
appellant  failed  to  include  “a  transcript”  of  the  evidentiary  hearing  where 
“all  evidence  relevant”  to  the  prefiling  order  was  proffered,  HRAP  Rule 
10(b)(3).   In  the  instant  case,  Respondent  was  only  required  to  designate
parts  of  the  transcript  that  were  “necessary”  to  his  “point  of  appeal”  before 
the  ICA,  HRAP  10(b)(1)(A);  a  point  that  did  not  require  a  transcript  of  the
voir  dire.   See  Walsh,  123  Hawai'i  at  288  n.2,  231  P.3d  at  1005  n.2.

during closing argument, it is not enough that . . . his comments 
are based on testimony ‘in evidence’; his comments must also be ‘legitimate.’”) (Internal citation omitted.). A prosecutor’s comment on matters “outside the evidence” is improper. State v. 
Tuua, 125 Hawai' i 10, 14, 250 P.3d 273, 277 (2011) (holding that, 
the prosecutor’s remarks, hypothesizing on the consequences of the verdict, were improper because they commented on matters outside the evidence adduced at trial). Here, the prosecutor discussed statements by potential members of the jury elicited during voir dire that she did not offer in evidence and, thus, did not permissibly “state, discuss, and comment” on what was in evidence. Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209. 
A defendant’s right to be present during voir dire is 
analogous to a defendant’s right to be present during testimony of witnesses, and, thus, a defendant’s mere presence during voir dire cannot be used against the defendant to attack his credibility. Cf. Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 314, 226 P.3d at 484 
(noting that it is improper to allow a defendant’s presence at trial to be used as an attack on his credibility). Mattson 
allows a prosecutor to comment on a defendant’s presence in connection with “specific evidence”
33 that the defendant tailored 
33
 The  concurrence  argues  that  Mattson  did  not  state  that  only
 
evidence  “which  is  noted  in  the  record”  can  be  used  to  make  a  proper  tailoring
argument,  and  therefore,  it  is  proper  to  refer  to  a  defendant’s  demeanor  or
jury  statements,  even  if  they  are  not  in  the  record.   Concurring  opinion  at  13
 
n.4  (emphasis  omitted).   However,  in  Mattson,  the  “specific  evidence”  that  was 
“adduced  at  trial”  was  undeniably  in  the  record.   Mattson,  122  Hawai'i  at  314,
226  P.3d  at  484;  see  id.  at  314,  317  n.4,  320,  226  P.3d  at  314,  487  n.4.,  490
(noting  that  the  testimony  of  the  witnesses  was  “evidence  adduced  at  trial”;

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
his testimony to the evidence. Id. at 327, 226 P.3d at 497. In
 
this case, the prosecutor argued that Respondent shaped his
 
demeanor to appear truthful to the jury, based on statements made
 by potential jurors regarding credibility.
34 However, inasmuch
 
as the statements were not in evidence, they could not be relied
 
35
 on as “specific evidence”  to support the contention that the
defendant engaged in tailoring.
36 As with respect to testimony,
 
33(...continued)
stating  that  the  911  tape  was  “admitted  into  evidence,  [and]  was  played  for
the  jury  at  trial,  but  was  not  simultaneously  transcribed  into  the  record”;
and  explaining  that  the  prosecutor  argued  that  the  defendant  sat  “through  the
 
evidence”).   Respectfully,  if  evidence  of  a  specific  nature  is  not  in  the
record,  it  would  be  impossible  for  an  appellate  court  to  review  whether  there
was  specific  “evidence”  of  tailoring.
  
34 With  all  due  respect,  the  concurrence’s  argument  that  the  voir 
dire  remark  in  the  instant  case  is  “similar”  to  the  argument  that  was 
permitted  in  Mattson  is  incorrect.   Concurring  opinion  at  19.   To  reiterate, 
the  Mattson  prosecutor  referred  to  several  items  of  “specific  evidence,”  in 
arguing  that  the  defendant  tailored  his  testimony  to  the  evidence  presented.  
122  Hawai'i  at  327,  226  P.3d  at  497.   Contrastingly,  the  prosecutor  herein  did
not  refer  to  any  evidence  suggesting  that  Respondent  actually  shaped  his
demeanor  to  conform  to  supposed  juror  statements,  but  only  referred  to  his
presence  during  voir  dire  as  being  the  reason  for  the  alleged  tailoring.  
35 The  concurrence  agrees  that  the  voir  dire  statements  are  not  in 
evidence,  concurring  opinion  at  13,  but  maintains  that  in  the  instant  case  the
statements  regarding  eye  contact  are  not  a  “type”  of  information  that  needed 
to  be  entered  into  evidence  insofar  as  they  “derive[]  from  common  knowledge 
and  experience[,]”  to  which  the  prosecutor  can  “refer”  in  summation,  id.  at 
15-17.   With  all  due  respect,  eye  contact  alone  as  a  measure  of  credibility  is
not  at  issue  in  this  case.   What  is  at  issue  is  the  prosecutor’s  argument  that
Respondent  lacked  credibility  because  his  allegedly  credible  demeanor  was
derived  from  his  presence  at  trial  during  which  he  supposedly  heard  jurors
refer  to  credibility  traits  and  had  mimicked  those  traits.   In  that  regard,
the  prosecutor  employed  voir  dire  statements  regarding  eye  contact  as  evidence
that  Respondent  had  an  advantage  that  he  gained  solely  from  his  presence.   The 
prosecutor’s  attack  on  Respondent’s  credibility  due  to  his  presence  is  at
issue,  not  any  “common  knowledge”  of  the  jurors.   Additionally,  Mattson
requires  that,  in  seeking  to  attack  a  defendant’s  credibility  based  on  his
presence  during  voir  dire,  a  prosecutor  must  put  voir  dire  statements  in
evidence,  insofar  as  a  prosecutor  must  refer  to  specific  “evidence”,  i.e.,
voir  dire  statements,  indicating  a  defendant  engaged  in  tailoring  to  make  a
tailoring  argument.   122  Hawai'i  at  327,  226  P.3d  at  497.  
36
 The  concurrence  states  that  a  defendant’s  demeanor  on  the  stand  is
 
“information  which  both  the  jury  and  counsel  were  able  to  observe  at  trial  and
which  the  jury  can  appropriately  consider  as  evidence  in  its  deliberations[,]”
  
Concurring  opinion  at  7  (emphasis  added),  and  therefore  is  not  an  improper
(

42
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a generic tailoring argument is objectionable with respect to 
voir dire comments by the venire because there is “no evidence that [the] defendant ha[d] actually” changed his demeanor in response to such supposed comments. Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 336, 
226 P.3d at 506 (Acoba, J., dissenting, joined by Duffy, J.). 
Significantly, there is nothing in the record with 
respect to Respondent’s demeanor during his testimony, or any confirmation that Respondent looked the jurors “in the eye” or, if he did, the nature of the gaze. But more to the point, the “action” of looking at the jury when questioned on the witness stand in and of itself is not an unnatural or extraordinary act and, thus, is “‘conduct as consistent with innocence as with guilt[.]’” Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 326, 226 P.3d at 496 (quoting 
Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 79 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting, joined by Souter, J.)). To reiterate, “allowing a prosecutor . . . to invite the jury to convict on the basis of conduct as consistent with innocence as with guilt,” “would not only be improper, but would also disregard the truth-seeking purpose of trial[.]” Id. 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

subject  of  comment,  id.  at  8-9  (citing  many  cases  for  the  proposition  that  a
witness’  testimonial  demeanor  is  a  type  of  evidence  subject  to  proper
 
comment).   Of  course,  generally,  comment  on  testimonial  demeanor  is  entirely
 
proper.   See  infra  note  39.
 
However,  an  explanation  of  the  defendant’s  demeanor  simply  tied  to
his  observations  at  voir  dire  is  not  a  proper  ground  upon  which  to  attack
credibility.   The  concurrence  fails  to  cite  any  case  that  allows  a  prosecutor
to  argue  that  a  defendant  tailored  his  demeanor  to  conform  to  comments  made  by
the  venire  during  voir  dire.
  
37
 The  concurrence  asserts  that  this  opinion  “undercuts  the  basic
 
principle  of  Mattson”  inasmuch  as  the  prosecutor’s  voir  dire  remark  “could

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
It is also manifest that the prosecutor’s comments 
regarding Respondent’s manner of testifying transformed his 
presence at trial into an “automatic burden on his credibility,” Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 76, (Ginsburg, J., dissenting, joined by Souter, J.), inasmuch as attendance during voir dire was a reason advanced by the prosecution for the jury to treat his testimony as unbelievable. The prosecutor may permissibly cast doubt about the “substance” of a defendant’s testimony by referring to specific evidence suggesting that the defendant engaged in tailoring. Hemingway, 528 A.2d at 748. However, the prosecutor 
cannot ask the “jury to infer the defendant's lack of credibility from the manner in which he presented his testimony[,]” id., because that inference, “related only to the defendant's presence in the courtroom[,]” “burdens the constitutional rights of defendants,” specifically the right to be present at trial, Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 325-26, 226 P.3d at 495-96. Here, the 
inference that Respondent was not credible was not drawn from testimony, but from his rightful presence during voir dire.

have  aided  a  reasonable  juror  in  assessing  [Respondent’s]  credibility  by
providing  an  explanation  for  [his]  demeanor  on  the  stand.”   Concurring  opinion 
at  19-20.   But  because  Respondent’s  eye  contact  is  conduct  “as  consistent  with 
innocence  as  with  guilt,”  Mattson ,  122  Hawai'i  at  326,  226  P.3d  at  495
(internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted),  the  prosecutor  could  not
unfairly  encumber  Respondent’s  right  to  be  present  by  urging  the  jury  to
construe  the  ambiguity  against  Respondent.   Portuondo,  529  U.S.  at  77
(Ginsburg,  J.,  dissenting,  joined  by  Souter,  J.).   Respectfully,  it  is  the 
concurrence  that  misapplies  Mattson .   The  argument  proffered  by  the  prosecutor
does  not  relate  to  anything  other  than  Respondent’s  demeanor  inferred  from  his
presence  throughout  trial. 
38
 The  concurrence  suggests  that  requiring  counsel  to  note  demeanor
 
on  the  record,  if  to  be  used  in  a  tailoring  accusation,  will  result  in

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Cf. Hemingway, 528 A.2d at 748 (holding as improper a
 
prosecutor’s generic tailoring argument that asked the jury to
 infer, without referring to any testimony, that the defendant
 lacked credibility because of the manner in which he presented
 his testimony). 
The ICA concurrence quoted People v. Edelbacher, 766
 
P.2d 1, 30 (Cal. 1989), for the proposition that “‘prosecutorial
 comment in argument on an accused’s courtroom demeanor . . . [was
 not prohibited where] the defendant has testified and put his
 credibility in issue.’” Walsh, 123 Hawai' i at 291, 231 P.3d at 
1008 (Fujise, J., concurring (ellipsis and brackets in
 original)). In that case, the prosecutor stated during summation
 that the defendant, while testifying, did not “act emotionally,
 [the jury] saw him sitting on the witness stand, he didn’t have
 any emotion.” 766 P.2d at 30. The California court concluded
 that “[c]omment on a defendant’s demeanor as a witness is clearly
 
38(...continued)
“additional  interruptions”  during  trial  by  counsel  seeking  to  note  for  the
record  a  witness’s  demeanor,  and  asserts  that  “some  non-verbal  cues”  are  “not 
susceptible  to  verbal  description.”   Concurring  opinion  at  11.   If  the 
argument  is  tied  to  a  purported  advantage  the  defendant  gained  via  his
presence  at  trial,  the  argument  implicates  the  defendant’s  constitutional
rights,  which  predictably  may  be  raised  on  appeal.   In  that  regard,  the
prosecution  is  free  to  choose  to  note  the  specific  demeanor  for  the  record  or
not,  (as  it  would  with  respect  to  any  evidence),  knowing  that  the  matter
potentially  may  be  an  issue  for  appeal.   As  to  “additional  interruptions”  from 
litigators  and  the  courts,  it  appears  that  litigators  and  the  courts
frequently  and  correctly  note  behavior  in  the  record  without  considering  these
to  be  significant  “interruptions.”   See  State  v.  Kiese,  No.  29792,  2011  WL
682258,  at  *4  (App.  Feb.  25,  2011),  cert.  accepted  (July  29,  2011)  (“Your
Honor,  if  the  record  will  reflect  the  witness  is  shaking  his  head.”);  see  also
In  re  Doe,  108  Hawai'i  144,  149,  118  P.3d  54,  59  (2005)  (“Let  the  record
reflect  that  [the  court  is]  looking  at  the  letter[.]”);  Schutter  v.  Soong,  76
Hawai'i  187,  191-92,  873  P.2d  66,  70-71  (1994)  (“And  the  record  will  reflect,
[counsel],  that  you  are  yelling  at  the  court.”).   Finally,  if  “non-verbal 
cues”  are  not  subject  to  verbal  description,  it  is  unclear  how  the  prosecution
could  verbally  discuss  such  cues  during  closing  argument  to  the  jury.

proper[.]” Id.39 However, Edelbacher did not involve any
 
argument that the defendant was incredible because his demeanor
 
resulted from the exercise of his right to be at trial. Because
 Edelbacher did not connect any comment on the defendant’s
 demeanor with the defendant’s presence during trial, it has no
 bearing on the issue here.

B.
 
As recounted, Petitioner argues that the prosecutor’s
 
reminder to the jury of the standard instruction on evaluating
 witness testimony during her “eye contact” argument was proper. 
However, that argument is unavailing because the standard jury
 instruction on witness testimony did not counteract the improper
 inference that Respondent was less credible because of his
 
39 Similar  to  the  ICA  concurrence  in  Walsh,  the  concurrence  maintains
 
that  counsel  may  comment  on  a  criminal  defendant’s  demeanor  while  on  the
stand,  citing  numerous  cases  that  involve  comment  on  a  testifying  defendant’s
demeanor.   Concurring  opinion  at  7-10.   As  noted,  that  general  proposition  is
 
not  disputed  in  the  instant  case.   Additionally,  the  cases  cited  by  the
concurrence  are  plainly  distinguishable  because  they  do  not  involve  any
argument  that  the  defendant’s  demeanor  resulted  from,  or  was  tied  to,  being  at
trial.   For  example,  Patty  v.  State,  6  So.  2d  399,  400  (Ala.  1942),  involved
the  determination  that  the  prosecutor’s  characterization  of  the  defendant  as  a
“hard  man  to  get  along  with”  who  had  a  “high  temper”  and  “bad  disposition”  was
 
based  on  the  “appearance  of  the  defendant  as  a  witness  in  his  own  behalf”  and
 
“was  a  proper  observation  and  the  subject  of  argument  to  the  jury.”   However,
 
the  prosecutor  did  not  link  the  defendant’s  “bad  disposition”  or  “high  temper”
 
to  his  presence  during  trial.   Thus,  Patty,
40
 The  prosecution  may  comment  on  the  defendant’s  testimonial 
demeanor  at  trial.    and  the  cases  cited  by  the
concurrence,  have  no  relevance  to  the  case  at  hand.

testimony  was  properly  in  evidence  by  the  mere  fact  that  it  was  a  part  of  his
sworn  testimony.”);  contra  State  v.  Smith,  91  Hawai'i  450,  460,  984  P.2d  1276,
1286  (App.  1999)  (“Unless  and  until  [the  defendant’s  non-testimonial]  reaction
during  the  trial  was  lawfully  introduced  as  evidence,  it  was  not  a  proper
subject  for  argument  to  the  jury.”).

presence, inasmuch as the instruction “made no mention of the
 
prosecutor’s accusations of tailoring.” Daniels, 861 A.2d at
 
821. 
Because the prosecutor argued Respondent’s trial
 
presence when referring to the instruction, the jury could draw
 the conclusion that Respondent’s “means and opportunity of
 acquiring information,” as stated in the instruction, see supra
 note 27, included his presence throughout the trial. Similarly,
 in Daniels, the defendant failed to object to the prosecutor’s
 improper tailoring comments during summation. 861 A.2d at 810. 
After the prosecutor’s summation, the trial court instructed the
 jury it may consider, among other things, a witness’s “means of
 obtaining knowledge of facts to which [he] testified,” when
 judging the credibility of that witness. Id. at 812. Although
 
the instruction was not “intended to signal to the jury that
 defendant’s presence during trial was among the potential sources
 of his testimony[,]” the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that the
 charge did not cure the prosecutor’s improper remarks. Id. 
According to that court, the trial court’s failure to give an
 adequate curative instruction was plain error that “raised a
 reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result
 it otherwise might not have reached.” Id. (internal quotation
 
marks and citation omitted). 
The court in the instant case also told the jury,
 
albeit prior to the closing arguments, that the jury may consider
 
47
         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the “witness’[s] means and opportunity of acquiring
 
information[,]” when assessing credibility. Because the jury was
 instructed to consider a witness’s “means” and “opportunity” of
 obtaining information, the charge “did not cure the prosecutor’s
 comments.” Id. In light of the standard instruction on witness
 
testimony, and to mitigate what may be a jury’s “natural and
 irresistible” inclination to “have in mind and weigh in the
 balance” that the defendant heard the testimony of others who
 preceded him, Portuondo, 529 U.S. at 67-68, “instructions that
 explain the necessity, and the justifications, for the
 defendant’s attendance at trial[]” should be given whenever the
 defendant testifies to inform the jury that the defendant had a
 right and legal duty to be present at trial, id. at 76 (Stevens,
 J. concurring, joined by Breyer, J.) (explaining that states and
 trial judges have the power to provide juries with such
 instructions).
41
 
41 The  concurrence  maintains  that  such  an  instruction  should  be  given 
only  when  the  defense  requests  it,  because  where  the  prosecutor  does  not  make
tailoring  arguments,  the  instruction  “would  needlessly  emphasize  to  the  jury
that  the  defendant’s  presence  at  trial  creates  a  tactical  advantage.”  
Concurring  opinion  at  22.   However,  if  it  is  “natural”  for  a  jury  to  draw 
“adverse  inferences  from  a  defendant’s  presence[,]”  Portuondo,  529  U.S.  at  84
(Ginsburg,  J.,  dissenting,  joined  by  Souter,  J.),  the  jury  must  be  “instructed 
not  to  draw  [such  inferences,]”  id.  at  84-85  (emphasis  added),  in  order  that
the  jury’s  understanding  of  the  trial  process  is  a  correct  one.   Furthermore,
this  court  has  rejected  similar  assertions  that  instructions  be  given  at  the
behest  of  the  parties’  “tactical  or  strategic  reasons[.]”   State  v.  Haanio,  94 
Hawai'i  405,  414,  16  P.3d  246,  255  (2001)  (rejecting  the  assertion  that  a
lesser-included  offense  instruction  should  be  given  only  upon  request).   A 
contrary  approach  “impairs  the  truth  seeking  function  of  the  judicial 
system[,]”  id.,  because  juries  may  improperly  have  in  mind  and  weigh  in  the
balance  a  defendant’s  presence  when  assessing  “criminal  liability”  in  the 
absence  of  such  an  instruction.   Id.  
Moreover,  “the  trial  courts,  not  the  parties,  have  the  duty  and
ultimate  responsibility  to  insure  that  juries  are  properly  instructed[.]”   Id.
 
at  415,  16  P.3d  at  256.   Party  “tactics”  must  give  way  to  the  “broader

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Additionally, in Daniels the trial court instructed the 
jury that “[a]ny arguments, statements, remarks in the opening or 
summations of counsel are not evidence and must not be treated by you as evidence.” 861 A.2d at 812. The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that “[t]his charge properly reminded the jury to differentiate argument from evidence, but the court made no mention of the prosecutor’s accusations of tailoring[,]” and, therefore, the charge “did not cure the prosecutor’s [tailoring] comments.” Id. In the instant case, the jury was similarly 
instructed that “[s]tatements or remarks made by counsel are not evidence.”
42 Likewise, as in Daniels, this instruction would not 
remedy the lack of a curative instruction. See State v. 
Espiritu, 117 Hawai' i 127, 143-44, 176 P.3d 885, 901-02 (2008) 
(noting that the failure to correct a prosecutor’s misstatement of the law in final argument may result in reversal of the defendant’s conviction). 
In Daniels, because the failure to give an adequate
 
curative instruction amounted to plain error, the case was
 remanded for a new trial. 861 A.2d at 810. Similarly, as a jury

255;  cf.  State  v.  Pond,  118  Hawai'i  452,  467,  193  P.3d  368,  383  (2008)
(holding  that,  the  requirement  that  the  parties  provide  reasonable  notice
before  trial  of  the  evidence  intended  to  be  introduced  at  trial  of  other 
crimes,  wrongs,  or  acts,  “protects  parties  and  the  jury  trial  system  from
falling  prey  to  opposing  counsel’s  trial  tactics  and  strategies  that  do  not
promote  a  fair  trial”).   Finally,  requiring  the  instruction  potentially
precludes  future  error,  such  as  the  error  that  occurred  in  the  instant  case. 
42
 See  HAWJIC  3.03,  which  states  in  part  that  “[s]tatements  or
 
remarks  made  by  counsel  are  not  evidence.   You  should  consider  their  arguments
to  you,  but  you  are  not  bound  by  their  recollections  or  interpretations  of  the
evidence.”
  
49
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
may draw the improper and unreasonable inference that a defendant
 
who testified may lack credibility simply because the defendant
 was present at trial, such an instruction is warranted whenever a
 defendant testifies.
43 Hence, the jury should be instructed that
 
a defendant has a constitutional right to be present throughout
 trial and while other witnesses are testifying, and that the jury
 must not draw any unfavorable inference regarding the credibility
 of the defendant’s testimony simply on the basis of the
 defendant’s presence at trial.
44 Consequently, on remand, if
 
Respondent testifies, the court must give the jury such an
 instruction.
45
 
43 The  requirement  of  such  an  instruction  is  also  a  salutary  one 
inasmuch  as  a  defendant  charged  with  a  felony  is  obligated  to  be  present  at
all  stages  of  trial,  including  “the  impaneling  of  the  jury.”   HRPP  Rule  43(a).
HRPP  Rule  43  compounds  the  burden  placed  on  the  right  to  testify.   In  the 
absence  of  an  instruction,  mandated  presence  by  court  rule  becomes  a  detriment
to  a  defendant  because  the  prosecution  is  otherwise  free  to  impugn  a
defendant’s  credibility  should  he  choose  to  testify.   See  Mattson ,  122  Hawai'i 
at  345,  226  P.3d  at  515  (noting  that  HRPP  Rule  43  “compounds  the  burden” 
placed  “on  the  right  of  confrontation[,]”  and  mandated  presence  would 
otherwise  be  a  detriment  to  a  defendant). 
44 In  that  regard,  “[o]nce  all  the  evidence  has  been  presented,  it 
becomes  the  court’s  fundamental  duty  to  properly  instruct  the  jury  on  the
law[.]”   Montalvo  v.  Lapez,  77  Hawai'i  282,  291,  884  P.2d  345,  354  (1994).  
Indeed,  as  the  “sole  source  of  all  definitions  and  statements  of  law 
applicable  to  an  issue  to  be  resolved  by  the  jury[,]”  the  court  has  the  duty
“to  see  to  it  that  the  case  goes  to  the  jury  [sic]  in  a  clear  and  intelligent
manner,  so  that  they  may  have  a  clear  and  correct  understanding  of  what  it  is
they  are  to  decide[.]”   State  v.  Hoey,  77  Hawai'i  17,  38,  881  P.2d  504,  525
(1994)  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted).  
45
 Other  jurisdictions  have  required  that  an  instruction  regarding
 
presence  be  given.   See  State  v.  Rose,  622  A.2d  78,  79  (Me.  1993)  (explaining
to  the  jury,  after  defense  counsel  objected  to  the  prosecutor’s  improper
tailoring  questions  asked  of  the  defendant  on  cross  examination,  that  the
defendant  had  “an  absolute  legal  right  afforded  all  defendants  by  law  .  .  .  to
be  present  through  the  entire  trial”);  Elberry,  645  N.E.2d  at  43  (instructing
the  jury  that  the  “defendant,  who  was  a  witness  in  this  case,  was  here  during
the  testimony  of  other  witnesses,  but  he’s  got  every  right  to  be  here,”  and
 
“there  is  nothing  untoward  about  the  defendant  being  present  when  other
witnesses  are  testifying”);  see  also  Hemingway,  528  A.2d  at  748  (stating  that
a  cautionary  instruction  to  disregard  the  improper  tailoring  remarks  was

50
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Our holding does not hamstring the prosecution’s
 
ability to comment directly on the evidence presented. In that
 
regard, the prosecution is free to refer to the specific
 inconsistencies and contradictions in a defendant’s testimony or
 with other evidence, without referring to his presence at trial. 
Even in cases where there are no inconsistencies, the “close or
 perfect symmetry between a defendant’s testimony and other
 witnesses’ testimony, or other evidence of tailoring, may prompt
 the jury’s scrutiny.” Daniels, 861 A.2d at 820. Prosecutors may
 
already cite to specific facts indicating a defendant’s lack of
 trustworthiness; there is no reasonable justification for placing
 a tailoring burden on testimony. 
IX.
 
Petitioner’s third argument maintains the prosecutor’s
 
comment that Respondent looked the jury in the eye was “an
 attempt by [the prosecutor] to discredit [Respondent] by the
 manner in which [Respondent] testified.” (Emphasis in original.) 
But, as indicated supra, such a comment was improper because the
 suggestion that Respondent’s demeanor was fashioned to conform
 with comments heard during voir dire amounted to an attack on
 Respondent’s credibility on the basis of his trial attendance. 
Furthermore, comment on the “manner” of testifying that
 
rests on the defendant’s being at trial should be prohibited. 
See Hemingway, 528 A.2d at 748. In Hemingway, the defendant,
 
45(...continued)
n
ecessary).

 
51
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
while testifying, gave two versions of the incident at issue, one
 
that conformed to the testimony of a witness who had previously
 testified, and one that differed. In closing argument, the
 prosecutor stated that the defendant had “the opportunity, unlike
 any other witness, to sit here and hear all the other
 evidence[,]” had a chance to “fill in gaps[,]” and “modify
 testimony[,]” and urged the jury, upon review of the evidence, to
 “come back with a guilty verdict.” Id. at 747 (emphasis added). 
The Vermont court noted that the prosecutor could have commented
 on the defendant’s change in testimony, but the prosecutor “went
 beyond casting this doubt about the substance of the defendant’s
 testimony, and asked the jury to infer the defendant’s lack of
 credibility from the manner in which he presented his testimony.” 
Id. at 748 (emphases added). 
Because “[t]here was no testimony that the defendant
 
and [the witness] had collaborated, or that the defendant
 purposefully used the timing of his testimony to ensure his story
 coincided with that of [the witness,]” the inference that the
 defendant was not credible “was not drawn from the testimony, and
 was improper.” Id. Similarly, in the instant case, the
 
prosecutor’s comment on Respondent’s alleged manner in presenting
 his testimony, i.e., looking the jury in the eye, did nothing to
 “cast[] doubt on the substance” of Respondent’s testimony, but
 erroneously urged that Respondent was less believable as a result
 of having been at voir dire. Id. 
52
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
X.
 
Petitioner’s fourth argument, that the jury “likely did
 
not summarily conclude that [Respondent] tailored his testimony”
 
because the jury, during deliberations, inquired about
 Cooprider’s location during the incident, is unpersuasive. 
According to Petitioner, the question shows that the jury “did
 not simply dismiss [Respondent’s] testimony based upon an
 implication of tailoring, but properly weighed all of the
 evidence presented.” First, this jury question is not
 determinative of whether a prosecutor’s improper comments affect
 a defendant’s substantial rights. Second, the question does not
 indicate whether the jury disregarded the improper tailoring
 comments or not. Rather, the jury question may indicate that the
 jury was considering whether Cooprider was credible; or the jury
 could have been questioning whether Cooprider had the best view
 of the incident, as opposed to Stephanie or other witnesses. In
 either instance, the prosecutor’s comments on Respondent’s
 credibility would have weighed improperly in the balance of the
 jurors’ deliberations. 
XI.
 
Petitioner asserts in its fifth argument that, assuming
 
the prosecutor’s statements constituted misconduct, “the evidence
 against [Respondent]” was overwhelming and weighs against
 remanding for a new trial. To determine whether there is a
 reasonable possibility that the misconduct contributed to the
 
53
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conviction, this court considers (1) the nature of the conduct;
 
(2) the promptness of a curative instruction; and (3) the strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant.
46 
Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i at 252, 178 P.3d at 18. Upon review, all 
three factors weigh in favor of Respondent. 
A.
 
As to the first factor, the nature of the misconduct,
 
the effect of the misconduct is assessed.47 To reiterate, in
 
asserting that Respondent “benefitted” from hearing the testimony
 of other witnesses before he took the stand, and looked the
 jurors in the eye to establish credibility as a result of
 comments during voir dire, the prosecutor improperly argued that
 Respondent was not credible based on his presence throughout
 trial. When the misconduct attacks the credibility of the
 defendant, this factor has been weighed in favor of remanding for
 a new trial. For example, when the prosecutor “question[ed the
 defendant’s] credibility” by wrongly asking the defendant on
 cross examination about “unsworn, unimpeachable statements
 allegedly attributable” to his brother, this factor weighed in
 
46 Respondent’s  counsel  did  not  object  to  the  misconduct  at  trial.  
“If  defense  counsel  does  not  object  at  trial  to  prosecutorial  misconduct,  this
court  may  nevertheless  recognize  such  misconduct  if  plainly  erroneous.”  
Wakisaka,  102  Hawai'i  at  513,  78  P.3d  at  326.   “Plainly  erroneous”  misconduct 
is  that  which  affects  the  substantial  rights  of  the  defendant.   Id.   “In  order 
to  determine  whether  a  defendant's  substantial  rights  have  been  affected[,]
the  court  must  determine  ‘whether  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  the
error  might  have  contributed  to  conviction.’”   State  v.  Murray,  116  Hawai'i  3,
14  n.9,  169  P.3d  955,  966  n.9  (2007)  (quoting  State  v.  Gonsalves ,  108  Hawai'i 
289,  293,  119  P.3d  597,  601  (2005)).  
47
 Of  course,  as  stated  supra,  the  prosecution’s  summation  infringed
 
on  several  of  Respondent’s  constitutional  rights.
  
54
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
favor of remand. State v. Knight, 80 Hawai' i 318, 327, 909 P.2d 
1133, 1142 (1996). Similarly, when the prosecutor made the 
“illegitimate” and “unreasonable” argument that the defendant was guilty because of his post-arrest silence, “[t]he nature of the [prosecutor’s] conduct--the first factor--weigh[ed] in favor of granting [the defendant] a new trial.” Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i at 
254-55, 178 P.3d at 21. Also, when the prosecutor erroneously expressed her personal opinion as to the defendant’s guilt and credibility, this error weighed in favor of remand. State v. 
Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 660-62, 728 P.2d 1301, 1301-03 (1986). 
Additionally, the statements diverted the jury from its 
duty to decide the instant case on the evidence, by “invit[ing] the jury to convict on the basis of conduct as consistent with innocence as with guilt[.]” Mattson, 122 Hawai' i at 326, 226 
P.3d at 496 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Finally, the statements were also made during closing argument, a crucial part of trial.
48 The prosecutor argued that Respondent 
was not credible due to the exercise of his right to be present at trial, without referencing any specific evidence, “at a time when [Respondent] c[ould not] respond[,]” id., with any evidence. In sum, this factor plainly weighs in favor of Respondent. 
48
 The  prosecutor  did  state  that  Respondent  is  entitled  to  “hear  and
 
see”  the  witnesses.   However,  this  statement  was  undermined  by  the
prosecutor’s  comment  that  followed,  in  which  she  stated,  “But  with  that
 
becomes  the  fact  that  [Respondent]  benefitted  from  seeing  all  these
witnesses.”   The  reference  to  “hear  and  see”  served  only  as  the  starting  point
to  emphasize  that,  as  a  result  of  his  presence,  Respondent  was  not  to  be
believed.
  
55
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. 
As to the second factor, the nature of the curative 
instruction, the court gave no curative instruction. Thus, this 
factor also weighs in Respondent’s favor. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 
at 516, 78 P.3d at 329 (finding that this factor weighs in favor of the defendant when no curative instruction was given even though defense counsel did not object). 
C.
 
As to the third factor, the strength of the evidence, 
when a prosecution’s case against the defendant is not overwhelming but turns on the credibility of the defendant, it is likely that the error might have contributed to the conviction. See State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i 83, 97, 26 P.3d 572, 586 (2001) 
(noting that, when acquittal or conviction turned on whether the jury credited the defendant’s testimony or the state’s evidence, the evidence was not overwhelming); see also Marsh, 68 Haw. at 661, 728 P.2d at 1302 (stating that the pivotal issue was the credibility of witnesses and in such a case it cannot be concluded that “the prosecutor’s remarks had little likelihood of influencing this critical choice”). 
Cooprider testified that Respondent punched Kapena for
 
no reason, whereas Stephanie, Lucy, and Respondent testified that
 Respondent was attempting to flee and to defend himself from the
 attackers. As the prosecutor stated in closing argument, “[t]he
 
56
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
issue [was whether Respondent struck Kapena] in self-defense.”49
 
Cooprider’s testimony, standing alone, does not present
 
overwhelming evidence that there was no reasonable possibility
 that the “tailoring” error might have contributed to the
 conviction. 
A jury is instructed to evaluate the weight and
 
credibility of a witness’s testimony, considering, among other
 things, “the extent to which the witness is supported or
 contradicted by other evidence[.]” HAWJIC No. 3.09. At points,
 Cooprider’s testimony was contradicted by the testimony of the
 prosecution’s other witnesses, Kapena and Kepa, in addition to
 the testimony of Lucy, Stephanie, and Respondent. Cooprider
 testified that he noticed Kapena had his hands at his sides
 during his argument with Ilia. In contrast, Kapena testified
 that he “had [his] hands up[,]” and Lucy believed “the [male] had
 his hands like this (indicating), and he was explaining things,
 how would you talk to somebody, have your hands[]” in a
 “[y]elling kind of thing.” 
Cooprider indicated that Kapena was alone, whereas
 
Kapena and Kepa explained that they were together. Cooprider
 
49
 HRS  §  703-304  (1993),  the  self  defense  statute,  states  in
 
pertinent  part  as  follows:
 
Use  of  force  in  self-protection.  (1)  Subject  to  the
provisions  of  this  section  and  of  section  703-308,  the  use
of  force  upon  or  toward  another  person  is  justifiable  when
the  actor  believes  that  such  force  is  immediately  necessary
for  the  purpose  of  protecting  himself  against  the  use  of
unlawful  force  by  the  other  person  on  the  present  occasion.
  
(Emphasis  added.)
  
57
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
also said that Respondent was “completely by himself[,]” whereas
 
Kapena, Kepa, Lucy, and Stephanie testified that Respondent was
 near Stephanie and Lucy during the incident. 
Cooprider noted that Respondent came from a
 
“commotion.” However, Cooprider also testified that “security
 guards” were involved in the “commotion” and were “brushing
 people away[,]” “trying to get people to leave.” In contrast,
 Kapena testified that there were no security guards in the area. 
Lucy testified she did not see any bouncers in the parking lot. 
Stephanie testified that no security guard, bouncer, police
 officer, or any individual assisted them. 
Finally, Cooprider testified that Respondent “walked up
 
[to Kapena in a] calm, cool, collective[] [sic]” manner, which
 was seemingly inconsistent with the testimonies of Kapena, Kepa,
 Stephanie, and Respondent. Kapena confirmed that he recalled
 Respondent and Kala “wrestling on the ground.” According to
 Kapena, Respondent and Kala were “fighting.” Kepa stated that
 Respondent fought with Kala. Stephanie testified that
 Respondent, after being beaten in a corner, escaped and then fell
 “[s]teps away” from Ilia and Kapena, where he continued to be
 beaten while he was on the ground. According to Stephanie,
 Respondent “stumbled[,]” slipped out, and at that point, punched
 Kapena. Respondent testified that he was “crawl[ing] and
 stumbl[ing]” in an attempt to escape from his attackers. After
 he “crawled and stumbled” to the car, he “got up” and “just swung
 
58
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
blindly[]” because he “was getting attacked.” Cooprider also
 
testified that Respondent had no marks on him from the fight, but
 Stephanie testified that he had “bumps on his face[,]” big lumps
 on “the back of his head” and a “black and blue[]” mouth from the
 blows he had received before he struck Kapena.
 
Thus, Cooprider’s testimony concerning Respondent’s
 
demeanor and physical condition contrasted sharply with the
 circumstances related by the other witnesses. No one, not even
 Petitioner’s other witnesses, except Cooprider, testified that
 Respondent was “calm, cool, and collect[ed],” and had no marks on
 him from the altercation. Cooprider’s testimony was
 “contradicted by other evidence,” which raised an issue of
 whether his testimony was “worthy of belief.” See Black’s Law
 
Dictionary at 423 (defining credibility as “[t]he quality that
 makes something (a witness or some evidence) worthy of belief”). 
Finally, had the prosecutor not tied Respondent’s 
credibility to his presence at trial, the jury “may well have harbored a reasonable doubt,” Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i at 97, 26 P.3d 
at 586, of whether Petitioner had negated the defense of self defense. See State v. Van Dyke, 101 Hawai' i 377, 386, 69 P.3d 
88, 97 (2003) (“[O]nce the issue of self-protection is raised, the burden is on the prosecution to disprove the facts that have been introduced or to prove facts negativing the defense and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Quoting State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai'i 429, 431, 886 P.2d 766, 768 (App. 1994).)). Under the 
59
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
self defense statute, “the critical factor in determining whether
 
an actor’s conduct is justified is the actor’s state of mind or
 belief respecting facts and circumstances.” Supplemental
 Commentary on HRS § 703-300 (1993). HRS § 703-304(1), governing
 the defense of self defense, provides in relevant part that “the
 use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when
 
50
 the actor believes[ ] that such force is immediately necessary
for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful
 force by the other person on the present occasion.” (Emphasis
 added.) 
With respect to this defense, State v. Augustin, 101 
Hawai'i 127, 127, 63 P.3d 1097, 1097 (2002), noted that it was 
proper to instruct the jury to consider the defendant’s self-defense claim “from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in [the defendant’s] position under the circumstances of which [the defendant] was aware or as [the defendant] reasonably believed them to be[.]” In the majority’s view, that defendant may only be “charged with ‘knowledge’ of those ‘circumstances’ of which he or she is actually ‘aware.’” Id. at 128, 63 P.3d at 1098 (citing 
HRS § 702-206(2)(b) (1993)). Therefore, it is “error to judge the reasonableness of a defendant’s viewpoint based on circumstances ‘shown in the evidence’ but of which the defendant 
50
 HRS  §  703-300,  which  defines  “believes,”  states  that  “‘[b]elieves’
 
means  reasonably  believes[,]”  and  applies  the  “reasonable  man  standard  with
 
respect  to  justification  for  the  use  of  force  in  self  protection,  in  the
protection  of  property,  and  in  the  protection  of  others[,]”  Commentary  on  HRS

is not ‘aware.’” Id. (quoting State v. Pemberton, 71 Haw. 466,
 
477-78, 796 P.2d 80, 85 (1990)). Thus, a defendant’s belief as
 
to the surrounding circumstances of the incident is crucial to
 the defense.
 
In this regard, Respondent’s credibility was at the
 
crux of his defense. The jury must “consider the circumstances
 as [the defendant] subjectively believed them to be at the time
 he tried to defend himself.” Id. at 132, 63 P.3d at 1102
 
(brackets, quotation marks, and internal citation omitted). In
 doing so, of course, the jury is to decide whether the defendant
 was truthful about his subjective belief of the circumstances. 
Respondent testified he was aware that he was dazed, confused,
 stumbling, and under attack. He “swung blindly” “because he was
 getting attacked[.]” To determine whether it was “reasonable”
 for Respondent to act that way, the jury must assess Respondent’s
 credibility. 
Pacheco, 96 Hawai' i at 87, 26 P.3d at 576, where the 
defendant was charged with second degree escape, is instructive in this regard. There, the defendant attempted to run away from police officers, one of whom had allegedly “intimidated” the defendant in a previous encounter. Id. at 91, 26 P.3d at 580. 
The issue at trial was whether the defendant sought to escape as a means of avoiding custody, which would support the charge, or to avoid assault by the police officer, which would not support the charge. Id. at 97, 26 P.3d at 586.

As to the strength of the evidence, this court
 
“observe[d] that whether the prosecution succeeded in
 
establishing that [the defendant] possessed the requisite state
 of mind at the time he fled . . . hinged entirely upon whether
 the jury believed or disbelieved [the defendant’s] testimony and,
 thus, depended upon winning a credibility contest.” Id. at 96,
 
26 P.3d at 585. According to this court, 
had the jury believed [the defendant’s] testimony, it may
well have harbored a reasonable doubt as to whether [the
defendant] had possessed the state of mind requisite to
committing the offense of second degree escape. As such,
. . . we cannot say that the evidence against [the
defendant] was so overwhelming as to render the
[prosecutor’s] personal disparagements of him and vigorous
and improper attack on his credibility harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt .
 
Id. at 97, 26 P.3d at 586 (emphasis added). 
Similarly, in the instant case, but for the 
prosecutor’s “improper attack on his credibility[,]” id., the 
jury could have found that Respondent reasonably believed he was under continuous attack and acted to defend himself, raising a reasonable doubt as to whether Petitioner had disproved Respondent’s defense of self defense beyond a reasonable doubt. In short, like Pacheco, the evidence was not so overwhelming so as to overcome the prosecutor’s statements, which served to discredit Respondent and bolster the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses. Therefore, all three factors weigh in Respondent’s favor and there is a reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to the conviction. State v. Maluia, 
107 Hawai' i 20, 24, 108 P.3d 974, 978 (2005).
