NO. 29862
 
CERTIFIED QUESTION FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAI 'I 
(Case 1:08-cv-00525-HG-LEK) 
MARCH 29, 2010 
MOON, C.J., NAKAYAMA, DUFFY, AND RECKTENWALD, JJ.;
WITH ACOBA, J., DISSENTING
 
OPINION BY RECKTENWALD, J.
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants (collectively “Employees”) have 
been or currently are employed as banquet servers at the Defendants-Appellees Four Seasons Resort, Maui or Four Seasons Resort, Hualalai on the island of Hawai
'i. Employees filed a 
class action complaint against Defendants-Appellees1
 (hereinafter
collectively referred to as “Four Seasons”) in the United States District Court for the District of Hawai
'i (district court), and 
1
 Defendant-Appellee Four Seasons Resorts Limited operates the Four
Seasons Resort, Maui and Four Seasons Resort, Hualalai, which are both owned
by Defendant-Appellee MSD Capital.
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
subsequently filed an Amended Complaint. Employees claimed, 
inter alia, that Four Seasons violated Hawai 'i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 481B-142
 by retaining a portion of a mandatory “service
charge” collected at banquets and other events and by failing to
 notify customers that it was doing so. 
Four Seasons moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint,
 
arguing, inter alia, that Employees do not have standing to

 
assert their claims for monetary damages under HRS §§ 480-2(e)
 and 480-13, quoted infra, because they are not businesses,
 competitors, or consumers, and because they failed to adequately
 plead the effect of Four Seasons’ alleged actions on competition
 and therefore did not sufficiently allege antitrust injury.
 
On June 2, 2009, the district court
3
 certified the
following question pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 13 4
: 
2 HRS § 481B-14 (2008) provides:
 
Hotel or restaurant service charge; disposition.  Any
hotel or restaurant that applies a service charge for
the sale of food or beverage services shall distribute
the service charge directly to its employees as tip
income or clearly disclose to the purchaser of the
services that the service charge is being used to pay
for costs or expenses other than wages and tips of
employees.

 The Honorable Helen Gillmor, United States District Judge,
presided.

 HRAP Rule 13(a) states in pertinent part as follows: 
When a federal district or appellate court certifies
to the Hawai' i Supreme Court that there is involved in
any proceeding before it a question concerning the lawof Hawai' i that is determinative of the cause and that 
there is no clear controlling precedent in the Hawai' i 
-2­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Where plaintiff banquet server employees allege that
their employer violated the notice provision of H.R.S.
§ 481B-14 by not clearly disclosing to purchasers that
a portion of a service charge was used to pay expenses
other than wages and tips of employees, and where the
plaintiff banquet server employees do not plead the
existence of competition or an effect thereon, do the
plaintiff banquet server employees have standing under
H.R.S. § 480-2(e) to bring a claim for damages against
their employer? 
This court entered an order accepting this certified
 
question on June 12, 2009.
 
For the reasons set forth herein, we answer the
 
certified question as follows:
 
Employees are “any persons” within the meaning of HRS
 
§§ 480-1 and 480-2(e), quoted infra, and are within the category
 
of plaintiffs who have standing to bring a claim under HRS § 480­2(e) for a violation of HRS § 481B-14. 
However, based on the allegations contained in
 
Employees’ Amended Complaint, Employees have not sufficiently
 alleged the “nature of the competition” to bring a claim for
 damages against Four Seasons under HRS §§ 480-2(e) and 480-13(a)
 for a violation of HRS § 481B-14.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This factual background is based primarily upon the
 
information certified to this court by the district court, as
 well as the allegations contained within Employees’ Amended
 
judicial decisions, the Hawai' i Supreme Court may
answer the certified question by written opinion. 
-3­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Complaint. See TMJ Hawaii, Inc., v. Nippon Trust Bank, 113
 
Hawai'i 373, 374, 153 P.3d 444, 445 (2007) (in answering a 
certified question, this court relied upon the information
 
certified to the court by the district court and the facts set
 forth in the plaintiff’s amended complaint). 
Employees have all worked as food and beverage servers
 
for Four Seasons. Daryl Dean Davis, Mark Apana, Elizabeth Valdez
 Kyne, Earl Tanaka, and Thomas Perryman have worked at the Four
 Seasons Resort, Maui, and Deborah Scarfone has worked at the Four
 Seasons Resort, Hualalai on the Big Island. 
The Amended Complaint, which sought money damages,
 
alleged in relevant part  5
:
4. For banquets, events, meetings and in
other instances, the defendants add a preset service
charge to customers’ bills for food and beverage
provided at the hotels.
5. However, the defendants do not remit the
total proceeds of the service charge as tip income to
the employees who serve the food and beverages.
6. Instead, the defendants have a policy and
practice of retaining for themselves a portion of
these service charges (or using it to pay managers or
other non-tipped employees who do not serve food and
beverages).
7. The defendants do not disclose to the
 
hotel’s customers that the service charges are not
remitted in full to the employees who serve the food
and beverages.
8. For this reason, customers are misled into
believing that the entire service charge imposed by
the defendants is being distributed to the employees
who served them food or beverage when, in fact, a
smaller percentage is being remitted to the servers.
As a result, customers who would otherwise be inclined
 
5
 Employees’ Amended Complaint also included Counts II - V, in which
Employees’ alleged that Four Seasons’ conduct constituted intentional
interference with contractual relations and/or advantageous relations, breach
of implied contract, unjust enrichment, and unpaid wages pursuant to HRS §§
388-6, 10 and 11.
 
-4­6 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to leave an additional gratuity for such servers
frequently do not do so because they erroneously
believe that the servers are receiving the entire
service charge imposed by the defendants. 
. . . 
COUNT I
 
(Hawaii Revised Statutes, Sections 481B-14, 481B-4,
and 480-2[6])
 
The action of the defendants as set forth above

 
are in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes Section
 481B-14. Pursuant to Section 481B-4, such violation
constitutes an unfair method of competition or unfair
and deceptive act or practice within the meaning of
Section 480-2. Section 480-2(e) permits an action
based on such unfair methods of competition to be
brought in the appropriate court, and a class action
for such violation is permitted and authorized by
 
HRS § 480-2 (2008) provides: 
Unfair competition, practices, declared unlawful.  (a)
Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive
acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce are unlawful.
 
(b) In construing this section, the courts and
the office of consumer protection shall give due
consideration to the rules, regulations, and decisions
of the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts
 interpreting section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to
time amended. 
(c) No showing that the proceeding or suit
would be in the public interest (as these terms are
interpreted under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade
Commission Act) is necessary in any action brought
under this section. 
(d) No person other than a consumer, the
attorney general or the director of the office of
consumer protection may bring an action based upon
unfair or deceptive acts or practices declared
unlawful by this section.
(e) Any person may bring an action based on
unfair methods of competition declared unlawful by
this section.
 
HRS § 481B-4 (2008) provides:
 
Remedies. Any person who violates this chapter shall
be deemed to have engaged in an unfair method of
competition and unfair or deceptive act or practice in
the conduct of any trade or commerce within the
meaning of section 480-2.
 
-5­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Section 480-13[ 7
] and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of
 
Civil Procedure.   
 
On January 30, 2009, Four Seasons moved to dismiss the
 
Amended Complaint, arguing, inter alia, that Employees lacked
 
standing under HRS § 480-2(e) to bring a claim for unfair methods
 of competition because they are not businesses, competitors, or
 consumers. Four Seasons also asserted that Employees failed to
 properly plead the nature of the competition.
 
The district court held a hearing on the motion to
 
dismiss on March 24, 2009.  Following oral argument, Judge
 
Gillmor denied Four Seasons’ motion to dismiss with leave to
 
renew the motion following receipt of a ruling by this court with
 respect to the issue of standing of the Employees to bring the
 
action.  An order certifying the question was entered on June 2,
 
HRS § 480-13 (2008) provides:
 
Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery,
injunctions. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b)
and (c), any person who is injured in the person’s
business or property by reason of anything forbidden
or declared unlawful by this chapter:
 (1) May sue for damages sustained by the person,
and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the
plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less than $1,000
or threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained,
whichever sum is the greater, and reasonable
attorney’s fees together with the costs of suit;
provided that indirect purchasers injured by an
illegal overcharge shall recover only compensatory
damages, and reasonable attorney’s fees together with
the costs of suit in actions not brought under section
480-14(c); and
(2) May bring proceedings to enjoin the unlawful
practices, and if the decree is for the plaintiff, the
plaintiff shall be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees
together with the costs of suit.

 DISCUSSION
 
A. Introduction
 
1. Applicable Statutes
 
The Amended Complaint alleges that Four Seasons engaged
 
in unfair methods of competition in violation of HRS § 481B-14 by
 
withholding a portion of the service charge imposed on the sale
 of food and beverages at Four Seasons’ resorts without advising
 customers that it was doing so. In their Opening Brief,
 Employees argue that this conduct “leads customers to believe
 that the waitstaff are receiving a tip of 18-22% of the food and
 beverage bill and deters customers from leaving any additional
 gratuity . . . .” 
HRS § 481B-14 provides that: 
Any hotel or restaurant that applies a service charge
 
-7­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
for the sale of food or beverage services shall
distribute the service charge directly to its
employees as tip income or clearly disclose to the
purchaser of the services that the service charge is
being used to pay for costs or expenses other than
wages and tips of employees.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 481B-4, any person who violates
 
chapter 481B, including § 481B-14, “shall be deemed to have
 
engaged in an unfair method of competition and unfair or
 deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce
 within the meaning of section 480-2.” HRS § 480-2(a), which is
 virtually identical to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade
 Commission Act (FTCA), 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1),
8
 declares that any
“[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or
 practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.” 
Only consumers, the attorney general, or the director
 
of the office of consumer protection are authorized to bring an
 action based on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. HRS §
 480-2(d). Actions based on unfair methods of competition, on the
 other hand, are not so limited. Instead, HRS § 480-2(e) provides
 that “[a]ny person may bring an action based on unfair methods of
 
8 Section 5(a)(1) of the FTCA provides that “[u]nfair methods of
competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or
practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful.” 15 U.S.C. §45(a)(1). HRS § 480-2 “differs from section 5 of the FTCA in one essentialaspect - enforcement.” Hawai'i Med. Ass’n v. Hawai' i Med. Serv. Ass’n, 113 
Hawai'i 77, 109, 148 P.3d 1179, 1211 (2006). HRS § 480-2(e) provides a private
right of action with regard to unfair methods of competition claims, id.,while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sole authority to enforce theFTCA, see Robert’s Hawai' i Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., Inc., 91 
Hawai'i 224, 249, 982 P.2d 853, 878 (1999), superseded by statute, 2002 Haw.
Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17, as recognized in Hawai' i Med. Ass’n, 113 
Hawai'i at 107, 148 P.3d at 1209; Star Markets, Ltd. v. Texaco, Inc., 945 F.
Supp. 1344, 1346 (D. Hawai' i 1996). 
-8­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
competition declared unlawful by this section.” (emphasis
 
added).9 Furthermore, HRS § 480-13(a), which is similar to
 
section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a),10 provides that

“any person who is injured in the person’s business or property
 by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by [chapter
 480]: (1) [m]ay sue for damages . . . ; and (2) [m]ay bring
 proceedings to enjoin the unlawful practices[.]” 
2. The Parties’ Arguments

 
Employees allege that they have standing based on the
 
plain meaning of the relevant statutes, the legislative history
 of HRS §§ 481B-14 and 480-2(e), and relevant Hawai
'i and federal 
9 The availability of a private right of action for unfair methods
of competition in Hawai' i has changed over the last several years. In Ai v. 
Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., 61 Haw. 607, 612, 607 P.2d 1304, 1308-09 (1980),
overruled by Robert’s Hawai' i Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., Inc., 
91 Hawai' i 224, 982 P.2d 853 (1999), and Island Tobacco Co., Ltd. v. R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., 63 Haw. 289, 300-01, 627 P.2d 260, 268-69 (1981),overruled by Robert’s Hawai' i, this court held that HRS § 480-2 afforded
plaintiffs a private right of action for unfair methods of competition. InRobert’s Hawai' i, this court overruled Ai and Island Tobacco to the extent
that they held there existed such a private right and instead held that “thereis no private claim for relief under HRS § 480-13 for unfair methods ofcompetition in violation of HRS § 480-2.” 91 Hawai' i at 252, 982 P.2d at 881.
Thereafter, in 2002, the legislature amended HRS § 480-2 to add subsection (e)which makes clear there is such a private right. 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17. In Hawai' i Med. Ass’n v. Hawai' i Med. Services Ass’n, 113 
Hawai'i 77, 107, 148 P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006), this court held that “[w]e do not
believe the amendment ‘overruled’ Robert’s Hawai' i . . . but instead simply
provided a new right that did not previously exist.” 
10
 Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), provides:
 
(a) Amount of recovery; prejudgment interest
Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,
any person who shall be injured in his business or
property by reason of anything forbidden in the
antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . , and shall
recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney’s fee.
 
-9­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
law. Specifically, Employees argue that the plain meaning of
 
“any person” as found in HRS § 480-2(e), and as defined by HRS §
 480-1, does not limit standing to businesses, competitors or
 consumers, and that even if this court determines that the phrase
 “any person” is ambiguous, the legislative history of HRS § 480­2(e) demonstrates that “[e]ach one of the plaintiffs here
 qualifies as ‘any person’ under the law.”
11 Furthermore,
 
Employees argue that the legislative history of HRS § 481B-14
 “reflects a specific legislative intent to protect plaintiff food
 and beverage servers.” Additionally, Employees argue that based
 on the plain meaning of HRS §§ 480B-14 and 481B-4, “a violation
 of § 481 B-14 is ‘deemed’ by the language of the statute to be an
 unfair method of competition . . . and no further proof that such
 a violation is an [unfair method of competition] is required.” 
Finally, Employees argue that “[t]o the extent it is applicable,
 federal antitrust law supports the conferral of standing on
 plaintiffs.”
12
 

 Four Seasons counters that Employees “lack standing to
11 Employees also argue that a limited interpretation of “any person”
so as to exclude Employees “risks violation the equal protection clause of the
Hawaii Constitution (Article I, Section 5) because it requires the court to
deny the protection of Chapter 480 to employees, who may be [unfair methods of
competition] victims similarly situated to other ‘persons’ receiving
protection under the statute, without a reasonable basis.” Because we
 conclude that Employees fall within the definition of “any person,” we do not
need to address this argument. 
12
 Employees also contend that Employees can enforce HRS § 481B-14
through HRS §§§ 388-6, 10 and 11. However, this argument will not be
addressed because it is beyond the scope of the certified question. 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
bring their damages claims under HRS § 481B-14 as that statute is
 
currently written and based on the allegations (or lack thereof)
 in [their] Amended Complaint.” Specifically, Four Seasons argues
 that the legislative history of HRS § 481B-14 shows that it is
 not a wage and hour law intended to protect employees or create a
 labor standard,
13 but is instead “a consumer protection law
 
designed to prevent businesses from engaging in unfair and/or
 anticompetitive behavior.” Furthermore, Four Seasons argues that
 the broad “any person” language of HRS § 480-2(e) “should not be
 interpreted literally” and should instead be limited to
 businesses, competitors, or consumers
14
 based on the legislative
history of HRS § 480-2(e) and this court’s holding in Hawai 'i 
Medical Association v. Hawai 'i Medical Services Association, 113 
Hawai'i 77, 105, 148 P.3d 1179, 1212 (2006) (hereinafter “HMA”), 
as well as federal courts’ interpretations of section 4 of the
 
13 Four Seasons also argues that if HRS § 481B-14 “was intended to
create a wage claim for employees, it is strikingly - if not
unconstitutionally - vague. Among other things, it does not specify which
employees should be paid the service charge as tip income[,]” and “allows the
employer to pick any employee to receive the monies in any amount.”
This argument, however, does not relate to the issue of whether or
not employees have standing under HRS § 480-2(e) to bring a claim for damages
for a violation of HRS § 481B-14, but instead relates the merits of such a
claim. Accordingly, we do not address it here.
 
14
 At some points in its Answering Brief, Four Seasons also includes
references to “other market participants,” arguing that HRS § 480-2(e) islimited to businesses, competitors, consumers or “other market participants.”At oral argument, counsel for Four Seasons argued that “businesses” may bebroadly interpreted under this court’s holding in HMA to include groups suchas trade associations which are market participants, but did not furtherexplain what other entities may be considered to be “market participants,” seeMP3: Oral Argument, Hawai' i Supreme Court, at 39:37 - 40:01 (Jan. 21, 2010),
available at http://www.courts.state.hi.us/courts/oral_arguments/archive/oasc29862.html,other than indicating that employees are not, id. at 57:15 - 57:23. 
-11­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Clayton Act. Additionally, Four Seasons argues that both Hawai 'i 
and federal case law require that Employees plead the nature of 
the competition, and that this requirement must be satisfied even if a plaintiff alleges a per se violation of Hawai
'i antitrust 
law. 
 
As discussed below, Employees clearly qualify as “any

 
person” within the plain meaning of HRS §§ 480-1 and 480-2(e),
 and the legislative history of HRS § 480-2(e) is consistent with
 this interpretation. Contrary to Four Seasons’ assertions,
 standing to sue under HRS §§ 480-2(e) and 480-13(a) is not
 limited so as to preclude Employees from bringing suit. 
Moreover, both the plain language and legislative history of HRS
 § 481B-14 support the conclusion that Employees can bring claims
 for violations of HRS § 481B-14, as long as all other
 requirements of §§ 480-2(e) and 480-13(a) are met. 
Additionally, Employees have sufficiently alleged a
 
direct injury in fact to their “business or property” within the
 meaning of HRS § 480-13(a). However, Employees have failed to
 allege the “nature of the competition” in their Amended
 Complaint, which is required in order to bring a claim for
 damages based on Four Seasons’ alleged unfair methods of
 competition. 
B.	 Employees are “persons” within the meaning of HRS §§ 480-1
and 480-2(e), and have standing to bring a claim under HRS §
480-2(e) for a violation of HRS § 481B-14
 
-12­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1.	 Employees are “persons” for purposes of HRS §§ 480-1
and 480-2(e)
 
HRS § 480-2(e) provides that “any person” can sue for
 
unfair methods of competition, while HRS § 480-1 defines “person”
 
to include “individuals, corporations, firms, trusts,
 partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability
 partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships, limited
 liability companies, and incorporated or unincorporated
 associations, . . . .” Therefore, under the plain language of
 HRS §§ 480-1 and 480-2(e), Employees constitute “any person”
 within the meaning of § 480-1 because they are “individuals.” 
Since the language of §§ 480-1 and 480-2(e) is plain, clear, and
 unambiguous, the statute should be applied as written. See,
 
e.g., State v. Yamada, 99 Haw. 542, 553, 57 P.3d 467, 478 (2002)
 (“[i]nasmuch as the statute’s language is plain, clear, and
 unambiguous, our inquiry regarding its interpretation should be
 at an end”); Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Haw. 54, 67,
 905 P.2d 29, 42 (1995) (“[w]here the language of the statute is
 plain and unambiguous, our only duty is to give effect to its
 plain and obvious meaning”) (citation omitted).
 
However, even if the language of HRS §§ 480-2(e) and
 
480-1 is considered to be unclear or ambiguous and the
 legislative history of HRS § 480-2(e) is therefore examined, it
 confirms that “any person” is not limited to consumers,
 businesses, or competitors, and can in fact extend to Employees. 
-13­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS § 480-2(e) was enacted in 2002 in response to Roberts Hawai 'i 
School Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transportation Co., Inc., 91 
Hawai'i 224, 252, 982 P.2d 853, 881 (1999), superseded by 
statute, 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17, as recognized in HMA, 113 Hawai
'i at 107, 148 P.3d at 1209, in which 
this court held that “there is no private claim for relief under HRS § 480-13 for unfair methods of competition in violation of HRS § 480-2.” See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1118, in 2002 House 
Journal, at 1665 (noting that HRS § 480-2 was amended in response to a “1999 Supreme Court interpretation of section 480-2”). 
The “any person” language initially proposed for HRS
 
§ 480-2(e) never changed from the time the bill was first
 introduced as S.B. 1320 until it was signed into law as Act 229. 
Compare S.B. 1320, 21st Leg., Reg. Sess. (2002) with 2002 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17.  Most of the committee reports
 
suggest that the “any person” language is to be construed broadly
 
so as to encompass plaintiffs like Employees who are neither
 consumers, businesses nor competitors. See S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
 
No. 448, in 2001 Senate Journal, at 1116-17 (“The purpose of
 [S.B. 1320] is to allow a private citizen to bring an action
 based on unfair methods of competition.”) (emphasis added); S.
 Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 931, in 2001 Senate Journal, at 1295 (“The
 purpose of [S.B. 1320] is to amend the antitrust and unfair
 competition law to allow any person to bring a lawsuit for
 
-14­ 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
enforcement . . .”) (emphasis added); H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 
1118, in 2002 House Journal, at 1665 (“The purpose of this bill
 is to permit private actions for unfair methods of competition.”)
 (emphasis added). This interpretation is also consistent with
 the Senate floor discussion of S.B. No. 1320.
15
 
Four Seasons argues that standing under HRS § 480-2(e) 
is limited to businesses, competitors or consumers, so as not to include Employees, based on this court’s statement in HMA that “[b]y its plain terms, HRS § 480-2(e) authorizes any person, i.e., businesses and individual consumers, to bring an action grounded upon unfair methods of competition[,]” 113 Hawai

similar views about its scope in a subsequent debate: “This bill, if enacted,

frivolous.” 2002 Senate Journal, at 724 (statement of Sen. Hogue) (emphasis

definition of who may bring suit.16 Similarly, when viewed in 
context, the foregoing passage in HMA appears to have been 
intended to explain that persons or entities in addition to competitors may bring an action under HRS § 480-2(e) as long as they meet the additional standing requirements discussed below, in part II.C. See HMA, 113 Hawai
'i at 110, 148 P.3d at 1212 (“To 
require that the plaintiffs in this case be competitors of HMSA would contravene the plain language of subsection (e) and the intent of the legislature in amending the subject statute.”). Additionally, a broad interpretation of “any person” is consistent with the principle that, as a remedial statute, chapter 480 must be construed liberally. Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Hawai
'i 54, 68, 905 P.2d 29, 43 (1995) (HRS 
chapter 480 is a remedial statute, which is ‘to be construed liberally in order to accomplish the purpose for which [it was] 
16 The committee report states that:
 
Your Committees find that only the Attorney General
may bring an action to enforce the antitrust, or
unfair methods of competition law. This restriction
was the result of a 1999 Supreme Court interpretation
of section 480-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes. However,
the Attorney General does not have the resources to
investigate and litigate all price-fixing claims. This
bill amends the law to clearly give businesses and
consumers the right to enforce the law if the Attorney
General declines to commence an action based on the
 claim.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1118, in 2002 House Journal, at 1665.
 
Thus, the report was focusing on the question of whether persons
other than the Attorney General should be able to bring suit, rather than
providing an exclusive list of which persons would be able to bring suit if
the statute was amended.

enacted . . . .’”) (citation omitted). 
Four Seasons also argues that federal judicial
 
interpretations of the phrase “any person” in similar federal
 
antitrust statutes also limit standing to businesses, consumers,
 
or competitors.  For example, Four Seasons relies on Vinci v.
 
Waste Management, Inc., 80 F.3d 1372 (1996), for the proposition
 
that the Ninth Circuit has limited standing to “only certain
 
plaintiffs[.]”  Four Seasons further notes that HRS § 480-3
 
states that “[t]his chapter shall be construed in accordance with
 
judicial interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes,
 . . . .” 
A review of federal case law interpreting the phrase
 
“any person” in section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a),
 which is analogous to HRS § 480-13(a), demonstrates that “any
 person” is not so limited. Instead, the Supreme Court has
 observed that “[t]he statute does not confine its protection to
 consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to
 sellers. . . . The Act is comprehensive in its terms and
 coverage, protecting all who are made victims of the forbidden
 practices by whomever they may be perpetrated.” Blue Shield of
 
Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 472-485 (1982) (citation
 omitted) (plaintiff, who was an individual receiving health care
 coverage under a health plan purchased by her employer from the
 defendant (Blue Shield), had antitrust standing to sue under
 
-17­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
section 4 of the Clayton Act for Blue Shield’s alleged failure to
 
reimburse her for costs of treatment); see also Novell, Inc. v.
 Microsoft Corp., 505 F.3d 302, 311-15 (4th Cir. 2007) (plaintiff
 was a software developer and had antitrust standing to sue a
 defendant manufacturer of computer operating system software even
 though the plaintiff was not a consumer or competitor and did not
 operate in the same market as the defendant); American Ad Mgmt.,
 Inc., v. General Telephone Co. of California, 190 F.3d 1051, 1057
 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that authorized sellers of advertising
 space, who purchased advertising space in the defendant’s Yellow
 Pages telephone directory and then sold the space to customers,
 had antitrust standing even though not consumers or competitors);
 Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 141-42 (3d Cir. 2001)
 (former employees of a subsidiary corporation who challenged a
 no-hire agreement of the parent corporation, alleging that the
 agreement was a conspiracy to restrain competition in the
 relevant labor market, had federal antitrust standing because the
 agreement precluded them from seeking re-employment from at least
 three divisions of the parent corporation within the competitive
 market).
 
The Ninth Circuit’s holding in Vinci is not
 
inconsistent with this analysis. In Vinci, the plaintiff was a
 former employee of a waste removal corporation who brought an
 action against his former employer, alleging that he was
 
-18­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discharged for refusing to cooperate in the employer’s anti-
competitive scheme to drive a joint venturer out of business and
 engage in predatory price-fixing. 80 F.3d at 1373-74. Four
 Seasons relies on a passage from the Ninth Circuit’s opinion
 which stated that “[a] plaintiff who is neither a competitor nor
 a consumer in the relevant market does not suffer ‘antitrust
 injury.’” Id. at 1376 (citation omitted). However, the court’s
 
subsequent discussion indicates that although “antitrust standing
 is generally limited to customers and competitors,” employees can
 be afforded standing in certain circumstances. Id. (emphasis
 
added). 
The court in Vinci focused on the narrow issue of when
 
a terminated employee has antitrust standing to challenge the
 loss of his or her job as an antitrust violation. For example,
 the court recognized that former employees who were “essential
 participants” in an anti-competitive scheme and whose termination
 is a “necessary means” to accomplish the scheme can obtain
 antitrust standing. Id. The court held that the plaintiff in
 
Vinci did not fall within this category of former employees
 because he did not “allege any facts which suggest that he was
 essential to the alleged antitrust scheme or that his termination
 was necessary to accomplish the scheme.” Id. at 1376-77; cf.
 
Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., 740 F.2d 739, 745-46 (9th Cir.
 1984) (former employee who had alleged that he had been
 
-19­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discharged after refusing to engage in the employer’s scheme to
 
fix prices in violation of federal antitrust law had antitrust
 standing because he was “an essential participant in the scheme
 to eliminate competition” in the industry and “his discharge was
 a necessary means to achieve the [employer’s] illegal end”);
 Ashmore v. Northeast Petroleum Div. of Cargill, Inc., 843 F.
 Supp. 759, 765-72 (D. Me. 1994) (former employees had federal
 antitrust standing to sue for alleged price discrimination by
 their employer since they were integral to the employer’s anti-
competitive scheme in that they either had to take an active role
 in implementing the scheme or face discharge).
 
Vinci, therefore, does not stand for the proposition
 
that the Ninth Circuit has limited antitrust standing to only
 businesses, competitors, or consumers, to the exclusion of
 employees or other individuals. 80 F.3d at 1376-77; see also
 American Ad Mgmt., 190 F.3d at 1057 (rejecting the defendant’s
 claim that standing is limited to consumers and competitors, and
 recognizing that “[t]he Supreme Court has never imposed a
 ‘consumer or competitor’ test but has instead held the antitrust
 laws are not so limited”). Instead, Vinci indicates that
 antitrust standing may extend beyond businesses, competitors, or
 consumers and provides a specific framework for analyzing the
 distinct issue of antitrust standing for a terminated employee. 
In sum, based upon the plain language of the statute,
 
-20­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Employees are “individuals” within the meaning of HRS § 480-1 and
 
therefore qualify as “persons” under HRS §§ 480-2(e) and 480­13(a). Additionally, the legislative history of HRS § 480-2(e)
 does not evince a clear intent by the legislature to preclude
 employees from filing an unfair methods of competition claim, but
 rather indicates that the language is intended to be interpreted
 broadly. Finally, the federal case law would not require a
 contrary result. Therefore, Employees have standing to sue under
 HRS §§ 480-2(e) and 480-13(a) if they meet the additional
 requirements discussed below.
 
2.	 The plain language and the legislative history of HRS
§ 481B-14 establish that Employees have standing to
bring a claim under HRS § 480-2(e) for a violation of
HRS § 481B-14
 
Four Seasons argues that Employees lack standing to
 
bring an unfair methods of competition claim for violation of HRS
 
§ 481B-14 because it “is a consumer protection law designed to
 prevent businesses from engaging in unfair and/or anticompetitive
 behavior.” In making this argument, Four Seasons relies on the
 legislative history of HRS § 481B-14. Employees respond that the
 legislative history demonstrates that “one of the problems the
 statute is intended to remedy is that ‘employees may not be
 receiving tips or gratuities’ that customers intend to be
 
distributed to the employees.”  Employees further contend that
 
“nothing in the committee reports demonstrates a legislative
 
intent to deny employees the ability to seek redress for
 
-21­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
violation of § 481B-14.”
 
As a threshold matter, we observe that the plain
 
language of HRS § 481B-14 is inconsistent with Four Seasons’
 
argument that Employees cannot obtain standing to sue for a
 violation of HRS § 481B-14. HRS § 481B-14 provides that any
 hotel or restaurant that applies a service charge “shall
 distribute the service charge directly to its employees” or
 “clearly disclose to the purchaser” that it is withholding some
 of the service charge. HRS § 481B-4 provides that “[a]ny person
 who violates [chapter 481B] shall be deemed to have engaged in an
 unfair method of competition and unfair or deceptive act or
 practice . . . .” Nothing in either provision purports to
 preclude employees from seeking to enforce those provisions
 pursuant to HRS § 480-2(e). Since we have concluded that
 employees are “persons” who may bring an action under HRS § 480­2(e), see section II.B.1, supra, the plain language of these
 provisions is inconsistent with Four Seasons’ position. See
 Cieri, 80 Haw. at 67, 905 P.2d at 42 (“[w]here the language of
 the statute is plain and unambiguous, our only duty is to give
 effect to its plain and obvious meaning”) (citation omitted). In
 any event, as we discuss below, the legislative history of HRS §
 481B-14 does not reflect an intent to preclude enforcement by
 employees. 
In April of 2000, the legislature passed House Bill No.
 
-22­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2123 (H.B. No. 2123, H.D. 2), which was signed into law as Act
 
16, and codified within chapter 481B entitled “Unfair and
 Deceptive Practices” as HRS § 481B-14. Section 1 of Act 16
 states that “[t]he legislature finds that Hawaii’s hotel and
 restaurant employees may not be receiving tips or gratuities
 during the course of their employment from patrons because
 patrons believe their tips or gratuities are being included in
 the service charge and being passed on to the employees.” 2000
 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 16, § 1 at 21-22. It also states that:
 
The purpose of this Act is to require hotels and
restaurants that apply a service charge for food or
beverage services, not distributed to employees as tip
income, to advise customers that the service charge is
being used to pay for costs or expenses other than
wages and tips of employees
.
 
2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 16, § 1 at 22.
 
The legislative history of HRS § 481B-14 includes three
 
forms of the bill (original, House Draft 1 (H.D.1) and House
 
Draft 2 (H.D.2)), three committee reports, and Act 16 as signed
 into law by the Governor. H.B. 2123, H.D.1, H.D.2, 20th Leg.,
 Reg. Sess. (2000); 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 16, § 1 at 21-22. At
 all times, including when signed into law as Act 16, the bill was
 entitled “Relating to Wages and Tips of Employees.”
17 Id.
 
17
 Employees argue that “[t]he title to the Act is pivotal in
dismantling Defendants’ claim that the law was not meant to benefit employees
because the Hawaii Constitution provides at Article III, Section 14 that: ‘No
law shall be passed except by bill. Each law shall embrace but one subject,
which shall be expressed in its title.’” However, although we believe the
title is instructive in that it appears to reflect the legislature’s concern
that employees may not always be receiving the service charges imposed by
their employers, we do not believe it is dispositive of the issue of whether
 
-23­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Initially introduced as HB 2123, the bill would have,
 
inter alia, added a definition for “tips” in HRS § 387-1 that
 
would include any service charges imposed by the employer, and
 amended HRS § 388-6 to prohibit employers from withholding tips
 from employees. See H.B. 2123, 20th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2000). 
According to the report of the House Committee on Labor & Public
 Employment, which was the first committee to consider the bill,
 it was originally intended to “strengthen Hawaii’s wage and hour
 law to protect employees who receive or may receive tips or
 gratuities from having these amounts withheld or credited to
 their employers.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 479-00, in 2000 House
 Journal, at 1155. 
The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees, Local 5,
 
union testified in support of the proposed bill. Id. The
 Department of Labor and Industrial Relations [DLIR] and the ILWU
 Local 142, however, expressed concerns.
18 Based on those
 
the legislature intended to afford Employees standing to sue for HRS § 481B­
14 violations.
 
18 Specifically, the Committee Report notes that:
 
The [DLIR] expressed concerns that the bill, as
drafted, would delete the tip credit in its entirety
thereby disallowing employers from taking any offset
from the employees’ wages. DLIR testified that since
 the current rules concerning tips and gratuities are
in line with federal regulations, changing the
definitions would cause a lot of confusion for both
 employers and employees. 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 479-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1155. The ILWU
 Local 142 also expressed concerns that “changing the definition of tips would
cause much confusion[.]” Id. 
-24­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
concerns, the House Committee on Labor and Public Employment
 
“amended the bill by deleting its contents and inserting a new
 section regarding unfair and deceptive business practices.” Id.
 
Thus, H.D.1 reflects the Committee’s decision to amend Chapter
 481B (Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices) rather than Chapter
 387 (Wage and Hour Law). The new section, which eventually
 became § 481B-14, would “require[] that any hotel or restaurant
 applying a service charge to distribute it to the employees or
 clearly state that the service charge is being used to pay for
 costs or expenses other than wages for employees.” Id. 
H.D.1 was then considered by the House Committee on
 
Finance, which made only “technical, nonsubstantive amendments”
 to the bill, which, as amended, became H.D.2. See H. Stand.
 
Comm. Rep. No. 854-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1298. The
 Committee’s report, dated March 3, 2000, indicated that the
 bill’s purpose “is to prevent unfair and deceptive business
 practices.” Id.
 
The bill was subsequently considered by the Senate
 
Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, which recommended
 adoption of the bill without further amendment. The Committee’s
 April 3, 2000 report indicates that “[t]he purpose of this
 measure is to enhance consumer protection,” and further noted
 that:
 
Your Committee finds that it is generally understood
that service charges applied to the sale of food and
beverages by hotels and restaurants are levied in lieu
 
-25­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of a voluntary gratuity, and are distributed to the
employees providing the service. Therefore, most
consumers do not tip for services over and above the
amounts they pay as a service charge. 
Your Committee further finds that, contrary to the
above understanding, moneys collected as service
charges are not always distributed to the employees as
gratuities and are sometimes used to pay the
employer’s administrative costs. Therefore, the
employee does not receive the money intended as a
gratuity by the customer, and the customer is misled
into believing that the employee has been rewarded for
providing good service.
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3077, in 2000 Senate Journal, at 1286-87
 
(emphasis added). 
The report went on to state that “[t]his measure is
 
intended to prevent consumers from being misled about the
 application of moneys they pay as service charges . . . .” Id. 
In sum, the legislative history of H.B. No. 2123
 
indicates that the legislature was concerned that when a hotel or
 restaurant withholds a service charge without disclosing to
 consumers that it is doing so, both employees and consumers can
 be negatively impacted. The legislature chose to address that
 concern by requiring disclosure and by authorizing enforcement of
 that requirement under HRS chapter 480. There is no clear
 indication in the legislative history that the legislature
 intended to limit enforcement to consumers, businesses, or
 competitors and to preclude enforcement by employees. Therefore,
 the legislative history of HRS § 481B-14 is consistent with the
 conclusion that Employees have standing to sue as “persons” under
 HRS § 480-2(e) for a violation of HRS § 481B-14 if they meet the
 
-26­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
additional requirements discussed below.
 
C.	 Employees have not sufficiently alleged the “nature of the
competition,” which is required to bring a claim for unfair
methods of competition under HRS §§ 480-2(e) and 480-13(a)
 
In order to state a cause of action pursuant to HRS 
§ 480-2(e) and recover money damages, Employees must first 
satisfy the requirements of HRS § 480-13. Flores v. Rawlings 
Co., LLC, 117 Hawai
'i 153, 162, 177 P.3d 341, 350 (2008) (“In 
order for [the defendant’s] failure to register [as a collection agency as required by HRS § 443B-3] to be actionable by private litigants [pursuant to HRS § 480-2], the threshold requirements of HRS § 480-13 must be satisfied.”). HRS § 480-13(a) provides that, with limited exceptions, “any person who is injured in the person’s business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by [chapter 480]: (1) [m]ay sue for damages . . . ; and (2) [m]ay bring proceedings to enjoin the unlawful practices[.]” 
When analyzing whether or not Employees have 
sufficiently alleged an injury to their “business or property,” this court views Employees’ Amended Complaint “in a light most favorable to [Employees] in order to determine whether the allegations contained therein could warrant relief . . . .” In 
re Estate of Rogers, 103 Hawai
'i 275, 280, 81 P.3d 1190, 1195 
(2003); see Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). 
In HMA, this court considered what a plaintiff must
 
-27­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
allege in order to bring an action for unfair methods of 
competition under HRS § 480-2(e). Specifically, this court addressed, inter alia, whether the Hawai
'i Medical Association 
(HMA) sufficiently alleged injury to itself under HRS § 480-13(a) as a result of the Hawai
'i Medical Services Association’s (HMSA) 
alleged unfair methods of competition. HMA, 113 Hawai 'i at 107­
115, 148 P.3d at 1209-1217. HMA alleged that HMSA deprived over 1,600 HMA physicians of reimbursement for services provided by HMA physicians to HMSA plan members. Id. at 83-84, 148 P.3d at 
1185-86. These HMA physicians had become “participating physician[s]” in HMSA’s network by entering into a “Participating Physician Agreement” (called a “PAR agreement”) with HMSA “to provide medically necessary healthcare services to HMSA’s plan members in exchange for HMSA’s payments at specified rates.” Id. 
at 81, 148 P.3d at 1183. 
HMA, on its own behalf and on behalf of participating
 
physicians in HMSA’s network, brought suit against HMSA for
 violation of HRS § 480-2, and tortious interference with
 prospective economic advantage.
19 Id. at 81, 148 P.3d at 1183. 
HMA alleged that HMSA engaged in “an unfair and deceptive scheme
 to avoid making timely and complete payments owed to its
 
19
 Individual physicians also sued HMSA on similar grounds and the
cases were consolidated on appeal. HMA, 113 Hawai' i at 81, 148 P.3d at 1183.
However, because this court’s discussion regarding the requirements to sue
under HRS §§ 480-2 and 480-13 arose in the context of the HMA suit, we focushere solely on the issues pertaining to that suit. 
-28­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
physician members” after the HMA physicians had rendered medical
 
care to HMSA members pursuant to their PAR agreements. Id. at
 84, 148 P.3d at 1186. HMA alleged that this “wrongful conduct
 (1) constituted unfair methods of competition and (2) delayed,
 impeded, denied or reduced reimbursement owed to HMA’s physician
 members. HMA further alleged that HMSA’s wrongful conduct . . .
 resulted in direct and substantial harm to HMA and its members.” 
Id. at 81, 148 P.3d at 1183. 
HMSA filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,

 
arguing that HMA’s claims should be dismissed because HMA, inter
 alia, lacked standing to bring suit on its own behalf. Id. at
 
85, 148 P.3d at 1187. Moreover, in its reply to HMA’s opposition
 to the motion, HMSA argued that HMA’s claim under HRS chapter 480
 failed because HMA had not pled any direct injury to its
 “business or property.” Id. at 86, 148 P.3d at 1188. The
 
circuit court granted HMSA’s motion for judgment on the pleadings
 and HMA appealed. Id. at 87, 148 P.3d at 1189. 
On appeal, this court considered whether HMA
 
sufficiently alleged injury to itself with respect to its post-
June 28, 2002
20 unfair methods of competition claims under HRS §
 
480-2. Id. at 107-15, 148 P.3d at 1209-17. This court
 
20
 HRS § 480-2(e) became effective on June 28, 2002. In HMA, this 
court held that § 2(e) cannot be applied retroactively because “[n]either the
language of the statute itself nor the legislative history of the amendmentgive any expressed indication that the amendment should be appliedretroactively.” HMA, 113 Hawai' i at 107, 148 P.3d at 1209. 
-29­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
acknowledged the three elements essential to recovery under HRS § 
480-13: (1) a violation of HRS chapter 480; (2) which causes an injury to the plaintiff’s business or property; and (3) proof of the amount of damages.
21 Id. at 114, 148 P.3d at 1216 (citing 
Ai, 61 Haw. at 617, 607 P.2d at 1311); see also Roberts Hawai 'i 
School Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transportation Co., Inc., 91 Hawai
'i 224, 254 n.30, 982 P.2d 853, 883 n.30 (1999), superseded 
by statute, 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17, as recognized in HMA, 113 Hawai
'i at 107, 148 P.3d at 1209 (“[W]hile 
proof of a violation of chapter 480 is an essential element of an action under HRS § 480-13, the mere existence of a violation is not sufficient ipso facto to support the action; forbidden acts cannot be relevant unless they cause [some] private damage.”) (citation omitted). 
This court, according to the majority opinion, first
 
determined that HMA need not be a “competitor[]” of or “in
 competition” with HMSA in order to have standing under HRS § 480­13(a).
22 Id. at 110, 148 P.3d at 1212. This court also
 
21 A fourth element--“a showing that the action is in the public
interest or that the defendant is a merchant”--used to be required, but was
eliminated by the 1987 amendment to HRS §§ 480-2 and -13. See HMA, 113 
Hawai'i at 114 n.31, 148 P.3d at 1216 n.31 (citing S. Conf. Comm. Rep. No.
105, in 1987 Senate Journal, at 872). 
22
 The majority opinion further stated that “notwithstanding . . .
our holding that the plaintiffs need not be ‘competitors’ of, or ‘in
competition’ with, HMSA, the question remains whether the nature of the
competition must be sufficiently alleged. Contrary to the dissent, we conclude
that it does . . . .” Id. at 111, 148 P.3d at 1213. Justice Acoba and
 
Justice Nakayama, who concurred in the result, nevertheless characterized the
majority’s holding as requiring that plaintiffs be in competition with
 
-30­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
determined that a plaintiff “may bring claims of unfair methods
 
of competition based on conduct that would also support claims of
 unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” Id. at 111, 148 P.3d at
 1213. In doing so, however, “the nature of the competition [must
 be] sufficiently alleged in the complaint.” Id. at 113, 148 P.3d
 at 1215 (emphasis added). This court recognized that otherwise,
 “the distinction between claims of unfair or deceptive acts or
 practices and claims of unfair methods of competition that are
 based upon such acts or practices would be lost where both claims
 are based on unfair and deceptive acts or practices.” Id. at
 111-12, 148 P.3d at 1213-14 (emphasis in original). This court
 held that HMA sufficiently alleged an unfair methods of
 competition claim based on conduct that would also support a
 claim of unfair or deceptive acts or practices
23 because it
 
defendants and dissented on those grounds. Id. at 119, 148 P.3d at 1221
(Acoba, J. and Nakayama, J., dissenting) (“it is unnecessary to allege, as the
majority indicates, that HMSA and all the plaintiffs are in competition with
each other for the same ‘customers.’”). However, the dissent agreed that
something more than an unfair or deceptive act or practice must be alleged in
order to bring a claim for unfair methods of competition. Id. (“In my view it
is sufficient that ‘unfair methods of competition’ adversely impact the
plaintiffs and allegations in that respect are made, beyond any allegations of
unfair and deceptive acts or practices.”). 
23 This court specifically stated that
 
HMSA facilitates access to the dispensing of medical
services, and the plaintiffs provide medical services
directly. Thus, in our view, HMSA and the plaintiffs
share the same goal or mission, i.e., ensuring that
medical services are accessible to their “customers.” 
Their success in meeting the common goal-and, in turn,
ensuring the profitability of their respective
businesses-is dependent upon their ability to
effectively provide medical services to their
customers, i.e., the patients. However, if HMSA
engages in acts or practices that impede or interfere
 
-31­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
sufficiently alleged the nature of the competition in its
 
complaint.24 Id. at 112-13, 148 P.3d at 1214-15.
 
As to the injury in fact requirement, this court
 
with physicians’ ability to provide effective
healthcare services to their patients and/or create
incentives for patients to look elsewhere for medical
services-that is, to other participating physicians
who may be reluctant to challenge HMSA or to non­participating physicians-such acts or practices can,
if proven, constitute unfair methods of competition,
notwithstanding the fact that the same conduct could
also support a claim of unfair or deceptive acts or
practices. 
HMA, 113 Hawai' i at 112-13, 148 P.3d at 1214-15. 
24 This court held that HMA sufficiently alleged the “nature of the
competition” by, for example, alleging in its complaint that:
 
11. . . . [HMSA's] conduct has adversely impacted, and
continues to adversely impact, members of [HMSA's]
plans by, among other things: (a) imposing financial
hardships on, and in some cases threatening the
continued viability of, the medical practices run by
[the plaintiffs]; (b) threatening the continuity of
care provided to patients by [the plaintiffs], as
required by sound medical judgment; (c) requiring [the
plaintiffs] to expend considerable resources seeking
reimbursement that could otherwise be available to
 provide enhanced healthcare services to [HMSA's] plan
members; (d) making it more costly and difficult for
[the plaintiffs] to maintain and enhance the
availability and quality of care that all patients
receive; and (e) increasing the costs of rendering
healthcare services in Hawaii as a result of the
 additional costs incurred and considerable effort
 expended by HMA members in seeking reimbursement from
HMSA for services rendered. . . .
 
. . .
 
26. HMSA dominates the enrollee market in Hawaii with
 over 65% of Hawaii's population enrolled in one of
HMSA's plans. In this regard, HMSA is the largest
provider of fee-for-service insurance in the State
with more than 90% of the market and is the second
 largest HMO provider in the State. Similarly, HMSA
dominates the physician market, with approximately 90%
of Hawaii's physicians participating in HMSA's
networks.
 27. It is through such market dominance that HMSA is
able to dictate the terms and amount of reimbursement
 HMA physicians will receive.
 
HMA, 113 Hawai' i at 112, 148 P.3d at 1214 (emphasis and brackets in original). 
-32­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
concluded that HMA established that it had been injured in its
 
“business or property” by alleging a “diminishment of financial
 resources” as a result of HMSA’s actions. Id. at 114, 148 P.3d
 
at 1216. This court quoted Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., 61
 Haw. 607, 607 P.2d 1304 (1980), for the proposition that “it is
 unnecessary for plaintiffs to allege commercial or competitive
 injury[;] it is sufficient that plaintiffs allege that injury
 occurred to personal property through a payment of money
 wrongfully induced.”
25 Id. at 114, 148 P.3d at 1216 (quoting Ai,
 
61 Haw. at 614, 607 P.2d at 1310) (internal quotation and
 bracketed text omitted; brackets in original). Therefore, this
 court held that “HMA need only allege that, by reason of an
 antitrust violation, it has been injured in its ‘business or
 property.’” Id. HMA clearly alleged a direct injury to its
 
business where “HMA was required to divert substantial resources
 and time to deal with its members’ problems created by HMSA’s
 conduct - resources that otherwise would go to support its
 principal mission in service of its members.” Id. (internal
 
25 Ai’s suggestion that allegations of “competitive injury” are
unnecessary might seem inconsistent with the requirement in HMA that a
plaintiff allege the “nature of the competition” in order to plead an unfair
methods of competition claim under HRS § 480-2(e). However, when this passage
from Ai is viewed in the context of the facts the case, it is apparent that
this court was explaining that injury to “business or property” means that a
private plaintiff does not need to allege that he or she suffered an injury to
his or her business property or in a business activity, but rather can allege
that he or she suffered an injury to personal property. Ai, 61 Haw. at 614,
607 P.2d at 1310. Moreover, Ai involved alleged unfair or deceptive acts or
practices, not unfair methods of competition, id. at 611, 607 P.2d at 1308,
and therefore this court did not address the requirements to properly plead an
unfair methods of competition claim. 
-33­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
quotation marks omitted). 
As discussed below, although Employees have
 
sufficiently alleged a direct injury in fact to their “business
 
or property,” Employees did not sufficiently allege the “nature
 of the competition” as required by HMA. 
1.	 Employees have alleged an injury in fact to their
“business or property”
 
Employees sufficiently alleged an injury to their
 
“business or property” within the meaning of HRS § 480-13(a). 
HRS § 480-13(a)’s requirement of alleging an injury to business
 or property incorporates the fundamental standing requirement
 that a plaintiff must allege an injury in fact, but narrows it so
 that a plaintiff must specifically allege an injury in fact to
 his or her “business or property.” Employees argue that Four
 Seasons’ alleged violation of § 481B-14 directly injures them in
 both their “business,” which is working as banquet servers, and
 their “property,” in the form of “loss of tip income.”
 
The phrase “injury to business or property” found in 
HRS § 480-13(a) is not defined in that section or elsewhere in the chapter. However, as discussed above, this court has established that the requirement is satisfied, for example, if “plaintiffs allege that injury occurred to personal property through a payment of money wrongfully induced,” HMA, 113 Hawai
'i 
at 114, 148 P.3d at 1216 (quoting Ai, 61 Haw. at 614, 607 P.2d at 1310), or through the diminishment of financial resources as a 
-34­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
result of a defendant’s unfair methods of competition or unfair
 
or deceptive acts or practices, id. Therefore, because Employees
 
have alleged that their tip income has been reduced due to Four
 Seasons’ allegedly unlawful conduct, they have alleged an injury
 to their “business or property.” 
2.	 Employees failed to allege the “nature of the
competition” 
As noted above, Employees allege in their Amended 
Complaint that Four Seasons failed to distribute the entirety of 
its service charge to its employees and to clearly disclose to the purchaser of the services that employees were not receiving the entire service charge as tip income, and further allege that such conduct constitutes a violation of HRS § 481B-14. Pursuant to HRS § 481B-4, such a violation would constitute both an unfair method of competition and an unfair or deceptive act or practice under HRS § 480-2(a). However, Employees cannot pursue a claim for unfair or deceptive acts or practices because such a claim can only be brought by consumers, the attorney general or the director of the office of consumer protection. See HRS § 480­
2(d). Therefore, as was the case in HMA, in order to pursue a claim under § 480-2(e) for the unfair methods of competition of Four Seasons, Employees must allege the “nature of the competition.”
26 HMA, 113 Hawai 'i at 111, 148 P.3d at 1213. 
26
 The dissent suggests that the present case is distinguishable from
HMA because HMA involved an unfair methods of competition claim based on
conduct that would also support an unfair or deceptive acts or practices
 
-35­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Employees allege that they have been directly injured
 
by not receiving a portion of the service charge retained by Four
 
Seasons, or by not receiving the tips hotel patrons might have
 otherwise left if they had known how the service charge was
 allocated. Even when viewed in a light most favorable to
 Employees, the Amended Complaint clearly does not contain any
 allegations concerning the nature of the competition. However,
 Employees are required to allege how Four Seasons’ conduct will
 negatively affect competition in order to recover on an unfair
 methods of competition claim.
27
 
claim, and that the requirement in HMA that the plaintiffs allege the nature
of the competition was “to preserve the distinction” between the two claims.
Dissenting Opinion at 15. The dissent therefore argues that because HRS §
481B-4 deems a violation of chapter 481 to be both an unfair method of
competition and an unfair or deceptive act or practice under HRS § 480-2, the
need for distinction between the two claims as articulated in HMA is not
 present in the instant case. Dissenting Opinion at 16-18.
However, this court in HMA did not indicate that a plaintiff
alleging an unfair method of competition under HRS § 480-2(e) must plead thenature of the competition merely so there is a distinction between claims ofunfair or deceptive acts or practices and claims of unfair methods ofcompetition. While recognizing that such distinction is necessary, this courtfurther indicated that “the existence of the competition is what distinguishesa claim of unfair or deceptive acts or practices from a claim of unfairmethods of competition.” HMA, 113 Hawai' i at 112, 148 P.3d at 1214. In other 
words, this court indicated that the pleading requirement is based on thedifferences in the nature of the underlying causes of action. Therefore,HMA’s holding is equally applicable to the instant case. 
27 Thus, we respectfully disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that
the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleged the nature of the competition.Dissenting Opinion at 36-38. In HMA, after recognizing that the standard ofreview for a motion to dismiss or motion for judgment on the pleadingsrequires this court to accept the allegations in the complaint as true andconstrue the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we heldthat this standard does not relieve plaintiffs from the requirement ofpleading the nature of the competition in the complaint itself. See HMA, 113Hawai'i at 113, 148 P.3d at 1215 (“In sum, we hold that any person may bring a
claim of unfair methods of competition based upon conduct that could alsosupport a claim of unfair or deceptive acts or practices as long as the natureof the competition is sufficiently alleged in the complaint”) (emphasisadded). In HMA, we concluded that HMA sufficiently alleged the nature of thecompetition because the complaint itself contained specific references to the 
-36­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Amicus Curiae Rossetto suggests that this court’s
 
opinion in Island Tobacco Co., Ltd., v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
 
Co., 63 Haw. 289, 627 P.2d 260 (1981), “recognized that there
 need be no ‘injury to competition’ in order for [an unfair method
 of competition] claim to lie under HRS § 480-2.” For support,
 Amicus Curiae Rossetto cites to the following passage from that
 case: 
[W]e view § 480-2 as being designed to aid
“competitors,” as much as to protect “competition.”
And unlike the Federal Trade Commission Act, the
policy of the Hawaii law, as expressed in HRS § 480­13, is to foster private suits grounded on unfair or
deceptive trade practices, even where the unlawful
acts to [sic] not culminate in injury to
“competition.”
 
Island Tobacco, 63 Haw. at 301, 627 P.2d at 269 (emphasis added).
 
This passage, however, does not support Amicus Curiae
 
Rossetto’s argument. Rather, this language was limited to claims
 
of unfair or deceptive trade practices, rather than unfair
 methods of competition, and was used to explain that an act can
 constitute an unfair or deceptive practice if it injures a
 competitor, even if it does not injure competition itself. Id.
 
This analysis does not extend to claims involving unfair methods
 of competition.
 
Employees argue that “since § 481B-4 ‘deems’ a
 
violation of [§ 481B-14] to be an ‘unfair method of competition’
 
anti-competitive effect HMSA’s alleged actions would have on the marketplace
for healthcare services in Hawai' i and that HMA’s injury directly resulted
from these unfair methods of competition. See supra, section II-C and notes 23and 24. 
-37­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under § 480-2, this Court should not require further proof that
 
such a violation is in fact an [unfair method of competition].”
 Citing to this court’s previous holding in Ai, Amicus Curiae
 Rossetto similarly contends that the legislature, “by ‘deeming’ a
 violation of Section 481B-14, through the operation of Section
 481B-4, to be a per se [unfair method of competition] has found
 the necessary element of ‘competition’ by its legislative
 action.” For the following reasons, these arguments confuse the
 requirements necessary to bring an unfair methods of competition
 claim under HRS § 480-2(e).
 
The requirement that the plaintiff allege the “nature 
of the competition” in an unfair methods of competition claim is distinct from the requirement that a defendant’s conduct constitute an unfair method of competition. The latter requirement stems from HRS § 480-2(a), which provides that unfair methods of competition are declared to be unlawful. See Robert’s 
Hawai
'i, 91 Hawai 'i at 255, 982 P.2d at 884 (“Generally speaking, 
competitive conduct is unfair when it offends established public policy and when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.”) (internal quotations omitted; citation omitted); Cieri, 80 Hawai
'i at 61, 
905 P.2d at 36 (“It is impossible to frame definitions which embrace all unfair practices. . . . Whether competition is unfair or not generally depends upon the surrounding 
-38­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circumstances of the particular case.”) (citation omitted).
 
In contrast, the requirement that a plaintiff allege
 
that he or she was harmed as a result of actions of the defendant
 
that negatively affect competition is derived from HRS § 480­13(a)’s language that “any person who is injured in the person’s
 business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared
 unlawful by this chapter . . . [m]ay sue for damages . . . ;”
 (emphasis added). 
In Robert’s Hawai
'i, this court discussed the elements 
that must be established to bring a claim under HRS § 480-13(a).
 91 Hawai
'i at 254 n.31, 982 P.2d at 883 n.31. We held that “the 
elements of (1) resulting injury to business or property and (2)
 damages” are “two distinct elements” of HRS § 480-13(a), and went
 on to note that:
 
Indeed, federal case law has interpreted the “injury
to business or property” language of section 4 of the
Clayton Act as a causation requirement, requiring a
showing of “antitrust injury.” “Plaintiffs must prove
. . . [an] injury of the type the antitrust laws were
intended to prevent[, one] . . . that flows from that
which makes defendants’ acts unlawful. The injury
should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of
the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible
by the violation. It should, in short, be the ‘type of
loss’ that the claimed violations . . . would be
 likely to cause.” 
Also known as the “fact of damage” requirement, the
antitrust plaintiff need not prove with particularity
the full scope of profits that might have been earned.
Instead, it requires a showing, with some
particularity, of actual damage caused by
anticompetitive conduct that the antitrust laws were
intended to prevent.

original); see also HMA, 113 Hawai 'i at 114 n.30, 148 P.3d at 
-39­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1216 n.30 (citing Robert’s Hawai 'i, 91 Hawai 'i at 254 n.31, 982 
P.2d at 883 n.31). 
HRS § 481B-4 declares that “[a]ny person who violates
 
this chapter shall be deemed to have engaged in an unfair method
 
of competition and unfair or deceptive act or practice in the
 conduct of any trade or commerce within the meaning of section
 480-2.” Amicus Curiae Rossetto contends that Employees do not
 need to allege the “nature of the competition” because Employees’
 claim is based upon a statutory violation deemed by HRS § 481B-4
 to be “per se” an unfair method of competition, rather than a
 claim based on an unfair or deceptive act or practice that is
 also being alleged to be an unfair method of competition, as was
 the case in HMA. However, although the deeming language of HRS §
 481B-4 eliminates the requirement that a plaintiff prove that a
 defendant’s conduct that violates chapter 481B (including HRS §
 481B-14) constitutes an unfair method of competition, it does not
 purport to modify the causation requirement of HRS § 480-13. 
Moreover, even if this court were to determine that the
 
language of HRS § 481B-4 is ambiguous, the legislative history of
 HRS § 481B-4 does not reflect an intent to eliminate the
 causation requirement of HRS § 480-13(a). The current deeming
 language of HRS § 481B-4 (“deemed to have engaged in an unfair
 method of competition and unfair or deceptive act or practice in
 the conduct of any trade or commerce within the meaning of
 
-40­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
section 480-2") was added in 1996 pursuant to Act 59. 1996 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 59, § 4 at 83. Prior to the enactment of Act 59,
 HRS chapter 481B contained a variety of different enforcement
 provisions which were replaced by HRS § 481B-4. See, e.g., id.
 
(replacing the provision in HRS § 481B-4 which provided that
 violators could be “fined not more than $500 for each violation
 or imprisoned not more than one year or both” with the present
 deeming language).
 
The Senate Judiciary Committee report indicates that:
 
The purpose of the bill is to provide a
consistent penalty for certain specific unfair and
deceptive acts or practices of regulated industries
under chapter 480, . . . governing monopolies and
restraint of trade. 
Your Committee finds that this bill is intended
 
to delete duplicative or unnecessary penalty
provisions and by deeming the violations to constitute
unfair and deceptive business practices under section
480-2[.]
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2103, in 1996 Senate Journal, at 1016­
17. 
The report of the House Consumer Protection & Commerce
 
and Judiciary committees similarly provides that “[t]he purpose
 of this bill is to provide consistency in the consumer protection
 statutes by amending certain provisions so that they uniformly
 relate to the unfair or deceptive acts or practices statute” and
 that the “bill is designed to remove duplicative or unnecessary
 recitation of penalty provisions in favor of a simple reference
 to the unfair or deceptive acts or practices statute.” H. Stand.
 Comm. Rep. No. 1459-96, in 1996 House Journal, at 1610.
 
-41­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
While the committee reports reflect a desire for
 
consistency in enforcement, they do not indicate that the
 
legislature intended to modify the causation requirements which
 are generally applicable to unfair methods of competition claims
 under HRS § 480-13(a).
 
The dissent argues that because the legislative history
 
indicates that HRS § 481B-14 was intended to prevent harm to
 employees, it can therefore be inferred that the legislature did
 not intend to require that a plaintiff plead the nature of the
 competition in order to bring an unfair methods of competition
 claim under HRS § 480-2(e). Dissenting Opinion at 30-32. 
However, as we discuss above in section II-B-2, the legislative
 history of HRS § 481B-14 indicates that both employees and
 consumers may be negatively impacted when a hotel or restaurant
 withholds a service charge without disclosing to consumers that
 it is doing so. Moreover, the legislature chose to place HRS §
 481B-14 within Hawaii’s consumer protection statutes and provided
 that it be enforced through HRS § 480-13. Therefore, while the
 legislative history of HRS § 481B-14 recognizes that employees
 are negatively impacted when a hotel or restaurant does not
 properly distribute the service charge, neither this recognition
 nor anything else in the legislative history of HRS §§§ 481B-14,
 481B-4, or 480-2(e) indicate that the legislature intended to
 eliminate the causation requirements of HRS § 480-13 for unfair
 
-42­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
methods of competition claims brought under HRS § 480-2(e). 
This analysis is consistent with Ai, which involved
 
debt collection practices alleged to be unfair or deceptive acts
 
or practices in violation of Chapter 443 and a “deeming”
 provision similar to HRS § 480B-4. 61 Haw. at 608-10, 607 P.2d at
 1307-08. That provision provided that: “[a] violation of this
 part by a collection agency shall constitute unfair methods of
 competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the
 conduct of any trade or commerce for the purpose of section 480­2.” Ai, 61 Haw. at 610 n.5, 607 P.2d at 1308 n.5 (citing HRS §
 
443-47). This court discussed the relationship between that
 provision and HRS § 480-2, recognizing that: 
the legislature . . . did not leave to the judiciary
the unfettered discretion to independently determine
in every case brought under [§] 480-2 whether a
defendant’s conduct had been “unfair or deceptive”
within the comprehension of the statute. The
 legislature instead found it desirable to predetermine
that violations of HRS Chapter 443 would constitute
per se “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” for the
purposes of § 480-2.
 
Id. at 616, 607 P.2d at 1311 (emphasis added).
 
Applying Ai’s reasoning here, by “deeming” a violation
 
of § 481B-14 to be an unfair method of competition, the
 
legislature “predetermine[d]” that violations of HRS Chapter 481B
 would constitute per se unfair methods of competition for the
 purposes of § 480-2, and therefore a plaintiff with standing need
 not prove that conduct which violates HRS § 481B constitutes an
 unfair method of competition. See id. However, by so doing, the
 
-43­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
legislature did not determine that an injury suffered by “any
 
person” as a result of a violation of chapter 481B necessarily
 stems from the negative effect on competition caused by the
 violation. In other words, the legislature was not making a
 determination that any person injured as a result of a violation
 of Chapter 481B automatically has standing to sue pursuant to HRS
 § 480-2 and 480-13. Instead, a private person must separately
 allege the nature of the competition in accordance with this
 court’s holding in HMA.
 
At the time Ai was decided, HRS § 480-13 required the 
plaintiff to show that the suit would be in the public interest or that the defendant is a merchant. This requirement was eliminated by the 1987 amendment to HRS §§ 480-2 and -13. See 
HMA, 113 Hawai
'i at 114 n.31, 148 P.3d at 1216 n.31 (citing S. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 105, in 1987 Senate Journal, at 872). In Ai, this court held that “[s]ince plaintiffs herein have supplied allegations adequate to show that such a per se violation of [§] 480-2 has occurred, we accordingly find that the public interest has been sufficiently made out to confer standing to plaintiffs 
under § 480-13.” Id. at 617, 607 P.2d at 1311. The dissent 
argues that this public interest requirement “is directly 
analogous to the . . . requirement that [Employees] plead the ‘nature of [the] competition’ inasmuch as both are aimed at addressing the anti-competitive effects of such conduct[,]” and 
-44­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
therefore this court’s holding in Ai indicates that in cases of 
per se violations of HRS § 480-2, a plaintiff need not allege the nature of the competition in order to assert an unfair methods of competition claim. Dissenting Opinion at 23. Amicus Curiae Rossetto similarly asserts that Ai indicates that when there is a per se violation of Hawai
'i’s antitrust or consumer protection 
laws, the plaintiff does not need to allege the nature of the competition in order to bring an unfair methods of competition claim under HRS § 480-2(e). 
However, this argument misconstrues Ai. As discussed
 
above, Ai merely emphasized that when the legislature “deems” a
 practice to be a per se unfair method of competition or unfair or
 deceptive act or practice within the meaning of HRS § 480-2, a
 plaintiff with standing to sue does not need to prove that the
 defendant’s action actually constituted either an unfair method
 of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice, and does
 not need to make any additional showing that the suit was in the
 public interest. Id. at 616, 607 P.2d at 1311. Moreover, the
 now-repealed public interest requirement was not “directly
 analogous” to the nature of the competition, as the dissent
 suggests. Although this court in Ai indicated the public
 interest requirement can be satisfied when “the unfair method
 employed threatens the existence of present or potential
 competition[,]” we also indicated that the requirement can be
 
-45­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
satisfied in circumstances where there is no such threat,
 
including when “the unfair method is being employed under
 circumstances which involve flagrant oppression of the weak by
 the strong.” Ai, 61 Haw. at 614-15, 607 P.2d at 1310 (citing FTC
 v. Klesner, 280 U.S. 19, 28 (1929) (explaining that the purpose
 of the public interest requirement is to ensure that a suit
 brought by the FTC under the FTCA is truly in the interest of the
 public as a whole, not merely private individuals); see Ailetcher
 v. Beneficial Finance Co., 2 Haw. App. 301, 306, 632 P.2d 1071, 1076 (1981) (finding the public interest requirement was satisfied in an unfair or deceptive practices case because, even though “the action of the [defendant finance company was not] such as to constitute an unfair method of competition, a restraint of trade or a monopolization of an area of commerce[,]” there was “flagrant oppression of the weak by the strong”), abrogated on other grounds by Hac v. Univ. of Hawaii, 102 Hawai
'i 
92, 105-06, 73 P.3d 46, 59-60 (2003); T.W. Electrical Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Electrical Contractors Assoc., 809 F.2d 626, 636 (9th Cir. 1987) (“Under Hawai
'i law, an unfair act is committed, and 
the public interest requirement is met, whenever the unfair method is being employed under circumstances which involved flagrant oppression of the weak by the strong.”). Therefore, contrary to the dissent’s and Amicus Curiae Rossetto’s assertions, this court’s holding in Ai does not stand for the 
-46­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
proposition that where a statute deems an action to be a per se 
violation of Hawai 'i’s antitrust or consumer protection laws, the 
plaintiff is relieved of alleging the nature of the competition in order to have standing to sue under HRS § 480-2(e). 
Amicus Curiae Rossetto also cites to Flores v. Rawlings 
Co., LLC, 117 Hawai
'i 153, 177 P.3d 341 (2008), for the 
proposition that Employees do not need to allege the nature of competition because HRS § 481B-4 “deems” a violation of HRS § 481B-14 to be an unfair method of competition. However, Flores does not support this argument. 
The plaintiffs in Flores were members of HMSA’s benefit
 
plans and brought an action against a company (Rawlings) that had
 contracted with HMSA to provide subrogation and “claims recovery
 services.” Id. at 155-57, 177 P.3d at 343-45. The plaintiffs
 
alleged that they were injured by Rawlings’ failure to register
 as a debt collection agency as required by HRS § 443B-3(a)
 (1993), which, pursuant to HRS § 443B-20, would constitute an
 unfair or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of HRS §
 480-2.
28 Id. Similar to HRS § 481B-4, HRS § 443B-20 (1993)
 
provides that “[a] violation of this chapter by a collection

 HRS § 443B-3(a) (1993) provides:

agency shall constitute unfair methods of competition and unfair
 
or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
 commerce for the purpose of section 480-2.” Id. at 162, 177 P.3d
 
at 350. Because the plaintiffs alleged that Rawlings’ actions
 constituted unfair or deceptive acts or practices rather than
 unfair methods of competition, HRS § 480-13(b) was applicable,
 requiring plaintiffs to show that they were “consumers” who were
 “injured” within the meaning of § 480-13(b) and HRS § 480-1.
29
 
Id. This court held that the plaintiffs were “consumers” without
 
having to prove that they “purchased” something from the
 defendant. Id. at 162-66, 177 P.3d at 350-54. 
This court recognized that “[b]y deeming violations of
 
HRS chapter 443B an unfair or deceptive act or practice for the
 purposes of HRS § 480-2, it is evident that the legislature
 wished to have chapter 443B be enforceable in the same manner as
 other unfair trade practices under chapter 480[,]” i.e.,
 enforceable by individual consumers under HRS § 480-2(d). Id. at
 
164, 177 P.3d at 352. If private enforcement was limited to
 those who purchased from a collection agency, then as a practical
 matter consumers would not be able to enforce the statute and
 enforcement “would be left entirely in the hands of the state[,]”
 
29
 HRS § 480-1 (1993) defines “consumer” as: “a natural person who,
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, purchases, attempts to
purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money,
property, or services in a personal investment.” Flores, 117 Hawai 'i at 162­
63, 177 P.3d at 350-51. 
-48­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
because consumers do not typically purchase goods or services
 
from collection agencies. Id. This would be “an inconsistent,
 
if not absurd, result that the legislature would not have
 intended.” Id. Therefore, this court held that:
 
Rather, in the context of consumer debt, the
determination of whether the individual seeking suit
is a “consumer” should rest on whether the underlying
transaction which gave rise to the obligation was for
a good or service that is “primarily for personal,
family, or household purposes,” HRS § 480-1. This
 reading is supported by the definition of “debt” in
HRS § 443B-1, as well as the fact that the statutory
structure of HRS chapter 480 does not require that one
be a “consumer” of the defendant’s goods or services,
but merely a “consumer.”
 
Id. at 164, 177 P.3d at 352 (emphasis in original). 
Although this court held that the plaintiffs had
 
established standing as consumers, we further concluded that the
 
plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they were injured as a
 result of Rawlings’ conduct because, although Rawlings had failed
 to register as required by HRS § 443B-3, the underlying debt was
 nevertheless valid. Id. at 169, 177 P.3d at 357. We observed
 
that “Rawlings’s conduct in violation of HRS § 443B-3, while
 injurious to the state’s interest in regulation of collection
 agencies, did not directly harm Plaintiffs.” Id. at 171, 177
 
P.3d at 359.
 
This court’s analysis in Flores addressed alleged
 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the area of consumer
 debt collection and did not extend to cases involving alleged
 unfair methods of competition. Unlike the present case, this
 
-49­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI# I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Amicus Curiae Rossetto additionally cites to Fuller v. Pacific30
Medical Collections, Inc., 78 Hawai# i 213, 891 P.2d 300 (App. 1995), in which
the Intermediate Court of Appeals held that although the Director of the
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs was designated to enforce HRS
chapter 443, a consumer could maintain an action under HRS § 480-2(d) for an
unfair or deceptive act or practice claim because HRS § 443B-20 provided that
violations of chapter 443 constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
Id. at 218, 891 P.2d at 305.  However, because Fuller involved only claims of
unfair or deceptive acts or practices pursuant to HRS § 480-2(d), it does not
address the distinct issue of whether Employees must allege the nature of the
competition in order to maintain an unfair methods of competition claim under
HRS § 480-2(e).
-50-court in Flores was construing HRS § 480-13(b), which provides
the cause of action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices. 
Thus, Flores cannot be construed to mean that unfair methods of
competition claims may be brought under HRS § 480-2(e) and § 480-
13(a) without any reference to the effect on competition simply
because HRS § 481B-4 “deems” a violation of § 481B-14 to be an
unfair method of competition.30  In any event, even though Flores
involved a deeming provision similar to that here, this court
acknowledged that the requirements imposed by HRS § 480-13 were
nonetheless applicable.  See Flores, 117 Hawai #i at 162, 177 P.3d
at 350 (“In order for Rawlings’s failure to register to be
actionable by private litigants, the threshold requirements of
HRS § 480-13 must be satisfied.”).
Therefore, although Employees allege that they have
suffered an injury resulting from Four Seasons’ violation of §
481B-14, which is deemed to be an unfair method of competition by
§ 481B-4, Employees are additionally required to allege the
“nature of the competition.”  HMA, 113 Hawai #i at 113, 148 P.3d  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 1215. Employees have made no such allegation, and therefore
 
have not satisfied the requirements to pursue a claim under HRS §
 480-2(e).
31
 
We note that this result is consistent with the
 
principles of causation that have been developed in the federal
 antitrust context. In both Robert’s Hawai
'i and HMA, this court 
recognized that “federal case law has interpreted the ‘injury to
 business or property’ language of section 4 of the Clayton Act as
 a causation requirement, requiring a showing of ‘antitrust
 injury.’” Robert’s Hawai
'i, 91 Hawai 'i at 254 n.31, 982 P.2d at 
31 Without expressing an opinion regarding its sufficiency, we note
that in their Reply Brief, Employees described how they would characterize the
“nature of the competition” if they were required to allege it:
 
[E]ven if there were some requirement that the unfair
method of competition be asserted, the remedy would
not be dismissal, but at worst, to allow the
plaintiffs to allege such “unfair method”. Indeed, it
is obvious that if one hotel obeys the laws and remits
the entire service charge to the employees serving at
the banquet and another hotel/competitor skims the
service charge and keeps 4-5% for itself without
disclosure, the hotel acting unlawfully can undercut
its stated price for the banquet knowing that it will
be receiving improper gains from the misleading
description of its service charge. This is clearly a
form of unfair competition.
 
Amicus Curiae Rossetto similarly states that: 
In this case, hotels and restaurants that do not
inform customers that they are keeping the imposed
service charge and not paying it to employees gain a
clear competitive advantage because they have deceived
their patrons. They are able to “reduce” the published
cost of their food and beverages in order to entice
patronage away from their honest competitors who
either pay out the service charge to employees or
frankly inform patrons that management is keeping all
or a part of the service charge (thereby telling
patrons that they will still have to tip employees).

883 n.31; HMA, 113 Hawai 'i at 114 n.30, 148 P.3d at 1216 n.30 
(quoting Robert’s Hawai 'i, 91 Hawai 'i at 254 n.31, 982 P.2d at 883 
n.31). In Robert’s Hawai 'i, this court further noted that the 
antitrust injury “should reflect the anticompetitive effect 
either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.” 91 Hawai
'i at 254 n.31, 982 P.2d at 883 n.31 
(quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 489 (1977)). 
When examining HRS § 480-2, this court has recognized 
that “[t]he genesis of Hawai
'i’s consumer protection statute is 
in federal antitrust law,” with a shared “concern for the preservation of unrestrained economic competition and free trade.” Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Haw. 54, 59, 905 P.2d 29, 34 (1995). HRS § 480-2(a), which declares that unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices are unlawful, is “a virtual counterpart of [§] 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act [FTCA].” Island Tobacco, 63 Haw. at 
300, 627 P.2d at 268. HRS § 480-2(b) declares that “[i]n construing this section, the courts and the office of consumer protection shall give due consideration to the rules, regulations, and decisions of the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] and the federal courts interpreting section 5(a)(1) of the [FTCA] . . . .” However, section 480-2 “differs from section 5 of the FTCA in one essential aspect - enforcement. Section 5 of the 
-52­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
FTCA contains no private remedy, rather enforcement of its
 
provisions is vested in the [FTC].” HMA, 113 Hawai 'i at 109, 148 
P.3d at 1211 (quoting Star Markets, Ltd. v. Texaco, Inc., 945 F.
 Supp. 1344, 1346 (D. Haw. 1996) and citing Robert’s Hawai
'i, 91 
Hawai'i at 249, 982 P.2d at 878) (internal parenthetical and 
quotation marks omitted). Therefore, federal interpretations of
 the FTCA, although helpful in determining whether a defendant’s
 actions constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an
 unfair method of competition, are of limited relevance in
 interpreting the standing requirements applicable to the private
 right of action provided by HRS § 480-2(e).
32
 
HRS § 480-13(a) tracks the language of section 4 of the
 
Clayton Act, which provides in relevant part: 
Any person who shall be injured in his business or
property by reason of anything forbidden in the
antitrust laws may sue therefor...., and shall recover
threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost
of suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. 
15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (emphasis added). 
Additionally, HRS § 480-3 provides that “[chapter 480]
 
shall be construed in accordance with judicial interpretations of
 
32
 When interpreting HRS § 480-2(e), Amicus Curiae Rossetto urges
this court to only consider federal interpretations of section 5(a)(1) of the
FTCA pursuant to HRS § 480-2(b), and not interpretations of section 4 of the
Clayton Act. Specifically, Amicus Curie Rossetto argues that section 5(a)(1)
of the FTCA has been interpreted in FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S.
233 (1972), to empower the FTC to define unfair practices to include practices
without anti-competitive effects. However, this argument is misplaced,
because as discussed above, interpretations of section 5(a)(1) of the FTCA are
of limited relevance in analyzing standing requirements for HRS § 480-2(e)
since the FTCA does not have a comparable private right of action. See supra,
 
note 8.

similar federal antitrust statutes.” Pursuant to this
 
instruction, this court has indicated that it is appropriate to
 look to “the guidance of similar federal antitrust statutes as
 permitted in HRS § 480-3.” Robert’s Hawai
'i, 91 Hawai 'i at 251, 
982 P.2d at 880.33
 
The Supreme Court first articulated the concept of
 
“antitrust injury” in Brunswick. 429 U.S. at 489. Several
 bowling centers brought suit, challenging the acquisition of
 several of their competitors by Brunswick Corporation as creating
 
33 Four Seasons argues that because § 480-13(a) is similar to section
4 of the Clayton Act, this court should examine relevant federal judicial

interpretations of that statute pursuant to HRS § 480-3, citing, for example,
to 
Associated General Contractors of California v. California State Council of
 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519 (1983) (hereinafter “AGC”). In AGC, the Supreme
Court discussed the concept of standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act to
sue for violations of federal antitrust law, and noted that standing in the
antitrust context is more limited than the broad “any person” language of the
statute would suggest. Id. at 534-35.
 
The Supreme Court identified a number of factors to assist courts
in determining whether a plaintiff has established federal antitrust standing.
The first factor, which was described by the Court in AGC as the “nature of
the plaintiff’s alleged injury[,]” and which considered whether the injury is
the “type that Congress sought to redress,” AGC, 459 U.S. at 538 (citation
omitted), has since been referred to as “antitrust injury,” meaning an “injury
of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from
that which makes defendants’ acts unlawful[,]” see, e.g., Atlantic Richfield
Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 334 (1990); Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., 248
F.3d 131, 140 (3d Cir. 2001). The other factors identified by the Court in
AGC are: the “directness or indirectness of the asserted injury,” the
“speculative measure of harm,” the “risk of duplicate recoveries” or “danger
of complex apportionment of damages” and “the existence of more direct victims
of the alleged [violation].” AGC, 459 U.S. at 538-545; see also Atlantic
Richfield, 495 U.S. at 334; American Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co., 190 F.3d
1051, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999).
Other than recognizing that federal courts have consistently
applied the concept of antitrust injury when determining if a plaintiff has
federal antitrust standing, this court has not expressly applied the AGC
analysis to unfair methods of competition claims arising under HRS chapter
480. Robert’s Hawai' i, 91 Hawai' i at 254 n.31, 982 P.2d at 883 n.31; HMA, 113 
Hawai'i at 114 n.30, 148 P.3d at 1216 n.30. Since we have decided, based on
our analysis of HRS § 480-13(a) and Hawai' i caselaw, that Employees must
allege the nature of the competition, we do not need to consider theapplicability of the AGC approach in order to answer the certified question.

a monopoly in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15
 
34 
U.S.C. § 18, and seeking treble damages under section 4 of the
Clayton Act for profits they would have received had the acquired
 
centers gone out of business. 429 U.S. at 480-81. The
 plaintiffs “attempted to show that had [the defendant] allowed
 the defaulting centers to close, [the plaintiffs’] profits would
 have increased.” 
Id.
 at 481. The Court noted that plaintiffs
 
were not complaining that Brunswick’s actions had reduced
 competition, but rather preserved it and therefore deprived
 plaintiffs of increased concentration. Id. at 488. Accordingly,
 
the Court found that the plaintiffs’ injury was not of “‘the type
 that the statute was intended to forestall.’” Id. at 487-88
 
(citation omitted). 
The Court examined the underlying purpose of section 7,
 
noting that although “[e]very merger . . . has the potential for
 producing economic readjustments that adversely affect some
 persons . . . Congress has not condemned mergers on that account;
 it has condemned them only when they may produce anticompetitive
 effects.” Id. at 487 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court
 
held that in order to recover treble damages under section 4 of
 the Clayton Act based on section 7 violations, “[p]laintiffs must
 prove antitrust injury, which . . . should reflect the

 Section 7 of the Clayton Act proscribes mergers whose effect “may
be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly.”

-55­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of
 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.” Id. at
 
489. 
Additionally, the Supreme Court has clearly established
 
that even where a plaintiff alleges a per se violation of the
 antitrust laws, the plaintiff must still allege and prove
 antitrust injury by alleging the nature of the competition in
 order to ensure that the injury results from a competition-
reducing aspect of the defendant’s behavior. For example, in
 Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.,
35 495 U.S. 328, 341
 
(1990), the Court “reject[ed] respondent’s suggestion that no
 antitrust injury need be shown where a per se violation is
 involved.” “The antitrust injury requirement ensures that a
 plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a competition-
reducing aspect or effect of the defendant’s behavior. The need
 for this showing is at least as great under the per se
 rule . . . .” Id. at 344 (emphasis in original); see also Glen
 Holly Entm’t, Inc. v. Tektronix, Inc., 343 F.3d 1000, 1008 (9th
 
35 It is important to note that Atlantic Richfield involved a 
judicially recognized per se antitrust violation, whereas the per se violation
of Hawai' i antitrust law in this case is established by HRS § 481B-4.
However, this distinction has no bearing on the underlying analysis for theantitrust injury requirement in the circumstances here, where we haveconcluded that the legislature did not intend to modify the causationrequirements imposed by HRS § 480-13. Thus, it makes no difference whetherthe courts or the legislature have “deemed” certain action to be anti-competitive, because the purpose of the antitrust injury requirement is toensure that the plaintiff’s alleged injury stems from this anti-competitiveaspect, rather than some pro-competitive or neutral effect of the defendant’santitrust violation. 
-56­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Cir. 2003) (“If the injury flows from aspects of the defendant’s
 
conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition, there is
 no antitrust injury, even if the defendant’s conduct is illegal
 per se.”) (citation omitted); Pace Elec., Inc. v. Canon Computer
 Sys., 213 F.3d 118, 123-24 (3d. Cir. 2000) (in order to show
 standing for a per se antitrust violation, the plaintiff need not
 allege that its injury actually “produced an anticompetitive
 result,” but instead must allege that its injury “resulted from
 the anticompetitive aspect of the challenged conduct”). 
The Ninth Circuit reviewed the purpose of requiring
 
plaintiffs to allege loss stemming from an anticompetitive effect
 of the defendant’s actions in Glen Holly. Two manufacturers of
 film editing equipment entered into an agreement to jointly
 market certain products, with the agreement also prohibiting one
 of the manufacturers from selling the products to certain
 customers, such as the plaintiff. Id. at 1005-06. The plaintiff
 
alleged that this joint venture caused the plaintiff to lose its
 customers and was “purposefully anti-competitive” in violation of
 sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law
 because it created a monopoly and destroyed competition in the
 relevant market. Id. at 1006-07. The court recognized that
 
“[t]he central purpose of the antitrust laws, state and federal,
 is to preserve competition. It is competition . . . that these
 statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.” Id. at 1010
 
-57­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(quoting Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979,
 
988 (9th Cir. 2000)) (emphasis added). The court then held that
 the plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the defendants’ agreement
 to “unlawful[ly] remove[] a competitive product from the market”
 was the type of conduct the antitrust laws were designed to
 prevent and that plaintiff’s “allegation of ‘loss stems from a
 competition-reducing aspect or effect of [defendants’]
 behavior,’” thus satisfying the antitrust injury requirement. 
Id. at 1014 (citation omitted; emphasis added).
 
This court has similarly recognized that Hawaii’s 
consumer protection laws are also intended to preserve competition. For instance, in Cieri, which involved claims that the vendors and broker involved in the sale of a residence engaged in unfair or deceptive practices in violation of HRS § 480-2 when they failed to disclose a plumbing problem, this court discussed the underlying purpose of Hawai
'i antitrust and 
consumer protection laws: 
The genesis of Hawai' i’s consumer protection statute
is in federal antitrust law. Although the federal
arsenal of antitrust laws is comprised of severaldifferently worded statutes of varying scope that havegenerated volumes of case law, all of the acts have acommon focus on trade, commerce, and business, and allshare a concern for the preservation of unrestrained
economic competition and free trade.
 
80 Hawai 'i at 59, 905 P.2d at 34 (emphasis added). 
“Embodied in Hawai 'i’s virtually word-for-word adoption 
of the prohibitions contained in the Sherman, Clayton, and FTC 
-58­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
acts is the federal antitrust laws’ focus on commerce, the
 
economy, and competition.” Id. at 60, 905 P.2d at 35. This
 
court also recognized that HRS § 480-13 similarly reflects this
 focus on preserving competition. Id. at 61, 905 P.2d at 36.
 
Thus, Hawaii’s requirement that a plaintiff allege the 
“nature of the competition” in his or her complaint in order to maintain an action for unfair methods of competition pursuant to HRS § 480-2(e), HMA, 113 Hawai
'i at 113, 148 P.3d at 1215, is 
consistent with the federal requirement that a plaintiff allege that his or her injury “reflect[s] the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of the anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation,” in order to have standing pursuant to section 4 of the Clayton Act. Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489. 
Furthermore, this requirement reflects the underlying purpose of both the federal and Hawai
'i antitrust laws, which is to preserve 
unrestrained competition. 
III. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, this court answers the
 
certified question as follows: 
Employees are “any persons” within the meaning of HRS
 
§§ 480-1 and 480-2(e) and are within the category of plaintiffs
 who have standing to bring a claim under HRS § 480-2(e) for a
 violation of HRS § 481B-14. 
However, based on the allegations contained in
 
-59­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Employees’ Amended Complaint, Employees have not sufficiently
 
alleged the “nature of the competition” to bring a claim for
 damages against Four Seasons under HRS §§ 480-2(e) and 480-13(a)
 for a violation of HRS § 481B-14.
