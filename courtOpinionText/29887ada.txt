RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, AND DUFFY, JJ.,
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE PERKINS, ASSIGNED DUE TO A VACANCY
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
This case is the post-remand sequel to County of 
Hawai'i v. C&J Coupe Family Ltd. P’ship, 119 Hawai' i 352, 198 P.3d 
615 (2008) [hereinafter, Coupe I]. In that case, this court 
reviewed two condemnation actions (Condemnation 1 and Condemnation 2) brought by Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee County of Hawai' i (the County) to condemn property 
belonging to Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellant C&J Coupe Family Limited Partnership in Civ. No. 00-1-0181K and Defendant/Counterclaimant/Cross Claimant-Appellant in Civ. No. 
-2­        
  
   
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
05-1-015K (Coupe). In the instant appeal, we hold that
 
(1) the County’s asserted public purpose for Condemnation 2 was
 not a pretext for a primarily private benefit, (2) Coupe’s
 challenge to the value of just compensation set for the property
 in Condemnation 2 could not be considered on remand, (3) the
 
1
circuit court of the third circuit (the court)  erred in denying
Coupe’s request for attorneys’ fees associated with the
 preparation of billing records and/or preparation of Coupe’s fee
 petitions for the failed Condemnation 1, and (4) the court did
 not abuse its discretion in denying Coupe’s request for
 prejudgment interest on attorneys’ fees and other expenses
 incurred in Condemnation 1. 
Therefore, we affirm the court’s
 
conclusion that Condemnation 2 was not pretextual, its valuation
 of just compensation set for the property in Condemnation 2, and
 its denial of Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest. We
 remand to the court to decide Coupe’s request for attorneys’ fees
 associated with the preparation of billing records and/or
 preparation of Coupe’s fee petitions in Condemnation 1.

Defendant-Appellee 1250 Oceanside Partners in Civ. No. 00-1-0181K
 
and Defendant/Cross Claim Defendant-Appellee in Civ. No. 05-1­015K (Oceanside) is the developer of the Hokuli' a subdivision 
(Hokuli'a) which extends from the ocean almost to the Mâ malahoa 
Highway and crosses the border between North and South Kona. Id.
 
at 357, 198 P.3d at 620. In exchange for a change in zoning for
 Hokuli'a, Oceanside agreed to construct a bypass highway (Bypass) 
between Keauhou and Captain Cook to “alleviate unacceptable and
 unsafe traffic conditions.” Id. (brackets omitted). A
 
Development Agreement dated April 20, 1998 between the County and
 Oceanside provided that the County would use its power of eminent
 domain to acquire any property along the Bypass route that was

Coupe’s request for transfer from the Intermediate Court of Appeals (the ICA),
pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.2 (2009) and 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 602-58 (Supp. 2009). HRS § 602-58 states in 
part as follows: 
(a) The supreme court, in the manner and within the
time provided by the rules of court, shall grant an
application to transfer any case within the jurisdiction of
the intermediate appellate court to the supreme court upon
the grounds that the case involves:
(1)	 A question of imperative or fundamental public
importance;
 
. . . .
 (b) The supreme court, in a manner and within the time
provided by the rules of court, may grant an application to
transfer any case within the jurisdiction of the
intermediate appellate court to the supreme court upon the
grounds that the case involves:
(1)	 A question of first impression or a novel legal
question; or
 
(2)	 Issues upon which there is an inconsistency in
the decisions of the intermediate appellate
court or of the supreme court.

refused for private sale to Oceanside. Id. at 358, 198 P.3d at
 
621. 
In an effort to construct the Bypass, Oceanside
 
purchased all of the private property needed, except for the
 
property owned by Coupe, who refused to sell. Id. at 359, 198
 
P.3d at 622. As agreed upon in the Development Agreement, the
 County Council issued Resolution No. 266-00, which authorized the
 condemnation of Coupe’s property and made reference to the
 Development Agreement. Id. On the basis of Resolution No. 266­
00, the County then filed Condemnation 1, Civ. No. 00-1-0181K, in
 
3
 the court against Coupe to condemn 2.9 acres of Coupe’s
property. The issue of whether Condemnation 1 was for a public
 use was initially resolved in favor of the County by partial
 summary judgment on November 27, 2001. 
Id. However, the court
 
reversed its ruling and set the matter for trial because “there
 was a genuine issue of material fact as to the purpose.” Id.

Nigel Richards, Trustee Under the Joan Elizabeth Coupe
Trust; Charles William Coup; Joan Elizabeth Coupe; Miles
Hugh Wilson; Joan Coupe, Trustee under Revocable Trust of
Joan Coupe Dated March 30, 1989, and unidentified
defendants. All named defendants except Robert Nigel
Richards, Trustee Under the Marilyn Sue Wilson Trust, and
Miles Hugh Wilson answered the complaint[]. On May 23,
2007, the parties stipulated to substitute C&J Coupe Family
Limited Partnership for the foregoing named defendants who
appeared in the [] case[].

                 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
During the pendency of the Condemnation 1 trial, on
 
February 5, 2003, the County passed Resolution No. 31-03,4
 
authorizing the County to initiate a second condemnation of 3.348
 
acres of Coupe’s property for the Bypass. Resolution 31-03 “did
 not reference the Development Agreement” and instead stated that
 “the Bypass would provide ‘a regional benefit for the public
 purpose and use which will benefit the [County].’” Id. On the
 
basis of Resolution No. 31-03, on January 28, 2005, the County
 filed Condemnation 2, Civ. No. 05-1-015K, in the court against
 Coupe.
5 Id. 
In Condemnation 2, Coupe moved to dismiss the
 
condemnation on the ground of abatement, or in the alternative,
 to consolidate the cases. The court denied the motion to
 dismiss, but consolidated Condemnation 1 and Condemnation 2 and
 tried the cases in a non-jury trial. Id. As to Condemnation 1,
 
the court ruled that the condemnation was invalid because the
 County unlawfully delegated its sovereign power of condemnation
 to Oceanside through the Development Agreement. Id. As to
 
Condemnation 2, the court held that (1) the case was not abated
 by Condemnation 1, and (2) Condemnation 2 was supported by a 
4
 Resolution 31-03 “authoriz[ed] the acquisition of [Coupe’s] 
private property by eminent domain . . . for the development and construction
of a bypass highway between the vicinity of Keauhou and Captain Cook, Kona,Hawai'i.” (Capitalization omitted.)

 Again, the parties in Condemnation 2 “stipulated to substitute C&J 
Coupe Family Limited Partnership for the . . . named defendants who appearedin the [] case[].” Coupe I , 119 Hawai 'i at 356 n.1, 198 P.3d at 619 n.1.

public purpose. Id. at 361, 198 P.3d at 624. The court issued
 
its Findings of Fact (FOF), Conclusions of Law (COL), and Order
 
on September 25, 2007, and issued a First Amended Findings of
 Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (First Amended FOFCOL) on
 September 27, 2007. The court entered its First Amended Final
 Judgment against the County with respect to Condemnation 1, in
 favor of the County with respect to Condemnation 2, and
 determined just compensation for the condemned property to be
 $162,204.83. 
On October 11, 2007, Coupe filed a motion for statutory
 
6
damages pursuant to HRS § 101-27 (1993)  [hereinafter,
6 HRS § 101-27 states in its entirety:
 
Whenever any proceedings instituted under this part
are abandoned or discontinued before reaching a final
judgment, or if, for any cause, the property concerned is
not finally taken for public use, a defendant who would have
been entitled to compensation or damages had the property
been finally taken, shall be entitled, in such proceedings,
to recover from the plaintiff all such damage as may have
been sustained by the defendant by reason of the bringing of
the proceedings and the possession by the plaintiff of the
property concerned if the possession has been awarded
including the defendant's costs of court, a reasonable
amount to cover attorney's fees paid by the defendant in
connection therewith, and other reasonable expenses; and the
possession of the property concerned shall be restored to
the defendant entitled thereto . Issues of fact arising in
connection with any claim for such damage shall be tried by
the court without a jury unless a trial by jury is demanded
by either party, pursuant to the rules of court, within ten
days from the date of the entry of an order or judgment
allowing the discontinuance of the proceedings, or
dismissing the proceedings or denying the right of the
plaintiff to take the property concerned for public use. In
the event judgment is entered in favor of the defendant and
against the plaintiff, any moneys which have been paid, and
any additional security which has been furnished, by the
plaintiff to the clerk of the court under sections 101-28
and 101-29, shall be applied or enforced toward the
satisfaction of the judgment. In the case of the State or a
county, if the moneys so paid to the clerk of the court are
insufficient, then the balance of such judgment shall be

October 11, 2007 Motion]. In this motion, Coupe requested from
 
the County, attorneys’ fees and costs, plus tax and prejudgment
 interest for the County’s failure to take Coupe’s property for
 public use in Condemnation 1.
7
 
On November 5, 2007, in its Reply Memorandum in Support
 
of its October 11, 2007 Motion, Coupe included an Errata which
 amended Coupe’s damages to $1,535,375.00 in attorneys’ fees,
 $134,940.17 in costs and expenses, $61,612.03 in general excise
 taxes, and $276,722.41 in prejudgment interest. At the court’s
 request, Coupe filed a supplemental memorandum in support on
 December 6, 2007, the County and Oceanside filed their
 supplemental pleadings on December 14, 2007, and Coupe filed its
 supplemental Reply on December 19, 2007. The court did not rule
 on or enter any order on Coupe’s October 11, 2007 Motion. Thus,
 on January 15, 2008, the October 11, 2007 Motion was deemed
 denied by operation of HRAP Rule 4 (2007).

fund  of  the  State  or  county,  as  the  case  may  be.

7 On October 31, 2007, the County countered, arguing that (1) “HRS
 
§ 101-27 d[id] not apply because . . . the property was finally taken for
public use[,]” and because Coupe was “not the prevailing party on the main
issue of ultimately preventing condemnation of the property[,]” (2) “[Coupe]
filed [its October 11, 2007 Motion] outside of the 10-day period permitted
under HRS § 101-27[,]” and (3) “[a]ssuming arguendo that [Coupe was] entitled
to an award of damages . . . any award [was] limited to reasonable attorneys’
and [sic] costs paid by [Coupe] to establish the defense of improper
delegation of condemnation power claim in the first case[.]”

      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. Coupe I - Coupe’s First Appeal to This Court
 
On July 9, 2008, this court accepted transfer of 
Coupe’s first appeal from the ICA to this court. Coupe I, 119 
Hawai'i at 361, 198 P.3d at 624. This court held that (1) the 
court did not err in concluding that “Condemnation 2 was not 
abated by Condemnation 1,” id. at 372, 198 P.3d at 635, (2) “where there is evidence that the asserted [public] purpose
 is pretextual, courts should consider a landowner’s defense of
 pretext[,]” id. at 357, 198 P.3d at 620, and (3) Coupe was
 entitled to seek statutory damages under HRS § 101-27 “insofar as
 the property in question was not taken in Condemnation 1[,]” id.
 at 366, 198 P.3d at 629. As to the second holding, this court
 determined that “it [was] unclear from the entirety of the
 court’s findings and conclusions regarding Condemnation 2 whether
 the court did in fact consider and reject [Coupe’s] pretext
 argument.” Id. at 382, 198 P.3d at 645. The judgment in
 
Condemnation 2 was vacated, and the case was remanded for “an
 express determination by the court of whether the asserted public
 purpose was pretextual.” Id. at 390, 198 P.3d at 653. 
8(...continued)
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS.
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided, that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
-9­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As to the third holding, this court held that (1) Coupe
 
was “entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees, as well as any
 
expenses that may have been incurred by reason of [the County]
 taking possession of the property[,]” and (2) “[i]t is for the
 court to determine whether the fees claimed by [Coupe] are
 related to Condemnation 1 and are reasonable under relevant
 standards.” Id. at 368, 198 P.3d at 631. Thus, this court also
 
“remanded [the case] to the court for a calculation of the
 damages to which [Coupe was] entitled in defending against
 Condemnation 1.” Id.
 
C. 	Coupe II - Coupe’s Request for Statutory Damages
Associated With its First Appeal
 
On January 20, 2009, Coupe filed with this court its 
Request for Statutory Damages incurred by Coupe during its appeal 
in Coupe I [hereinafter Coupe II Request]. County of Hawai' i v. 
C&J Coupe Family Ltd. P’ship, 120 Hawai' i 400, 403, 208 P.3d 713, 
716 (2009) [hereinafter, Coupe II]. On January 30, 2009, the County filed its memorandum in opposition to the Coupe II Request. Id. Oceanside joined the County’s memorandum in 
opposition and also filed a separate memorandum in opposition to the Coupe II request. Id. Pursuant to this court’s order, on 
February 19, 2009, Coupe filed a Response to the County’s and Oceanside’s objections (Coupe II Response), and on March 2, 2009, the County filed its Reply, in which Oceanside joined. Id. 
As to statutory damages, Coupe “asked for $45,383.50 in
 
attorneys’ fees plus $2,098.07 in general excise tax[es] on those
 
-10­        
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fees, $5,775.59 in costs, and prejudgment interest on those fees
 
and costs in the amount of $1,900.35, all of which it claim[ed]
 to have incurred pursuant to its appeal in Condemnation 1[,]” and
 “[i]n addition to those fees and costs, [Coupe] request[ed] that
 it recover for the fees and costs incurred in preparing the
 [Coupe II] Request and the court-ordered [Coupe II] Response.” 
Id. On March 5, 2009, Coupe filed an “Errata to Responses to
 
Objections re: Request for Statutory Damages (Errata) purportedly
 to correct certain errors in the [Coupe II] Request and in the
 [Coupe II] Response.” Id. The Errata revised the amount of the
 
attorneys’ fees requested to $44,696.88, which “include[d the]
 amount incurred in preparing [Coupe’s Coupe II Request.]” Id. 
The Errata also included an additional request for $6,424.50 in
 attorneys’ fees and $259.69 in excise tax on the attorneys’ fees
 for preparation of the [Coupe II] Response itself. Id. at 415,
 
208 P.3d at 728.
 
In Coupe II, this court held that (1) “HRS § 101-27
 
provide[d] a proper basis for fees and costs incurred on appeal
 in Condemnation 1,” id. at 405, 208 P.3d at 718, (2) “this court
 [was] the appropriate venue in which to request fees and cost
 incurred on appeal,” id. at 406, 208 P.3d at 719, (3) the rates
 claimed in the Coupe II Request appeared reasonable, id.,
 (4) Coupe was entitled to $25,676.21 in fees, $1,105.67 in excise

tax,9	  and $1,206.35 in costs,10 id. at 415, 208 P.3d at 728,
 
(5) Coupe was not entitled to certain attorneys’ fees in the
 
amount of $12,220.06 because “it was not clear that [the fees]
 were related in their entirety to [Coupe]’s successful appeal of
 Condemnation 1[,]” id. at 415 n.12, 208 P.3d at 728 n.12, 
(6) Coupe was not entitled to any prejudgment interest, id. at
 411, 208 P.3d at 724, (7) Coupe was not entitled to “costs
 associated with legal research[, ] messenger fees/courier fees[,]
 and [] one-half of the claimed photocopying costs[,]” id. at 415,
 208 P.3d at 728, and (8) Coupe was not entitled to its attorneys’
 fees, excise taxes, and costs associated with preparing the Coupe
 II Request and Coupe II Response, id. 
D.	 Remand Following Coupe I
 
1.	 The Court’s May 14, 2009 Supplemental Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order as to
 Condemnation 2 
On remand, the court, on May 14, 2009, issued a
 
Supplemental Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order to
 
First Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 filed September 27, 2007 as to Condemnation 2 (Supplemental
 FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2). The court’s findings listed
 numerous traffic studies and plans conducted by the County and 
9
 Coupe was awarded excise tax on its $24,570.54 award of attorneys’ 
fees at a rate of 4.5%. Coupe II , 120 Hawai 'i at 415, 208 P.3d at 728. 
10
 Coupe was awarded costs for postage, long distance, fax,
 
transcripts, color copies, filing fees, and parking. Id.
 
-12­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the State of Hawai' i, which recognized “the public need for a 
roadway to bypass the Mâmalahoa Highway and that an arterial
 
highway in the area of the [Bypass] would relieve unacceptable
 traffic congestion of the Mâmalahoa Highway.” Furthermore, the
 court’s findings, in part, stated as follows:
 
19. The  Coupes  contend  that  Condemnation  2,  like
Condemnation  1,  was  driven  by  the  County’s  desire  to  comply
with  its  obligations  under  the  Development  Agreement.   No
 
evidence  supporting  this  contention  was  presented  at  trial,
and  the  [c]ourt  finds  passage  of  Resolution  No.  31-03
(Condemnation  2)  evidences  the  County’s  desire  to  get  the
Bypass  built  for  public  purposes.
20. The  Coupes  contend  that  construction  of  the  Bypass
Highway  was  necessary  to  provide  access  to  Hokuli 'a.  
Oceanside  already  had  public  access  to  Mâmalahoa  Highway 
through  Haleki 'i  Street.   The  Bypass  Highway,  which  bisects 
Hokuli 'a  and  connects  with  other  public  roads  at  both  ends
beyond  the  Hokuli 'a  property,  does  provide  improved  access 
to  Hokuli 'a  for  development  of  a  luxury  subdivision,  but
that  does  not  negate  the  County  Council’s  predominant
purpose  by  enacting  Resolution  No.  31-03  to  obtain  the
Bypass  Highway  for  broader  public  purposes,  consisting  of  an
additional  traffic  corridor  for  those  traveling  through  the
region  (as  opposed  to  those  traveling  to  and  from  Hokuli 'a). 
21. A  highway  to  bypass  the  Mâmalahoa  Highway  is  a  piece
of  regional  infrastructure  for  the  benefit  of  those  residing
in  the  Kona  area  and  has  thus  been  determined  to  serve  the
 
public  interest.
22. Notwithstanding  the  [c]ourt  finding  that  Condemnation
1  was  invalid  because  the  County  delegated  its  condemnation
power  to  Oceanside,  the  County’s  predominant  purpose  in
entering  into  the  Development  Agreement  with  Oceanside  as
referred  in  Condemnation  1  is  the  construction  of  the  Bypass
for  public  use.
 
(Emphases added.) The court concluded in part that the Bypass
 “was not of a predominantly private character[,]” the County’s
 “public purpose [was] not ‘irrational’ with ‘only incidental or
 pretextual’ public purpose benefits[,]” the “adoption of
 Resolution No. 31-03 was rationally related to the need for the
 Bypass[,]” and therefore the resolution “was not pretextual”: 
13.  The  [court]  concludes  that  the  use  (Bypass)  was  not  of
a  predominately  private  character.   The  Bypass  is  a  much 
needed  road  for  the  public  benefit.   A  number  of  studies  and 
plans  prepared  by  the  County  and  State  of  Hawai'i  determined 
-13­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a  public  need  long  before  the  County  and  Oceanside  entered
into  the  Development  Agreement.
   
14. The  [court]  concludes  that  the  government’s  stated
public  purpose  is  not  “irrational”  with  “only  incidental  or
 
pretextual”  public  purpose  benefits.   The  totality  of  the
factual  circumstances  beyond  the  face  of  Resolution  No.  31­
03  does  not  support  [Coupe’s]  claim  of  pretext.
15.  Despite  any  ostensible  private  benefit  to  Oceanside
the  actual  purpose  of  Condemnation  2  was  for  a  valid  public
 
use.
 
16. The  County  Council’s  adoption  of  Resolution  No.  31-03
was  rationally  related  to  the  need  for  the  Bypass  Highway
and  the  County  Council’s  asserted  public  purpose  and
supported  by  the  circumstances  beyond  the  face  of  the
resolution  was  [sic]  not  pretextual.

2.	 Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion for Additional
Statutory Damages Not Previously Claimed in the
October 11, 2007 Motion for Statutory Damages for
Condemnation 1
 
On March 20, 2009, Coupe filed a motion for statutory
 
damages not previously claimed pursuant to HRS § 101-27 for
 
Condemnation 1 [hereinafter March 20, 2009 Motion] with the
 court. This March 20, 2009 Motion requested additional
 attorneys’ fees and costs as HRS § 101-27 damages incurred by
 Coupe from “September 1, 2007 through January 14, 2008” that were
 not previously included in Coupe’s October 11, 2007 Motion, and
 from “February 20, 2009 through March 20, 2009,” that were not
 previously included in Coupe’s Coupe II Request to this court. 
On March 30, 2009, the County filed its objections to Coupe’s
 March 20, 2009 Motion and Oceanside joined. On April 6, 2009,
 Coupe filed a Reply Memorandum in support of its March 20, 2009
 Motion. The Reply Memorandum included an Errata, which amended
 the requested amounts to $117,069.00 in attorneys’ fees, 
-14­        
        
         
         
        
        
       
           
           
        
        
        
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
$5,093.81 in costs, $4,949.76 in general excise tax, and
 
$8,564.49 in prejudgment interest. 
On May 14, 2009, the court issued an order granting
 
Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion in the amounts of $41,685.00 in
 attorneys’ fees, $3,703.33 in costs, and $1,557.48 in general
 excise tax. Of the $117,069.00 in attorneys’ fees requested in
 the March 20, 2009 Motion, the court excluded $75,384.00 in
 attorneys’ fees sought for the preparation of the billing records
 and the preparation of Coupe’s fee petition. Of the $4,949.76 in
 general excise tax requested in the March 20, 2009 Motion, the
 court excluded $3,392.28 in excise taxes that were associated
 with the $75,384.00 in attorneys’ fees. Of the $5,093.81 in
 costs requested in March 20, 2009 Motion, the court excluded
 $1,390.48 in costs that were associated with electronic research,
 messenger/courier services, and travel and hotel costs. The
 court denied all of Coupe’s request for $8,564.49 in prejudgment
 interest. 
In rejecting the $75,384.00 of attorneys’ fees
 
associated with preparing the billing records and Coupe’s fee
 petition, the court ruled as follows:
 
WHEREFORE, there shall be no recovery for fees and
expenses incurred in litigating the propriety of the fees to
be awarded pursuant to Hawai'i Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc. ,
116 Hawai 'i 465, 173 P.3d 1122 (Haw. 2007) (holding
receivers are not entitled to recover fees and expensesassociated with litigation involving the propriety of thefees to be awarded to them because the law imposes on aparty the duty to pay her won [sic] fees and expenses invindicating her personal interests). See also [Coupe II ,
120 Hawai 'i at 414-15, 208 P.3d at 727-28] (denying
[Coupe’s] recovery for the costs it incurred in preparingthe Request for fees and the Response).

WHEREFORE, $75,384.00 sought for the preparation of
billing records for [Coupe’s] fee petition and/or

3.	 The Court’s May 14, 2009 Supplemental
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and
Order on Coupe’s original October 11, 2007
Motion for Statutory Damages, HRS § 101-27,
in Condemnation 1
 
Also on May 14, 2009, with regard to the damages
 
requested in Coupe’s original October 11, 2007 Motion, the court
 
issued a Supplemental Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and
 Order to First Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 Order filed September 27, 2007 Regarding Motion of Defendant C&J
 Coupe Family Limited Partnership For Statutory Damages Pursuant
 to [HRS] § 101-27, filed October 11, 2007 (Supplemental FOFCOL
 for Statutory Damages). Therein, the court awarded Coupe
 $1,535,375.07 in attorneys’ fees, $111,112.28 in costs, and
 $61,612.03 in excise taxes, but denied Coupe’s request for
 $276,762.41 in prejudgment interest and $23,827.89 in costs
 associated with electronic research charges and miscellaneous
 fees including messenger fees, costs to obtain real estate
 documentation and delivery services. 
4.	 Supplemental Final Judgment 
The court filed its Supplemental Final Judgment on
 
May 14, 2009. With respect to Condemnation 2, the Supplemental
 Final Judgment stated that “Condemnation 2 is valid” and ordered
 judgment to be entered in favor of the County and Oceanside and
 
-16­        
 
          
         
         
          
            
        
    
              
           
             
         
         
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
against Coupe because (1) “there was a valid public purpose in
 
Condemnation 2 and no pretext was found[,]” (2) “[t]he
 Development Agreement did not invalidate Condemnation 2[,]”
 (3) “[t]here [wa]s no trespass[,]” and (4) “[t]here [wa]s no
 inverse condemnation.” Just compensation for the property in
 Condemnation 2 was set at $162,204.83 and blight of summons
 
11
  damages at 10% per annum.
With respect to Coupe’s October 11, 2007 Motion for
 
statutory damages for Condemnation 1, the Supplemental Final
 Judgment ordered that judgment be entered against the County in
 the amount of $
1,586,871.52.12
 
11 The term “blight of summons damages” appears to be “unique to 
Hawai'i and apparently stems from this court’s past observation that: 
What is commonly called interest is in fact an additional
award of damages for injury caused to the owner by the
“blight of the summons ” . . . so that the owner may have
 
that “just compensation” granted to him by the fifth
amendment to the Federal Constitution.
 
Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson , 91 Hawai 'i 81, 86 n.2, 979 P.2d 1107,
1112 n.2 (1999) (quoting Territory v. Honolulu Plantation Co. , 34 Haw. 859,
872 (Haw. Terr. 1939)) (emphasis added)). This court has also recognized that 
[o]ther  states  have  referred  to  [this  type  of]  compensation
for  delay  in  payment  in  condemnation  proceedings  by  various
other  terms,  including  “interest,”  see,  e.g.,  State  ex  rel.
Dep’t  of  Transp.  v.  Barsy,  113  Nev.  712,  941  P.2d  971
(1997),  “pre-judgment  and  post-judgment  interest,”  see  e.g.,

“detention  damages,”  see  Walker  v.  Acting  Director,  Dep't  of
Forests  and  Parks,  284  Md.  357,  396  A.2d  262  (1979),  and
“delay  compensation,”  see  Pa.  Cons.  Stat.  Ann.  §  1-611  (West
 
1997).

 The court applied a deduction for a “courtesy discount and/or
 
write-downs of $58,054.41 provided on the invoices plus the court-ordered
discovery sanction amount of $63,173.45.”
 
-17­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
With respect to Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion for
 
additional damages not previously claimed in its October 11, 2007
 
Motion, the Supplemental Final Judgment ordered that judgement be
 entered against the County in the amount of $46,945.81. 
5. Coupe’s Motion to Alter Judgment
 
On May 22, 2009, Coupe filed a Motion to Alter Judgment
 
in Condemnation 2, requesting that the court amend its
 Supplemental Final Judgment to “correct the just compensation and
 blight amounts in [Condemnation 2] . . . based on an apparently
 inadvertent miscalculation in the 2005 valuation of the property
 sought to be taken.” 
On June 19, 2009, the court denied Coupe’s
 
Motion to Alter Judgment because “this issue was not raised on
 appeal and there was no mathematical error by the [c]ourt.” 
II. COUPE’S CURRENT APPEAL (SECOND APPEAL)
 
On June 10, 2009, Coupe filed its notice of appeal on
 
Condemnation 1 to the ICA, appealing the court’s May 14, 2009
 
Supplemental FOFCOL for Statutory Damages, the court’s May 14,
 2009 Order granting Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion for statutory
 damages, and the court’s May 14, 2009 Supplemental Final
 Judgment. On July 1, 2009, Coupe filed its notice of appeal on
 Condemnation 2, appealing the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL as to
 Condemnation 2, the court’s June 19, 2009 order denying Coupe’s

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Motion to Alter Judgment in Civ. No. 05-1-015K, and the court’s
 
May 14, 2009 Supplemental Final Judgment.13
 
This court accepted Coupe’s motion to transfer the
 
Second Appeal from the ICA to this court on December 21, 2009. 
Coupe’s opening brief contains two parts. First, related to the
 court’s judgment on Condemnation 2, Coupe argues that
 (1) “Condemnation 2 was per se pretextual under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and article I, section 20 of the Hawai' i Constitution[,]” (2) “the undisputed 
evidence reveals that County’s stated purpose in Resolution 31-03 was patently and obviously pretextual,” because the actual purposes for Condemnation 2 were “to insulate County from liability to Oceanside [under the Development Agreement] and to 
[Coupe under HRS § 101-27], and to provide an overwhelming
 
private benefit to Oceanside[,]” and (3) “if this court sustains
 
Condemnation 2, the court’s award of just compensation was
 erroneous because it did not take into account the appreciation
 in land values between 2000 and 2005.” Second, related to
 Condemnation 1, Coupe argues that under HRS § 101-27, Coupe was
 entitled to (1) attorneys’ fees and costs for preparing and
 litigating the propriety of fees, which were denied in the
 
13
 Coupe’s Notice of Appeal filed ex officio in this court on
 
June 10, 2009 in Civ. No. 00-1-0181K, and its Notice of Appeal filed ex
officio in this court on June 12, 2009 in Civ. No. 05-1-015K, were both filed
under Appeal No. 29887 on June 16, 2009 and June 17, 2009, respectively. On
 July 1, 2009, Coupe filed another Notice of Appeal ex officio in this court in
Civ. No. 05-1-015K, which was filed under Appeal No. 29887 on July 9, 2009, as
an Amended Notice of Appeal.
 
-19­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s May 14, 2009 Order on Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion, and
 
(2) prejudgment interest to “compensat[e] for the loss of use of
 funds[,]” which the court denied in its May 14, 2009 Supplemental
 FOFCOL for Statutory Damages. 
III. PRETEXT ISSUE AND VALUATION OF CONDEMNATION 2 IN COUPE’S
 
SECOND APPEAL
 
A. Coupe’s Per Se Pretext Argument
 
Coupe’s first argument urges this court to create a per 
se rule that “[c]ondemnations instituted pursuant to a contract 
which delegates the power of eminent domain are invalid as a matter of law, without inquiry into any benefits which may result from the taking[,]” and therefore, any condemnation “instituted before [the contract] was repudiated or invalidated” is also “tainted[.]” Coupe maintains that a per se rule is merited to avoid the appearance of government impropriety and bias and to protect the public against “serial takings . . . [that] would render judicial review futile” inasmuch as “proof of pretext would be impossible . . . as a practical matter, because ‘[t]he government will rarely acknowledge that it is acting for a forbidden reason[.]’” (Quoting Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 379, 198 
P.3d at 642 (quoting Franco v. Nat’l Capital Revitalization Corp., 930 A.2d 160, 169 (D.C. 2007)). 
It appears that the County does not address Coupe’s per 
se argument. However, Oceanside argues that “a per se rule for takings under the public use clause [(a)] has not been adopted by the Hawai' i courts or in any other jurisdiction, [(b)] would 
-20­        
 
         
            
             
           
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
infringe on the legislature’s discretion to make public use
 
determinations[,] and [(c)] would clash with case precedent.”14
 
In its reply brief to Oceanside, Coupe contends, in part, that a
 “bright line rule . . . does not eliminate judicial inquiry, but
 rather focuses it where it will be most productive” and that “any
 inquiry into legislators’ motives would in all likelihood be
 pointless” “because the government understands what it must not
 say to avoid revealing the private influence[.]” 
Article I, section 20 of the Hawai' i Constitution 
states that “[p]rivate property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.” Whether a particular use is a public use “is a judicial question of law to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.” Ajimine, 
39 Haw. at 550. This court has interpreted the “public use” clause to authorize takings for a “public purpose[.]” Haw. Hous. 
Auth. v. Lyman, 68 Haw. 55, 68, 704 P.2d 888, 896 (1985) (“Where the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, a compensated taking is not proscribed by the public use clause.” (Citing United States v. Gettysburg Elec. Ry. Co., 160 U.S. 668, 680 (1896).)). A challenge to “the validity of the asserted public purpose underlying [a] condemnation presents a question of constitutional 
14
 Oceanside contends that “courts will not lightly disturb such a
 
finding [of public use] and will not overrule it unless it is manifestly
wrong,” and, thus, a per se rule would “take[] away any judicial inquiry into
the facts and circumstances of each particular case[.]” (Citing Haw. Hous.
 
Auth. v. Ajimine , 39 Haw. 543, 550 (Haw. Terr. 1952).)
 
-21­        
           
         
        
        
           
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
law, which this court reviews de novo under the right/wrong 
standard.” Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 374, 198 P.3d at 637 (citing 
State v. Cuntapay, 104 Hawai' i 109, 113, 85 P.3d 634, 638 
(2004)). 
As discussed above, in Coupe I, this court instructed
 
that the court may “look behind the government’s stated public
 purpose” where the purported public purpose may be pretextual. 
Id. at 375, 198 P.3d at 638. Coupe I relied on Ajimine, which
 
held that “‘where . . . the [l]egislature declares a particular
 use to be a public use[,] the presumption is in favor of this
 declaration . . . unless such use is clearly and palpably of a
 private character[.]’” Id. at 381, 198 P.3d at 644 (quoting
 
Ajimine, 39 Haw. at 549) (emphasis, ellipsis, and brackets in
 original). Coupe I indicated that “legislative bodies vested
 
with the power of eminent domain have broad discretion in
 determining what uses will benefit the public and what land is
 necessary to facilitate those uses[,]” and quoted Ajimine for the
 general rule which states as follows:
 
[W]hen the public nature of a use for which a taking has
been authorized by law is disputed, the question as it
presents itself to the courts is whether the legislature
might reasonably have considered the use public, not whether
the use is public . This rule rests on the presumption that
a use is public if the legislature has declared it to be
such.
 
Id. at 393, 198 P.3d at 656 (quoting Ajimine, 39 Haw. at 549
 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)) (emphasis in
 original) (boldfaced emphasis omitted). Additionally, Coupe I
 stated that “legislative findings and declarations of public use”
 
-22­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
are accorded “great weight” and are entitled to “prima facie
 
acceptance of [the determination’s] correctness.” Id. at 374-75,
 
198 P.3d at 637-38. Thus, to overcome this prima facie
 acceptance, a defendant must show that such a finding of public
 use “‘is manifestly wrong.’” Id. at 375, 198 P.3d at 638
 
(quoting Ajimine, 39 Haw. at 550). 
A contract that delegates a county’s eminent domain 
powers, raises well founded concerns that a private purpose is afoot. However, a per se rule of pretext would threaten the established rule of deference given to the findings and declarations of the government in these cases. Furthermore, a bright line rule would deprive courts of the judicial function recognized in Coupe I. Relying on this court’s prior decisions and the majority opinion in Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005), Coupe I posited that the decision of the legislature is not “‘conclusive, for the issue of public use is a judicial question and one of law to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.’” Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 
384, 198 P.3d at 647 (quoting Ajimine, 39 Haw. at 550) (emphasis in original). Consequently, this court concluded that a court may “look behind an eminent domain plaintiff’s asserted public purpose” to determine whether a purported public purpose is pretextual. Id. 
Coupe I indicated that whether the Development
 
Agreement was in effect at the time of Condemnation 2 would be a
 
-23­        
        
          
         
       
       
       
        
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
factor in determining pretext. This court explained that “the
 
court’s conclusion that Condemnation 2’s public purpose was
 
valid,” based solely on Resolution 31-03, “may have elevated form
 
over substance[,]” and thus ruled that
 
[d]espite the lack of reference to the Development Agreement
in Resolution No. 31-03, it is not apparent from the record
whether any or all of the same provisions in the
[Development] Agreement that led the court to invalidate
Condemnation 1 were still in effect and underlay
Condemnation 2, or whether other conditions existed such
that the private character predominated. Those issues may
 
be factors relevant to the pretext issue .
 
Id. at 383, 198 P.3d at 646 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).
 
Hence, “whether any or all of the [] provisions in the
 [Development] Agreement . . . were still in effect” at the time
 Condemnation 2 was executed or “whether other conditions
 [surrounding Condemnation 2] existed” that could cause the
 private character to predominate over the public purpose, were
 “factors relevant to[,]” but not per se dispositive of, the
 pretext issue. Accordingly, the adoption of a bright-line per se
 rule would conflict with Coupe I.
 
As observed, Coupe argues that the adoption of a per se
 
pretext rule is necessary because the government “will rarely
 acknowledge that it is acting for a forbidden reason.” But, this
 consideration was identified as an obvious problem in Coupe I. 
See id. at 379, 198 P.3d 642 (stating that “‘[t]he government
 will rarely acknowledge that it is acting for a forbidden reason,
 so a property owner must in some circumstances be allowed to
 allege and to demonstrate that the stated public purpose for the
 condemnation is pretextual’” (quoting Franco, 930 A.2d at 169
 
-24­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(emphasis omitted))). This court addressed that issue by
 
allowing the court to look beyond government findings and
 declarations in deciding whether the stated public purpose was
 pretextual. Id. There may be evidence outside of the
 
government’s declarations and findings that would prove that the
 asserted public use was “‘clearly and palpably of a private
 character’” and that the government’s findings were “‘manifestly
 wrong[,]’” and thus, would enable a defendant to rebut the prima
 facie acceptance of a public purpose. Id. at 375, 198 P.3d at
 
638 (quoting Ajimine, 39 Haw. at 550).
 
However, the burden rests on the defendant, who must
 
show that the public purpose asserted in the findings or
 declarations was “‘mere pretext[,]’” and the “‘actual purpose was
 to bestow a private benefit.’” Id. at 379, 198 P.3d at 642
 
(quoting Kelo, 545 U.S. at 477-78) (emphasis omitted). Indeed,
 this court cautioned that such a showing “‘may be difficult to
 make[,]’” but a defendant was not foreclosed from making such a
 showing. Id. (quoting Franco, 930 A.2d at 169). Given that this
 
court has decided this issue by allowing a defendant to present
 evidence of pretext beyond the government’s findings and
 declarations, the fact that a legislative body may not admit that
 the purpose is for a private benefit does not alleviate the
 defendant’s burden or necessitate a per se rule of pretext.
 
-25­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. Coupe’s Pretext Contentions
 
1. The Parties’ Arguments
 
Coupe’s second argument contends that the court failed
 
to recognize that the actual purposes of Condemnation 2 was
 
first, “to avoid liability for breach of the Development
 
Agreement,” inasmuch as “[a]t the time County was considering and
 
adopting Resolution 31-03, the Development Agreement . . .
 appeared to be in full force and effect[,]” and “[the] County
 believed it had obligated itself to comply with the Development
 Agreement[.]” (Emphasis in original.) Second, Coupe asserts that
 the County instituted Condemnation 2 so that, if Condemnation 1
 failed, the County could “[take] the position that Condemnation 2
 would insulate it from [HRS §] 101-27 damages should Condemnation
 1 ultimately fail.” Third, Coupe contends that “only Oceanside
 benefitted from [Condemnation 2]” because (a) “Oceanside was
 obligated” to build the Bypass as a condition of rezoning
 Hokulia, (b) the “County would have no means to condemn the
 right-of-way from Oceanside” should Oceanside “go bankrupt or the
 Development Agreement be in fact void ab initio,” and (c) “[t]he
 [r]ecord contains no evidence that Resolution 31-03 was part of a
 carefully considered and integrated plan to alleviate traffic
 apart from the Development Agreement.”

liability to Oceanside or to [Coupe.]”15 Oceanside contends that
 
Condemnation 2 was not predominantly for Oceanside’s benefit
 
because “the facts and circumstances surrounding Condemnation 2
 evidences the County’s independent desire to get the Bypass built
 for public purposes.”
16
 
In response to the County’s and Oceanside’s arguments,
 
Coupe initially contends that “[t]he only conclusions which can
 be drawn from the [court’s] finding that the record contains ‘no
 
15 The County contends that Condemnation 2 was not for Oceanside’s
 
private benefit, inasmuch as (a) “[t]here [wa]s overwhelming evidence[,]”
 
including “several government studies that recognized the long-standing public
need for the Bypass based on traffic capacity and safety considerations[,]”
(b) the “alignment of the [Bypass] . . . was preferred and selected by the
County of Hawaii’s Department of Public Works, and [was] consistent with the
General plans that ha[d] been adopted by the County” (internal quotation marks
 and citation omitted), (c) the Hokulia subdivision “already ha[d] two access
 points into the subdivision[,]” (d) other portions of the Development
 Agreement, “such as[] the requirement for Oceanside to secure a performance
bond to complete the Bypass and eventual dedication of the Bypass to the
County, [are] still valid” if Oceanside or its lenders were not viable at the
 time of performance, (e) “the Development Agreement (and the relevant
Ordinances) clearly indicate[d] the need for the regional roadway[,]” (f) the
 court “did not strike down the entire Development Agreement . . . [but]
determined that the condemnation and share fair provisions were invalid[,]”
and (g) “Resolution 31-03 specifically found a public purpose, separate from
the infirmed portions of the Development Agreement.”
 
16 Oceanside contends that (a) after “[t]here were concerns about the 
validity of Condemnation 1[,] . . . the County Council concluded at that timethat a second condemnation was necessary to ‘get this [Bypass] road moving’[,]” and that “they would move forward with the Bypass even if it required that ‘the County condemn and pay for some of the property . . . inthe interest of the general public so that [the public] have an alternativehighway[,]’” (b) Coupe has failed to “provide any evidence showing either thatOceanside would sue the County if Condemnation 1 failed and the County electednot to initiate another condemnation action, or that the County Councilbelieved that [the County] was liable under the Development Agreement toinitiate another condemnation suit if Condemnation 1 failed[,]” (c) it “[was]obligated to build and dedicate the Bypass under Ordinances 96-7 and 96-8 as acondition of rezoning the project[,]” and these ordinances were in effect “before the Development Agreement was executed[,]” (d) Resolution 31-03 was part of an integrated plan, stating that “there was a long-standing need forthe Bypass and there already existed a number of studies and plans prepared bythe County and State of Hawai 'i for a bypass highway long before . . . the 
Development Agreement[,]” and (e) “the public hearings on Resolution 31-03were duly noticed, that Mr. Coupe attended . . . and was given the opportunityto fully present his position . . . , and that the County Council addressedand rejected Mr. Coupe’s arguments of no public purpose.” 
-27­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
evidence’ of pretext is that the [court] either did not look at
 
the undisputed evidence . . . or . . . it simply did not
 understand what this [c]ourt tasked it to do on remand.” 
According to Coupe, the County’s and Oceanside’s “admission that
 Condemnation 2 was filed because Condemnation 1 was failing
 destroys Oceanside’s and the County’s claim that Condemnation 2
 was independent of Condemnation 1” because “an unrevealed side
 benefit [of saving County from breach of the Development
 Agreement] is sufficient to show that the County’s professed
 reason for Condemnation 2 was not the actual reason, since the
 side benefit was never advanced as a reason for Condemnation 2.” 
Additionally, Coupe argues that the court relied on
 
erroneous evidence of public benefit because the review by the
 Department of Public Works was a technical review that does not
 diminish delegation to Oceanside, Oceanside had no access for the
 Hokalia project and could not obtain its rezoning to build
 Hokulia without building the Bypass, and there was no new
 consideration for the Development agreement because “Oceanside
 was already obligated to acquire and build the Bypass before the
 Development Agreement[.]” 
Furthermore, Coupe maintains that “a claim of ‘need’ is
 
not the comprehensive plan envisioned by the majority opinion in
 [Kelo]” and that the general plan “shows two roadways which
 roughly parallel the shoreline” whereas the proposed Bypass
 “results in a deletion of one roadway and alters the route of the
 
-28­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
other, resulting in a single bypass (which strikes diagonally
 
across the two general plan corridors) [and] instead of
 paralleling the shoreline, cuts from nearly sea level to nearly
 2,000 feet.” 
2. Whether the Actual Reason Behind Condemnation 
2 was to Avoid Liability Under theDevelopment Agreement 
As to Coupe’s first assertion that “[a]t the time
 
County was considering and adopting Resolution 31-03, the
 
Development Agreement . . . appeared to be in full force and
 effect[,]” neither the County nor Oceanside argues to the
 contrary. However, the fact that the Development Agreement
 existed at the time that Condemnation 2 was instituted, as
 discussed supra, does not in and of itself require a finding of
 pretext. While Coupe asserts that the County’s true purpose in
 proceeding with Condemnation 2 was to comply with its obligations
 under the Development Agreement, the court’s Supplemental FOF 19
 of its Supplemental FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2 found that “[n]o
 evidence supporting this contention was presented at trial.” 
Coupe challenges this finding, arguing that it “does not reflect
 the undisputed evidence in the record of overwhelmingly private
 benefit, and lack of public benefit from Condemnation 2.” 
However, other than Coupe’s assertion, there is no support in the
 record on remand that complying with the Development Agreement
 predominated over the public purpose of building a traffic
 corridor for the public at large traveling through the Kona area. 
-29­        
        
           
             
          
           
            
        
       
           
          
            
          
      
           
           
          
          
          
           
           
         
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Instead, the record suggests that at least some of the council
 
members believed that the County was not in breach of the
 Development Agreement and that Condemnation 2 was necessary to
 build the Bypass for the general public. 
For example, the minutes of the January 7, 2003 public
 
hearing on Resolution 31-03, reflect that one council member
 stated: 
I’m going to vote against [Resolution 31-03] [], although
the need for the road is enormous, the people in Kona do
need it. What I see is that we’re being having [sic] to pay
multiple times for this road. We’ve carried out our portion
 
of the development agreement. I think that we don’t need to
 
carry out any further parts of this. The ball should be in
 Hokulia or [Oceanside’s] court, and they should be taking
care of these costs. Thank you.
 
(Emphasis added.) Another council member asserted:
 
I’ll be supporting the resolution. We need to get this road
moving; and if it requires that the County condemn and pay
for some of the property in order to get this road done in
the interest of the general public so that we have an
alternative highway, because of the terrible traffic
conditions in Kona; I think that we need to do this ; and
that we need to show our resolve in getting this road built.
 
(Emphasis added.) Further, another council member declared:
 
I, too, will be supporting [Resolution 31-03]. When I ran
 
for election, part of my promise was that I’d do everything
that I could to improve the road situation in Kona; and
believe me, when I was going door to door, that was the
biggest concern of the people. And to not do everything we
can do would be derelict, in my opinion ; and particularly
for me, since this is in the heart of my district.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
As noted before, Coupe argues that “even if saving
 
County from breach of the Development Agreement was only a ‘side’
 
benefit[,]” “an unrevealed side benefit is sufficient to show
 that the County’s professed reason for Condemnation 2 was not the
 actual reason[.]” However, Coupe cites no authority for this
 
-30­        
           
       
     
       
        
      
         
          
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
proposition. “[G]reat weight is accorded to legislative findings 
and declarations of public use” and a heavy burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the use was “clearly and palpably of a private character.” Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 374-75, 198 P.3d 
at 637-38 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Consequently, the argument that a “side benefit[,]” even if “not advanced[,]” should automatically establish that the government’s professed reason for condemnation is not the actual reason, is not persuasive. 
3.	 Whether the Actual Reason Behind Condemnation 2
 
was to Avoid Liability Under HRS § 101-27
 
Next, as stated previously, Coupe argues that
 
Condemnation 2 was instituted so that if Condemnation 1 failed,
 
the County could assert that it was not liable for damages under
 HRS § 101-27 because the land would eventually be taken in
 Condemnation 2. In response to this argument, Oceanside asserts
 that “Coupe[] did not make this argument to the court below[.]” 
Coupe, on the other hand, contends that it raised this issue
 below when Coupe “urged the court to view Condemnation 2 in light
 of Condemnation 1 and the Development Agreement” in its proposed
 COL 21.
17 Coupe’s proposed COL 21 stated: 
21.	 Thus, in the present case, the [c]ourt must look to
the context of Condemnation 2 and the factual
 situation surrounding it, which includes the
historical context of the taking, the specific series
of events leading to Resolution 2 and Condemnation 2,
and the legislative history including statements made
by County officials - not just the text of Resolution
 
17
 On March 20, 2009, Coupe submitted to the court its proposed
 
findings of fact and conclusions of law in Civil No. 05-1-015K.
 
-31­        
         
         
        
         
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2 - to determine whether Condemnation 2 is for a 
public use, or whether it was pretextual as the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court instructed on remand. Church of Lukumi 
Bablu Aye. Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520
(1993); [Coupe I] , 119 Hawai 'i 352, 198 P.3d 615 
(2008). 
Although proposed COL 21 contends in general terms that the court
 
must look at the facts surrounding Condemnation 2, proposed COL
 21 did not make any reference to avoiding liability under HRS
 § 101-27. Thus, Coupe did not raise the County’s avoidance of a
 liability claim under HRS § 101-27 as a reason for Condemnation
 2. Consequently, this court need not address this issue on 
appeal. See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 
947 (2004) (“[I]f a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil cases.”); State v. Hoglud, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990) (“[T]he failure to properly raise an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on appeal.”) (Citation omitted.). 
Even if Coupe did raise this argument below, there is
 
no evidence in the record to reflect that the County’s actual
 purpose for Condemnation 2 was to avoid liability for attorneys’
 fees and costs under HRS § 101-27. It is true that in defending
 against Coupe’s October 11, 2007 Motion, the County asserted,
 inter alia, that it was not liable because the property was
 eventually taken in Condemnation 2. However, there is no
 evidence that this was the prevailing reason for the County
 Council’s approval of Condemnation 2. Thus, while Condemnation 2
 
-32­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
provided an incidental benefit to the County, as Coupe maintains,
 
it is insufficient to rebut the strong presumption in favor of
 the court’s finding of public purpose in Condemnation 2.
 
4. 	Whether the Actual Reason was to “Provide an
 
Overwhelming Benefit to Oceanside”
 
a. 	Coupe’s argument that Oceanside could
not open Hokulia without acquiring,
completing, and conveying the Bypass to
the County
 
Coupe argues, as said before, that the only entity that
 
stood to benefit from Condemnation 2 was Oceanside because
 
Oceanside could not open the Hokulia project without completing
 and conveying the Bypass to the County. To support this
 argument, Coupe asserts that Oceanside had invested in excess of
 $90 million in Hokulia, and Ordinance 94-73 required Oceanside to
 build the Bypass as a condition of its zoning change. 
The Supreme Court has recognized that “the government’s 
pursuit of a public purpose will often benefit individual private parties.” Kelo, 545 U.S. at 485. Where the asserted public 
purpose is a road, this court has noted that “the character of the proposed public use, i.e., a public road, is itself strong evidence mitigating in favor of the presumption of validity” and “[i]ndisputably, public roads have long been recognized as a public purpose for which private property may be condemned.” Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 380 n.32, 198 P.3d at 643 n.32 (citations 
omitted). “But, ‘the single fact that a project is a road does 
not per se make it a public road.’” Id. (quoting City of Novi v. 
-33­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Robert Adell Children’s Funded Trust, 701 N.W.2d 144, 150 (Mich.
 
2005) (emphasis in original)). “[W]hen considering a
 condemnation action for the purpose of constructing a public
 road, there is no mechanical formula for determining public use”;
 instead, “[t]his issue must be decided on a case-by-case basis.” 
Id. (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted).
 
There are many factors that courts have considered when
 
determining whether a road is a public use. Courts have
 recognized that roads often benefit the owners of adjacent or
 nearby property and are often constructed at the request of
 individuals; however, such a benefit to adjoining property owners
 does not render the taking invalid. See e.g., Sturgill v.
 
Commonwealth, Dept. of Highways, 384 S.W.2d 89, 91 (Ky. 1964)
 (“Any public way naturally confers a special benefit on those
 persons whose property adjoins it.”); Rogers Dev. Co. v. Town of
 Tilton, 781 A.2d 1029, 1034 (N.H. 2001) (holding that “although
 [the developer] will be particularly benefitted by the dedication
 of the roads to public use, the taking of the landowners’
 property for that use is constitutional”); cf. Territory by Sylva
 v. Mendonca, 46 Haw. 83, 95, 375 P.2d 6, 13 (1962) (recognizing
 that landowners in a condemnation proceeding may receive special
 and direct benefit “arising from its own position upon the way
 itself” in addition to general benefit.) Where the road is to be
 open for public travel, courts have weighed such a factor in
 favor of a public use even if the road is more convenient only to
 
-34­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a few individuals. See, e.g., Road Dist. No. 4 v. Frailey, 145
 
N.E. 195, 197 (Ill. 1924) (stating that “the great weight of
 
authority in this country sustains the right of the Legislature
 to authorize the taking of private property against the owner's
 consent where the taking is for a public use, notwithstanding a
 much greater benefit will accrue to private parties especially
 interested than to the public generally”); Sturgill, 384 S.W.2d
 at 91 (“The accepted test is whether the roadway is under the
 control of public authorities and is open to public use, without
 regard to private interest or advantage.”); City of Novi, 701
 N.W.2d at 151 (upholding a public use where (a) the city
 “initiated the project in response to the growing traffic
 problems in the area[,]” (b) “[o]wnership, control, and
 maintenance w[ould] remain with that public body[,]” and
 (c) “although [a private entity]” may be the primary user of the
 spur, [i]t is the right of travel by all the world, and not the
 exercise of the right, which constitutes a way a public highway”
 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); State Highway
 Comm’n v. Thorton, 156 S.E.2d 248, 260 (N.C. 1967) (holding that
 “[a] road does not cease to be a public road merely by reason of
 the fact that one individual or corporation derives more benefits
 from it than does anyone else”). 
On the other hand, courts have held that a road which
 
is not a public highway or which is not open to the public is not
 a public use. See Tolksdorf v. Griffiff, 626 N.W.2d 163, 169
 
-35­        
         
         
        
         
       
       
         
          
          
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Mich. 2001) (holding unconstitutional a state law that allowed
 
landlocked private landowners to build private roads on property
 of others, finding that “[a]ny benefit to the public at large was
 purely incidental and far too attenuated to support a
 constitutional taking of private property” (citation omitted));
 Thorton, 156 S.E.2d at 260 (stating that, “if, in reality, [the
 road] is by its very nature and location to be used only by one
 family or corporation, save for occasional incidental use by
 visitors, it is not a public road and the property of another
 person cannot be taken for its construction under the power of
 eminent domain”);. 
i.
 
Contrary to Coupe’s assertions, the record reflects
 
that Oceanside was not the only entity that stood to benefit from
 the construction of the Bypass. As indicated in the court’s
 findings in the Supplemental FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2, the
 record reflects that “a number of studies and plans” were
 undertaken by the County, prior to the development agreement,
 that recognized the public’s need for a Bypass. In particular,
 on remand, the following Supplemental FOFs in Supplemental FOFCOL
 as to Condemnation 2 state in relevant part:
 
3. A 1979 State Department of Transportation study stated
that a highway to bypass the M âmalahoa Highway would be
 
beneficial because the M âmalahoa Highway did not conform to
the desired level of service criteria due to the inadequate
physical elements of the existing highway, high accident
rates, anticipated higher traffic volume and congestion, and
the need for a route continuously around the island .
4. The Department of Planning Kona Regional Plan (1982) stated
 
that “traffic counts [on M âmalahoa Highway] show the traffic to be
equal to or exceeding the roadway design capacity which is an
 
-36­        
          
       
        
        
           
          
          
       
         
 
          
        
   
         
      
        
       
         
        
         
        
          
   
         
       
     
   
        
       
        
  
           
        
        
        
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
undesirable traffic condition . . . [resulting in] heavy burden on
the roadway network, increasing both travel time and
inconvenience. ” A community survey conducted in connection with
the report indicated that the deteriorating traffic condition was
viewed as a major problem by a third of the sample group.
5. The 1989 Hawai 'i County Council General Plan (Ordinance 89-142)
adopted the 1979 State Bypass highway and Ali 'i Highway. The 
General Plan’s South Kona transportation course of actionidentified as desirable the construction of a roadway from Keauhouto Nâpô'ôpo'o. 
6. A November 1995 traffic study stated that the Bypass
Highway “will result in a beneficial reduction of traffic
 volumes on M âmalahoa Highway .”
 
7. A June 1997 traffic study concluded that: “The
 
fundamental public enhancement provided by the proposed
project [Bypass] will be its contribution to helping relieve
the congested regional transportation system.” The traffic
 
study again confirmed that there was a limited ability to
improve the M âmalahoa Highway between the areas of Honalo
and Captain Cook because of the limits to the existing
highway right of way, the existing business and structures
that presently exist on the right away and the number of
other topographical constraints.
8. A 1998 study prepared for the Department of
Transportation recognized the need, based on traffic safety
considerations, for the Bypass Highway .
 
. . . .
 15. Community and public meetings, including those held
before the Planning Commission, the Planning Committee and
the County Council, have shown support for the Bypass
Highway.
16. A highway to bypass the M âmalahoa Highway has thus been
determined to serve the public interest and no credible
evidence was presented that indicate that the County Council
intended that Oceanside, as opposed to the public, would
predominantly benefit from Resolution No. 31-03.
 
(Brackets in original.) Coupe did not challenge any of the above
 
findings on appeal, and therefore, these findings are binding on
 this court. See Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 
170 (2004) (“This court has held that findings of fact . . . that
 are not challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate
 court.”) (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.). 
Hence, these studies and plans support a conclusion that the
 Bypass satisfied a broad public use of alleviating traffic
 congestion in the area, rather than to simply confer a wholly
 private benefit to Oceanside.
 
-37­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Furthermore, the instant case does not present the
 
situation where “[the Bypass] is by its very nature and location
 
to be used only by [Oceanside], save for occasional incidental
 use by visitors[.]” Thorton, 156 S.E.2d at 260. While the
 
condemned property is to be initially transferred to Oceanside,
 the Development Agreement required that Oceanside dedicate the
 Bypass to the County upon its completion and that the County
 would “assume all responsibility and costs for operation,
 maintenance, repair, or reconstruction of the [Bypass].” In the
 instant case, the County would ultimately be given ownership,
 control and maintenance of the Bypass, and Oceanside would have
 no ability to control the use of, or access to, the Bypass. 
Coupe admits that “over 1,250 acres of Oceanside’s 
project did touch a public road” and the existing road system was “at 80% capacity, and traffic improvements along Mâmalahoa Highway would significantly increase traffic flow through the area.” Moreover, the court’s Supplemental FOF 20 in the court’s FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2, stated that “Oceanside already had public access to the Mâmalahoa Highway through Haleki' i Street” 
and “[t]he Bypass . . . , which bisects Hokulia and connects with other public roads at both ends beyond the Hokulia property[.]” (Emphasis added.) Supplemental FOF 20 acknowledged that the Bypass “does provide improved access to Hokulia for development of a luxury subdivision[.]” It stated further, however, that “that does not negate the County Council’s predominant purpose by 
-38­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
enacting Resolution 31-03 to obtain the Bypass Highway for [a]
 
broader public purpose, consisting of an additional traffic
 corridor for those traveling through the region (as opposed to
 those traveling to and from Hokulia).” (Emphasis in original.) 
Coupe challenges the court’s Supplemental FOF 20,
 
arguing that Oceanside’s “requested rezoning could not be
 accommodated by the existing road system,” and, thus,
 “Oceanside’s needs predominated over public needs, because it was
 Oceanside’s need for a rezoning that would add hundreds of
 residential units to the system that required the construction of
 the [B]ypass so Oceanside would have sufficient access without
 burdening the existing traffic net.” Nevertheless, that the
 Bypass allows Oceanside to develop its property does not detract
 or destroy the public character of the Bypass or render the
 condemnation invalid.
 
ii.
 
Next, according to Coupe, the change in the northern 
terminus of the Bypass from Kuakini Highway to Ali' i Highway was 
to benefit Oceanside. The court clearly rejected this argument, stating in FOF 18 of its Supplemental FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2, that “the alignment of the [Bypass], with a northern terminus at Ali'i Highway rather than at Kuakini Highway, was 
[(1)] preferred and selected by the [C]ounty, and [(2)] is consistent with the General Plans that have been adopted by the County.” Coupe challenges FOF 17 and 18, that the Bypass was in 
-39­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conformity with the General Plan, arguing that the finding is
 
“plain error” and “reflects that the [] court made no effort to
 look below the surface of Oceanside’s and [the] County’s
 representations.” 
However, contrary to Coupe’s assertions, there is
 
substantial evidence in the record to support the court’s
 findings. For example, in the testimony of Donna Kiyosaki,
 director and chief engineer of the County of Hawai' i Department of 
Public Works from 1993 to 1998, Kiyosaki explained the County’s
 reasons for moving the northern terminus from the intersection of
 Kuakini and Mâmalahoa highway to the Ali 'i Highway were as 
follows: 
As  we  started  reviewing  available  information  for  this
bypass  road  and  looking  at  options  that  were  available,
alternatives  that  were  available,  we  soon  realized  that
there  were  a  lot  of  issues  with  the  Kuakini  intersection,
including  some  difficult  engineering  design,  that  would  have
to  be  accomplished  in  order  to  make  that  intersection  work
as  well  as  the  need  to  go  through  an  area  that  would  require
the  taking  of  private  properties  in  terms  of  actual  smaller
lots  in  residential  areas  and  would  exact  people  in  the
 
area.
   
At  the  same  time  we  were  pushing  to  get  Ali'i  Highway 
Bypass  Road  designed  and  completed.   When  we  looked  at  all
 
the  concerns  combined,  we  felt  continuation  of  the  Ali'i 
Highway  .  .  .  would  provide  that  type  of  regional  bypass
road  that  would  make  sense  for  the  Kona  area.
 
(Emphases added.) Kiyosaki elaborated on the safety and
 engineering design difficulties with the Kuakini intersection,
 stating that:
 
Kuakini  being  an  existing  road  was  already  seeing  a  host  of
issues  regarding  safety,  because  it  had  a  lot  of  direct
access  from  properties  onto  the  road.   So  it  was  not  what
 
you  would  call  a  limited  access  type  of  road.   There  were  a
 
lot  of  stops  along  the  road,  a  lot  of  direct  driveways  on
the  road.   And  especially  near  that  intersection  point,  the
grade  was  very  steep,  and  it  was  not  a  place  that  it  would
have  been  easy  to  make  a  connection  to.
   
-40­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Any  connection  you  made  to  that  would  cause,  I
believe,  congestion  and  problems  along  Kuakini  in  the
condition  that  it  was  currently  in.   And  making  improvements
to  Kuakini  would  have  been  very  difficult.
 
(Emphases added.) She also testified that a letter from the 
County of Hawaii Department of Public Works was sent to the project manager of Oceanside on January 4, 1995, which related that the alternative location of the Bypass, with the northern terminus at Ali' i Highway, “provide[d] the best overall 
circulation system for this region of Kona in accordance with the General Plan Facilities Map.” 
William Moore was “retained by Oceanside to assist in
 
the completion of the [Bypass Highway]” and “did the initial
 contacts with all the landowners” along the Bypass. He testified
 that (1) his work on the Bypass process resulted from “the
 approval of the alignment by the Department of Public Works in
 [a] January 1995 letter[,]” (2) “[it was] the Department of
 Public Works that ma[de the] determination on the alignment,” and
 (3) “it was [his] understanding that the determination was made
 in that January ‘95 letter[.]” 
In light of Kiyosaki’s testimony, the January 4, 1995 
letter, and Moore’s testimony, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the court’s supplemental FOF 20 in the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2. In re Water 
Use Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000) 
(recognizing that substantial evidence is “credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
-41­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion” (quoting 
Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai' i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 
1225 (1999))). Thus, Supplemental FOF 20 is not clearly erroneous. See id. (A finding of fact “is clearly erroneous when 
(1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding
 or determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to support
 the finding or determination, the appellate court is left with
 the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.”). 
b. 	Coupe’s argument that the County had no assurance
that Oceanside or its lenders would be viable at
 the time of performance
 
Coupe contends that the County receives no benefit from
 
Condemnation 2 because should “Oceanside go bankrupt or the
 
Development Agreement be in fact void ab initio, County would
 have no means to condemn the right-of-way from Oceanside.” Coupe
 asserts that in the hypothetical situation in which Oceanside or
 its lenders declare bankruptcy while the Bypass was being
 constructed, “[t]he Development Agreement being an executive
 contract, could be voided . . . , leaving County with an
 unsecured damage claim” and the bankrupt estate could then sell
 the “partially built right-of-way” to the highest bidder. Coupe
 also argues that if the Development Agreement was illegal, then
 Oceanside would have no obligation to build the Bypass. 
As discussed above, there is a presumption that the
 
declared public purpose in Resolution 31-03 is valid, and Coupe
 bears the heavy burden of proving that the finding of public
 
-42­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
purpose is manifestly wrong. See Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 375, 198 
P.3d at 638. The fact that Coupe can posit a hypothetical 
situation in which the Bypass may not be built, does not establish that Condemnation 2 was clearly and palpably of a private nature and provided no benefit to the public. Whether there are contingencies in the future that might prevent Oceanside from building the Bypass is not dispositive in the inquiry of whether the actual reason for the taking was for a public purpose. Thus, Coupe’s argument that Condemnation 2 was a “sham” because the County had no assurance that Oceanside or its lenders would be viable at the time of performance, is unavailing. 
c. 	Coupe’s argument that there is no evidence
that Resolution 32-03 was part of a carefully
considered and integrated plan to alleviate
traffic
 
As discussed supra, the court’s findings in the 
Supplemental FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2 reflects that “a number 
of studies and plans” were undertaken by the County prior to the Development Agreement. For example, in 1979, the State of Hawai' i 
Department of Transportation (DOT) conducted a preliminary engineering report “to perform the preliminary planning activities necessary to define a highway corridor through North and South Kona . . . , thereby enabling the State to design a safe and efficient highway through that area.” According to the 1979 Report, the planning for another highway through the area was needed because of (1) “[t]he inadequate physical elements of 
-43­        
        
         
        
             
        
        
        
      
        
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the existing [Mâmalahoa H]ighway[,]” (2) “[h]igh accident rates”
 
on the Mâmalahoa Highway, (3) “[a]nticipated higher traffic
 volume and congestion[,]” (4) the “improvement of a route
 continuously around the island[,]” and (5) the “County land use
 policy[.]” 
The 1982 Kona Regional Plan also indicated the need for
 
improvements to the existing roadway infrastructure. In
 particular, the 1982 Kona Regional Plan stated, in part, that:
 
The traffic counts at all recording stations show large
growth in recent years. Available data indicates that this
 growth has nearly doubled the traffic volume from Captain
Cook to Keauhou . . . . The rapid growth has placed heavy
burdens on the roadway network, increasing both travel time
and inconvenience. The community survey indicates that the
deteriorating traffic situation is viewed as a major problem
by 33% of the persons polled .
 
(Emphasis added.) 
A DOT Hawai' i Long Range Land Transportation Plan, dated 
May 1998, also included a new two-lane highway including 
intersection improvements from “Alii Highway terminus to [the] Mâmalahoa [Highway]/Napoopoo Road intersection,”
18 and then 
“widen[ing] [the] (proposed) two-lane highway to four lanes[.]” 
In sum, these traffic studies and general plans
 
presented at trial recognized (1) that there would be a projected
 increase in the volume of traffic between Keauhou and Captain
 Cook, (2) that the projected volume of traffic would exceed the
 capacity of the existing Mâmalahoa Highway, and (3) that a Bypass
 highway would result in a reduction of the traffic congestion on
 
18
 The intersection of M âmalahoa Highway and N âpô'ôpo'o Road is
 
located in Captain Cook, Hawai 'i.

      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Mâmalahoa Highway. None of these FOFs were challenged on appeal. 
Thus, the Kona Regional Plan, the Hawai' i Council General Plan, 
and other traffic studies conducted by the County and the State indicate that a proposed Bypass was contemplated even prior to the Development Agreement. 
i.
 
(a)
 
Instead, on appeal, Coupe challenges FOF 15 in the
 
court’s First Amended FOFCOL and Supplemental FOF 17 in the
 court’s Supplemental FOFCOL as to Condemnation 2. FOF 15 states:
 
15. County Ordinance Number 96-8 amended 94-73 to include a
shift in the alignment of the bypass highway from Kuakini
Highway to the “appropriate vicinity of Keauhou.”
 
(Citation omitted.)
 
Ordinance 96-8 declared that it is “an ordinance 
amending section 25-87 (North Kona Zone Map) and Section 25-88 
(South Kona Zone Map), Article 3, Chapter 25 (Zoning Code) of the Hawai'i County Code, and Ordinance No. 94-73, which classified 
certain lands from agricultural (A-5a) and unplanned (U) to Agricultural (A-1a)[.]” (Formatting altered.) (Emphasis added.) As indicated in Ordinance 96-8, prior to its adoption, Section 3 of Ordinance 25-87 provided that the district classification was conditioned upon numerous conditions, one of which was construction of the Bypass. Among other amendments made, Ordinance 96-8 amended Ordinance 25-87 Section 3 (L)(2) and Section (L)(3), by removing all references to an Exhibit “C” which established the bypass location and amending the text to 
-45­        
       
       
          
        
       
   
      
      
      
     
      
      
       
        
     
      
      
       
      
      
       
       
   
     
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
allow for the alignment of the Bypass “between the approximate
 
vicinity of Keauhou and Captain Cook[.]” Ordinance 96-8 also
 deleted section (L)(4) which specifically designated that the
 north end of the Bypass would intersect with Kuakini Highway. 
Accordingly, Ordinance 96-8 amended Ordinance 25-87 to read in
 part as follows (with deletions in brackets and the new, amended
 language underscored): 
(L) Roadway improvements and access(es) to the subject
property, including all plans and construction, shall meet
with the approval of the Department of Public Works. Prior
 to the issuance of Final Subdivision Approval for any
portion of the subject property, the applicant shall:
 
. . . .
 (2)	 determine the final right-of-way alignment of
the entire M âmalahoa Highway Bypass [road as
shown in Exhibit “C”,] [sic] between the
approximate vicinity of Keauhou and Captain
Cook, including its intersection areas and its
acquired ownership or control. . . .
 
(3)	 construct [Phase One of] the M âmalahoa Highway
 
Bypass [as shown in Exhibit “C”,] [sic] in its
entirety between the approximate vicinity of
Keauhou and Captain Cook , consisting of two
lanes with sufficient right-of-way for a total
of four lanes , provided further that the section
of the M âmalahoa Highway Bypass between Keauhou
and Halekii Street shall be completed and
available for public use prior to the occupancy
of any dwelling unit within the entire project
area;
[(4)	 construct the channelization improvements
on Kuakini Highway at its intersection
with the north end of the M âmalahoa
 
Bypass;]
 
In light of the foregoing amendments, the court’s FOF 15 that
 
“Ordinance Number 96-8 amended 94-73 to include a shift in the
 alignment of the bypass highway from Kuakini Highway to the
 ‘appropriate vicinity of Keauhou’” was not clearly erroneous.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(b)
 
Supplemental FOF 17 states: 
17. The [c]ourt finds that the alignment of the Bypass
Highway from Keauhou to Captain Cook that was identified in
Ordinances 96-7 and 96-8 . . . is consistent with the 1989
 General Plan.
 
Both Ordinances 96-719 and 96-8 required as a condition of the 
change in district classification, that the applicant determine 
the final right of away alignment of and construct the Bypass “between the approximate vicinity of Keauhou and Captain Cook[.]” A review of the 1998 General Plan Facilities Map indicates that the 1998 General Plan anticipated the proposed arterial highway from Keauhou to Captain Cook. A bypass “between the approximate vicinity of Keauhou and Captain Cook,” as described in Ordinances 96-7 and 96-8, is consistent with the anticipated bypass designated in the 1998 General Plan Facilities Map. Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the court’s finding, and, thus, Supplemental FOF 17 is not clearly erroneous. In re 
Water Use Applications, 94 Hawai' i at 119, 9 P.3d at 431. 
ii.
 
In sum, the court’s findings support the conclusion
 
that (1) numerous plans and studies conducted prior to the
 Development Agreement recognized the need and anticipated the
 
19
 Ordinance 96-7 Section 3 amended, among others, Section 25-88, 
Article 3, Chapter 25 (Zoning Code) of the Hawai 'i County Code to reflect the
change in district classification of the target property. Similar to 
Ordinance 96-8, discussed in relevant part above, Ordinance 96-7 alsocontained, among other conditions, a requirement for “[r]oadway improvements and access(es) to the subject property” identical to Ordinance 96-8 Section 3 (L), including the identical “ between the approximate vicinity of Keauhou and 
Captain Cook ” language.

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
construction of a Bypass between Keauhou and Captain Cook and
 
(2) Ordinances 96-7 and 96-8 were consistent with the County of
 Hawaii’s 1998 General Plan. Hence, Coupe’s assertion that
 Condemnation 2 was not part of a general integrated plan is
 incorrect.
20
 
C.	 Coupe’s Challenge to the Valuation of the Property in
Condemnation 2
 
As to Coupe’s third argument, Coupe posits that the
 
valuation of the property taken in Condemnation 2 did not account
 
for the increase in appreciation during the time between
 Condemnation 1 and Condemnation 2. According to Coupe, the court
 erred in concluding that the County’s appraiser “determined that
 the value of the land did not appreciate between Condemnation 1
 and Condemnation 2” when in fact “the appraiser testified that
 the land appreciated by 239% in that time.” Thus, Coupe
 maintains that the property should be valued at $387,669.54
 rather than $162,204.83. 
In response, the County asserts, first, that “Coupe’s
 
contention is untimely because it reargued the issue of just
 compensation after the trial on this issue was completed and it
 was not one of the issues remanded back to the [court.]” Second,
 
20
 Because the Bypass is consistent with the 1998 General Plan,
 
Coupe’s argument that there is “no evidence that Resolution 31-03 was part of
a carefully considered and integrated plan” is incorrect. Thus, this court
need not address Coupe’s arguments that the Development Agreement could not
serve as a comprehensive plan because (1) it was a “private development
 agreement” which was “merely a contract between a developer and the local
government in which the government agrees to not apply future land use
regulations against the property for a period of time,” and (2) the
 Development Agreement was illegal and void.
 
-48­        
         
     
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the County argues that the just compensation amount for the
 
property was “appropriate” because “[t]here is nothing improper
 of [sic] this [c]ourt finally deciding on a value of $140,500
 (which is between the ranges testified to by [experts] Medusky
 and Bloom [at trial]).” 
In reply to the County, Coupe argues that valuation of
 
the property was “sufficiently preserved . . . by raising as
 error the pretextual nature of the taking in Condemnation 2”
 because Coupe “prevailed on the pretext issue in Coupe I, and
 jurisdiction was once again vested in the trial court for further
 consideration”; even if the valuation issue was not raised in the
 prior appeal, this court “vacated the trial court’s entire
 previous judgment in Condemnation 2” and “[a]s a result, . . .
 the parties were returned to their respective prejudgment
 positions”; “all that was required of [Coupe] was that [it]
 preserve the issue by objecting below, which [it] did”; and this
 court may “sua sponte notice and consider points of plain error
 where substantial rights may be affected, even if not properly
 raised on appeal or preserved below.” 
1. 	Whether the Valuation Issue was Untimely
 
The record is clear that the court determined just
 
compensation for the property in Condemnation 2 prior to the
 first appeal to this court in Coupe I. The court’s First Amended
 FOFCOL and Order included the following relevant findings: 
121.	 The [c]ourt finds that the fair market value of the
Property in [Condemnation 1] is $140,500.
 
122.	 For [Condemnation 1], based on the fair market value
 
-49­        
         
        
         
        
        
          
        
     
       
       
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of the land sought to be taken, the blight damage
percentage is set at 10% per annum, and damages
computed from October 9, 2000 to January 28, 2005.
The [c]ourt finds that four years, three months, and
nineteen days have elapsed between the two dates.
With the percentage set at 10% per annum, and with the
fair market value of the Property in [Condemnation 1]
at $140,500, blight damages are $60,443.87.
 
123.	 The  [c]ourt  finds  that  the  fair  market  value  of  the
Property  in  [Condemnation  2]  is  $162,204.83.
 
124.	 For  [Condemnation  2],  based  on  the  fair  market  value
of  the  land  sought  to  be  taken,  the  blight  damage
percentage  is  set  at  10%  per  annum,  and  computed  from
January  28,  2005  until  date  paid.
   
. . . .
 
1
26.	 Just compensation for [Condemnation 2] shall be as
follows: $ 162,204.83 (fair market value) plus 10%
(blight damages) per annum until paid.
 
(Emphases added.) On September 27, 2007, the court entered its
 
First Amended Final Judgment, stating in part, “Just compensation
 for the condemnation of the [p]roperty in [Condemnation 2] is
 $162,204.83. Additionally, [b]light of [s]ummons damage from
 January 28, 2005 to the time of payment shall be 10% per annum.” 
On February 8, 2008, Coupe filed its first notice of appeal, and
 on July 9, 2008, this court accepted transfer from the ICA in
 Coupe I. Coupe had the opportunity to challenge the evidentiary
 valuation of the property in its first appeal to this court, but
 did not do so. Therefore, Coupe’s just compensation challenge is
 untimely. 
2. 	Whether Coupe Preserved the Valuation Issue by
Challenging the Pretextual Nature of
Condemnation 2
 
Coupe argues that it preserved the valuation issue when
 
it raised the pretext defense in 
Coupe I. However, a pretext
 
defense is distinct from a just compensation challenge. A
 
challenge to just compensation assumes a valid taking but
 
-50­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
challenges the valuation amount for the property.21 On the other
 
hand, the pretext defense asserts that a private person's
 
constitutional right was violated because his or her property was
 not taken for a public purpose, but as pretext for a primarily
 private benefit. Coupe I, 119 Hawai' i at 384, 198 P.3d at 647 
(recognizing that a “[c]ity would no doubt be forbidden . . . to
 take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when
 its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit” (citing Kelo,
 545 U.S. at 477-78)) (citations omitted). A taking for a private
 benefit violates the “public use” requirement under the Fifth
 Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 20 of
 the Hawai' i Constitution, irrespective of whether just 
compensation was paid for the property. See Kelo, 545 U.S. at
 477 (“[I]t has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take
 the property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to
 another private party B, even though A is paid just
 compensation.”). Hence, a determination that an alleged public
 
21 See  Hawaii  Hous.  Auth.  v.  Midkiff,  69  Haw.  247,  249,  739  P.2d  248,
 
249  (1987)  (stating  that,  under  “equitable  principles[,]”  “a  proper  measure  by
which  to  ascertain  the  additional  amount  necessary  to  put  the  defendant  in  as
good  [a]  position  pecuniarily  as  he  would  have  been  had  his  property  not  been
taken”  would  “require[]  the  payment  of  just  compensation  contemporaneously
with  the  taking,  and  interest  at  a  reasonable  rate  on  .  .  .  the  value  of  the
property  from  that  date  until  paid”  (citing  Honolulu  v.  Lord,  36  Haw.  348,  354
(Haw.  Terr.  1943))  (emphases  added);  City  &  County  of  Honolulu  v.  Market
Place,  Ltd.,  55  Haw.  226,  247,  517  P.2d  7,  22  (1973)   (“A  major  goal  of  the
valuation  process  in  eminent  domain  proceedings  is  to  determine  market
conditions  for  the  taken  property  as  though  no  condemnation  had  ever  been
contemplated.”   (Citing  State  v.  Heirs  of  Kapahi,  48  Haw.  101,  113,  395  P.2d
932,  939  (1964);  Territory  v.  Am.  Sec.  Bank,  43  Haw.  167  (1959).))   (Emphasis
 
added.).   In  a  just  compensation  challenge,  a  landowner  argues  that  his  or  her
constitutional  right  was  violated  because  the  compensation  he  or  she  received
was  not  fair  or  adequate.   See  State  by  Atty.  Gen.  v.  Midkiff,  55  Haw.  190,
195,  516  P.2d  1250,  1254  (1973)  (recognizing  that  “the  test  of  fairness  .  .  .
 
is  fundamental  to  a  determination  of  just  compensation”).
 
-51­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
purpose was a pretext will constitute an unlawful taking, even
 
though the landowner is justly compensated for the property. 
Inasmuch as the issue of just compensation is not relevant to the
 determination of a pretext defense, Coupe's pretext defense did
 not “preserve[]” Coupe's just compensation challenge of the
 property in Condemnation 2. 
3. 	Whether this Court’s Remand in Coupe I Allows
Coupe to Challenge the Valuation of the Property
Taken in Condemnation 2
 
Additionally, Coupe argues that it could challenge the 
just compensation amount because Coupe I returned the parties to 
their “respective prejudgment positions.” This argument is also unavailing. In Coupe I, this court remanded both condemnation proceedings for the court to make two determinations: (1) “a decision on [Coupe’s] motion for statutory damages,” Coupe I, 119 Hawai'i at 389, 198 P.3d at 652, and (2) a decision on “whether 
the asserted public purpose was pretextual[,]” id. at 390, 198 P.3d at 653. As discussed above, a pretextual defense does not implicate a just condemnation challenge. Similarly, the motion for statutory damages under HRS § 101-27 in this case does not implicate the valuation of the property. Thus, this court did not remand on any issue concerning just compensation. The just compensation value of the property taken in Condemnation 2, then, was not open to litigation on remand. See Standard Mgmt. Inc. v. Kekona, 99 Hawai' i 125, 137, 53 P.3d 264, 276 (App. 2001) 
(“[R]emand for a specific act does not reopen the entire case; 
-52­        
          
            
               
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the lower tribunal only has the authority to carry out the
 
appellate court’s mandate.”) (Citation omitted.) 
4. Whether this Court Can Notice Plain Error
 
Finally, Coupe contends that this court should sua
 
sponte address the just compensation issue based on plain error. 
The three factors necessary for this court to take plain error
 review in a civil case are “[(1)] whether the consideration of
 the issue requires additional facts, [(2)] whether the resolution
 of the question will affect the integrity of the findings of fact
 of the trial court[,] and [(3)] whether the question is of great
 public import.” Fujioka v. Kam, 55 Haw. 7, 9, 514 P.2d 568, 570
 (1973) (citations omitted).
22 In the instant case, Coupe’s
 
challenge to just compensation does not meet the third factor. 
Whether the court correctly valued the property in Condemnation 2
 is not of general public importance. 
The just compensation value
 
of the property applies exclusively to the specific parcel of
 Coupe’s property being taken in Condemnation 2 and, thus, is
 solely a matter of private interest. Inasmuch as the third
 factor is not present here, plain error cannot be noticed.
 
IV.	 ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ISSUES
 
ASSOCIATED WITH CONDEMNATION 1 IN COUPE’S SECOND APPEAL
 
With respect to Coupe’s attorneys’ fees and cost
 
arguments, Coupe argues that the court erred when it concluded,

 This court has also recently confirmed this test in Alvarez Family 
Trust v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Kaanapali Alii , 121 Hawai 'i 474, 490,

dissenting, joined by Duffy, J.). 
-53­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as a matter of law, that (1) “the Coupes were not entitled to
 
recover damages under [HRS §] 101-27 for their efforts to obtain
 . . . attorneys’ fees for preparing the damages motions and
 litigating the same[,]” and (2) the Coupes were not entitled to
 prejudgment interest, that is, “the damages [Coupe] incurred in
 not having the free use of [its] money for the nine years in
 which the defense of Condemnation 1 tied up [its] funds.” 
A.	 The Denial of Attorneys’ Fees Associated With the
Preparation of Billing Records and/or Preparation of
Coupe’s Fee Petitions
 
As discussed supra, Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion 
requested additional damages that were not included in its 
initial October 11, 2007 Motion. On May 14, 2009, the court issued an Order granting Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion but excluded $75,384.00 in attorneys’ fees, which were associated with “the preparation of billing records for [Coupe’s] fee petition and/or preparation of [Coupe’s] fee petitions[.]” Coupe challenges the court’s denial of these attorneys’ fees. According to Coupe, the court’s determination is contrary to the holding in Coupe I which awarded Coupe damages “including attorneys [sic] fees and costs which were incurred in applying for the damage award[.]” Also, Coupe challenges the court’s reliance on Hawai' i Ventures, arguing that it “[wa]s not an 
eminent domain case, and did not involve [HRS §] 101-27, and thus has nothing to say about whether [it] . . . is entitled to recover all the attorneys [sic] fees and costs it incurred[.]” 
-54­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In its answering brief, the County maintains that 
“[g]enerally, there shall be no recovery for fees and expenses 
incurred in litigating the propriety of the fees to be awarded pursuant to [Hawai' i Ventures].” In its reply brief, Coupe 
essentially reiterates the arguments made in its opening brief. 
1. 	Coupe’s Argument that This Court has Awarded Such
Fees and Costs under HRS § 101-27
 
“The trial court’s grant or denial of attorneys’ fees 
and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.” 
Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 105, 
176 P.3d 91, 104 (2008) (quoting Kahala Royal Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawai' i 251, 266, 151 P.3d 732, 747 
(2007) (citation omitted)) (brackets omitted). Generally, under the “American Rule,” “each party is responsible for paying his or her own litigation expenses[,]” however, “attorney’s fees are chargeable against the opposing party when so authorized by statute, rule of court, agreement, stipulation, or precedent.” Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp. of State of Hawai' i, 120 Hawai 'i 
181, 218, 202 P.3d 1226, 1263 (2009) (quoting Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng’g & Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai' i 37, 50-51, 951 P.2d 487, 
500-01 (1998)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
In Coupe II, this court was presented with the 
threshold question of “whether ‘all such damage’ under HRS § 101-27 provide[d] adequate authority for [Coupe’s] request for attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal and, if so, to what extent.” 120 Hawai' i at 404, 208 P.3d at 717. This court stated that, 
-55­        
         
            
       
           
        
         
        
           
          
      
          
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“[b]y its plain language, HRS § 101-27 appears to provide a
 
sufficient basis for the award of damages in the form of costs
 and attorney's fees sustained as a result of [Coupe’s] appeal of
 the automatic denial of fees in Condemnation 1.” Id. at 404-05,
 
208 P.3d at 717-18. Further, it was concluded that HRS § 101-27
 encompassed damages sustained “in seeking fees and costs owed”:
 
The statutory language “all such damage . . . sustained
. . . by reason of the bringing of the proceedings,” on its
 face would appear to encompass what [Coupe] seeks
herein. . . . Had the County not brought the unsuccessful
proceedings in Condemnation 1, [Coupe] would never have had
cause to move for fees and to subsequently appeal.
Therefore, the “damage” sustained by [Coupe] in seeking the
fees and costs owed and in appealing the denial of such fees
and costs, was part of the damage resulting from the County
having brought the unsuccessful proceedings in Condemnation
1. Consequently, under HRS § 101-27, the County should be
held liable for “such damage.”
 
Id. at 405, 208 P.3d at 718 (emphasis added) (brackets and
 
footnote omitted) (some ellipsis in original and some added).
 
Similar to the reasoning in Coupe II, had the County
 
not brought the unsuccessful proceeding in Condemnation 1, Coupe
 would not have had cause to move for fees or to litigate the
 amount of fees on remand. Thus, the expenses Coupe sustained in
 seeking those fees and costs resulted from the County having
 brought the unsuccessful proceeding in Condemnation 1. 
Consequently, the County is liable for these damages under HRS
 § 101-27.

II Response further supports this position.23 As discussed in
 
Coupe II, Coupe did not request “the damages it incurred in
 
filing or preparing the [Coupe II] Request and [the Coupe II]
 Response” in its Coupe II Request but waited until its Coupe II
 Response to do so. Coupe II, 120 Hawai' i at 414, 208 P.3d at 727 
(brackets omitted). While Coupe’s request was ultimately denied,
 it was not because this court concluded that there was no
 recovery for fees and expenses incurred in litigating the
 propriety of the attorneys’ fees and costs claimed. 
Rather, this
 
court stated that Coupe “did not expressly request attorneys’
 fees for preparing the [Coupe II] Request in its original
 Request, nor did it provide supporting documentation”; “upon
 filing the [Coupe II] Response and requesting fees for preparing
 that Response, [Coupe] again did not provide any supporting
 documentation as required by HRAP Rule 39(d)(1)”;
24
  and although
23 As stated in Coupe II , Coupe filed its Coupe II Request for 
Statutory Damages on January 20, 2009, and the County filed a memorandum in
opposition to this request on January 30, 2009. 120 Hawai 'i at 403, 208 P.3d 
at 716. Pursuant to this court’s order, on February 19, 2009, Coupe filed itsCoupe II Response to the County’s memorandum, and thereafter, on March 2,
2009, the County filed its reply. Id. On March 5, 2009, Coupe filed an 
Errata “to correct certain errors in the [ Coupe II ] [R]equest and [ Coupe II ]
[R]esponse[.]” Id. 
24 HRAP Rule 39(d)(1) states:
 
(d) Request for Fees and Costs; Objections.
(1) A party who desires an award of attorney's fees
and costs shall request them by submitting an itemized and
verified bill of fees and costs, together with a statement
of authority for each category of items and, where
appropriate, copies of invoices, bills, vouchers, and
receipts. Requests for indigent fees and necessary expenses
shall be submitted in a form that substantially complies
with Form 7 in the Appendix of Forms and shall be
accompanied by a copy of the order appointing counsel.
Requests for non-indigent attorney's fees and costs allowed
(continued...)
 
-57­        
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Coupe later “filed the requisite itemized account of attorneys’ 
fees in its Errata, [Coupe] d[id] not provide this court with any rationale as to why it should be permitted to essentially raise new substantive arguments for the first time in an Errata.” Id. 
at 414, 208 P.3d at 727 (citing Taomae v. Lingle, 110 Hawai' i 327, 
333, 132 P.3d 1238, 1244 (2006)). As apparent from this court’s discussion in Coupe II, that decision left open the possibility that damages sustained in preparing and litigating the propriety of fees could be recovered under HRS § 101-27. 
2. 	Coupe’s Argument that Hawai' i Ventures is 
Inapposite 
The court, in its May 14, 2009 order granting in part 
Coupe’s March 20, 2009 Motion, and the County in its answering brief, rely on Hawai' i Ventures for the proposition that “fees and 
expenses incurred in litigating the propriety of the fees to be awarded” cannot be recovered. In Hawai' i Ventures, a receiver was 
appointed to manage a hotel pending a foreclosure sale. 116 Hawai'i at 468, 173 P.3d 1125. The circuit court appointed a 
special master to review the receiver’s final report, and entered a deficiency judgment. Id. All parties appealed the circuit 
court’s decision and challenged the actions taken by the receiver. Id. On appeal, this court affirmed the circuit 
24(...continued)
by  statute  or  contract  shall  be  submitted  in  a  form  that
substantially  complies  with  Form  8  in  the  Appendix  of  Forms.
A  failure  to  provide  authority  for  the  award  of  attorney's
fees  and  costs  or  necessary  expenses  will  result  in  denial
of  that  request.
 
(
Emphasis added.)
 
-58­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s final judgment in part but “vacated ‘the awards of fees
 
to the [r]eceiver and her professionals reflected in certain of
 the circuit court orders’ and remanded the fee orders to the
 circuit court ‘for clarification and, if necessary, a
 redetermination of the amount[.]’” Id. at 469, 173 P.3d at 1126
 
(brackets omitted). The receiver then filed a request for
 reimbursement of fees and costs she incurred on appeal. 
This court stated, inter alia, that “the [r]eceiver and
 
her professionals are not entitled to compensation for work
 performed in relation to the defense of fees issue.” Id. at 476,
 173 P.3d at 1133. To support this position, this court quoted
 United States v. Larchwood Gardens, Inc., 420 F.2d 531, 534 (3d
 Cir. 1970), which stated that, “the law imposes on a party the
 duty to pay [her] own fees and expenses in vindicating [her]
 personal interests. . . . It is our understanding that services
 necessarily involved in preparing [fee] application [sic] to the
 district court and defending them are not compensable.” Id.
 
(brackets and ellipsis in original). 
While, as indicated in Hawai' i Ventures, receivers in 
foreclosure proceedings are “not entitled to recover fees and expenses associated with litigation involving the propriety of the fees to be awarded to them,” 114 Hawai' i at 497-98, 164 P.3d 
at 755-56, the specific question here is whether Coupe is entitled to fees and costs for litigating the propriety of fees under HRS § 101-27. Hawai' i Ventures was not an eminent domain 
-59­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
case, and it did not decide whether HRS § 101-27 may entitle a 
landowner to attorneys’ fees expended because of the government’s unsuccessful attempt to condemn property. As discussed supra, Coupe II did not bar Coupe’s ability to seek damages “sustained by [Coupe] in seeking the fees and costs [it is] owed[.]” 120 Hawai'i at 404-05, 208 P.3d at 717-18. Our holding herein is 
limited to the specific circumstances of HRS § 101-27 involved in litigating disputes as to fees and costs recoverable because of a failed condemnation. 
Because the court incorrectly determined that “there
 
shall be no recovery for fees and expenses incurred in litigating
 the propriety of fees” under HRS § 101-27, the court based its
 ruling on an “erroneous view of the law” and, therefore, abused
 its discretion in failing to consider whether Coupe was entitled
 to these attorneys’ fees. Because the court did not reach the
 question of the reasonableness of these fees, the case must be
 remanded to the court to determine the extent to which the
 $75,384 of attorneys’ fees associated with preparing the billing
 records and Coupe’s fee petitions were reasonable and should be
 awarded. 
B. 	Coupe’s Request for Prejudgment Interest on Its
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs for Condemnation 1
 
As to argument (2), Coupe asserts that the County
 
“never argued that [prejudgment] interest [wa]s not properly
 
awardable under [HRS §] 101-27,” “never contested [Coupe’s]
 calculation of an approximate award nor the applicable rate,”
 
-60­        
         
           
       
          
          
        
    
    
         
        
        
         
          
           
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and, therefore, has “waived any arguments not made[.]” Coupe 
thus contends that “[t]he court should not have interposed its own objection [to awarding prejudgment interest], when [the] County made none.” (Citing Wong v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai' i 46, 53, 
961 P.2d 611, 618 (1998).). Coupe also maintains that COL 33
25 of 
the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages is erroneous because HRS § 101-27 “must include the cost of funds encumbered by a failed condemnation attempt”; “[t]he loss of the use of [Coupe’s] money over nine years of Condemnation 1 must be a recoverable element of [HRS §] 101-27 damages” or else it 
“prevents [Coupe] from being made truly whole” (citing 
Lucas v. 
Liggert & Myers Tobacco Co., 51 Haw. 346, 348, 461 P.2d 140, 143 (1969)); the governing statute for prejudgment interest in this case is HRS § 101-27 and not the prejudgment interest statute, 
26
  HRS § 636-16 (1993); even if HRS § 636-16 does apply, the court
“wrongly rejected [] Coupe’s damage claim, because nine years is
 by any reasonable measure a substantial delay in the proceedings
 
25 COL 33 of the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages
 
states:
 
33. This [c]ourt finds there is no legal nor factual basis
for the $276,762.41 in prejudgment interest sought as
damages under [HRS] § 101-27 as there is no allegations ofundue delay by Plaintiff County. See also [Coupe II , 120 
Hawai'i at 410-11, 208 P.3d at 723-24] (denying [Coupe’s]
request for prejudgment interest). 
HRS § 636-16 provides that
 
[i]n awarding interest [on a judgment] in civil cases, the
judge is authorized to designate the commencement date to
conform with the circumstances of each case, provided that
the earliest commencement date in cases arising in tort, may
be the date when the injury first occurred and in cases
arising by breach of contract, it may be the date when the
breach first occurred.

and issuance of judgment” (citing Ditto v. McCurdy, 86 Hawai' i 93, 
114, 947 P.2d 961, 982 (App. 1997)); and that “[the court]
 
wrongly placed the burden on [Coupe] to allege ‘undue delay by
 
27
 Plaintiff County’”  (quoting COL 33 of the court’s Supplemental
FOFCOL on Statutory Damages). 
In reply to the County, Coupe
 
contends that the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory
 Damages demonstrate that the County has waived any objection on
 the issue of encumbered funds
28 and an award will not result in a
 
windfall because “[t]he loss of use of funds is per se damage
 under [HRS §] 101-27, and the Coupes are entitled to be made
 whole.” 
27 The County counters, arguing that “[t]he County always opposed any
 
damages except those that may be reasonable under HRS § 101-27”; that “[Coupe]
do[es] not cite any case or statutory authority that the cost of encumbered
funds relating to attorneys’ fees and costs is allowed . . . under either HRS
 § 101-27 or HRS § 636-16”; that Coupe has not “explained a rational basis to
allow such an award based on the final attorneys’ fee award where the billing
 for the attorneys’ work was done over a nine year period”; and that Coupe’s
prejudgment interest claim was properly denied “[b]ecause [Coupe has] not
alleged undue delay by the County as to the payment of attorneys’ fees, either
in its pleadings or initial filing of its Motion for Statutory Damages, or
proved it[.]”
 
28 Throughout its opening brief, Coupe asserts that it is entitled to
 
damages “in the form of the cost of encumbered funds.” Subsequently, Coupe
 also used the term “encumbered funds” in its reply brief to the County. Coupe
 does not specifically define the term “encumbered funds[,]” but states that
 the “encumbered funds represented damage suffered with each invoice related to
Condemnation 1 since October 2000 . . . until [Coupe] received payment for
[its] injuries in August 2009” and “include those [damages] resulting from the
loss of free use of funds which were tied up by the defense of Condemnation
1.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term encumbrance as “[a] claim or
liability that is attached to property or some right and that may lessen its
value, such as a lien or mortgage; any property right that is not an ownership
interest.” Black’s Law Dictionary 607 (9th ed. 2004).
Coupe  acknowledges  that  “[t]he  [c]ourt  characterized  this  [loss  of
use  of  funds]  claim  as  prejudgment  interest[.]”   According  to  Coupe’s
memorandum  in  support  of  it  October  11,  2007  request,  Coupe  requested
“[p]rejudgment  interest  (10%  per  annum  from  date  of  each  bill)  on  those  fees,
and  the  associated  costs  is  proper  because  those  fees  are  ‘damages’  under
 
[HRS]  §  101-27[.]”   Coupe  does  not  state  when  Coupe  paid  these  invoices,  if  at
 
all.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1. 	Whether the County has Waived its Objections
to Coupe’s Request for Prejudgment Interest
 
Coupe first argues that the denial of prejudgment
 
29 30 
 interest damages “cannot be reconciled with” FOF 37  and 38  and
 
COL 731 in the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages,
 
which, according to Coupe, “reveal [that the] County waived [the]
 
objection” to Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest. Coupe
 urges this court to conclude that the first sentence in
 Supplemental FOF 38, which states that the “County has [] never
 argued in this [c]ourt that such interest is not properly
 awardable as damages under [HRS §] 101-27[,]” shows that the
 County has waived its objection. 
However, Supplemental FOF 38, when read in its
 
entirety, indicates that while the County did not argue that
 “[prejudgment] interest [was] not properly awardable as damages
 under [HRS §] 101-27[,]” the County did instead argue that “‘any
 
29 FOF 37 of the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages
 
states that the “County contests neither the calculation of interest nor the
applicable rate.”
 
30 In FOF 38 of the Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages, the
 
court found as follows:
 
38. County has also never argued in this [c]ourt that such
interest is not properly awardable as damages under [HRS
§] 101-27. Instead, County has argued only that “any award
under HRS § 101-27 should be limited to amounts paid for the
improper delegation of condemnation power defense in the
first case.”
 
(Citation omitted.)
 
31
 COL 7 of the court’s Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages
 
states that the “County has waived any and all arguments and any new evidence
that it did not previously raise in its prior oppositions to [Coupe’s] Motion.
The last allowable pleading submitted was December 19, 2007.” (Citation
 omitted.)
 
-63­        
       
         
        
           
         
        
        
          
      
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
award under HRS § 101-27 should be limited to amounts paid for
 
the improper delegation of condemnation power defense in the
 first case.’” (Emphasis added.) (Citation omitted.) Thus, the
 County challenged Coupe’s prejudgment interest claim inasmuch as
 the prejudgment interest was not an “amount[] paid for the
 improper delegation of condemnation power defense in the first
 case.” Consequently, the County’s argument that it did object to
 Coupe’s prejudgment interest claim is correct. 
2. 	Whether Prejudgement Interest is Mandatory
under HRS § 101-27
 
Coupe interprets HRS § 101-27 as mandating the recovery 
of prejudgment interest via the phrase “all such damage as may 
have been sustained by the defendant by reason of the bringing of the proceedings.” However, the plain language of HRS § 101-27 indicates that the “recovery of damages under HRS § 101-27” is not mandatory, as Coupe asserts, but “subject to a reasonableness requirement.” Coupe II, 120 Hawai' i at 411, 208 P.3d at 724. 
As explained in Coupe II, the words in HRS § 101-27,
 
includ[ing] “the defendant’s costs of court, a reasonable
amount to cover attorney’s fees paid by the defendant in
connection therewith, and other reasonable expenses[]” . . .
 is essentially a list of items that are to be included in
the damage award. Thus, the phrase “and other reasonable
 
expenses,” assumes that the previous items listed are also
types of reasonable expenses[,] . . . [because interpreting
HRS § 101-27 as commanding the grant of] all costs “actually
 incurred,” regardless of reasonableness, renders the term
 
“other” superfluous.
 
Id. (citing Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 255, 195 
P.2d 1177, 1187 (2008)) (emphases omitted). Hence, a request for 
prejudgment interest under HRS § 101-27 may be granted if it is 
-64­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
an “other reasonable expense[].” See HRS § 101-27; Coupe II, 120 
Hawai'i at 411, 208 P.3d at 724. 
However, the plain language of the provision does not 
clarify whether prejudgment interest is an “other reasonable 
expense[].” Nor does the statute define the term. Therefore, this court may look to the legislative history in construing the statute. See Hawaii Providers Network, Inc. v. AIG Hawaii Ins. 
Co., 105 Hawai' i 362, 369, 98 P.3d 233, 240 (2004) (recognizing 
that “[w]hen there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of expression used in a statute[,] an ambiguity [exists,]” and, thus, “courts may take legislative history into consideration in construing a statute”) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted). The legislative history recognized that, “at times [when] condemnation proceedings are instituted but are not prosecuted to final judgment, the owners of the property involved thereby suffer[] loss for which there is no means now provided [by] which they may be compensated.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 622, in 1929 House Journal, at 1400. To remedy this situation, the legislature amended the eminent domain statutes for the purpose of “giv[ing] to persons whose property is sought to be condemned, a right of action to recover damages if the condemnation proceedings are dropped before final judgment is reached.” Id. 
Generally, this court has recognized that prejudgment

in payment” which is “measured from the accrual of the claim for 
relief to the time of rendition of the judgment[.]” Rodrigues v. State, 52 Haw. 156, 168, 472 P.2d 509, 518 (1970) (emphasis added). This court has defined prejudgment interest as “‘an element of complete compensation[,]’” Kalawaia v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. 
Co., 90 Hawai' i 167, 172, 977 P.2d 175, 180 (1999) (quoting W. 
Virginia v. United States, 479 U.S. 305, 310 (1987) (citation omitted)), that “serves to compensate for the loss of use of money due as damages . . . , thereby achieving full compensation for the injury those damages are intended to redress[,]” id. (quoting W. Virginia, 479 U.S. at 310 n.2 (citing Comment, Prejudgment Interest: Survey & Suggestion, 77 Nw.U.L.Rev. 192 (1982))) (emphasis added). Thus, it follows that prejudgment interest can be recovered as an “other reasonable expense” under HRS § 101-27. Our holding as to such prejudgment interest is limited to the specific circumstances of a failed condemnation contemplated by HRS § 101-27. 
3.	 Whether Coupe’s Request for Prejudgment
Interest Under HRS § 101-27 was Properly
Denied 
This court must next address whether the court erred in 
denying Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest under the 
circumstances of the case. Prejudgment interest is “awarded at the discretion of the court.” Rodrigues, 52 Haw. at 169, 472 P.2d at 518; see Metcalf v. Voluntary Employees’ Benefit Ass’n of Hawai'i, 99 Hawai' i 53, 61, 52 P.3d 823, 831 (2002) (recognizing 
-66­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that “it is clearly within the discretion of the circuit court to 
deny prejudgment interest where appropriate”). Accordingly, an award of prejudgment interest under HRS § 101-27 should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. Cf. Tri-S Corp. v. W. Worlds Ins. Co., 110 Hawai' i 473, 489, 135 P.3d 82, 98 (2006) 
(recognizing that in the context of HRS § 636-16, “[a]n award of prejudgment interest is reviewed for an abuse of discretion”) (citing Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 136, 839 P.3d 10, 36 (1992)). “‘[T]o constitute an abuse [of discretion,] it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.’” Id. (quoting State v. Sacoco, 45 Haw. 288, 292, 367 P.2d 11, 13 (1961)) (brackets in original). 
Similar to the situation here, Coupe in Coupe II 
contended that “it [was] entitled to [prejudgment] interest from the date of each invoice for attorneys’ fees and costs as a form of damage, pursuant to HRS § 101-27” because “the purpose of a damage award is to put a party in the position they [sic] would have been in had not harm occurred” and that Coupe suffered damage “each time it had to pay its lawyers.” 120 Hawai' i at 410, 
208 P.3d at 723 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). In Coupe II, Coupe argued that “‘[i]nterest from the date of harm is an element of damage and this [c]ourt is authorized to award 
-67­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
pre-judgment interest in all civil actions’ under HRS § 636-16.” 
Id. (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).
 
After considering Coupe’s arguments, this court denied 
Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest. Id. at 411, 208 P.3d at 724. It was recognized that “[p]re-judgment interest may be awarded under HRS § 636-16 in the court’s discretion ‘when the issuance of judgment is greatly delayed for any reason.’” Id. (quoting Tri-S Corp., 110 Hawai' i at 498, 135 P.3d at 107) 
(emphasis in original). However, this court denied Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest on its attorneys’ fees, costs, and excise tax related to Condemnation 1 claimed on appeal under both HRS §§ 101-27 and 636-16 because “[Coupe] ha[d] not asserted . . . any lengthy delay in the issuance of the judgment of attorneys’ fees or costs[.]” Id. 
Similarly, in the instant appeal, it appears that Coupe
 
did not assert any lengthy delay in the issuance of the judgment
 of the attorneys’ fees or costs at the trial level. Coupe, in
 its October 11, 2007 Motion, moved for statutory damages pursuant
 to HRS § 101-27, “in the amount of $1,547,748.80 and costs in the
 amount of $200,226.58, plus tax and prejudgment interest,
 incurred in [Condemnation 1].” Coupe’s only assertion with
 regard to prejudgment interest in its supporting memorandum
 stated, “Prejudgment interest (10% per annum from date of each
 bill) on those fees, and the associated costs is [sic] proper
 because those fees are ‘damages’ under [HRS] § 101-27.” 
-68­        
          
           
            
            
              
            
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Emphasis added.) No claim was made in Coupe’s October 11, 2007 
Motion for statutory damages or in Coupe’s supporting memorandum that there had been any undue delay in the proceedings. Accordingly, the court in the instant case properly cited to Coupe II in COL 33 of its Supplemental FOFCOL on Statutory Damages as support for its conclusion that “there [wa]s no legal or factual basis for the $276,762.41 in prejudgment interest sought as damages under HRS § 101-27[.]”
32 As in Coupe II, Coupe 
again “has not asserted . . . any lengthy delay in the issuance of judgment[,]” 120 Hawai' i at 411, 208 P.3d at 724, and 
therefore, Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest was properly denied. 
This denial of prejudgement interest under HRS § 101-27
 
is also consistent with this court’s interpretation of HRS § 636­
16. HRS § 636-16, which applies in all civil cases, vests a court with discretion to award prejudgment interest. HRS § 636­16 (stating in part that “[i]n awarding interest in civil cases, the judge is authorized to designate the commencement date to conform with the circumstances of each case”); Coupe II, 120 Hawai'i at 410, 208 P.3d 723 (“Pre-judgment interest may be 
awarded under HRS § 63-16 in the court’s discretion[.]”). Consistent with the general definitions of prejudgment interest 
32
 While Coupe now asserts in this appeal that the nine-year period
 
of litigation “is by any reasonable measure a substantial delay in the
proceedings in the issuance of judgment[,]” Coupe does not cite where in the
 record it made this argument to the court. Accordingly, the County asserts
 that “[Coupe] ha[s] not alleged undue delay by the County as to the payment of
attorneys’ fees, either in its pleadings or initial filing of its [October 11,
2007 Motion] or proved it[.]”

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
stated supra, the purpose of prejudgment interest, in the context 
of HRS § 636-16, is to “‘correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of time for any reason, including litigation delays[,]’” Coupe II, 120 Hawai' i at 411, 208 P.3d at 
724 (quoting Tri-S Corp., 110 Hawai' i at 498, 135 P.3d at 107 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)), and “to permit more equitable results and to more speedily resolve cases[,]” Wiegand v. Colbert, 68 Haw. 472, 477, 718 P.2d 1080, 1084 (1986). 
According to 
Tri-S Corp., a finding of fault by one of
 
the parties is not necessary, and a review of an award of
 interest rests on three factors: 
(1) if fault is found on the part of the party seeking
interest, denial of interest will not be considered an abuse
of discretion; (2) if fault is found on the part of the
party opposing interest, an award of interest will not be
considered an abuse of discretion; and (3) where no fault is
found on either side, the trial court may still award or
deny prejudgment interest in its discretion , depending on
the circumstances of the case.
 
110 Hawai' i at 498, 135 P.3d at 107 (emphasis added). Moreover, 
“‘[a] trial court's denial of prejudgment interest is usually 
affirmed’ if the requesting party caused the delay or the opposing party did not cause the delay.” Id. (quoting Page v. Domino’s Pizza, Inc., 80 Hawai' i 204, 209, 908 P.2d 552, 557 (App. 
1995) (citations omitted)) (brackets in original). However, “‘a trial court can award prejudgment interest for any substantial delay in the proceedings, and [] no purposeful delay on the part of the non-moving party is required.’” Id. (quoting Ditto, 86 Hawai'i at 114, 947 P.2d at 982) (emphases in original). 
-70­        
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In any event, because there is no fault found on the
 
part of either Coupe or the County, the court had discretion to
 
deny Coupe’s prejudgment interest claim under the circumstances
 of the case. See id. As discussed above, the record reflects
 
there was no argument to the court below or to this court, that
 there has been a delay attributable to the County’s fault. 
Moreover, the County did not argue that there has been any delay
 caused by Coupe. Hence, neither party argued to the court that
 there was a purposeful delay on the part of any party, nor did
 the court find such purposeful delay.
33 Furthermore, Coupe did
 
not assert specifically where in the span of nine years the
 substantial delay occurred.
 
Given the circumstances, it cannot be said that the
 
court “clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded the
 rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
 detriment of [Coupe.]” Id. (quoting Sacoco, 45 Haw. at 292, 367
 
P.2d at 13). The court’s denial of Coupe’s request for
 prejudgment interest was not an abuse of discretion, and thus,
 the court did not err in denying Coupe’s request for prejudgment
 
interest under HRS § 101-27. 
V. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, (1) the court’s conclusion that
 
Condemnation 2 was not pretextual, (2) the valuation of just
 
compensation set for the property in Condemnation 2, and (3) the
 
33
 See supra note 25.
 
-71­        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
denial of Coupe’s request for prejudgment interest, are affirmed. 
However, the case must be remanded for a determination of Coupe’s
 request for attorneys’ fees associated with the preparation of
 billing records and/or preparation of Coupe’s fee petitions in
 Condemnation 1.
