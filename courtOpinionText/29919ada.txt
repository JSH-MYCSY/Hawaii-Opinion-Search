FEBRUARY 10, 2010
MOON, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, DUFFY, AND RECKTENWALD, JJ.
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
We hold that 1) the plain language and construction of
§ 3-3 of the Charter of the County of Maui (CCM) requires a***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.1
2mandatory and immediate forfeiture of office should a council
member violate the § 3-3 residency requirement and that such
forfeiture automatically results in an immediate vacancy of that
office; 2) impeachment under § 13-13 of the CCM and recall under
§ 12-1, et seq. of the CCM are not remedies for a violation of
§ 3-3, as those provisions cannot effect the immediacy and
vacancy requirements of § 3-3; 3) declaratory judgment may be a
possible remedy for a violation of § 3-3, as well as quo
warranto; 4) Plaintiffs-Appellants Alberta S. Dejetley; John R.
Dela Cruz; Deborah Yooko Dela Cruz; Laurie Ann Delima; Roy Y.H.

Eligado; Lawrence G. Endrina; Darlene Janice Endrina; Reynold
Masaji Gima; Bruce Harvey; Jennifer Philomena Lichter; Ron
McComber; Phyllis S. McComber; Sherri Mora; John W. Ornellas;
Gail Riener French; Neal S. Tamashiro; Tom Urpanil, Jr.; and
Beverly Zigmond [collectively, “Plaintiffs”] should be freely
given leave to amend their complaint to specify quo warranto
relief; and 5) it would be premature for this court to decide
whether in this case quo warranto necessarily precludes an action
for declaratory judgment, as an action for quo warranto is not
before this court.  Inasmuch as the circuit court of the second
circuit (the court)1 held to the contrary as to the aforesaid
matters (1), (2), (3) and (4), the court’s March 19, 2009 Order ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
3Granting the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (March 19
Order) filed by Defendant-Appellant Solomon P. Kaho #ohalahala
(Kaho#ohalahala) and the court’s May 7, 2009 Order Denying
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Relief From Order or Judgment or, in the
Alternative, for Leave to Amend (May 7 Order), are reversed, and
the June 23, 2009 Judgment of the court (Judgment) is hereby
vacated, and the case is remanded for further disposition
consistent with this opinion.
I.
Plaintiffs are a coalition of Lana #i residents and
voters who sought a declaratory judgment that Kaho #ohalahala, the
Maui County Council representative for Lana# i, was not a resident
of Lana#i, had therefore immediately forfeited his office, and
that the Lana# i council seat was vacant.  On November 4, 2008,
Kaho#ohalahala was elected to the Lana# i seat on the Maui County
Council.  On November 24, 2008, a complaint was filed against
Kaho#ohalahala and also against Roy Hiraga in his official
capacity as the County Clerk of the County of Maui and Kevin
Cronin in his official capacity as the Chief Election Officer of
the State of Hawai #i.  On January 9, 2009, Kaho# ohalahala moved to
dismiss the original complaint on grounds that the court had no
jurisdiction because the complaint constituted an unlawful appeal
from administrative hearings held before the complaint was filed. 
On January 29, 2009, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended
Complaint for declaratory judgment and injunction against***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
On October 20, 2009, this court issued its opinion affirming the2
November 1, 2008 decision of the Board of Registration for Maui County (Board)
which determined that Kaho# ohalahala was not a resident of Lana# i for voter
registration “purposes of [the November 2008] election[.]”  Dupree v. Hiraga,
121 Hawai# i 297, 299, 219 P.3d 1084, 1086 (2009).
4Kaho#ohalahala requesting that the court find Kaho #ohalahala was
not a resident ofLana’i and that he must immediately forfeit his
office.  Defendants Hiraga and Cronin were removed from the
lawsuit on March 4, 2009.  The original complaint contained
additional allegations that were not included in the First
Amended Complaint to the effect that 1) Kaho #ohalahala was not a
registered voter and that 2) the filing of his nomination papers
based upon such false basis constituted fraud on the County and
other registered voters.2  
On February 6, 2009, the court heard the motion to
dismiss.  On March 4, 2009, the court issued its order denying
the motion to dismiss, concluding that many of the arguments in
the motion were addressed to the original complaint and that
Plaintiffs were no longer contesting Kaho #ohalahala’s eligibility
to run for office or the election results.  The parties disagreed
as to whether the court rendered a decision as to its subject
matter jurisdiction at that point.  
However, the First Amended Complaint prayed for “a
declaratory judgment that . . . Mr. Kahoohalahala must
immediately forfeit the office ofLana’i council member” and an
injunction to “[e]njoin Mr. Kahoohalahala from . . hold[ing] ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
HRS § 603-2 (1993) states that “[t]here shall be established in3
each of the judicial circuits of the State a court with the powers and under
the conditions hereinafter set forth, which shall be styled the circuit court
of such circuit, as, for instance, the circuit court of the third circuit.”
HRS § 603-21.5(a) (Supp. 2008) states in part:
The several circuit courts shall have jurisdiction,
except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, of: 
. . . .
(2) Actions for penalties and forfeitures incurred under
the laws of the State;
(3) Civil actions and proceedings, in addition to
those listed in sections 603-21.6, 603-21.7, and
603-21.8; and
(4) Actions for impeachment of county officers who
are subject to impeachment.
(Emphases added.)
HRS § 603-21.7 (1993) states in part:
The several circuit courts shall have jurisdiction,
without the intervention of a jury except as provided by
statute, as follows:
. . . .
(b)  Of actions or proceedings in or in the nature of
habeas corpus, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and all
other proceedings in or in the nature of applications for
writs directed to courts of inferior jurisdiction, to
corporations and individuals, as may be necessary to the
furtherance of justice and the regular execution of the law.
(Emphasis added.)
HRS § 632-1 (1993) states in part:
 
In cases of actual controversy, courts of record,
within the scope of their respective jurisdictions, shall
have power to make binding adjudications of right, whether
or not consequential relief is, or at the time could be,
claimed . . . .
Relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in civil
cases where an actual controversy exists between contending
parties, . . . and the court is satisfied also that a
declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty
or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.  Where,
however, a statute provides a special form of remedy for a
specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be
followed; but the mere fact that an actual or threatened
controversy is susceptible of relief through a general
common law remedy, a remedy equitable in nature, or an

matter jurisdiction was alleged “pursuant to [Hawai# i Revised
Statutes (HRS)] §§ 603-2, 603-21.5, 603-21.7 and 632-1.”3  On***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)3
extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is
recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debar a
party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment
in any case where the other essentials to such relief are
present.
(Emphases added.)
 There is a disagreement by the parties as to whether4
Kaho#ohalahala timely argued that impeachment under § 13-13 of the CCM was an
acceptable means of removal.  Plaintiffs contend that Kaho# ohalahala first
raised this argument in his reply memorandum and that the court improperly
considered this argument.  Kaho# ohalahala contends that the impeachment
provision was attached to his motion and this appears correct.
CCM § 3-3 (2003) states as follows:5
Section 3-3. Qualifications.  To be eligible for election or
appointment to the council, a person must be a citizen of
the United States, a voter in the county, a resident of the
county for a period of ninety (90) days next preceding the
filing of nomination papers and at the time of filing of
nomination papers a resident in the area from which the
person seeks to be elected.  If a council member ceases to
be a resident of the county, or ceases to be a resident of
the council member's residency area during the council
member's term of office, or if a council member is
adjudicated guilty of a felony, the council member shall

6their faces the statutes afforded the court subject matter
jurisdiction over the First Amended Complaint.  
On February 17, 2009, Kaho #ohalahala filed a motion for
judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that 1) Plaintiffs could
not use declarative and injunctive remedies to evade the express
removal procedures provided by the CCM4 and 2) judicial review of
a council member’s qualifications was an infringement upon the
Maui County Council’s legislative authority.  The court issued
its March 19 order granting Kaho #ohalahala’s motion for judgment
on the pleadings, finding 1) that if Kaho# ohalahala is not a
resident of Lana# i, under § 3-35 of the CCM he is under a duty to***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

immediately forfeit office and the seat shall thereupon
become vacant. (Amended 1992) 
(Emphases added.)  available at http://www.co.maui.hi.us/index.aspx?nid=162 
CCM § 13-13 states as follows: 6
Section 13-13. Impeachment of officers. Appointed or elected
officers may be impeached for malfeasance, misfeasance or
nonfeasance in office or violation of the provisions of
Article 10.  Such impeachment proceedings shall be commenced
in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, State of
Hawai#i.  The charge or charges shall be set forth in
writing in a verified petition for impeachment signed by not
less than five percent (5%) of the voters registered in the
last general election.  A charge or charges alleging
violation of Article 10 may be set forth in writing in a
verified petition for impeachment signed by a majority of
the members of the board of ethics.  If the court sustains
the charge or charges, such officer shall be deemed removed
from office.  The officer sought to be impeached and the
petitioners seeking the impeachment other than the board of
ethics shall bear their own attorney's fees and other costs
of such proceedings. 
(Emphases added.)
The court specifically stated that impeachment governs nonfeasance7
in its order and that impeachment was not the only remedy.  The recall
provision is referred to in a footnote to the latter statement.  CCM § 12-1
states as follows: 
Section 12-1. Recall Procedure.  Any elective officer or
member of a board or commission provided for in this charter
may be removed from office by the voters of the county.  The
procedure to effect such removal shall be in accordance with
this Article. 
7immediately forfeit his office, 2) that failure to forfeit would
constitute nonfeasance, 3) that § 13-136 (impeachment of an
officer) and § 12-17 (recall election procedures) of the CCM
govern removal for nonfeasance, 4) that Plaintiffs did not
constitute five percent (5%) of the voters of the last general
election as required for impeachment under § 13-13 of the CCM,
and 5) also that there was no verified petition for impeachment
before the court, as required under § 13-13 of the CCM, and
consequently, the matter must be dismissed.  The court noted that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
This case is before us by virtue of our acceptance of a request8
filed by Plaintiffs for transfer from the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA),
pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.2 (2009) and
HRS § 602-58 (Supp. 2008).  HRS § 602-58 entitled “Application for transfer to
the supreme court,” states in part as follows:
(a) The supreme court, in the manner and within the
time provided by the rules of court, shall grant an
application to transfer any case within the jurisdiction of
the [ICA] to the supreme court upon the grounds that the
case involves:
(1) A question of imperative or fundamental public
importance;
. . . .
b) The supreme court, in a manner and within the time
provided by the rules of court, may grant an application to
transfer any case within the jurisdiction of the [ICA] to
the supreme court upon the grounds that the case involves:
(1) A question of first impression or a novel legal
question; or

d...)
8the order “provides only that declaratory relief is not an
appropriate means of removing an elected official from office”
but that impeachment was not the only means of removal. 
On March 30, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a motion for relief
from the March 19 Order pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Civil
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b), or in the alternative for leave to
amend their First Amended Complaint to “specifically mention quo
warranto by name” pursuant to HRCP Rule 15(a).  Kaho #ohalahala
opposed the motion on grounds that a second amendment would be
unduly prejudicial.  In its May 7, 2009 order, the court denied
Plaintiffs’ motion.   
The court entered judgment in favor of Kaho #ohalahala
on June 23, 2009.  Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal on
July 6, 2009, appealing the Judgment and the March 19 Order. 
Transfer to this court was granted on October 9, 2009.8  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

(2) Issues upon which there is an inconsistency in
the decisions of the [ICA] or of the supreme
court.
9II.
Plaintiffs raise two questions on appeal.  The first
asks 
whether under [HRS] § 632-1 (1993), a circuit court may
declare a forfeiture has occurred and the council seat is
vacant upon a determination a council member is not a
resident of his residency area, or whether the Charter means
only that a council member is subject to an impeachment
proceeding for “nonfeasance” after a council member refuses
to resign, or a recall election after he is in office for at
least six months.
 
Plaintiffs’ second question on appeal asks “whether [the court]
abused its discretion when it did not ‘freely give’ leave to
amend the form of the complaint to label the relief sought as a
writ of quo warranto.” 
III.
Plaintiffs request that the Judgment be vacated and
this case be remanded to the court for further proceedings.
IV.
A.
As to Plaintiffs’ first question on appeal, Plaintiffs
initially maintain that the plain text of CCM § 3-3 “created its
own self-executing remedy for council members . . . who cease to
be residents of their residency areas” and requires “immediate”
forfeiture and vacancy.  In support this proposition, Plaintiffs
cite to cases from this and other jurisdictions, including In re
Pioneer Mill Co., 53 Haw. 496, 505, 497 P.2d 549, 555 (1972) ***FOR PUBLI CATION IN WEST S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

10See supra note 3.
10(holding that the land court s judgment was rendered void on the
basis that the land court judge had automatically forfeited his
office when he announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor);
Pombo v. Fleming , 32 Haw. 818, 820 (Haw. Terr. 1933) (county
supervisor who took another position in effect  expressly
resigned ); Hollinger v. Kumalae, 25 Haw. 669, 689 (Haw. Terr.
1920) (acceptance of office of supervisor automatically vacated
the offices of state senator and state representative); Lipscomb
v. Randall , 985 S.W.2d 601, 608 (Tex. Ct. App. 1999) (holding
that the Flower Mound Town Charter s forfeiture provision for
conviction of a crime was self-enacting and automatic regarding a
councilman s conviction for assault); In re Simmons , 395 P.2d
1013 (Wash. 1964) (citing State ex rel. Carroll v. Simmons , 377
P.2d 421 (Wash. 1962)) (stating that a judge s felony conviction
carried with it automatic forfeiture of the judgeship and created
an immediate vacancy; legal proceedings to remove the official
were merely ancillary to and in aid of the forfeiture and not a
condition precedent to the forfeiture). 
Plaintiffs next contend that declaratory relief is
available and that the circuit courts have jurisdiction to
declare a forfeiture and vacancy pursuant to HRS §§ 603-
21.5(a)(2)   9  and 632-1.   10 (Citing Hawaii s Thousand Friends v. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
11City & County of Honolulu, 75 Haw. 237, 245, 858 P.2d 726, 731
(1993) (holding that similar language in the Coastal Zone
Management Act (CZMA), HRS § 205A-6(e) (1985), “clearly allowed”
a plaintiff to elect whether to seek relief under the CZMA or by
“generic declaratory judgment”).  They further assert that the
circuit courts must have jurisdiction because the Maui County
Council lacks the power to enforce the continuous residency
requirement, citing, in contrast, statutes from other
jurisdictions and offices where the legislative body was granted
authority to manage its own members’ qualifications.  
Plaintiffs additionally argue that the court
“effectively rewrote the [CCM] by ignoring the terms ‘shall,’
‘immediate,’ ‘forfeit,’ and ‘vacancy,’ transforming a mandatory,
self-executing, and immediate forfeiture and vacancy in § 3-3
into a nonimmediate, discretionary process” by its March 19
Order.  (Citing Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals, County of Hawai# i, 109
Hawai#i 384, 393, 126 P.3d 1071, 1080 (2006) (noting that the use
of the term “shall” indicates mandatory language); In re Doe, 108
Hawai#i 144, 153, 118 P.3d 54, 63 (2005) (“Because that statute
states that the court ‘may’ appoint a guardian, discretion
resided in the court as to whether to do so or not.”); Coon v.
City & County of Honolulu, 98 Hawai #i 233, 250, 47 P.3d 348, 365
(2002) (stating that the rules of statutory construction require
rejection of interpretation of a statute that renders any part of
the statutory language a nullity); Pioneer Mill, 53 Haw. at 500,***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Plaintiffs argue that although the “court only expressly11
eliminated declaratory judgment, it also rejected quo warranto as reflected by
its refusal to allow amendment of the complaint to specify that the relief
sought is in the form of quo warranto.” 
Kaho#ohalahala does not address Plaintiffs’ argument that § 3-3 of12
the CCM requires immediate and mandatory forfeiture or that such forfeiture
automatically creates a vacancy.
12497 P.2d at 552 (holding that the failure to effectuate the plain
meaning of the forfeiture provision would “rewrite the
Constitution”).  Plaintiffs declare that the court effectively
nullified the mandatory “immediate forfeiture” and vacancy
requirements of § 3-3 of the CCM when it concluded that judicial
remedies of declaratory judgment and quo warranto11 were not
available and in further concluding that discretionary remedies
of impeachment under § 13-13 of the CCM or recall under § 12-1 of
the CCM were available instead. 
B.
Kaho#ohalahala responds to Plaintiffs’ first and third12
sub-arguments that § 3-3 of the CCM’s plain language imposes a
duty on the council member to forfeit his office, by contending
that in Pioneer Mill the statute was structured so that the
judge’s announcement of candidacy was also the act of forfeiture,
but that in CCM § 3-3 forfeiture is not automatic because the act
of forfeiture must be triggered upon the occurrence of certain
events, i.e., conviction of a felony or loss of residency. 
Additionally, Kaho #ohalahala objects to Plaintiffs’ reliance on
foreign jurisdictions arguing, instead, that the cannons of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
13statutory construction govern and that the language in § 3-3 of
the CCM is clear and unambiguous.  (Citing County of Hawai# i v.
C&J Coupe Family Ltd. P’ship, 119 Hawai #i 352, 363, 198 P.3d 615,
626 (2008) (stating that, “where the language of the law in
question is plain and unambiguous[,] courts must give effect to
the law according to its plain and obvious meaning” (quoting
Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto Ass’n, 108 Hawai# i 358, 360, 120
P.3d 257, 259 (2005))); Maui County Council v. Thompson, 84
Hawai#i 105, 106, 929 P.2d 1355, 1356 (1996) (when the charter is
plain and unambiguous, the court’s “only duty is to give effect
to its plain and obvious meaning” (quoting State v. Baron, 80
Hawai#i 107, 113, 905 P.2d 613, 619 (1995))); State v. Fagaragan,
115 Hawai #i 364, 369, 167 P.3d 739, 744 (App. 2007) (turning to
“structure” as well as plain language of statute in order to
interpret meaning).).
According to Kaho# ohalahala, the failure of a council
member to forfeit his or her office constitutes nonfeasance. 
(Citing Black’s Law Dictionary 729 (6th ed. 1991) (“As respects
to public officials, ‘nonfeasance’ is substantial failure to
perform a required legal duty.”); Lee v. Corregedore, 83 Hawai# i
154, 174 n.1, 925 P.2d 324, 344 n.1 (1996) (Levinson, J.,
dissenting) (“Nonfeasance implies the failure to act where a duty
to act existed.”); Baccus v. Ameripride Servs., Inc., 179 P.3d
309, 350 (Idaho 2008) (“‘Nonfeasance’ means the omission of an
act which a person ought to do.” (citation omitted)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Kaho#ohalahala does not directly counter Plaintiffs’ second sub-13
argument as to the court’s jurisdiction.  Kaho# ohalahala mentions subject
matter jurisdiction in his Statement of the Case in that, during the
February 6, 2009 hearing on Kaho #ohalahala’s Motion to Dismiss, the court did
not foreclose the possibility that a future subject matter jurisdiction
challenge could be made.  Kaho# ohalahala subsequently filed his motion for
judgment on the pleadings asserting that declaratory judgment was not an
available remedy for Plaintiffs, but challenge to the court’s jurisdiction
does not seem to have been mentioned again.
See HRS § 632-1, quoted supra, at note 3.14
14Kaho#ohalahala asserts that the appropriate remedies for
nonfeasance are found within CCM §§ 13-13 (impeachment), 12-1
(recall election), 12-1 et seq (removal proceedings), and 12-7
(an elected official can be recalled for any reason).  He argues
that “[t]he remedy provided by the impeachment proceedings –
removal from office based on non-residency - is identical to the
remedy sought by [Plaintiffs] in their amended complaint.” 
As to Plaintiffs’ second13 sub-argument regarding the
availability of declaratory relief, Kaho #ohalahala maintains that
Plaintiffs may not be granted declaratory relief when “a statute
provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case,”14
that removal of elected officials by the voters is a “special
form of remedy for a specific type of case,” and that under § 13-
13 of the CCM the voters are empowered “to bring impeachment
proceedings against elected officials who fail to perform their
duties.”  Kaho #ohalahala also notes that the CCM “provides voters
with recall and removal proceedings” as well, under § 12-1 et
seq., and that “[a]n elected official can be recalled for any
reason” under § 12-7.  Again, Kaho #ohalahala asserts that recall***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Recall proceedings detailed in sections 12-1 through 12-9 of the15
CCM essentially provide that the question of whether an elected officer should
be removed be brought to the voters through a special election, requiring a
petition signed by at least 20% of the voters in the last election and
occurring no sooner than six months after the elected official took office. 
Impeachment proceedings are to be commenced in the Second Circuit Court with
charges set forth in a verified petition, signed by at least 5% of the voters
in the last election.  There is no waiting period before impeachment
proceedings may be instituted. 
15and impeachment proceedings would seem to effect the same remedy,
i.e., removal of an elected official, but have different
procedural requirements.15  (Citing Kaleikau v. Hall, 27 Haw.
420, 424 (Haw. Terr. 1923) (holding that declaratory relief
cannot replace already-existing procedures such as petitions for
quo warranto); Ex Parte James, 684 So. 2d 1315 (Ala. 1996) (“Quo

perceive as a clear quo warranto claim”); Cooper v. State, 818

remedy already exists”); Beasley v. City of E. Cleveland, 486

C.
In Plaintiffs’ reply to Kaho# ohalahala’s first and
third sub-argument response, Plaintiffs assert that § 3-3 of the
CCM does not impose a duty upon the council member to resign,
because the loss of office is an automatic and self-executing
provision requiring no action on Kaho# ohalahala’s part.  (Citing
Black’s Law Dictionary 548 (5th ed. 1979) (to “forfeit” means
“[t]o lose, or lose the right to, by some error, fault, offense

17position that § 3-3 of the CCM is automatic and self-executing,
reciting support used in their opening brief.
In reply to Kaho #ohalahala’s second sub-argument
response, Plaintiffs assert that declaratory relief is available
because there is no other “special remedy” provided by the
Charter or another statute that would bar Plaintiffs from
obtaining declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1.  (Citing HRS
§ 632-1 (“the mere fact that an actual or threatened controversy
is susceptible of relief through a general common law remedy
. . . shall not debar a party from the privilege of obtaining a
declaratory judgment”); Punohu v. Sunn, 66 Haw. 485, 487, 666
P.2d 1133, 1135 (1983) (holding that declaratory judgment was not
available because a special remedy existed under HRS ch. 91 for
administrative appeals); Costa v. Sunn, 64 Haw. 389, 389, 642
P.2d 530, 531 (1983) (holding that administrative procedures act
expressly authorized declaratory relief); Traveler’s Ins. Co. v.
Hawaii Roofing, Inc., 64 Haw. 380, 386, 641 P.2d 1333, 1137
(1982) (holding that declaratory judgment was not available
because a special remedy existed through worker’s compensation
statutes)).  Plaintiffs restate their support from Hawaii’s
Thousand Friends, 75 Hawai #i at 245, 858 P.2d at 731, which
stated that the CZMA section providing that “[n]othing in this
section shall restrict any right that any person may have to
assert any other claim or bring any other action” “clearly ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Plaintiffs argue also that Kaho# ohalahala did not properly raise16
the claim that quo warranto was a “special remedy” in the proceedings below
and that, as such, this argument should be precluded.  (Citing Hill v. Inouye,
90 Hawai# i 76, 82, 976 P.2d 390, 396 (1998) (appellate courts “will not
consider an issue not raised below unless justice so requires” (quoting State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Dacanay, 87 Hawai# i 136, 145 n.14, 952 P.2d 893,

amend to “specify” quo warranto in its First Amended Complaint that was filed
in the court.
18allowed” a person to “bring a generic declaratory action under
HRS § 632-1 without the need to proceed under” the CZMA.
According to Plaintiffs, quo warranto is not a “special
remedy”16 to be used to the exclusion of declaratory relief. 
(Citing HRS § 659-10 (1993) (“Nothing in this chapter shall
preclude the obtaining of relief available by quo warranto by
other appropriate action”); Office of Hawaiian Affairs v.
Cayetano, 94 Hawai# i 1, 8, 6 P.3d 799, 806 (2000) (holding that
quo warranto needed to create vacancy because U.S. Supreme Court
decision, unlike the Charter, did not automatically create one)). 
They further state that Kaho# ohalahala’s reliance on cases from
other jurisdictions is misplaced because those jurisdictions do
not contain a non-exclusivity provision similar to that in HRS §
659-10.  Plaintiffs additionally assert that because § 3-3 of the
CCM creates a vacancy in office upon forfeiture, a writ is not
necessary to do so.  (Citing Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 94
Hawai#i at 8, 6 P.3d at 806 (stating that when a court decision
or a statute does not automatically create a vacancy in office,
quo warranto is available to do so)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
HRS § 659-1 (1993) states: 17
Definition.  This is an order issuing in the name of
the State by a circuit court and directed to a person who
claims or usurps an office of the State or of any
subdivision thereof, or of any corporation or quasi-
corporation, public or private, or any franchise, inquiring
by what authority the person claims the office or franchise.
(Emphases added.)
HRS § 659-10 entitled “Other actions,” states that “[n]othing in18
this chapter shall preclude the obtaining of relief available by quo warranto
by other appropriate action.”  (Emphasis added.)
19V.
A.
As to Plaintiffs’ second question on appeal, Plaintiffs
first maintain that the remedy of a writ of quo warranto pursuant
to HRS §§ 659-117 and 659-1018 is available, and that the court
has jurisdiction to issue a writ of quo warranto pursuant to HRS
§ 603-21.7.  (Citing Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 94 Hawai# i at 8-
9, 6 P.3d at 806-07 (stating that the writ is available to create
vacancy in office where statute does not do so automatically)). 
Plaintiffs next assert that the remedy of quo warranto
is substantively the same as a declaratory judgment.  They argue
that declaratory relief is not limited in scope, similar to quo
warranto, and that the court would have to determine whether
Kaho#ohalahala was a resident ofLana’i under either action. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs cite to a number of state and federal
cases to support their contention that the First Amended
Complaint need only give Kaho #ohalahala clear notice under HRCP***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief cites to Henderson v. Professional19
Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387, 395, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991) (“Pleadings should
not be construed technically when determining what the pleader is attempting
to set forth but should be construed liberally so as to do substantial
justice.”); Perry v. Planning Comm’n, 62 Haw. 666, 685, 619 P.2d 95, 108
(1980) (“Modern judicial pleading has been characterized as ‘simplified notice
pleading.’  Its function is to give opposing parties ‘fair notice of what the
. . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,’”  (Quoting Conley v.
Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957).)); Hall v. Kim, 53 Haw. 215, 224, 491 P.2d
541, 547 (1971) (“[B]y the adoption of [the HRCP,] we have rejected the
approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may
be decisive to the outcome and in turn accepted the principle that the purpose
of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.”  (Internal
quotation marks and citation omitted.)).
The court declared that in its discretion and based upon its prior20
order (presumably the March 19 Order Granting the Motion for Judgment on the
(continued...)
20Rule 8, and that the substance of the claim, not form, matters.19 
Also, Plaintiffs urge that they should have been
“freely given” leave to amend their complaint.  (Citing Hirasa v.
Burtner, 68 Haw. 22, 26, 702 P.2d 772, 775 (1985) (stating that,
“[i]n the absence of any apparent or declared reason” “such as
undue delay[ and] bad faith . . . on the part of the movant,
repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously
allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of
allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. . . . the
leave should, as the rules require, be ‘freely given’” (quoting
Bishop Trust Co. v. Kamokila Dev. Corp., 57 Haw. 330, 337, 555
P.2d 1193, 1198 (1976) (other citation omitted)) (emphases
added))); HRCP Rule 15(a) (stating that “leave shall be freely
given when justice so requires”). 
Plaintiffs maintain that the court did not articulate a
reason for the denial to amend, which alone is an abuse of
discretion.20  They further assert that in addition to the***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)20
Pleadings), it deemed denying the motion to amend to be the appropriate
decision.  The court stated: 
The [c]ourt concludes that for purposes of the motion for
relief that the record supports denial of that motion.  I’m
going to therefore deny that motion.  And with respect to
the motion to amend, for leave to amend, after the [c]ourt’s
earlier order, in the [c]ourt’s view, given the [c]ourt’s
previous ruling, given the current status of this case and
the history of these proceedings, the proper exercise at the
[c]ourt’s discretion relative to the request for leave to
amend is to deny that motion as well. 
Kaho#ohalahala also argues that Plaintiffs failed to properly21
include any argument underlying their second point of error in their Opening
Brief and therefor pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(7), which states that “[p]oints
not argued may be deemed waived,” the argument should be waived.  This seems
incorrect as Plaintiffs did argue that the May 7 Order, denying their motion
to amend, was an abuse of discretion by the court because they should have
been “freely given” leave to amend their complaint, although not explicitly
headlined as their second point of error.  It may be noted that, in their
Opening Brief, Plaintiffs failed to support their argument that the court’s
failure to articulate a reason constituted an abuse of discretion.  However,
Plaintiffs do cite to case law supporting that proposition in their Reply
Brief.  (Citing Keawe v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., 65 Haw. 232, 239, 649 P.2d 1149,
1154 (1982) (stating that failure to articulate any reason for the denial is
(continued...)
21absence of declared reasons, there was no apparent basis for
denying the motion to amend.  Plaintiffs argue there was no undue
delay.  According to Plaintiffs, there was also no improper
purpose and no pattern of “repeated failure to cure deficiencies
by amendments previously allowed” anywhere in the record.  Next,
Plaintiffs contend that Kaho# ohalahala would not suffer prejudice
because the complaint would only be changed in form, not
substance, and the motion to amend was requested in the early
pleading stage.  Lastly, Plaintiffs assert that the amendment
would not be futile.
B.
Kaho#ohalahala responds to Plaintiffs’ second question
on appeal,21 asserting that the court’s reason in denying the***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)21
alone an abuse of discretion.)  
Kaho#ohalahala cites to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. v.22
Transamerica Insurance Co., 89 Hawai# i 157, 162 n.1, 969 P.2d 1275, 1280 n.1
(1998), for the proposition that “Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure is functionally identical to Rule 15(a) HRCP” and that “[w]here a
Hawai#i rule of civil procedure is identical to the federal rule, the
interpretation of this rule by the federal courts is highly persuasive.” 
(Quoting Wong v. Takeuchi, 87 Hawai# i 320, 329, 955 P.2d 593, 602 (1998).).  
22motion to amend the complaint was because Kaho #ohalahala would
suffer undue prejudice if Plaintiffs were allowed to amend their
complaint.  (Citing Mayeaux v. Lousiana Health Serv. & Indem.
Co., 376 F.3d 420, 426-27 (5th Cir. 2004)22 (stating that court’s
failure to state reason for denial of leave to amend complaint
“is unfortunate but not fatal in affirmance” when the record
shows “ample and obvious grounds”) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted)).
According to Kaho# ohalahala, allowing Plaintiffs to
amend their complaint from a declaratory action to one for quo
warranto would have been unfairly prejudicial because a new quo
warranto action would have changed the lawsuit against
Kaho#ohalahala from one against him in his personal capacity to
one against him in his official capacity.  Kaho# ohalahala
maintains that, although Corporation Counsel had a duty to
represent him, Corporation Counsel had refused to represent
Kaho#ohalahala.  Kaho# ohalahala asserts that thus, if the
amendment were granted, he would have to resort to privately-
retained counsel, incurring personal costs and expenses.  (Citing***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
CCM § 8-2.3(2) states in part: 23
Section 8-2.3. Powers, Duties, and Functions.  The corporation
counsel shall: 
. . . .
2. Be the chief legal advisor and legal representative of the
County of
 Maui; of the council, the mayor, all departments,
and all boards and commissions; and of all officers and
employees in matters relating to their official duties. 
Kaho#ohalahala also cites to numerous cases in which the24
government attorney defended a public official.  See In re Application of
Ferguson, 74 Haw. 394, 846 P.2d 894 (1993) (Attorney General defended district
court judge); In re Application of Thomas, 73 Haw. 223, 832 P.2d 253 (1992)
(corporation counsel defended deputies corporation counsel); Okuda v. Ching,
71 Haw. 140, 785 P.2d 943 (1990) (corporation counsel defended prosecuting
attorney); Crossley v. Ing, 50 Haw. 470, 442 P.2d 459 (1968) (Attorney General
defended lieutenant governor and governor); In re Sherretz, 40 Haw. 366 (Haw.
Terr. 1953) (county attorney defended city personnel director); In re Jones,
34 Haw. 12 (Haw. Terr. 1936) (Attorney General defended commissioner of
Territorial Board of Archives).  
23§ 8-2.3(2)23 of the CCM.24)  However, Kaho# ohalahala does not
explain why Corporation Counsel refused the tender of his
defense.  He refers to the record, but the record does not
explain Corporation Counsel’s refusal.
C.
In Plaintiffs’ reply to Kaho# ohalahala’s response to
the second question on appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the court
did not deny the motion to amend because of undue prejudice to
Kaho#ohalahala.  Plaintiffs note that Kaho# ohalahala fails to
provide a cite to the record for where the court stated that
allowing the amended complaint would prejudice Kaho# ohalahala. 
They maintain that nothing in the record indicates whether the
court agreed or did not agree with Kaho #ohalahala’s objection on
prejudicial grounds.***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
  See supra note 17.25
24Further, Plaintiffs reply that the basis of their
complaint, i.e., that Kaho #ohalahala was not a resident ofLana’i
and had therefore forfeited his council seat, is the same whether
the relief requested is declaratory or is in the form of a writ
of quo warranto.  Next, Plaintiffs contend that Kaho #ohalahala’s
assertion of prejudice because of “additional discovery, costs,
and expenses” is incorrect because the case has not progressed
beyond the pleading stages in the court yet and there is thus no
evidence that he would incur any “additional expense.”  Finally,
Plaintiffs respond that it makes no difference that Corporation
Counsel refused the tender of defense for Kaho# ohalahala. 
According to Plaintiffs, Kaho #ohalahala would have to retain
private counsel inasmuch as, “in a quo warranto case, the
plaintiffs would be seeking a writ on behalf of the people and in
the public interest.”  (Citing HRS § 659-125) (stating that quo
warranto “is an order issuing in the name of the State by a
circuit court”).
VI.
The first question raised on appeal implicates two
issues.  The first issue is whether § 3-3 of the CCM is a
mandatory, immediate forfeiture provision that is triggered when
a council member fails to be a resident of his or her county, or
whether it, instead, works in tandem with other provisions of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
See § 3-3 of the CCM quoted supra, at note 5, specifically the26
last sentence of the provision at issue, which states that “[i]f a council
member ceases to be a resident of the county, or ceases to be a resident of
the council member’s residency area during the council member’s term of
office, . . . the council member shall immediately forfeit office and the seat
shall thereupon become vacant.”  (Emphases added.)
25CCM, specifically impeachment under § 13-13 or recall under § 12-
1 to effect removal from office.  The second issue is whether
declaratory action is an available method of relief under CCM
§ 3-3.
A.
This court’s statutory construction is guided by
established rules:
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists.
Rees v. Carlisle, 113 Hawai# i 446, 452, 153 P.3d 1131, 1137
(2007).  “The interpretation of the charter is similar to the
interpretation of a statute.”  Thompson, 84 Hawai #i at 106, 929
P.2d at 1356.
Kaho#ohalahala and the court below maintained that CCM
§ 3-326 places a duty upon the council member to resign his
position and that failure to do so constitutes nonfeasance.  
This proposition would seem to be supported by the words, “the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
See Haw. Const. art. V, § 3.  This provision was later eliminated27
when article V was amended and redesignated as article VI.  But, at the time
of the Pioneer Mill case, it was in effect.
In Pioneer Mill, only the rulings made by the judge after his28
announcement were voided because it was determined that the judge forfeited
his office when he made the announcement.  This was not an action to
specifically remove the judge, however.  Kaho# ohalahala argues that the case
only holds that the judge’s rulings were void, but that the judge was not
specifically removed.  Plaintiffs counter in their reply that Kaho
#ohalahala
(c
ontinued...)
26council member shall . . . ” (emphasis added), implying that a
duty is imposed on the council member.  
However, the plain meaning of “forfeit” necessitates a
different interpretation of the provision.  “Forfeiture” means
“loss of a right, privilege, or property because of a crime,
breach of obligation, or neglect of duty.”  Black’s Law
Dictionary 722 (9th ed. 2009).  The last sentence of § 3-3 of the
CCM states in part, “the council member shall immediately forfeit
office.”  Thus, the correct construction of the provision would
be that “the council member shall immediately” lose his right or
privilege of “office.”  Here, there cannot be a duty to lose
one’s office, instead the office is automatically lost.  
In Pioneer Mill, this court held that a prior provision
in the Hawai# i Constitution that “[a]ny justice or judge who
shall become a candidate for an elective office shall thereby
forfeit his office,”27 meant that the land court judge forfeited
his judgeship upon announcement of his candidacy for political
office.  53 Haw. at 498, 497 P.2d at 551.  The forfeiture in that
case was triggered by the judge’s announcement of his
candidacy.28  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)28
misstated the court’s conclusion in Pioneer Mill, in that not only was the
judgment rendered void, but that this court held the judge had lost his office
by virtue of his becoming a candidate. 
The opinion states, “We have concluded that the [l]and [c]ourt
judge had become a candidate for public office at the time he rendered the
decision below, and that under the Hawaii Constitution, he had forfeited his
judgeship.”  Pioneer Mill, 53 Haw. at 498, 497 P.2d at 551.  It appears that
this court did rule that the judge had forfeited his position, but no action
was taken to effect the forfeiture because the judge had already stepped down
to run for political office a little more than a month after his announcement
of candidacy.  Id at 506, 497 P.2d at 556. 
27However, Kaho# ohalahala argues that the language in
§ 3-3 of the CCM is different from that in Pioneer Mill, because
§ 3-3 requires an “event” such as lack of residency or conviction
of a felony to precipitate the forfeiture, rather than an “act”
on the part of the officer.  Kaho# ohalahala, however, does not
cite any support for the proposition that an event triggers the
provision, but an act does not.  This distinction seems to be
without basis, as in either case the provision would be
effectuated and the officer would thus forfeit his or her
position.
Additionally, the words preceding “forfeit,” i.e.,
“shall” and “immediately,” lend credence to the mandatory and
automatic nature of § 3-3.  “Shall” “is the mandatory sense that
drafters typically intend and that courts typically uphold.” 
Black’s Law Dictionary at 1499.  This court has held that “shall”
indicates mandatory language.  Leslie, 109 Hawai# i at 393, 126
P.3d at 1080 (stating that shall “is generally imperative or
mandatory” (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990)));
Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, State of Hawai# i, 84 Hawai# i***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
28138, 150, 931 P.2d 580, 592 (1997) (“The word ‘shall’ is
generally construed as mandatory in legal acceptation.”  (Quoting
In re Adoption of Watson, 45 Haw. 69, 79, 361 P.2d 1054, 1059
(1961).)).  “Immediate” means “[o]ccuring without delay;
instant.”  Black’s Law Dictionary at 816.  Thus, the phrase
“shall immediately forfeit office” in § 3-3 of the CCM, by its
plain meaning indicates a mandatory, instant, loss of office. 
Kaho#ohalahala and the court maintain that there was a duty on
the part of the council member to leave his office.  However,
given the plain meaning of “shall immediately forfeit office,” a
duty is not imposed to leave office but, rather, the right of
office is automatically and instantly lost. 
The remaining portion of CCM § 3-3 supports this
interpretation.  The following words “and the seat shall
thereupon become vacant” (emphasis added), confirms the
conclusion that the office is “immediately” lost and at that
instant, becomes vacant.  “‘Courts are bound to give effect to
all parts of a statute, and . . . no clause, sentence, or word
shall be construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if a
construction can be legitimately found which will give force to
and preserve all words of the statute.’”  Blair v. Harris, 98
Hawai#i 176, 179, 45 P.3d 798, 801 (2002) (quoting Keliipuleole
v. Wilson, 85 Hawai #i 217, 221, 941 P.2d 300, 304 (1997) (other
citations omitted)).  Thus, in order to give meaning to all
portions of § 3-3, § 3-3 must be construed as meaning that upon***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
§ 3-1 of the CCM states in part, as follows: 29
Section 3-1. Composition.  There shall be a council composed
of nine members who shall be elected-at large.  Of the nine
members elected to the council, one shall be a resident of
the Island ofLana’i, one a resident of the Island of
Moloka
#i, one a resident of the residency area of East Maui,
one a resident of the residency area of West Maui, one a
resident of the residency area of Makawao-Ha# iku-Pa#ia, one a
resident of the residency area of "Upcountry" comprising
Pukalani-Kula-
#Ulupalakua, one a resident of the residency
area of South Maui, one a resident of the residency area of
Kahului, and one a resident of the residency area of
Wailuku-Waihe# e-Waikapu.  The county clerk shall prepare the
nomination papers in such a manner that candidates desiring
to file for the office of council member shall specify the
residency area from which they are seeking a seat.  The
ballots shall, nevertheless, be prepared to give every voter
in the county the right to vote for each and every council
seat.
29loss of residency, a council member both loses his or her
position, and his or her seat becomes vacant. 
Furthermore, in construing § 3-3 of the CCM, this
court’s rules of statutory construction should also give effect
to legislative intent.  State v. Wells, 78 Hawai# i 373, 376, 894
P.2d 70, 73 (1995) (stating that “our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature”
(quoting Pac. Int'l Servs. Corp. v. Hurip, 76 Hawai #i 209, 216,
873 P.2d 88, 95 (1994))).  Under CCM § 3-1, the drafters of the
charter intended that the Maui County Council consist of nine
members and that, “one shall be a resident of the Island
ofLana’i.”29  Hence, § 3-1 mandates that one member of the
council be a resident ofLana’i.  Section 3-3 of the CCM enforces
the intention of the drafters, by rendering any council member’s
seat vacant upon the loss of residency. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
30There is nothing in CCM § 3-3 to suggest how the
removal from office should be enforced.  But, CCM § 3-3 cannot be
implemented through other removal provisions of the CCM without
losing its mandatory and immediate effect.  Potter v. Hawaii
Newspaper Agency, 89 Hawai #i 411, 422, 974 P.2d 51, 62-63 (1999)
(“Our rules of statutory construction require us to reject an
interpretation of [a] statute that renders any part of the
statutory language a nullity.”); see also State v. Jumila, 87
Hawai#i 1, 10, 950 P.2d 1201, 1210 (1998); Shultz v. Lujan, 86
Hawai#i 137, 141, 948 P.2d 558, 562 (1997); Konno v. County of
Hawai#i, 85 Hawai# i 61, 71, 937 P.2d 397, 401 (1997).  Although
Kaho#ohalahala and the court believed that impeachment under
§ 13-13 is a remedy for violation of § 3-3, impeachment is not
“immediate” as directed by the language, “shall immediately
forfeit,” nor does impeachment comport with the mandatory vacancy
language in § 3-3 of “shall thereupon become vacant,” inasmuch as
impeachment is a discretionary measure.  Under § 13-13 of the
CCM, impeachment procedures require a verified petition “signed
by not less than five percent (5%) of the voters registered in
the last general election.”  Gathering five percent of Maui
County’s voters alone would not fit within the immediacy language
of § 3-3, in addition to the time it would take for the second
circuit court to set and hold impeachment proceedings.  Moreover,
a voter’s decision to sign the verified petition for impeachment
is by itself a discretionary and not a mandatory act by a voter. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
See specifically CCM § 12-1 supra, at note 7, regarding the30
general provision of removal.
CCM § 12-6 states:31
Section 12-6. Recall Election.  If a recall petition or
supplemental petition shall be certified by the county clerk
to be sufficient, the county clerk shall at once submit the
petition with the certificate to the council and shall
notify the officer sought to be recalled of such action.  If
the officer whose removal is sought does not resign within
five (5) days after such notice, the council shall thereupon
order and fix a day for holding a recall election.  Any such
election shall be held not less than sixty (60) nor more
than ninety (90) days after the petition has been presented
to the council, at the same time as any other election held
within such period; but if no election is to be held within
(continued...)
31Impeachment under § 13-13 is also discretionary in that, “[i]f
the court sustains the charge or charges, such officer shall be
deemed removed from office.”  The use of “if” in this sentence
suggests that a court could overrule a charge of impeachment,
assuming that enough voters signed the petition, thus
conditioning the removal of the officer on the further act of the
court.
Likewise, the CCM’s removal remedy under § 12-1, et
seq.30 does not provide an adequate remedy for violation of § 3-3
either, given that removal, like impeachment, is also neither
“immediate” nor mandatory.  Under CCM § 12-3(2) the petition for
recall of an official “shall be signed by not less than twenty
percent (20%) of the voters registered in the last general
election.”  Similar to the 5% voter signatures required for
impeachment proceedings, gathering 20% of signatures for a recall
petition is not a process consistent with the immediacy language
in § 3-3.  Furthermore, CCM § 12-631 specifies that a recall***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)31
such period, the council shall call a special recall
election to be held within the time aforesaid.  If less than
fifty percent (50%) of the voters registered in the last
general election shall vote at such recall election, the
officer sought to be recalled shall not be deemed recalled
regardless of the outcome of the election.
(Emphases added.)
CCM § 12-7 states in part, that “[a] majority vote shall be32
sufficient to recall such officer, subject to the provisions of Section 12-6
of this Article.”
32election “shall be held not less than sixty (60) . . . days after
the petition has been presented to the council.”  Also, CCM § 12-
9 states that “[t]he question of the removal of any officer shall
not be submitted to the voters until such person has served six
(6) months of the term during which the officer is sought to be
recalled.”  Applying these two sections, at the earliest, an
officer could only be recalled after eight months of service. 
Again, an eight month hiatus could not reasonably be considered
immediate removal.  Thus, the recall remedy under § 12-1, et seq.
cannot implement the immediacy requirement in § 3-3 that a
“council member shall immediately forfeit office.”  (Emphasis
added.)
The recall remedy in § 12-6 is also a discretionary
measure.  First, 20% of the county’s voters must exercise their
discretion to sign the petition.  Second, the county clerk has
discretion to deem whether the petition is sufficient for
certification.  Finally, if the petition results in a recall
election, at least 50% of the registered voters must vote, and of
that, recall will not take effect without a majority vote.32 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
33Voting decisions are discretionary.  Thus, the recall remedy
under § 12-1, et seq. may not create a mandatory “vacancy” of the
council member’s seat under § 3-3, if the voters vote not to
recall the council member. 
Allowing for discretionary remedies under either
impeachment or recall, renders the “vacancy” language in § 3-3 a
nullity.  Our rules of statutory construction require us to
reject an interpretation of a statute that renders any part of
the statutory language a nullity.   Potter, 89 Hawai# i at 422,
974 P.2d at 62-63.  Because we determine that the plain meaning
and construction of CCM § 3-3 requires a mandatory and immediate
forfeiture of office and that such forfeiture automatically
results in an immediate vacancy of that office, impeachment,
under § 13-13 of the CCM, and recall, under § 12-1, et. seq. of
the CCM, do not apply in this case.  Inasmuch as the court
concluded to the contrary, the March 19 Order must be reversed.
B.
The second issue, with respect to the first question on
appeal, is whether a declaratory action is an available method of
relief under § 3-3 of the CCM.  Both parties cite to HRS § 632-1
to support their positions.  Kaho# ohalahala maintains that
declaratory judgment is not available, because other remedies of
impeachment, recall, or even quo warranto are available. 
According to Kaho# ohalahala, under HRS § 632-1, “[w]here . . . a
statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
See supra note 17.33
34case, that statutory remedy shall be followed.”  But, as
discussed supra, impeachment and recall under the CCM cannot
properly effect the mandatory and immediacy requirements under
§ 3-3; thus impeachment and recall cannot be special remedies in
this case.  
As to the remedy of quo warranto, this common law
remedy was codified in the HRS under chapter 659 and is defined
by § 659-1.33  Quo warranto is “a common-law writ used to inquire
into the authority by which a public office is held or a
franchise is claimed.”  Black’s Law Dictionary at 1371.  
There are two modes of proceeding judicially to ascertain
and enforce the forfeiture of a charter for default or abuse
of power.  The one is by scire facias; and that process is
proper where there is a legal existing body, capable of
acting, but who have abused their power.  The other mode is
by information in the nature of a quo warranto; which is in
form a criminal, and in its nature a civil remedy; and that
proceeding applies where there is a body corporate de facto
only, but who take upon themselves to act, though from some
defect in their constitution, they cannot legally exercise
their powers.
Id. (quoting 2 James Kent, Commentaries on American Law 313
(George Comstock ed., 11th ed. 1866)).  In this case, as
Plaintiffs correctly state, there is no specific legal body to
enforce § 3-3.  The following additional definition clarifies the
availability of this remedy:  
The remedy or proceeding by which the sovereign or state
determines the legality of a claim which a party asserts to
the use or exercise of an office or franchise and ousts the
holder from its enjoyment, if the claim is not well founded,
or if the right to enjoy the privilege has been forfeited or
lost.
Ballantine’s Law Dictionary 1049-50 (3d ed. 1969).  As construed***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Plaintiffs allege that Kaho# ohalahala improperly raised this34
argument only on appeal, but did not raise it in the proceedings below, thus
it cannot be argued on appeal.  However, as Plaintiffs raised the argument for
quo warranto relief below and through the appeal of the denial of their motion
for leave to amend, Kaho# ohalahala’s argument is responsive to that issue. 
The action for declaratory judgment was brought under Act 162,35
S.L. 1921, which stated: 
Section 1. In cases of actual controversy, courts of record,
within the scope of their respective jurisdictions, shall
have power to make binding adjudications of right, whether
or not consequential relief is, or at the time could be,
claimed, and no action or proceeding shall be open to
objection on the ground that a judgment or order merely
declaratory of right is prayed for. Controversies involving
the interpretation of deeds, wills, other instruments of
writing, statutes, municipal ordinances, and other
governmental regulations, may be so determined, and this
enumeration does not exclude other instances of actual
antagonistic assertion and denial of right.
Section 2. Declaratory judgments may be obtained and
reviewed as other judgments, according to the laws of the
Territory of Hawaii relating to civil procedure.
Section 3. Further relief based on a declaratory judgment
may be granted whenever necessary or proper. The application
shall be by petition to a court having jurisdiction to grant
the relief. If the application be deemed sufficient, the
court shall, on reasonable notice, require any adverse party
whose rights have been adjudicated by the declaration of
right, to show cause why further relief should not be
granted forthwith.
Section 4. When a declaration of right or the granting of
further relief based thereon shall involve the determination
(co
ntinued...)
35supra, § 3-3 automatically and instantly creates a forfeiture and
vacancy of office.  Thus, quo warranto would seem to be an
appropriate remedy under the allegations in this case.  
Kaho#ohalahala relies on cases from foreign
jurisdictions and Kaleikau for the proposition that declaratory
relief cannot replace already-existing procedures such as
petitions for quo warranto.34  In Kaleikau, petitioners filed a
petition under the declaratory judgment statute, Act 162 S.L.
1921,35 against sixteen people of the Hale O Na Alii O Hawai# i***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)35
of issues of fact triable by a jury, such issues may be
submitted to a jury in the form of interrogatories, with
proper instructions by the court, whether a general verdict
be required or not.
Section 5. The parties to a proceeding to obtain a
declaratory judgment may stipulate with reference to the
allowance of costs, and in the absence of such stipulation
the court may make such an award of costs as may seem
equitable and just.
Section 6. This Act is declared to be remedial; its purpose
is to afford relief from the uncertainty and insecurity
attendant upon controversies over legal rights, without
requiring one of the parties interested so to invade the
rights asserted by the other as to entitle him to maintain
an ordinary action therefor; and it is to be liberally
interpreted and administered, with a view to making the
courts more serviceable to the people. 
Kaleikau, 27 Haw. at 424-25.
36society who were allegedly  “illegally claiming and pretending to
be the duly elected officers of the society.”  27 Haw. at 21. 
This court indicated that a declaratory judgment action was not
the appropriate avenue to remove an officer, because there the
alleged injury (usurpation of office) had already occurred, and,
thus, the injury was not merely an uncertain threat which could
only have been remedied through declaratory judgment but,
instead, was an actual injury with already prescribed remedies,
i.e., quo warranto.  Id. at 427-29.  This court noted that “it is
evident from the language of the act itself that it was not the
intention of the legislature to provide a new remedy or method of
procedure for cases for which an adequate remedy and method of
procedure had already been provided” and is “not to provide new
or additional remedies where remedies already existed.”  Id. at ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
It does not appear in the record that it has been factually36
determined whether Kaho# ohalahala was a resident ofLana’i for purposes of his
public office residency requirement.  In Dupree, this court affirmed the
Board’s decision that Kaho# ohalahala was not a resident ofLana’i for purposes
of voter registration.  See supra note 2.  But, the issue of whether
Kaho#ohalahala was actually a resident ofLana’i for public office purposes
appears to be unresolved on any factual basis.  In fact, the court’s March 19
Order (re Motion for Judgment on Pleadings) states, “[Kaho# ohalahala’s] motion
does not seek such a determination.”  Plaintiffs argue that Kaho
#ohalahala’s
non-residency status should have been deemed admitted.  
37428.  This appears similar to the facts of the case at bar, where
the injury (usurpation of office) has been alleged to have
actually occurred and another remedy, quo warranto, already
exists.36 
Plaintiffs do correctly point out that HRS § 659-10,
relating to quo warranto and enacted after the ruling in
Kaleikau, states that “[n]othing in this chapter shall preclude
the obtaining of relief available by quo warranto by other
appropriate action.”  (Emphasis added.)  In this regard,
Plaintiffs assert that the legislature's enactment of HRS
§ 659-10 superceded Kaleikau.  However, the legislative history
for HRS § 659-10 is inconclusive on whether the statute rejected
Kaleikau.  The changes made to the quo warranto chapter were part
of the legislature's effort to coordinate the HRS, "eliminate
inconsistencies; delete outmoded provisions; make improvements of
a technical nature; and transfer procedural matters to court
rules where advisable."  H. Spec. Comm. Rep. No. 9, in 1972 House
Journal, at 1116.  Furthermore, the section amending
extraordinary legal remedies, including quo warranto, states ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
The other amendments are not relevant to this case.  See 192537
Revised Laws of Hawai# i § 2918, at 1049 (recodifying the section); Revised
Laws of Hawai #i 1935 § 4220, at 687 (recodifying the section); Revised Laws of
Hawai#i 1945 § 9971, at 280 (adding a new paragraph regarding the application
of the declaratory judgments); 1955 Revised Laws of Hawai #i § 228-1, at 1403;
1968 Hawai #i Revised Statute § 632-1 at 1403 (recodifying the section); 1972
Haw. Sess. L. Act 89, § 1, at 338 (adding limitation on the use of declaratory
judgment in cases of taxes, divorce or annulment of marriage); 1984 Haw. Sess.
Laws Act 90 § 1, at 166 (substituting proper section or chapter numbers,
changing capitalization for uniformity). 
38that, “[t]he deletion of the statutory provisions on mandamus,
certiorari, prohibition, and other extraordinary legal remedies
does not signify that the writs have been abolished.  The matter
is covered by rules of court and case law.”  Id. at 1124
(emphases added).  This implies that in adopting HRS § 659-10,
the legislature did not intend to specifically eschew Kaleikau,
but instead, the statute was merely enacted to uphold existing
rules and case law. 
Plaintiffs alternatively assert that under the current
version of HRS § 632-1, declaratory judgment affords the same
relief as quo warranto and that declaratory relief is not barred,
even when other common law remedies (like quo warranto,
Plaintiffs assert) are available.  See supra note 3.  The
declaratory judgment act, Act 162, S. L. 1921, enacted two years
before Kaleikau and later recodified as HRS § 632-1, has been
amended since the disposition in Kaleikau.  The subsequent
pertinent amendment to the declaratory judgment statute was made
by Act 74, S.L. 1945, which added the second paragraph in the
current version of HRS §632-1.37  As reproduced supra, at note 3,
that paragraph states: ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
39Relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in civil cases
where an actual controversy exists between contending
parties, or where the court is satisfied that antagonistic
claims are present between the parties involved which
indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or where in any
such case the court is satisfied that a party asserts a
legal relation, status, right, or privilege in which the
party has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge
or denial of the asserted relation, status, right, or
privilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a
concrete interest therein, and the court is satisfied also
that a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the
uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.
Where, however, a statute provides a special form of remedy
for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be
followed; but the mere fact that an actual or threatened
controversy is susceptible of relief through a general
common law remedy, a remedy equitable in nature, or an
extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is
recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debar a
party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment
in any case where the other essentials to such relief are
present.
HRS § 632-1 (emphasis added).  
The portion of the foregoing paragraph that states
“[w]here . . . a statute provides a special form of remedy for a
specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be
followed[,]” HRS § 632-1, appears to be consistent with
Kaleikau’s holding that declaratory judgment relief is not
available when there are other already existing forms of relief. 
However the language following, “but the mere fact that an actual
or threatened controversy is susceptible of relief through a
general common law remedy, a remedy equitable in nature, or an
extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is recognized or
regulated by statute or not, shall not debar a party from the
privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment in any case where
the other essentials to such relief are present,” puts into
question whether Kaleikau is still good law.  Because the***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
40underscored part of the paragraph above appears inconsistent, a
review of legislative history is appropriate.  T-Mobile USA, Inc.

The Senate Committee on the Judiciary stated that “the
purpose of this bill is to expand the proceedings for declaratory
judgments to a scope that will render such proceedings of real
value[.]”  S. Stand. Com. Rep. No. 235, in the 1945 Senate
Journal at 656.  The committee noted that “[t]he present chapter
of the Revised Laws of Hawai# i 1945 on declaratory judgments has
been so narrowly construed that the bar generally, hesitates to
make use of it.”  Id. at 657.  Significantly, the House Committee
on the Judiciary stated, “[t]his bill . . . will afford greater
relief by declaratory judgment than the present law.  The
benefits sought to be had under present law have been negatived
by two decisions of our Supreme Court.”  H. Stand. Com. Rep. No.***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
Prior to the 1945 amendment, this court decided a total of three38
cases that referenced prior versions of the declaratory judgment act, which
subsequently became HRS § 623-1 -- Pires v. Phillips, 31 Haw. 720, 720 (Haw.
Terr. 1930) (referencing chapter 170, R.L. 1925), Kaaa v. Waiakea Mill, 29
Haw. 122, 125 (Haw. Terr. 1926) (referencing chapter 170, R.L. 1925), and
Kaleikau, 27 Haw. at 421 (referencing Act 162, S.L. 1921).  In Pires, the
petitioner sought a declaratory judgment of whether a provision in his lease
that stated “‘[t]hat he’ (the leesee) ‘will not commit or suffer any waste of
said premises, nor cut or in any way destroy any of the inia and algaroba
trees now growing on said demised premises, excepting for right of ways,
trails, roads and in case of necessity[,]” prevented him from clearing “cactus
or panini” “in order to clear the land for the cultivation of pineapples.” 
Pires, 31 Haw. at 722.  The respondent demurred to the petition on the ground
that the court did not have jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment. 
The court overruled the demurrer and the respondent excepted.  Id. at 721. 
Pires, without any discussion on jurisdiction, held that the exception could
not be sustained and that “[petitioner] in removing the cactus from the
premises in question will not be committing waste; but will be acting strictly
within his legal rights.”  Id. at 723.  Inasmuch as Pires did not limit the
scope or benefit of the declaratory judgment statute, it was likely not one of
the two cases that was considered by the legislature when it noted that “two
decisions by our Supreme Court” “negatived” the “benefits sought under present
law[.]”  Stand. Com. Rep. No. 76, in 1945 House Journal, at 566.
On the other hand, both Kaaa and Kaleikau restricted jurisdiction
under the declaratory statute.  As discussed supra, Kaleikau held that in an
action seeking to obtain a declaratory judgment, the court did not have
jurisdiction where the respondents were not merely threatening to invade the
rights of the petitioners, but had already infringed these rights, and an
immediate cause of action in quo warranto existed.  In Kaaa, petitioners,
holders of homestead lots at Waiakea, Maui who signed agreements made with
respondent Waiakea Mill Company, filed a petition seeking declaratory
judgment.  29 Haw. at 122-23.  The petition alleged that the respondent
violated the terms of the agreements and therefore “an actual controversy
exist[ed] between each of the [petitioners] and the respondent” which
“require[d] the determination of the court under the Declaratory Judgment Act
(Ch. 170, R.L. 1925) in that [petitioners] ‘assert their right to the
rescission . . . ’ of said agreement[.]”  Id. at 125.  The respondent filed a
demurrer.  Id.  The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the
petition.  Id.  On appeal, one of the issues was whether the petition
“state[d] facts sufficient to give the petitioners a cause of action against
respondent under the Declaratory Judgement Act.”  Id. at 126.  This court
determined that “a cause of action or suit under established methods of
procedure, ha[d] accrued in favor of petitioners,” and recognized that
Kaleikau held that “courts will not entertain jurisdiction under the
Declaratory Judgment Act when it appears that the wrongs complained of have
already been committed and the cause of action already exists, but will leave
the injured party to seek redress according to the established methods of
procedure.”  Id. at 127-28.  
Further, Kaaa rejected petitioners’ contention that “all that was
held in [Kaleikau] was that the court would not take jurisdiction under the
declaratory judgment law when there is some other statutory mode of proceeding
provided for.”  Id. at 128 (emphasis in original).  Instead, Kaaa asserted
(continued...)
4176, in 1945 House Journal, at 566.  The two decisions are not
referenced in the legislative history but it appears that one of
the cases referred to was Kaleikau.38  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
(...continued)38
that Kaleikau “show[ed] clearly” that “relief under the Declaratory Judgment
Act was not obtainable where relief was already obtainable under established
methods of procedure” and “did not base its decision on the fact that relief
was provided for by statute[.]”  Id.  Therefore, Kaaa rejected the
petitioners’ contention that declaratory judgment was applicable because
“there was no reason to believe that . . . in an appropriate action at law or
suit in equity, the courts have not ample power to afford petitioners full,
adequate and complete relief.”  Id. at 127.  Because Kaaa and Kaleikau both
established the limitations on a court’s jurisdiction under the declaratory
judgment act, it is probable that the Committee on the Judiciary was referring
to these two cases in its Committee Report.
Under HRS § 632-1, all "other essentials" for declaratory relief39
must be met. 
42In light of the desire to afford greater relief under
the declaratory statute and the reference to “two decisions of
our Supreme Court” which “negatived” benefits under the statute,
the legislative history suggests that in amending section 9976 of
the Revised Laws of Hawai #i 1945, the legislature intended to
“afford [citizens] greater relief” under the declaratory judgment
statute than that given in Kaleikau.  Thus, Kaleikau does not
appear to preclude Petitioner from bringing a declaratory
judgment action under the current HRS § 632-1, even though quo
warranto relief is available provided that “the other essentials
to such relief are present.”  HRS § 632-1.39  
Here, a claim for quo warranto is not before this
court.  Thus, it would be premature for this court to determine
whether quo warranto is the only appropriate remedy to the
exclusion of an action for declaratory judgment before that
question is presented to the court on remand.  Because we
conclude that it would be premature to decide whether quo ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
On remand, of course, this decision does not require that40
Plaintiffs proceed under both declaratory judgment and quo warranto.
HRCP Rule 15(a) (2000) states in part, that “a party may amend the41
party’s pleading . . . by leave of court . . . ; and leave shall be freely
given when justice so requires.”
43warranto precludes a declaratory judgment action, the March 19
Order Granting [Kaho #ohalahala’s] Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings must also be reversed on this ground.40  
VII.
In that connection, the second question raised on
appeal is whether the court abused its discretion when it denied
Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint to designate quo warranto
as a form of relief.  As noted before, unless there is an
apparent reason indicating otherwise, under HRCP Rule 15(a),
leave to amend “shall be freely given” to a party to amend its
complaint “when justice so requires.”41  See Hirasa, 68 Haw. at
26, 702 P.2d at 775.  This court reviews a denial of leave to
amend a complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule 15(a) under the abuse of
discretion standard.  Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Hawaii,
Ltd., 100 Hawai #i 149, 158, 58 P.3d 1196, 1205 (2002) (stating
that “this court reviews the [court’s] denial of a motion to
amend a complaint under the abuse of discretion standard”).  “An
abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant.”  State ex rel. Bronster v. U.S. Steel Corp., 82 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
44Hawai#i 32, 54, 919 P.2d 294, 316 (1996) (internal citations
omitted).  
This court has previously held that Rule 15(a) of the
HRCP is functionally identical to Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure.  Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp, 89 Hawai# i at
162 n.1, 969 P.2d at 1280 n.1.  “Where a Hawai #i rule of civil
procedure is identical to the federal rule, the interpretation of
this rule by federal courts is highly persuasive.”  Id. (quoting
Wong v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai #i 46, 52, 961 P.2d 611, 617 (1998)
(other citation omitted).  In Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181
(1962), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the Court of Appeals
had erred in affirming the District Court's denial of
petitioner's motion to vacate the judgment in order to allow
amendment of the complaint. “As appears from the record, the
amendment would have done no more than state an alternative
theory for recovery.”  Foman, 371 U.S. at 182.  The Court went on
to state:   
Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend "shall be freely
given when justice so requires"; this mandate is to be
heeded.  If the underlying facts or circumstances relied
upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he
ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the
merits.  In the absence of any apparent or declared reason
-- such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the
part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by
amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the
opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,
futility of amendment, etc. - the leave sought should, as
the rules require, be "freely given."  Of course, the grant
or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the
discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to
grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for
the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely
abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of
the Federal Rules.***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
In his Answering Brief Kaho #ohalahala refers back to the record,42
specifically his memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to
amend, where it states, “In light of this motion, [Kaho #ohalahala] -- as a
sitting member of the Maui County Council –- tendered his defense in this case
to Corporation Counsel, but was told that Corporation Counsel would not
represent him at this time.”  As noted before, there is no reason given for
Corporation Counsel’s denial.  It may be that if Kaho #ohalahala continues to
be sued in his personal capacity, Corporation Counsel cannot yet represent
him.  But it appears that Corporation Counsel has not foreclosed the
possibility of representing him in the future, should he later be sued in his
official capacity.  It appears that Corporation Counsel simply declined to
tender his defense “at this time,” i.e., while he is sued in his personal
capacity.  
45Id. (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).  Here, an
amendment to the complaint alleging a claim of quo warranto would
do “no more than state an alternate theory” for relief.  Id.
Although Kaho# ohalahala asserts that he would suffer
prejudice if the amendment were allowed, the assertion is not
persuasive.  According to Kaho #ohalahala, when sued in his
official capacity, Corporation Counsel had a duty to represent
him, but because Corporation Counsel previously refused to
represent him, he would be faced with having to resort to
privately-retained counsel, incurring personal costs and
expenses.42  This argument is unavailing because as Plaintiffs
correctly point out, in a quo warranto proceeding Kaho# ohalahala
would still face the lawsuit in his personal capacity, as the
suit is brought in the name of the State.  HRS § 659-1 defines
quo warranto as “an order issuing in the name of the State by a
circuit court and directed to a person who claims or usurps an
office of the State, or of any subdivision thereof.”  (Emphasis
added.)  Moreover, this issue was not definitively resolved by ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
46the court below as there is no clear indication that the court
denied the motion to amend due to prejudice against
Kaho#ohalahala.  The only statement recorded refers to the
court’s incorrect finding at the hearing on the motion for
judgment on the pleadings that § 3-3 imposed a duty upon the
officer to forfeit his office and that failure to do so
constituted nonfeasance, as to which declaratory judgment would
not be an appropriate remedy.  
“The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its
ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous
assessment of the evidence.”  Lepere v. United Pub. Workers,
Local 646, 77 Hawai #i 471, 473, 887 P.2d 1029, 1031 (1995)
(quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Given the lack of any
findings of prejudice against Kaho #ohalahala or findings of any
other exception warranting denial to amend the complaint, and
given that the court appears to have based its denial on a wrong
view of the law, it must be concluded that there was an abuse of
discretion.  As Plaintiffs were apparently attempting to state an
alternative theory of relief by way of quo warranto, leave to
amend the complaint should have been granted.  Because leave to
amend should otherwise be “freely given,” HRCP Rule 15(a), the
May 7 Order denying Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend its
complaint must be reversed.  On remand, the court is ordered to
permit Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to include quo
warranto relief.***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

For the reasons stated herein, the court’s March 19
Order and May 7 Order are reversed, the Judgment is vacated, and
the case remanded for disposition consistent with this opinion.
