GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner-Appellant,
vs.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee.
                                                                 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(SPP NO. 09-1-0018 (CR. NO. 05-1-0946))
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration of
the February 4, 2010 order dismissing the motion for a writ of
habeas corpus, it appears that the motion for reconsideration,
filed in the appellate court on March 16, 2010, is untimely.  See
HRAP 40(a) (“A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party
only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion,
dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional
time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the
appellate court involved.”).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
reconsideration is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 22, 2010.
