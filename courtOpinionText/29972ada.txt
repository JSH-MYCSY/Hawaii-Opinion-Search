hold that the Hawai' i Labor Relations Board (“HLRB”) had 
“exclusive original jurisdiction” over the statutory issues raised by HGEA, and that the circuit court should have deferred 
ruling on the constitutional issues until after the HLRB had the 
opportunity to resolve the statutory questions.

I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Executive Order 09-02
 
On June 24, 2009, Lingle issued executive order 09-02. 
Therein it was observed that “the widespread impact of the global
 
financial crisis and constantly decreasing revenue projections by
 
the [state] Council on Revenues . . . forced the State of Hawaii
 
to make drastic and unprecedented revenue and expenditure
 
adjustments to close a budget shortfall of approximately two
 
billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) through the fiscal biennium
 
2009-2011[.]” (Brackets and ellipsis added.) It observed
 
further that, “based on the May 28, 2009 projections by the
 
[state] Council on Revenue, the State of Hawaii is . . . facing
 
an additional deficit of seven hundred thirty million dollars
 
($730,000,000) through the fiscal biennium 2009-2011, resulting
 
in an immediate fiscal emergency of unparalleled magnitude[.]” 
In light of the current revenue estimates, executive
 
4
order 09-02 ordered the furlough  of certain state executive
branch employees for a total of seventy-two work days over the
 
5
fiscal biennium 2009-2011,  which was to become effective on July
1, 2009, and subject to certain terms and conditions. 
Among
 
these terms and conditions was the requirement that the affected
 
state executive branch employees’ pay would be “automatically
 
4
 Executive order number 09-02 defined a “furlough” as “the
placement of an employee temporarily and involuntarily in a non-pay and non-
duty status by the Employer because of lack of work or funds, or other non-
disciplinary reasons.” 
5
 Executive order number 09-02 required that thirty-six furlough
days were to be taken during each of fiscal years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011.
 
4
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
adjusted” by reducing the affected employee’s pay between 13.8%
 
and 15.8% each pay period to account for the furlough days. 
Although executive order 09-02 was issued on June 24,
 
2009, on June 1, 2009, Lingle publicly announced her plan to,
 
among other things, furlough certain state executive branch
 
employees for “3 days/24 hours each month, from July 1, 2009 to
 
June 30, 2011, thereby unilaterally reducing employees’ hours and
 
cutting employees’ wages approximately 13.8%.” 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings
 
After Lingle’s June 1, 2009 announcement, on June 16, 
2009, HGEA filed a complaint in the circuit court that sought, 
among other things, a declaratory judgment that Lingle “cannot 
unilaterally impose the furloughs,” and a preliminary and 
permanent injunction enjoining Lingle from “unilaterally 
imposing” the same. HGEA based its request for relief on article 
XIII, section 2 of the Hawai' i constitution and HRS Chapter 89. 
In a first amended complaint filed on June 22, 2009,
 
HGEA averred that Lingle “intends to unilaterally implement new
 
procedures regarding layoffs after June 20, 2009 and impose mass
 
state employee[] layoffs” “if her furlough plan is blocked by the
 
courts.” As such, HGEA also sought a declaratory judgment that
 
Lingle cannot “unilaterally impose new layoff procedures,” and a
 
preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Lingle from
 
“unilaterally imposing” the same. 
On June 23, 2009, HGEA filed a motion for preliminary
 
injunction. Briefly summarized, in its memorandum in support of
 
its motion, HGEA asserted that collective bargaining is a
 
5
   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
constitutionally protected right and statutorily mandated. HGEA
 
also asserted that furloughs are a “mandatory and core subject of
 
collective bargaining” pursuant to HRS Chapter 89 and common law,
 
and the common law “unilateral change” doctrine prevents Lingle
 
from unilaterally imposing furloughs during the pendency of an
 
arbitration process between it and the public employers.6
 
On June 29, 2009, Lingle filed her opposition to HGEA’s 
motion for preliminary injunction. Among the arguments made, 
Lingle asserted that HGEA’s assertions are “predominately 
prohibited practices complaints that fall under HLRB’s ‘exclusive 
primary jurisdiction.’” Lingle also asserted that (1) the 
“management rights” in HRS § 89-9(d) gives her authority to 
furlough “unionized workers” and these “rights” are not subject 
to collective bargaining, (2) the furlough order is consistent 
with article XIII, section 2 of the Hawai' i constitution, (3) the 
furlough order does not violate the unilateral change doctrine, (4) HGEA’s complaints about layoff procedures are premature and
 
within HLRB’s jurisdiction even when ripe, (5) HGEA has not shown
 
that they will suffer irreparable damage if the preliminary
 
6 We note that the circuit court made the following findings that
appear to be undisputed between the parties:
 
3. HGEA, as the exclusive collective bargaining
representative for collective bargaining units 2, 3, 4, 9,
and 13, entered into collective bargaining agreements with
the public employers, including the State of Hawaii, for the
period July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009.
4. By Memorandum of Agreement, dated February 20,
2009, HGEA and the public employers, including the State of
Hawaii, agreed to an impasse, negotiation, mediation, and
interest arbitration procedure for reaching the successor
collective bargaining agreements, effective July 1, 2009.
 
6
   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
injunction is denied, and (6) the public interest requires
 
denying the injunction. 
On July 28, 2009, the circuit court filed its findings 
of fact, conclusions of law, and order that, among other things, 
granted in part HGEA’s motion for preliminary injunction.7 
Therein, the circuit court made the following pertinent conclusions: (1) pursuant to United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 
646, AFL-CIO v. Yogi, 101 Hawai' i 46, 62 P.3d 189 (2002) and 
Malahoff v. Saito, 111 Hawai' i 168, 140 P.3d 401 (2006), Lingle’s 
unilateral decision to furlough certain unionized state executive 
branch employees “infringed on core subjects of collective 
bargaining [(namely, wages)], in violation of article XIII, 
section 2 of the Hawaii constitution[,]”; (2) pursuant to NLRB v. 
Katz, 369 U.S. 736 (1962), “certain terms and conditions of an 
expired agreement continue in effect by operation of law” and, 
inasmuch as the furloughs “change wages,” the furloughs “cannot 
be imposed by unilateral action[,]”; (3) essentially, inasmuch as 
“the courts retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional 
claims[,]” Lingle’s assertion that the HLRB has exclusive 
jurisdiction over this matter is unpersuasive; (4) United Pub. 
Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Hannemann, 106 Hawai' i 359, 
105 P.3d 236 (2005) is inapposite; (5) Lingle’s reliance on the “managerial rights” provisions in HRS § 89-9(d) “to justify 
unilateral imposition of the furlough program cannot be accepted 
because it would allow lawmakers absolute discretion to define 
7
 The circuit court, “in the interests of judicial efficiency,” also
entered a permanent injunction in favor of HGEA and against Lingle. 
7
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
the scope of collective bargaining, thereby defeating the intent
 
of [a]rticle XIII, [s]ection 2[,]”; and (6) the issues of layoff
 
procedures and criteria are not ripe for consideration at this
 
time. 
A final judgment was filed on June 28, 2009. On 
July 31, 2009, Lingle timely filed a notice of appeal. 
On September 1, 2009, Lingle filed an application to
 
transfer her appeal from the Intermediate Court of Appeals to
 
this court. On September 22, 2009, this court granted Lingle’s
 application for transfer.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
“Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction 
is a question of law reviewable de novo.” Hawaii Mgmt. Alliance 
Ass’n v. Ins. Comm’r, 106 Hawai' i 21, 27, 100 P.3d 952, 957 (2004) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
“Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of 
law reviewable de novo.” Gump v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 93 
Hawai'i 417, 420, 5 P.3d 407, 410 (2000). In our review of 
questions of statutory interpretation, this court follows certain 
well-established principles, as follows: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Second,
where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole
 
8
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third,
implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language
contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt,
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. And fifth, in
construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous
words may be sought by examining the context, with which the
ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order
to ascertain their true meaning.
 
Awakuni v. Awana, 115 Hawai' i 126, 133, 165 P.3d 1027, 1034 (2007) 
(citation omitted). 
C. Constitutional Law
 
“[T]his court reviews questions of constitutional law 
de novo, under the right/wrong standard.” Jou v. Dai-Tokyo Royal 
State Ins. Co., 116 Hawai' i 159, 164-65, 172 P.3d 471, 476-77 
(2007) (quoting Onaka v. Onaka, 112 Hawai' i 374, 378, 146 P.3d 89, 
93 (2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Lingle asserts that HRS § 89-14 (1993) gives the HLRB
 
original jurisdiction over the statutory claims in this case, and
 
the circuit court acted beyond its jurisdiction by ruling on
 questions intended exclusively for HLRB. HGEA asserts that the
 circuit court properly exercised jurisdiction in this case
 because HLRB’s jurisdiction is limited to the extent that the
 courts, and not the HLRB, “can (1) decide constitutional
 
9
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
questions and (2) grant injunctive relief.”8
 
HRS § 89-14 provides, in its entirety:
 
Any controversy concerning prohibited practices may be
submitted to the board in the same manner and with the same
 
effect as provided in section 377-9; provided that the board
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over such a
controversy except that nothing herein shall preclude (1)
the institution of appropriate proceedings in circuit court
pursuant to section 89-12(e) or (2) the judicial review of
decisions or orders of the board in prohibited practice
controversies in accordance with section 377-9 and chapter
91. All references in section 377-9 to “labor organization”
shall include employee organization.
 
Contrary to HGEA’s assertions, pursuant to HRS § 89-14,
 
original jurisdiction in this case properly resided with the HLRB
 
and not the circuit court. In 1981, the Intermediate Court of
 Appeals (“ICA”) filed a published opinion in Winslow v. State, 2
 Haw. App. 50, 625 P.2d 1046 (1981). In Winslow, two of the
 issues addressed by the ICA were (1) “[w]hether grievance
 procedures established in the labor agreement to resolve disputes
 between the public employer and union members apply to an action
 against the union as well[,]” and (2) “[w]hether [the Hawaii
 
8 We agree with the dissent that “the litigation between HGEA and
[Lingle] is settled and the furlough controversy is moot.” Dissent at 10. 
However, the instant case satisfies the public interest exception to themootness doctrine. “[W]hen the question involved affects the public interestand an authoritative determination is desirable for the guidance of publicofficials, a case will not be considered moot.” Doe v. Doe, 116 Hawai' i 323,
327, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007) (quoting Slupecki v. Admin. Dir. of theCourts, 110 Hawai' i 407, 409 n.4, 133 P.3d 1199, 1201 n.4 (2006)) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Under this exception to the mootness doctrine, “welook to ‘(1) the public or private nature of the question presented, (2) thedesirability of an authoritative determination for future guidance of publicofficers, and (3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question.” Id. 
(citation omitted). We also agree with the dissent’s analysis of these threefactors, see dissent at 14 n.8, inasmuch as we conclude that the publicinterest exception to the mootness doctrine is satisfied by these reasons.

 ] Public Employment Relations Board (‘HPERB’)  has exclusive
jurisdiction to hear complaints of unfair labor practices brought
 
against a union by a union member[.]” Id.
 at 51-52, 625 P.2d at
 
1048-49. 
With regard to the first issue, the ICA ultimately held
 
that the “appellant could not be required to exhaust contractual
 remedies in an action against the union where no such remedies
 actually exist” because, “in the enactment of the contract’s
 grievance procedures, it was not contemplated that the employee
 would utilize the procedures in a grievance against the union[]
 itself[.]” Id. at 56, 625 P.2d at 1051.
 
However, with regard to the second issue, the ICA 
pointed out that an employee in this situation “is not left remediless,” and, in Hawai' i, “such an employee apparently has two 
options.” Id. The first option recognized by the ICA in its 
opinion was the filing of a complaint in the HPERB. See id. 
However, the ICA stated that the HPERB’s “jurisdiction in these matters . . . is not exclusive.” Id. (ellipsis added). 
According to the ICA: “In the face of the allegations that the 
9
 In 1985, the HPERB became the HLRB. See 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 
251, § 4 at 476.

 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
union is guilty of prohibited practices,[] the statutes [ 10
] permit
such action to be brought before the [HPERB] or in a court of
 
competent jurisdiction.”11 Id. (footnote added and omitted); see
 
Santos v. State, Dept. of Transp., Kauai Div., 64 Haw. 648, 655
 n.12, 646 P.2d 962, 967 n.12 (1982) (recognizing that Winslow
 held in part that “under HRS § 89-14 prohibited practices whether
 committed by the employer, employee, or employee organization can
 be taken before HPERB or in a court of competent jurisdiction”). 
As such, the second option recognized by the ICA was the filing
 of a complaint “in a court of competent jurisdiction.” See
 Winslow, 2 Haw. App. at 56, 625 P.2d at 1051.
 
At the time 
Winslow was decided, HRS § 89-14 provided: 
“Any controversy concerning prohibited practices may be submitted
 
to the board in the same manner and with the same effect as
 
provided in section 377-9. All references in section 377-9 to
 
10 Apparently, the ICA was referring to the versions of HRS § 89-14
and HRS § 377-9 in effect at the time, see Winslow, 2 Haw. App. at 56-57, 625
P.2d at 1051-52, and are quoted infra.
 
11 In other words, the ICA concluded:
 
It seems clear . . . that under HRS § 89-14 prohibited
practices whether committed by the employer, employee, or
employee organization are to be treated in the same manner
as unfair labor practices under HRS § 377-9. From a policy
standpoint, it may have been preferable for appellant to
pursue her relief from HPERB; however, nothing in the
statute precludes this action from being brought in circuit
court as well. 
Winslow, 2 Haw. App. at 57, 625 P.2d at 1052 (ellipsis, emphasis, and brackets
added).
 
12
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
‘board’ shall include the Hawaii public employment relations
 
board and ‘labor organization’ shall include employee
 
organization.” 2 Haw. App. at 56-57, 625 P.2d at 1051 (quoting
 
HRS § 89-14).12
 
However, in 1982, Hawaii’s legislature amended HRS §
 
89-14 to “legislatively . . . overrule[]” Winslow because it
 
disagreed with the ICA’s interpretation of HRS § 89-14 and HRS §
 377-9. A standing committee report was issued by the Committee
 on Public Employment and Government Operations that stated, in
 pertinent part, as follows:
 
The purpose of this bill is to make the jurisdiction
of the [HPERB] in controversies relating to prohibited
practices exclusive except as otherwise provided in Chapter
89, [HRS].
 
. . . .
 Recently, the [ICA], in [Winslow], construed sections
89-14 and 377-9, HRS, and concluded that the jurisdiction of
the [HPERB] over controversies concerning prohibited (unfair
labor) practices in the public sector is not exclusive, and
that a prohibited practice complaint or action may be
brought either before HPERB or in circuit court. In other
 words, the [ICA] concluded that under these two statutory
sections, HPERB and the circuit courts have concurrent
jurisdiction over prohibited practice complaints in the
public sector.
By making the jurisdiction of HPERB exclusive in
controversies concerning prohibited practices, this bill
legislatively rectifies or overrules the judicial conclusion
or statutory construction enunciated in [Winslow].
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 134-82, in 1982 House Journal, at 943
 
(emphases in original, brackets added).
 
12
 We note that, at the time Winslow was decided, HRS § 377-9(a)
 
provided: “Any controversy concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted
to the employment relations board in the manner and with the effect provided
in this chapter, but nothing herein shall prevent the pursuit of relief in
courts of competent jurisdiction.” 2 Haw. App. at 57, 625 P.2d at 1052
(quoting HRS § 377-9(a)).
 
13
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
A separate standing committee report was issued by the
 
Committee on Judiciary, which stated:
 
The purpose of this bill is to clarify that the
[HPERB], rather than the courts, has primary jurisdiction
over prohibited practice complaints filed under Chapter 89,
Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
A recent Hawaii Court of Appeals decision interprets
Section 89-14 and 377-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to give
HPERB and the circuit courts concurrent jurisdiction over
prohibited practice complaints. This bill will make it
 clear that HPERB has exclusive original jurisdiction over
prohibited practice complaints. Appeals from HPERB will
continue to be filed in Circuit Court.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 589-82, in 1982 House Journal, at 1164
 
(brackets added).
 
As further explained by the Committee on Human
 
Resources:
 
In 1970, the Legislature created the [HPERB] to
administer the provisions of Chapter 89 in an effort to
promote cooperative relations between the government and its
employees and to protect the public by ensuring orderly
government operations. Thus, the board was given
jurisdiction of prohibited practice cases. Your Committee
 believes the original intent of this provision was to allow
the board, who is the administrative agency with the
expertise in public employment relations, to have primary
jurisdiction of prohibited practice complaints. However, a
recent Hawaii Court of Appeals decision interprets Section
89-14 and 377-9, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to give HPERB and
the circuit court concurrent jurisdiction over prohibited
practice complaints.
This bill will make it clear that HPERB has exclusive
 
original jurisdiction over prohibited practice complaints.
Appeals from HPERB will continue to be filed in Circuit
Court.
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 597-82, in 1982 Senate Journal, at 1202
 
(brackets added).
 
As enacted, the pertinent portions of HRS § 89-14 were
 
14
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
amended to read as it does today.13 See 1982 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 
27, § 1 at 38.
 
In light of the foregoing, the legislature clearly
 
intended for the HLRB to have exclusive original jurisdiction
 
over prohibited practice complaints, and the ICA’s contrary
 interpretation in Winslow was incorrect. See, e.g., H. Stand.
 
Comm. Rep. No. 134-82, in 1982 House Journal, at 943. As it
 applies to this case, what constitutes a “prohibited practice” is
 set forth in HRS § 89-13(a) (Supp. 2003), as follows: 
It shall be a prohibited practice for a public
employer or its designated representative wilfully to: 
. . . .
 
(5) Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith
with the exclusive representative as required in
section 89-9;
(6) Refuse to participate in good faith in the
mediation and arbitration procedures set forth in
section 89-11;
(7) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision
of this chapter;
(8) Violate the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement.
 
(Ellipsis added.)
 
Paragraphs 5 and 7 of HGEA’s first amended complaint
 
alleges:
 
5. The Governor cannot unilaterally impose furloughs
and circumvent the collective bargaining process. Furloughs
reduce employee hours and wages and affect terms and
conditions of employment and, therefore, are a mandatory
subject of collective bargaining negotiation protected by
Article XIII, Section 2 of the Hawaii State Constitution and
 
13
 We note that HRS § 89-14 was amended again in 1985 only to remove
any language referring to the HPERB, inasmuch as the HPERB became the HLRB in
that year. See 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 251, § 6 at 479-80. 
15
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
as prescribed by HRS § 89-9(a). Any disputes over
negotiable subjects, when properly presented, must be
resolved in accordance with the impasse, mediation, and
arbitration process prescribed by HRS § 89-11 and the
Memorandum of Agreement, dated February 20, 2009, between
HGEA and the Employer. The Governor does not have the
 implied right to unilaterally impose furloughs pursuant to
HRS § 89-9(d).
 
. . . .
 7. Alternatively, even if furloughs are not a
mandatory subject of collective bargaining negotiation, and

Viewing the assertions made by HGEA in its first
 
amended complaint in light of HRS § 89-13(a), it appears that
 
HGEA alleges that Lingle essentially engaged in a “prohibited
 
practice” when she unilaterally imposed furloughs. See HRS § 89­
13(a). For example, HRS § 89-13(a)(5) mandates that “[i]t shall
 be a prohibited practice for a public employer . . . willfully to
 
. . . [r]efuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the
 
exclusive representative as required in [HRS §] 89-9[,]” while
 
paragraph 5 of HGEA’s complaint alleges that “[t]he Governor does
 
not have the implied right to unilaterally impose furloughs
 
pursuant to HRS § 89-9(d)” thereby “circumvent[ing] the
 
collective bargaining process” because “[f]urloughs reduce
 
employee hours and wages and affect terms and conditions of
 
employment and, therefore, are a mandatory subject of collective
 
bargaining negotiation protected by Article XIII, Section 2 of
 
the Hawaii State Constitution and as prescribed by HRS § 89­
9(a).” (Brackets added.) Pertinent statutes clearly provide
 
that the HLRB has jurisdiction to “[r]esolve controversies under
 
[HRS chapter 89.]” HRS § 89-5(i)(3) (Supp. 2005) (brackets
 
added); see id. § 89-5(a) (“There is created a Hawaii labor
 
relations board to ensure that collective bargaining is conducted
 
in accordance with this chapter . . . .”); id. § 89-5(i)(4) (“In
 
addition to the powers and functions provided in other sections
 
of this chapter, the board shall . . . conduct proceedings on
 
complaints of prohibited practices by employers . . . and take
 
such actions with respect thereto as it deems necessary and
 
proper[.]”); see also HRS § 89-1(b)(3) (Supp. 2005) (“The
 
17
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
legislature declares that it is the public policy of the State to 
promote harmonious and cooperative relations between government 
and its employees and to protect the public by assuring effective 
and orderly operations of government. These policies are best 
effectuated by . . . [c]reating a labor relations board to 
administer the provisions of [HRS] chapters 89 and 377.”). HRS § 
89-14 provides that the HLRB “shall have exclusive original 
jurisdiction over” “[a]ny controversy concerning prohibited 
practices.” Although HGEA’s complaint does not expressly use the 
words “prohibited practice,” a prohibited practice can be 
logically inferred therefrom because HGEA’s complaint essentially 
alleges, among other things, that Lingle “[r]efuse[d] to bargain 
collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative as 
required in [HRS] section 89-9[,]”, and HRS § 89-13(a)(5) 
mandates that it “shall be a prohibited practice for a public 
employer . . . [to] wil[l]fully . . . [r]efuse” to bargain 
collectively as such. (Emphasis added); see Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 
210, 221, 626 P.2d 173, 181 (1981) (“Generally, pleadings should 
be construed liberally and not technically.”); see also Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 8(a) (instructing that a “pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall 
contain” among other things “a short and plain statement of the 
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief”), 8(f) 
(“All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial 
18
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
justice.”).14 As such, the HLRB has exclusive original
 
jurisdiction over the statutory claims raised in HGEA’s
 
complaint. See HRS § 89-14; HRS § 89-13(a); see also, e.g., H.
 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 134-82, in 1982 House Journal, at 943.
 
Nonetheless, HGEA asserts that the HLRB’s jurisdiction
 
is limited to the extent that a court, and not the HLRB, has
 jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions because HRS § 89­
14 states that “nothing herein shall preclude the judicial review
 
of decisions or orders of the [HLRB] in accordance with [HRS]
 
section 377-9.” In support of its assertion, HGEA then points to
 
the following portion of HRS § 377-9(a) (1993): “Any controversy
 
concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted to the board
 
in the manner and with the effect provided in this chapter, but
 
nothing herein shall prevent the pursuit of relief in courts of
 
competent jurisdiction.”
 
However, HGEA overlooks that the language that it
 
relies on in HRS § 89-14 refers to an appeal from, or “judicial
 
review” of, a “decision[] or order[] of the [HLRB].” See HRS §
 
89-14. Indeed, HRS § 377-9(f) to (h) provides instruction in
 this regard.
15 The HLRB has obviously not filed a decision or
 
14 Moreover, we point out that Intervenors-Appellees, Hawaii State
Teachers Association and United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO
(collectively, “Intervenors”) “acknowledge[d]” in their answering brief “that
the HLRB might have concluded that [Lingle’s] Executive Order was a
‘prohibited practice’ because it violated the statutory duty to bargain in HRS
Chapter 89.” (Emphasis in original.)

the board may obtain a review thereof as provided in chapter

order in this case. Accordingly, HGEA’s assertion is
 
unpersuasive because the language that it relies on in HRS § 89­
14 does not refer to original jurisdiction.
 
HGEA also points out that, (1) in Yogi, this court
 
“addressed whether a legislative statute involving Chapter 89
 
violated a constitutional provision and the Yogi court did not
 
decide that the constitutional issue was within the exclusive
 
jurisdiction of the HLRB,” and (2) the HLRB “itself has held that
 
it lacks jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions.” 
However, the issue in Yogi was whether a legislative amendment to

 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
HRS § 89-9(a) violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to 
organize for the purpose of collective bargaining. See 101 
Hawai'i at 47, 62 P.3d at 190. As such, the issue presented in 
Yogi differs from the issue presented here inasmuch as Yogi did 
not address whether a public employer’s action either violates or 
satisfies a statute that defines the scope of negotiations. See 
HRS § 89-9. On the one hand, HGEA asserted in its first amended complaint that, inter alia, “[f]urloughs reduce employee hours 
and wages and affect terms and conditions of employment and, 
therefore, are a mandatory subject of collective bargaining 
negotiation protected by Article XIII, Section 2 of the Hawaii 
State Constitution and as prescribed by HRS § 89-9(a).” 
(Emphasis added.) On the other hand, Lingle asserted in her 
opposition to HGEA’s motion for preliminary injunction that, 
inter alia, certain “management rights” in HRS § 89-9(d) gives 
her authority to order the furlough of “unionized workers” 
without regard to collective bargaining. In light of these 
arguments, the statutory issue here is quite unlike the issue 
presented in Yogi where a legislative amendment to HRS § 89-9(a) 
was held to have violated the rights of public employees under 
article XIII, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution. See 101 
Hawai'i at 54, 62 P.3d at 197. More specifically, unlike Lingle’s 
reliance on HRS § 89-9(d) in this case, the issue presented in 
Yogi was whether the phrase “as provided by law” in article XIII, 
§ 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution “grant[ed] the legislature 
unfettered discretion to infringe on the core principles of collective bargaining.” Id. at 55, 62 P.3d at 198 (Nakayama, J., 
21
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
concurring). Moreover, original jurisdiction was not at issue in
 
Yogi. Therefore, Yogi is inapposite because Yogi did not address
 
(1) the jurisdiction issue that is presented in this case, and
 
(2) whether a public employer’s action either violates or
 
satisfies HRS § 89-9(a) or (d), respectively.
 
With regard to HGEA’s second point, we read HGEA’s
 
first amended complaint as raising the following two pertinent
 
issues: (1) whether Lingle’s furlough constitutes “a mandatory
 
subject of collective bargaining negotiation protected by Article
 
XIII, Section 2 of the Hawaii State Constitution[,]” and (2)
 
whether the furlough constitutes “a mandatory subject of
 
collective bargaining negotiation . . . as prescribed by HRS §
 
89-9(a).” Although it appears that the HLRB lacks jurisdiction
 
to consider the constitutional issue, pertinent statutes reveal
 
that the HLRB has jurisdiction to “[r]esolve controversies under
 
[HRS chapter 89.]” HRS § 89-5(i)(3); see id. § 89-5(a); id. §
 
89-5(i)(4); see also HRS § 89-1(b)(3). As such, a constitutional
 
analysis is unnecessary for the HLRB to adjudicate the statutory
 
issues that are presented in HGEA’s first amended complaint. 
Instead, the HLRB’s analysis may be guided by rules of statutory
 
construction16 or any other rule it may deem to be appropriate. 
16 We point out that this court follows certain well-established
rules of statutory construction that are in addition to those rules quoted
supra in section II.B. Namely, it is well-established that, 
[w]hen construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language of the statute itself. And we must read statutory
language in the context of the entire statute and construe
(continued...)
 
22
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
For this reason, HGEA’s assertion is unpersuasive.17
 
In other words, if the HLRB determined that the
 
furlough plan constituted a valid exercise of Lingle’s management
 
rights under HRS § 89-9(d), then the circuit court would have
 
jurisdiction to determine whether the exercise of such a
 
statutory management right violates article XIII, section 2. 
However, if the HLRB reached the contrary conclusion and
 
determined that Lingle’s actions were not authorized under HRS
 
Chapter 89, then the circuit court would not need to reach the
 
constitutional issue.
 
Thus, the circuit court erred by reaching the
 
constitutional issue without first giving the HLRB the

it in a manner consistent with its purpose.

statute.

 However, we point out that, although not presented, there may be
certain circumstances where the circuit court may decide interim relief. For
 example, the circuit court can provide temporary relief in cases involving
alleged prohibited practices upon application by the HLRB. See infra note 20
 
and discussion on page 27.
 
23
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
opportunity to address the issues arising under HRS Chapter 89. 
As we noted in City & County of Honolulu v. Sherman, 110 Hawai' i 
39, 56 n.7, 129 P.3d 542, 559 n.7 (2006), “[a] fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts 
avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the 
necessity of deciding them.” (Citation omitted.) Moreover, 
requiring that statutory issues be submitted to the HLRB furthers 
the legislative policy, reflected in HRS § 89-14’s grant of 
“exclusive original jurisdiction,” of having the administrative 
agency with expertise in these matters decide them in the first 
instance. Stated differently, that legislative purpose is 
frustrated if the HLRB’s jurisdiction can be defeated by 
characterizing issues that fall within the scope of HRS Chapter 
89 as constitutional claims and then addressing them directly to 
the circuit court. 
Similar to HGEA’s assertions, Intervenors assert that
 
the HLRB’s jurisdiction “is limited to resolving claims of
 
prohibited practices under the labor relations statutes, not
 
constitutional violations, so the HLRB could not have decided the
 
constitutional claim.” In support of their assertion,
 
Intervenors rely on HRS § 89-14 by reading the statute in the
 
following way: “HLRB has jurisdiction over controversies
 
‘concerning prohibited practices . . . as provided in [HRS]
 
section 377-9[.]’” (Brackets added.) Intervenors then rely on
 
the following language in HRS § 377-9: “Any controversy
 
concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted to the board .
 
. . .” 
24
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
Through their reading of these statutes, Intervenors
 
apparently suggest that because alleged constitutional violations
 
are not included among the “prohibited practices . . . as
 
provided in [HRS] section 377-9,” jurisdiction over the
 
constitutional issue properly resided in the circuit court. 
Such was the reasoning and conclusion of the circuit court in
 
this case.18
 
However, we cannot say that HRS § 89-14’s reference to
 
HRS § 377-9 indicates any intent to distinguish between either
 
different types of prohibited practices, or a prohibited practice
 
on the one hand and constitutional violations on the other hand. 
Instead, our reading of HRS § 89-14 indicates that its reference
 
to HRS § 377-9 is made to merely point to a statute that
 
illustrates in what “manner” and “effect” a “controversy
 
18 In detail, the circuit court concluded that the instant case was
 
properly before the [c]ourt for issuance of injunctive and
declaratory relief, because the issue is whether [Lingle’s]
June 1, 2009 decision, and implementation of that decision
through Executive Order 09-02 (June 24, 2009), are a
violation of Article XIII, Section 2 of the Hawaii State
Constitution, just as the issue in Yogi was whether a
statute violated Article XIII, Section 2 of the Hawaii State
Constitution.
 
(Emphasis in original, brackets added.) As such, the circuit court
“reject[ed] [Lingle’s] contention that this case must be presented to the
[HLRB]” because “[t]he jurisdiction of the [HLRB] is limited.” (Brackets
added.) According to the court’s interpretation of HRS § 89-14, “‘the board
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction’ only over ‘[a] controversy
concerning prohibited practices . . . as provided in section 377-9.’ Section
 377-9, HRS, provides, in turn, that ‘[a]ny controversy involving unfair labor
practices may be submitted to the board.’ None of the prohibited practices in
Chapter 377 include constitutional violations.” (Emphases, brackets, and
ellipsis in original.) The circuit court also pointed out that “HRS § 89-13
addresses various prohibited practices that the HLRB is required to render
factual findings concerning whether or not a prohibited practice occurred.” 
25
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
concerning prohibited practices may be submitted to the [HLRB.]” 
See HRS § 89-14. Indeed, the portion of HRS § 89-14 that
 
Intervenors are referring to provides, in its entirety: “Any
 
controversy concerning prohibited practices may be submitted to
 
the board in the same manner and with the same effect as provided
 
in section 377-9 . . . .” (Emphasis added.) 
Among HRS § 377-9’s subsections that illustrate in what
 
“manner” and “effect” a “controversy concerning prohibited
 
practices may be submitted to the [HLRB]” is HRS § 377-9(b),
 
which provides in part that “[a]ny party in interest may file
 
with the board a written complaint, on a form provided by the
 
board, charging any person with having engaged in any specific
 
unfair labor practice.” Therefore, Intervenors’ assertion is
 
unpersuasive because HRS § 89-14’s reference to HRS § 377-9 does
 
not make the alleged distinction, and instead merely points to a
 
statute that illustrates in what “manner” and “effect” a
 
“controversy concerning prohibited practices may be submitted to
 
the [HLRB] . . . .”
 
HGEA also asserts that jurisdiction properly resided in
 
the circuit court in this case because the courts, and not the
 
HLRB, “may grant the preliminary injunctive relief sought by
 
HGEA.” According to HGEA, “[Lingle’s] oral announcement of
 
furloughs on June 1, 2009, and written executive order on June
 
24, 2009, to be implemented by July 1, 2010 [sic], provided only
 
a short time frame to act, thereby creating exigent
 
26
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
 
circumstances.”19
 
However, HGEA does not cite to any authority that
 
supports its position that, essentially, “exigent circumstances”
 
justified the circuit court in proceeding directly to the
 
constitutional issues without first allowing the HLRB to rule on
 
the statutory questions. Instead, HGEA admits that “HRS § 380­
14(b) provides that the [HLRB] shall have the power to petition
 
any circuit court for appropriate temporary relief or restraining
 
order[.]”20 (Brackets added.) Accordingly, viewing HRS § 380­
14(b) in light of HRS § 89-14, we remain mindful that “[p]rudential rules of judicial self-governance properly limit 
the role of the courts in a democratic society[,]” and one such 
rule is that, “even in the absence of constitutional 
restrictions, [courts] must still weigh the wisdom, efficacy, and 
timeliness of an exercise of their power before acting, 
especially where there may be an intrusion into areas committed 
to other branches of government.” In re Attorney’s Fees of Mohr, 
97 Hawai' i 1, 9-10, 32 P.3d 647, 655-56 (2001) (emphasis in 
19 We note that Intervenors assert a similar position as HGEA. 
20 HRS § 380-14(b) (1993) provides:
 
The board shall have power, upon the filing of a
complaint as provided in section 377-9 to petition any
circuit court of the State within any circuit wherein the
unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have
occurred or wherein the person resides or transacts
business, for appropriate temporary relief or restraining
order. Upon the filing of any such petition the court shall
cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and
thereupon shall have jurisdiction to grant to the board such
temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and
 proper.

marks and citation omitted); see Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co.

(Klein, J., concurring and dissenting) (“[T]he Court’s function in the application and interpretation of . . . laws must be 
carefully limited to avoid encroaching on the power of [the 
legislature] to determine policies and make laws to carry them

770, 398 U.S. 235, 256-57 (1970).) (Internal quotation marks 
omitted, brackets in original and added, and ellipsis added.)). 
The record in this case does not establish that recourse to the 
procedure set forth in HRS § 380-14(b) would be either futile or 
impractical, and it would be unwise for us to bring about a 
policy that effectively circumscribes HLRB’s exclusive original 
jurisdiction over “[a]ny controversy concerning prohibited 
practices[,]” as mandated by the legislature in HRS § 89-14. As 
such, HGEA’s assertion is unpersuasive on the present record. 
In light of the foregoing, we hold that the HLRB had 
exclusive original jurisdiction over the statutory issues raised 
in HGEA’s complaint, and the circuit court erred in addressing 
the constitutional issues without first giving the HLRB the 
opportunity to address the statutory questions.

 further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
