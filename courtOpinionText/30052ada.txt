OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
In this case, we apply Hawaii Government Employees
 
Ass’n, AFSCME Local 152, AFL-CIO v. Lingle (hereinafter “HGEA”),
 
124 Hawai' i 197, 239 P.3d 1 (2010), and hold that the circuit 
court erred by deciding statutory issues over which the Hawai' i 
Labor Relations Board (“HLRB”) has exclusive original 
jurisdiction. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Briefly stated, in order to reduce labor costs, then-
Governor Linda Lingle (“Lingle”) announced her decision to
 
3
furlough all state employees for three days per month and to
restrict spending in the Department of Education (“DOE”) and
 
University of Hawai
'i (“University”) in an equal amount. She 
later filed executive order 09-02, which unilaterally imposed the 
three-day-per-month furloughs and reduced the DOE’s and the University’s funding accordingly. In response to executive order 09-02, Hawai' i State Teachers Association and United Public 
Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO (collectively, “plaintiffs”) brought the instant action, alleging that the furlough plan violated: (1) the right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining under article XIII, section 2 of the 
3
 Executive order 09-02 defined the term “furlough” as “the
 
placement of an employee temporarily and involuntarily in a non-pay and non-
duty status by the Employer because of lack of work or funds, or other non-
disciplinary reasons.”

Hawai'i Constitution;  (2) the employees’ right to accrued
retirement benefits under article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i 
5
Constitution;  and (3) separation of powers under article III,
section 1 of the Hawai' i Constitution.6 The plaintiffs moved for 
a temporary restraining order, which the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (“circuit court”) granted in part on August 28, 2009. Lingle asserted in part that the HLRB had exclusive jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims under chapter 89 of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS). The circuit court rejected this 
argument. The circuit court issued its First Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on August 28, 2009, which made the following relevant determinations: (1) the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their article XIII, section 2 claim because Lingle’s furlough order concerned a “core subject of collective bargaining”; (2) under the unilateral change doctrine, “the employer cannot implement unilateral changes regarding matters that are mandatory subjects of bargaining . . .”; (3) the HLRB 
4 Article XIII, section 2 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides that 
“[p]ersons in public employment shall have the right to organize for the
purpose of collective bargaining as provided by law.” 
5
 Article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides that 
“[m]embership in any employees’ retirement system of the State or anypolitical subdivision thereof shall be a contractual relationship, the accruedbenefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired.” 
6
 Article III, section 1 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides that 
the “legislative power of the State shall be vested in a legislature, whichshall consist of two houses, a senate and a house of representatives. Such power shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistentwith this constitution or the Constitution of the United States.”

        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claims;
 
(4) United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Hanneman, 106 Hawai' i 359, 105 P.3d 236 (2005), is inapposite; 
and (5) the management rights enumerated in HRS § 89-9(d) (Supp. 2008) did not allow Lingle’s unilateral imposition of the furloughs. The circuit court filed its final judgment on September 10, 2009. The circuit court subsequently filed an amended judgment on September 24, 2009. 
The plaintiffs appealed on September 10, 2009,
 
asserting that the circuit court erred by: (1) determining “that
 HRS § 37-37(a) [wa]s a constitutional delegation of budget-
reduction authority to the Governor”; and (2) “dismissing Count
 III of the First Amended Complaint sua sponte, without providing
 [the plaintiffs] with an opportunity to respond.”
7 Lingle cross-
appealed, asserting in part that the circuit court lacked
 jurisdiction to determine whether the furlough plan complied with
 HRS § 89-9(d).
 
The plaintiffs applied for transfer from the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) to this court of their
 appeal and Lingle’s cross-appeal. On December 1, 2009, this
 court entered an order granting the plaintiffs’ application for
 transfer pursuant to HRS § 602-58(a)(1) (Supp. 2008).
 
7
 In light of our conclusion that the circuit court lacked subject
 
matter jurisdiction, it is unnecessary to address these issues.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
“Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction
 
is a question of law reviewable de novo.” HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 
201, 239 P.3d at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting
 
Hawaii Mgmt. Alliance Ass’n v. Ins. Comm’r, 106 Hawai' i 21, 27, 
100 P.3d 952, 957 (2004)).
 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of
 
law reviewable de novo. Id. This court follows the following
 
principles when interpreting statutes:
 
First,  the  fundamental  starting  point  for  statutory
interpretation  is  the  language  of  the  statute  itself.
Second,  where  the  statutory  language  is  plain  and
unambiguous,  our  sole  duty  is  to  give  effect  to  its  plain
and  obvious  meaning.  Third,  implicit  in  the  task  of
statutory  construction  is  our  foremost  obligation  to
ascertain  and  give  effect  to  the  intention  of  the
legislature,  which  is  to  be  obtained  primarily  from  the
language  contained  in  the  statute  itself.  Fourth,  when  there
is  doubt,  doubleness  of  meaning,  or  indistinctiveness  or
uncertainty  of  an  expression  used  in  a  statute,  an  ambiguity
exists.  And  fifth,  in  construing  an  ambiguous  statute,  the
meaning  of  the  ambiguous  words  may  be  sought  by  examining
the  context,  with  which  the  ambiguous  words,  phrases,  and
sentences  may  be  compared,  in  order  to  ascertain  their  true
meaning.
 
Id. at 202, 239 P.3d at 6.
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The circuit court determined that it had subject matter
 
jurisdiction over the dispute. The circuit court further
 
determined that the management rights enumerated in HRS § 89-9(d)
 did not allow Lingle to unilaterally furlough employees.
 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Lingle asserts that the circuit court erred because it
 
did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute. In
 
response, the plaintiffs assert that: (1) the doctrines of
 exhaustion of administrative remedies and primary jurisdiction
 are matters of policy; and (2) the unique circumstances of this
 case weigh against requiring the case to proceed before the HLRB. 
In HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 200, 239 P.3d at 4, this court 
held that the HLRB had “exclusive original jurisdiction” over the HRS chapter 89 issues raised by the plaintiffs and that “the circuit court should have deferred ruling on the constitutional issues until after the HLRB had the opportunity to resolve the statutory questions.” In HGEA, the plaintiffs asserted in their complaint that “‘[t]he Governor does not have the implied right to unilaterally impose furloughs pursuant to HRS § 89-9(d)’ thereby ‘circumvent[ing] the collective bargaining process’ because ‘[f]urloughs reduce employee hours and wages and affect terms and conditions of employment and, therefore, are a mandatory subject of collective bargaining negotiation protected by Article XIII, Section 2 of the Hawaii State Constitution and as prescribed by HRS § 89-9(a).’” Id. at 205, 239 P.3d at 9 
(emphases added). The plaintiffs in this case did not make similar allegations with respect to their article XIII, section 2

claim.8 Because the plaintiffs in the instant case did not raise
 
statutory issues in their complaint, this case presents the
 
question of whether the reasoning in HGEA applies when the
 plaintiffs raise constitutional issues while omitting references
 to statutory issues the HLRB has exclusive jurisdiction over. We
 hold that it does, and therefore vacate the circuit court’s
 judgment and remand to the circuit court.
 
In HGEA, HGEA based its request for relief on both 
statutory and constitutional grounds. HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 200, 
239 P.3d at 4. The circuit court granted a preliminary injunction partly on the grounds that: (1) the HLRB did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute; (2) Lingle’s decision to unilaterally furlough employees violated article XIII, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution; (3) under NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S. 736 
(1962), Lingle could not impose furloughs by unilateral action; (4) United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Hanneman, 106 Hawai' i 359, 105 P.3d 236 (2005), is “inapposite”; 
and (5) Lingle’s reliance on HRS § 89-9(d) to justify the furloughs was not persuasive. HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 201, 239 P.3d 
at 5. This court held that HRS § 89-14 (1993) provided the HLRB 
8
 The plaintiffs did assert that the “obligation to pay wages and
 
salaries to bargaining units 1, 5 and 10, on and after June 1, 2009 and to
maintain hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment are valid
obligations and commitments previously incurred: . . . [b]y statute under
chapter 89 which prohibits any unilateral changes in wages, hours of work, and
other terms and conditions of employment absent good faith bargaining leading
to impasse (which has yet to occur).” However, this assertion occurred in the
context of their claim regarding separation of powers.

with exclusive original jurisdiction over the dispute.
 
HRS § 89-14 provides that “[a]ny controversy concerning
 
prohibited practices may be submitted to the board in the same
 
manner and with the same effect as provided in section 377-9;
 provided that the board shall have exclusive original
 jurisdiction over such a controversy . . . .” (Emphasis added.) 
This court observed that HRS § 89-13(a) defines the term
 prohibited practice as follows:
 
It shall be a prohibited practice for a public
employer or its designated representative wilfully to:
 
. . . .
 
(5) Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with
the exclusive representative as required in section 89-9;
 
(6) Refuse to participate in good faith in the
mediation and arbitration procedures set forth in section
89-11;
 
(7) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of
this chapter;
 
(8) Violate the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement.
 
HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 204, 239 P.3d at 8 (quoting HRS § 89-13(a) 
(Supp. 2003)). 
This court held that “[v]iewing the assertions made by
 
HGEA in its first amended complaint in light of HRS § 89-13(a),
 
it appears that HGEA alleges that Lingle essentially engaged in a
 ‘prohibited practice’ when she unilaterally imposed furloughs.” 
Id. at 205, 239 P.3d at 9. Therefore, this court held that “the
 HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction over the statutory
 claims raised in HGEA’s complaint.” Id. at 206, 239 P.3d at 10. 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Unlike the plaintiffs in HGEA, the plaintiffs here have 
not referred to HRS chapter 89 in their complaint when arguing 
that the imposition of furloughs violated article XIII, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution. Nevertheless, HGEA applies. This 
is apparent from the text of HRS § 89-14 and the policies enumerated in HGEA. 
The plain language of HRS § 89-14 supports concluding 
that the instant case is a “controversy concerning prohibited practices” that must first be submitted to the HLRB. Although the term “controversy concerning prohibited practices” is not defined by chapter 89, this court “may resort to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one way to determine the ordinary meaning of certain terms not statutorily defined.” Nuuanu Valley 
Ass’n v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai' i 90, 98, 194 P.3d 
531, 539 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals, 109 Hawai' i 384, 393, 126 P.3d 1071, 
1080 (2006)). The term “concerning” is defined as “relating to.” Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary 423 (2d ed. 2001). The term “prohibited practice” is defined in HRS § 89-13 in part as “[r]efus[ing] to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative as required in section 89-9[,]” “[r]efus[ing] to participate in good faith in the mediation and arbitration procedures set forth in section 89-11[,]” refusing to comply with any provision of chapter 89, and “[v]iolat[ing] the 
9
          
       
          
           
           
         
          
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
terms of a collective bargaining agreement.” HRS § 89-13(a)(5)­
(8). The plaintiffs’ first amended complaint asserts that Lingle violated article XIII, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution by 
imposing a unilateral reduction in wages, prohibiting negotiations regarding the furloughs, and by unilaterally suspending the “collective bargaining process as provided by law” for two years. The plaintiffs’ complaint states claims relating to “prohibited practices” because it ultimately challenges Lingle’s ability to unilaterally impose furloughs without collectively bargaining. See HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 205, 239 P.3d 
at 9 (holding that “HGEA alleges that Lingle essentially engaged in a ‘prohibited practice’ when she unilaterally imposed furloughs[,]” because HGEA asserted that “[t]he Governor does not have the implied right to unilaterally impose furloughs pursuant to HRS § 89-9(d)” thereby “circumvent[ing] the collective bargaining process . . .”). Deleting references to chapter 89 does not change the fact that the dispute ultimately relates to a prohibited practice. Therefore, the plain language of HRS § 89­14 indicates that the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims.
9
 
9
 For the same reason, the plaintiffs’ argument that “the HLRB’s
 
original jurisdiction is limited to resolving controversies concerning
prohibited practices” and that a circuit court “has jurisdiction to interpret
Chapter 89 in the first instance when statutory interpretation is necessary to
resolve a claim within the Circuit Court’s jurisdiction” is unpersuasive. The
 plaintiffs’ argument is correct in controversies that do not concern
prohibited practices; however, the instant case is a controversy concerning a
prohibited practice over which the HLRB has exclusive original jurisdiction.
 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
This analysis is bolstered by this court’s opinion in 
HGEA, where we rejected the plaintiffs’ attempt to characterize 
their statutory claim as a constitutional claim. HGEA, 124 
Hawai'i at 208, 239 P.3d at 12. This court held that the 
legislative purpose of “having the administrative agency with expertise in these matters decide them in the first instance” is “frustrated if the HLRB’s jurisdiction can be defeated by characterizing issues that fall within the scope of HRS Chapter 89 as constitutional claims and then addressing them directly to the circuit court.” Id. Likewise, even though HSTA has not 
brought a chapter 89 claim against Lingle, the legislative purpose of providing the HLRB with exclusive original jurisdiction over chapter 89 complaints is frustrated if plaintiffs can recast their statutory claims as constitutional claims and proceed directly to circuit court. Thus, the circuit court erred by failing allow the HLRB to decide the issues relating to chapter 89 before deciding the constitutional issues. 
The plaintiffs also assert that the case did not need 
to proceed before the HLRB because this case involved a “fiscal crisis” and an “urgent need for resolution” of an issue “affecting all State employees.” However, that argument was rejected in HGEA. HGEA, 124 Hawai' i at 209, 239 P.3d at 13 
(“HGEA does not cite to any authority that supports its position that, essentially, ‘exigent circumstances’ justified the circuit

court in proceeding directly to the constitutional issues without
 
first allowing the HLRB to rule on the statutory questions.”).10
 
Therefore, the HLRB had exclusive original jurisdiction over the
 dispute.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit
 
court’s September 24, 2009 amended judgment and remand for
 further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 Similarly, a number of the plaintiffs’ other arguments were 
rejected in HGEA. For instance, the plaintiffs assert that: (1) exhaustion
of administrative remedies does not apply because proceedings in the circuit
court would have been necessary to obtain a temporary restraining order, see
HRS § 377-9(d) (1993); and (2) the HLRB does not have jurisdiction to resolvethe plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. In HGEA, this court rejected those 
arguments. See HGEA , 124 Hawai 'i at 208-09, 239 P.3d at 12-13.
