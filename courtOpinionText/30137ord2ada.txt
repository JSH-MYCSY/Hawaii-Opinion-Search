GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner-Appellant,
vs.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee.
                                                                 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(SPP NO. 09-1-0021 (CR. NO. 96-0078))
ORDER
(By: Duffy, J. for the court1)
Upon consideration of movant Gerald Villanueva’s motion
to remand for resentencing or issuance of a writ of habeas
corpus, it appears that this case is not within the jurisdiction
of the supreme court, but is within the jurisdiction of the
intermediate court of appeals.  See HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2009). 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to remand is
dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 24, 2010.
FOR THE COURT:
Associate Justice
