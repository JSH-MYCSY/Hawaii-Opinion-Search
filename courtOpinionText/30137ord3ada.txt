GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner-Appellant,
vs.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee.
                                                                 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(SPP NO. 09-1-0021 (CR. NO. 96-0078))
ORDER
(By: Duffy, J. for the court1)
Upon consideration of movant Gerald Villanueva’s 
“motion to grant the common law writ of habeas corpus,” which is
deemed filed on March 18, 2010 and which is treated as a motion
for reconsideration of this court’s February 4, 2010 order
denying movant’s February 1, 2010 “motion to the supreme court to
issue writ of habeas corpus,” it appears that the motion for
reconsideration is untimely.  See HRAP 40(a) (“A motion for
reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days after
the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling unless
by special leave additional time is granted during such period by
a judge or justice of the appellate court involved.”). 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
reconsideration is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 7, 2010.
FOR THE COURT:
Associate Justice
