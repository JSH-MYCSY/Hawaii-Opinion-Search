GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner-Appellant,
vs.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee.
                                                                 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(SPP No. 09-1-0021 (CR. NO. 96-0078))
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of movant Gerald Villanueva’s
“motion to the supreme court to issue writ of habeas corpus”
filed on February 1, 2010, it appears that this case is not
within the jurisdiction of the supreme court, but is within the
jurisdiction of the intermediate court of appeals.  See HRS §
602-57(1) (Supp. 2009).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to issue writ of
habeas corpus is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 4, 2010.
