IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
NORDIC CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD., 
Respondent/Lienor-Appellee,
vs.
MAUI BEACH RESORT LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, 
a Foreign Limited Partnership, 
Petitioner/Respondent-Appellant.
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
(M.L. NO. 08-1-0017)
ORDER ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
AND AFFIRMING ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTI0N
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Petitioner/respondent-appellant Maui Beach Resort
Limited Partnership (Maui Beach Resort), by application filed on
March 9, 2010, timely applies for a writ of certiorari to review
the Intermediate Court of Appeals's (ICA) March 4, 2010 order
granting respondent/lienor-appellee Nordic Construction Co.,
Ltd.’s (Nordic) January 11, 2010 motion to dismiss Maui Beach
Resort’s appeal from the first circuit court’s October 26, 2009
order denying, without prejudice, Maui Beach Resort’s motion to
discharge surety bond.  The ICA granted the January 11, 2010
motion and dismissed Maui Beach Resort’s appeal for the reason
that the October 26, 2009 order was not reduced to a separate
judgment in accordance with HRCP 58 and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994).  2For the reasons set forth below, we accept the
application for a writ of certiorari and affirm the ICA’s March
4, 2010 dismissal order, but for the reason that the October 26,
2009 order is not an appealable final order.
i.
Mechanic’s lien action M.L. No. 08-1-0017 was commenced
in the second circuit court on August 8, 2008 by the filing of an
application for lien pursuant to HRS § 507-43 (2006).  The
application was dismissed on December 30, 2008 upon the posting
of bond on December 2, 2008 pursuant to HRS § 507-45 (2006).  A
motion to discharge the bond was filed on September 3, 2009.  The
motion was denied without prejudice by order of October 26, 2009
for the reason that the dispute for which the bond was posted had
yet to be resolved, such that the request to discharge the bond
was premature.
The October 26, 2009 order was immediately appealed by
Maui Beach Resort.  Appellee Nordic, by motion filed on January
11, 2010, moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, asserting that the October 26, 2009 order was not
appealable because: (1) the order was not reduced to a separate
judgment in accordance with HRCP 58 and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
Fleming & Wright, supra, or alternatively; (2) the order was not
a final order that resolved the matter of whether the bond should
be discharged.
The ICA granted the January 11, 2010 motion to dismiss
and dismissed Maui Beach Resort’s appeal for lack of appellate3jurisdiction.  The ICA’s order of dismissal, filed on March 4,
2010, stated in relevant part that “the circuit court has not yet
reduced [the October 26, 2009 order] to a separate judgment, as
HRCP Rule 58 requires.  Absent an appealable separate judgment,
Appellant Maui Beach Resort’s appeal is premature, and we lack
appellate jurisdiction.”
ii.
“Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all
final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate court[.]” 
HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2009).  “‘Final order’ means an order
ending the proceedings, leaving further to be accomplished. 
Consequently, an order is not final if the rights of a party
involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for
further action.”  Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Central Pacific
Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937
(1986).
The August 8, 2008 application for lien filed as M.L.
No. 08-1-0017 was finally determined by the December 30, 2008
order dismissing the application.  The September 3, 2009 motion
to discharge the bond was a post-judgment proceeding in M.L. No.
08-1-0017.  The October 26, 2009 order denying the motion for
discharge without prejudice, until resolution of the dispute for
which the bond was posted, did not finally determine Maui Beach
Resort’s right to have the bond discharged.  Consequently, the
October 26, 2009 order was not a final order appealable pursuant4to HRS § 641-1(a), and the ICA should have granted the January
11, 2010 motion to dismiss for this reason.  A final order, when
entered, is not subject to the separate judgment rule of HRCP 58
and Jenkins.  See Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai #i 153, 159, 80 P.3d
974, 980 (2003) (“Clearly, the rule in Jenkins . . . is limited
to circuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a circuit
court complaint.”) (original underscoring).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
certiorari is accepted.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the March 4, 2010 order of
the ICA granting the January 11, 2010 motion to dismiss appeal
for lack of appellate jurisdiction is affirmed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 8, 2010.
