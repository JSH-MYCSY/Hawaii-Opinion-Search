OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
In this appeal, we consider whether the Intermediate
 
Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review a good faith
 
settlement determination, which was made by a federal bankruptcy
 court prior to the case being remanded to state court. 
Eadean Michie Buffington seeks review of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ June 4, 2010 order dismissing
 
1
Buffington and Integrity Escrow and Title Company, Inc.’s  appeal
for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Buffington and Integrity appealed pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised Statutes § 663-15.5(e) 
(Supp. 2009), quoted infra, from an order entered by the federal bankruptcy court determining that a settlement of tort claims was made in good faith. They filed their notices of appeal in the circuit court, after the case had been remanded to that court. The Intermediate Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction for three reasons: (1) one of the defendants in the tort action was in bankruptcy; (2) the bankruptcy court’s good faith settlement order was not in the record on appeal; and (3) Hawai
'i Revised Statutes §§ 602-57 and 
663-15.5(e) do not authorize an appeal to a Hawai 'i appellate

 During the pendency of this case, Integrity Escrow and Title
Company, Inc., formerly known as First Financial Title and Escrow Agency of
Hawaii, Inc., merged into Hawaii Escrow & Title, Inc. and is now identified as
“Hawaii Escrow & Title, Inc., formerly known as Integrity Escrow and Title
Company, Inc., formerly known as First Financial Title and Escrow Agency of
Hawaii, Inc.” However, for ease of reference, the company will be identified
here as Integrity. As discussed further infra, Integrity is no longer a party
 to this appeal.

court from a good faith settlement determination made by a
 
federal court. 
For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals had jurisdiction. Accordingly, we
 vacate the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ dismissal order and
 remand to the Intermediate Court of Appeals for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion.
 
I. Background
 
A. Factual and procedural background
 
The following facts are taken from the record on appeal 
(ROA), which includes all documents filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) before the case was removed to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawai
'i 
(bankruptcy court), including the third amended complaint, and documents filed in circuit court after the case was remanded, discussed further infra.
2 
On September 23, 2005, the Walter Y.C. Chang Trust,
 
Walter Y.C. Chang, and Sylvia S.W. Chang (collectively the
 Changs) filed a Complaint for Foreclosure and Other Relief in
 Civil No. 05-1-1708 (the foreclosure action) in circuit court. 
2
 The record on appeal does not contain all of the documents filed
in the bankruptcy court. For example, the record on appeal only contains the
complaint and the first, second, and third amended complaints. However, the
appellate record includes a motion to modify the record on appeal, attached to
which was a fifth amended complaint that appears to have been filed in the
bankruptcy court while the case was removed. That motion was denied as moot
 by the Intermediate Court of Appeals on June 8, 2010. Nevertheless, the
record on appeal contains sufficient information for this court to review the
jurisdictional question presented on appeal. 
-3­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Changs filed their first, second, and third amended
 
complaints in the circuit court. According to the third amended
 complaint, the subject of the foreclosure action was a Middle
 Street apartment building that the Changs sold in 2003 to Steve
 Crouch and Naomi Crouch (the Crouches). The sale was by way of a
 purchase money mortgage executed by Hokulani Square, Inc., a
 corporation of which the Crouches were the only directors,
 officers, and shareholders. Hokulani Square subsequently
 mortgaged the Middle Street building to secure a $1.9 million
 loan from Investors Funding Corporation (Investors Funding) and
 purchased commercial property on School Street. Investors
 Funding’s mortgage on the Middle Street property was elevated
 over the Changs’ purchase money mortgage on the property via a
 subordination agreement that the Crouches allegedly secured from
 the Changs. 
The Changs’ third amended complaint alleged, inter
 
alia, that the Crouches and Hokulani Square were in default of
 the purchase money mortgage. The third amended complaint further
 alleged that the sale of the Middle Street building and the
 execution of the subordination agreement were the result of undue
 influence and/or fraud, and a breach of fiduciary duty by the
 Changs’ attorney, Eadean Buffington (Buffington). The complaint
 sought, inter alia, prioritizing of the Changs’ claims to the
 Middle Street and School Street properties, an equitable lien on
 the Middle and School Street properties, and damages against the
 
-4­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Crouches, Hokulani Square, and Buffington. 
On May 10, 2007, Hokulani Square filed a petition for
 
bankruptcy in bankruptcy court. On October 11, 2007, Hokulani
 
Square removed the Changs’ circuit court action to the bankruptcy
 court as an adversary proceeding.
3 In the adversary proceeding,
 
Integrity was added as a third party defendant. 
B. The good faith settlement determination 
On July 21, 2009, in the adversary proceeding, the
 
Changs filed a notice of settlement with Investors Funding, among
 
other parties, and petitioned the bankruptcy court for a
 determination, pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
4
§ 663—15.5(b),  that the settlement was made in good faith.  The
 
3 “The adversary proceeding is the bankruptcy analog of the civil
action. It is a separate and distinct litigation connected with the
bankruptcy case and has a separate docket number on the adversary proceeding
docket.” John Silas (“Si”) Hopkins, III, Adversary Proceedings in Bankruptcy,
39 No. 6 Prac. Law. 8, 55 (Sept. 1993).
4 HRS § 663-15.5 (Supp. 2009) provides, in relevant part:
 
Release; joint tortfeasors; co-obligors; good faith
settlement
 
(a) A release, dismissal with or without prejudice, or
a covenant not to sue or not to enforce a judgment
that is given in good faith under subsection (b) to
one or more joint tortfeasors, or to one or more
co-obligors who are mutually subject to contribution
rights, shall:
 
(1) Not discharge any other joint tortfeasor or
co-obligor not released from liability unless
its terms so provide;
 
(2) Reduce the claims against the other joint
tortfeasor or co-obligor not released in the
amount stipulated by the release, dismissal, or
covenant, or in the amount of the consideration
paid for it, whichever is greater; and
 
(continued...)
 
-5­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
bankruptcy court issued an order on December 2, 2009 granting the
 
Changs’ petition pursuant to HRS § 663-15.5.5 The order stated
 
in relevant part:
 
This order does not decide whether the Uniform
 
Contribution among Tortfeasors Act [HRS] § 663-11­
663.17 [sic]) applies to any of the claims in this
 case. This order does decide, however, that the
settlement was made in good faith within the meaning
of [HRS] § 663-15.5.
 
C. Appeal and remand to circuit court
 
On December 10, 2009, pursuant to HRS § 663-15.5(e),6
 
4(...continued)
(3) Discharge the party to whom it is given from
all liability for any contribution to any other
joint tortfeasor or co-obligor. 
This subsection shall not apply to co-obligors who
have expressly agreed in writing to an apportionment
of liability for losses or claims among themselves.
 
(b) For purposes of subsection (a), any party shall
petition the court for a hearing on the issue of good
faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or
other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors or
co-obligors, serving notice to all other known joint
tortfeasors or co-obligors. Upon a showing of good
cause, the court may shorten the time for giving the
required notice to permit the determination of the
issue before the commencement of the trial of the
 action, or before the verdict or judgment if
settlement is made after the trial has commenced. 
5 HRS § 663-15.5(c) (Supp. 2009) provides:
 
The court may determine the issue of good faith
for purposes of subsection (a) on the basis of
affidavits or declarations served with the petition
under subsection (a), and any affidavits or
declarations filed in response. In the alternative,
the court, in its discretion, may receive other
evidence at a hearing.
 
6
 HRS § 663-15.5(e) (Supp. 2009) provides:
 
A party aggrieved by a court determination on
the issue of good faith may appeal the determination.
The appeal shall be filed within twenty days after
service of written notice of the determination, or
within any additional time not exceeding twenty days
(continued...)
 
-6­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Buffington and Integrity appealed the bankruptcy court’s
 
December 2, 2009 good faith settlement determination in the
 adversary proceeding. Buffington and Integrity also filed
 statements electing to have their appeals heard by the United
 States District Court for the District of Hawai
'i (district 
court).7
 
On December 16, 2009, while the appeal to the district
 
court was pending, the bankruptcy court filed its Order Remanding
 Adversary Proceeding to State Court. The bankruptcy court’s
 order remanding the adversary proceeding provided:
 
On October 11, 2007, Debtor Hokulani Square,
Inc., removed this action, Civil No. 05-1-1708-09,
from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, State of
[8]
Hawaii, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1452(a).  On
 
April 13, 2009, the court entered an Order Regarding
Remand of This Adversary Proceeding, setting a
deadline of May 15, 2009, for a party to file a motion
to withdraw reference of this matter to the district
 court in order to conduct a jury trial. 
The order
 
further provided for remand of the action to the state
court absent the filing of such a motion. The
 original deadline was most recently extended to
December 15, 2009. No timely motion to withdraw
reference has been filed.
 
6(...continued)
as the court may allow.
 
7 28 U.S.C. § 158 (2005) authorizes appeals from judgments, orders,
or decrees of a bankruptcy court to: (1) a district court, (2) a bankruptcy
appellate panel, or (3) a court of appeals.
 
8
 28 U.S.C. § 1452(a) (1990) provides:
 
A party may remove any claim or cause of action
in a civil action other than a proceeding before the
United States Tax Court or a civil action by a
governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit's
police or regulatory power, to the district court for
the district where such civil action is pending, if
such district court has jurisdiction of such claim or
cause of action under section 1334 of this title.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this
adversary proceeding is remanded to the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit, State of Hawaii, pursuant to 28
[9]
U.S.C. § 1452(b).  The clerk shall forthwith
 
transmit a certified copy of this order together with
a copy of the docket sheet of this adversary
proceeding to the clerk of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit. The parties shall be responsible for
providing copies of any process and pleadings to the
state court.
 
This order does not determine the effect of the
 
remand on the pending appeals of the Order Granting
Plaintiffs’ Petition for Determination of Good Faith
 Settlement Pursuant to [HRS] § 663-15.5 Filed on July
21, 2009 (“Good Faith Order”), entered December 2,
2009. Notwithstanding the remand, the clerk shall
accept for filing in this adversary proceeding
documents necessary to perfect the appeals, such as a
designation of items to be included in the record on
appeal and a statement of issues to be presented.
[ 10
]
On December 22, 2009, Buffington and Integrity each
 
filed, in the circuit court, notices of appeal to the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), pursuant to HRS § 663­15.5(e), from the bankruptcy court’s December 2, 2009 good faith
 settlement determination. 
On December 31, 2009, the bankruptcy court sent the
 
following four documents to the circuit court: (1) a certified
 copy of the bankruptcy court’s December 16, 2009 remand order;
 
9 28 U.S.C. § 1452(b) (1990) provides:
 
The court to which such claim or cause of action
 
is removed may remand such claim or cause of action on
any equitable ground. An order entered under this
subsection remanding a claim or cause of action, or a
decision to not remand, is not reviewable by appeal or
otherwise by the court of appeals under section
158(d), 1291, or 1292 of this title or by the Supreme
Court of the United States under section 1254 of this
 title.
 
10
 As discussed further infra in note 17, federal cases indicate that
 
the district court did not retain jurisdiction to consider Buffington’s and
Integrity’s appeals.
 
-8­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(2) a Notice of Remand advising the circuit court that the
 
bankruptcy court “maintains the official record of its cases and
 proceedings in electronic format[]” and “[t]herefore, no case
 file with paper documents is available for transmission with this
 notice[,]” but that “[a] complete set of the documents in this
 action may be accessed through the Federal Judiciary’s
 centralized electronic records center on the Internet, Public
 Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) at
 http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov[;]” (3) a copy of the docket sheet
 of the adversary proceeding; and (4) a certified copy of the
 December 2, 2009 good faith settlement determination. The
 circuit court filed these four documents in the record of the
 foreclosure action (i.e., Civil No. 05-1-1708) on December 31,
 2009. 
On February 22, 2010, the circuit court record from the
 
foreclosure action, including the four documents transmitted from
 bankruptcy court, was transmitted to the ICA as the ROA. 
On April 21, 2010, Buffington and Integrity moved the
 
ICA to “modify” the ROA to include paper copies of 35 documents
 filed in the adversary proceeding, including the December 2, 2009
 good faith settlement determination.
11 The Changs filed a
 
Statement of No Opposition to the motion. 
11
 As noted above, the bankruptcy court maintained the official
record of the adversary proceeding in electronic format and did not transmit
paper copies to the circuit court on December 31, 2009. However, the
bankruptcy court’s December 31, 2009 letter did include a paper copy of the
good faith settlement determination. 
-9­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
D. The ICA’s decision
 
In its June 4, 2010 Order Dismissing Appeal, the ICA 
dismissed Buffington and Integrity’s appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. First, the ICA – upon noting that Hokulani Square’s bankruptcy case was still pending in the bankruptcy court – ruled that “[u]nder the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) [Rule 54(c)], when a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding is also a party in a state court case, ‘the appellate court shall not consider motions or requests for relief during the pendency of the bankruptcy.’” (Internal brackets omitted). Second, the ICA found that “the record on appeal . . . does not contain either the original copy or a certified photocopy of the December 2, 2009 United States Bankruptcy Court[‘s good faith settlement] order.” Third, the ICA held that even if the December 2, 2009 good faith settlement determination was in the record on appeal, the order was not appealable to the ICA because: (1) 28 U.S.C. § 158 authorizes appeals from a bankruptcy court order to a federal district court, a federal bankruptcy appellate panel, or a federal court of appeals and does not authorize an appeal to a state appellate court; and (2) “it is reasonable to infer from the plain language of HRS § 602-57
[12] 
12
 HRS § 602-57 (Supp. 2009) provides, in relevant part:
 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,
the intermediate appellate court shall have
jurisdiction, subject to transfer as provided in
section 602-58 or review on application for a writ of
certiorari as provided in section 602-59:
 
(continued...)
 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and HRS § 663-15.5(e) that the word ‘court’ refers to only 
Hawai'i state courts, and does not refer to a United States 
Bankruptcy Court.” 
On June 8, 2010, the ICA denied Buffington and
 
Integrity’s April 21, 2010 Joint Motion to Modify the Record on
 Appeal as moot. 
E. Motion for reconsideration of the ICA’s decision
 
On June 14, 2010, Buffington and Integrity moved for
 
reconsideration of the ICA’s dismissal order because the order
 
was “based on an incorrect assumption regarding the status of the
 case in regards to bankruptcy proceedings, and [] was incorrect
 regarding the [c]ourt’s jurisdiction.” Buffington and Integrity
 also noted that the ICA “did not have a complete record to review
 [because t]he record in this case does not yet contain any of the
 substantive filings made in the [a]dversary [p]roceeding in
 relation to the appeal issues.” (Footnote omitted). Regarding
 the pendency of Hokulani’s bankruptcy case, Buffington and
 Integrity asserted that “all cross-claims against Hokulani were
 obviated” through a separate settlement agreement, which was
 determined to be in good faith. Accordingly, Buffington and
 Integrity argued that “Hokulani has nothing to gain or lose in
 
12(...continued)
(1) To hear and determine appeals from
any court or agency when appeals are allowed by
law[.]
 
(Emphasis added). 
-11­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
this action[,]” and “[Hokulani’s] pending bankruptcy should not
 
impede Buffington and Integrity’s appeals.” Regarding the ICA’s
 interpretation of HRS § 663-15.5, Buffington and Integrity argued
 that “it is not reasonable to infer that the word ‘court’ in [HRS
 §] 663-15.5(e) refers only to Hawaii state courts [because s]uch
 an inference would effectively deprive Integrity and Buffington
 of their legislatively mandated appeal rights.” They also argued
 that because the adversary proceeding had been remanded, “the
 [b]ankruptcy [c]ourt no longer has jurisdiction over this case
 and has no power to reconsider the Good Faith Settlement Order. 
It is the Hawaii state courts that now have jurisdiction over the
 case.” 
The ICA denied the motion for reconsideration on
 
June 21, 2010. 
F. The application for writ of certiorari
 
On September 2, 2010, Buffington and Integrity timely
 
filed a joint application for a writ of certiorari to review the
 
ICA’s June 4, 2010 dismissal order, June 8, 2010 order denying
 the motion to modify the record, and the June 21, 2010 order
 denying the motion for reconsideration. The Changs did not file
 a response to the application. This court issued an order
 accepting the application for certiorari on October 20, 2010. On
 April 27, 2011, Integrity filed a stipulation to dismiss its
 appeal. This court issued an order approving the dismissal on
 May 5, 2011. The stipulation provided that the dismissal of
 
-12­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Integrity did not affect Buffington’s appeal. 
II. Standard of Review
 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that [the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong 
standard.” Captain Andy’s Sailing, Inc., v. Dep’t of Land & 
Natural Res., 113 Hawai 'i 184, 192, 150 P.3d 833, 841 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
III. Discussion
 
Buffington challenges the three bases for the ICA’s
 
dismissal of her appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. For
 the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the ICA erred on
 each of these grounds and that the ICA had jurisdiction over the
 appeal. 
A. HRAP Rule 54(c) did not deprive the ICA of jurisdiction
 
Buffington argues that the ICA incorrectly applied HRAP 
Rule 54(c) to the instant appeal. HRAP Rule 54(c) states that 
“[t]he appellate court shall not consider motions or requests for relief during the pendency of [a] bankruptcy [stay].” Based on Rule 54(c), the ICA concluded that it could not consider the appeal while Hokulani Square was in bankruptcy. That conclusion is not supported by HRAP Rule 54(c), nor is it supported by the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code. Hawai
'i courts 
-13­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
have looked to 11 U.S.C. § 362 (2006)13 to determine the limits 
of bankruptcy stays for purposes of HRAP Rule 54. See, e.g., 
Onaka v. Onaka, 112 Hawai 'i 374, 379-80, 146 P.3d 89, 94-95 
(2006). 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) stays the “commencement or 
continuation . . . of a judicial . . . proceeding against the [bankruptcy] debtor” during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. (Emphasis added). It is well established that the automatic stay is limited to proceedings against debtors and does not apply to non-bankrupt codefendants. See Maritime Elec. Co. v. United 
Jersey Bank, 959 F.2d 1194, 1203-06 (3d Cir. 1991) (“Within a single case, some actions may be stayed, others not. Multiple claim and multiple party litigation must be disaggregated so that particular claims, counterclaims, crossclaims and third-party claims are treated independently when determining which of their respective proceedings are subject to the bankruptcy stay.”); Ingersoll-Rand Fin. Corp. v. Miller Mining Co., 817 F.2d 1424, 1427 (9th Cir. 1987) (“[S]tays pursuant to section 362(a) are limited to debtors and do not include non-bankrupt co-defendants.”); Wedgeworth v. Fibreboard Corp., 706 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir. 1983); In re Advanced Ribbons & Office Prods., Inc., 125 B.R. 259, 263 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1991); 3 Collier on Bankruptcy § 362.03[3][d] (Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer 
13
 11 U.S.C. § 362 has been amended in ways that do not materially
affect the relevant portion of the statute. Bankruptcy Technical Corrections
Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-327, § 2(a)(12), 124 Stat. 3557, at 3558-59
(2010).
 
-14­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
eds., 16th ed.). In the instant case, the automatic stay is
 
limited to proceedings against debtor Hokulani Square and does
 not apply to the other non-bankrupt parties. See id. Therefore,
 
the ICA erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over
 Buffington and Integrity’s appeal because Hokulani Square is in
 bankruptcy.
 
B. 	The December 2, 2009 good faith settlement determination was
included in the record on appeal
 
The ICA concluded that it could not review the good
 
faith settlement determination made by the bankruptcy court
 
because the determination was not in the record on appeal. 
Contrary to the ICA’s assertion, the good faith settlement
 determination was transmitted from the bankruptcy court to the
 circuit court on December 31, 2009, and was integrated into the
 circuit court’s record. Accordingly, the good faith settlement
 determination was part of the ROA when the record was transmitted
 to the ICA on February 22, 2010. Therefore, the ICA erred in
 concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over Buffington and
 Integrity’s appeal because the December 2, 2009 good faith
 settlement order was not in the record on appeal.
 
C. 	The ICA had appellate jurisdiction pursuant to HRS §§ 602-57
and 663-15.5(e)
 
The ICA also held that it did not have appellate
 
jurisdiction pursuant to HRS §§ 602-57 and 663-15.5(e). 
HRS § 602-57 provides, in relevant part:
 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,
 
-15­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the intermediate appellate court shall have
jurisdiction, subject to transfer as provided in
section 602-58 or review on application for a writ of
certiorari as provided in section 602-59:
 
(1) To hear and determine appeals from
any court or agency when appeals are allowed by
law[.]
 
(Emphasis added). 
HRS § 663-15.5(e) provides:
 
A party aggrieved by a court determination on
the issue of good faith may appeal the determination.
The appeal shall be filed within twenty days after
service of written notice of the determination, or
within any additional time not exceeding twenty days
as the court may allow.
 
(Emphasis added). 
Buffington argues that the ICA erred when it concluded 
that “it is reasonable to infer from the plain language of HRS 
§ 602-57 and HRS § 663-15.5(e) that the word ‘court’ refers to only Hawai
'i state courts, and does not refer to a United States 
Bankruptcy Court.” Regarding HRS § 602-57(1), Buffington asserts that “if ‘plain language’ truly governs the meaning of ‘any court,’ then that unrestricted term includes all courts, both state and federal.” Buffington also contends that “[c]onversely, if the Legislature plainly meant to limit appellate jurisdiction to state courts, then it plainly would have written Section 602­57(1) to say so.” 
Regarding HRS § 663-15.5(e), Buffington asserts that
 
“federal courts can, and have, decided good faith petitions made
 under [HRS] Chapter 663[]” and “[u]nder the ICA’s reasoning, such
 determinations are immune from appellate review, because they
 
-16­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
would not be made by a ‘state’ court.” Buffington further
 
asserts that “the ICA’s interpretation of Section 663-15.5 and
 Section 602-57 [] defeat[s Buffington’s] right to appeal [the
 bankruptcy court’s] good faith determination” because “once a
 remand occurs, the federal courts have no power over the matter.” 
“[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.” Estate of 
Roxas v. Marcos, 121 Hawai
'i 59, 66, 214 P.3d 598, 605 (2009) 
(citations omitted). “[W]here the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, [the appellate court’s] sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.” Id. 
HRS § 602-57(1) confers on the ICA jurisdiction “[t]o
 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
 are allowed by law[.]” (Emphasis added). This statute requires
 that the appeal be “from any court or agency” and that it be
 “allowed by law[.]” Both requirements were met here. At the
 time the notices of appeal were filed, this case had been
 remanded to the circuit court of the first circuit, and the
 notices of appeal were filed in that court. Thus, the
 requirement that the appeal be from “any court” was satisfied
 since the circuit court is clearly a “court” within the meaning
 of the statute. 
Moreover, the appeal was “allowed by” HRS § 663­
15.5(e), which provides that “[a] party aggrieved by a court
 determination on the issue of good faith may appeal [that]
 
-17­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
determination.” The plain language of that statute does not
 
limit its application to orders entered by state courts.14
 
Moreover, even if we were to interpret it as being limited to
 state court orders, as we set forth below, although the order was
 entered by the bankruptcy court, it did not become a nullity when
 the case was remanded to the circuit court. 16 James Wm. Moore
 et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 107 App. 113[2][b], at 200-01
 (3d. ed. 2010) (“Orders entered by the district court prior to a
 remand order are not nullities.”) To the contrary, unless it was
 modified or set aside by the circuit court (neither of which
 occurred here), it continued in effect even after the remand. 
See id. Thus, regardless of the fact that it was originally
 
entered by the bankruptcy court, it was an order of the circuit
 court at the time the notices of appeal were filed. 
This result is consistent with well-established
 
principles of jurisdiction regarding remanded claims. One
 prominent commentator has noted that underlying orders made by
 the federal court remain in effect in the remanded state court
 action until the state court takes action to modify or set them
 aside:
 
Orders entered by the district court prior to a
remand order are not nullities. Insofar as they are

 Indeed, as noted by the dissent, HRS § 663-15.5(e) has been
applied by the Hawai' i federal courts, and provides a basis for an appeal in
the federal system from good faith settlement determinations made by those
courts. Dissenting opinion at 3, 3 n.2 (citing White v. Sabatino, 526 F.Supp. 2d 1135 (D. Haw. 2007) and Whirlpool Corporation v. CIT Group/BusinessCredit, Inc., 293 F. Supp. 2d 1144 (D. Haw. 2003)). Such a result is possibleonly if “a court” is interpreted as including federal courts.

interlocutory and are included within the action or
the part of the action remanded, they would ordinarily
remain in effect, following the remand, until the
state court took appropriate action to modify or set
them aside. 
16 Moore’s Federal Practice at 200-01 (3d. ed. 2010) (footnotes
 
omitted).
 
This principle has been recognized by both federal and
 
state courts. In Powers v. Southland Corp., 4 F.3d 223, 224 (3d
 Cir. 1993), the Third Circuit considered whether the federal
 courts retained jurisdiction to review an order granting a
 relation back amendment that added a new party after the
 expiration of the statute of limitations. The addition of the
 new party destroyed diversity jurisdiction requiring remand of
 the underlying action to state court. Id. The Third Circuit
 
ultimately concluded that the decision on the relation back
 amendment was not final and that the federal appellate court
 lacked jurisdiction to review it. Id. at 237.
 
The Third Circuit also considered whether the federal
 
court’s decision regarding the validity of the relation back
 amendment would be reviewable in state appellate court. Id. at
 
225. The Third Circuit found that it was “aware of no doctrine
 
that would bar state courts from reviewing the district court’s
 decision, and hence that decision will both have no preclusive
 effect on the parties and may be effectively reviewed by the
 
-19­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
state appellate courts.”15 Id.; see also In re C & M Props.,
 
L.L.C., 563 F.3d 1156, 1166 (10th Cir. 2009) (noting that state
 
courts are “free to revisit any issue decided by the federal
 court in a remanded claim prior to remand, and [are] ‘perfectly
 free to reject the remanding court’s reasoning’”) (citation
 omitted).
 
Similarly, in Southern Leasing Corp. v. Tufts, 804 P.2d
 
1321, 1322-23 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1991), the Court of Appeals of
 Arizona held that a state court could properly make its own
 findings regarding service of process, which was an issue that
 had formed the basis for the federal court’s order of remand. 
The state court reasoned that because the federal court had
 remanded the entire case to state court and the remand was
 unreviewable in federal court, “there is no issue preclusion and
 [the defendant] is free to litigate the issue [of service of
 process] in state court.” Id. at 1323. 
The foregoing cases illustrate that state courts have
 
jurisdiction to review pre-remand orders entered by federal
 courts in cases that are remanded back to a state court. In the
 instant case, on December 16, 2009, the bankruptcy court remanded
 the entirety of the adversary proceeding to the circuit court. 
Six days after the remand, Buffington and Integrity filed notices

 The Third Circuit in Powers also noted that the law of the case
 
doctrine sets “limitation[s] on the state trial court’s reconsideration of
issues decided by the federal trial court . . . [but does] not limit the state
appellate court’s power to review the decision.” 4 F.3d at 234 (emphasis in
original).
 
-20­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of appeal in the circuit court, appealing the good faith
 
determination to the ICA pursuant to HRS § 663-15.5(e). At that
 time, the good faith determination had not been modified or set
 aside by the circuit court, and thus remained in effect. Since
 HRS § 601-57 gives the ICA jurisdiction over appeals from the
 circuit court that are “allowed by law,” and HRS § 663-15.5(e)
 authorized an appeal from the good faith determination, the ICA
 had jurisdiction over the appeal.
 
We respectfully disagree with the dissent’s suggestion 
that the above-cited authorities are distinguishable because they involved “non-final interlocutory decision[s] that [were] not appealable in the federal system.” Dissenting Opinion at 5-6. First, the bankruptcy court’s good faith settlement determination is not a final, appealable order within the meaning of HRS § 641­1(a), since it does not completely resolve all claims against all parties in the underlying action.
16 Jenkins v. Cades Shutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) 
(“an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP 54(b)”); see also White v. Sabatino, 
16
 Accordingly, we respectfully disagree with the dissent’s
suggestion that a circuit court’s good faith settlement determination is
appealable to the ICA pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a). Dissenting opinion at 3.
Although HRS § 641-1(a) allows for appeals from final judgments, it is not the
only statute to specifically authorize an appeal from a circuit court order.
See, e.g., HRS § 667-51(a) (specifying orders entered in a foreclosure case
that “shall be final and appealable,” despite lack of conformity with HRS
§ 641-1). Here, appeal is specifically authorized by HRS § 663-15.5. 
-21­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Civ. Nos. 04-00500 ACK/LEK, 05-00025 ACK/LEK, 2007 WL 2462634, at
 
*4 (D. Haw. 2007) (concluding that an order granting a good faith
 settlement determination was “an interlocutory order because
 final judgment has not been entered in the case nor has final
 judgment been directed as to fewer than all of the claims of
 parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
 Procedure.”). 
Moreover, Powers and the other authorities cited above
 
focused on the question of whether the order at issue was
 appealable in federal court only insofar as it related to whether
 the state court might be barred by principles of issue preclusion
 from modifying or rescinding the order on remand. Powers, 4 F.3d
 
at 234 (noting that, because the order “was interlocutory in
 nature, there was no opportunity for the decision to have been
 reviewed in the federal courts, and, as such, the decision has no
 preclusive effect on state courts”) (emphasis added); C & M
 Props., 563 F.3d at 1166 (noting that issue preclusion does not
 attach in remanded claims because the parties could not have
 obtained review of the judgment in the initial action as a matter
 of law); S. Leasing, 804 P.2d at 1323 (noting that there was no
 issue preclusion where the party could not have the federal
 district court’s remand order reviewed in the federal system). 
However, in the instant case the filing of the bankruptcy court’s
 remand order divested the district court of jurisdiction before
 
-22­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
it could rule on the appeal.17 Since Buffington and Integrity
 
could not have their appeal resolved in the district court, the
 
bankruptcy court’s good faith determination could not have any
 issue preclusive effect when the case was returned to state
 court. See Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai
'i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 
(2004) (requiring, inter alia, a final judgment on the merits
 before issue preclusion may be applied); see also Restatement
 (Second) of Judgments § 28, at 273 (1980) (stating that even if 
an issue is “litigated and determined to be a valid and final
 judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment,
 relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the
 parties is not precluded . . . [if t]he party against whom
 preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law, have obtained
 review of the judgment in the initial action ”) (emphasis
 
17
 Federal cases indicate that the district court here did not retain 
jurisdiction over the appeal to the district court because the bankruptcy
court divested the federal courts of jurisdiction by remanding the entire caseto state court. See, e.g., C & M Props., 563 F.3d at 1159-62 (“It is long-
settled that a remand order renders the district court without jurisdictionover remanded claims, such that any continued litigation over those claimsbecomes a futile thing.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoMathewson v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 82 Hawai' i 57, 70-74, 919 P.2d 969, 982-86
(1996) (discussing how federal district courts are divested of jurisdictionafter remand and state circuit courts’ jurisdiction is restored). As such, itappears that once the bankruptcy court in the instant case remanded theadversary proceeding to state court, the bankruptcy court and the districtcourt lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the good faithsettlement. 
As noted by the dissent, Buffington and Integrity’s inability to
obtain appellate review from the federal courts is not, standing alone,
sufficient to establish a right of appeal in state court. Dissenting opinion
at 4 n.3 (quoting Chambers v. Levy, 60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978)).
Nevertheless, permitting an appeal in the instant case effectuates the policy,
set forth in HRS § 663-15.5(e), of allowing prompt appeals of good faith
settlement determinations.

added) ; Clusiau v. Clusiau Enterprises, Inc., 225 Ariz. 247,
251, 236 P.3d 1194, 1198 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2010) (declining to
 apply issue preclusion to a small claims court judgment, in part,
 because it was not appealable as a matter of law); Algonquin
 Power Income Fund v. Christine Falls of New York, Inc., 362 Fed.
 Appx. 151, 155 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that collateral estoppel
 did not apply because appellant could not have appealed as a
 matter of right). The good faith settlement order was therefore
 interlocutory upon remand to the circuit court, and the
 principles set forth by Professor Moore and in cases such as
 Powers are fully applicable. 
Finally, we address the ICA’s holding that it does not
 
have jurisdiction after remand to review an order entered by a
 bankruptcy court based on the proposition that bankruptcy courts
 have original and exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases
 and, accordingly, that “bankruptcy court orders are not subject
 to collateral attack in other courts.” (Quoting Gruntz v. Cnty.
 of Los Angeles, 202 F.3d 1074, 1082 (9th Cir. 2000)). In support
 of this proposition, the ICA relies on Gruntz and McGhan v. Rutz,
 
18 This court has explicitly adopted the reasoning of portions of the
Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28 with regard to exceptions to issue
preclusion. See Marsland v. Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness, 66 Haw.
119, 124-25, 657 P.2d 1035, 1038-39 (1983) (recognizing the Restatementexception to issue preclusion when “[t]he issue is one of law and . . . a newdetermination is warranted . . . to avoid inequitable administration of thelaws”); Kaho' ohanohano v. Dep’t of Human Servs., 117 Hawai' i 262, 303-05, 178
P.3d 538, 579-81 (2008) (determining that the Restatement exception regardinga “potential adverse impact of the determination on the public interest[,]” or“because the party sought to be precluded . . . did not have an adequateopportunity or incentive to obtain full and fair adjudication in the initialaction” did not apply to the facts of the case). 
-24­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
288 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2002). Both cases are
 
distinguishable because neither case considered state court
 jurisdiction after remand to state court but instead considered
 jurisdiction to entertain a collateral attack on bankruptcy court
 orders in separate proceedings. See Gruntz, 202 F.3d at 1087-88
 
(discussing the interaction of federal bankruptcy court
 proceedings and state court criminal proceedings and holding,
 inter alia, that the bankruptcy court automatic stay does not
 void state criminal judgments and that state trial courts need
 not seek bankruptcy court approval before commencing criminal
 proceedings); McGhan, 288 F.3d at 1175 (holding that a state
 court lacked authority to modify a bankruptcy court’s earlier
 determination discharging a claim and permanently enjoining a
 creditor from collecting on a debt in a separate state court
 action). In the instant case, Buffington is not mounting a
 collateral attack on a bankruptcy court order in a separate state
 court proceeding. Instead, Buffington is challenging, in a
 remanded state court case, an order previously entered in the
 bankruptcy court.
 
The ICA further relies on Noghrey v. Town of
 
Brookhaven, 305 A.D.2d 474-75 (N.Y. App. Div. 2003) in support of
 its conclusion that HRS § 663-15.5(e) does not authorize an
 appeal in state court from a federal bankruptcy court order. 
Noghrey also is distinguishable. In Noghrey, the plaintiff
 attempted to appeal a bankruptcy court’s summary judgment order
 
-25­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to a state appellate court under a New York statute generally 
granting appellate jurisdiction to the New York Appellate Division. 305 A.D.2d at 474-75. At the time the appeal was filed, the case was pending in federal bankruptcy court and had not been remanded. Id. In contrast, in the instant case, the 
bankruptcy court, after entering its good faith determination, remanded the entire adversary proceeding to state court, vesting the state courts with jurisdiction over all interlocutory orders. See C & M Props., 563 F.3d at 1162; Mathewson, 82 Hawai
'i at 70­
74, 919 P.2d at 982-86. 
Accordingly, the good faith settlement order entered by
 
the bankruptcy court prior to remand is properly appealable in
 the state court system pursuant to HRS §§ 602-57(1) and 663-15.5. 
Once the case was remanded to the circuit court, the good faith
 settlement determination “remain[ed] in effect” until “modif[ied]
 or set [] aside” by the circuit court. See 16 Moore’s Federal
 
Practice, at 200-01. HRS § 663-15.5 authorized an appeal from
 the determination, and HRS §§ 602-57(1) provided the ICA with
 appellate jurisdiction since the appeal was allowed by law, and
 was filed in the circuit court.
 
D. The Joint Motion to Modify the Record is not moot
 
The ICA denied Buffington and Integrity’s Joint Motion
 
to Modify the Record on the ground that it was moot, apparently
 
because the ICA had already dismissed Buffington and Integrity’s
 appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Because we conclude
 
-26­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the ICA erred in dismissing the appeal, the Joint Motion to
 
Modify the Record is not moot. 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s
 
dismissal order and its order denying the Motion to Modify the
 Record, and remand to the ICA for further proceedings consistent
 with this opinion.
