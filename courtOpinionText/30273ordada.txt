IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
LIONEL LETOTO, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the papers submitted by Lionel
 
Letoto, which we treat as a petition for relief, it appears that
 
the petition seeks relief on matters within the jurisdiction of
 the circuit court, not the supreme court. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the papers as a petition for relief without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for relief is
 
dismissed without prejudice to seeking relief in the circuit
 court.
