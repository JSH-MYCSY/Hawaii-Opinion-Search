IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
DAVID KEANU SAI, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE CLYDE SUMIDA, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(Case No. 1DTI-09-167852)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
prohibition filed by petitioner David Keanu Sai and the papers in
support, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear
and indisputable right to relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of prohibition is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action.)  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
prohibition is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 25, 2010.
