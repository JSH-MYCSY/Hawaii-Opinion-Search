NO. 30342
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
RICHARD BLAISDELL, Petitioner,
vs.
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Richard Blaisdell’s
“petition for a writ of mandamus,” which we treat as a petition
for a declaratory judgment, it appears that issuance of a
declaratory judgment on the constitutionality and enforceability
of Act 75, 26th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2009) is not within the
original jurisdiction of the supreme court.  See HRS §§ 602-5
(Supp. 2009) and 632-1 (1993).  Therefore,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a
declaratory judgment is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 25, 2010.
