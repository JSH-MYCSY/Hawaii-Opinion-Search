IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
HAWAII PAROLING AUTHORITY, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Michael C. Tierney's petition for
a writ of habeas corpus and motion for appointment of counsel, it
appears that habeas corpus relief is available to petitioner in
the circuit court and petitioner presents no special reason for
invoking the supreme court’s original jurisdiction.  See Oili v.
Chang, 57 Haw. 511, 512, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1) the motion for
appointment of counsel is denied and (2) the petition for a writ
of habeas corpus is denied without prejudice to seeking habeas
corpus relief in the circuit court pursuant to HRS § 660-3
(1993).
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 17, 2010.
