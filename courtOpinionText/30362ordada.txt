ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the complaint filed in the
supreme court by plaintiff Janice K. M. Chung Keli #ihananui, it
appears that we lack jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate
plaintiff’s claim of discrimination.  See HRS § 602-5 (Supp.
2009).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 17, 2010.
