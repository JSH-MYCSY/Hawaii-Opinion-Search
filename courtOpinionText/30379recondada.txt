IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
MARY E. WHITE, Petitioner,
vs.
SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY and
CHIEF JUSTICE STUART RABNER, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Mary E. White’s papers 
received and filed on April 9, 2010, which we treat as a motion
for reconsideration of the March 23, 2010 dismissal order, it
appears that the motion for reconsideration is untimely.  See
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure 40(a) (“A motion for
reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days after
the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling unless
by special leave additional time is granted during such period by
a judge or justice of the appellate court involved.” ). 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
reconsideration is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 19, 2010.
