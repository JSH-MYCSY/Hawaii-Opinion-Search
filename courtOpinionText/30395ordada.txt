IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
RONALD HANSON and KATHY HANSON, Petitioners,
vs.
THE HONORABLE GARY W. B. CHANG, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, and
CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT,
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1935)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioners Ronald Hanson’s and
Kathy Hanson’s March 23, 2010 papers requesting this court to
“intervene in [its] supervisory capacity,” which we treat as a
petition for writ of mandamus, as supplemented by petitioners’
March 29, 2010 papers, it appears that petitioners fail to
demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief.  Therefore,
petitioners are not entitled to mandamus relief.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 5, 2010.
