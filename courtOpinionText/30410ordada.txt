IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
RICHARD ELINE, Petitioner,
vs.
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
mandamus filed by petitioner Richard Eline, it appears that
petitioner fails to demonstrate that he is entitled to mandamus
relief.  See HRS § 602-5(3) (Supp. 2009) (The supreme court has
jurisdiction and power to issue writs of mandamus directed to
public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their
offices.); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91
Hawai#i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is
available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed
to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and
certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly
prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is
available.).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 19, 2010.
