MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(S.P.P. No. 10-1-0018)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and
indisputable right to relief.  See Hawai #i Rules of Penal
Procedure, Rule 40(a) and (c)(2); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200,
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action.).  Therefore
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 4, 2010.
