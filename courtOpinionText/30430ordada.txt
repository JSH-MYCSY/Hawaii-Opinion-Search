NO. 30430
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE GLENN S. HARA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CIVIL NO. 00-1-0377)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
appears that petitioner's motion for return of property is
pending in a civil action in which the non-hearing provision of
Civil Administration Order 9-2 applies and the right of
confrontation does not apply.  Therefore, petitioner is not
entitled to mandamus relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200,
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action.).  Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 4, 2010.
