MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 08-1-0869)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, it appears that petitioner
seeks a writ of habeas corpus releasing him on bail pending his
appeal before the intermediate court of appeals in No. 29993. 
Habeas corpus is not a vehicle for release on bail pending appeal
and this court does not have jurisdiction to order petitioner's
release on bail pending appeal in No. 29993.  See HRS ยง 660-3
(1993); HRAP 9(b).  Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
habeas corpus is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 4, 2010.
