ANTHONY GOUVEIA, Petitioner,
vs.
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
mandamus filed by petitioner Anthony Gouveia, it appears that
petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to
relief.  Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus
relief.  See HRS § 602-5(3) (Supp. 2009) (The supreme court has
jurisdiction and power to issue writs of mandamus directed to
public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their
offices.); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91
Hawai#i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is
available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed
to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and
certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly
prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is
available.); Salling v. Moon, 76 Hawai# i 273, 274 n. 3, 874 P.2d
1098, 1099 n.3 (1994) (A duty is ministerial where the law
prescribes and defines the duty to be performed with such
precision and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of
discretion and judgment.).  Accordingly,2IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 12, 2010.
