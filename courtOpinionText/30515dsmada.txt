TAWHIRI POWER LLC, Petitioner,
vs.
HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, INC., 
FRANK D. ROTHSCHILD, BYRON C. “KALE” FELDMAN, 
and SCOTT H. STRAUSS, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ. and 
Circuit Judge Kubo, in place of Recktenwald, J., recused)
Upon consideration of Tawhiri Power LLC’s Petition for
Writ of Prohibition, it appears we lack jurisdiction to issue a
writ of prohibition against the named respondents.  None of the
named respondents are "courts of inferior jurisdiction" and no
appeal is pending in the supreme court.  See HRS §§ 602-5(a)(3)
and (a)(5).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, June 8, 2010.
