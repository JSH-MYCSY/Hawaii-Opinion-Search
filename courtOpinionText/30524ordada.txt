NO. 30524
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
EVERETT SPEARS, Petitioner,
vs.
CLAYTON FRANK, DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 00-1-0333)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Everett Spears' petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, it appears that petitioner seeks habeas
corpus relief in the supreme court from the sentence imposed on
petitioner in Cr. No. 00-1-0333.  However, the record of Cr. No.
00-1-0333 shows that petitioner is seeking relief from his
sentence in the circuit court by papers filed on July 22, 2008
("motion for writ"), March 16, 2010 ("motion for writ"), May 11,
2010 (motion for appointment of counsel), and May 18, 2010
("motion to clarify sentence") -- all of which are pending before
the circuit court, and petitioner fails to demonstrate that the
circuit court has, in fact, refused to file a "writ of habeas
corpus" submitted by petitioner.  Therefore, petitioner presents
no special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original
jurisdiction.  See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 511, 512, 557 P.2d 787,
788 (1976).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for writ of habeas corpus
without payment of the filing fee.2IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
habeas corpus is denied without prejudice to seeking habeas
corpus relief in the circuit court pursuant to HRS § 660-3
(1993).
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 15, 2010.
