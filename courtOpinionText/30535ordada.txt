NO. 30535
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS, Petitioner,
vs.
HAWAII STATE LEGISLATURE, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By:  Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Recktenwald, JJ. and
Circuit Judge Border, in place of Duffy, J., recused)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
mandamus filed by petitioner Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the
papers in support, and respondent’s answer, it appears that
petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to
mandamus relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action.); In re Disciplinary Bd. Of the Hawaii Supreme
Court, 91 Hawai #i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus
relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty
allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is
clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so
plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy
is available.).  Petitioner has failed to establish that the
legislative action that it seeks to compel is ministerial in
nature, such that “the law prescribes and defines the duty to be2performed with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing
to the exercise of discretion or judgment.”  Salling v. Moon, 76
Hawaii 273, 275 n.3, 874 P.2d 1098, 1100 n.3 (1994) (brackets and
citation omitted).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 18, 2010.
