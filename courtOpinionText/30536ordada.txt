NO. 30536
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE CRAIG H. NAKAMURA, CHIEF JUDGE OF THE
INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS, STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(No. 29993)
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)ORDER
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
appears that the transcripts for the record on appeal in No.
29993 were not completed until June 3, 2010, whereupon appellate
counsel filed petitioner’s opening brief on June 7, 2010. 
Therefore, petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and
indisputable right to mandamus relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91
Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action.).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 15, 2010.
