NO. 30545
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
LEILA HAYASHIDA HENNA, as Personal Representative of the Estate
of Harold Hifuo Hayashida, and as Successor Trustee of the
Harold H. Hayashida Revocable Trust, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE GERONIMO VALDRIZ, JUDGE OF THE FAMILY
COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I; and
NAOMI IWASAKI HAYASHIDA, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(FC-D No. 08-1-0657)
ORDER
(By: Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.; with Recktenwald, J.,
concurring separately, with whom Moon, C.J., joins)
Upon consideration of petitioner Leila Hayashida
Henna’s petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in
support, it appears that petitioner’s April 1, 2010 motion for
attorney’s fees and costs is not within the ambit of HRAP 4(a)(3)
(2006) inasmuch as: (1) the April 1, 2010 motion is a motion for
attorney’s fees and costs under HFCR 68; (2) HRAP 4(a)(3) applies
to a motion for attorney’s fees and costs under HRCP 54(d); and
(3) Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai# i 202, 159 P.3d 814 (2007)
applied HRAP 4(a)(3) to a motion for costs under HRCP 54(d), not
HRCP 68.  The April 1, 2010 motion for attorney’s fees and costs
will not be deemed denied by operation of HRAP 4(a)(3) if the
motion is not disposed by June 30, 2010.
It further appears that postponement of the hearing on
petitioner’s April 1, 2010 motion for attorney’s fees and costs
was within the discretion of the respondent judge and was not a
flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion.  Therefore, petitioner
is not entitled to mandamus relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 912Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus
and is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the
petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief
and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged
wrong or obtain the requested action.  Such writs are not
intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the
lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in
lieu of normal appellate procedures.  Where a court has
discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to
act.).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 24, 2010.
