NO. 30612
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(S.P.P. No. 10-1-0018)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that Hawai #i Rules of
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(c)(2) authorized respondent to
treat petitioner's March 25, 2010 petition as a petition for
post-conviction relief under HRPP Rule 40 and require petitioner
to file a supplemental petition in the form of an HRPP Rule 40
petition for post-conviction relief.  Unless and until such
supplemental petition was filed, respondent was not obliged to
hear or review the merits of the March 25, 2010 petition. 
Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief.  See
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 20, 2010.
