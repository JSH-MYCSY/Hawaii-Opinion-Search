NO. 30613
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
CHRIS GRINDLING, Petitioner,
vs.
CLERKS OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURTS,
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
mandamus filed by petitioner Chris Grindling, it appears that the 
notices of appeal submitted by petitioner in district court cases
DCSP 09-1-0002 and DCSP 09-1-0003 were filed and processed by the
clerk on July 7, 2010.  It further appears that petitioner fails
to present this court with sufficient information to enable this
court to determine whether the clerk has refused or neglected to
file other papers submitted by petitioner.  Therefore, petitioner
is not entitled to mandamus relief.  See HRS § 602-5(3) (Supp.
2009) (The supreme court has jurisdiction and power to issue
writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to
fulfill the duties of their offices.); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of
Hawaii Supreme Court, 91 Hawai #i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693
(1999) (Mandamus relief is available to compel an official to
perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the
individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is
ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt,
and no other remedy is available.)  Accordingly,2IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.  The denial is without prejudice to the
refiling of a petition that details -- as to title, date, court,
and case number -- the papers for which mandamus relief is
sought.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 26, 2010.
