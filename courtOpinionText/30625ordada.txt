ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
mandamus filed by petitioner Andrew D. Woerner, it appears that
petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to
relief.  Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus
relief.  See HRS § 602-5(3) (2009) (“The supreme court shall have
jurisdiction and power . . . [t]o exercise original jurisdiction
in all questions . . . arising under writs of mandamus directed
to public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their
offices[.]);”  In re. Disciplinary Bd. Of the Hawaii Supreme
Court, 91 Hawai #i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus
relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty
allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is
clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so
plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy
is available.); Salling v. Moon, 76 Hawai #i 273, 274 n. 3, 874
P.2d 1098, 1099 n.3 (1994) (“A duty is ministerial where the law2prescribes and defines the duty to be performed with such
precision and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of
discretion and judgment.”).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 2, 2010.
