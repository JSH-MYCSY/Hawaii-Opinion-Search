MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
LOREN J. THOMAS, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney,
City and County of Honolulu, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(Cr. No. 08-1-0869)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails
to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief.  See
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.).  Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 2, 2010.
