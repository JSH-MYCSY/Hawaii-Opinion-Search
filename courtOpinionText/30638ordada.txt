vs.
CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT, 
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent.

ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of John Kalua# u III's July 21, 2010
letter to the Chief Justice, which we treat as a petition for a
writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner is not entitled to
mandamus relief.  See HRS ยง 602-5(3) (Supp. 2009) ("The supreme
court shall have jurisdiction and power . . . to exercise
original jurisdiction in all questions arising under writs
directed to courts of inferior jurisdiction and returnable before
the supreme court."); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action.).  Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the July 21, 2010 letter as a petition for a
writ of mandamus without payment of the filing fee.2IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 2, 2010.
