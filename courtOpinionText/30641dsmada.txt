vs.
RICHARD YEE CHOON PANG and
RAYMONDE JEANNE CADORET PANG, Defendants.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the “complaint for fraud” filed
in the supreme court on August 23, 2010 by plaintiff Wellington
Yee Yun Pang, it appears that we lack jurisdiction to adjudicate
the complaint.  See HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2009).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 23, 2010 complaint
is dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall not accept any further filings in this case.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 31, 2010.
