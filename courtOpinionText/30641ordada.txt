vs.

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the “complaint for fraud” filed
in the supreme court by plaintiffs Wellington Yee Yun Pang and
Andrea Janet Pang, it appears that we lack jurisdiction to
adjudicate the complaint.  See HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2009). 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 10, 2010.
