NO. 30642
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                 
P. SPENCER JOHNSON, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE PAUL T. MURAKAMI, JUDGE OF THE FAMILY
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, and
LESLEY D. JOHNSON, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(FC-D No. 10-1-0437)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner P. Spencer Johnsonâ€™s
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
appears that petitioner can seek review of the April 8, 2010
post-nuptial agreement order by appealing from the order finally
dividing property and debts in FC-D No. 10-1-0437.  See Eaton v.
Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987). 
Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief.  See
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.  Such writs are
not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of
the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal
remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures.).  Accordingly,2IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 12, 2010.
