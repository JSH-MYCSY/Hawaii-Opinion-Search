CHRIS GRINDLING, Petitioner,
vs.
SECOND CIRCUIT COURT, STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(S.P. No. 09-1-0081)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
mandamus filed by petitioner Chris Grindling, it appears that
petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief.  See HRS § 634J-
7(c); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91 Hawai# i
363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is available
to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an
individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain,
the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as
to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available.) 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 25, 2010.
