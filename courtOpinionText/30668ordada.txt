CHRIS GRINDLING, Petitioner,
vs.
DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL and COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL
CONDUCT, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Chris Grindling’s
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner is
not entitled to mandamus relief.  See HRS § 602-5(3) (Supp. 2009)
(The supreme court has jurisdiction and power to issue writs of
mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to fulfill
the duties of their offices.); Barnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawai #i
109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996) (Mandamus relief is
available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed
to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and
certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly
prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is
available.); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91
Hawai#i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Disciplinary
counsel’s duties are owed to the supreme court, not to the
individual complainant; the duties involve judgment and
discretion and are not ministerial.); Rules of the Supreme Court
of the State of Hawai #i, Rule 8.6(d) (“[T]he Commission [on
Judicial Conduct] shall determine whether [a] complaint warrants
investigation and evaluation.”).  Accordingly,2IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 25, 2010.
