NO. 30678
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
                                                                
LORI TOWNSEND, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE EDWARD H. KUBO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, and
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(FC-CR No. 10-1-1595)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Lori Townsend’s
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
appears that the respondent judge’s August 18, 2010 ruling that
petitioner does not have a bona fide Fifth Amendment privilege
was not beyond the bounds of reason or in disregard of the law
permitting the respondent judge to appraise petitioner’s claim of
privilege by the respondent judge’s personal perception of the
peculiarities of FC-CR No. 10-1-1595.  See State v. Kupihea, 80
Hawai#i 307, 312-13, 909 P.2d 1122, 1127-28 (1996).  The denial
of petitioner’s motion to quash the prosecution’s subpoena was
not a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion and consequently,
petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (A
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.  Such writs are2not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of
the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal
remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures.  Where a court
has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to
act.).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the stay of the proceedings
in FC-CR No. 10-1-1595 is lifted.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 25, 2010.
