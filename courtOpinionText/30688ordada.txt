MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE DERRICK H. M. CHAN, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 88-2209 and CR. NO. 89-0024)
ORDER
(By: Moon, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and
indisputable right to mandamus relief.  See HRS ยง 804-51 (Supp
2009); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338
(1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will
not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
action.).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 27, 2010.
