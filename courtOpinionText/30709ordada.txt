IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION FOR A SPECIAL PROCEEDING
TO REVIEW CONTEMPT CONVICTION SUMMARILY IMPOSED 
ON AUGUST 27, 2010
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., Acoba, Duffy, and Recktenwald, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Lee, assigned by reason of vacancy).
Lori Townsend, the Complaining Witness in FC-CR 10-1-
1595, initiated this special proceeding, pursuant to HRS § 710-
1077(5) (1993), to review the “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law and Order Finding Complaining Witness in Contempt of Court
Under 710-1077(3)(a),” entered on August 27, 2010 in FC-CR 10-1-
1595.  We review the August 27, 2010 order for an abuse of
discretion.  See In re Nam, 65 Haw. 119, 125, 648 P.2d 1101, 1105
(1982).
Having reviewed the record of FC-CR 10-1-1595 and
having considered the arguments advanced by the Complaining
Witness, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its
discretion in summarily convicting and sentencing the Complaining
Witness for criminal contempt of court pursuant to HRS §§ 710-
1077(1) and (3)(a).
The August 27, 2010 “Order Finding Complaining Witness
in Contempt of Court Under 710-1077(3)(a)” is affirmed.  The
motion to stay mittimus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 9, 2010.
