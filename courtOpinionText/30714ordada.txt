DEMONT R. D. CONNER Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE VIRGINIA L. CRANDALL, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(SPP NO. 06-1-0021)
ORDER
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Ayabe, assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of petitioner DeMont R. D. Conner’s
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that the Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order entered on August 31, 2010 in
SPP No. 061-1-0021 is appealable by petitioner pursuant to HRAP
40(h) and HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2009).  Therefore, petitioner is
not entitled to extraordinary relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91
Hawai#i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (A writ of
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.  Such writs are not
intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the
lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in
lieu of normal appellate procedures.).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee.2IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 16, 2010.
