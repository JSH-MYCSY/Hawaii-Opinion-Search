MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DELANIE PRESCOTT-TATE, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, Respondent.
 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Crandall, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. See 
Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 16, 2010.
