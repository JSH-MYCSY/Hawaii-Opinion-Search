IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
SOCRATES WILLIAM BUENGER, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE KEITH E. TANAKA, JUDGE OF THE FAMILY
COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(FC-D No. 05-1-0044)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Lee, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Socrates William 
Buenger's petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in 
support, it appears that: (1) HRS ยง 571-46.5(d)(1) authorized the respondent judge to require the parties to participate in a parenting program for the purpose of petitioner's March 29, 2010 motion for a timesharing and holiday visitation schedule, and (2) petitioner's inability to participate in the parenting program as of September 15, 2010 provided the respondent judge with a reasonable basis for deferring decision on the March 29, 2010 motion. 
Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to extraordinary 
relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal
 discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they
 intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures. Where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will
 not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that
 discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the
 judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a
 flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act
 on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in
 which it has a legal duty to act.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 28, 2010.
