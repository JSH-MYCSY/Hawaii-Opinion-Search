APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-0193)

 
ORDER DENYING VARIOUS MOTIONS FILED BY DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
On June 13, 2014, this Court filed a Summary
 
Disposition Order (SDO) which dismissed the appeal of Defendants-
Appellants Morton E. Bassan, Jr., and Keiko Bassan because we
 concluded that they lacked standing to pursue their appeal. On
 June 18, 2014, Defendants-Appellants filed a "Motion to Show
 Borrowers' Claims Are Both Exempt From Bankruptcy Estate or
 Abandoned by Bankruptcy Trustee to Oppose 'Summary Judgment
 Order' Filed[ ]June 13, 2014" (Motion for Reconsideration), which
 we construed as a motion for reconsideration of this Court's SDO. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 27, 2014, this Court entered an order extending the time
 
to dispose of Defendants-Appellants' Motion for Reconsideration
 through July 14, 2014. On July 9, 2014, we issued our Order
 denying Defendants-Appellants' Motion for Reconsideration.
 
Since this Court entered its June 27, 2014, order
 
extending the time to dispose of Defendants-Appellants' June 18,
 2014, Motion for Reconsideration, Defendants-Appellants have
 filed the following additional motions: (1) "Supplement -- Motion
 to Show Borrowers' Claims are Both Exempt From Bankruptcy Estate
 or Abandoned By Bankruptcy Trustee to Oppose 'Summary Judgment
 Order' Filed[ ]June 13, 2014," which was filed on July 8, 2014
 (First July 8, 2014, Motion); (2) "Supplement -- Motion to Show
 That This May Be a Time to Waive Rule to Allow Arguments and
 Other Matters Not Raised in Opening and Reply Briefs to Oppose
 'Order' Filed[ ]June 13, 2014," which was filed on July 8, 2014
 (Second July 8, 2014, Motion); (3) "Motion for Reconsideration of
 Dismissing This Case for Lack of Borrowers' Standing," which was
 filed on July 14, 2014 (July 14, 2014, Motion); (4) "Errata -Â­Motion for Reconsideration of Dismissing This Case for Lack of
 Borrowers' Standing," which was filed on July 24, 2014 (July 24,
 2014 Motion); (5) "Question Presented Motion for Reconsideration
 of Dismissing this Case for Lack of Borrowers' Standing," which
 was filed on July 29, 2014 (July 29, 2014 Motion); and (6)
 "Motion for Reconsideration Per HRS 454M Plaintiff Lacks Standing
 & Foreclosure is Void; Motion for Reconsideration Per 12[ ]CFR[ ]
 617.7010(a) Appellants Have Standing, Notice of Intent to
 Appeal," which was filed on August 11, 2014 (August 11, 2014,
 Motion). 
Upon consideration of the various motions identified in
 
(1) through (6) above that have been filed by Defendants-Appellants, we find and conclude that: (a) on June 13, 2014, this Court filed its SDO; (b) therefore, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40 (2000), Defendants-Appellants had until June 23, 2014, to file a motion for reconsideration of the SDO; (c) on June 18, 2014, Defendants-Appellants filed a

motion, which we construed as a timely motion for reconsideration
 
of the SDO; (d) on July 9, 2014, this Court denied Defendants-
Appellants' June 18, 2014, Motion for Reconsideration; (e) this
 Court did not extend the period of time for Defendants-Appellants
 to file their motion for reconsideration, and we did not grant
 Defendants-Appellants leave to file supplements to their June 18,
 2014, Motion for Reconsideration; and (f) HRAP Rule 40 does not
 authorize Defendants-Appellants to file supplements to a motion
 for reconsideration after the ten-day deadline for filing a
 motion for reconsideration; and (g) HRAP Rule 40 also does not
 authorize Defendants-Appellants to file additional motions for
 reconsideration or raise challenges to the SDO after this Court
 denied their original June 18, 2014, Motion for Reconsideration. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Defendants-Appellants
 were not authorized to file the various motions identified in (1)
 through (6) above, which are all directed, in some fashion, at
 having this Court reconsider its SDO, and we deny all of these
 motions.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants-Appellants' (1)
 
First July 8, 2014, Motion; (2) Second July 8, 2014, Motion; (3)
 July 14, 2014, Motion; (4) July 24, 2014, Motion; (5) July 29,
 2014, Motion; and (6) August 11, 2014, Motion are denied.
