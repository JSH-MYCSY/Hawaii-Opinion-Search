ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of Plaintiff/Appellant/Cross-Appellee Alden

Appellees/Cross-Appellants State of Hawai 'i, Stephen H. Levins, 
and Michael J.S. Moriyama's (the State Cross-Appellants) cross­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal, from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's September 3, 2010 
judgment, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal and cross-appeal because the September 3, 2010 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the 
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and (ii)
dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphasis added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). The 
Supreme Court of Hawai 'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
A judgment that does not specifically identify the claim or 
claims on which it enters judgment requires an appellate court to search the often voluminous record on appeal in order to determine the specific claim or claims on which judgment is entered. As the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained, "we 
should not make such searches necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although Appellant Arquette's complaint asserts four
 
separate and distinct counts, the September 3, 2010 judgment does
 not specifically identify the claim or claims on which the
 circuit court is entering judgment. Thus, the September 3, 2010
 judgment fails to satisfy requirements for an appealable judgment
 under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent the entry
 of an appealable final judgment, this appeal is premature, and we
 lack appellate jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000001. 
Accordingly,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED this appeal is dismissed for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction.
