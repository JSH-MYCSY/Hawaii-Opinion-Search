APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0151)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal from Referee Johnrae F. 
Christian's (Referee) decision that it was responsible for 
payment of medical benefits to certain employees of A-1 Master 
Roofing, Inc. (A-1), Petitioner-Appellant Hawai 'i Management 
Alliance Association (HMAA) appeals from the September 8, 2010 Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
1
(Circuit Court)  affirming Prepaid Health Care Office, Disability
Compensation Division, Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations, State of Hawai 'i's (Prepaid) Referee's Decision. 
On appeal before this court, HMAA argues that the
 
Circuit Court erred in affirming the Referee's decision because
 
it (1) failed to conclude, as a matter of law, that A-1 breached
 
its agreement with HMAA by failing to pay premiums, "thereby

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
releasing any obligation by HMAA to pay for health care services
 
rendered[;]" (2) concluded, as a matter of law, that based on
 
Williams v. Hawaii Med. Servs. Ass'n, 71 Haw. 545, 798 P.2d 442
 
(1990) and the interpretation of Hawaii Administrative Rules
 
2
(HAR) § 12-12-28  contained therein, that HMAA must pay for the
health care benefits incurred by the employees; (3) concluded, as
 
a matter of law, that the health care benefits incurred by the
 
employees should not be paid by the Prepaid Health Care Premium
 
Supplementation Fund (Fund) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
3
(HRS) § 393-48 (1993);  and (4) failed to conclude, as a matter
2 This section provides, 
§12-12-28 Cancellation of contract. (a) No health care
contractor shall cancel a contract providing in whole or in
part for health care benefits required by the statute prior
to the expiration date of the contract unless written notice
of intention to cancel on a specified date and reason
therefor has been filed with and served on the employer and
the director at least ten days prior to the specified
cancellation date.
 
(b) The ten days' advance notice requirement in
subsection (a) need not be complied with when a new
contractor is simultaneously substituted. In the event of
 substitution, the previous contractor shall immediately file
with and serve on the employer and the director, notice that
the contract was canceled, the specific date and the reason
for cancellation. 
(c) If a plan provides by its terms for an expiration
date, acceptance of the plan by the director is notice
thereof.
 
(d) The employer shall notify its covered employees of
the cancellation of coverage for nonpayment of premium. The
 employees shall be given an option of individual coverage if
premium payment is made within ten days directly to the
contractor.
 
3 HRS § 393-48 provides,
 
§393-48 Prepaid health care benefits to be paid from
the premium supplementation fund; recovery of benefits.
Prepaid health care benefits shall be paid from the premium
supplementation fund to an employee who is entitled to
receive prepaid health care benefits but cannot receive such
benefits because of bankruptcy of the employee's employer or
because the employee's employer is not in compliance with
this chapter. Benefits paid from the premium
supplementation fund to such employee may be recovered from
the employee's bankrupt or noncomplying employer. The
 director shall institute administrative and legal actions as

of law, "that the only possible monetary liability for HMAA's
 
inadvertent failure to timely provide the required notice of
 
cancellation to Prepaid is in HRS section 393-33(b), which sets
 
forth a $200 fine for any willful violation of the Prepaid Health
 
Care Act."
 
After a careful review of the record, the issues raised
 
and the arguments made by the parties, and the applicable
 
authority, we affirm the Final Judgment for the following
 
reasons:
 
The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the
 
failure of A-1 to pay premiums to HMAA, per se, released the
 
latter from any obligation to pay medical services benefits to A­
1's employees. It is undisputed that A-1 failed to pay the
 
premiums required by its contract with HMAA and thus was in
 
breach of that contract.4 However, the parties also do not
 
dispute that HMAA failed to give notice to Prepaid that it had
 terminated its contract with A-1. Moreover, the record reflects
 
that HMAA gave only retroactive notice of cancellation to A-1. 
As a result, HMAA failed to comply with the requirements of HAR §
 
12-12-28(a). The Circuit Court ruled that Williams controlled in
 
this situation, concluding that "non-compliance with rule section
 
12-12-28(a), HAR, effectively bars a health care contractor from
 
cancelling the employer's group health plan."
 
Conclusions of law are reviewed under a de novo 
standard of review. AlohaCare v. Ito, 126 Hawai
'i 326, 341, 271 
P.3d 621, 636 (2012). "[I]nsurance policies are governed by 
statutory requirements in force and effect at the time such 
policies are written[,]" and "[s]uch provisions are read into 
3(...continued)
provided in section 393-33 to effect recovery of such
benefits.

 The Group Services Agreement between A-1 and HMAA provided for the
termination of the Agreement and Plan "for failure to pay full Plan Dues and
premiums, retroactive to the last month for which payment was made in full,
unless all Plan Dues and premiums and any charges owing under this Agreement
are brought current within ten (10) days of HMAA providing written notice of
default to the Group."

each policy issued thereunder, and become a part of the contract 
with full binding effect upon each party." AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 
Inc. v. Estate of Caraang, 74 Haw. 620, 633, 851 P.2d 321, 328 (1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Properly 
promulgated "[administrative] rules have the force and effect of 
law." State v. Kirn, 70 Haw. 206, 208, 767 P.2d 1238, 1239-40 
(1989). Additionally, "[w]hen the terms of an insurance contract are in conflict with statutory language, the statute must take 
precedence over the terms of the contract." Sol v. AIG Hawai
'i 
Ins. Co., 76 Hawai 'i 304, 307, 875 P.2d 921, 924 (1994). 
Thus, HAR § 12-12-28, effective as of May 7, 1981, sets
 
out the specific procedure for the cancellation of prepaid health
 contracts and did apply to HMAA's attempt to cancel the contract
 
with A-1. That HMAA failed to comply with this procedure meant
 
that HMAA did not effectively cancel the contract, leaving it in
 
force. While A-1 is still in breach of the contract, it was
 
still incumbent on HMAA to comply with this regulation if it
 
intends to exercise its rights under the contract. Williams, 71
 
Haw. at 549-50, 798 P.2d at 444-45 (rejecting the insurer's
 argument that despite its failure to give notice under HAR § 12­
12-28(a), it had no obligation under the contract as it would
 
render the notice provision "ineffective and superfluous"); see
 
also, St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Southwestern
 
Improvement, Inc., 719 S.W.2d 708, 710 (Ark. Ct. App. 1986)
 
(construing Ark. Stat. Ann. § 81-1338(b), holding that "once a
 
policy of insurance has been procured in satisfaction of the
 
legislative requirement, it may not effectively be cancelled
 
without notice to both the employer and the Commission") and
 
Lifeline Ambulance, Inc. v. Iowa Ins. Div., 505 N.W.2d 186 (Iowa
 
1993) (termination of the insurance contract did not occur until
 
the notice required by law was given). As HMAA failed to
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
effectively terminate its contract with A-1, the Circuit Court
 
did not err in affirming the Referee's decision.
 
Therefore, we affirm the September 8, 2010 Final
 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
