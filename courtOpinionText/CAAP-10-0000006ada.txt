I.
 
On August 19, 2010, Nishimura filed a Verified
 
Complaint, alleging in relevant part:
 
3. Plaintiff [Nishimura] is the Chairman of the
Kauai County Committee of the Democratic Party of Hawaii.
 
4. Defendant [Williams] is a nominee in the
Republican primary election for the 14th District.
 
5. Scott T. Nago (Nago) is the State of Hawaii's
Chief Election Officer.
 
6. [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §] 12-3.
Nomination Papers; format; limitations. [sic] states in
part:
 
(a) No candidate's name shall be printed upon
any official ballot to be used at any primary, special
primary, or special election unless a nomination paper
was filed [on] the candidate's behalf and in the name
by which the candidate is commonly known. The
 
nomination paper shall be in a form prescribed and
provided by the chief election officer containing
substantially the following information:
 
.  .  .
 
(6)	 A sworn certification by self-subscribing
oath by the candidate that the candidate
qualifies under the law for the office the
candidate is seeking and that the
candidate has determined that, except for
the information provided by the registered
voters signing the nomination papers, all
of the information on the nomination
 papers is true and correct; 
(7)	 A sworn certification by self-subscribing
oath by a party candidate that the
candidate is a member of the party; 
.  .  .
 
(f) Nomination papers which are incomplete and
do not contain all of the certifications, signatures,
and requirements of this section shall be void and
will not be accepted for filing by the chief election
officer or clerk. (Emphas[e]s added.)
 
7.	 HRS [§] 12-7. Filing of oath., [sic] states in part:
 
The name of no candidate for any office shall be
printed upon any official ballot, in any election,
unless the candidate shall have taken and subscribed
 to the following written oath or affirmation, and
filed the oath with the candidate's nomination papers.
   .  .  .
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The oath or affirmation shall be subscribed before the
 
officer administering the same, who shall endorse
thereon the fact that the oath was subscribed and
 sworn to or the affirmation was made together with the
date thereof and affix the seal of the officer's
 office or of the court of which the officer is a judge
or clerk. It shall be the duty of every notary public
or other public officer by law authorized to
administer oaths to administer the oath or affirmation
 prescribed by this section and to furnish the required
endorsement and authentication. (Emphas[e]s added.)
 
8. Williams' nomination papers for the 14th
District were filed after the statutory filing deadline of
4:30 p.m., Tuesday, July 20, 2010.
 
9. Williams' nomination papers were allowed to be
filed after the statutory filing deadline by Nago based upon
David R. Hamman's (Hamman) July 19, 2010 alleged
"withdrawal" as a "candidate" for the 14th District.
 
10. On or about July 20, 2010, Nago allowed the
Republican Party three (3) additional days until 4:30 p.m.
on July 22, 2010 to file nomination papers for a
"replacement" nominee for the 14th District due to Hamman's
"withdrawal" on July 19, 2010 from the 14th District Primary
election.
 
11. On July 21, 2010 Williams obtained an
Application for Nomination Papers for the 14th District.
 
12. On July 22, 2010 at 8:15 a.m., Williams filed
his nomination papers to run in the Republican primary
election for the 14th District.
 
13. Williams' nomination papers were filed on
July 22, 2010 after the 4:30 p.m. July 20, 2010 statutory
deadline, pursuant to Nago's erroneous application and
interpretation of HRS [§] 12-1, et seq. and HRS [§] 11-117
and HRS [§] 11-118.
 
14. Nago's reliance on HRS [§] 11-117 and HRS
[§] 11-118 to allow the Republican Party three (3)
additional days to find a "replacement" candidate for Hamman
is wrong as a matter of law.
 
15. [Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) §] 3-172-1
defines a "candidate" as follows: 
"Candidate means an individual who has qualified for
placement on the ballot." (Emphasis added.)
 
16. Hamman was never a "candidate" for the 14th
 
District as defined by HAR [§] 3-172-1, and therefore could
not "withdraw," as Hamman never "qualified for placement on
the ballot."
 
17. On or about July 13, 2010, [Hamman] obtained an
Application for Nomination Papers for the 14th District.
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
18. On July 19, 2010 at approximately 11:00 a.m.
Hamman filed with the County of Kauai, Office of the County
Clerk, Elections Division (County Clerk), unsigned
nomination papers to run in the Primary election for the
14th District.
 
19. By letter dated "7/19/10" and containing the
time of "11:32 a.m.," which letter was received by the
County Clerk, Elections Division, on July 19, 2010, at 12:05
p.m., Hamman "withdrew" his unsigned nomination papers for
the 14th District.
 
20. Hamman's nomination papers for the 14th District
filed July 19, 2010 at 11:00 were incomplete as a matter of
law, as Hamman did not sign the "Certification by the
Partisan Candidate" as required by HRS [§] 12-3(a)(7).
 
21. Hamman's nomination papers for the 14th District
were incomplete as a matter of law, as Hamman did not sign
the Oath of Loyalty or Affirmation as required by HRS
[§] 12-7. 
22. Hamman's nomination papers filed on July 19,
2010 at 11:00 a.m. for the 14th District were incomplete, as
the nomination papers did not contain all of the
certifications, signatures and requirements of HRS [§] 12-3
and HRS [§] 12-7, and therefore are void as a matter of law
pursuant to HRS [§] 12-3(f) and HRS [§] 12-7.
 
23. Hamman's nomination papers for the 14th District
should not have been "accepted" for filing by the County
Clerk on July 19, 2010 as pursuant to HRS [§] 12-3(f) and
HRS [§] 12-7 the nomination papers were incomplete and void
as a matter of law.
 
24. On July 19, 2010 Hamman did not qualify as a
"candidate" and therefore could not "withdraw" his
 incomplete nomination papers which were null and void as a
matter of law.
 
25. At the time Hamman filed his nomination papers
for the 14th District, on July 19, 2010 at 11:00 a.m. Hamman
had no intention of running in the Republican primary
election for the 14[th] district.
 
26. At the time Hamman filed his nomination papers
for the 14th District, Hamman's only intent and purpose was
to attempt to create the appearance of a "vacancy" by his
"withdrawal" from the 14th District race, in an intentional
effort to create additional time to nominate a Republican
candidate for the primary election for the 14th District.
 
27. On July 19, 2010 at 12:05 p.m. Hamman obtained
an Application for Nomination Papers for the Republican
primary election for the State of Hawaii's Senate, Island of
Kauai, 7th District.
 
28. On July 19, 2010 at 12:31 p.m. Hamman filed his
signed nomination papers to run in the Republican Primary
election for the State Senate, 7th District.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Nishimura sought relief from the circuit court as
 
follows:
 
A. Declare that [Hamman's] incomplete nomination
papers should not have been "accepted" for filing on July
19, 2010 at 11:00 a.m. by the County of Kauai, Office of the
County Clerk, Elections Division, and in accordance with HRS
[§] 12-3(f) and HRS [§] 12-7 are void as a matter of law;
 
B. Declare that Hamman was never a candidate for
 
the 14th District, and therefore could not "withdraw," as
Hamman never qualified for "placement on the ballot";
 
C. Declare that at the time of the statutory close
of filing for the primary election on Tuesday, July 20, 2010
at 4:30 p.m. there were no valid nomination papers filed for
any person in the Republican Party for the 14th District;
 
D. Declare that the Chief election officer's
 
decision to allow an additional three (3) days for the
Republican Party to find a "replacement" due to [Hamman's]
"withdrawal" on July 19, 2010 is wrong as a matter of law,
as Hamman's nomination papers should not have been
"accepted" for filing on July 19, 2010, and were void as a
matter of law; [and]
 
E. Declare that [Williams'] nomination papers filed
on July 22, 2010 after the statutory filing deadline of 4:30
p.m. on July 20, 2010 for the primary election are null and
void, and [Williams] shall not be a candidate in the
District 14 Republican Primary Election[.]
 
In dismissing Nishimura's Verified Complaint, the
 
circuit court made the following Findings of Fact (FOFs) and
 
Conclusions of Law (COLs):
 
I. FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1.	 On July 19, 2010 at 11:00 a.m., [Hamman] filed
nomination papers to run as a Republican candidate for
State House of Representatives District 14[].
 
2.	 [Hamman] did not sign the oath of loyalty or
affirmation in his nomination papers for District 14.
However, the County Clerk accepted and filed the
nomination papers submitted by [Hamman].
 
3.	 Upon the County Clerk's acceptance and filing of
[Hamman's] nomination papers for District 14, [Hamman]
was an official candidate for District 14.
 
4.	 On July 19, 2010, at 12:05 p.m., [Hamman] withdrew his
nomination papers for the 14th District.
 
5.	 On July 19, 2010, at 12:31 p.m., [Hamman] filed
nomination papers to run as the Republican candidate
for the State Senate, Kauai.
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6.	 On July 20, 2010, Chief Election Officer [Nago], via
Lori Tomczyk, ballot operations, notified the
Republican Party that the Republican Party had three
(3) additional days, until 4:30 p.m. on July 22, 2010,
to notify the Chief Elections Officer of a replacement
candidate for the 14th District.
 
7.	 On July 21, 2010, the Hawaii Republican Party
notified, via email, the Elections Office of its
nomination of [Williams] as the replacement candidate
for the 14th District.
 
8.	 On July 22, 2010, at 8:15 a.m., [Williams] timely
filed his nomination papers to run as the Republican
candidate for the 14th District.
 
9.	 [Williams] is a candidate for the 14th District.
 
II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1.	 This Court has jurisdiction over this matter.
 
2.	 When the County Clerk accepted and filed the
nomination papers submitted by [Hamman] for the 14th
District, [Hamman] became an official candidate for
the 14th District.
 
3.	 [Hamman] appropriately withdrew his candidacy for the
14th District. See HRS [§] 11-117.
 
4.	 Once [Hamman] withdrew, the Chief Elections Officer
gave notice to the Republican Party to submit a
replacement candidate within the deadlines described
under HRS [§] 11-118(b).
 
5.	 The Republican Party submitted notice of the
replacement candidate, [Williams], to the Chief
Elections Officer via email within the allotted time
 frame of HRS [§] 11-118.
 
6.	 [Williams] timely filed his nomination papers as the
replacement candidate.
 
7.	 [Williams] is a candidate representing the Republican
Party for the office of State House of
Representatives, District 14.
 
On appeal, Nishimura contends FOFs 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9
 
are erroneous and COLs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are wrong. He
 
contends the circuit court erred in "finding and concluding" that 
(1) "upon the County Clerk's 'acceptance' on July 19, 2010 of
 
[Hamman's] unsigned nomination papers for the Republican primary
 
election for District 14, Hamman became an 'official candidate'"
 
and (2) "based upon Hamman's 'withdrawal' from the District 14
 
race on July 19, 2010, the Office of Elections was authorized
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to HRS [§] 11-117 and/or HRS [§] 11-118 to allow the
 
Republican Party three additional days to identify a
 
'replacement' candidate for the District 14 primary race."
 
II.
 
A.	 This case falls within the exception to the
mootness doctrine.
 
In Diamond v. State of Hawai' i, Bd. of Land & Natural 
Res.,
 112 Hawai' i 161, 145 P.3d 704 (2006), the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court stated that it has 
"repeatedly recognized an exception to the mootness doctrine
in cases involving questions that affect the public interest
and are 'capable of repetition yet evading review.'" Okada 
Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 99 Hawai' i 191, 
196, 53 P.3d 799, 804 (2002) (citations omitted). In Okada,
[the supreme court] stated: 
Among the criteria considered in determining the
existence of the requisite degree of public interest
are the public or private nature of the question
presented, the desirability of an authoritative
determination for the future guidance of public
officers, and the likelihood of future recurrence of
the question. The phrase, "capable of repetition, yet
evading review," means that a court will not dismiss a
case on the grounds of mootness where a challenged
governmental action would evade full review because
the passage of time would prevent any single plaintiff
from remaining subject to the restriction complained
of for the period necessary to complete the lawsuit.
 
Id. at 196-97, 53 P.3d at 804-05 (citations, quotation
signals, and block quotation format omitted).
 
Id. at 170, 145 P.3d 713; see also McCabe Hamilton & Renny Co. v.
 
Chung, 98 Hawai' i 107, 43 P.3d 244 (Haw. App. 2002). 
The instant case falls squarely within this mootness
 
exception.
 
B.	 The circuit court erred in concluding that upon
the County Clerk's acceptance of Hamman's unsigned
nomination papers for the Republican primary
election for District 14, Hamman became an
official candidate.
 
HRS Chapter 12 (Primary Elections), § 12-1 (2009 Repl.)
 
titled "Application of chapter," provides that "[a]ll candidates
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for elective office, except as provided in section 14-21, shall
 
be nominated in accordance with this chapter and not otherwise." 
HRS § 12-3 (2009 Repl.), titled "Nomination Papers;
 
format; limitations," provides in part:
 
(a) No candidate's name shall be printed upon any
official ballot to be used at any primary, special primary,
or special election unless a nomination paper was filed [on]
the candidate's behalf and in the name by which the
candidate is commonly known. The nomination paper shall be
in a form prescribed and provided by the chief election
officer containing substantially the following information:
 
. . . .
 
(6)	 A sworn certification by self-subscribing oath
by the candidate that the candidate qualifies
under the law for the office the candidate is
 seeking and that the candidate has determined
that, except for the information provided by the
registered voters signing the nomination papers,
all of the information on the nomination papers
is true and correct; 
(7)	 A sworn certification by self-subscribing oath
by a party candidate that the candidate is a
member of the party; 
. . . . 
(f) Nomination papers which are incomplete and do
not contain all of the certifications, signatures, and
requirements of this section shall be void and will not be
accepted for filing by the chief election officer or clerk.
 
HRS § 12-7 (2009 Repl.), titled "Filing of oath,"
 
provides in part:
 
The name of no candidate for any office shall be
printed upon any official ballot, in any election, unless
the candidate shall have taken and subscribed to the
 following written oath or affirmation, and filed the oath
with the candidate's nomination papers.
 
. . . . 
The oath or affirmation shall be subscribed before the
 
officer administering the same, who shall endorse thereon
the fact that the oath was subscribed and sworn to or the
 affirmation was made together with the date thereof and
affix the seal of the officer's office or of the court of
 which the officer is a judge or clerk. 
It shall be the duty of every notary public or other
public officer by law authorized to administer oaths to
administer the oath or affirmation prescribed by this
section and to furnish the required endorsement and
authentication.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hamman did not sign the "Certification by the Partisan
 
Candidate," as mandated by § 12-3(a)(7), and either the "Oath of
 
Loyalty" or the "Affirmation," as mandated by § 12-7.
 
The nomination papers "filed" by Hamman on July 19,
 
2010 contain a warning to a nominee that stated:
 
NOTICE: Pursuant to State law nomination papers that are
incomplete and/or nomination papers that have
been altered by anyone other than the Chief
Election Officer or the County Clerk will not be
accepted for filing.
 
Hamman's incomplete nomination papers were void on
 
their face, and the County Clerk had no authority to "accept" the
 
nomination papers. HRS § 12-3(f). Therefore, Hamman did not
 
become an official candidate for the 14th District.
 
In Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai' i 337, 198 P.3d 124 
(2008), the Hawai' i Supreme Court in deciding an election contest 
complaint stated that "[w]here the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous that a specific time provision must be met, it is 
mandatory and not merely directory." Id. at 339, 198 P.3d 126 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
HRS §§ 12-3(f) and 12-7 are plain and unambiguous. 
Because these two sections are unambiguous, their plain language
 must be construed as mandatory and not merely directory. Section
 
§ 12-3(f) provides that nomination papers that are "incomplete
 
and do not contain all of the certifications, signatures, and
 
requirements of this section shall be void and will not be
 
accepted for filing by the chief election officer or clerk." 
Section 12-7 prohibits the name of any candidate from being
 
printed upon any official ballot, unless "the candidate shall
 
have taken and subscribed to the following written oath or
 
affirmation, and filed the oath with the candidate's nomination
 
papers." 
Hamman failed to sign the "Certification by the
 
Partisan Candidate" and either the "Oath of Loyalty" or the 
"Affirmation." The circuit court erred in concluding the County
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Clerk could legally accept and file Hamman's nomination papers. 
Section 12-3(f) prohibited the County Clerk from doing so.
 
C.	 The circuit court erred in concluding that based
upon Hamman's withdrawal from the District 14 race
on July 19, 2010, the Office of Elections was
authorized pursuant to HRS § 11-117 (2009 Repl.)
and § 11-118 (2009 Repl.) to allow the Republican
Party three additional days to identify a
replacement candidate for the District 14 primary
race.
 
The circuit court erred in concluding that based upon
 
Hamman's "withdrawal" from the District 14 race on July 19, 2010,
 
the Office of Elections was authorized pursuant to HRS § 11-117
 
and/or § 11-118 to allow the Republican Party three additional
 
days to identify a "replacement" candidate for the District 14
 
primary race. Hamman could not withdraw his nomination papers as
 
the papers were void and should never have been accepted and
 
filed by the County Clerk. Therefore, HRS §§ 11-117 and 11-118
 
were not applicable, and the Office of Elections had no authority
 
to give the Republican Party additional days to identify a
 
replacement candidate. Without these additional days, Williams'
 
nomination papers were filed after the statutory deadline of
 
Tuesday, July 20, 2010, at 4:30 p.m., and his name should not
 
have been on the ballot.
 
III.
 
Therefore, the Final Judgment filed on September 14,
 
2010 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.
 
On the opening brief:
 
Harold Bronstein
 
for Plaintiff-Appellant.
