SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal, Appellee-Appellant Patricia
 
E.G. Adams, in her capacity as the Administrator of the Estate of
 
Brent Adams (Adams), appeals from the September 10, 2010 Final
 
Judgment in Favor of Appellant-Appellee Hawaii Medical Service
 
Association (HMSA) entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
Adams contends that the Circuit Court erred when it 
concluded the Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner) had no 
jurisdiction to award Adams's attorney's fees and costs incurred 
in defending her judgment in Hawai' i Medical Service Ass'n v. 
Adams, 120 Hawai' i 446, 209 P.3d 1260 (App. 2009) (Adams I).

After a careful review of the issues raised by the
 
parties, the record and the applicable authority, we resolve
 
Adams's point on appeal as follows.
 
The Circuit Court erred when it ruled the Commissioner
 
"lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue the Second Order
 
Awarding Attorneys' Fees and Costs, filed December 28, 2009
 
("Second Fee Order" ) such that the Second Fee Order was void ab
 
initio[.]"
 
"Subject matter jurisdiction is concerned with whether 
the court has the power to hear a case." Hawaii Mgmt. Alliance 
Ass'n v. Ins. Comm'r, 106 Hawai' i 21, 27, 100 P.3d 952, 958 
(2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Adams 
filed the subject request for fees and costs with the 
Commissioner in the same proceeding in which the Commissioner 
conducted his external review, HER-07-13457. Hawaii Revised 
2
Statutes (HRS) 432E-6(e) (2005)  permits an enrollee of a health
benefit plan to be "allowed, at the commissioner's discretion, an
 
award of a reasonable sum for attorney's fees and reasonable
 
costs incurred in connection with the external review . . . ." 
HRS § 432E-6(e).
3 Thus, the statute, on its face, gave the
 
Commissioner the authority to award attorney's fees in connection
 with the external review and the Commissioner had the power to
 
make such an award.
 
The terseness of the Circuit Court's ruling leaves us
 
to guess at the basis for the ruling. However, during the
 
Circuit Court's oral ruling, it stated that it lacked subject
 
matter jurisdiction "over this case" and that the Commissioner
 
"also lacked jurisdiction" to rule on Adams's December 3, 2009
 
motion for fees and costs.
 
2
 HRS § 432E-6 has since been repealed and replaced by Part IV of
the Patients' Bill of Rights, HRS §§ 432E-31 through -44 by Act 230 § 10
(2011) to comply with the requirements of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act of 2010, Public Law No. 111-148. However, the repeal of
HRS § 432E-6 does not affect our analysis of the issue presented in this
appeal.

As to the former, the Circuit Court appeared to rely on 
Standard Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 99 Hawai' i 125, 53 P.3d 264 (App. 
2001), for the proposition that when a reviewing court remands a 
case with specific instructions, "the trial court is powerless to 
undertake any proceedings beyond those specified therein." Id., 
at 137, 53 P.3d at 276. While it is true that the mandate in 
4
Adams I was specific,  the Circuit Court was presiding over
HMSA's appeal from the Second Fee Order, in Civ. No. 10-1-0101,
 
and not presiding over the remand of Adams I in Civ. No. 07-1­
0918.5 As a result, Standard Management did not apply. 
With regard to the Commissioner's jurisdiction, the
 
Circuit Court ruled that the only tribunal with jurisdiction over
 
the case after the remand in Adams I was the circuit court, and
 
there was "no jurisdictional basis" for the Commissioner to
 
consider Adams's December 3, 2009 motion for fees and costs. The
 
Circuit Court did not reveal any reason why it did not consider
 
the authority contained in HRS § 432E-6(e) as authorizing the
 
Commissioner's consideration of a request for fees incurred in
 
6
the recently completed  appeal in Adams I. 
Nor is one apparent from this record. HRS 432E-6(e),
 
does not set a time limit for the fee request. Moreover, it
 would have been impracticable, if not impossible, to submit a
 
request--that must pass a reasonableness test--in advance of the
 
proceedings for which they would be incurred. Thus, the Circuit
 
4
 In Adams I, we instructed, "the Judgment filed on November 13,
2007 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is vacated, and this case is
remanded to the circuit court with instructions to reverse the 'Findings ofFact, Conclusions of Law, Discussion and Order' and enter judgment on behalfof HMSA." Adams I, 120 Hawai' i at 457, 209 P.3d at 1271.

 We take judicial notice of the files and records in Civil No. 07­
1-0918 and note that Judgment on remand in Adams I was entered on August 17,
2009, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit Court, Judge Eden Elizabeth
Hifo presiding. 
6
 We also take judicial notice of the files and records in Appeals
No. 28899, which reveals that judgment on appeal was entered on June 10, 2009and the Hawai' i Supreme Court rejected Adams's application for certiorari on
October 23, 2009, making the judgment effective as of the latter date.Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 36(c)(2)(A).

Court's suggestion that the request should have been made before
 
the appeal in Adams I was taken was not supported by the language
 
of the statute nor was it practicable. 
In making his decision to award fees for the Adam's
 
appeal, the Commissioner reasoned,
 
There is nothing in HRS §432E-6(e) that expressly limits an
award to attorneys' fees and costs relating only to the
administrative hearing. Indeed, HRS §432E-6(a)(4) provides
for a review hearing "pursuant to chapter 91". Because HRS
 chapter 91, the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act,
contemplates appeals to the judicial system, it indicates
that the Hawaii State Legislature contemplated that the
Commissioner could award attorneys' fees and costs for
appeals in appropriate circumstances. The plain meaning of
the words "in connection with" is broad enough to encompass
appeals from an external review. If the Legislature had
intended to restrict the award of attorneys' fees to the
external review it could have simply said "incurred in the
external review" instead of "in connection with the external
 review." But it did not. In addition, the failure to award
attorneys['] fees on appeal could create an incentive for a
managed care plan to routinely appeal with the idea that a
plaintiff cannot afford to defend the appeal, causing the
managed care plan to win by default. If this happened, it
could thwart the legislative purpose of the external review
statute by creating a disincentive for a managed care plan
enrollee to even request an external review in the first
place.
 
We conclude that the statutory language "in connection
 
with the external review" is ambiguous as to whether it
 
encompasses judicial review of an external review decision. The
 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has stated that an appellate court 
generally reviews questions of statutory interpretation de 
novo, 'Olelo v. Office of Info. Practices, 116 Hawai' i 337,
344, 173 P.3d 484, 491 (2007), but, "[i]n the case of . . .
ambiguous statutory language, the applicable standard ofreview regarding an agency's interpretation of its owngoverning statute requires this court to defer to theagency's expertise and to follow the agency's constructionof the statute unless that construction is palpablyerroneous," Vail v. Employees' Ret. Sys., 75 Haw. 42, 66,856 P.2d 1227, 1240 (1993). 
Gillan v. Gov't Employees Ins. Co., 119 Hawai' i 109, 114, 194 
P.3d 1071, 1076 (2008). The Circuit Court did not identify any
 
authority for its determination that the Commissioner could not
 
exercise the authority contained in HRS §432E-6(e) and
 
4

consequently, did not rule on whether the Commissioner's
 
interpretation of the statute was "palpably erroneous." 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the September 10,
 
2010 Final Judgment in Favor of Appellant Hawaii Medical Service
 
Association entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit and
 
remand for further proceedings consistent with this summary
 
disposition order.
