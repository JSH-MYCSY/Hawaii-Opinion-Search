Defendant-Appellant Guillermo Martinez (Martinez)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on
 
September 2, 2010 in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 
Puna Division (district court).1
 
The district court found Martinez guilty of Criminal
 
Property Damage in the Fourth Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 708-823(1) (Supp. 2010).

testified that Martinez was not at the scene when the crime was

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
conclude that Martinez's appeal is without merit. The record 
does not contain any written notice by Martinez regarding alibi 
witnesses. There is nothing in the record to show that Martinez 
complied with Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 12.1(a) and 
(b). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on September 2, 2010 in the District Court of
 the Third Circuit, Puna Division, is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 23, 2012.
