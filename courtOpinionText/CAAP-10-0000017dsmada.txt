v. 
JOSEPH VAIMILI, Defendant-Appellee
 
and
 FREEDOM BAIL BOND, Surety-Movant/Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0410)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Surety/Appellant Freedom Bail Bonds’

 
(Appellant Freedom Bail Bonds) November 29, 2010 motion for
 
temporary remand and (2) the record, it appears that we do not
 have jurisdiction over Appellant Freedom Bail Bonds' appeal from
 the August 16, 2010 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Order Denying Freedom Bail Bond's Motion to Set Aside Judgment 
and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond" issued by the Circuit Court 
1
of the First Circuit  (the August 16, 2010 order), becauseAppellant Freedom Bail Bonds' appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The statute that authorizes most appeals from circuit court criminal matters is Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (Supp. 2009), which provides that "[a]ny party deeming oneself aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602 in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-11. That provision does not apply to this appeal, however, because a proceeding involving the "forfeiture of a bond is a civil proceeding." State v. 
Camara, 81 Hawai
'i 324, 329 n.7, 916 P.2d 1225, 1230 n.7 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The supreme court has explained that the statute authorizing an appeal from a bail forfeiture proceeding is HRS § 804-51 (Supp. 2009), and 
the appealable event is the order denying the motion to set
aside the judgment of forfeiture.
Once a motion to set aside is denied, the surety may
appeal such denial as in the case of a final judgment.Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
4(a)(1), a notice of appeal from a final judgment must befiled within thirty days from the date of entry of thejudgment - in this case, thirty days from the order denyingthe motion to set aside. 
State v. Camara, 81 Hawai 'i at 329, 916 P.2d at 1230 (footnote 
omitted). The August 16, 2010 order denies Appellant Freedom

Bail Bonds' motion to set aside the bail forfeiture regarding
 
Defendant-Appellee Joseph Vaimili, and, thus, HRS § 804-51
 authorizes an appeal from the August 16, 2010 order.
 
An appeal, however, must be timely in order to be 
valid. The supreme court has held that, in an appeal from a ruling in a bail bond forfeiture proceeding, "HRAP [Rule] 4(a), as opposed to HRAP [Rule] 4(b), applies because forfeiture of a bond is a civil proceeding." State v. Camara, 81 Hawai
'i at 
329 n.7, 916 P.2d at 1230 n.7 (citation omitted). Thus, the rules governing civil proceedings control this case. "When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). 
Appellant Freedom Bail Bonds did not file its September
 
16, 2010 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the
 August 16, 2010 order, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required, and, thus,
 Appellant Freedom Bail Bonds' appeal is untimely. The failure to
 file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.

Accordingly,

 Because we lack jurisdiction and dismiss this appeal, we do not
address Appellant’s November 29, 2010 motion for temporary remand.
