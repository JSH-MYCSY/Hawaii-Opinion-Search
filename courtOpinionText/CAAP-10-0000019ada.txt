OCTOBER 1, 2010 MOTION FOR DISMISSAL OF APPEAL

Upon review of (1) Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellee
 
Douglas H. Drake's (Appellee Drake) October 1, 2010 motion to
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-10-0000019, and (2) the 
record, it appears that we have jurisdiction over Defendants/ Appellants/Cross-Appellees Earl Kamakahanohano Leslie Gaspar and Diana Roberta Danmeyer Gaspar’s (the Gaspar Appellants) appeal from the October 20, 2010 judgment of foreclosure issued by the 
1
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)  pursuant to
Hawaii Revised Statutes § 667-51(a)(1) (Supp. 2009), but we lack jurisdiction over Defendants/Appellees/Cross-Appellants Franklin Paul Embernate and Leilani Pauline Embernate's (the Embernate Cross-Appellants) cross-appeal from the October 20, 2010 judgment of foreclosure because the Embernate Cross-Appellants' cross-appeal is untimely under Rule 4.1(b)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
The October 20, 2010 judgment of foreclosure is an
 
appealable judgment pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(1). "When a
 civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be
 filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable
 order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The Gaspar Appellants filed their
 September 13, 2010 notice of appeal after the Circuit Court
 announced its decision, but before entry of the October 20, 2010
 judgment of foreclosure. Nevertheless, "[i]f a notice of appeal
 is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of the
 judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed
 immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes final
 for the purpose of appeal." HRAP Rule 4(a)(2). Accordingly, the
 Gaspar Defendants' appeal is timely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2), and

we have jurisdiction over the Gaspar Appellants' appeal pursuant 
to HRS § 667-51(a)(1). 
With respect to the timeliness of the Embernate Cross-
Appellants' cross-appeal, however, "[t]he cross-appellant shall
 file with the clerk of the court appealed from a notice of cross-
appeal and pay the filing fee within 14 days after the notice of
 appeal is served on the cross-appellant, or within the time
 prescribed for filing the notice of appeal, whichever is later." 
HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1). In the instant case, the later of these two
 time periods is the thirty-day time prescribed for filing the
 notice of appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The Embernate Cross-
Appellants did not file their November 23, 2010 notice of cross-
appeal within thirty days after entry of the October 20, 2010
 judgment of foreclosure, as HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1) requires. 
Therefore, the Embernate Cross-Appellants’ cross-appeal is
 untimely under HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1). The failure to file a timely
 notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
 that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot
 disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v.
 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule
 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change
 the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the
 HRAP]."). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction over the Embernate
 Cross-Appellants’ cross-appeal. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we grant in part and deny in
 
part the October 1, 2010 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 number CAAP-10-0000019 in that we dismiss the Embernate Cross­

Appellants’ cross-appeal. The parties shall proceed with the
 
briefing for the Gaspar Appellants' appeal according to HRAP
 Rule 28.
