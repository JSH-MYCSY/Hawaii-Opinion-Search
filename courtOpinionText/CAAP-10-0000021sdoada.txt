OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
WINGED FOOT INVESTMENTS, INC., a Maryland Corporation
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MARVIN JONES, JOHN and MARY DOES 1-20 and DOE PARTNERSHIPS,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0122)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Marvin Jones (Jones) appeals from
 
the "Rule 54(b) Final Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff Winged Foot
 
Investments, Inc. and Against Marvin Jones as to Ejectment
 
Claim," filed on October 14, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the
 
Third Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On April 12, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellant Winged Foot 
Investments, Inc. (Winged Foot) filed a Complaint for Ejectment 
against Jones. Winged Foot alleged inter alia that: on 
February 16, 2010, Eastern Savings Bank, FSB (Eastern) conducted 
a foreclosure under power of sale of 13-3405 Maile Street, Pahoa, 
Hawai'i 96778 (Property); that on February 18, 2010, a

Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Sale Pursuant to Power of 
Sale was recorded in the State of Hawai' i, Bureau of Conveyances 
as Document No. 2010-022498 (which stated that Eastern was the successful bidder for the Property); and that on March 10, 2010, 
a deed conveying the Property to Winged Foot was recorded as 
Document No. 2010-032382. 
Winged Foot alleged in the Complaint for Ejectment that
 
Jones occupied the Property without permission and had no right,
 
title, or interest to the Property. Winged Foot prayed for a
 
judgment and decree that it owned the Property and for a Writ of
 
Ejectment or a Writ of Possession. 
On June 24, 2010, Winged Foot filed a Motion for
 
Partial Summary Judgment. On August 26, 2010, the Circuit Court
 
issued an Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary
 
Judgment and a separate Writ of Ejectment.
 
On appeal, Jones claims that the Circuit Court erred by
 
granting Winged Foot's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
 
because Winged Foot lacks standing to eject Jones, asserting that
 
the underlying non-judicial foreclosure sale from which Winged
 
Foot derives its interest in the Property failed to comply with
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 667-5 to 667-10. Jones argues
 
that the non-judicial foreclosure and sale was void because
 
Eastern failed to make a required downpayment pursuant to
 
HRS § 667-5.7, and instead, made a credit bid. Jones also argues
 
that there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude
 
summary judgment.

We resolve Jones' arguments as follows:
 (1) Eastern's non-judicial foreclosure sale was not
 
void because Eastern made a credit bid rather than a downpayment. 
2 The fly-leaf to documents filed in the appellate courts shall have a 3
inch top margin. Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), Rule 32(a).
Keoni K. Agard and Dexter K. Kaiama, counsel for Defendant-Appellant and
Francis P. Hogan and Gary P. Quiming, counsel for Plaintiff-Appellee, are
cautioned that failure to comply with HRAP Rule 32(a) in the future may result
in sanctions.

The plain language of HRS § 667-5.7 (Supp. 2010) states that "the
 
successful bidder . . . shall not be required to make a
 
downpayment . . . of more than ten percent of the highest
 
successful bid price." HRS § 667-5.7 sets a limitation on the
 
downpayment that can be demanded. This provision does not
 
require the successful bidder to make a downpayment or preclude a
 
mortgagee from making a credit bid. See Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass'n
 
v. Siangco, No. CAAP-10-0000110, 2011 WL 3849841 (App. Aug. 31,
 2011) (SDO). Therefore, Jones' claim, that Winged Foot lacked
 
standing to seek ejectment of Jones because the non-judicial
 
foreclosure was void, is without merit.
 
(2) Jones did not raise any valid defense to Winged
 
Foot's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Therefore, there is
 
no genuine issue of material fact and Winged Foot was entitled to
 
partial summary judgment on its ejectment claim as a matter of
 
law.
 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Rule 54(b) Final Judgment
 
in Favor of Plaintiff Winged Foot Investments, Inc. and Against
 Marvin Jones as to Ejectment Claim filed October 14, 2010 in the
 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
