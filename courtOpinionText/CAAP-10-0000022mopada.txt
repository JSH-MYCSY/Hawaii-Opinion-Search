NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee For the
 
Certificateholders of Soundview Home Loan Trust 2007-OPT4, Asset-
Backed Certificates, Series 2007-OPT4 (Wells Fargo).
 
On appeal, Markley contends the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact
 
remained as to whether Markley had been provided with the Notice
 
of Right to Cancel forms required under the federal Truth-in-
Lending Act (the TILA), 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635 (1995).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In consideration of a loan made by Option One Mortgage
 
Corporation (OOMC) to Markely in the principal sum of
 
$825,000.00, Markley executed a promissory note and a first
 
mortgage (mortgage), both dated July 12, 2007, in favor of OOMC. 
On February 5, 2010, Markely attempted to cancel the mortgage by
 
sending a letter to both OOMC and Wells Fargo.
 
On February 18, 2010, Wells Fargo filed a complaint
 
against Markley to foreclose the mortgage. Markley filed her
 
answer on March 17, 2010.
 
Wells Fargo filed a Motion for Summary Judgment as
 
Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of
 
Foreclosure (MSJ) on March 31, 2010. On April 13, 2010, Markely
 
filed her memorandum in opposition, in which she argued that the
 
mortgage was void and unenforceable under TILA because Markley
 
had not been provided with two copies of the Notice of Right to
 
Cancel.
 
The circuit court held a hearing on the MSJ on June 2,
 
2010. On July 14, 2010, the circuit court issued its
 
FOF/COL/Order and the Judgment.
 
On July 26, 2010, Markley filed a "Motion for
 
Reconsideration of the Court's Order Granting Motion for Summary
 
Judgment as Against all Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree
 
of Foreclosure Filed July 14, 2010." The circuit court denied
 
Markley's motion for reconsideration on September 13, 2010. 
Markley timely appealed.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
The appellate courts review "the circuit court's grant
 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107
 
Hawaifi 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. 
Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawaif i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). 
The Hawaif i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Querubin, 107 Hawaif i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawaif i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Markley contends the mortgage was timely cancelled and
 
is void and unenforceable under federal law because she was not
 
provided with two copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel. 
Markley correctly argues that Wells Fargo did not present
 
sufficient evidence for the circuit court to hold that there
 
existed no genuine issues of material fact as to whether two
 
copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel were received by Markley.
 
Under TILA, "[t]he creditor shall clearly and
 
conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the
 
Board, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section
 
the rights of the obligor [to rescind.]" 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(a). 
Furthermore, a creditor is required to "deliver two copies of the
 
notice of the right to rescind to each consumer entitled to
 
rescind." 12 C.F.R. ยง 226.23 (b)(1) (2009). If the required
 
disclosures are not made, the borrower's right of rescission
 
expires "three years after the date of consummation of the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs
 
first." 15 U.S.C. ยง 1635(f).
 
Wells Fargo argues that the affidavit of Settlement
 
Agent Joan Jones, which declared that Markley had received two
 
copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel, is ample evidence to
 
disprove Markley's contention that the mortgage was timely
 
canceled. Markley stated in an April 13, 2010 declaration that
 
she did not receive two copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel.
 
"The case law of other jurisdictions is well settled 
that a debtor's affidavit averring non-delivery is sufficient to 
create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the 
statutory presumption had been rebutted, thereby precluding 
summary judgment with respect to a claim based upon a debtor's 
assertion of non-delivery." Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. 
Keka, 94 Hawaif i 213, 224, 11 P.3d 1, 12 (2000) (citing to Stone 
v. Mehlberg, 728 F. Supp. 1341, 1353-54 (W.D. Mich. 1989 & Supp. 
Opinion 1990); Powers v. Sims & Levin Realtors, 396 F. Supp. 12, 
22-23 (E.D. Va. 1975), aff'd in part and denied in part, 542 F.2d 
1216 (4th Cir. 1976); Cintron v. Bankers Trust Co., 682 So. 2d 
616, 616-17 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996); Award Lumber & Constr. 
Co. v. Humphries, 441 N.E.2d 1190, 1191-92 (Ill. App. Ct. 1982)). 
The court in Keka went on to hold that a debtor's declaration 
that the debtor never received two copies of the Notice of Right 
to Cancel "raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
the [creditor] timely provided the [debtor] with the disclosures 
required by TILA." Keka, 94 Hawaif i at 225, 11 P.3d at 13. 
Wells Fargo attempts to distinguish the present case 
from Keka by arguing that the affidavit of Joan Jones is stronger 
evidence that Markley received the Notice of Right to Cancel than 
was present in Keka. However, Keka did not focus on the strength 
or quality of evidence presented by the creditor, but rather 
focused on whether the debtor's claims raised a genuine issue of 
material fact. See Keka, 94 Hawaif i at 225, 11 P.3d at 13. 
As stated earlier, when reviewing the grant or denial
 
of a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence must be viewed
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the light most favorable to the non-moving party." Querubin, 
107 Hawaif i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697. In the instant case, Markley 
claims she never received two copies of the Notice of Right to 
Cancel. If true, these allegations would establish that the 
mortgage was subject to recision. Markley's declaration raises 
genuine issues of material facts; accordingly, the circuit court 
erred in granting the MSJ. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Judgment filed on July 14, 2010 in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit is hereby vacated, and this case is
 
remanded to the circuit court.
