IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
KNUD LINDGARD, Plaintiff-Appellant,
and
 
COLETTE ANDREE LINDGARD, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
RESIDUARY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP and KANEOHE RANCH COMPANY, LTD.,
Defendants-Appellees.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 02-1-0439)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Knud Lindgard (Lindgard), appearing
 
pro se
, appeals from the Final Judgment (Final Judgment) filed on
 
September 1, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(circuit court).1 Final Judgment was entered in favor of
 
Residuary Limited Partnership (Residuary) and Kaneohe Ranch
 Company, Ltd. (Kaneohe Ranch) (collectively Defendants), and
 against Lindgard, as to all claims raised in Lindgard's complaint
 in accordance with the Order Granting Defendants' Motion for
 Summary Judgment, filed on December 22, 2009.
2 The claims in
 
this case pertain to residential property (the Property) that the
 Lindgards leased from Kaneohe Ranch in 1970.

 Colette Andree Lindgard was named as a plaintiff in the complaint but
subsequently dismissed her claims. She is not party to this appeal.

Lindgard's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. However, 
noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28 does not always result in dismissal of an appeal. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 
496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012). Where possible, litigants are afforded the opportunity to have their cases addressed on the merits. Id. 
The majority of Lindgard's arguments on appeal address
 
issues that were litigated in two other cases –- S.P. No. 01-1­0204 and Civil No. 03-1-0607 –- and which are outside the scope
 of this appeal.
3 In particular, Lindgard asks this court to
 
approve and recognize a real estate appraisal conducted by his
 chosen appraiser and to reverse an arbitration award which was
 previously confirmed by the circuit court and affirmed by this
 court. We will not address these issues because they are not
 germane to the Final Judgment from which Lindgard appeals in this
 case.
 
This case instead arises from Civil No. 02-1-0439, in
 
which Lindgard filed a complaint on February 20, 2002, asserting
 five counts against the Defendants for: fraudulent
 representations regarding the presence of Chlordane on the
 Property (count I); fraudulent representations regarding the
 presence of fill on the Property (count II); material breach of
 implied warranties of habitability and fitness for use (count
 III); mistake of fact (count IV); and punitive damages (count V).

 See Kaneohe Ranch Co. v. Lindgard, 106 Hawai' i 516, 107 P.3d 1189,
No. 25358 2005 WL 639714 (App. Mar. 18, 2005) (SDO) (in regard to S.P. No. 01­
1-0204, affirming the circuit court's order confirming an arbitration awardthat determined net annual ground lease rent for the Property); Lindgard v.Residuary Ltd. P'ship, 113 Hawai' i 159, 149 P.3d 811, No. 26258 and 26612 2006
WL 3804416 (App. Dec. 27, 2006) (mem.) (2006 Lindgard Decision) (ruling, inter 
alia, that the circuit court properly determined that the Lindgards were
delinquent in unpaid lease rent and that Residuary was entitled to possessionof the Property). The 2006 Lindgard Decision dealt with both Civil No.03-1­0607 and this case, Civil No. 02-1-0439.

This is the second appeal related to Civil No. 02-1­
0439. In the first appeal, this court vacated the circuit 
court's judgment for the Defendants which was based on a determination that Lindgard's claims were barred by a two-year statute of limitations. Lindgard v. Residuary Ltd. P'ship, 113 
Hawai'i 159, 149 P.3d 811, No. 26258 and 26612 2006 WL 3804416 
(App. Dec. 27, 2006) (mem.) (2006 Lindgard Decision). We determined instead that Counts I and II of the Lindgards' complaint were subject to a six year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4) (1993). Id. at *7. For Counts III and IV, we 
determined that "the circuit court incorrectly held that the two-year statute of limitations prescribed by HRS §§ 657-7 or 657-8" applied because the claims were "couched in contract and did not seek compensation for damages arising from injury to persons or property, or construction to improve real property." Id. Count 
V, we determined, was subject to the statute of limitations for the other Counts. Id. 
On remand, the Defendants filed another motion for
 
summary judgment, which was granted by the circuit court. After
 the circuit court entered Final Judgment, this appeal followed. 
To the limited extent that it relates to this case, we discern
 from Lindgard's opening and reply briefs that he generally
 contests the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor
 of Defendants.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we conclude that
 Lindgard's appeal lacks merit and we resolve his appeal as
 follows.
 
We review "the circuit court's grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai' i 48, 
56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005). 
Count I of Lindgard's complaint alleges that when the
 
Lindgards accepted an assignment of the lease for the Property in
 1970, Kaneohe Ranch failed to disclose to them that the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Property's soil was contaminated by Chlordane, the presence of
 
which allegedly endangered the safety of the Lindgards and their
 pets, and caused them harm. The Lindgards claimed that they
 would not have accepted the assignment of lease if they had been
 aware of the presence of the contamination. 
Count II alleges that when the Lindgards accepted the
 
assignment of the lease to the Property in 1970, Kaneohe Ranch
 failed to disclose that the soil on the Property was unstable
 canal fill that could not support the building and structures on
 the Property. The complaint alleges structural problems due to
 the soil.
 
Count III alleges that the presence of Chlordane and
 
fill on the Property constituted a malicious and intentional
 breach of Kaneohe Ranch's implied warranties of habitability and
 fitness for use of the Property. 
Count IV sought to rescind the lease assignment on the
 
basis that there had been a mistake of fact and, hence, no
 meeting of the minds because the Lindgards were unaware of the
 presence of Chlordane or fill on the Property. 
All of Lindgard's claims are based on his contentions
 
that the Property was contaminated by Chlordane and/or that the
 soil was unstable due to the presence of fill. Based on the 2006
 Lindgard Decision, a six year statute of limitations applies for
 counts I through IV.
4 Given the evidence adduced by the
 
Defendants in support of their summary judgment motion on remand,
 and there having been no counter evidence submitted by Lindgard,
 there is no genuine issue of material fact that the statute of
 limitations expired by the time Lindgard filed his complaint on
 February 20, 2002.
 
4
 Although the 2006 Lindgard Decision did not expressly state that a
six year statute of limitations period applied to counts III and IV, this
court concluded that those counts sounded in contract. Therefore, we apply
the six year limitations period set forth in HRS § 657-1(1) (1993).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We apply the discovery rule to determine when a statute 
of limitations begins to run. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Newtown Meadows v. Venture 15, Inc., 115 Hawai' i 232, 277, 167 
P.3d 225, 270 (2007); Buck v. Miles, 89 Hawai' i 244, 250, 971 
P.2d 717, 723 (1999); Yamaguchi v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 65 Haw. 84, 
648 P.2d 689 (1982). "Under the discovery rule, a plaintiff need only have factual knowledge of the elements necessary for an actionable claim."  Buck, 89 Hawai' i at 250, 971 P.2d at 723. 
The statute of limitations begins to run "the moment [the] plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection between the former and the latter." Id. at 249, 971 P.2d at 722 (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted). 
In support of their summary judgment motion, the
 
Defendants submitted the deposition testimony of Lindgard which
 established that Lindgard contacted an attorney at the latest in
 1993 because of health problems he believed were caused by the
 presence of contamination on the Property. With regard to the
 alleged fill and instability of the soil, Lindgard's deposition
 testimony establishes that he informed a representative of
 Kaneohe Ranch in 1990 that there were cracks in his house that
 were caused by the condition of the soil. Lindgard's deposition
 testimony also shows that in 1993, a water pipe on the Property
 broke and an employee of the Board of Water Supply told Lindgard
 it was due to movement of the pipe. A few days later, a nearby
 City water line broke due to ground movement and when the Board
 of Water Supply dug a trench to repair the line, Lindgard saw
 that there were different kinds of clay in the soil.
 
Therefore, based on the uncontested evidence in this
 
case, by 1993, Lindgard had discovered or should have discovered
 the alleged acts, damages, and causation related to his claims. 
Thus, the statute of limitations for all of his claims was
 triggered no later than 1993. Lindgard did not file his
 complaint until February 2002, which at a minimum was nine years
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
after the statute of limitations began to run. His claims are
 
thus barred.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Final Judgment
 
entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on September 1,
 2010 is affirmed.
