APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 07-1-1120)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sami Tamman (Sami) appeals from the
 
"Order Regarding Motion for Reconsideration of Order Entered on
 
July 8, 2010 or in the Alternative Motion for New Trial and/or
 
Reopening of the Hearing" (Motion for Reconsideration Order)
 
filed September 7, 2010 and the "Order Granting Custody,
 
Visitation and Support" (Custody, Visitation, and Support Order)
 
filed July 8, 2010. Both orders were entered in the Family Court
 
1
of the First Circuit  (family court).  The Custody, Visitation,
 
and Support Order awarded sole legal and physical custody of four
 
children to the children's mother, Plaintiff-Appellee Jacqueline
 
Tamman (Jacqueline), and determined visitation, child support,
 
temporary alimony arrears, educational expenses, health and life
 
insurance, and the family court's continuing jurisdiction.

attending summer school because she is struggling in Iolani
contrary to the testimony of Deanna Kanekuni and the court’s
finding of fact #34 and the then impending start of summer

86, 87, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 107, 108, 110, 111, 112, 114 and 115
as well as Conclusions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 
Sami's opening brief does not comply with Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) because Sami's counsel 
failed to include (1) in the statement of the case, "record 
references supporting each statement of fact or mention of court 
or agency proceedings," in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(3) 
(emphasis added), (2) in the statement of points of error, where 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the record the alleged error occurred and where the error was
 
objected to, in violation of Rule 28(b)(4) and (3) included a
 
section on statement of questions presented contrary to the
 
directives of Rule 28(b).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Sami's
 
points of error are without merit.
 
Sami waived any challenge regarding service of the 
complaint, and therefore, the family court had personal 
jurisdiction over Sami. Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai' i 91, 135, 969 
P.2d 1209, 1253 (1998); Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai'i 159, 166, 45 P.3d 359, 366 (2002); Puckett v. Puckett, 94 
Hawai'i 471, 472, 16 P.3d 876, 877 (App. 2000) 
The family court had subject matter jurisdiction.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 580-47, 583A-201 and 584-15.
 
As to the decision of the family court:
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, [an
appellate court] will not disturb the family court's decisions on
appeal unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant
and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
As to the challenged findings of fact of the family
 
court:
 
In this jurisdiction, a trial
court's [FsOF] [sic] are subject to the
clearly erroneous standard of review. An
 FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence to support the finding, the
appellate court is left with the definite
and firm conviction in reviewing the
entire evidence that a mistake has been
 committed. 
Chun v. Bd. of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement Sys. of 
the State of Hawai' i, 106 Hawai' i 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 
(2005), reconsideration denied, 106 Hawai' i 477, 106 P.3d
1120 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and
ellipses omitted)[.] 
"An FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record
lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. We have defined substantial evidence as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Leslie v. 
Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai' i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225
(1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)[.] 
Inoue v. Inoue, 118 Hawai' i 86, 92-93, 185 P.3d 834, 840-41 (App. 
2008), cert. rejected, 118 Hawai' i 194, 186 P.3d 629 (2008). 
Nothing in the record indicates the family court abused
 
its discretion or issued clearly erroneous findings of fact
 
regarding custody of the children, visitation, contact, child
 
support, or alimony.
 
The family court did not abuse its discretion when it 
denied, in substantial part, Sami's Motion for Reconsideration. 
A motion for reconsideration gives a party the opportunity to 
present new evidence or make new arguments that could not have 
been made in the earlier proceeding. Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 
Hawai'i 459, 465, 121 P.3d 924, 930 (App. 2005). Reconsideration 
is not an opportunity to re-litigate what has already been 
decided or to bring up arguments that a party could have and 
should have made during the earlier proceeding. Id. Sami 
failed to present any new evidence or make new arguments to support his contention that the family court should grant his 
Motion for Reconsideration. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Regarding Motion
 
for Reconsideration of Order Entered on July 8, 2010 or in the
 Alternative Motion for New Trial and/or Reopening of the Hearing"
 
filed September 7, 2010 and the "Order Granting Custody,

Visitation and Support" filed on July 8, 2010 in the Family Court
 
of the First Circuit are affirmed.
