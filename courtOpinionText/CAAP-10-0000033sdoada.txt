On September 3, 2010, the Circuit Court dismissed
 
Burgo's Petition and he timely filed this appeal.
 
As best as can be discerned from Burgo's Opening Brief, 
on appeal, he asserts that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction 
to convict him in FC-CR No. 04-1-385K and CR No. 05-1-0043K because he is an American national citizen, he is a citizen of the nation of Hawai' i, and the State of Hawai' i is a corporation. 
However, Burgo also states that he is not a resident of the State of Hawai' i and not a citizen of the United States. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Burgo's points of error as follows:
 
Burgo failed to provide any support for the proposition 
that being an "American national citizen" deprived the Circuit Court of subject matter or personal jurisdiction in FC-CR No. 04­1-385K and CR No. 05-1-0043K. Persons claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai' i are subject to the laws of the State of 
Hawai'i, including the statutes providing for the jurisdiction of 
the circuit courts. See generally State v. Fergerstrom, 106 
Hawai'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004); State v. Lorenzo, 
77 Hawai' i 219, 220, 883 P.2d 641, 642, (App. 1994); State v.

Jim, 80 Hawai' i 168, 172, 907 P.2d 754, 758 (1995). The State of 
Hawai'i is not a corporation. Haw. Const. art. I, § 1. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Finding Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 
from Custody, Filed May 17, 2010, Patently Frivolous and
 Dismissing Petition, filed on September 3, 2010 in the Circuit
 Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
