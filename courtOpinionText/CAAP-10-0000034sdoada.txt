SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this mortgage foreclosure action, Defendant-
Appellant Charito Echalas Chichioco (Chichioco) appeals from the
 
"Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of
 Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed January 14,
 2009" (Judgment) that was entered in the Circuit Court of the
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1
Second Circuit (Circuit Court)  on September 22, 2010.  The
 
Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank
 
National Association, as Trustee for the Structured Asset
 Securities Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-BC2
 
(U.S.
 Bank). We affirm the Circuit Court's Judgment.
 
Chichioco's arguments on appeal are difficult to 
decipher. It appears that Chichioco contends that U.S. Bank was not a real party in interest, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 17 (2000), because U.S. Bank was not the original holder of the promissory note and mortgage. Based on this contention, Chichioco argues that the Circuit Court erred in granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure. We disagree. 
At the outset, we note that Chichioco did not provide a 
transcript of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure. It is well settled that the appellant has the duty to supply the appellate court with a sufficient record to demonstrate the alleged error, which includes relevant transcripts. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Haw. 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995); Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 10(b)(1)(A) and Rule 11(a) (2010). We would be justified in rejecting Chichioco's appeal based on her failure to provide the relevant transcript. 
In any event, we reject Chichioco's arguments. In
 
support of its motion for summary judgment, U.S. Bank presented
 evidence of a recorded assignment of mortgage dated September 29,
 2008, and that it was the current owner of the mortgage and
 promissory note. It also presented evidence that Chichioco had
 defaulted on her payment obligations under the promissory note
 and mortgage. Based on the record presented and the arguments on
 appeal, we conclude that U.S. Bank established that it was the
 real party in interest and that the Circuit Court did not err in
 granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment and decree of

We affirm the Judgment of the Circuit Court.
