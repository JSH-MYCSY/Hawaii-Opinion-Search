STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CARL EDWARD LEDUNE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KONA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-10-00859; REPORT NO. C10006564)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Carl Edward Ledune (Ledune) appeals
 
from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment (Judgment),
 
filed on August 31, 2010, in the District Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit (District Court).  Ledune was convicted of Operating a
 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2010) and
 
Driving without a License, in violation of HRS ยง 286-102(b)
 
(Supp. 2010). 
On appeal, Ledune contends there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict him of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Ledune's point of error as follows:
 
Contrary to Ledune's claim, there was substantial 
evidence to support Ledune's conviction for Operating a Vehicle 
under the Influence of an Intoxicant. Officer Andrade's 
testimony was found by the District Court to be credible. 
Officer Andrade testified, inter alia, that Ledune crossed the 
solid yellow centerline of the road three times and made a wide 
right turn so as to end up in an oncoming lane before he was 
stopped. Officer Andrade stated that Ledune's eyes were red, 
watery, and glassy, which he believed were signs that Ledune was 
under the influence of an intoxicant. Officer Andrade smelled a 
strong odor of alcohol emanating from Ledune. Officer Andrade 
observed that Ledune's conduct after the stop was uncooperative 
and somewhat aggressive. Ledune refused to perform field 
sobriety tests. There was also testimony presented that Ledune 
was earlier seen drinking four shots of Jagermeister. When the 
evidence adduced at trial is considered in the strongest light 
for the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence to support 
Ledune's conviction that he was under the influence of an 
intoxicant in an amount sufficient to impair Ledune's normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against 
casualty. See, e.g., State v. Gaston, 108 Hawai' i 308, 119 P.3d 
616 (App. 2005) (upholding sufficiency of evidence of driving under the influence); State v. Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i 388, 15 P.3d 
314 (2000) (same).
