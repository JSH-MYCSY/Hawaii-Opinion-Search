NICHOLAS D. ANDUHA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-1501)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nicholas Devin Anduha (Anduha)
 
appeals from the September 7, 2010 Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence entered against him by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit's (Circuit Court).1
 
Anduha was charged with: two counts of Kidnapping, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-720(1)(d) (Supp.
 
2010) and/or HRS § 707-720(1)(e) (Supp. 2010); two counts of
 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of HRS
 
§ 707-716(1)(e) (Supp. 2009); seven counts of Sexual Assault in
 
the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-731(1)(a) (Supp.
 
2010); and one count of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in
 
violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(f) (Supp. 2010). After pleading
 
guilty on all counts, Anduha filed a Motion To Withdraw Plea,

which was denied by the Circuit Court. This timely appeal
 
followed.
 
Anduha raises one point of error on appeal, contending
 
that the Circuit Court erred when it denied the motion to
 
withdraw his guilty plea.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Anduha's
 
contentions as follows:
 
Citing State v. Gomes, 79 Hawai' i 32, 37, 897 P.2d 959, 
964 (1995), Anduha submits that he "did not intelligently waive 
his rights where he was not informed of his right to maintain his 
plea of not guilty" and, after meeting with a probation officer 
and relating to her that the sex he had with the complainant was 
consensual, he "realize[d] that he did not make the correct 
decision in giving up his right to fight the above referenced 
charges because the accusation lodged against him is false[.]" 
Even in the instance of a pre-sentence motion to 
withdraw a plea, a defendant does not have an absolute right to 
withdraw his or her guilty plea. State v. Topasna, 94 Hawai' i 
444, 451, 16 P.3d 849, 856 (App. 2000). However, a court may grant a pre-sentence motion for the withdrawal of a guilty plea 
where "the defendant has presented a fair and just reason for his 
[or her] request and the state has not relied upon the plea to 
its substantial prejudice." Gomes, 79 Hawai' i at 36, 897 P.2d at 
963 (citation omitted). 
Although there is no assertion that the State has 
relied upon Anduha's plea to its substantial prejudice, Anduha has not established plausible and legitimate reasons for 
withdrawal of his plea. See also State v. Nicholson, 120 Hawai' i 
480, 484, 210 P.3d 3, 7 (App. 2009). It is clear from the record that the Circuit Court engaged in an extensive, detailed, and 
comprehensive colloquy to ensure that Anduha knowingly,

intelligently, and voluntarily made his decision to accept the
 
State's plea bargain and plead guilty. The Circuit Court's
 
colloquy included, inter alia, that: Anduha's mind was clear
 
before he decided to plead; he could read, write, and understand
 
English; he understood the proceeding; his decision to plead was
 
made by him alone; he was aware of the facts underlying the
 
charges, he affirmatively admitted that he committed knowingly
 
the illegal acts set forth in the charges; he was fully apprised
 
of the consequences of his plea; he would be foregoing his right
 
to plead not guilty; and he could not change his plea at a later
 
date. Anduha presented no evidence of a change of circumstances
 
or new information that would constitute a fair and just reason
 
for withdrawing his plea. Consequently, the Circuit Court did
 
not err when it found that Anduha knowingly, intelligently, and
 
voluntarily pleaded guilty to his charges and did not abuse its
 
discretion in denying his motion To withdraw plea.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's September 7,
 
2010 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence is affirmed.
