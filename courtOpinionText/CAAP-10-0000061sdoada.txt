IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CLIFFORD AKANA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 01-1-1738)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Clifford Akana (Akana) appeals from
 
the Judgment (Judgment) filed on September 23, 2010 in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
 
2
In 2002, Akana entered guilty pleas  to six counts of
Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(b) (1993); eighteen counts of 
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of HRS § 707­
732(1)(b) (1993); and one count of Terroristic Threatening in the 
First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-716(1)(d) (1993). 
Upon 
motion of the State of Hawai' i (State), the circuit court 
sentenced Akana on January 22, 2003 to extended terms of 
1
 Except where otherwise noted, the Honorable Michael A. Town presided.

 Akana also pled guilty to one count of Continuous Sexual Assault of a
Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years, in violation of HRS § 707-733.5 (Supp.
2000); however, the circuit court dismissed this charge on February 13, 2003.

imprisonment on all counts to which he pled and entered a
 
judgment.
 
Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 40, Akana filed a Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct 
Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody (Rule 40 Petition) 
on August 13, 2008. Akana's sole ground for relief was that 
pursuant to State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai' i 432, 168 P.3d 562 
(2007), the extended term sentencing was unconstitutional on its face. On December 12, 2008, the circuit court granted the Rule 
40 Petition, vacated Akana's sentence, and ordered a jury trial 
on the issue of the State's Motion for Extended Term of 
Imprisonment. 
On September 23, 2010, a jury found on all counts to
 
which Akana pled that he was a multiple offender and an extended
 
term of imprisonment was necessary for the protection of the
 
public. The circuit court entered the Judgment, imposing
 
concurrent extended term sentences.
 
On appeal,3
 Akana contends:
(1) He was precluded from presenting an adequate
 
defense when the circuit court denied his Ex-Parte Motion for
 Investigative Funds (Motion for Funds) to retain a forensic
 
psychologist.
 
(2) The circuit court erred when it denied his oral
 
motion to dismiss because there was insufficient evidence of
 
factors to support an extended term of imprisonment for
 
protection of the public.

 Akana's opening brief fails to cite to the electronic record as
required by Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 25 and 28.
Akana's counsel is warned that future briefs must cite to the electronic 
record, if available. 
The State's answering brief fails to comply with HRAP Rule 28(c) and
(b)(3) by failing to include in the "Statement of Facts" (which this court
interprets as "Statement of the Case"), "record references supporting each
statement of fact or mention of court . . . proceedings." The Deputy
Prosecuting Attorney is warned that future non-compliance with Rule 28(c) and
(b)(3) may result in sanctions against him.

(3) Jury Instructions 27 through 31 were erroneous or
 
irrelevant.
 
(4) The circuit court improperly admitted into
 
evidence his prior conviction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Akana's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion
 
when it denied Akana's Motion for Funds. "Under HRS § 802-7, the
 
court may provide a criminal defendant with funds for expert
 
assistance 'upon a finding that such funds are necessary for an
 
adequate defense.'" State v. Hoopii, 68 Haw. 246, 248, 710 P.2d
 
1193, 1195 (1985). Before an extended term sentence may be
 imposed on a defendant, the fact finder must determine the State
 
has proven that (1) the defendant is a multiple offender being
 
sentenced for two or more felonies, and (2) the extended sentence
 
is necessary for protection of the public. HRS § 706-662(4)
 
(Supp. 2000).
4
 
In Akana's Motion for Funds, he argued that to
 
determine whether an extended sentence was necessary to protect
 
the public, "the jury would need to examine [Akana's] past life,
 
4
 HRS § 706-662(4)(a) provides:
 
§706-662 Criteria for extended terms of imprisonment.  A
 
convicted defendant may be subject to an extended term of
imprisonment under section 706-661, if the convicted defendant
satisfies one or more of the following criteria:
 
. . . .
 
(4)	 The defendant is a multiple offender whose criminal
actions were so extensive that a sentence of
 imprisonment for an extended term is necessary for
protection of the public. The court shall not make
 this finding unless:
 
(a)	 The defendant is being sentenced for two or more
felonies or is already under sentence of
imprisonment for felony[.]

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
not only his prior convictions, but other life experiences, and
 
his present life and stressors, in other words, his psychological
 
state, in order to make a sound judgment on his future
 
dangerousness to the community." 
Akana cites to no authority to support his contention 
that the jury must examine his past life experiences and 
psychological state in order to determine the need for an 
extended sentence to protect the public. Pursuant to HRS § 706­
662(4), a jury need only determine that the "defendant is a 
multiple offender whose criminal actions were so extensive that a 
sentence of imprisonment for an extended term is necessary for 
protection of the public." Pursuant to HRS § 706-606 (1993),5 
the court must consider a defendant's history and characteristics in determining the sentence to impose, but even then "[t]he fact 
that a court does not orally address every factor stated in HRS 
§ 706-606 at the time of sentencing does not mean the court 
failed to consider those factors." State v. Sinagoga, 81 Hawai' i 
421, 427-28, 918 P.2d 228, 234-35 (App. 1996), overruled on other 
5
 HRS § 706-606 provides:
 
§706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,
shall consider:
 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the
 history and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2)	 The need for the sentence imposed:
 
(a)	 To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for law, and to provide just
punishment for the offense;
 
(b)	 To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct;
 
(c)	 To protect the public from further crimes of the
defendant; and
 
(d)	 To provide the defendant with needed educational
or vocational training, medical care, or other
correctional treatment in the most effective
 manner; and
 
(3)	 The kinds of sentences available[.]

grounds by State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai' i 219, 227 n.8, 74 P.3d 
575, 583 n.8 (2003). 
Furthermore, Akana did not need expert testimony to
 
rebut the State's expert testimony because the State had made it
 
clear that it did not intend to offer expert testimony unless
 
Akana offered expert testimony.
 Because Akana failed to establish that the services of
 
a forensic psychologist were necessary for an adequate defense,
 
the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied
 
Akana's Motion for Funds.
 
(2) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion
 
when it denied Akana's motion to dismiss. Under HRS § 706­
662(4)(a), Akana was subject to an extended term of imprisonment
 
because he was a multiple offender whose criminal actions were so
 
extensive that a sentence of imprisonment for an extended term
 
was necessary for protection of the public and he was being
 
sentenced for two or more felonies. 
The jury heard evidence regarding a prior sexual 
assault conviction, where Akana approached a girl on the beach, 
knelt near her with his penis exposed, showed her a rock in his 
hand, and commanded her to "suck my dick or I'll hit you with a 
rock." She threw sand in his eyes, and he responded by hitting 
her on the head five times with the rock. There was substantial 
evidence to support the findings of the jury that Akana qualified 
for an extended term sentence. State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 
33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998). The evidence was sufficient for the circuit court to deny Akana's motion to dismiss. 
(3) The circuit court did not err in giving its jury
 
instructions. Akana contends that Jury Instructions 27 through
 
31 were erroneous or irrelevant.
 
On appeal, Akana makes an argument regarding Jury
 
Instruction 27, which he failed to object to below. Where jury
 
instructions were not objected to, the burden is on the appellant
 
to rebut the "presumption that unobjected-to jury instructions
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are correct." State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 337 n.6, 141 
P.3d 974, 984 n.6 (2006). 
Akana contends the circuit court stated an incorrect
 
burden of proof in Jury Instruction 27 when it advised the jury
 
members that "you may consider" the HRS § 706-606 factors. He
 
argues that the HRS § 706-606 factors "must be proved beyond a
 
reasonable doubt." We disagree.
 
The jury's duty under HRS § 706-662(4) was to determine 
whether Akana was subject to an extended term sentence of 
imprisonment. See Supplemental Commentary on §§ 706-661 and 662 
(Supp. 2010) (Act 1 of the 2007 Haw. Sess Laws, 2d Spec. Sess., amended HRS §§ 706-661, 706-662, and 706-664 to require "that a 
jury determine the facts necessary to impose an extended term of 
imprisonment . . . and that facts necessary to impose an extended 
term of imprisonment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt."). 
Once the jury determined Akana was eligible for an extended term 
sentence, it was then the duty of the circuit court to consider 
the HRS § 707-606 factors in imposing the extended sentence. 
State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai' i 181, 195-96, 981 P.2d 1127, 1141-42 
(1999). In making its findings, the jury certainly could have considered the sentencing factors listed in HRS § 706-606, but 
they were under no duty to do so. HRS § 706-606 does not provide 
elements to be proved; rather, the statute provides factors the 
court must consider when it imposes a sentence. Akana did not 
meet his burden to rebut the presumption that Jury Instruction 27 
was correct. 
At his sentencing hearing, Akana objected to Jury
 
Instructions 28 and 29. On appeal, Akana contends the
 
instructions "were not relevant," but provides no argument as to
 
why they were not relevant. Where a point is not argued, it may
 
be deemed waived. HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
 
Akana failed to object to Jury Instructions 30 and 31
 
at the hearing. Again, on appeal, he contends the instructions
 
"were not relevant," but fails to provide an argument. Where a
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
point is not argued, it may be deemed waived. HRAP Rule
 
28(b)(7).
 
(4) The circuit court did not err when it admitted 
Akana's prior conviction into evidence. Evidence of a prior 
conviction is admissible when it is relevant and its probative 
value outweighs its prejudicial value. State v. Behrendt, 124 
Hawai'i 90, 102, 237 P.3d 1156, 1168 (2010); see Hawaii Rules of 
Evidence Rules 401 through 404. Akana argues that his prior 
conviction was old and irrelevant, its probative value was 
outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and it was inadmissible 
"propensity evidence" of his character. Akana had already been 
convicted of the felonies that were the subject of the instant 
case. The evidence of the prior conviction was admitted to 
establish that he presented a danger to the public; the very 
evidence required by HRS § 706-662(4)(a). The circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of Akana's 
prior conviction to assist the jury in determining whether or not 
he presented a danger to the public. Behrendt, 124 Hawai' i at 
102-03, 237 P.3d at 1168-69. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
September 23, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
