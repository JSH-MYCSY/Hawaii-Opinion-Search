K.C. LOESCH, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-10-000141)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard and Reifurth, JJ., and
Foley, Presiding Judge, dissenting)
 
On August 30, 2010, the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit ("District Court")  filed a Notice of Entry of Judgment
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, in which it convicted Defendant-
Appellant K.C. Loesch ("Loesch") of one count of Accidents
 Involving Damage to Vehicle or Property, in violation of Hawai' i 
Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 291C-13 (Supp. 2011).

 The Honorable Leslie A. Hayashi presided.

 The statute provides in relevant part:
 
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting
only in damage to a vehicle or other property that is driven
or attended by any person shall immediately stop such
vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as
 possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in every event
shall remain at, the scene of the accident until the driver
has fulfilled the requirements of section 291C-14. Every
such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more
than is necessary. . . .

AW. REV. STAT. § 291C-13.
 
HRS § 291C-14(a) (2007) provides:
 
Duty to give information and render aid. (a) The
driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in
injury to or death of any person or damage to any vehicle or
other property which is driven or attended by any person
shall give the driver's name, address, and the registration
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentenced to pay a $100 fine and two fees.
 
On appeal, Loesch argues that the District Court erred
 
by (1) denying his motion to dismiss the charge on the basis that
 
it failed to set forth the requisite state of mind and (2)
 convicting him based on findings that were "not only against the
 weight of the evidence, but unsupported by substantial evidence." 
Loesch also maintains that (3) his trial counsel was ineffective
 for failing to refresh the memory of the complaining witness
 with, or to otherwise introduce, a letter that allegedly
 documented prior inconsistent statements that she made to an
 insurance representative after the incident. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Loesch's points of error as follows:
 
On May 13, 2010, prior to his trial before the District
 
Court, Loesch was orally charged:
 
[O]n or about January 4th, 2010, you, as the driver of a
vehicle involved in an accident resulting only in damage to
a vehicle or other property that is driven or attended by
any other person, did fail to immediately stop the vehicle
at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as possible
and did fail to forthwith return to and in every even remain
at the scene of the accident and fulfill the requirements of
Section 291C-14 HRS, thereby committing the offense of
Accidents Involving Damage to Vehicle Or Property, in
violation of 291C-13 HRS.
 
Loesch's attorney moved to dismiss, arguing that the charge
 
number of the vehicle the driver is driving, and shall upon
request and if available exhibit the driver's license or
permit to drive to any person injured in the accident or to
the driver or occupant of or person attending any vehicle or
other property damaged in the accident and shall give such
information and upon request exhibit such license or permit
to any police officer at the scene of the accident or who is
investigating the accident and shall render to any person
injured in the accident reasonable assistance, including the
carrying, or the making of arrangements for the carrying, of
the person to a physician, surgeon, or hospital for medical
or surgical treatment if it is apparent that such treatment
is necessary, or if such carrying is requested by the
injured person; provided that if the vehicle involved in the
accident is a bicycle, the driver of the bicycle need not
exhibit a license or permit to drive.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
failed to state the requisite mens rea.3 The District Court
 
denied the motion. We hold that the District Court erred, and
 
the motion should have been granted.
 
In support of our conclusion, we first must determine
 
what HRS § 291C-13 requires the State to prove. Pursuant to HRS
 § 291C-13,
 
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting
only in damage to a vehicle or other property that is driven
or attended by any person shall immediately stop such
vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as
 possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in every event
shall remain at, the scene of the accident until the driver
has fulfilled the requirements of section 291C-14. Every
such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more
than is necessary. . . .
 
HAW.  REV.  STAT. § 291C-13. HRS § 291C-13 does not, in itself, set
 
forth the requisite mens rea. However, pursuant to HRS § 702­
204,
 
Except as provided in section 702-212, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless the person acted intentionally,
knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies,
with respect to each element of the offense. When the state
 
of mind required to establish an element of an offense is
 
not specified by the law, that element is established if,
 with respect thereto, a person acts intentionally,
 knowingly, or recklessly.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 702-204 (1993) (emphasis added). Pursuant to HRS
 
§ 702-212, criminal statutes are excepted from the provisions of
 
§ 702-204, generally, when (1) the offense is a violation or (2)
 if the offense is defined by a statute outside of the Hawaii
 Penal Code (that is, outside of Title 37 of the HRS) and "a
 legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for such offense
 or with respect to any element thereof plainly appears." H
AW. REV.
 
STAT. § 702-212 (1993).
 
A violation of HRS § 291C-13 is a petty misdemeanor 
crime. State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 440, 127 P.3d 95, 100 
(App. 2005); H AW. REV. STAT. § 291C-161(d) (2007). Furthermore, 
while HRS § 291C-13 is not found in the Hawaii Penal Code, 
3
 After the charge was read, Loesch's attorney stated: "Your Honor,
before he responds, Defense would just move to dismiss. Lack of jurisdiction.
It fails to state an essential element, (indiscernible) intent." Although a
portion of the objection is indiscernible, we interpret Loesch's objection to
be that the charge was insufficient because it failed to allege some criminal
intent — that is, the requisite mens rea.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
legislative intent to impose absolute liability for violating the 
statute does not plainly appear. See State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 
131, 140, 913 P.2d 57, 66 (1996) ("Absent statutory language expressly imposing absolute liability, the states of mind denominated in HRS § 702-204 will generally apply, because we will not lightly discern a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability."). Thus, for a defendant to be found guilty of violating HRS § 291C-13, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she violated § 291C-13 with an intentional, knowing, or reckless state of mind. Cf. State v. Nesmith, 127 
Hawai'i 48, 54, 276 P.3d 617, 623 (2012) (referring to HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1)). 
We next determine whether, upon a timely objection, the 
failure to identify the requisite mens rea in a charge under HRS § 291C-13 requires dismissal of the case. In State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), the defendant Wheeler was 
orally charged with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant ("OVUII") in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), which states: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]
 
121 Hawai' i at 385–386, 386 n.1, 219 P.3d at 1172–73, 1173 n.1. 
While the statute did not define the term "operate," the term was 
defined in HRS § 291E-1 (2007) to mean "to drive or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway . . . ." Id. at 391, 219 P.3d at 1179 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Although the oral charge tracked the language of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), it did not allege that Wheeler had operated a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway, and Wheeler's attorney moved to dismiss the charge on the basis that the charge was insufficient. See id. at 386–87, 219 P.3d at 
1173–74. The district court denied the motion, and Wheeler was ultimately convicted of OVUII. Id. at 387, 389, 219 P.3d at 
1174, 1176. 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wheeler appealed, arguing that the district court erred
 
in denying his motion to dismiss "because the oral charge failed
 
to allege an 'essential fact' — that Wheeler operated a vehicle
 on a public road, street or highway[.]" Id. at 389, 219 P.3d at
 
1176. In a summary disposition order, this court vacated the
 judgment and remanded to the district court with instructions to
 dismiss the charge without prejudice, holding that the oral
 charge was insufficient because it "failed to include a plain,
 concise and definite statement of each of the essential facts
 constituting the offense of OVUII because it failed to allege
 that Wheeler operated a vehicle on a public road, street or
 highway, an attendant circumstance of the offense." Id. at
 
389–90, 219 P.3d at 1176–77.
 
The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that "[a]lthough 
the oral charge here tracked the language of HRS § 291E-61, the failure of the charge to allege that Wheeler was driving his vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense rendered the charge deficient." Id. at 393, 400, 
219 P.3d at 1180, 1187. The Court noted that the word "operate" had been given a statutory meaning that "does not comport with its commonly understood definition," as the common definition "does not geographically limit where the conduct must take place." Id. at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181. Thus, the term "operate" 
as used in HRS § 291E-61 "is neither 'unmistakable' nor 'readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding.'" Id. 
(quoting State v. Merino, 81 Hawai' i 198, 214, 915 P.2d 672, 688 
(1996)). And therefore, "[t]he use of the phrase 'operate' did not provide adequate notice to Wheeler that the State was required to prove that his operation of the vehicle occurred on a public way, street, road, or highway." Id. at 395, 219 P.3d at 
1182. 
The Supreme Court expanded on Wheeler in State v. 
Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617, holding, among other 
things, that a charge of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) "must allege the requisite mens rea in order to fully define the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding[.]" 127 Hawai' i at 50, 276 P.3d at 619.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) does not in itself define the
 
requisite mens rea, the Court held that, pursuant to HRS § 702­204, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
 defendant violated HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) with an intentional,
 knowing, or reckless state of mind as to all elements of the
 offense. Id. at 53–54, 276 P.3d at 622–23. After identifying
 
the problem with the charge in Wheeler — that the statutory
 definition of "operate" contained a geographical limit that was
 "neither 'unmistakable' nor 'readily comprehensible to persons of
 common understanding'" — the Court stated:
 
Similarly, in this case, at oral argument, the State
argued that any person on the street would know a charge of
"operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant"
to mean drunk driving. However, that common understanding
is not reflected in the statutory framework creating the
offense of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), under which it
is a crime only if one intentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly (not negligently) "operates or assumes actual
physical control of a vehicle ... [w]hile under the
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the
person's normal mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty." As in Wheeler, the
OVUII offense in this case is statutorily defined as
narrower than what is commonly understood to constitute
"drunk driving." In that sense, a charge alleging a
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) that omits the statutorily
incorporated culpable states of mind from HRS § 702-204 is
not readily comprehensible to persons of common
understanding. As such, a charge omitting the allegation of
mens rea is deficient for failing to provide fair notice to
the accused.
 
Id. at 54–55, 276 P.3d at 623–24. With regard to the issue
 
raised by this case as to whether the charge provides sufficient
notice of the mens rea necessary for conviction, the Court
 further stated:
  
[I]n this case, the "intentional, knowing, or reckless"
state of mind requirements, though not an "element of an
offense" under HRS § 702-205, needed to be charged in an HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(1) Complaint to alert the defendants of
precisely what they needed to defend against to avoid a
conviction. A charge omitting the mens rea requirements
would not alert the Petitioners that negligently operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental faculties or
ability to care for the person and guard against casualty,
for instance, is not an offense recognized under HRS § 291E­61(a)(1). In short, mens rea must be alleged in an HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(1) charge.
 
Id. at 56, 276 P.3d at 625.
 
The logic of this holding in Nesmith applies to charges
 
for violating HRS § 291C-13. The charge read to Loesch tracked
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the language of HRS § 291C-13, but failed to inform Loesch that
 
the State was required to prove that Loesch violated the statute
 intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. Nothing in the charge
 informs Loesch that a negligent or unknowing violation of HRS
 § 291C-13 is not a criminal offense. Thus, a charge under HRS
 § 291C-13 must allege the requisite mens rea in order to fully
 define the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible
 to persons of common understanding. Therefore, the charge in
 this case was insufficient, and the District Court erred in
 denying Loesch's motion to dismiss.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on August 30, 2010
 in the District Court of the First Circuit is vacated, and the
 case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to
 dismiss the case without prejudice. In light of our disposition
 on Loesch's first point of error, we need not address the other
 points of error he raises on appeal.
