from the (1) September 20, 2010 "Order Granting in Part and
 
Denying in Part Grievant SHOPO's Motion to Confirm Arbitrator's
 Award [Filed 7/20/10]" (Order re Motion to Confirm); (2)

Counter-Motion to Vacate [Filed 7/2/09]," (Order re Counter-

1
Circuit  (circuit court).
On appeal, SHOPO contends the circuit court erred by: 
(1) vacating the arbitrator's remedial promotion of
 
Grievants by ruling that:
 
(a) the arbitrator's remedy was in excess of his
 
authority under the collective bargaining agreement, effective
 from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2011 (CBA), and in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-23(a)(4) (Supp. 2001); 
(b) CBA provisions allowing the arbitrator to 
"otherwise change[]" any action by Employer-Appellees County of 
Kaua
'i (County) and Kaua 'i Police Department (KPD) (collectively,
Employer) that the arbitrator found to be unfair, unjust, or 
improper were unclear, vague and ambiguous, and "potentially" 
conflicted with Article 11 of the CBA and HRS § 89-9(d) (Supp. 2007); 
(c) the arbitrator's remedy violated public policy;
 
and,
 
(2) substituting its own interpretation of the CBA for
 
that of the arbitrator in violation of CBA provisions that the
 arbitrator's decision be "final and binding."
I. BACKGROUND
 
Around May 22, 2007, Employer notified SHOPO that they
 
would promote five (5) officers from an existing eligible list,
 
1
 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
compiled as the result of a written exam, consisting of ten (10)
 
officers, including Rodrigues, Rodriguez, and Sokei
 (collectively, Grievants). The acting chief of police utilized
 
an oral interview process to pick the officers for promotion.
 
On July 1, 2007, the new CBA under which SHOPO raises
its points on appeal became effective.
 

 
On or about August 29, 2007, grievants received letters
 
from KPD notifying them of their non-selection to the position of
 
police sergeant.
 
On or around September 12, 2007, SHOPO filed grievances
 
on behalf of Grievants, police officers with Employer. Grievants
 contested Employer's promotional process after they were not
 selected for promotion to the rank of police sergeant. SHOPO's
 grievances asserted inter alia that the promotion process was
 "subjective, arbitrary and capricious," heavily dependent on an
 inconsistent oral interview exam
2
 and not based on merit,
ability, or fair standards as required by Article 47 of the CBA3
 
and various statutory and regulatory requirements for promotions
 within the civil service system. SHOPO requested promotion to
 sergeant for Grievants and retroactive payment of all salary and
 other benefits, rights, and privileges resulting from the
 
2 The 10 questions used in the oral exam fell under five general
categories: Trustworthiness, Cooperative & Collaborative Work Tendency,
Adherence to a Work Ethic, Friendly Disposition, and Sensitive to the Interest
of Others. The arbitrator concluded the questions "were very broad and could
be interpreted and answered in a number of subjective ways" and lacked model
answers against which the candidates answers could be judged. 
3 Parties disagree as to which version of the CBA should apply to
the grievances. SHOPO contends this matter was grieved under the CBAeffective from July 7, 2007 to June 30, 2011. In its answer, Employer assertsthat the applicable CBA was effective from July 1, 2003-June 30, 2007. In his decision and award, the arbitrator cited to both the 2003-2007 and 2007-2011CBAs. Both the 2003-2007 and 2007-2011 CBAs at issue were between SHOPO and the following entities: State of Hawai' i, City and County of Honolulu, County
of Hawai' i, County of Maui, and County of Kaua' i. 
Differences between the text of the two CBA versions are
 
unimportant because: the arbitrator found that the parties agreed the
pertinent portions of both CBAs were substantially similar; the circuit court
confirmed the arbitrator's findings; and neither party challenges this issue
on appeal. Further, as discussed infra, legislative amendments to HRS § 89­9(d) (Supp. 2007) in 2007 apply to both CBAs because they were both in effect
"on and after June 30, 2007." The July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2007 CBA was in
effect on June 30, 2007 and the July 1, 2007 - June 30, 2011 CBA was in effect
"after" June 30, 2007.

improper non-promotion.
 
In the "Arbitration Decision and Award" (Award) dated
 
4
June 2, 2009, the arbitrator  found the oral interview portion of
the promotional process did not address the requirements of the
 position and was subjective, arbitrary and capricious. The
 arbitrator found that the promotion process did not take into
 account the applicant's entire history, knowledge and abilities,
 and was not based on fair standards of merit and ability as
 required by the CBA.
5 He wrote, "[t]he varied instructions on
 
what experience could be used in answering the oral questions by
 each candidate and the inconsistent treatment of the candidates
 renders the oral examination unfair, inconsistent, and
 arbitrary." The arbitrator further noted that Employer failed to
 meet with each grievant and provide the reasons for the
 employee's non-selection for promotion, in violation of the CBA.
 
The arbitrator ordered that Grievants be promoted to

 
the position of sergeant with a retroactive effective date of
 September 23, 2007, and also mandated back pay and entitlement to
 any additional rights, benefits and privileges that would have
 resulted from promotion. The arbitrator also recommended that
 KPD and SHOPO meet to review, discuss and implement measures to
 improve the promotion process.
 
4 Larry L. Cundiff, Sr. served as arbitrator. 
5
 The Arbitrator concluded:
 
The Employer's promotional oral interview
procedure as administered by the [KPD] on
August 20, 21, 2007, led to subjective,
arbitrary and capricious promotional
practice. The oral interview, as designed
for these promotions, contains
unacceptable and ambiguous standards, and
if not rectified, could lead to future
grievances filed on the part of
unsuccessful candidates. The panel which
administered the oral interviews, were not
given a tool for the oral interviews that
would allow for objective and fair scores.
The evidence to support the final scores
applied in these particular grievances,
led this Arbitrator to the conclusion that
 the weight of the evidence supports a
finding that the grievances of [Rodrigues,
Rodriguez, and Sokei] are sustained.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 23, 2009, SHOPO filed a motion to confirm the
 
arbitrator's Award in the circuit court. SHOPO argued that the
 
Award was a proper exercise of the arbitrator's authority under
 Article 32(L)(9)(b)(2) of the CBA, which authorized him to set
 aside, reduce or otherwise change any action which the arbitrator
 finds "unfair, unjust, [or] improper." Employer opposed the
 motion to confirm and filed a counter-motion to vacate the
 arbitrator's award on July 2, 2009. Employer argued the
 arbitrator promoted the three officers based on his own criteria,
 exceeded his authority as arbitrator, and the remedial promotion
 violated public policy by encroaching on management's right to
 promote.
 
On August 6, 2009, the circuit court issued the Order 
re Motion to Confirm and Order re Motion to Vacate. The circuit court denied SHOPO's motion to confirm because "the Arbitrator's remedy exceeded the arbitrator's authority and powers granted under Article 32 of the [CBA] in violation of HRS § 658A­23(a)(4)."
6 The court granted in part and denied in part 
Employer's motion to vacate, confirmed that the grievances were properly before the arbitrator and within his jurisdiction and authority, and remanded for rehearing on the issue of remedy. On September 1, 2009, SHOPO filed a Notice of Appeal. In State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers (SHOPO) v. County of Kauai, 123 Hawai
'i 128, 230 P.3d 428 (App. 2010), this court 
dismissed the case for lack of appellate jurisdiction and held that the circuit court order denying a motion to confirm an award, vacating the award, and directing rehearing was not appealable pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a)(3) (Supp. 2008). Id. at 
132, 230 P.3d at 432.

 HRS § 658A-23 (Supp. 2002) provides
 
[§658A-23] Vacating award. (a) Upon motion to the
court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court
shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:
 
. . . .
 
(4) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers[.]
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to the circuit court's August 6, 2009 orders,
 
the parties met with the arbitrator and agreed to a rehearing
 
through memoranda. On July 8, 2010, the arbitrator issued his
 ruling that the "Arbitrator's original remedy will remain
 unchanged based on the Arbitrator's reading and interpretation of
 the plain language and meaning of the 'Arbitrator's Authority,'
 as set forth in Article 32 of the applicable collective
 bargaining agreement." The arbitrator ruled that the CBA vested
 him with authority to resolve the grievances, the phrase
 "otherwise change[]" was clear and unambiguous, and the CBA
 placed no restrictions on his authority grant remedial
 promotions. He further found the remedy was consistent with past
 practices of the parties to the CBA and Employer had not
 contended during arbitration that Article 32 precluded remedial
 promotions.
 
On July 20, 2010, SHOPO filed a motion in the circuit
 
court to confirm the arbitrator's award. On August 5, 2010,
 Employer filed a memorandum in opposition and a counter-motion to
 vacate. Employer argued that the arbitrator exceeded his
 authority because Article 11 of the CBA retained Employer's
 management rights over promotional procedures and that the
 arbitrator could not mandate promotion as a remedy.
 
On September 20, 2010, the circuit court filed its
 
Order re Motion to Confirm, which confirmed the arbitrator's
 findings and decision in all respects except for the remedy. The
 circuit court found the remedial promotions were in excess of the
 arbitrator's authority under the CBA because the words "otherwise
 changed" in Article 32 of the CBA were "unclear, vague and
 ambiguous, [and] potentially conflict[ed] with Article 11 of the
 CBA and HRS § 89-9(d) [(Supp. 2012)]," and the remedy violates
 public policy.

 The circuit court ruled on SHOPO's motion to confirm as follows:
 
The [circuit court] grants the motion and
confirms the Arbitrator's findings and
decision in all respects, except for the
Arbitrator's remedy. The [circuit court]
denies the motion as it relates to the

Counter-Motion to Vacate which contained a substantially
 
identical ruling.
 
On October 15, 2010, SHOPO filed a notice of appeal.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
An appellate court reviews "the circuit court's ruling
 
on an arbitration award de novo," but is "mindful that the
 circuit court's review of arbitral awards must be extremely
 narrow and exceedingly deferential." 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth , 99
 
Hawai'i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) (citations, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
"The scope of an arbitrator's authority is determined
 
by agreement of the parties. An arbitrator must act within the
 scope of the authority conferred upon him by the parties and
 cannot exceed his power by deciding matters not submitted." 
Clawson v. Habilitat, Inc.,  71 Haw. 76, 78, 783 P.2d 1230, 1231
 
(1989). "[W]here an arbitrator has exceeded his or her
 powers . . . pursuant to HRS § 658-9(4), [] the resulting
 arbitration award must be vacated." Tatibouet, 99 Hawai
'i at 
235, 54 P.3d at 406.
 
When the parties include an arbitration clause in their
collective bargaining agreement, they choose to have
disputes concerning constructions of the contract resolved
by an arbitrator. Unless the arbitral decision does not
 draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, a
court is bound to enforce the award and is not entitled to
 review the merits of the contract dispute. This remains so
 even when the basis for the arbitrator's decision may be
ambiguous.

Rubber, Cork, Linoleum & Plastic Workers of Am., 461 U.S. 757,

Arbitrator's remedy which the [circuit
court] finds exceeded the arbitrator's
authority and powers granted under Article
32 of the [CBA] in violation of HRS
§ 658A-23(a)(4). The [circuit court]
finds that the words "otherwise changed"
as it relates to the Arbitrator'[s]
authority granted under Article
32.L.9.b.(2) of the CBA is unclear, vague
and ambiguous, potentially
conflicts with Article 11 of the CBA and
 HRS § 89-9(d) and that the Arbitrator's remedy
violates public policy.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 Employer was not estopped from challenging the award as
exceeding the arbitrator's authority
 
SHOPO contends that Employer was estopped from
 
contesting the arbitrator's authority to grant remedial

 
8
promotions pursuant to Article 11 or 32  of the CBA because it
failed to raise this argument during the arbitration process. 
The doctrine of quasi-estoppel provides "that one should not be
 permitted to take a position inconsistent with a previous
 position if the result is to harm another." Univ. of Hawaii
 
Prof'l Assembly on Behalf of Daeufer v. Univ. of Hawaii, 66 Haw.
 214, 221 659 P.2d 720, 726 (1983) (hereafter UHPA).
 
In UHPA, an employer agreed to submit tenure and
 
promotion grievances to final and binding arbitration, but argued
 to the circuit court that the arbitrator was powerless to grant

between SHOPO and Employer, provided 
9. Arbitration Award
 
b. Final and Binding - The award of the Arbitrator
 
shall be accepted as final and binding. There shall be no
 
appeal from the Arbitrator's decision by either party, if
such decision is within the scope of the Arbitrator's
authority as described below:
 
(1) Limitations on Arbitrator's Powers - The
 
Arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract
from, disregard, alter, or modify any of the terms of this
Agreement.
 
(2) Arbitrator's Authority - The Arbitrator's
 
authority shall be to decide whether Employer has violated,
misinterpreted or misapplied any of the terms of this
Agreement and in the case of any action which the Arbitrator
finds unfair, unjust, improper or excessive on the part of
Employer, such action may be set aside, reduced or otherwise
changed by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator may, in the
Arbitrator's discretion, award back pay to recompense in
whole or in part, the employee for any salary of financial
benefits lost, and return to the employee such other rights,
benefits, and privileges or portions thereof as may have
been lost or suffered. 
The arbitrator cites to this 2007-2011 version of the arbitration
 
clause in his decision. Pertinent language cited is identical to Article
32(L)(8) of the 2003-2007 CBA.

tenure or promotion upon a finding of arbitrary or capricious
 
conduct. Id., 66 Haw. at 221-22; 659 P.2d at 725-26. The court
 
held the employer was estopped from challenging the scope of the
 arbitrator's remedial authority. Id. The court reasoned that
 
failure to raise this issue during arbitration proceedings, and
 then pursuing it in judicial proceedings, would make the UHPA
 grievants "substantially disadvantaged in terms of time and money
 spent in the arbitration process and in litigation." Id., 66
 
Haw. at 222, 659 P.2d at 726.
 
UHPA is distinguishable from the instant case. While
 
both CBAs provided that an arbitrator's decision would be "final
 and binding[,]" the UHPA collective bargaining agreement
 expressly gave the arbitrator the right and power to "substitute
 his judgment for that of the official" if the arbitrator found
 the official's decision to be arbitrary or capricious, UHPA, 66
 Haw. at 223, 659 P.2d at 727. By contrast, Article 11 of the
 2003-2007 CBA, in this case expressly provides that Employer
 "reserves and retains, solely and exclusively, all management
 rights and authority, including the rights set forth in [HRS
 § 89-9(d)(1)-(8)], except as specifically abridged or modified by
 this Agreement."
 
SHOPO's other grounds for estoppel are unavailing. The
 
arbitrator found: "Employer never contended during the
 arbitration hearings that the language in Article 32 was not
 sufficiently worded to permit the Arbitrator to grant a promotion
 to remedy the grievances[.]" Although Employer did not
 specifically appeal the arbitrator's finding and rather sought
 vacatur of the remedy, review of the arbitration award is
 properly before this court pursuant to HRS Chapter 658A and the
 County properly filed a motion to vacate. Furthermore, Employer
 did contest the arbitrator's authority to actually promote the
 grievants. The Arbitration Decision and Award summarized
 Employer's arguments to include:
 
7. 	The Arbitrator has no jurisdiction over the subjects
raised by the Grievants.
 
8. 	The Grievants are not entitled to automatic promotions,
or back-pay at the Sergeant's level.
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We conclude that Employer is not estopped from asserting that the
 
Arbitrator exceeded his authority in granting promotions to the
 three grievants.
B. The arbitration award did not violate public policy
 
On appeal, SHOPO argues the circuit court erred because 
HRS § 89-9(d) allowed negotiated "promotional criteria embodied 
in Article 47 and to have violations of that article resolved through the grievance procedure in Article 32" and that the remedy ordered by the Arbitrator was consistent with the public policy articulated by the Legislature to encourage arbitration by making the process more meaningful. This court reviews whether "the contract as interpreted [by] an arbitrator violates some explicit public policy[.]" Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pac., 
Hawai
'i Region, Marine Div. of Int'l Longshoremen's & 
Warehousemen's Union v. Sause Bros., Inc., 77 Hawai 'i 187, 193, 
881 P.2d 1255, 1261 (App. 1994) (hereafter Inlandboatmen) (citation and original brackets omitted) (review is justified because public interests will go unrepresented unless the judiciary takes account of those interests when it considers whether to enforce such agreements). "[I]f the contract as interpreted by an arbitrator violates some explicit public policy, the courts are obliged to refrain from enforcing it." Id. at 193, 881 P.2d at 1261 (citation and original brackets omitted). This public policy consideration is an exception to the general deference given arbitration awards. 
[T]he public policy exception requires a court to determine
that (1) the award would violate some explicit public policy
that is well defined and dominant, and that is ascertained
by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from
general considerations of supposed public interests, and (2)
the violation of the public policy is clearly shown. Hence,
a refusal to enforce an arbitration award must rest on more
 than speculation or assumption.
 
Inlandboatmen, 77 Hawai 'i at 193-94, 881 P.2d at 1261-62 
(citations, internal quotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis 
omitted). 
At the August 17, 2010 hearing, Employer's counsel
 
argued that the arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA "was in
 violation of [HRS] Chapter 76, [and] in violation of the merit
 
10
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
principles[.]" The circuit court found the arbitrator's remedial
 
promotions remedy violated public policy: "[i]n particular it
 violates the employer's arena to develop . . . promotional
 criteria in concert with consultation with the union."
 
HRS § 76-1 (2012), entitled "Purposes; merit
 
principle," provides:
 
It is the purpose of this chapter to require each
jurisdiction to establish and maintain a separately
administered civil service system based on the merit
principle. The merit principle is the selection of persons
based on their fitness and ability for public employment and
the retention of employees based on their demonstrated
appropriate conduct and productive performance.
 
Id. (emphasis added).
 
HRS § 76-1(2) requires "[i]mpartial selection of
 
individuals for public service by means of competitive tests
 
which are fair, objective, and practical[.]" Article 47(B) of
 the CBA, entitled, "Promotions," preserves the merit principle:
 
B. Fair Standards of Merit and Ability "Promotions shall be
 
based upon fair standards of merit and ability, consistent
with applicable civil service statutes, rules and
regulations and procedures."
 
Employers and employees are generally not permitted to
 
negotiate an agreement that is inconsistent with the merit
 
principle. See HRS § 89-9(d). HRS § 89-9(d), which codifies an
 
employer's management rights in the context of a collectively
 bargained agreement, currently provides: 
(d) Excluded from the subjects of negotiations are
matters of classification, reclassification, benefits of but
not contributions to the Hawaii [Hawai' i] employer-union
health benefits trust fund, or a voluntary employees'beneficiary association trust; recruitment; examination;initial pricing; and retirement benefits except as providedin section 88-8(h). The employer and the exclusive
representative shall not agree to any proposal that would beinconsistent with the merit principle or the principle ofequal pay for equal work pursuant to section 76-1 or thatwould interfere with the rights and obligations of a publicemployer to: 
(1) Direct employees;
 
(2)	 Determine qualifications, standards for work,
and the nature and contents of examinations;
 
(3)	 Hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain
employees in positions;
 
(4)	 Suspend, demote, discharge, or take other
disciplinary action against employees for proper

(5)Relieve an employee from duties because of lack
of work or other legitimate reason;
(6)Maintain efficiency and productivity, including
maximizing the use of advanced technology, in
government operations;
(7)Determine methods, means, and personnel by which
employer's operations are to be conducted; and
(8)Take such actions as may be necessary to carry
out the missions of employer in cases of
emergencies.
This subsection shall not be used to invalidate
provisions of collective bargaining agreements in effect on
and after June 30, 2007, and shall not preclude negotiations
over the procedures and criteria on promotions, transfers,
assignments, demotions, layoffs, suspensions, terminations,
discharges, or other disciplinary actions as a permissive
subject of bargaining during collective bargaining
negotiations or negotiations over a memorandum of agreement,
memorandum of understanding, or other supplemental
agreement.
Violations of the procedures and criteria so
negotiated may be subject to the grievance procedure in the
collective bargaining agreement.
Id. (emphases added).
HRS § 89-9(d) represents the legislature's balance
between policies of requiring employers to fulfill their "public
responsibility[,]" which would include consistency with the merit
principle, and a public policy of "allow[ing] the public
employees and their employers free range in negotiating the terms
of their contract[.]"  State of Hawai# i Org. of Police Officers
(SHOPO) v. Soc'y of Prof'l Journalists-Univ. of Hawai# i Chapter,
83 Hawai# i 378, 403, 927 P.2d 386, 411 (1996) (citation omitted). 
In regard to the latter, permitting parties to empower an
arbitrator to grant remedial promotions makes their CBA "that
much more meaningful, since the confidence of the workers in the
equity of the agreement is strengthened when they know that any
dispute over the meaning of the contract may be submitted to an
impartial third party for decision."  UHPA, 66 Haw. at 223, 659
P.2d at 727 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
"HRS § 89–9(d)[(1993)] contains an exception to the
merit system principle that authorizes the employer and exclusive
representative to specify grievance procedures related to FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
promotions and demotions."9 Hoopai v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 106 
Hawai'i 205, 223, 103 P.3d 365, 383 (2004). The Hoopai court 
held: 
Based on the statute's plain language, HRS § 89–9(d)
generally prohibited Employers and the [employee union]
from negotiating a collective bargaining agreement
"inconsistent with merit principles" including provisions
that interfere with the rights of an employer to promote,
transfer or demote employees. As signified by the word
"provided" in HRS § 89–9(d), however, this prohibition is
subject to two qualifications permitting the employer and
the exclusive representative to (1) negotiate, inter alia,
 
promotion and demotion procedures and (2) a grievance
process to remedy violations of such procedures.
 
Hoopai, 106 Hawai 'i at 221, 103 P.3d at 381 (emphasis added). 
Although the Hoopai holding was based on a prior and
 
different version of HRS § 89-9(d), the legislative history of
 
HRS § 89-9(d) shows that subsequent amendments strengthened
 Hoopai's interpretation of HRS § 89-9(d) as excepting
 negotiations over promotions and grievance processes from the
 general requirement of consistency with the merit principle. See
 
2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 58, § 1 at 100-01; Hoopai, 106 Hawai
'i 
at 223, 103 P.3d at 368. Critics interpreted Act 58 (S.B. 1642)
 as enlarging the scope of issues subject to collective bargaining
 negotiations and eroding the scope of management rights.
10
 
Amendments to HRS § 89-9(d) in 2007 did not invalidate Hoopai's
 relevant holding on exceptions to the merit principle but rather 
strengthened Hoopai's interpretation.
11 See Hoopai, 106 Hawai 'i 
9 HRS § 89-9(d) does not reserve an exclusive right to management to
determine promotion procedures. See Univ. of Hawaii Professional Assembly v.
Univ. of Hawaii, 66 Haw. 207, 211-12, 659 P.2d 717, 719-20 (1983); S. Stand.
Comm. Rep. No. 745, in 1970 Senate Journal, at 1332 ("[T]here is no reason to
limit the scope of negotiation insofar as terms agreed to in the course of

 On April 24, 2007, State of Hawai' i Governor Linda Lingle vetoed
S.B. 1642 because "it constitutes an unacceptable infringement upon managementrights[.]" Governor's Message No. 793, "Statement of Objections to SenateBill No. 1642," in 2007 Senate Journal, at 805-06. In accordance with article III, section 17 of the Hawai' i Constitution, the Senate issued an override of
the Governor's veto. See S.B. No. 1642, S.D. 1, H.D. 1, 2007 Senate Journal, 
at 892-93.

 Because Hoopai applies to our interpretations of public policy
 
exceptions under HRS § 89-9(d) before and after 2007, we need not determine
whether the 2003-2007 or the 2007-2011 version of the CBA was the appropriate
document.

In 2007, the Hawai 'i legislature amended pertinent 
provisions of HRS § 89-9(d) by removing the following passage: 
The employer and the exclusive representative  may negotiate
procedures governing the promotion and transfer of employees
to positions within a bargaining unit; the suspension,
demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary actions taken
against employees within the bargaining unit; and the layoff
of employees within the bargaining unit. Violations of the
 procedures so negotiated may be subject to the grievance
procedure in the collective bargaining agreement. 
2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 58, § 1 at 100-01 (emphasis added). 
This passage was replaced with language stating,

 
"[t]his subsection shall not be used to invalidate provisions of
 
collective bargaining agreements in effect on and after June 30,
 2007, and shall not preclude negotiations over the procedures and
 criteria on promotions[.]" HRS § 89-9(d). We note that in the
 instant case, CBAs dated July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2007 and July 1,
 2007 - June 30, 2011 were effective, alternately, "on" and
 "after" June 30, 2007; the arbitrator recognized his authority to
 act under Article 32 of both CBAs; and therefore HRS § 89-9(d)
 amendments applied to the arbitrator's actions under the CBAs.
 
The legislature's 2007 amendments to HRS § 89-9(d) were 
made in light of United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL­CIO v. Hanneman, 106 Hawai
'i 359, 105 P.3d 236 (2005), wherein 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that management rights under HRS 
§ 89-9(d) precluded collective bargaining over the City and County of Honolulu's unilateral decision to transfer refuse workers. See 2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 58, § 1, at 100-01. Under 
Hanneman, the scope of topics subject to negotiation cannot "infringe upon an employer's management rights under [HRS § 89­9(d)]." Hanneman, 106 Hawai
'i at 365, 105 P.3d at 242. The 
purpose of the 2007 amendments was to clarify that management rights enumerated in HRS § 89-9(d) do not invalidate or preclude negotiations concerning agreements on "procedures and criteria on promotions, transfers, assignments, demotions, layoffs, suspensions, terminations, discharges, or other disciplinary actions[.]" See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 889, in 2007 Senate 
Journal, at 1438 ("[t][he purpose of this measure is to amend 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[HRS § 89-9(d)] by clarifying that certain statutory actions
 
shall not be used to invalidate collective bargaining agreements
 in effect on and after June 30, 2007, and such actions may be
 included in collective bargaining agreements."). The Senate
 Committee stated: 
In interpreting the Hanneman case, one cannot
disregard the [collectively bargained Memoranda of
Agreements (MOA)] that determined the transfer of theseemployees. Therefore, the transfer was found to be inconcert with these MOAs. The MOAs were allowed under [HRS §89-9(d)], and therefore, either party had the right toexercise their rights under these MOAs. Your Committee believes that the Hawaii [Hawai' i] Supreme Court was
upholding the management rights as derived from the MOAs. 
However, some have viewed the Hanneman case allowing
management rights generally whether or not MOAs are
involved.
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 889, in 2007 Senate Journal, at 1438. 
This legislative report discloses an intent to address an interpretation of HRS § 89-9(d) under Hanneman that would allow management rights irrespective of their existence under an agreement. Under this interpretation of Hanneman, promotions fell within the scope of management rights under HRS § 89-9(d) and would therefore lie outside of the scope of the CBA and the arbitrator's authority to act under it. Hanneman, 106 Hawai
'i at 
365, 105 P.3d at 242. 
The House Committee on Labor & Public Employment found
 
that 1988 amendments to HRS § 89-9(d) "expand[ed] the scope of
 collective bargaining in the public sector . . . [and] was
 intended to protect contract provisions that would otherwise be
 considered invalid due to a literal interpretation of what are
 considered to be management rights." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 1465, in 2007 House Journal, at 1595. The House Committee
 understood proposed amendments in 2007 were meant to "clarify the
 rights of public employees to engage in collective bargaining
 under [HRS Chapter 89], in light of recent court decisions,
 [Hoopai and Hanneman]." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1465, in 2007
 House Journal, at 1595. 
Consistent with the legislative intent of 2007
 
amendments, we interpret the CBA in light of new provisions of
 the amended HRS §89-9(d).
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Article 11 of the CBA provided: "[t]he Employer
 
reserves and retains, solely and exclusively, all management
 
rights and authority, including the rights set forth in [HRS
 § 89-9(d)(1)-(8)], except as specifically abridged or modified by
 this Agreement."
 
Article 47(B) required that promotions be based on
 
merit and "consistent with applicable civil service statutes,"
 which include HRS §§ 76-1 and 89-9(d).
 
Article 32(L)(9)(b)(2) authorized the arbitrator "to
 
decide whether the Employer has violated, misinterpreted or
 misapplied any of the terms of [the CBA] and in the case of any
 action which the Arbitrator finds unfair, unjust, improper or
 excessive on the part of the Employer, such action may be set
 aside, reduced or otherwise changed by the Arbitrator." The
 arbitrator interpreted this provision as authorizing him "to
 grant the promotions as part of the remedy to resolve the
 grievances[.]"
 
Employer contends the arbitrator exceeded his powers
 
under HRS § 89-9(d), which retains promotions as a management
 right that lies outside of the scope of the CBA. Subsequent
 amendments to HRS § 89-9(d), however, clarified that CBA
 provisions in effect on or after June 30, 2007 would not be
 invalidated under HRS § 89-9(d). Article 11 of the CBA is
 consistent with the amended HRS § 89-9(d) inasmuch as it stated
 Employer's management rights under HRS § 89-9(d) would be
 retained "except as specifically abridged or modified by this
 Agreement."
 
Provisions under Article 11 for Employer's retention of
 
its "management rights" under HRS § 89-9(d) absent specific
 abridgment or modification must be read in concert with Article
 32, which authorized the arbitrator to determine "whether the
 Employer violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied any of the terms
 of this [CBA]" and to "determine whether the Arbitrator has
 jurisdiction to act" in disputes over arbitrability.
 
Our review of the arbitrator's construal of the CBA
 
must consider policies of judicial deference. UHPA, 66 Haw. at

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
225, 659 P.2d at 728 ("[T]he fact that an arbitrator may err in 
applying the law, finding facts, or in construing the contract, or enters an award that is contrary to the evidence adduced, is insufficient grounds for judicial reversal."). Employer, by agreeing to submit to arbitration, "assume[d] all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law and in their findings of fact." Daiichi Hawaii Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 
Hawai
'i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003) (citation, internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The arbitrator's remedial promotions were authorized
 
under the plain language of Article 32 of the CBA. Article 32
 defined the scope of the arbitrator's authority, which included
 deciding whether Employer violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied
 the CBA. The arbitrator found the oral interview portion of
 KPD's promotion process "was subjective, arbitrary and
 capricious[ ]" contrary to Article 47 of the CBA. Accordingly,
 the arbitrator was authorized to "set aside, reduce[], or
 otherwise change[]" Employer's denial of promotions to Grievants. 
Also pursuant to Article 32, the arbitrator was authorized to
 "award back pay to recompense in whole or in part, the employee
 for any salary or financial benefits lost, and return to the
 employee such other rights, benefits, and privileges or portions
 thereof as may have been lost or suffered." (Emphasis added.)
 The arbitrator determined Grievants "were denied promotion to the
 Sergeant/Detective position due to subjective, arbitrary and
 capricious promotional practices" and awarded them remedial
 promotions. Under Article 32, the arbitrator was authorized to
 "return to" Grievants the right, benefit or privilege of their
 promotions that they lost due to the oral interview procedure,
 which he found improper. 
In light of the legislative intent in amending HRS
 
§ 89-9(d) to clarify "management rights," and CBA provisions
 granting the arbitrator broad authority to remedy grievances, we
 conclude the arbitrator's award did not exceed his authority and
 the circuit court erred in failing to so conclude.
