NO. CAAP-10-0000078
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LYNN MARIE DIONISE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0293)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lynn Marie Dionise (Dionise)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered on
 
August 12, 2010, by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 
1
(Circuit Court),  after Dionise entered a guilty plea on the
charge of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 712-1242(1)(b). 
Dionise was sentenced to ten (10) years of incarceration to be
 
served "consecutively to any other sentence that defendant may be
 
serving."
 
On appeal, Dionise contends that: 
(1) the Circuit 
Court failed to comply with State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai' i 495, 
229 P.3d 313 (2010), and (2) Dionise's consecutive sentence was excessive under the circumstances.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Dionise's points of error as follows:
 
In Hussein, the Hawai' i Supreme Court unequivocally 
mandated that "after the filing date of the judgment herein, 
circuit courts must state on the record at the time of sentencing 
the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence." Id. at 510, 
229 P.3d at 328 (emphasis added). The State acknowledges that Dionise was sentenced after the judgment became effective in 
Hussein, but the Circuit Court did not comply with the supreme 
court's directive at the time of Dionise's sentencing. Instead, 
the State argues that the Circuit Court's later statement of 
reasons, at the time that Dionise's motion for reconsideration of 
sentence was denied, was sufficient to "ultimately comply" with 
the supreme court's mandate. 
Under the circumstances of this case, we decline to, in
 
effect, modify the supreme court's ruling to excuse the timing
 
requirement, i.e., that reasons for imposing a consecutive
 
sentence be stated at the time of sentencing. Therefore, we
 
vacate the consecutive portion of Dionise's sentence and remand
 
for resentencing before another judge. Accordingly, we need not
 
reach the other issue raised by Dionise.
