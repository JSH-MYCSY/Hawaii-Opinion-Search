(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0565)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Alexander Y. Marn, appearing pro
 
se, appeals from the following three orders entered by the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court):  (1) the
Amended Final Judgment, which was entered on September 20, 2010
 
and found in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee McCully Associates
 
(McCully Associates), a Hawaii Limited Partnership, as to its
 
claims for interpleader, specific performance, and an order
 
directing conveyance of title that arose from agreements of sale
 
for a piece of real property; (2) the "Order Granting Plaintiff
 
McCully Associates's Motion for Notice of Entry of Amended Final
 
Judgment;" and (3) the "Order Denying Alex Y. Marn's Motion to
 
Compel Production of Documents and to Hold the Proposed Draft
 
Orders for the Release of Funds in Abeyance Until Alex Marn's
 
Accountant Reviews all Supporting Documentation Requested."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Alexander Marn asserts the following issues on appeal:
 
(1) whether McCully Associates presented sufficient evidence that
 
it had made all of the payments called for in the agreement of
 
sale; (2) whether Alexander Marn was entitled to see records
 
pertaining to whether McCully Associates made all of the payments
 
required by the agreement of sale and whether these payments
 
complied with the terms of the agreement; (3) whether McCully
 
Associates was in default under the agreement of sale for
 
purportedly failing to make certain monthly payments; (4) whether
 
the denial of Alexander Marn's request for evidence of payment
 
under the agreement of sale was an abuse of discretion by the
 
Circuit Court and whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion
 
by failing to order McCully Associates to produce a "particular
 
accounting," and; (5) whether McCully Associates's refusal to
 
provide documentation related to the agreement of sale payments
 
was arbitrary and prejudicial, entitling Alexander Marn to a new
 
trial, and whether McCully Associates's court-appointed
 
liquidating receiver abused his office by refusing Alexander
 
Marn's request for this documentation.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Alexander Marn's
 
points of error as follows:
 
Alexander Marn may not assert any defenses to his
 
liability without first being relieved from his default. 
Occidental Underwriters of Hawaii, Ltd. v. Am. Sec. Bank, 5 Haw.
 
App. 431, 433, 696 P.2d 852, 854 (1985). A default judgment
 
should be set aside when a court finds:
 
(1) that the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by
the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a
meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not the
result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.

BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 77, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150
 
(1976). "Furthermore, if a movant fails to meet any one prong of
 
the test, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing
 
to set aside a default judgment." Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v.
 
Bartolome, 94 Haw. 422, 439, 16 P.3d 827, 844 (App. 2000). Here,
 the Circuit Court did not err in denying Alexander Marn's motion
 
to set aside the default because he did not demonstrate that it
 
was not the result of inexcusable neglect or a willful act.
 
First, when questioned by the Circuit Court, Alexander
 
Marn was unable to provide a reasonable explanation for his
 
default and, to the contrary, admitted that he knew that he was
 
required to respond to the complaint.
 
Second, the record does not support Alexander Marn's
 
contentions that he was confused as to whether Mr. Sutton would
 
be representing him in this matter because the parties' hearing
 
testimony indicated that they all knew that the scope of
 
Mr. Sutton's representation did not extend to the interpleader
 
case.
 
Moreover, Alexander Marn's argument that his confusion 
was exacerbated because McCully Associates, in response to 
Alexander Marn's demand for documents in November 2006, 
corresponded with Alexander Marn's attorney in the main Marn 
Family Litigation cases does not provide a basis for finding 
excusable neglect because, at that time, the instant case had not 
yet been filed and Alexander Marn was represented by counsel in 
the main proceeding. Accordingly, McCully Associates's legal 
representatives were obligated to communicate with Alexander Marn 
only through his counsel. See Hawaif i Rules of Professional 
Conduct Rule 4.2; see also Cook v. Surety Life Ins., Co., 79 Hawaifi 403, 411, 903 P.2d 708, 716 (App. 1995). 
Although Alexander Marn requested certain records,
 
these requests came either before the filing of the interpleader
 
complaint (and, thus, cannot demonstrate an intent to defend) or
 
after default judgment was entered (that is, after the time to
 
defend had passed). Additionally, Alexander Marn's argument that
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
he expected McCully Associates to provide the records rings
 
hollow given McCully Associates's explicit refusal to honor
 
Alexander Marn's pre-litigation requests.
 
Alexander Marn's assumption that the McCully Associates
 
receiver was obligated to bring the alleged breach to the
 
attention of the court also is unpersuasive because, even
 
assuming that the McCully Associates receiver was obligated to
 
bring Alexander Marn's concerns to the court, once the
 
interpleader action was filed, it was unreasonable for Alexander
 
Marn to rely on this assumption in choosing not to answer the
 
complaint. See, generally, Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S.
 
331, 356 (2006) (noting "the importance of procedural default
 rules in an adversary system, which relies chiefly on the parties
 
to raise significant issues and present them to the courts in the
 
appropriate manner at the appropriate time for adjudication").
 
Finally, after giving Alexander Marn a chance to
 
explain his default, the Circuit Court voiced its suspicions
 
regarding the timing of Alexander Marn's intervention, noting
 
that he only came forward when there was a discussion of funds
 
and that it appeared to be a last-minute attempt to delay the
 
proceedings.
 
Given these factors, the Circuit Court did not abuse
 
its discretion in denying Alexander Marn's motion to set aside
 
the default judgment and he was not entitled to raise any
 
defenses to his liability.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the September 20, 2010
 
Amended Final Judgment, the "Order Granting Plaintiff McCully
 Associate's Motion for Notice of Entry of Amended Final
 
Judgment," and the "Order Denying Alex Y. Marn's Motion to Compel
 
Production of Documents and to Hold the Proposed Draft Orders for
