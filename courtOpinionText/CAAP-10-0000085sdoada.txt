KAREN A. OSHIRO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1P109-12182)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.; and
Leonard, Presiding J., dissenting)
 
Defendant-Appellant Karen A. Oshiro ("Oshiro") appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order ("Judgment"),
 
filed on September 22, 2010 in the District Court of the First
 Circuit, Honolulu Division ("District Court").
1 Oshiro was
 
charged by complaint with harassment, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 711-1106(1)(b) and/or (1)(f) (Supp.
 2010).
2 After a bench trial, the District Court found Oshiro

 HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) and (1)(f) provide as follows:
 
Harassment.  (1) A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any
other person, that person:
 
. . . .
 
(b)	 Insults, taunts, or challenges another person in
a manner likely to provoke an immediate violent
response or that would cause the other person to
reasonably believe that the actor intends to
cause bodily injury to the recipient or another
or damage to the property of the recipient or
another; [or]
 
(f)	 Makes a communication using offensively coarse
language that would cause the recipient to

guilty as charged of both the HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) and (1)(f)
 
means of committing harassment.3 The District Court sentenced
 
Oshiro to six months of probation, subject to the condition that
 she obtain an anger-management assessment and any treatment
 deemed necessary; imposed a $150 fine; and a prohibition against
 committing any federal or state crime while on probation.
 
On appeal, Oshiro contends that (1) there was
 
insufficient evidence to convict her of Harassment and (2) the
 District Court plainly erred by failing to dismiss the charge as
 de minimis, pursuant to HRS § 702-236 (1993).

 Despite the fact that the District Court explicitly convicted
Oshiro under both HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) and (1)(f), the Judgment reflects
conviction only under HRS § 711-1106(1)(b). As a result, we remand the case
to the District Court to amend the Judgment to correct a clerical error under
Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 36.

De minimus infractions.  (1) The court may dismiss a
prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the conduct
alleged and the nature of the attendant circumstances, it
finds that the defendant's conduct: 
Was within a customary license or tolerance,
which was not expressly refused by the person
whose interest was infringed and which is not
inconsistent with the purpose of the law
defining the offense; or 
(a)
 
(b) Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or
 
evil sought to be prevented by the law defining
the offense or did so only to an extent too
trivial to warrant the condemnation of
 conviction; or 
(c) Presents such other extenuations that it cannot
 
reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the
legislature in forbidding the offense. 
(2) The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under
 
subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a written
statement of its reasons.

AW. REV. STAT. § 702-236 (1993).
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
affirm the Judgment and resolve Oshiro's points of error as
 follows:
 
(1) Oshiro contends that she did not possess the 
requisite intent to harass, annoy or alarm the complaining witness ("CW"). "[T]he mind of an alleged offender[, however,] may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 
92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (citations omitted) (quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai' i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 (1997)). 
Given the evidence, it is reasonable to infer that
 
Oshiro intended to harass, annoy, or alarm the CW when, as the
 District Court found, Oshiro reached over the fence that divided
 their properties to pull on a tree branch in the CW's yard;
 referred to the CW three to four times as "you fuckin' bitch" in
 a very angry tone of voice; stated after her son's voice was
 heard – and again in a very angry tone – that "I can knock the
 fuckin' bitch down"; and that she (Oshiro) could do anything she
 wanted so long as she stayed in her own yard. Oshiro was four to
 five feet away from the CW with a four-foot high chain link fence
 between them during the incident. In addition, those
 communications were reasonably determined to be of an offensively
 coarse nature that caused the CW to reasonably believe that
 Oshiro intended to cause bodily injury to the CW or damage to the
 CW's property. 
We conclude that when viewed in the light most
 
favorable to the prosecution, as we must, there was substantial
 evidence to support Oshiro's conviction. See State v. Tamura, 63
 
Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981). In sum, we do not
 agree with Oshiro that the elements of HRS § 711-1106(1)(b)
 and/or (f) were not met. 
(2) Oshiro did not move the District Court to dismiss 
the charge as a de minimis infraction under HRS § 702-236. The decision to dismiss a charge pursuant to HRS § 702-236 rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Ornellas, 79 
Hawai'i 418, 423, 903 P.2d 723, 728 (App. 1995). As a general 
rule, an argument not raised in the trial court will be deemed to have been waived on appeal. State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). As a result, we decline to
 
consider Oshiro's argument that her harassment charge should have
 been dismissed as a de minimis infraction, which she raises for
 the first time on appeal.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Judgment filed on
 
September 22, 2010 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division, is affirmed. Furthermore, the case is
 remanded to the District Court for amendment of the Judgment in a
 form consistent with that announced by the District Court on the
 date of the Judgment's entry.
