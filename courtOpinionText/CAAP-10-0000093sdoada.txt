IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LAURENCE CHAM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 10-1-1677)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lawrence Cham (Cham) appeals from
 
the Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Amended
 
Judgment) filed on October 15, 2010, in the Family Court of the
 First Circuit (Family Court).
1 Cham was convicted of abuse of a
 
family or household member, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ยง 709-906 (Supp. 2011).
 
On appeal, Cham contends that the Family Court:
 
(1) committed plain error by improperly commenting on the
 evidence in its specific unanimity instruction; and (2) erred in
 advising the jury that they would be provided lunch if they
 deliberated beyond 11:30 a.m. We affirm.
 
1/ The Honorable Edward H. Kubo, Jr., presided.

I.
 
We resolve the arguments raised by Cham on appeal as
 
follows:
 
A.
 
Even assuming, arguendo, that the Family Court's 
specific unanimity instruction contained an improper comment on 
the evidence, any such error was harmless. Based on State v. Nomura, 79 Hawai' i 413, 417, 903 P.2d 718, 722 (App. 1995), we 
conclude that "[t]he other instructions provided a barrier to any improper influences from the court's comment that may have prejudiced Defendant." 
B.
 
We reject Cham's contention that the Family Court
 
committed prejudicial error by informing the jury, before
 instructing the jury at the close of the case, that "[i]f you
 guys deliberate and it takes you until 11:30, the State of Hawaii
 will buy you lunch." Cham argues that the Family Court's
 
2
statement amounted to an Allen  charge,  which the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court has held is improper to give. See State v. Gonsalves
, 108 
Hawai'i 289, 294, 119 P.3d 597, 602 (2005). 
Cham's argument that the Family Court's statement
 
amounted to an improper Allen charge is without merit. Cham
 cites no authority for the proposition that the Family Court is
 prohibited from informing the jury that lunch will be provided if
 the jury's deliberations extend into lunchtime. The Family
 Court's innocuous advisement to the jury regarding lunch was not
 improper and did not prejudice Cham's substantial rights.
 
2/ The terms "Allen charge" or "Allen instruction" are derived from the
United States Supreme Court decision in Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492
(1896). The Hawai' i Supreme Court has described the Allen charge as "an
instruction to a deadlocked jury that directs minority jurors to reconsidertheir views in light of the views of the majority[,]" and it noted that suchcharge "became increasingly popular because of 'its perceived efficacy as ameans of 'blasting' a verdict out of a deadlocked jury.'"

108 Hawai' i 289, 294, 119 P.3d 597, 602 (2005) (block quote format, citation,
