IN THE MATTER OF MARCUS F. ROSEHILL,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE THE JANUARY 6, 2011
MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Petitioner-Appellee Marvi M.
 
Rosehill Ching's (Appellee Ching) January 6, 2011 motion to
 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-10-0000100 for lack of
 
jurisdiction, and (2) the record, we decline at this preliminary
 
stage in this appeal to adjudicate all of the issues raised in
 
Appellee Ching's January 6, 2011 motion to dismiss Appellant
 
Rosehill's appeal from the Honorable Rom A. Trader's
 
September 22, 2010 judgment.
 
We note that the September 22, 2010 judgment is 
certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b) of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and, thus, the September 22, 2010 judgment is an appealable final judgment under 
Rule 34 (a) of the Hawai 'i Probate Rules (HPR) and Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010). With respect to the thirty-day time period for filing a notice of appeal under 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
the thirtieth calendar day after September 22, 2010, was Friday, October 22, 2010, which was a furlough day for all state courts, 
and, thus, HRAP Rule 26(a) extended the thirty-day time period 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal until 
Monday, October 25, 2010. See Order Regarding the Closure of All 
Hawai
'i State Courts (Hawai 'i Oct. 23, 2009). Appellant 
Rosehill's October 25, 2010 notice of appeal, therefore, was 
timely. A valid appeal from the September 22, 2010 judgment 
would entitle Appellant Rosehill to appellate review of all 
interlocutory orders that related to the September 22, 2010 
judgment, because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up 
for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of 
right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski, 
107 Hawai 'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
However, an issue exists whether Appellant Rosehill is 
entitled to assert an appeal because Appellant Rosehill is not 
licensed to practice law as an attorney in Hawai 'i. It appears 
that one of the issues in this appeal is whether Appellant Rosehill, as a non-attorney, has been entitled to participate, as 
a pro se litigant, in this litigation. We prefer to adjudicate 
this issue after the parties have the opportunity to address it 
in their appellate briefs. Therefore, we decline to rule on this 
issue until the parties in this appeal have filed their appellate 
briefs. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we deny Appellee Ching's
 
January 6, 2011 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 
2
 CAAP-10-0000100 for lack of jurisdiction, but we do so without
 
prejudice to the parties' further addressing in their appellate
 
briefs the issue of whether Appellant Rosehill can appear without
 
counsel in this litigation.
