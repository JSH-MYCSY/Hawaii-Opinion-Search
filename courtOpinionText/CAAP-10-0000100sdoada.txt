Appellee Marvi M. Rosehill Ching (Ching) pursuant to Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b). 
Rosehill, a co-trustee to the "Violet-Marie M. Rosehill 
Revocable Living Trust Agreement" dated December 23, 1986 (the 
Trust), timely filed a notice of appeal. However, Rosehill is 
not licensed to practice law as an attorney in Hawai' i; 
therefore, he is not entitled to assert an appeal in his capacity as a co-trustee of the Trust. Although Rosehill designates 
himself as "Federal Protector" in his Notice of Appeal, his 
involvement in this case is based on his status as a co-trustee 
of the Trust. Moreover, in his opening and reply briefs, 
Rosehill designates himself as trustee. Accordingly, Rosehill's 
October 25, 2010 notice of appeal is not valid for the purpose of 
invoking the jurisdiction of this court. 
In trust litigation, "[t]he general rule is that a
 
trustee may not represent the trust in litigation unless, having
 
the right sought to be enforced, he is the real party in
 
interest." Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256,

 HRS § 605-2 provides in relevant part:
 
§605-2 Attorneys; license required.  Except as provided by
the rules of court, no person shall be allowed to practice in any
court of the State unless that person has been duly licensed so to
do by the supreme court; provided that nothing in this chapter
shall prevent any person, plaintiff, defendant, or accused, from
appearing in person before any court, and there prosecuting or
defending that person's, plaintiff's, defendant's, or accused's
own cause, without the aid of legal counsel[.]

 HRS § 605-14 provides in pertinent part:
 
§605-14 Unauthorized practice of law prohibited. It shall
 
be unlawful for any person, firm, association, or corporation to
engage in or attempt to engage in or to offer to engage in the
practice of law, or to do or attempt to do or offer to do any act
constituting the practice of law, except and to the extent that
the person, firm, or association is licensed or authorized so to
do by an appropriate court, agency, or office or by a statute of
the State or of the United States.

represent the Trust, Rosehill must show "that he [is] the sole
 
beneficiary of the trust," and thus, the real party in interest. 
Tradewinds Hotel, Inc., 8 Haw. App. at 265, 799 P.2d at 66
 
("Defendant had the burden of showing that the cause was his,
 
i.e., that he was the real party in interest. It was incumbent
 
on him to show that he was the sole beneficiary of the trust by
 
introducing the unrecorded trust document.").
 
The record provides that Rosehill and his sister,
 
Ching, are beneficiaries to the Trust, as well as successor co­
trustees. Rosehill fails to show that he is the sole beneficiary
 
of the Trust. As such, he may not represent the Trust. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT this appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
