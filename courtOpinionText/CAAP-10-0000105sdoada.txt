IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SUNG SIK CHOI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 10-1-1375)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sung Sik Choi (Choi) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on July 21, 2010 in
 
the Family Court of the First Circuit (family court).1
 
The family court found Choi guilty of Harassment, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1106(1)(a)
 
(Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, Choi contends (1) there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict him of Harassment and (2) the family court
 
erred by denying his motion for mistrial because the complaining
 
witness (CW) violated a motion in limine regarding prior bad
 
acts.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Choi's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) CW testified that Choi grabbed her arm when she 
would not let him hold his child. He then pushed CW onto a bed 
and forcibly took the child. The family court found the 
testimony of CW to be credible. "It is well-settled that an 
appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the 
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is 
the province of the trier of fact." State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 
85, 90, 976 P.2d 399, 404 (1999) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 
130, 134, 976 P.2d 444, 448 (App. 1999)). 
"[T]he mind of an alleged offender may be read from his 
acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." Stocker, 90 Hawai' i at 92, 976 P.2d at 406 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai' i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 (1997)). Given the 
circumstantial evidence, it is reasonable to infer that Choi intended to harass, annoy, or alarm CW by striking, shoving, 
kicking, or otherwise touching CW in an offensive manner or by 
subjecting CW to offensive physical contact. 
(2) The family court did not err by denying Choi's
 
motion for mistrial. CW violated the family court's order
 
granting Choi's motion in limine, which prohibited the
 
introduction of Choi's prior bad acts. Choi based his motion for
 
mistrial on this violation. However, any introduction of prior
 
bad acts was harmless. Choi's case was tried without a jury. 
When finding Choi guilty of Harassment, the family court did not
 
mention Choi's prior bad act. "[W]here a case is tried without a
 
jury, it is presumed that the presiding judge will have
 
disregarded the incompetent evidence and relied upon that which
 
was competent." State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 355, 615 P.2d 101,
 
108 (1980). Choi does not point to anything in the record to

rebut the presumption that the family court disregarded
 
incompetent evidence.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on July 21, 2010 in the Family Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
