APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1671)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Michael David Sakatani, Christine
 
Marie Sakatani, and 808 Development, LLC (Plaintiffs-Appellants)
 
appeal from the October 14, 2010 "Order Granting 'Counsel for
 
Defendants Glen Nobuki Murakami, Ann Sue Isobe, and 4902 Kahala
 
LLC's Motion For Attorney's Fees and Costs Against All
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Plaintiffs,' Filed June 22, 2010," (Order Granting Fees and
 
1
Costs) filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
court) in favor of Defendants-Appellees Glen Nobuki Murakami, Ann
 
Sue Isobe, and 4902 Kahala LLC (Defendants-Appellees) and against
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants.
 
On appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants contend the circuit
 
court abused its discretion when it awarded attorney's fees and
 
costs to Defendants-Appellees. 
Plaintiffs-Appellants assert that
 
the award was based on an erroneous dismissal of the foreclosure
 lawsuit, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to make the award,
 
the foreclosure action was not in the nature of assumpsit, and
 
the Defendants-Appellees were not the prevailing parties.
 
On July 17, 2009, Plaintiffs-Appellants filed a
 
complaint in circuit court in Civil No. 09-1-1671-07 for
 
foreclosure of a fourth mortgage against Defendants-Appellees.
 
On May 12, 2010, the circuit court entered its "Final
 
Judgment as to All Claims and as to All Parties," (Final
 
Judgment) dismissing Plaintiffs-Appellants' complaint. The Final
 
Judgment made no reference to attorney's fees and costs.
 
On June 4, 2010, Plaintiffs-Appellants filed a notice
 
of appeal from the May 12, 2010 Final Judgment.
 
On June 22, 2010, Defendants-Appellees filed a post-
judgment motion for attorney's fees and costs. The circuit court
 
heard the motion on July 27, 2010 and entered the Order Granting
 
Fees and Costs on October 14, 2010. On October 21, 2010,
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants filed their notice of appeal from the Order
 
Granting Fees and Costs.
 
"Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests 
the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA 
Intern. Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 
735 (1999). "Notwithstanding the general effect of the filing of 
a notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to 
1

determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, and 
may act in aid of the appeal." Id. For example, even while a 
case is on appeal, the circuit court retains jurisdiction to enforce the judgment or to approve a supersedeas bond to stay a 
judgment. MDG Supply, Inc. v. Diversified Investments, Inc., 51 
Haw. 375, 381, 463 P.2d 525, 529 (1969); see Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 62(d). 
It is well-established, however, that while a case is 
on appeal, a lower court does not retain jurisdiction to rule on 
a motion for attorney's fees and costs. Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai' i 
475, 486, 960 P.2d 145, 156 (App. 1998) ("While a case is on appeal, the lower court lacks jurisdiction to decide any 
questions pertaining to attorney fees arising out of or relating 
to the matter on appeal."). However, the holding in Wong "does 
not apply where court rules provide a specific definition of 
timeliness for motions requesting attorney's fees." Cox v. Cox, 
125 Hawaii 19, 28 n.14, 250 P.3d 775, 785 n.14 (2011) (referencing HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B), which provides that motions 
for fees under that rule "must be filed and served no later than 
14 days after entry of an appealable order or judgment[.]"). 
Defendants-Appellees failed to file their motion for attorney's 
fees within the time allowed under HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B). 
Furthermore, Plaintiffs-Appellants had filed their
 
notice of appeal on June 4, 2010. Thus, when Defendants-
Appellees filed their post-judgment motion for attorney's fees
 
and costs on June 22, 2010, the circuit court had already lost
 
jurisdiction over the case. We conclude that the 
October 14, 2010 Order Granting Fees and Costs entered by the
 
circuit court is void because it lacked jurisdiction.
 
We do not address Plaintiffs-Appellants' other points
 
of error because appellate review of this appeal is limited to
 
review of the October 14, 2010 post-judgment Order Granting Fees
 
and Costs and any orders that directly led to the Order Granting

Fees and Costs. See Cook v. Surety Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai' i 
403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995).
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 14, 2010 "Order
 
Granting 'Counsel for Defendants Glen Nobuki Murakami, Ann Sue
 Isobe, and 4902 Kahala LLC's Motion For Attorney's Fees and Costs
 
Against All Plaintiffs,' Filed June 22, 2010," filed in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit is vacated.
