IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOSEPH D. VILLIARIMO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 08-1-0035(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Joseph D. Villiarimo (Villiarimo) appeals the
 
September 30, 2010 Order of Resentencing Revocation of Probation
 
entered by the Family Court of the Second Circuit (Family
 
Court).1
 
On appeal, Villiarimo contends that the Family Court
 
(1) abused its discretion in denying his request for a 
continuance to obtain the presence of a doctor at the Hawai' i 
State Hospital (HSH) to testify and (2) abused its discretion in revoking probation where the evidence did not support a willful 
and inexcusable failure to comply with the conditions of 
probation. 
1. The Family Court did not abuse its discretion by
 
denying the continuance. The trial court's ruling on a motion to
 
continue will not be disturbed on appeal without a showing of

abuse of discretion. State v. Gager , 45 Haw. 478, 488, 370 P.2d
 
739, 745 (1962). 
In moving for a continuance based on the unavailability of a
witness, the movant must generally show that:
 
due diligence has been exercised to obtain the
attendance of the witness, that substantial favorable
evidence would be tendered by the witness, that the
witness is available and willing to testify, 
and that
 
the denial of the continuance would materially
prejudice the defendant.
 
State v. Lee, 9 Haw. App. 600, 604, 856 P.2d 1279, 1282 (App.
 
1993) (emphasis added). After reviewing the record in this case,
 
we find no such abuse.
 
2. The Family Court did not abuse its discretion in 
revoking probation where it did not err in its findings and was 
not wrong in its conclusion that Villiarimo inexcusably failed to 
comply with conditions of probation. A circuit court's decision 
that a defendant failed to comply with a substantial requirement 
imposed as a condition of an order of probation is a finding of 
fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. State v. 
Reyes, 93 Hawai' i 321, 327, 2 P.3d 725, 731 (App. 2000); State v. 
Lazar, 82 Hawai' i 441, 443, 922 P.2d 1054, 1056 (App. 1996); 
HRS ยง 706-625(3) (Supp. 2012) ("The court shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a 
substantial requirement imposed[.]"). It is for the trial court 
to make credibility assessments, resolve conflicts in testimony 
and draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence. State v. 
Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996). 
Villiarimo admits that "his psychotic disorder was
 
triggered by his relapse," that is to say, Villiarimo's use of
 illicit drugs. Villiarimo does not contest that his actions
 
subsequent to the relapse and during his psychotic disorder
 
constituted violations of probation conditions, nor does he deny
 
that his use of illicit drugs was of his own volition. 
Consequently, where the relapse ultimately was the admitted cause
 
of Villiarimo's psychotic disorder under which Villiarimo took
 
the actions that violated his conditions of probation, that

relapse was properly considered by the Family Court in the
 
Probation Revocation proceeding--notwithstanding that the same
 
taking of illicit drugs was also the basis for a previous
 
revocation proceeding. Accordingly, the Family Court's finding
 
in this regard was not clearly erroneous.
 
Villiarimo also argues that insufficient evidence
 
existed for the Family Court to conclude that Villiarimo's
 
failure to comply with the stated conditions of probation was
 
willful and inexcusable, in essence arguing that evidence of his
 
psychotic disorder renders his noncompliance non-willful and
 
excusable.
 
A circuit court's decision that the failure to comply 
with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of an order 
of probation was inexcusable is a conclusion of law reviewed de 
novo under the right/wrong standard. Reyes, 93 Hawai' i at 327, 2 
P.3d at 731; Lazar, 82 Hawai' i at 443, 922 P.2d at 1056. "A 
conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings 
of fact and that reflects an application of the correct rule of 
law will not be overturned." Reyes, 93 Hawai' i at 327, 2 P.3d at 
731 (quoting Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 119, 839 P.2d 10, 29 (1994)) (internal quotation marks and 
brackets omitted). 
The principles of voluntary intoxication that "a mental 
disability excusing criminal responsibility must be the product 
of circumstances beyond the control of the defendant," State v. 
Freitas, 62 Haw. 17, 20, 608 P.2d 408 410 (1980), and that 
voluntary intoxication is not a defense to criminal conduct, 
State v. Souza, 72 Haw. 246, 249, 813 P.2d 1384, 1386 (1991), are 
analogous and applicable to the instant situation. Under 
HRS ยง 706-625, "[a] defendant's willfulness is an indicator of 
culpability." State v. Wong, 73 Haw. 81, 87, 829 P.2d 1325, 1328 
(1992). HRS ยง 702-230 "prohibits the jury from considering self-induced intoxication to negate the defendant's state of mind" 
State v. Birdsall, 88 Hawai' i 1, 4, 960 P.2d 729, 732 (1998) 
(citation omitted). "Willful" is tantamount to an "intentional" 
3

mental state. See State v. Brown, 70 Haw. 459, 465, 776 P.2d
 
1182, 1186 (1989) ("willfulness in a context of criminal contempt
 
means a deliberate or intended violation") (citation, internal
 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). In consideration of the
 
foregoing, Villiarimo's voluntary intoxication (i.e., his use of
 
drugs) and the psychosis--which he confirms was "self-induced
 
because [h]e used drugs," and which was a direct consequence of
 
the voluntary intoxication, as admitted by Villiarimo (his
 
relapse in use of drugs "triggered" the psychotic
 
disorder)--cannot be a defense to his willfulness, as an
 
indicator of culpability, in violating of the conditions of his
 
probation. Hence, the Family Court's conclusion that Villiarimo
 
"inexcusably" violated the specified terms of his probation was
 
not wrong.
 
Therefore, the Family Court of the Second Circuit's
 
September 30, 2010 Order of Resentencing Revocation of Probation
 
is affirmed.
