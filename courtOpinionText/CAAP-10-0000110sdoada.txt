SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard, J.;
with Reifurth, J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Diane S. Siangco (Siangco) appeals
 
from the October 18, 2010, Judgment for Possession entered in
 
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Federal National Mortgage Association
 (FNMA) that was filed in the District Court of the Second Circuit
 (District Court).
1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
On August 12, 2010, FNMA filed a first amended verified
 
complaint for ejectment against Siangco. FNMA alleged that it
 was the fee simple owner of the subject property by virtue of a

non-judicial foreclosure sale held on August 26, 2009, and the
 
subsequent recording on March 10, 2010, of a "Mortgagee's
 Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale," which identified FNMA
 as the "Grantee." The complaint asserted that Siangco was
 wrongfully occupying the subject property without FNMA's consent
 or permission and despite written notice to vacate. FNMA prayed
 for a Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession. 
On September 28, 2010, the District Court entered its:
 
(1) "Order Granting Plaintiff Federal National Mortgage
 Association's Motion for Summary Judgment for Ejectment and Writ
 of Possession" (Order Granting FNMA's MSJ); and (2) "Order
 Denying Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendant Siangco" (Order
 Denying Siangco's MSJ). On October 18, 2010, the District Court
 entered the Judgment for Possession and a Writ of Possession in
 favor of FNMA.
 
II.
 
Siangco's principal argument on appeal is that the
 
District Court erred in issuing the Order Granting FNMA's MSJ,
 the Order Denying Siangco's MSJ, the Judgment for Possession, and
 the Writ of Possession because FNMA lacked standing to bring the
 ejectment action. Siangco claims that FNMA lacked standing
 because the underlying non-judicial foreclosure sale from which
 FNMA derives its interest in the subject property was invalid on
 the ground that the mortgagee, who was the successful bidder,
 made a credit bid rather than a downpayment. Siangco also argues
 that the District Court erred in issuing the Order Granting
 FNMA's MSJ because there were genuine issues of material fact
 that preclude summary judgment.
 
We resolve Siangco's arguments as follows:
 1. We reject Siangco's argument that the underlying 
non-judicial foreclosure sale was invalid because the successful
 mortgagee bidder made a credit bid rather than a downpayment. 
Siangco's argument that the successful bidder was required to

make a downpayment is based on Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 667-5.7 (Supp. 2010), which provides:
 
At any public sale pursuant to section 667-5, the
successful bidder at the public sale, as the purchaser,
shall not be required to make a downpayment to the
foreclosing mortgagee of more than ten percent of the
highest successful bid price.
 
Siangco interprets this language as requiring that the successful
 
bidder make a downpayment.
 
However, the plain language of the statute refutes
 
Siangco's interpretation. The statue provides that "the
 successful bidder . . . shall not be required to make a
 downpayment . . . of more than ten percent of the highest
 successful bid price." HRS § 667-5.7 (emphasis added). By its
 clear terms, HRS § 667-5.7 simply imposes a limitation on the
 downpayment that can be demanded; it does not require that the
 successful bidder make a downpayment or preclude the mortgagee
 from making a credit bid. 
Our conclusion is supported by Angel v. BAC Home Loans 
Servicing, LP, Civ. No. 10–00240 HG–BMK, 2011 WL 1230413 (D. Haw. March 30, 2011). In Angel, the United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i similarly held that "HRS § 667–5.7 sets a 
ceiling on the amount a bidder may be required to pay as a downpayment, but it does not impose a requirement that a downpayment be made or otherwise prohibit credit bids." Id., 
2011 WL 1230413, at *5. Because HRS § 667-5.7 does not require that a successful mortgagee bidder make a downpayment for a non-judicial foreclosure sale to be valid, Siangco's contention that FNMA lacked standing to bring the ejectment action is without merit. 
2. We reject Siangco's contention that her
 
declaration in opposition to FNMA's motion for summary judgment
 raised genuine issues of material fact that precluded summary
 judgment. Siangco's declaration did not raise any valid defenses
 to FNMA's motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the District
 Court did not err in determining that there were no genuine

issues of material fact and that FNMA was entitled to judgment as
 
a matter of law.
 
III.
 
We affirm the Judgment for Possession and the Writ of
 
Possession that were filed by the District Court on October 18,
 2010.
