SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Walter V. Rodenhurst, III,
 
(Rodenhurst) appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
Law, and Order Denying Petition Without a Hearing" (Order Denying
 Petition), which was filed on September 29, 2010, in Special
 Prisoner Proceedings (SPP) Nos. 09-1-0097, 09-1-0098, and 
09-1-0099, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 Court).
1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
On August 26, 2003, Rodenhurst was sentenced in four
 
separate criminal cases as follows: (1) in Criminal No. 99-0229,
 ten years of incarceration on Count III for first degree theft,
 with a mandatory minimum term of ten years as a repeat offender,
 and one year of incarceration on Counts I and II for negotiating

a worthless negotiable instrument; (2) in Criminal No. 00-1-0457, 
an extended ten-year term of incarceration for second degree theft, with a mandatory minimum term of five years as a repeat offender; (3) in Criminal No. 01-1-0943, an extended ten-year term of incarceration on Counts I and II for second degree theft, with a mandatory minimum term of five years as a repeat offender; and (4) in Criminal No. 03-1-0343, an extended ten-year term of incarceration on Counts I though V for second degree forgery (Counts I, III, and IV) and second degree theft (Counts II and V), with a mandatory minimum term of three years and four months as a repeat offender on Counts I and II. The Circuit Court
2 
imposed the sentences in all cases and on all counts to run concurrently. The Judgments in Criminal Nos. 99-0229, 00-1-0457, 
01-1-0943, and 03-1-0343 were filed on August 26, 2003. Rodenhurst did not file a direct appeal of his convictions or sentences in any of these cases. Accordingly his convictions and sentences became final on September 25, 2003. See Loher v. 
State, 118 Hawai» i 522, 535 n.13, 193 P.3d 438, 451 n.13 (App. 
2008). 
On December 31, 2009, Rodenhurst filed essentially the
 
same "Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to
 Release Petitioner for [sic] Custody" (Petition) in SPP No. 09-1­0097 regarding Criminal No. 03-1-0343, in SPP No. 09-1-0098
 regarding Criminal No. 00-100457, and in SPP No. 09-1-0099
 regarding Criminal No. 01-1-0943. In each Petition, Rodenhurst
 alleged two grounds for relief:
 
1. Ground one: "Conviction obtained by plea of
 
guilty which was unlawfully induced or not made voluntarily or
 
with understanding of the nature and the consequences of the
 plea." 
2. Ground two: "The imposition of a sentence which
 
is constitutionally unsound or under a statute of the State which 
2 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided over Rodenhurst's
sentencing.
 
2
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has been found to have constitutional defects necessitating a
 
correction of sentence."
 
On September 29, 2010, the Circuit Court issued its 
Order Denying Petition, which denied the separate Petitions filed in SPP Nos. 09-1-0097, 09-1-0098, 09-1-0099 without a hearing, pursuant to Hawai» i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(f) 
(2006). 
II.
 
On appeal, Rodenhurst argues: (1) that his extended 
term sentences are invalid under Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 
466 (2000) and State v. Maugaotega , 115 Hawai» i 432, 168 P.3d 562 
(2007) (hereinafter, "Maugaotega II "); and (2) the Circuit Court 
erred in failing to make specific findings in support of its 
decision to impose extended terms of imprisonment. 
Upon review of the record and the briefs submitted by
 
the parties, we hold as follows:
 
1. Rodenhurst cannot challenge his extended term 
sentences based on Apprendi  or Maugaotega II. Prior to its 
decision in Maugaotega II , the Hawai» i Supreme Court had 
repeatedly held that Hawai» i's extended term sentencing scheme 
complied with Apprendi . See Maugaotega II, 115 Hawai» i at 437­
42, 168 P.3d at 567-72; Loher, 118 Hawai» i at 536, 193 P.3d at 
452. Thus, based on controlling precedent of the Hawai» i Supreme 
Court, Rodenhurst's extended term sentences were not invalid under Apprendi at the time they were imposed. 
In Maugaotega II, the Hawai» i Supreme Court held that 
the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction and its analysis regarding 
the necessity finding, which it had consistently followed in concluding that Hawai» i's extended term sentencing scheme was 
constitutional under Apprendi , could no longer be applied in 
light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Cunningham 
v. California, 549 U.S. 270 (2007). See Maugaotega II, 115 
Hawai» i at 442-47, 168 P.3d at 572-77. Based on Cunningham , the 
Hawai» i Supreme Court in Maugaotega II  overruled its prior 
precedents and concluded that the extended term sentencing scheme 
3
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was unconstitutional. Maugaotega II , 115 Hawai» i at 445-47, 168 
P.3d at 575-77. However, Maugaotega II  does not apply 
retroactively to Rodenhurst's collateral attack of his extended 
term sentences. See State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai'i 308, 312-14, 113 
P.3d 184, 188-90 (2005); Loher , 118 Hawai» i at 534-38, 193 P.3d 
at 450-54; United States v. Cruz , 423 F.3d 1119, 1120-21 (9th 
Cir. 2005). Thus, Rodenhurst cannot challenge his extended term sentences based on Maugaotega II . 
The statutes under which Rodenhurst's extended term 
sentences were imposed were not void ab initio. See State v. 
Jess, 117 Hawai» i 381, 386-89, 406-15, 184 P.3d 133, 138-41, 158­
67 (2008); State v. Cutsinger , 118 Hawai» i 68, 79-82, 185 P.3d 
816, 827-830 (App. 2008), overruled in part on other grounds by 
Jess, 117 Hawai» i at 398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; Loher, 118 
Hawai» i at 534-38, 193 P.3d at 450-54. In Jess, the Hawai» i 
Supreme Court held that the trial court had the authority to 
resentence Jess to extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to the former version of the extended term sentencing statute, HRS ÿÿ 706-662 (Supp. 1996), which was in effect in 2000 when Jess committed the charged offenses, by the trial court's invoking its inherent judicial power to empanel a jury to make the "necessity" finding. Jess, 117 Hawai» i at 386-89, 410-13, 184 P.3d at 138­
41, 162-65; see also State v. Mark, 123 Hawai» i 205, 249-50, 231 
P.3d 478, 522-23 (2010). The supreme court could not have reached this conclusion in Jess if the former versions of HRS ÿÿ 706-662 applicable to the sentencings of Jess and Rodenhurst were void ab initio. 
2. We do not address Rodenhurst's argument that the 
Circuit Court erred in failing to make specific findings in 
support of its decision to impose extended terms of imprisonment. Rodenhurst waived this argument by failing to raise it in a direct appeal from the Judgments in the underlying criminal cases 
or in the Petitions he filed. See Hawai» i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 40(a)(3) (2003); State v. Moses , 102 Hawai» i 449, 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) (stating that as a general rule, an 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argument not raised at trial will be deemed to have been waived
 
on appeal). 
III.
 
We affirm the Order Denying Petition that was filed on
 
September 29, 2010, by the Circuit Court in SPP Nos. 09-1-0097,
 09-1-0098, and 09-1-0099.
