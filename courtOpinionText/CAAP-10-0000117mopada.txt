APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1193)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Dave Brown (Brown) appeals from the
 
"Final Judgment in Favor of Defendants State of Hawai' i, Melanie 
Chinen, Bob Awana, Ashley Chinen and Against Plaintiff Dave
 
1
Brown"  (Judgment) filed on December 9, 2010 in the Circuit Court
1
 Brown filed his October 29, 2010 notice of appeal prematurely, after
the circuit court's announcement that it intended to enter final judgment, but
prior to entry of the December 9, 2010 Final Judgment. The Hawai' i Supreme
Court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders havebeen reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of andagainst the appropriate parties pursuant to [Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure]
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115,
119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Nevertheless, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure Rule 4(a)(2) authorizes a premature notice of appeal: "If a noticeof appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before its entry ofthe judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediatelyafter the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal."Furthermore, "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review allinterlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal withissues in the case."

of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  Judgment was entered 
pursuant to the "1) Order Granting Defendant Ashley Chinen's 
Motion For Summary Judgment Filed 05-01-2009 and Denying 
Plaintiff's Motion To Continue Defendant Ashley Chinen's Motion 
for Summary Judgment Filed 06-16-2009 filed July 23, 2009, 2)

4) Order Granting Defendants Melanie Chinen and Bob Awana (In 
Their Official Capacities), and State of Hawaii's Motion to

Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants-Appellees State of 
Hawai'i (State), Melanie Chinen (Chinen), Bob Awana (Awana), and 
Ashley Chinen (collectively, Appellees) and against Brown. 
On appeal, Brown contends:
 
(1)
 The circuit court erred in dismissing the case
 
rather than trying the case on its merits.
 
(2) The circuit court erred in dismissing the case on
 
jurisdictional grounds when Appellees had received notice of the
 retaliation charge in the separate action Brown filed in the
 
United States District Court for the District of Hawaii (federal
 
court).
 
(3) The circuit court erred in dismissing the case
 
when, even without the three missing pages, the June 13, 2008
 
Complaint (Complaint) provided sufficient notice to Appellees of
 
a cause of action for retaliation.
 
(4) The circuit court erred in dismissing the case
 
when the discovery that three pages of the Complaint were missing
 
"smell[ed] of dirty hands."
 
(5) The circuit court erred in denying Brown's "Motion
 
for Reconsideration of September 13, 2010 Oral Order Granting
 
[Appellees'] Motion to Dismiss."

I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 16, 2005, the State of Hawai' i Department 
of Land and Natural Resources State Historic Preservation 
Division (SHPD) hired Brown as the Branch Chief Archeologist 
under a one-year contract. Brown's contract expired on 
June 30, 2006 and was not renewed. During Brown's employment, 
Chinen was the SHPD administrator and Brown's direct supervisor. 
Prior to notifying Brown on June 13, 2006 that his contract would 
not be renewed, Chinen met with him to discuss her 
dissatisfaction with his work. 
On November 7, 2007, in federal court, Brown filed a 
Complaint (Federal Complaint) against Chinen, et al. Brown 
alleged that SHPD did not renew his contract in retaliation for 
his statements that SHPD procedures "were illegal, unethical, or 
culturally insensitive." Brown's claims included a First 
Amendment retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and a Hawai' i 
state retaliation claim under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-62 (Supp. 2011). On May 14, 2008, the federal court 
dismissed Brown's First Amendment retaliation claim but gave him 
leave to amend. It also dismissed Brown's Hawai' i state 
retaliation claim because the State had not consented to be sued in federal court. Brown eventually filed three amended 
complaints, each reasserting his First Amendment retaliation 
claim. On June 15, 2009, Chinen filed a motion for summary 
judgment as to Brown's First Amendment retaliation claim. The 
State, among other defendants, filed a joinder to Chinen's motion 
for summary judgment. On September 23, 2009, the federal court 
granted the State's motion for joinder and Chinen's motion for 
summary judgment as to Brown's First Amendment retaliation claim. 
Brown filed his Complaint in the instant case in
 
circuit court on June 13, 2008. He brought the action "under the
 
common law for negligence and intentional torts and Hawaii
 
Revised Statute for retaliation." He sought damages against the
 
State "for negligence and retaliatory firing." Inexplicably,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pages 26-28 of the Complaint were missing. Brown claims the
 
missing pages contained a claim of retaliation under HRS 
§ 378-62.
 
On December 11, 2008, Brown filed his First Amended
 
Complaint (Amended Complaint) in circuit court against Appellees. 
The Amended Complaint contained the claim for retaliation in
 
violation of HRS § 378-62. On October 7, 2009, the circuit court
 
granted Awana's motion for summary judgment in his individual
 
capacity. On July 23, 2009, Ashley Chinen's motion for summary
 
judgment was granted. On March 19, 2010, the circuit court
 
granted summary judgment to Chinen in her individual capacity. 
The only remaining cause of action was the HRS § 378-62
 
retaliation claim against the State and Chinen and Awana in their
 
official capacities.
 
On September 8, 2010, Appellees filed a Motion to
 
Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that (1) Brown's
 
cause of action accrued on June 13, 2006 when Brown was notified
 
his contract would not be renewed, (2) the Complaint filed on
 
June 13, 2008 did not include Brown's HRS § 378-62 claim, (3)
 
Brown's First Amended Complaint, which for the first time
 
asserted the HRS § 378-62 claim, was not filed until 
December 11, 2008, after the two-year statute of limitations
 
under HRS § 662-4 (1993) had expired.
 
On September 13, 2010, the circuit court issued its
 
oral order granting Appellees' Motion to Dismiss. Brown filed a
 
"Motion for Reconsideration of the Oral Order" on 
September 23, 2010, which the circuit court denied on 
September 29, 2010. On October 26, 2010, the circuit court
 
issued its written order granting Appellees' Motion to Dismiss. 
The circuit court entered its Final Judgment on December 9, 2010.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is
reviewed de novo. Bremner v. City & County of Honolulu, 96
Hawai‘i 134, 138, 28 P.3d 350, 354 (App. 2001). The court
 
must accept plaintiff's allegations as true and view them in
the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is
proper only if it “appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim
that would entitle him or her to relief.” Dunlea v. Dappen,
83 Hawai‘i 28, 32, 924 P.2d 196, 200 (1996), overruled on
other grounds by Hac v. Univ. of Hawai‘i, 102 Hawai‘i 92,
105–06, 73 P.3d 46, 59–60 (2003) (citations omitted).
 
Wong v. Cayetano, 111 Hawai'i 462, 476, 143 P.3d 1, 15 (2006).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The primary question on appeal is whether Brown's HRS
 
§ 378-62 retaliation claim was sufficiently presented in the
 
Complaint. HRS § 662-4 states that "[a] tort claim against the
 
State shall be forever barred unless action is begun within two
 
years after the claim accrues[.]"  It is undisputed that the
 
statute of limitations for Brown's claim under HRS § 378-62 began
 
to run June 13, 2006 and Brown timely filed the Complaint on June
 
13, 2008, within the two-year deadline. Brown's Amended
 
Complaint, which asserted a HRS § 378-62 claim for the first
 
time, was not filed until December 11, 2008, after the two-year
 
statute of limitations had run.
 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 15(c) 
provides that an amended claim is not barred by the statute of 
limitations if the amendment relates back to the date of the 
original pleading. HRCP Rule 15(c) states, in relevant part: 
(c) Relation back of amendments. An amendment of a
 
pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading
when
 
(1) relation back is permitted by the law that
provides the statute of limitations applicable to the
action, or
(2) the claim or defense asserted in the amended
pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or
occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the
original pleading[.]
 
As long as the original claim alleged facts that
 
properly put a party on notice of the subsequent claim, the
 
statute of limitations "is satisfied, regardless of when the
 
claim itself is asserted." Mauian Hotel, Inc. v. Maui Pineapple
 
Co., 52 Haw. 563, 566, 481 P.2d 310, 313 (1971). The reasoning
 behind the HRCP Rule 15(c) exception to a statute of limitations
 
is that "pleading the occurrence will properly notify the other
 
party of what evidence to gather." Id. at 568, 481 P.2D at 314.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court established the following 
test to determine whether an amendment to a claim arises out of 
the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the original 
claim: "[U]nder [HRCP] 15(c)[,] any amendment requiring 
additional evidentiary proof which was not reasonably foreseeable 
from the earlier pleadings should be deemed to contain a new 
occurrence." Mauian Hotel, Inc., 52 Haw. at 568, 481 P.2d at 
314. 
In the instant case, Appellees were notified by the
 
original pleadings, in this case the Complaint, of the HRS 
§ 378-62 retaliation claim. In the Complaint, Brown stated in
 
the first paragraph that he was bringing action for retaliation
 
and was seeking damages against the State for retaliatory firing. 
He asserted that SHPD did not renew his contract because he had
 
"voiced his opinion that numerous practices at SHPD were illegal,
 
unethical, or culturally insensitive."
 
Under the Complaint's negligent supervision claim, 
Brown alleged that "[a]s a proximate result of the negligent
 
hiring, training, and supervision of [Appellees], [Brown]
 
suffered from the incompetent actions [of Chinen] to include loss
 
of constitutional rights, and retaliation[,]" and "[a]s a
 
proximate result of the negligence of defendants, [Brown's]
 
employment at SHPD was not renewed."
 
In the Amended Complaint, Brown alleged that
 
"[Appellees] retaliated against [Brown] by fabricating false
 
testimony for pretextual reasons to silence, intimidate, and
 
discredit [Brown] from making legitimate complaints about
 
illegal, unethical and culturally insensitive practices[,]" and
 
"[a]s a proximate result of the retaliation, [Brown's] job was
 
not renewed beyond June 30, 2006." The allegations made in the
 
Amended Complaint under the HRS § 378-62 retaliation claim did
 
not require additional evidentiary proof other than what
 
Appellees would have otherwise gathered in light of the original
 
Complaint. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, we conclude that the Complaint's negligent
 
supervision claim and the Amended Complaint's retaliation claim
 
are based on the same occurrence, as required under HRCP Rule
 
15(c). The negligent supervision claim in the Complaint stems
 
from Chinen's alleged mismanagement of SHPD and the alleged
 
failure to renew Brown's employment due to retaliation. The
 
retaliation claim in the Amended Complaint is based on the very
 
same occurrence, namely the failure to renew Brown's employment
 
due to alleged retaliation. Because Appellees were put on notice
 
by the allegations in the Complaint to gather evidence related to
 
the retaliation claim, the circuit court erred in granting
 
Appellees' September 8, 2010 Motion to Dismiss.

The Final Judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees 
State of Hawai' i, Melanie Chinen, Bob Awana, and Ashley Chinen
