Terminating the Parental Rights of [Father] and [Mother] and
 
Awarding Permanent Custody filed on September 29, 2010 in the
 
1

I. BACKGROUND
 
On October 2, 2009, Petitioner-Appellee the Department
 
of Human Services (DHS) filed a Petition for Foster Custody and
 Family Supervision over WR and KL (the Children). 
KL is the
 
natural child of Father, and the father of WR is unknown. At the
 time of the petition, Mother was in a treatment program and
 
Father was facing further incarceration.
 
On October 12, 2009, the family court issued an Order
 
Awarding Temporary Foster Custody, Temporary Family Supervision
 
and Setting the Matter for Continued Hearing, granting temporary
 
foster custody and family supervision over the Children to DHS.

 The Honorable Calvin K. Murashige presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The family court granted Father and Mother's request for a
 
continuance to find and retain counsel.
 
On December 1, 2009, DHS filed an Ex Parte Motion to
 
Set the Matter for Extraordinary Review Hearing to change the
 
status of the Children. DHS alleged that Father had recently
 
been sentenced to five years of imprisonment and was incarcerated
 
and Mother had recently relapsed into substance abuse and had
 
also been incarcerated. 
At a hearing on April 1, 2010, Michael Soong appeared
 
on behalf of Father, who did not appear because he was
 
incarcerated. The court clerk's minutes for April 1, 2010 show
 
that "Mr. Soong stated that Father's minimum term may be one year
 
8 months" and the family court "noted that parents may
 
participate by telephone at the upcoming hearings." On April 6,
 
2010, the family court entered an Order Continuing Foster Custody
 
and Setting the Matter for an Order to Show Cause Hearing, which
 
hearing the court ordered all parties to attend on May 27, 2010.
 
At the May 27, 2010 hearing, Father was not present,
 
but was represented by Mr. Soong. The court clerk's minutes for
 
May 27, 2010 state:
 
Mr. Soong stated that he once represented both Mother &
Father and that they are going to divorce each other.
Because of this, Mr. Soong feels that there is a conflict of
interest and will be moving to withdraw as counsel for
Father. Also, no minimum term has been established for
Mother as of yet. Court instructed Mr. Soong to file an Ex
Parte Motion to Withdraw as Counsel and give [Father]
notice. Once the motion to withdraw is granted, [Father]
can apply for the services of an attorney and if he
qualifies, one will be appointed. Mrs. Hasegawa shall
provide an application for counsel to Mr. Soong and
Mr. Soong will be responsible for providing said application
to [Father].
 
On May 28, 2010, the family court filed an Order Continuing
 
Existing Orders and Setting the Matter for Permanency Planning, 
ordering all parties to appear on August 26, 2010 for a Permanent
 
Plan hearing.
 
The court clerk's minutes for the August 26, 2010
 
hearing state:

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mr. Soong stated that Father is presently in Suaro [sic] in
Arizona. He represented at the last hearing that he
represented both parties in criminal matters and now that
parties are getting a divorce and this case concerns their
children, he would have a conflict and will be moving to
withdraw. He was informed to contact Father and file and
 [sic] ex parte motion. He indicated that he did speak to
Father about two weeks ago who indicated that he would be
either submitting an application for CCA or retaining
private counsel. Mr. Soong stated that he will be filing an
Ex Parte Motion to Withdraw as Counsel. 
The court continued matter to 9/23/2010 at 1 pm.
 
The court clerk's minutes for September 23, 2010 state:
 
Mr. Soong moved to withdraw as counsel for [Father] and
presented argument. State had no objection to Mr. Soong's
request to withdraw. Court granted the oral motion.
 . . . . 
Mr. Goo [the Deputy Attorney General] requested the
following findings & order: that the existing service plan
and prior award of foster custody be revoked; that [Father]
be defaulted for his non-appearance at today's hearing; that
the parental and custodial duties and rights of [Mother],
[Father] and Unknown Father be divested; that DHS be awarded
permanent custody; that [TC] be made a party to the above-
entitled proceedings and be appointed foster parent; that
each term set forth in Permanent Plan #1 dated 8/26/10 be
ordered and attached as Exhibit "a" and made a part of this
order; that all previous exhibits entered into evidence be
admitted provided that the parties reserve the right to
cross-examination thereon; that [Father] and [Mother] be
dismissed as parties to this case; that Rosa Flores be
thanked and excused as counsel for mother; that the Review
Hearing that's scheduled for 9/30/10 at 1 p.m. be vacated
and that all remaining parties return for a periodic review
hearing on 3/17/11 at 1 p.m. Court ordered the findings as
requested by the State as well as the Order as proposed.
 
[Guardian Ad Litem] Ms. Baki noted that it's very important
that the children remain together.
 
Court noted that [Father] was given ample notice of this
hearing and was given a[n] opportunity to apply for a court
appointed attorney in sufficient time to submit his
application and non [sic] was turned in. Court found that
 reasonable efforts were made to allow [Father] to still be a
party in this matter but he has not taken advantage of said
opportunity.
 
On September 29, 2010, the family court issued an Order
 
Terminating the Parental Rights of [Father] and [Mother] and
 
Awarding Permanent Custody. The family court ordered that Father
 
was defaulted for non-appearance and "was provided notice and an
 
application for court appointed counsel and none was received."
 
Father filed a Notice of Appeal on October 29, 2010.

The family court issued its Findings of Fact on
 
November 17, 2010. 
II. DISCUSSION
 
"The sanction of a default or default judgment is a
 
harsh one." In re TW, 124 Hawaif i 468, 472, 248 P.3d 234, 238 
(App. 2011) (quoting Rearden Family Trust v. Wisenbaker, 101
 
Hawaifi 237, 254, 65 P.3d 1029, 1046 (2003)). In In re TW, this 
court stated:
 
The United States Supreme Court has stated that it is
"plain beyond the need for multiple citation that a natural
parent's desire for and right to the companionship, care,
custody, and management of his or her children is an
interest far more precious than any property right" and
constitutes a "fundamental liberty interest." Santosky v.
 
Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 758-59, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d
599 (1982) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
"The rights to conceive and to raise one's children have
been deemed essential [and] basic civil rights of
man . . . ." Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.
Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). The United States Supreme Court has
further observed that "parental termination decrees are
among the most severe forms of state action," M.L.B. v.
 S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 128, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473
(1996), and that "[a] parent's interest in the accuracy and
justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental
status is . . . a commanding one." Lassiter v. Department
 
of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 27, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L.
Ed. 2d 640 (1981).
 
Similarly, the Hawaif i Supreme Court has "affirm[ed],
independent of the federal constitution, that parents have a
substantive liberty interest in the care, custody, and
control of their children protected by the due process
clause of article [I], section 5 of the Hawaif i 
Constitution." In re Doe, 99 Hawaif i at 533, 57 P.3d at
458. The Hawaif i Supreme Court further stated: 
Parental rights guaranteed under the Hawaif i 
Constitution would mean little if parents weredeprived of the custody of their children without afair hearing. Indeed, parents have a fundamentalliberty interest in the care, custody, and managementof their children and the state may not deprive aperson of his or her liberty interest withoutproviding a fair procedure for the deprivation.Furthermore, the [United States] Supreme Court hassaid that parental rights cannot be denied without an
opportunity for them to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father was represented by counsel up to the start of
 
the hearing on September 23, 2010. However, when Father's
 
counsel made an oral motion to withdraw at the beginning of the
 
hearing and the family court granted the motion, Father should
 
have been provided additional time to request representation and
 
should not have been defaulted for failing to appear.
 
On May 27, 2010, the family court had ordered Father's
 
counsel to submit an ex parte motion to withdraw and provide
 
Father with notice. Father's counsel was also ordered to provide
 
Father with an application form to request appointment of
 
counsel. There is nothing in the record to indicate that
 
Father's counsel complied with the family court's order.
 
On August 26, 2010, Father's counsel had not yet filed
 
a motion to withdraw, but stated to the family court that he
 
would file one. Father's counsel represented to the family court
 
that he had spoken with Father and Father would request appointed
 
counsel or retain private counsel.
 
On September 23, 2010, Father's counsel made an oral
 
motion to withdraw, rather than filing an ex parte motion to
 
withdraw as the family court had previously instructed. There is
 
nothing in the record to indicate that Father's counsel provided
 
Father, who was not present because he was incarcerated in
 
Arizona, with notice that counsel would move to withdraw on
 
September 23, 2010.
 
It was an abuse of discretion by the family court to 
default Father for failing to appear at the September 23, 2010 
hearing when his counsel's oral motion to withdraw was made and 
granted. In re Doe, 95 Hawaif i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001) (brackets in original omitted) ("The family court disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.").
