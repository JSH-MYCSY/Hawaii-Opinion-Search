STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ORLANDO PECPEC, aka ORLANDO V. PECPEC,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-1598)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Orlando Pecpec, also known as
 
Orlando V. Pecpec, (Pecpec) appeals from the Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence filed on September 3, 2010 in the Family
 
Court of the First Circuit (family court).1 A jury found Pecpec
 
guilty of Violation of an Order for Protection, in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-11(a)(1)(A) (Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, Pecpec contends 
(1) the jury instructions were devoid of specific
 
unanimity instructions and thus the verdict was not unanimous;
 
(2) the verdict was not supported by the evidence; and

(3) the family court illegally sentenced Pecpec under
 
HRS § 586-11(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) as a repeat offender.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Pecpec's
 
points of error as follows:
 
We need only address Pecpec's first point on appeal.2
 
Pecpec is correct in his contention that the jury was not
 
properly instructed to unanimously agree on an act constituting
 
the offense. In this instance, there were two possible acts of
 
prohibited conduct that Pecpec could have violated: contacting
 
Andrea Demauro (Demauro) or being within a hundred feet of her. 
The family court read the following instruction as to the charged
 
offense to the jury: "[O]n or about June 13, 2010 . . . [Pecpec]
 
intentionally or knowingly engaged in certain conduct, namely
 
contacting Andrea Demauro and/or coming within 100 feet from
 
her[.]" (Emphasis added.)
 
[W]hen separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed
within a single count . . . -- any one of which could
support a conviction thereunder -— and the defendant is
ultimately convicted by a jury of the charged offense, the
defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous verdict is
violated unless one or both of the following occurs: (1) at
or before the close of its case-in-chief, the prosecution is
required to elect the specific act upon which it is relying
to establish the "conduct" element of the charged offense;
or (2) the trial court gives the jury a specific unanimity
instruction, i.e., an instruction that advises the jury that
all twelve of its members must agree that the same
underlying criminal act has been proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 Pecpec incorrectly characterizes his second point on appeal as an
argument that the verdict was not supported by the evidence. The issue is a
 minor clerical error on the bottom of the verdict form, which was improperly
labeled "ABUSE OF FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS." The jury instructions,
charge, and evidence presented concerned the proper charge of Violation of an
Order for Protection. Such an error is harmless.

State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 32-33, 928 P.2d 843, 874-75 (1996) 
(footnote omitted). 
The State of Hawai' i (State) does not dispute that the 
"and/or" language of the jury instruction demonstrated that the 
State had not elected a specific act, as required by Arceo. 
Pecpec and the State also agree that the family court did not 
provide the jury with specific unanimity instructions apprising 
the jury that it must rely on the same act or conduct in finding 
Pecpec guilty of violating the protective order. Without an 
election by the State or an unanimity instruction as required 
under Arceo, it is unclear whether the jury relied on the same 
act or conduct in finding Pecpec guilty. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on September 3, 2010 in the Family Court of
 the First Circuit is vacated and this case is remanded for a new
 
trial.
