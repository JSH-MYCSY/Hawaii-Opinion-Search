OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JAMES LAURETA RETUTAL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
SARAH KAMAILE RETUTAL, now known as Hatori, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 09-1-1130)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant James Laureta Retutal (Husband)
 
appeals from the Decree Granting Absolute Divorce (divorce
 
decree) entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family
 
Court) on October 5, 2010.1
 
On appeal, Husband argues that: (1) the Family Court
 
erred in including in the divorce decree: paragraph 32: "[i]n the
 
event either party intentionally failed to disclose any assets
 
held on the effective date of this decree the other party is
 
awarded the entirety of the asset as his or her sole or separate
 
property[,]" and paragraph 11(d): "[t]he above entitlements to
 
wife shall apply to [Husband's] retirement accounts including any
 
subsequently discovered accounts not previously disclosed on
 
Husband's filed financials[;]" and (2) the Family Court erred in
 
making Findings of Fact (FOF) numbers 7, 8, and 14, and
 
Conclusions of Law (COL) numbers 2 and 3.

After a careful review of the points raised, arguments
 
made, the record and the applicable authority, we resolve
 
Husband's appeal as follows and affirm.
 
The heart of Husband's argument is that it was error
 
for the Family Court to include in the divorce decree terms that
 
he did not agree to. However, he does not cite to any authority
 
in support of his proposition.2 This court has previously held, 
Thus, a family court, proceeding pursuant to an approved
settlement agreement, is not authorized to enter a provisionthat is either contrary to the settlement agreement orprejudicial to a party regarding an issue on which theagreement was silent. See [Bienvenue v. Bienvenue, 102 Hawai'i 59, 69-70, 72, 72 P.3d 531, 541-42, 544 (App.
2003)]; see also Nakata v. Nakata, 3 Haw. App. 51, 56, 641P.2d 333, 336 (1982) ("If at the time the divorce wasgranted the lower court decided to change the Agreementbefore incorporating it into the decree, it would have beenrequired to obtain the consent of both parties or to movethe case from the uncontested calendar to the contested calendar."). A family court is authorized, however, toaugment the settlement agreement by adding reasonable,nonsubstantive enforcement provisions. Bienvenue, 102 
Hawai'i at 71-72, 72 P.3d at 543-44. 
Kumar v. Kumar, No. CAAP-12-0000691, 2014 WL 1632111 at *10 (App.
 
Apr. 23, 2014) (mem).
 
Both provisions at issue here are neutral, that is,
 
they apply equally to both parties. Therefore, they were not
 
"prejudicial to a party regarding an issue on which the agreement
 
was silent" and were "nonsubstantive enforcement provisions." 
Id. Thus, we conclude that Husband's challenge to paragraphs
 
11(d) and 32 are without merit.

 Rule 28(b)(7) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure requires
that the argument contain "citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of
the record relied on."

Our resolution of these issues make it unnecessary to 
address Husband's remaining points. 
Therefore, the Family Court of the First Circuit's 
October 5, 2010 Decree Granting Absolute Divorce is affirmed.
