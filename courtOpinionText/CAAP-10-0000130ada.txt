OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RICHARD M. LEVINSKY, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JONATHAN MCGEE, individually and as agent for
RAW PARADISE SANCTUARY CORPORATION,
Defendant-Appellant,
and

RAW PARADISE SANCTUARY CORPORATION,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-170)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
does not have jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Jonathan
 
McGee's (Appellant Jonathan McGee) appeal from the Honorable
 
Glenn S. Hara's October 25, 2010 Order Denying Defendant Jonathan
 
McGee's Motion for Legal Counsel (the October 25, 2010
 
interlocutory order), because the October 25, 2010 interlocutory
 
order is not independently appealable, and the circuit court has
 
not yet entered an appealable final judgment pursuant to Rule 58
 
of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2009) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals 
only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under 
HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the 
rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that 
"[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." 
Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i holds "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and 
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time 
the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. 
at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). The record on appeal for Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000130 was filed on January 3, 
2011, and the circuit court has not yet entered a separate 
judgment in this case. Absent a separate judgment, the 
October 25, 2010 interlocutory order is not eligible for 
appellate review. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay 
doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b), the 
October 25, 2010 interlocutory order does not satisfy the 
requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the 
collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai 'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order 
doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an 
2

appeal from an interlocutory order). With respect to the Forgay 
and collateral order doctrines, we note in particular that the 
October 25, 2010 interlocutory order does not subject a party 
such as Appellant Jonathan McGee to irreparable injury that is 
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Cf. 
Norton v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, State of Haw., 80 Hawai 'i 
197, 200, 908 P.2d 545, 549 (1996) ("The sixth amendment right to 
counsel applies only to criminal proceedings." (Citation 
omitted)). We additionally note that the circuit court did not 
certify the October 25, 2010 interlocutory order for an 
interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). Therefore, the 
October 25, 2010 interlocutory order is not an appealable order. 
Absent an appealable separate judgment, Appellant
 
Jonathan McGee's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000130. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
