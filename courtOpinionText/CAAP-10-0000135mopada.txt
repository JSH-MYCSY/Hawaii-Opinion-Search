APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Ema F. Komomua, now
 
known as Ema Z. Franco (Ema), appeals from (1) "Order Re: Trial,"
 
filed July 2, 2010 (Trial Order); (2) "Order Granting in Part and
 
Denying in Part Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration filed on
 
July 12, 2010," filed October 6, 2010 (Order Re: Royale's
 
Reconsideration Motion); (3) "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion
 
for Reconsideration, filed on October 18, 2010," filed November

(5) "Original Order to Withhold Income for Child Support," filed
 
November 26, 2010. All orders were filed in the Family Court of
 
1
the First Circuit  (family court).
Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant Royale K. Komomua
 
(Royale) cross-appeals from (1) "Order Denying Motion in Limine
 Regarding 816 Mokauea Street," filed May 4, 2010 (MIL Order); (2)
 
Trial Order; (3) Order Re: Royale's Reconsideration Motion; and
 
(4) Divorce Decree.
 
On appeal, Ema contends:
 (1) Family court erred in finding there was
 
insufficient evidence to determine the value of parties' interest
 in the Mokauea Property and concluding their ownership interest
 
was between 50% and 100% with no property equalization payment to
 
Ema. Finding of Fact (FOF) 66 is in error and Conclusions of Law
 
(COLs) 6 & 37 are wrong.
 
(2) Family court erred in using the 2004 Child Support
 
Guidelines (2004 Guidelines) to calculate child support. FOF 83
 
is in error and COL 25 is wrong.
 
(3) Family court erred by not determining an
 
exceptional circumstance to deviate child support from the 2004
 
Guidelines or in the alternative, the court should have increased
 
Ema's alimony in consideration of her child support obligation.
 
FOFs 79, 80, 81, and 83 are in error and COLs 23 and 25 are
 
wrong.
 
(4) Family court erred in ordering Ema to pay for the
 
children's private school tuition and post-high school
 
educational expenses in addition to child support. COLs 26 and
 
27 are wrong.
 
On cross-appeal, Royale contends family court erred 
(1) when it denied Royale's Motion in Limine (MIL)
 
Regarding 816 Mokauea Street (Mokauea Property) (MIL re: Mokauea

Property) on the grounds the court did not have jurisdiction over
 
real property owned by the Dorothy M. Komomua (Dorothy) Trust and
 
the Glenn A. Komomua Sr. (Glenn) Trust;
 
(2) in finding and concluding the Mokauea Property was
 
part of the marital estate, awarding said property to Royale,
 
offsetting the value of said property against the proceeds from
 
the sale of the Kula Kolea Property, and awarding the sale
 
proceeds from the Kula Kolea Property to Ema; and
 
(3) in awarding Ema 120 months of transitional alimony
 
at $1,200/month because there was significant and material change
 
in the financial positions of the parties from the May 7, 2008
 
Order awarding Ema temporary alimony to the May 10, 2010 trial. 
FOF 80 and 81 are in error and COL 23 is wrong.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Ema and Royale were married on April 25, 1987 in Maui. 
In 1991, they moved to Oahu and moved in with Royale's parents on
 
the Mokauea Property, which was small, old, and termite-ridden. 
By 1994, they had three children and began looking for a home to
 
purchase. After consultation with Royale's parents, Glenn and
 
Dorothy, and Royale's siblings, Royale decided to tear down the
 
current dwelling and build a new two-story house. To fund the
 
building of the house, Royale took out a $171,000 loan. He
 
signed the promissory note, and his parents signed the mortgage
 
to use the Mokauea Property as collateral. Royale obtained a
 
building permit as the owner/builder and signed a building
 
contract for $171,000. Upon completion in 1995, Royale's parents
 
lived downstairs and Royale, Ema, and their three children lived
 
upstairs. At trial, Royale testified he paid the mortgage, real
 
property taxes, and utilities.
 
In 2001, Royale refinanced the loan on the Mokauea
 
Property and used some of the money for a down payment on the
 
Kula Kolea Property. Royale's parents signed accommodation 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
mortgages for the Mokauea Property to be used as collateral for
 
the refinancing.
 
On August 23, 2007, Ema filed a Complaint for Divorce.
 
Pursuant to a May 7, 2008 pre-decree relief order, family court2
 
awarded Ema temporary alimony of $1,200/month and $4,000 from the
 net proceeds of the sale of the Kula Kolea Property to be used
 
for rent deposit. On April 29, 2010, Royale filed his MIL re:
 
Mokauea Property, which family court denied on May 4, 2010.
 
Trial was held on May 10, 2010. Family court filed its
 
Order Re: Trial on July 2, 2010. On July 12, 2010, Royale filed
 
a Motion for Reconsideration. On October 6, 2010, family court
 
issued its Order Re: Royale's Reconsideration Motion. On October
 
18, 2010, Ema filed a Motion for Reconsideration. On November 8,
 
2010, Ema filed her first notice of appeal. On November 9, 2010,
 
Royale filed his first notice of cross-appeal. On November 22,
 
2010, family court issued its Order Denying Ema's Reconsideration
 
Motion.
 
Family court issued the Divorce Decree on November 23,
 
2010. Ema filed her second notice of appeal on December 20, 2010
 
and Royale filed his first amended notice of cross-appeal on
 
December 22, 2010. On April 18, 2011, family court issued its
 
"Supplemental Record on Appeal [Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 
of Law]" (FOFs/COLs).
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Abuse of Discretion
 
When reviewing family court decisions for an abuse of
 
discretion, the Hawaif i Supreme Court has held: 
The family court possesses wide discretion in making
its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside
 
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Under the
 abuse of discretion standard of review, the family court's
decision will not be disturbed unless the family court
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.

quotation marks, citations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). 
B. Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal
under the "clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2)
despite substantial evidence in support of the
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with
a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
 made. "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court's COLs are
reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong
standard. COLs, consequently, are "not binding upon
an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their
correctness."
 
.  .  .  .
 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway
in its examination of the reports concerning a child's
care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in
this regard, if supported by the record and not
clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal.

Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawaif i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). 
C. Motion for Reconsideration
 
The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to
allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments
that could not have been presented during the earlier
adjudicated motion. Reconsideration is not a device to
 relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence
that could and should have been brought during the earlier
proceeding. We review a trial court's ruling on a motion
for reconsideration under the abuse of discretion standard. 
An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.

D.	 Credibility of Witnesses
 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not 
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and 
the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of 
fact." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawaif i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 
(2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
E.	 Property Division
 
There is no fixed rule for determining the amount of
property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce action other
than as set forth in [Hawaif i Revised Statutes] HRS
ยง 580-47. We have said that the discretionary power of a trialcourt in dividing and distributing property in a matrimonialaction under HRS ยง 580-47 will not be disturbed in the absence ofa showing of abuse. Further, the division and distribution ofproperty pursuant to a divorce need not be equal but should bejust and equitable. 
Teller v. Teller, 99 Hawaif i 101, 107, 53 P.3d 240, 246 (2002) 
(citations and footnote omitted) (quoting Au-Hoy v. Au-Hoy, 60 
Haw. 354, 357, 590 P.2d 80, 83 (1979)). 
An appellate court will not reverse the decision of a
 
family court judge on property division issues unless there has
 
been a manifest abuse of the judge's wide discretion. Ahlo v.
 
Ahlo, 1 Haw. App. 324, 329, 619 P.2d 112, 117 (1980). Discretion
 is abused when the lower court clearly exceeds the bounds of
 
reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to
 
the substantial detriment of a party litigant. State v. Sacoco,
 
45 Haw. 288, 292, 367 P.2d 11, 13 (1961).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 Family court has jurisdiction over the division of
an ownership interest in the Mokauea Property.
 
Ema contends Royale failed to provide evidence to
 
support his assertion that his parents, rather than he, owned the
 
Mokauea Property. Furthermore, Ema argues Royale is equitably
 
estopped from denying an ownership interest in the property when
 
his statements and actions during marriage indicated an ownership
 
interest.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On cross-appeal, Royale asserts family court abused its 
discretion in exercising jurisdiction over the Mokauea Property. 
He argues that title to the property is held by his parents,
 
Dorothy, as trustee of the Dorothy M. Komomua Trust, and Glenn,
 
as trustee of the Glenn A. Komomua Sr. Trust, pursuant to two
 
unrecorded trusts. Based on this assertion, Royale argues that
 
the Mokauea Property was not part of the marital property and
 
family court had no jurisdiction to affect the ownership interest
 
of Royale's parents to the property when they were not parties to
 
the divorce action.
 
Royale also argues he is not estopped from denying the
 
parties' ownership interest in the Mokauea Property. He contends
 
that Ema never believed she was an owner of the property and
 
therefore did not erroneously rely on that belief to her
 
detriment.
 
After trial, family court, "having given due
 
consideration to the reliable and credible testimony of the
 
parties and witnesses," found the parties had an ownership
 
interest in the Mokauea Property and concluded that "[a]ll of the
 
parties' interests in the Mokauea Property, be it legal or
 
equitable, are part of the marital estate." Family court
 
determined that "[Royale's] current claim of no ownership in the
 
Mokauea Property is contrary to his statements and actions during
 
the marriage. [Royale's] current claim of no ownership in the
 
Mokauea Property is not credible, and is not supported by
 
documents or exhibits."
 
Family court further found the testimony of tax expert
 
witness, Michael McEnerney (McEnerney), to be unrebutted,
 
credible, and reliable. McEnerney testified that a review of
 
Royale's and Ema's IRS income tax returns showed that Royale
 
behaved as if he had an ownership interest in the Mokauea
 
Property when he reported Schedule E rental income, deducted
 
depreciation, and deducted Schedule A real estate tax.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, family court noted Glenn failed to produce
 
documents substantiating the ownership of the Mokauea Property
 
and did not testify that Royale did not have an ownership
 
interest in the property.
 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not 
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and 
the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of 
fact." Fisher, 111 Hawaif i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
Because family court found Royale had an ownership
 
interest in the Mokauea Property, family court did not err in
 
exerting jurisdiction over the property. 
B.	 Family court did not err when it found there was
insufficient evidence to determine the value of
 the parties' interest in the Mokauea Property.
 
Ema contends family court erred in not finding that
 
Royale and Ema had a 100% ownership interest in the Mokauea
 
Property.
 
On appeal, Ema contends FOF 66 is in error and COLs 6
 
and 37 are wrong.
 
Findings of Fact
 
. . . . 
66. There was insufficient evidence for the Court to
 
determine the precise value of the partiesโ interest in the
Mokauea Property.
 
. . . .
 
Conclusions of Law
 
. . . .
 
6. There was the unrebutted expertโs opinion rendered
by [Ema's] expert Michael McEnerney M.B.A., J.D.,
C.P.A./A.B.V./C.F.F., A.S.A., C.V.A. Mr. McEneney testified
that based on [Royale's] answers to interrogatories and the
partiesโ joint income tax returns, the parties have an
ownership interest in the Mokauea Property between 50% and
100%, and the Court so finds and concludes.
 
. . . .
 
37. There shall be no property equalization payment.
 . . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon granting a divorce, family court "may make any
 
further orders as shall appear just and equitable[.]" Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 580-47(a) (2006 Repl.). This includes
 
"dividing and distributing the estate of the parties, real,
 
personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate[.]" 
HRS ยง 580-47(a)(3). 
The Hawaif i Supreme Court has construed HRS ยง 580-47 to 
confer "wide discretion upon the family court." Baker v. 
Bielski, 124 Hawaif i 455, 459, 248 P.3d 221, 225 (App. 2011) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In the absence 
of a showing of abuse, we will not disturb family court's 
discretionary power to divide property under HRS ยง 580-47. 
Teller, 99 Hawaif i at 107, 53 P.3d at 246. 
When dividing property, family court considers the
 
following: "the respective merits of the parties, the relative
 
abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will
 
be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for
 
the benefit of the children of the parties, and all other
 
circumstances of the case." HRS ยง 580-47(a).
 
Here, family court awarded Royale the Mokauea Property,
 
subject to the $200,000 debt. Ema was awarded the net sales
 
proceeds from Kula Kolea, amounting to $221,546.29. In COL 21,
 
family court determined that
 
21. The facts and circumstances in this case present
valid and relevant considerations authorizing a deviation
from the Partnership Model including:
 
a. the disparity in the income and financialresources of the parties; 
b. the disparity in the earning capability of theparties; 
c. the difference in the condition of the partiesas left by the divorce; 
d. [Ema's] present need to have liquid assets (KulaKolea proceeds); 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
e.	 [Royale's] being in a better position to
maximize the value of the Mokauea Property;
 
f.	 the respective merits of the parties.
 
Family court then concluded that
 
22. Based on the totality of the circumstances in this
case, and the reliable and credible testimony presented at
trial, it is just and equitable that the Court exercises its
discretion to award the Mokauea Property to [Royale] subject
to the debt thereon, and the proceeds from the sale of Kula
Kolea to [Ema].
 
The division of property is discretionary with family
 
court. Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude Royale fails
 
to carry his burden of showing family court abused its discretion
 
when it awarded Royale the Mokauea Property and Ema the net
 
proceeds from Kula Kolea.
 
C.	 Family court did not err in not ordering a
property equalization payment to Ema.
 
Ema argues family court erred in not ordering a
 
property equalization payment to her when it awarded the Mokauea
 
Property to Royale subject to the property's debt. Ema claims it
 
would be just and equitable under HRS ยง 580-47 to pay her an
 
equalization amount based on the net market value of the Mokauea
 
Property.
 
Family court took into account the factors listed under
 
HRS ยง 580-47(a) when it determined not to award a property
 
equalization payment. Family court did not abuse its broad and
 
equitable discretion in distributing the parties' marital
 
property.
 
D.	 Family court erred in using the 2004 Guidelines to
calculate child support.
 
Ema contends family court erred when it used the 2004 
Guidelines instead of the 2010 Hawaif i Child Support Guidelines 
(2010 Guidelines) to calculate her child support obligations. She 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3 4
argues that FOF 83  is in error and COLs 23 and 25 are wrong.  We
agree.
 
On July 2, 2010, family court issued its Order Re:
 
Trial, requiring Ema to pay $670/month in child support based on
 
her income. In calculating Ema's income, family court failed to
 
include the spousal support she received from Royale.
 
On July 12, 2010, Royale filed a motion for
 
reconsideration, arguing that the 2004 Guidelines required Ema's
 
spousal support to be added to her income, thus increasing the
 
amount she owed in child support payments. Before family court
 
ruled on Royale's motion, the 2010 Guidelines went into effect on
 
August 29, 2010. See 2010 Guidelines,
 
http://www.courts.state.hi.us/docs/form/maui/2CE248.pdf at 37
 (last accessed May 11, 2010). 
3
 Family court's FOFs provide, in relevant part:
 
83. Based on [Ema's] income of $2,386 per month, her child
support obligation for the three Children is $1080.00 per month
based on the 2004 Child Support Guidelines.
4
 Family court's COLs provide, in relevant part:
 
23. Under Vorfeld v. Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App. 391, 804 P.2d 891
(1991), [Royale] shall pay [Ema] transitional alimony in the
amount of $1,200 starting the month after the divorce for a period
of 120 months. This is appropriate to equalize the standard of
living of the parties following the divorce. Pursuant to HRS
 Section 580-47, in determining alimony, [family court] considered
all of the factors, including: the financial resources of the
parties, the ability of [Ema] to meet her needs independently, the
duration of the marriage, the standard of living established
during the marriage, the usual occupation of the parties during
the marriage, the vocational skills and employability of [Ema],
the needs of the parties, the financial resources of [Royale] in
view of his own needs, the financial condition in which the
parties will be left after the divorce, and the probable duration
of [Ema's] need for alimony. [Family court] also considered the
disparity in earning capacities of the parties, and [Ema's]
providing substantial homemaking, career nurturing, and child
rearing services over many years.
 
. . . . 
25. [Ema] shall pay $1,080 per month in child support. This
is based on her salary plus $1,200 per month alimony and the 2004
Child Support Guidelines.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On October 6, 2010, family court issued its Order Re:
 
Royale's Reconsideration Motion. Family court recalculated Ema's
 
income to include her spousal support, increasing her child
 
support obligation from $670/month to $1,080/month. In Ema's
 
motion for reconsideration, filed October 18, 2010, Ema argued
 
that under the 2010 Guidelines, her child support obligation
 
should be $1,039/month, a decrease of $41/month.
 
Family court is required to use the most current
 
version of the child support guidelines to calculate the amount
 
of the support obligation. HRS ยง 576D-7(d) (2006 Repl.). Before
 
family court ruled on Royale's motion for reconsideration, the
 
2010 Guidelines took effect, superseding all prior guidelines and
 
amendments. Id. Therefore, family court erred when it issued its
 
Order Re: Royale's Reconsideration Motion on October 6, 2010,
 using the 2004 Guidelines rather than the 2010 guidelines.
 
Ema also contends family court erred in calculating her
 
responsibility for the children's private school tuition and
 
post-high school educational expenses. Inasmuch as these figures
 
were also calculated based on the 2004 Guidelines, family court
 
5
erred and COLs 26 and 27  are wrong.
F.	 Family court did not err when it awarded Ema 120
months of alimony.
 
Royale contends family court abused its discretion in
 
awarding Ema 120 months of alimony. He alleges FOFs 80 and 81
 
are in error and COL 23 is wrong.
 
5
 Family court's COLs provide, in relevant part:
 
26. As of the date of the Decree, [Ema] shall pay 35% of
[childโs] Kamehameha Schools education expenses. This is based on
 
Line 13 of the 2004 Child Support Guidelines Worksheet ([2004
Guidelines]).
 
27. As of the date of the Decree, [Ema] shall pay 35% of the
Childrenโs post-high school educational expenses limited to the
amount of 35% of the then (not now) current University of Hawaii
educational expenses. This is based on Line 13 of the 2004 [2004
Guidelines].
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Family court's FOFs/COLs provide, in relevant part:
 
Findings of Fact
 
. . . .
 
80. [Royale] has the ability to earn at least three
times the amount of income that [Ema] earns.
 
81. [Ema's] request for $1,200 per month pre-tax
alimony is reasonable and necessary. [Royale] has the
ability to pay her $1,200 per month, which will be tax
deductible to him.
 
. . . .
 
Conclusions of Law
 
. . . .
 
23. Under Vorfeld v. Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App. 391, 804
P.2d 891 (1991), [Royale] shall pay [Ema] transitional
alimony in the amount of $1,200 starting the month after the
divorce for a period of 120 months. This is appropriate to
equalize the standard of living of the parties following the
divorce. Pursuant to HRS Section 580-47, in determining
alimony, [family court] considered all of the factors,
including: the financial resources of the parties, the
ability of [Ema] to meet her needs independently, the
duration of the marriage, the standard of living established
during the marriage, the usual occupation of the parties
during the marriage, the vocational skills and employability
of [Ema], the needs of the parties, the financial resources
of [Royale] in view of his own needs, the financial
condition in which the parties will be left after the
divorce, and the probable duration of [Ema's] need for
alimony. [Family court] also considered the disparity in
earning capacities of the parties, and [Ema's] providing
substantial homemaking, career nurturing, and child rearing
services over many years.
 
. . . .
 
Royale and Ema each would have us revisit testimony and 
exhibits related to income, expenses, ability to earn in the 
future, savings, loans, and other issues related to financial 
management. Given family court's "wide discretion in making its 
decisions," Fisher, 111 Hawaif i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360, and 
considering that "it is axiomatic that reconciling conflicting testimony is beyond the scope of appellate review[,]" Onaka v. 
Onaka, 112 Hawaif i 374, 384, 146 P.3d 89, 99 (2006), we hold that 
family court did not err in awarding Ema 120 months of alimony.
