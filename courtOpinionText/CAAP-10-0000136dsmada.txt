IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
VALERIE J. BORDEAUX,
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant/Appellant, 
v.
 
EMMET RICE and EDNA RICE,
Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0280)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff/Counterclaim
 
Defendant/Appellant Valerie J. Bordeaux (Appellant Bordeaux), has
 asserted from the Honorable Glen S. Hara's October 14, 2010
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Order Dismissing Plaintiff's Complaint with Prejudice" (the 
October 14, 2010 dismissal order) and March 1, 2011 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Order Issued October 14, 2010 Dismissing Plaintiff's Complaint and Granting Judgment to Defendant" (the March 1, 2011 order denying Appellant Bordeaux's motion to set aside the October 14, 2010 dismissal order) because the circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in this case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees, which "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). The separate judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An 
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
Neither the October 14, 2010 dismissal order nor the
 
March 1, 2011 order denying Appellant Bordeaux's motion to set
 aside the October 14, 2010 dismissal order is a judgment, but,
 instead, these two orders are interlocutory orders. On March 3,
 2011, the appellate court clerk filed the record on appeal for
 Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000136, at which time the record on appeal
 did not contain a separate judgment that resolves all claims in
 this case. Absent a separate, appealable judgment, Appellant
 Bordeaux's appeal is premature and we lack appellate

jurisdiction. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 
CAAP-10-0000136 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 9, 2011.
