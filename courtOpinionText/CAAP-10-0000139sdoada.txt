STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CLIFFORD NUTT, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2P110-00143)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Clifford Nutt ("Nutt") appeals from
 
twelve separate judgments, each entitled Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order, filed on October 13, 2010, in the District
 Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division ("District
 Court").
1/
 
On January 22, 2010, Nutt was charged with twelve
 
counts of violating Maui County Code ("MCC") ยง 6.04.040(C) (dog
 causing a nuisance) on January 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, and
 31, 2009, February 2, 2009, March 23 and 24, 2009, and
 January 10, 2010. On October 13, 2010, the District Court found
 Nutt guilty of all twelve violations.
 
On appeal, Nutt contends that (1) the District Court
 
lacked jurisdiction because the charges against him were
 deficient for failing to state the essential elements that (a)
 his dog engaged in "continuous and/or incessant barking, baying,
 crying, howling, or any other noise which disturbed a person at

any time of day or night for ten consecutive minutes and/or
 
intermittently for twenty minutes," and (b) the barking did not
 result from either "a trespass or threatened trespass by a person
 or persons on private property on which the dog is situated" or
 "a person teasing or otherwise provoking the dog," and (2) there
 was insufficient evidence to find that he committed twelve
 violations of MCC ยง 6.04.040.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Nutt's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The charges against Nutt were not deficient for 
failing to state an essential element. See State v. Mita, 124 
Hawai'i 385, 386, 245 P.3d 458, 459 (2010) (holding that a 
charge, based on a similar ordinance, that alleged "animal nuisance" generally was sufficient because "the definition of animal nuisance in [the ordinance] [did] not create an additional essential element of the offense, and . . . [was] consistent with its commonly understood meaning"). 
(2) There was sufficient evidence to find that Nutt
 
violated MCC ยง 6.04.040 as charged. Nutt admitted owning two
 dogs. Nutt's neighbor testified that on each date charged,
 Nutt's dogs were barking continuously for several hours on Nutt's
 lanai and that this disturbed him. Nutt stated that when he was
 home he left his dogs on his lanai, and when he was away, he put
 them inside his house. Nutt also stated that when he let the
 dogs inside, the dogs stopped barking. 
Evidence was submitted that Nutt's dogs barked when on 
the lanai, and that Nutt left them on the lanai when he was home; the dogs stopped barking when let inside his home, and that Nutt left them inside the home when he was away; and the dogs barked continuously for several hours on the dates specified in the charges and were not brought inside to stop them from barking. "Matters of credibility and the weight of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn are for the fact finder." State v. 
Romano, 114 Hawai' i 1, 8, 155 P.3d 1102, 1109 (2007). Thus, 
there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that Nutt allowed his dogs to bark excessively, and that Nutt thereby caused a nuisance in violation of MCC ยง 6.04.040. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the twelve
 
separate judgments, each entitled Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
and/or Order, filed on October 13, 2010, in the District Court of
 the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, are affirmed.
