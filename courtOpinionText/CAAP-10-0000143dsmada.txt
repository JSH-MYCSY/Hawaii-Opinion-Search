NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
NO. CAAP-10-0000143
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERT GREENWELL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-298K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Robert Greenwell's
 
(Greenwell) appeal from the Honorable Ronald Ibarra's November 3,
 
2010 order granting Greenwell's motion for deferred acceptance of
 
his no contest (DANC) plea to resisting arrest in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 710-1026 (1993 & Supp. 2012)
 
because HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2012) does not authorize an appeal
 
from such an order.
 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai 'i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "In a circuit court criminal case, a defendant may 
appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, see HRS § 641-11 
(1993), from a certified interlocutory order, see HRS § 641-17 
(1993), or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to 
dismiss based on double jeopardy." State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai
'i 
309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001). The November 3, 2010 order NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
granting Greenwell's DANC plea does not belong to any of these
 
three categories of statutorily authorized appeals for a criminal
 
defendant. For example, although "[a]ny party aggrieved by the
 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to
 
the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, in the
 
manner and within the time provided by the rules of court" (HRS
 
§ 641-11), the supreme court has explained that,
 
[u]nder HRS § 641-11, the sentence of the court in a
criminal case is the judgment from which an appeal is
authorized. Because there is no conviction when the
 acceptance of a plea is deferred, . . . an order granting a
DANC plea such as the one issued here is not a conviction
nor is it a sentence. There having been no conviction and
sentence in this case, there can be no appeal under HRS
§ 641-11 from the . . . order granting Defendant's plea
deferral.
 
Kealaiki, 95 Hawai 'i at 312, 22 P.3d at 591 (citations, internal 
quotation marks, original brackets, and original ellipsis points 
omitted) (dismissing a defendant's appeal from an order granting 
a DANC plea for lack of appellate jurisdiction). Similarly in 
the instant case, HRS § 641-11 does not authorize Greenwell's 
appeal from the November 3, 2010 order granting Greenwell's DANC 
plea. 
Absent a statute authorizing an appeal from the
 
November 3, 2010 order granting Greenwell's DANC plea, we lack
 
jurisdiction over Greenwell's appeal in appellate court case
 
number CAAP-10-0000143. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we dismiss this appeal for 
lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, December 12, 2013.
