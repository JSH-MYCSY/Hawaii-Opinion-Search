APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Geoffrey Molfino (Molfino) appeals 
from a January 11, 2011 judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees 
Christopher J. Yuen (Yuen), in his capacity as Planning Director 
for the County of Hawai' i, and the County of Hawai' i (County) 
(collectively, Appellees), entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).

Molfino's Opening Brief fails to include a "concise 
statement of the points of error set forth in separately numbered 
paragraphs", as required by Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4), but appears to primarily contend that the 
Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment on his

negligence claim because Appellees had a duty to maintain
 
accurate, relevant, timely and complete subdivision records.2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Molfino's points of error as follows:
 
"It is well-established that, in order for a plaintiff 
to prevail on a negligence claim, the plaintiff is required to 
prove all four of the necessary elements of negligence: (1) 
duty; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages." 
Kaho'ohanohano v. Dep't of Human Servs., State of Haw., 117 
Hawai'i 262, 287 n.31, 178 P.3d 538, 563 n.31 (2008) (citation 
omitted). 
HRS § 662-2 (1993) provides: 
§662-2 Waiver and liability of State. The State
 
hereby waives its immunity for liability for the torts of
its employees and shall be liable in the same manner and to
the same extent as a private individual under like
circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to
judgment or for punitive damages.
 
"The basic principle of governmental tort liability in 
Hawai[']i now is that the State and its political subdivisions 
shall be held accountable for the torts of governmental employees 
in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual 
under like circumstances[.]" Cootey v. Sun Inv., Inc., 68 Haw. 
480, 483, 718 P.2d 1086, 1089 (1986) (citation, internal quotation marks, ellipses, and brackets omitted; block quote 
format altered). However, not all negligent acts of government 
employees result in governmental liability. Cootey, 68 Haw. at 
483-84, 718 P.2d at 1090. 
"A prerequisite to any negligence action is the
 
existence of a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff." 
2/
 To the extent that Molfino attempts to identify other points of
error, they appear to be derivative of the alleged duty to maintain accurate
subdivision records.

Cuba v. Fernandez, 71 Haw. 627, 631, 801 P.2d 1208, 1211 (1990). 
This element of negligence is "[a] duty, or obligation,
 
recognized by the law, requiring the [defendant] to conform to a
 
certain standard of conduct, for the protection of others against
 
unreasonable risks[.]" Knodle v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc., 69
 
Haw. 376, 383, 742 P.2d 377, 385 (1987) (citation omitted; block
 quote format altered). "Whether such a duty exists is a question
 
of law." Cuba, 71 Haw. at 631, 801 P.2d at 1211 (citation
 
omitted).
 
In determining whether there was a duty owed by the
 
County to Molfino, "our task is to balance the policy
 considerations supporting recovery by the injured party against
 
those favoring a limitation of the County's liability." Cootey,
 
68 Haw. at 484, 718 P.2d at 1090 (citations omitted). 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has further explained: 
In deciding whether a duty exists or not, we must determine
how far it is desirable and socially expedient to permit theloss distributing function of tort law to apply togovernmental agencies, without thereby unduly interferingwith the effective functioning of such agencies for theirown socially approved ends. Government entities are mandated by law to perform a variety of activities whichhave no counterpart in the voluntary activities of private persons. Our system of separate but equal branches ofgovernment demands restraint on the part of the courts fromreordering priorities and forcing reallocation of resourcesupon the other branches which make policy decisions in thisregard. 
Cootey, 68 Haw. at 485, 718 P.2d at 1090-91 (internal citations
 
and quotation marks omitted).
 
"Whether there is a duty of care owed by the government
 
tortfeasor to the injured party should be determined by an
 
analysis of legislative intent of the applicable statute or
 
ordinance." Cootey, 68 Haw. at 485, 718 P.2d at 1091.

and Procedure  provides:

 Molfino argued in the Circuit Court that Appellees have a duty to
maintain records based on Planning Department Rules of Practice and Procedure
(continued...)

§ 1-8.  For the first time on appeal, Molfino contends that various other
statutes impose a duty upon Appellees to maintain records.  We agree with
Appellees that an argument not raised in the lower court will be deemed to
have been waived on appeal.  State v. Moses, 102 Hawai# i 449, 456, 77 P.3d
940, 947 (2003) ("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at
trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule
applies in both criminal and civil cases.").
41-8Public Records.
All public records shall be available for inspection
by any person during established office hours unless
public inspection of such records is in violation of
any other state, federal, or county law; provided
that, except where such records are open under any
rule of court, the Corporation Counsel or Prosecuting
Attorney may determine which records may be withheld
from public inspection when such records pertain to
the preparation of the prosecution or defense of any
action or proceeding to which the County is or may be
a party, or when such records do not relate to a
matter in violation of law and are deemed necessary
for the protection of the character or reputation of
any person.
Copies of records printed or reproduced for persons
other than governmental agencies shall be given to any
person, provided that the fees or costs prescribed in
the Hawai[# ]i County Code are paid.
Rule § 1-8 does not expressly impose a duty upon the
Planning Department to maintain all records or keep them in any
particular condition.  Rule § 1-8 is similar to the Uniform
Information Practices Act (UIPA ), codified at HRS Chapter 92F,4
and the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. §
552.  
UIPA does not "impose[] an affirmative obligation upon
a government agency to maintain records[,]" but it "requires
agencies to provide access to those records that are actually
maintained."  Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu,
119 Hawai# i 90, 97, 194 P.3d 531, 538 (2008) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, FOIA "does not
obligate agencies to create or retain documents; it only

4/HRS § 92F-11(b) provides, in relevant part:  "[E]ach agency upon
request by any person shall make government records available for inspection
and copying during regular business hours[.]"NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
obligates them to provide access to those which it in fact has 
created and retained." State of Haw. Org. of Police Officers 
(SHOPO) v. Soc'y of Prof'l Journalists - Univ. of Haw. Chapter, 83 Hawai' i 378, 394, 927 P.2d 386, 402 (1996) [hereinafter SHOPO] 
(citation omitted; block quote format altered). "[P]ossession or control is a prerequisite to FOIA disclosure duties[.]" SHOPO, 
83 Hawai' i at 394, 927 P.2d at 402 (citation omitted; block quote 
format altered). 
Here, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in 
concluding that the Planning Department did not have a 
statutorily-based duty to maintain its records with unerring 
accuracy. In addition, Molfino has not cited any cases 
establishing a common law duty of this nature, either in Hawai' i 
or elsewhere, and we find none. 
"Government is not intended to be an insurer of all the
 
dangers of modern life, despite its ever-increasing effort to
 protect its citizens from peril." Cootey, 68 Haw. at 485, 718
 
P.2d at 1090 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Government is not "liable for all injuries sustained by private
 
persons as a result of governmental activity, even though doing
 
so would spread the losses over the largest possible base[.]" 
Cootey, 68 Haw. at 485, 718 P.2d at 1090 (citation omitted).
 
"Without a reasonable and proper limitation of the
 
scope of duty of care owed by the County, the County would be
 
confronted with an unmanageable, unbearable, and totally
 
unpredictable liability." Cootey, 68 Haw. at 484, 718 P.2d at
 
1090. 
Strong policy considerations compel us to reject
 
Molfino's argument that Appellees owed a duty to maintain
 accurate and complete records for persons who seek information
 
regarding the degree to which real property may be capable of
 
subdivision.
