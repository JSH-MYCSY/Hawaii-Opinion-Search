Iese's two petitions, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40, address his convictions in two 
criminal cases. In case No. 1DTA-06-04109, Iese pled no contest 
and was convicted of Operating a Vehicle under the Influence of 
an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) & (a)(3) (Supp. 2011). Judgment in Case 
No. 1DTA-06-04109 was entered on July 11, 2006. 
In case No. 1DTA-06-04489, Iese pled no contest and was
 
convicted of OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) & (a)(4)
 
(Supp. 2011). Judgment in case No. 1DTA-06-04489 was entered on
 
October 11, 2006.
 
On August 9, 2010, approximately four years after the 
judgments in case No. 1DTA-06-04109 and case No. 1DTA-06-04489 
were entered, Iese filed the two Petitions to Vacate or Set Aside 
Conviction and to Correct Judgment (Petitions), pursuant to HRPP 
Rule 40, challenging his convictions in case No. 1DTA-06-04109 
and case No. 1DTA-06-04489. Citing to State v. Wheeler, 121 
Hawai'i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), Iese claimed that the oral 
charges in these cases were deficient for failing to allege that the offense occurred "upon a public way, street, road or 
highway." Iese claimed that the district court lacked 
jurisdiction in the criminal proceedings because the charges were 
deficient. 
On appeal, Iese raises the following points of error:
 
(1) the district court abused its discretion by not considering
 
and/or applying non-mutual offensive issue preclusion; (2) the
 
district court erred in holding that the criminal charges did not
 
result in a lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and (3) the
 
district court erred in holding that the State's failure to
 
allege a material element of the offense did not result in a
 
fatally defective charge under the Motta/Wells analysis.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Iese's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The district court did not issue any findings of 
fact and conclusions of law relating to Iese's claim that non-
mutual offensive issue preclusion should apply. HRPP Rule 
40(g)(3) ("The court shall state its findings of fact and 
conclusions of law in entering its judgment on the petition."). 
However, it was harmless error because even assuming arguendo 
that the doctrine of non-mutual offensive issue preclusion may 
apply in criminal cases, the requirements for that doctrine are 
not satisfied. Domingo v. State, 76 Hawai' i 237, 243, 873 P.2d 
775, 781 (1994) (applying harmless error analysis to trial court's failure to state appropriate findings of fact and 
conclusions of law in a judgment on a Rule 40 petition). 
In order for non-mutual offensive issue preclusion to 
apply, the four-part test set forth in Dorrance v. Lee, 90 
Hawai'i 143, 149, 976 P.2d 904, 910 (1999) must be satisfied, 
among other things. Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont De 
Nemours & Co., 104 Hawai' i 358, 373, 90 P.3d 250, 265 (2004). 
The four requirements under Dorrance are: 
(1) the issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical
to the one presented in the action in question; (2) there is
a final judgment on the merits; (3) the issue decided in the
prior adjudication was essential to the final judgment; and
(4) the party against whom [issue preclusion] is asserted
was a party or in privity with a party to the prior
adjudication[.]
 
90 Hawai' i at 149, 976 P.2d at 910. 
Iese contends that non-mutual offensive issue
 
preclusion applies because in other OVUII cases before the
 
district court, where a motion to dismiss for lack of subject
 
matter jurisdiction had been filed, charges had been dismissed
 
because they failed to allege that the offenses had occurred on a
 
public way, street, road, or highway. However, the issue decided
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the other cases was not identical to the one presented to the
 
district court in addressing Iese's HRPP Rule 40 Petitions. 
Here, Iese had already pleaded no contest to the charges in both
 
of the underlying criminal cases and had not objected to the
 
charges at any time during the pendency of those cases. In the
 
prior district court cases that Iese relies upon, the defendant
 
had objected to the charge prior to conviction and the cases were
 
dismissed.
 
Moreover, in the prior district court cases that Iese
 
relies upon, there was not a "final judgment on the merits,"
 
which is also required under Dorrance.
 Thus, the lack of findings of fact and conclusions of
 
law by the district court regarding Iese's claim that non-mutual
 
offensive issue preclusion applied was harmless.
 
(2) Iese argues that because the OVUII charges in both
 
of his criminal cases failed to allege that the offenses occurred
 
on a public way, street, road, or highway, they were fatally
 
deficient thereby depriving the district court of jurisdiction.
 
Iese relies on State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 63 P.3d 1109 
(2003). However, in Wheeler, the Hawai' i Supreme Court stated: 
this court has applied different principles depending on
whether or not an objection was timely raised in the trial
court. Under the "Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal
construction rule," we liberally construe charges challenged
for the first time on appeal. See Merino, 81 Hawai' i at 212, 
915 P.2d at 686; Wells, 78 Hawai' i at 381, 894 P.2d at 78; 
Elliott, 77 Hawai' i at 311, 884 P.2d at 374; State v. Motta,
66 Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019, 1019-20 (1983). Under thisapproach, there is a "presumption of validity," Sprattling,
99 Hawai' i at 318, 55 P.3d at 282, for charges challenged
subsequent to a conviction. In those circumstances, thiscourt will "not reverse a conviction based upon a defectiveindictment [or complaint] unless the defendant can showprejudice or that the indictment [or complaint] cannot
within reason be construed to charge a crime." Merino, 81
Hawai'i at 212, 915 P.2d at 686 (citation omitted). 
121 Hawai' i at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87 (emphasis added). 
Here, Iese's first objection to the charges was raised in his 
HRPP Rule 40 Petitions, which were filed approximately four years 
after his no contest pleas and convictions in the underlying 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
criminal cases. Given the Hawai' i Supreme Court's opinion in 
Wheeler noting the importance as to whether a defendant timely 
raises an objection to the charge, the rationale for the 
Motta/Wells rule is equally applicable to the instant 
circumstances. The district court thus properly applied the 
Motta/Wells analysis. 
(3) Under the Motta/Wells analysis, as set forth in 
Wheeler, Iese must show prejudice or that the charge cannot 
within reason be construed to charge a crime. 121 Hawai' i at 
399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87. Iese's arguments seeking to construe the Motta/Wells analysis in a different fashion are at 
odds with the opinion in Wheeler as to the applicable analysis 
when there is an untimely challenge to a charge. 
Moreover, all information Iese possessed up to the 
district court's ruling on his challenge to the charge may be 
reviewed to determine if he was adequately informed of the 
charges against him. See State v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai' i 369, 
379, 235 P.3d 365, 375 (2010). 
In his Rule 40 Petitions and in his arguments on
 
appeal, Iese did not attempt to show that he was prejudiced by
 the charges and thus he has waived any challenge on this basis. 
Moreover, the record establishes that Iese cannot show that he
 
was prejudiced or that the charge cannot within reason be
 
construed to charge a crime. Based on the stipulation of the
 
parties, the district court made the following findings of facts
 
which are thus unchallenged on appeal:
 
The following findings of fact numbered 1 through 4 were
stipulated by the parties:
 
1.	 Prior to November 17, 2009, Petitioner, who was
represented by counsel, was orally charged or
charged by way of written complaint and pled no
contest or guilty to one or more charges of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant (DUI) in violation of Section 291E­61, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS).
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2.	 The oral or written charge did not include an
allegation that Petitioner committed the offense
on a public way, street, road or highway.
 
3.	 Petitioner did not contest or otherwise
 challenge the charge as defective at the time of
arraignment and plea or any other time until the
filing of the instant petition filed pursuant to
Rule 40, HRPP.
 
4.	 After Petitioner was arraigned, he completed the
standard change of plea form affirming that he
had been advised of and understood the nature
 and elements of the charges.
 
(Emphasis added.) By admitting that he was advised and
 
understood the nature and elements of the charges, Iese cannot
 
claim that he was not provided notice of all of the essential
 
elements of the OVUII charges or that the charges cannot within
 
reason be construed to charge a crime.
 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law and Order Denying HRPP Rule 40 Petitions to
 Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment, filed on October 12, 2010
 
in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, in
 
Civil No. 1SD10-1-14 and Civil No. 1SD10-1-15, is affirmed.
