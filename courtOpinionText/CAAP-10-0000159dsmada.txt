NO. CAAP-10-0000159
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS OF THE PALM VILLAS
 AT MAUNA LANI RESORT, by its Board of Directors,
Applicant-Appellee,
 
 
v.
 
SUNSTONE ML, LLC,
Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 10-1-015K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Respondent-Appellant Sunstone ML LLC's
 
(Appellant), appeal from the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's
 October 25, 2010 "Order Granting Applicant Association of
 Apartment Owners of the Palm Villas at Mauna Lani Resort, by its
 Board of Directors' Motion to Compel Mediation and Arbitration
 Filed on May 21, 2010" (the October 25, 2010 order compelling
 arbitration) because, under the circumstances of this special
 proceeding, the October 25, 2010 order compelling arbitration is
 not yet eligible for appellate review, and Appellant's appeal is
 premature.
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-28(a)(1) (Supp.
 
2010) authorizes an appeal from an order denying a motion to
 
compel arbitration:
 
§ 658A-28. Appeals.
 
(a) An appeal may be taken from: 
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration; 
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration; 
(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an
 
award; 
(4) An order modifying or correcting an award; 
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or 
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter. 
(b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as from an
order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
HRS § 658A-28 (emphasis added). However, HRS § 658A-28(a) does
 
not authorize an appeal from an order granting a motion to compel
 arbitration. Therefore, the October 25, 2010 order compelling
 arbitration is not appealable pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a).
 
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010) authorizes appeals 
to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgment, orders, or decrees. However, appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i holds that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 
120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). The circuit court has not yet entered a final separate judgment in this case.

Therefore, the October 25, 2010 order compelling arbitration is
 
not eligible for appellate review under HRS § 641-1(a).
 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)(the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the October 25, 2010 order compelling arbitration does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine) and Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). We note in particular that, under the collateral order doctrine, "[a]n order granting a motion to compel arbitration is final and appealable" under circumstances when such an order "is one of that small category of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated." Sher v. Cella, 114 Hawai' i 263, 266-67, 
160 P.3d 1250, 1253-54 (App. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). In Sher v. Cella, the parties were litigating a "complaint [that] contained six counts: (1) misrepresentation and non-disclosure, (2) breach of contract,
 (3) breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, (4) negligence,
 (5) deceptive trade practices, and (6) unjust enrichment." Id. at
 
266, 160 P.3d at 1253. Thus, when the circuit court entered an
 order granting a motion to compel arbitration of these causes of
 action, we held that, under the collateral order doctrine, the
 "order granting [the] motion to compel arbitration is final and
 appealable[.]" Id. at 266-67, 160 P.3d at 1253. However, in
 
contrast to the collateral order compelling arbitration in Sher v.
 Cella, the October 25, 2010 order compelling arbitration in the
 instant case is not separable from, and collateral to, the merits
 of the claim for relief that Applicant-Appellee AOAO Palm Villas
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at Mauna Lani Resort sought in initiating the special civil
 
proceeding in S.P. No 10-1-015K. The only claim for relief sought
 by Applicant-Appellee AOAO Palm Villas at Mauna Lani Resort in
 S.P. No. 10-1-015K is to compel mediation and arbitration. The
 October 25, 2010 order compelling arbitration relates directly to
 the merits of Applicant-Appellee AOAO Palm Villas at Mauna Lani
 Resort's May 21, 2010 motion to compel mediation and arbitration
 in S.P. No 10-1-015K. Therefore, the October 25, 2010 order
 compelling arbitration does not satisfy the second requirement for
 the collateral order doctrine, namely that the order must resolve
 an important issue completely separate from, and collateral to,
 the merits of the action. Accordingly, under the circumstances of
 the instant case, the October 25, 2010 order compelling
 arbitration is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
 
Finally, the circuit court has not certified the October
 
25, 2010 order compelling arbitration for an interlocutory appeal
 pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2010). Therefore, the
 October 25, 2010 order compelling arbitration is not appealable
 pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b).
 
Under the circumstances of the special civil proceeding
 
in S.P. No 10-1-015K, the October 25, 2010 order compelling
 arbitration is not appealable until the circuit court enters a
 separate judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 58. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP­
10-0000159 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
