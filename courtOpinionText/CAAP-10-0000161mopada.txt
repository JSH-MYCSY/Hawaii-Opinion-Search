APPEAL FROM THE COMMISSION ON WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
  
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Nâ Moku � Aupuni �o Ko�olau Hui (Nâ 
Moku) appeals from the Commission on Water Resource Management's 
(Commission) October 18, 2010 decision denying Nâ Moku's Petition 
for a Contested Case Hearing on the Commission's amendment of 
interim instream flow standards (IIFS) for certain East Maui 
streams. 
I.
 
On May 24, 2001, Nâ Moku (a nonprofit corporation
 
1
organized by native Hawaiian residents of East Maui ahupua� a) ,
Beatrice Kekahuna, Marjorie Wallet, and Elizabeth Lehua Lapenia

 In Hawaiian, ahupua� a means a "[l] and division usually extending
from the uplands to the sea[.]" Mary Kawena Pukui & Samuel H. Elbert,

filed petitions to amend the IIFS for twenty-seven East Maui
 
streams. On May 25, 2010, the Commission held an open meeting to
 
reach a decision on IIFS amendment for nineteen of the streams.2
 
The Commission restored flow to six streams (two on an annual
 basis and four on a seasonal basis) and decided that the IIFS for
 
the remaining thirteen streams would remain unamended. Before
 
the end of the May 25, 2010 Commission meeting, Nâ Moku's counsel
 
orally requested a contested case hearing to challenge the
 
decision, and on June 4, 2010, Nâ Moku filed a written Petition
 
for a Contested Case Hearing Before the Commission on Water
 
Resource Management (Petition for Hearing) pursuant to the
 
Commission's administrative rules.

On October 18, 2010, the Commission met to consider Nâ
 
Moku's Petition. The Commission's Acting Deputy Director filed a
 
"Staff Submittal" recommending that the Commission deny Nâ Moku's
 
June 4, 2010 Petition for Hearing. The October 18, 2010 meeting
 
minutes state that a quorum of five commissioners attended the
 
meeting and that the five commissioners unanimously voted to
 
approve the Acting Deputy Director's "Staff Submittal"
 
recommending denial of the Petition for Hearing. On November 17,
 
2010, Nâ Moku filed a timely notice of appeal from the

 On September 25, 2008, the Commission amended the flow standards
for eight of the twenty-seven streams; these amendments are not part of this
appeal.

 Hawaii Administrative Rule § 13-167-52(a) states:
 
§13-167-52 Request for hearing. (a) A hearing on a
contested matter may be requested by the commission on its
own motion or upon the written petition of any government
agency or interested person. An oral or written request for
a contested case hearing must be made by the close of the
public hearing (if one is required) or the commission
meeting at which the matter is scheduled for disposition (if
no public hearing is required). In either situation, the
person or agency requesting the contested case hearing must
file (or mail and postmark) a written petition with the
commission not later than ten days after the close of the
public hearing or the commission meeting, whichever is
applicable.

Commission's decision at the October 18, 2010 meeting.
 
On appeal, Nâ Moku contends the Commission erred in:
 
(1) concluding that Nâ Moku had no right to a contested
 
case hearing; and
 
(2) reaching its underlying decision regarding IIFS
 
amendment for the nineteen streams at issue. Specifically, Nâ
 Moku contends the Commission failed to allocate the proper legal
 
burden of proof and breached its public trust duties.
 
II.
 
In reviewing a denial of a request for a contested case
 
hearing, the appropriate inquiry is whether the appellant has met
 
the requirements of HRS § 91-14 (1993). Kaleikini v. Thielen,
 
124 Hawai� i 1, 16, 237 P.3d 1067, 1082 (2010). The requirements 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14 are as follows: 
first, the proceeding that resulted in the unfavorable
agency action must have been a "contested case"
hearing—i.e., a hearing that was 1) "required by law" and 2)
determined the "rights, duties, and privileges of specific
parties"; second, the agency's action must represent "a
final decision and order,"or "a preliminary ruling" such
that deferral of review would deprive the claimant of
adequate relief; third, the claimant must have followed the
applicable agency rules and, therefore, have been involved
"in" the contested case; and finally, the claimant's legal
interests must have been injured—i.e., the claimant must
have standing to appeal.

79 Hawai� i 425, 431, 903 P.2d 1246, 1252 (1995) (emphases added). 
Nâ Moku, in requesting a contested case hearing,
 
clearly met the last three requirements of HRS § 91-14. The
 
October 18, 2010 meeting minutes represented a "final decision
 
and order" for which judicial review was sought pursuant to
 
HRS § 91-14(a).4 Nâ Moku complied with the applicable agency
 
rules in requesting a contested case hearing and sufficiently

demonstrated standing to participate in a contested case. An 
association may be an aggrieved person with standing to challenge 
an agency's action if it can show that some of its members are 
"specially, personally and adversely affected by the agency's 
action." Life of the Land v. Land Use Comm'n, 61 Haw. 3, 8, 594 
P.2d 1079, 1082 (1979). Nâ Moku demonstrated through unrefuted testimony that its members were native Hawaiians with traditional 
and customary rights, appurtenant water rights, and/or riparian 
rights to waters from the streams for, among other things, the 
cultivation of taro. Article XII, § 7 of the Hawai� i 
Constitution protects such rights, and Nâ Moku's members demonstrated injury because their ability to exercise these 
rights has been adversely affected by the streamflow within the 
ahupua�a. Therefore, Nâ Moku had an interest in a proceeding 
setting the IIFS for those streams. 
Consequently, the remaining issue in this appeal 
concerns the first requirement of HRS § 91-14. The appellees contend there is no legal requirement to hold a contested case 
hearing on the IIFS amendments. "[P]ursuant to HRS S 91-14, in 
order for proceedings before an agency to constitute a contested 
case from which an appeal can be maintained, the agency must be 
required by law to hold a hearing before a decision is rendered." 
Lingle v. Hawai� i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, 107 
Hawai�i 178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 (2005). 
An agency hearing can be "required by law" pursuant to 
statute, agency rule, or constitutional due process. Kaleikini, 
124 Hawai� i at 17, 237 P.2d at 1083. Neither statute nor 
administrative rule mandates a hearing to establish an IIFS. However, in In re � Iao Ground Water Management Area High-Level 
Source Water Use Permit Applications, 2012 WL 3535294 (2012), a related case arising out of the setting of IIFS for streams in 
West Maui, the Hawai� i Supreme Court held that the Commission's 
decisions setting or amending the IIFS can affect 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
constitutionally protected property interests. Id. at *9-*11. 
In that case, the Commission had held a contested case hearing to
 
resolve both petitions to amend the IIFS and related water use
 
permit applications (WUPA) filed for the same area, and the
 
petitioners sought judicial review of the Commission's decision
 
and order setting the IIFS. Id. at *1. Although WUPA decisions
 
require hearings, the appellees in that case claimed the
 Commission's IIFS decisions had no impact on the petitioners'
 
property rights, and therefore there was no constitutional due
 
process right to a contested case hearing (and no right to
 
judicial review). Id. at *9, *40-*41. The supreme court
 
disagreed, holding that the petitioners had established a
 protected property interest and thus had a due process right to a
 
hearing on the Commission's IIFS determinations, independent of
 
the WUPA decision. Id. at *11.
 
The petitioners in that case testified that their
 
native Hawaiian members "live, work, and play" in the areas of
 
the streams at issue, and they claimed the Commission's decision
 
to restore a limited amount of water to the streams adversely
 
affected their native Hawaiian rights and their ability to engage
 
in traditional and customary gathering practices. Id. at *11­
*12. The supreme court observed that these interests have a
 statutory basis in the water code, supporting the petitioners'
 
entitlement to water for exercising traditional and customary
 
rights. Id. at *12. The supreme court cited HRS § 174C-101
 
(2011 Repl.), which states:
 
§174C-101 Native Hawaiian water rights.
 
. . . .
 
(c) Traditional and customary rights of ahupua� a 
tenants who are descendants of native Hawaiians who 
inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778 shall not beabridged or denied by this chapter. Such traditional and customary rights shall include, but not be limited to, thecultivation or propagation of taro on one's own kuleana andthe gathering if hihiwai, ôpae, o� opu, limu, thatch, ti

leaf, aho cord, and medicinal plants for subsistence,
cultural, and religious purposes.
 
(d) The appurtenant water rights of kuleana and taro
lands, along with those traditional and customary rights
assured in this section, shall not be diminished or
extinguished by a failure to apply for or to receive a
permit under this chapter.
 
The supreme court held the Commission's decision to 
retain the existing IIFS for two of the streams endorsed upstream 
diversions and determined the petitioners' individual water 
rights by affecting their access to water from those streams. In 
re �Iao at *13. Consequently, the supreme court concluded the 
petitioners had a right to a contested case hearing on the 
Commission's IIFS amendment. Id. 
In this case, Nâ Moku asserts comparable interests, 
entitling it to an administrative hearing on the petitions to 
amend the IIFS. The President of Nâ Moku, Edward Wendt (Wendt), 
stated that the organization's purposes include "promot[ing] the 
general welfare of the tenants and descendants of the original 
tenants of the ahupua� a of Keanae-Wailuanui [in East Maui] in 
social, spiritual, cultural, educational and economic affairs" and asserting its members' appurtenant and riparian water rights 
and their traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights. 
Wendt, a native Hawaiian resident and taro farmer in the ahupua� a 
of Wailuanui, testified that he and other Nâ Moku members engaged in native Hawaiian traditional and customary practices such as 
taro cultivation, and that their ability to engage in these 
practices has been affected by the streamflow within the 
ahupua�a. A cultural expert and community members who owned or 
resided on land in the area of the East Maui streams submitted testimony to the Commission about similar interests in gathering

hîhîwai, limu, o�opu, and ôpae  from the streams and in fishing 
along coastlines into which those streams discharge fresh water. 
Inasmuch as no contested case hearing was held but was 
required by law, the next issue is whether the hearing, had it 
been held, would have determined the "rights, duties, and 
privileges of specific parties." Kaleikini, 124 Hawai
�i at 24, 
237 P.3d at 1090. As in In re � Iao, we conclude the Commission's 
decision to retain the existing IIFS and maintain diversions for 
thirteen of the streams determined individual water rights by 
limiting Nâ Moku's members' access to water. 
Consequently, pursuant to In re � Iao, Nâ Moku is 
entitled to a contested case hearing with the full procedural 
protections afforded by the Hawai� i Administrative Procedures Act 
(HAPA). "The adjudicatory procedures of [HAPA] apply to hearings which an agency is constitutionally required to provide." Bush 
v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai� i 128, 131, 870 P.2d 1272, 
1275 (1994). The May 25, 2010 meeting, at which the Commission 
reached an IIFS determination for the nineteen streams, did not 
comply with the adjudicatory procedures of HAPA. Among other 
things, the Commission did not produce a written decision 
accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law. See, HRS 
§§ 91-9 to 91-13 (1993). We consequently decline Nâ Moku's invitation to address the merits of whether the Commission erred

in reaching its determination on the petitions to amend the IIFS
 
for the nineteen streams, as argued in the parties' briefs. This
 
matter is to be properly presented, argued, and decided pursuant
