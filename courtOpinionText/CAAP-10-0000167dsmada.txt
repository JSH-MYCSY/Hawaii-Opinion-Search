Court’s (circuit court)  November 8, 2010, "Order Denying
Motions: #1 Objection by Petitioner on Order Denying Plaintiff's
 
Motion Lawsuit Sentencing Judgment Denied Petitioner's Privileges
 for His Back Surgery Offense Against Public Justice and Officials
 Filed August 12, 2010, Filed October 4, 2010; #2 Motion to
 Appoint Legal Counsel, Court Appointed Attorney Filed October 20,
 2010" (the November 8, 2010 interlocutory order), because the
 November 8, 2010 interlocutory order is not independently
 appealable, and the circuit court has not yet entered a final
 judgment in this case.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. 
Appeals under HRS 
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has promulgated Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. The separate judgment must 
"either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)."

Id. "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment 
in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in 
the supreme court will be dismissed." Id.
 at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339 (footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 
Hawai'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; 
emphasis added). 
The November 8, 2010 interlocutory order is not a 
judgment. On October 17, 2011 the record on appeal for Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000167 was filed, at which time the record on appeal did not contain a separate judgment that resolved all claims, as HRCP Rule 58 requires for an appeal under the holding in Jenkins. Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b), the November 8, 2010 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000167.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State Appellees'
