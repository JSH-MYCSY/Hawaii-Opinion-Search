Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2012)  and Simple
Trespass, a violation of HRS § 708-815 (1993).3
 
DeMello's points on appeal are that (1) there was
 
insufficient evidence to convict him of Harassment, (2) his
 
sentence was illegal because the District Court imposed the
 
maximum 30-day term of incarceration and ordered him to attend
 
anger management classes for his Harassment conviction, (3) the
 
District Court abused its discretion by ordering him to pay
 
restitution because (a) the District Court failed to apportion
 
restitution for the victim's medical expenses based on the
 
victim's pre-existing medical condition and because it was not
 
clear that DeMello was the sole cause of the victim's injuries,
 
(b) restitution for lost wages is not permitted by HRS § 706-646,
 
and (c) the evidence in the record did not support the amount of
 
restitution DeMello was ordered to pay, and (4) the District
 
Court failed to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law
 
regarding the manner of restitution payment and the amount that
 
DeMello could reasonably afford to pay.
 
I. Background
 
On July 5, 2008, DeMello was charged with Harassment of
 
Carleen Kelekoma (Carleen) and Simple Trespass upon the premises
 
owned by Carleen. DeMello's one-day, non-jury trial was held on
 
December 14, 2009.
 
Alex Kelekoma (Alex), testified that he was married to
 
Carleen and lived with his two children, a son, from a previous
 
marriage to Cherilyn Kelekoma (Cherilyn) and a daughter with
 
Carleen. At the time of the events in this case, DeMello was
 
Cherilyn's boyfriend and son's football coach. Alex was the
 
equipment manager for the same team.
 
2
 HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) provides: "A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that
person: Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another person in an
offensive manner or subjects the other person to offensive physical
contact[.]" (formatting changed).

 DeMello does not challenge his Simple Trespass violation on
appeal.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Alex and Cherilyn had agreed that, after school on
 
certain days, son would catch the bus from school to the Kelekoma
 
home. On May 9, 2008, son failed to get off the bus at his
 
regular time; Alex became worried and called Cherilyn. Cherilyn
 
informed Alex that DeMello had picked son up from school.
 
The next day, Alex told Carleen about the incident. 
Later that evening, Alex called DeMello and told him that he did
 
not appreciate what happened and that he should have been
 
informed that DeMello would pick son up. DeMello said, "Oh yeah,
 
I went and picked him up from school because we didn't trust him
 
going to your house because your wife took away the cell phone." 
Both Alex and DeMello were calm; neither raised their voice.
 
Carleen took the phone from Alex and also spoke to
 
DeMello because she believed that DeMello was overstepping his
 
boundaries. According to Alex, Carleen was not "yelling or
 
making derogatory comments or anything," but from a two-to-three­
foot distance, Alex could hear DeMello yelling, although he could
 
not hear what was being said. Carleen told DeMello, "Calm down,
 
brother, calm down." Carleen told Alex that DeMello hung up on
 
her.
 
About a minute later, Cherilyn called Alex's phone and
 
Carleen answered it. Carleen told Cherilyn, "I didn't do
 
anything to him." Five to ten minutes later, Alex saw DeMello
 
pacing back and forth in front of Alex's yard, next to the fence. 
Alex waived DeMello over; DeMello jumped over the fence instead
 
of using the gate. DeMello came up "pretty fast" and "had a
 
really angry posture[.]" Alex testified that DeMello immediately
 
went up to Carleen with his hand raised, as if he were
 
threatening to hit her, saying, "you don't know who you are
 
messing with, don't talk to me like that[.]" DeMello was toe-to­
toe with Carleen. Carleen took a step back and was shocked. 
Alex stood between them and told DeMello to calm down. Carleen
 
asked DeMello, "What? You going to hit me L.D.?" DeMello
 
responded, "I not going to hit you, but you better watch who you
 
3
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are talking to." Nevertheless, DeMello still had "his backhand
 
raised." Carleen told DeMello to leave.
 
Carleen continued to converse with DeMello, and
 
Cherilyn arrived about five minutes after DeMello did. Cherilyn
 
also appeared angry and immediately approached Carleen, saying,
 
"What's your problem, you know? What did you do?" The
 
conversation then became more heated. Carleen was backing up and
 
Cherilyn was gradually getting closer as the argument progressed,
 
until "she finally went for Carleen." Alex immediately got
 
between the women and, facing Carleen, pinned her back against
 
their clothesline. As Cherilyn tried to go over Alex's shoulder
 
towards Carleen, Alex picked Carleen up and started walking off
 
the patio towards the yard. Cherilyn came over Alex's back,
 
causing all three to fall across the lawn. Alex then saw
 
DeMello, using both hands, grab Carleen's hair on either side of
 
her head and drag her across the lawn about 10 feet, with enough
 
force to lift her legs off the ground. Alex immediately got up
 
and shoved DeMello away. DeMello started yelling at Alex,
 
telling him, "Don't put your hands on me. You know, like I will
 
knock you out." Alex told DeMello, "Brother, I am just
 
protecting my wife." When DeMello continued to threaten Alex,
 
Alex told DeMello, "You know what, Brother, you guys got to go. 
Leave already." However, DeMello and Cherilyn did not leave and
 
DeMello "was bouncing around like with his hands up, you know,
 
like he wanted to fight."
 
Carleen testified that after she fell on the lawn with
 
Alex and Cherilyn, she "felt excruciating pain on both
 
sides . . . left and right, like my hair was [being] pulled" and
 
then "felt [her] neck crunch back and [] heard it crack and then
 
black." After she awoke, Carleen saw that she was ten feet
 
away, under her lemon tree, felt excruciating pain on her head
 
and neck, had a hard time breathing, and was dizzy. She then
 
told DeMello and Cherilyn to get off her property but they did
 
not immediately leave. When Carleen repeated that DeMello and
 
Cherilyn should go, Cherilyn responded, "I can't stop him, you
 
4
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
can't stop him, nobody can, so get out of the way or you are
 
going to get hurt." At that point, Carleen went into the house
 
to call the police. Aggravated, Cherilyn said, "You know what,
 
call the cops. I will take your asses to court and I'll take my
 
son away and you know they will give him to me because I am the
 
mother."
 
About five minutes after they were called, the police
 
arrived; DeMello was still engaged in yelling at the Kelekomas
 
and did not notice their arrival until one of the officers tapped
 
him on his shoulder. DeMello left the property without being
 
arrested but was later served a summons and complaint for
 
Harassment and Simple Trespass.
 
Cherilyn and DeMello described the incident somewhat
 
differently. Cherilyn claimed that Carleen attacked her first 
and attacked her again after Alex intervened. It was DeMello
 
that told Carleen to let go of Cherilyn's hair. After Cherilyn,
 
Carleen, and Alex fell on the ground Cherilyn believed that
 
DeMello grabbed Carleen's hair to make her let go of her own hair
 
but did not actually see DeMello grab Carleen's hair. In
 
response to Alex's inquiry as to why DeMello did that to Carleen,
 
DeMello stated that he was defending Cherilyn. Cherilyn denied
 
that Carleen or Alex asked her or DeMello to leave the premises.
 
DeMello testified that Alex invited him onto the
 
property so he jumped over the fence as he had done on previous
 
occasions. DeMello claimed that Carleen came up to him
 
aggressively and invaded his "comfort zone" so he put up both of
 
his hands. He explained that he tried to calm Carleen down. 
Carleen calmed down but then began to argue with Cherilyn after
 
she arrived. Alex was holding Carleen back and he was holding
 
Cherilyn back when Carleen reached over and grabbed Cherilyn's
 
hair. According to DeMello, only Carleen and Cherilyn fell down
 
while Alex went off to a corner. He tried to grab Carleen's hand
 
but he got tangled in Carleen's hair because she was pulling and
 
punching. He told Carleen to let go. DeMello admitted to
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pulling Carleen's hair but only because he was attempting to
 
protect Cherilyn.
 
The District Court found DeMello guilty as charged and
 
specifically rejected his defense-of-others justification under
 
HRS § 703-305 (1993).
 
Under the circumstances, neither Cherilyn nor the
defendant would have been justified in using the kind of
force that was used in this case, to wit, the pulling of the
defendant by the hair across the lawn for that distance.
Under the circumstances, this conduct was not necessary to
achieve the protection of the other person.
 
The facts in this case indicate that at the time of
 
defendant's conduct in pulling the defendant [sic] by her
hair across the lawn, that Cherilyn was already the
aggressor in this altercation, Carleen was already on her
back with her husband lying on top of her, and Cherilyn on
top of this pile. And, therefore, the facts and
circumstances of this case do not allow this Court to
 contemplate this defense of the use of force for the
protection of other persons, which is rejected.
 
For his Harassment conviction, DeMello was sentenced to 30 days
 
incarceration and was ordered to participate in anger management
 
classes. DeMello was fined $100 for Simple Trespass. On request
 
of the State, a hearing to determine restitution was set for
 
March 30, 2010. Judgment dated January 5, 2010, noted a 30 day
 
jail term, participation in anger management class, a $100 fine,
 
and that "deft to sign a free standing order of restitution
 
granted." DeMello filed a Notice of Appeal on February 2, 2010. 
At the status conference held on February 8, 2010, the District
 
Court noted that DeMello had filed his notice of appeal and
 
entered a stay of sentence pending the appeal.
 
On March 8, 2010, Carleen's claim for restitution was
 
filed, claiming $2051.27 in medical costs and $1,155.12 in lost
 
wages. Attached to the claim was a detailed breakdown of medical
 
and therapeutic services received by Carleen and a list of
 
Carleen's clients with the respective fees she would have earned,
 
between May 13, and May 23, 2008. In addition, letters from
 
Carleen's treating physician and therapists attesting that the
 
charges indicated were for treatment of Carleen for injuries
 
sustained on May 10, 2008. At the March 30, 2010 hearing, the
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
District Court continued the proceedings pending the resolution
 
of DeMello's appeal.
 
On May 4, 2010, this court dismissed DeMello's appeal
 
for lack of jurisdiction because the judgment did not contain the
 
amount of restitution determined by the District Court.
 
On August 2 and September 20, 2010, the District Court
 
held a hearing to determine the amount of restitution
 
(restitution hearing). During the restitution hearing, Carleen
 
admitted that she had a pre-existing neck injury from a dirt bike
 
accident ten years prior. However, Carleen claimed that she was
 
dragged by her hair ten feet, lifted off the ground, knocked out,
 
had hair ripped out of her head, had bruising on her shoulder,
 
and a cut on her back from the incident on May 9, 2008. Carleen
 
testified about the amount of co-payments she paid for medical
 
services that were not reimbursed by insurance. She stated that
 
she reviewed cancelled checks for each of the medical bills she
 
testified about. However, the District Court sustained DeMello's
 
foundation objection to the admission of documents regarding
 
Carleen's medical expenses. Carleen testified that her visits to
 
medical providers was due to the incident involving DeMello. 
Carleen stated that the reason she sought medical treatment was
 
for neck pain from the incident but also admitted that she was
 
being treated for neck pain prior to the incident. Prior to the
 
incident, her neck pain did not keep her in bed. She knew the
 
visits after the incident stemmed from the incident because the
 
pain was a lot worse. After the incident, Carleen stated that
 
the pain was so bad that she could not get out of bed. Prior to
 
the incident, on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst,
 
Carleen indicated that most days it was between two and six. 
After the incident, she rated the pain level at a ten for about
 
fourteen days.
 
Carleen testified that she is a hairdresser who rents a
 
chair in a salon for a flat fee, manages her own clients and
 
money, and does not earn any money if she does not have any
 
clients. The parties stipulated that the names on Carleen's
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
business ledger that were scratched out represented lost income
 
that totaled $1,155.12.
 
DeMello argued that the amount of restitution should be
 
apportioned because Carleen had a pre-existing neck injury which
 
was being treated at the time of the incident. DeMello also
 
argued that responsibility should be apportioned due to three
 
altercations between Carleen and Cherilyn on the same night which
 
also involved hair pulling. DeMello also contended that HRS
 
§ 706-646 did not allow restitution for lost wages. Finally,
 
DeMello argued that Carleen's testimony as to her medical records
 
was not credible.
 
On October 25, 2010, the District Court entered an
 
"Order on Restitution Hearing" which stated in relevant part:
 
Findings of Fact:
 
1. Karlene Kelikoma [sic], the victim of the
offense of harassment committed against her by the Defendant
on May 10, 2009, (hereinafter "the incident") is claiming
restitution for medical expenses incurred to treat injuries
sustained in the incident and for lost income resulting from
the Victim being unable to work as a result of the incident.
 
2. In the course of the incident, the Defendant
grabbed the Victim by her hair and dragged her by her hair
for a distance of about 10 feet. The Victim experienced a
sensation that her neck cracked. She felt immediate
 excruciating pain and then she "blacked out". Subsequent
symptoms included dizziness, pain in the back of her skull,
shooting pain in her neck and shoulder area, tingling feet,
and headache. The Victim sustained a cut to the back of her
 left shoulder, and bruises on her body and arms. Hair was
 ripped out of her head.
 
3. Another person involved in the incident,
Sherelyn Kelikoma [sic], also assaulted the Victim by
punching the Victim and pulling her hair but there is no
evidence upon which this court may attribute any of the
Victim's losses to Sherelyn Kelikoma [sic].
 
4. As a direct result of the incident, the Victim
required medical treatment and was unable to engage in
normal employment activity as a self employed hairdresser.
The direct losses consisting of medical expenses and loss of
gross receipts are as follows:
 
Maui Medical Group $ 141
 
Dr. Kenneth Kaan  55
 
Dr. Jeffrey Wang  212
 
Dr. Mirzi/Dr. Nagasaka  519
 
Maui Physical Therapy  351
 
Integrative Physical Therapy  429
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Jeffrey Chester  525
 
$ 2 , 2 3 2
 
Gross Receipts $1,155
TOTAL $3,387
 
5. At the time of the incident, Victim suffered
from pre-existing impairment of her cervical spine
consisting of a bulged disk at C-5 level. This condition
 resulted from a dirt bike accident which occurred about 10
 years prior to the incident. The injury was symptomatic at
the time of the incident. The victim was undergoing medical
treatment for the pre-existing condition at the time of the
incident. The incident significantly worsened the Victim's
pre-existing condition at the time of the incident. The
 incident significantly worsened the Victim's pre-existing
symptomology and precipitated a new, more intensive course
of medical treatment.
 
6. No medical expert opinion or other competent
medical evidence was adduced by either party on the issue of
apportionment.
 
7. The total amount of direct medical expenses
resulting from the incident is based upon the testimony of
the Victim that said losses are a direct consequence of the
incident and which are her out of pocket loss for which she
will not be compensated or reimbursed by her medical
insurance. The Court finds the Victim's testimony credible.
 
. . . . 
Conclusions of Law:
 
. . . . 
3. Restitution is a quasi-civil sanction. State v.
 
Tuialii, 121 Haw. 135 (Haw. App. 2009). Accordingly, the
Court determines the rule of apportionment of personal
injury damages in civil actions is appropriate. In the
 instant case, where the Victim had a pre-existing condition
at the time of the incident, where the evidence indicates
that a significant worsening of the pre-existing condition
was caused by the Defendant, where there is no expert
medical opinion or other competent medical evidence upon
which an apportionment can be made, then the Defendant is
liable for the entire amount of the damages or losses
incurred as a direct result of the incident. Kawamoto v.
 
Yasutake, 49[] Haw. 42 (1966); Matsumoto v. Kaku, 52 Haw.
629 (1971).
 
4. Defendant is ordered to pay the Victim
restitution in the amount of $3,387. Restitution shall be
 paid at a de minimus [sic] rate of $20 per month on the
first of each month commencing November 01, 2010 until
restitution is fully paid. Defendant shall sign a free
standing order of restitution.
 
DeMello filed a Notice of Appeal on November 23, 2010.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
II. Discussion
 
A.	 Justification Defense
 
DeMello contends that there was insufficient evidence
 
to convict him of Harassment because the State failed to prove,
 
beyond a reasonable doubt, facts negating his defense-of-others
 
justification defense pursuant to HRS § 703-305 (1993). DeMello
 
admitted to grabbing Carleen's hair but testified he did so only
 
because Carleen was attacking Cherilyn. The District Court did
 
not credit DeMello's testimony that he grabbed Carleen to protect
 
Cherilyn. "The prosecution disproves a justification defense
 
beyond a reasonable doubt when the trial court believes the
 
prosecution's case and disbelieves the defendant's case." State
 
v. Jhun, 83 Hawai' i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996) 
(prerogative of the trier of fact to believe defendant when he 
admitted to stabbing and to disbelieve him when he asserted that 
he was merely trying to protect his brother). 
Here, the District Court found that by the time DeMello 
dragged Carleen by her hair, Cherilyn was already the aggressor. 
Alex testified that Cherilyn "went for" Carleen before DeMello 
pulled Carleen by her hair. Thus, the District Court's finding 
that DeMello was not acting to protect Cherilyn was supported by 
the evidence. As there was evidence in support of the District 
Court's findings, we will not second-guess them. "Verdicts based 
on conflicting evidence will not be set aside where there is 
substantial evidence to support the trier of fact's findings." 
State v. Sua, 92 Hawai' i 61, 69, 987 P.2d 959, 967 (1999) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Staley, 91 Hawai' i 275, 281­
82, 982 P.2d 904, 910-11 (1999)). 
B.	 Illegal Sentence of Maximum Incarceration and Anger
Management Class
 
DeMello contends that his sentence is illegal because,
 
in addition to being sentenced to the maximum 30-day jail term
 
for a petty misdemeanor, he was also ordered to attend anger
 
management classes. The State concedes that the District Court
 
10
   
    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erred by sentencing DeMello to both the thirty-day term of
 
imprisonment and anger management classes for his Harassment
 
conviction. We agree.
 
Sentencing options are governed by HRS § 706-605(1)
 
(Supp. 2012).4 Harassment is a petty misdemeanor for which 
4
 §706-605 Authorized disposition of convicted
 
defendants.  (1) Except as provided in parts II and
IV or in section 706-647 and subsections (2), (6), and
(7), and subject to the applicable provisions of this
Code, the court may sentence a convicted defendant to
one or more of the following dispositions:
 
(a)	 To be placed on probation as authorized by part
II;
 
(b)	 To pay a fine as authorized by part III and
section 706-624;
 
(c)	 To be imprisoned for a term as authorized by
part IV; or
 
(d)	 To perform services for the community under the
supervision of a governmental agency or
benevolent or charitable organization or other
community service group or appropriate
supervisor; provided that the convicted person
who performs such services shall not be deemed
to be an employee of the governmental agency or
assigned work site for any purpose. All persons
sentenced to perform community service shall be
screened and assessed for appropriate placement
by a governmental agency coordinating public
service work placement as a condition of
sentence.
 
(2) The court shall not sentence a defendant to
 
probation and imprisonment except as authorized by part II.
 
(3) In addition to any disposition authorized in
subsection (1), the court may sentence a person convicted of
a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor to a suspended sentence.
 
(4) The court may sentence a person who has been
convicted of a violation to any disposition authorized in
subsection (1) except imprisonment.
 
(5) The court shall sentence a corporation or
unincorporated association that has been convicted of an
offense in accordance with section 706-608.
 
(6) The court shall impose a compensation fee upon
every person convicted of a criminal offense pursuant to
section 351-62.6; provided that the court shall waive the
imposition of a compensation fee if it finds that the
defendant is unable to pay the compensation fee. When a
 defendant is ordered to make payments in addition to the
(continued...)
 
11
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the maximum term of imprisonment is thirty days. HRS §§ 711­
1106(2) and 706-663 (1993). There is no provision in HRS § 706­
605 for the imposition of anger management or other treatment
 
5
programs. Id. However, HRS § 706-624(2)(j)  does authorize the
imposition of, inter alia, mental health treatment, as a
 
discretionary term of probation. Therefore, DeMello could have
 
been sentenced to a thirty-day term of incarceration or a six-
4(...continued)
compensation fee, payments by the defendant shall be made in
the following order of priority:
 
(a)	 Restitution;
 
(b)	 Crime victim compensation fee;
 
(c)	 Probation services fee;
 
(d)	 Other fees; and
 
(e)	 Fines.
 
(7) The court shall order the defendant to make
 
restitution for losses as provided in section 706-646. 
In
 
ordering restitution, the court shall not consider the
defendant's financial ability to make restitution in
determining the amount of restitution to order. The court,
however, shall consider the defendant's financial ability to
make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time
and manner of payment.
 
(8) This chapter does not deprive the court of any
authority conferred by law to decree a forfeiture of
property, suspend or cancel a license, remove a person from
office, or impose any other civil penalty. Such a judgment
or order may be included in the sentence.
 
5	 HRS §706-624(2)(j) as amended in 2006, provides,
 
The court may provide, as further conditions of a sentence
of probation, to the extent that the conditions are
reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 706­606 and to the extent that the conditions involve only
deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably
necessary for the purposes indicated in section 706-606(2),
that the defendant:
 
. . . .
 
(j)	 Undergo available medical or mental health
treatment, including treatment for substance
abuse dependency, and remain in a specified
facility if required for that purpose[.]
 
HRS §706-624(2)(q) also authorizes the court to impose "other reasonable
conditions."
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6
month term of probation, but not both.  HRS § 706-605(2). 
Therefore, DeMello's sentence was illegal.
 
C.	 Restitution
 
DeMello also raises a number of challenges to the
 
District Court's award of restitution. 
He argues that the
 
District Court abused its discretion by ordering restitution
 
because (1) he was not the sole cause of Carleen's injuries;
 
(2) lost wages are not compensable under HRS § 706-646; (3) no
 
apportionment between Carleen's pre-existing neck injury and the
 
injury he caused was made; and (4) there was insufficient
 
evidence of Carleen's medical expenses and lost wages.
 
Relevant to these issues, HRS § 706-646(2) and (3)
 
(Supp. 2012), provide:
 
(2) The court shall order the defendant to make
 
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense
 when requested by the victim. The court shall order
 restitution to be paid to the crime victim compensation
commission in the event that the victim has been given an
award for compensation under chapter 351. If the court
 orders payment of a fine in addition to restitution or a
compensation fee, or both, the payment of restitution and
compensation fee shall have priority over the payment of the
fine, and payment of restitution shall have priority over
payment of a compensation fee.
 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not
consider the defendant's financial ability to make
restitution in determining the amount of restitution to
order. The court, however, shall consider the defendant's
financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of
establishing the time and manner of payment. The court
 shall specify the time and manner in which restitution is to
be paid. Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is
 sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses,
including but not limited to:
 
6
 HRS § 706-623(1)(d) (Supp. 2012) provides, 
(1) When the court has sentenced a defendant to be placed
on probation, the period of probation shall be as follows,
unless the court enters the reason therefor on the record
 and sentences the defendant to a shorter period of
probation:
 
. . . .
 
(d)	 Six months upon conviction of a petty
misdemeanor; provided that up to one year may be
imposed upon a finding of good cause.
 
13

(a)	 Full value of stolen or damaged property, as
determined by replacement costs of like
property, or the actual or estimated cost of
repair, if repair is possible;
 
(b)	 Medical expenses; and
 
(c)	 Funeral and burial expenses incurred as a
result of the crime.
 
In the plain language of HRS § 706-646(2), restitution
 
(a) shall be ordered when requested by the victim (b) for 
reasonable and verified losses (c) caused by the defendant. 
Review of the trial court's decision to impose restitution is for 
an abuse of discretion. State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai' i 339, 349, 
219 P.3d 1126, 1136 (2009). 
1.	 Division of Liability for Losses Suffered as a
Result of Defendant's Offense 
DeMello argues that the District Court "should have 
made a reasonable attempt to apportion the restitution award 
because it was clear that [DeMello] was not the sole cause of 
Carleen's injuries." 
"[U]nder HRS § 706-646, a defendant cannot be ordered 
to pay restitution unless he caused a victim's losses." State v. 
Domingo
, 121 Hawai' i 191, 194, 216 P.3d 117, 120 (App. 2009). 
However, the District Court found that "there is no evidence upon 
which this court may attribute any of [Carleen's] losses to 
[Cherilyn]." While it is undisputed that Carleen and Cherilyn 
engaged in scuffles with each other and at some point Cherilyn 
pulled Carleen's hair, there was no evidence that anything 
Cherilyn did resulted in the losses Carleen suffered. Therefore, 
the District Court's finding that DeMello was the sole cause of 
Carleen's losses was supported by the evidence. Consequently, it 
was not error to conclude DeMello was liable for Carleen's
 
compensable losses.
 
2.	 Restitution For Wage Loss
 
DeMello contends that as a matter of law, lost wages
 
may not be awarded as restitution under HRS § 706-646(3). We
 agree that restitution for wage loss is contrary to the
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
legislative intent behind HRS § 706-646. Therefore, the District
 
Court erred by ordering DeMello to pay restitution of $1,155 for
 
wage loss.
 
There is no explicit provision in HRS §706-646 for the
 
award of lost wages as part of restitution. When this statute
 
was originally proposed in 1998, House Bill (HB) 2776, stated, in
 
pertinent part:
 
SECTION 1. Chapter 706, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended by adding to part III a new section to be
appropriately designated and to read as follows:
 
. . . .
 
(3) Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is
 
sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses
including but not limited to:
 
(a)	 Full value of stolen or damaged property, as
determined by replacement costs of like
property, or the actual or estimated cost of
repair, if repair is possible;
 
(b)	 Medical expenses;
 
(c)	 Wage loss incurred by the victim;
 
(d)	 Funeral and burial expenses incurred as a result
of the crime; and
 
(e)	 Cost of therapeutic treatment required by the
victim to recover from the psychological and
emotional effects of the offense.
 
Relevant to the issue of lost wages, House Standing
 
Committee Report 683-98 on HB 2776, stated,
 
[A]llowing restitution for therapy and wage loss presents
difficulty because these costs are often immeasurable.
While the value of stolen or damaged property, medical
expenses, and funeral and burial expenses can be determined
with specificity, costs of therapy, which can last for
months or years after the defendant is sentenced, are not.
Also, wage loss may be measurable if the victim has an
occupation at the time of the offense, but it becomes
difficult to determine if the victim is unemployed at the
time. Your Committee finds that this remedy is more
appropriate for the civil arena.
 
. . . .
 
Accordingly, your Committee has amended this bill by:
 . . . .
 (2)	 Not allowing for reimbursement of wage loss
incurred by the victim and cost of therapeutic
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
treatment required by the victim to recover from
the psychological and emotional effects of the
offense in the restitution order[.]
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683-98, reprinted in 1998 House Journal,
 
at 1305-06 (emphasis added). Subsequently, no reinsertion or
 
mention of lost wages was made by the Senate. We infer from this
 
inaction that the Senate was in agreement with this determination
 
by the House of Representatives. See S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
 
No. 2921, reprinted in 1998 Senate Journal at 1190-91. 
Furthermore, although this statute has been amended many times
 
since 1998, the Legislature has not seen fit to include lost
 
wages. HRS § 706-646 (Supp. 2012)
 
We therefore conclude that lost wages are not
 
compensable as restitution.
 
3. Apportionment Due to Pre-existing Injury
 
DeMello next argues that Carleen's pre-existing neck
 
condition should reduce the amount of loss he is responsible for
 paying. Based on the District Court's restitution decision, it
 
appears that it agreed that apportionment should be considered. 
Thus, it appears that DeMello's argument is with the manner in
 
which the District Court applied this concept.
 
We know that restitution is limited to "reasonable and 
verified losses suffered by the victim or victims as a result of 
the defendant's offense[.]" HRS § 706-646(2) (emphasis added). 
This requires a nexus between the defendant's conduct and the 
victim's injuries. Domingo, 121 Hawai' i at 194, 216 P.3d at 120 
("Absent evidence that Domingo's conduct caused or aggravated Tomlin's injuries or caused Tomlin's death, no causal 
relationship between Domingo's criminal act and a victim's losses 
is shown and restitution may not be imposed pursuant to HRS 
§ 706-646."). It follows that, where there is more than one 
possible cause for the loss, the court must determine whether the 
evidence supports the finding that the defendant's conduct caused 
or contributed to the victim's loss. Id.; see also State v. 
Gibson, 160 N.H. 445, 449, 999 A.2d 240, 243 (2010) and 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Commonwealth v. Balisteri, 329 Pa. Super. 148, 155, 478 A.2d 5, 9 
(1984).
 
Here, the District Court found that the "incident
 
significantly worsened [Carleen's] pre-existing symptomology and
 
precipitated a new, more intensive course of medical treatment,"
 
found credible the testimony of Carleen that the contested
 
medical expenses were "a direct consequence of the incident" and
 
concluded that a "significant worsening of the pre-existing
 
condition was caused by" DeMello. Thus, the District Court
 
seemed to have found there was a basis in the evidence to
 
conclude DeMello caused injury and resultant expenses, while
 
recognizing that the victim had been previously suffering from an
 
injury and receiving treatment therefor.
 
Nevertheless, the District Court appeared to rule no
 
apportionment was possible where "no expert medical opinion or
 
other competent medical evidence" was presented. This conclusion
 
appears to be at odds with the court's findings regarding the
 
worsening of the victim's condition and consequential change in
 
her medical treatment and based on a misconception that
 
imposition of all medical expenses could be made on a defendant
 
where there was insufficient evidence upon which to base an
 
apportionment.
 
Because we know of no requirement that medical or other
 
expert testimony must be presented in order to make an
 
apportionment, we vacate the remaining restitution award for
 
medical expenses and remand for an evidentiary hearing, if
 
necessary.
 
D. Sufficient Evidence Of Losses
 
Finally, DeMello contends that there was insufficient
 
evidence of Carleen's losses, arguing that the State failed to
 
provide verification of medical expenses because there were no
 
medical invoices admitted into evidence and "Carleen's testimony
 
alone was insufficient verification of Carleen's alleged losses." 
While we have vacated the restitution award for other reasons, we
 
provide the following discussion to assist the court on remand.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the restitution context, the burden of proof and the 
party bearing it have not been determined in this jurisdiction. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has recognized that "restitution is 
"quasi-civil" in nature because it is designed to compensate the victim as an adjunct of punishment." State v. Feliciano, 103 
Hawai'i 269, 272, 81 P.3d 1184, 1187 (2003) (citing State v. 
Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 127, 152, 890 P.2d 1167, 1193 (1995)). The 
legislative history underlying the restitution statute makes clear that the Legislature's intent was to provide a more 
expedient method for victim compensation in conjunction with 
other civil remedies: 
This bill allows victims of crime to enforce a
 
criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil
 
judgment. Under current law, the court may require a
defendant to pay restitution for the losses caused to the
victim. Collection of this restitution is left to
 governmental entities like the Judiciary, Public Safety, and
Paroling Authority, which often are able to collect only a
small fraction of the amount.
 
There are few other options. Although the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Commission helps victims by providing
some compensation, victims of property crimes and some
violent crimes are not eligible for any compensation from
the Commission. And although a victim may bring a civil
action against the defendant, this process is costly and
time consuming.
 
Therefore, your Committee believes that victims should
have a "fast track" ability to be compensated for their
losses by allowing them to enforce the criminal restitution
order as a civil judgment, using all of the civil collection
remedies.
 
Stand. Comm. Rpt. 683-98 reprinted in 1998 House Journal at 1305. 
Generally speaking, in civil cases the burden of proof is by a 
preponderance of the evidence. Iddings v. Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai' i 1, 
13, 919 P.2d 263, 275 (1996). 
Many jurisdictions have adopted a preponderance of the
 
evidence standard in restitution proceedings. In re William L.,
 
211 Ariz. 236, 238, 119 P.3d 1039, 1041 (2005); People v.
 
Keichler, 129 Cal. App. 4th 1039, 1045, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 120, 124
 
(2005); People v. Carpenter, 885 P.2d 334, 336 (Colo. App. 1994)
 
("[A] preponderance of the evidence is a sufficient and proper
 
burden of persuasion in proceeding to establish restitution in
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
criminal cases. This is the burden required under federal law to
 
establish both the causal connection between the offense and the
 
loss and the amount of the loss."); Winborn v. State, 625 So.2d
 
977, 977 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993); Lawrenz v. State, 194 Ga.
 
App. 724, 724, 391 S.E.2d 703, 704 (1990); Commonwealth v.
 
Palmer, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 233, 808 N.E.2d 848, 850 (2004);
 
State v. Kleppe, 800 N.W.2d 311, 319 (N.D. 2011); McCullough v.
 
Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 811, 816-17, 568 S.E.2d 449, 451
 
(2002). See also, 6 Wayne R. LaFave, Jerold H. Israel, Nancy J.
 
King and Orin S. Kerr, Criminal Procedure, § 26.6(c) at 825-26
 (3rd ed. 2007) ("Criminal Procedure").
 
In People v. Carpenter, supra, the court stated:
 
Defendant has not cited, nor are we aware of, any
cases from other jurisdictions establishing a burden of
persuasion higher than preponderance of the evidence with
respect to restitution in criminal proceedings.
 
We conclude that a preponderance of the evidence is a
sufficient and proper burden of persuasion in proceedings to
establish restitution in criminal cases. This is the burden
 required under federal law to establish both the causal
connection between the offense and the loss and the amount
 of the loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d) (1988); see United States
v. Diamond, 969 F.2d 961 (10th Cir. 1992). We see no reason
 why the burden in our courts should be higher. . . .
Further, restitution in a criminal proceeding is in lieu of,
or in addition to, a civil judgment, and we see no reason
why the burden of persuasion should be any higher here than
there. See § 13-25-127(1), C.R.S. (1987 Repl. Vol. 6A).
 
Carpenter, 885 P.2d at 336-37. Although it is nearly twenty
 
years since the Carpenter decision, we are also unable to find
 
any case imposing a burden higher than the preponderance of the
 
evidence standard in a restitution proceeding.
 
Given the Legislature's intent that the restitution 
process serve as an expedited alternative to a civil lawsuit, we 
agree with the multitude of other states deciding the matter and 
adopt a preponderance of the evidence standard in restitution 
proceedings in Hawai' i. 
However, neither our restitution statute nor Hawai' i 
case law designate who bears the burden of proof in restitution 
proceedings. Other jurisdictions have taken the position that, 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"[t]he State has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of
 
the evidence a causal connection between the restitution
 
requested and the crime with which the defendant is charged,"
 
State v. Kinneman, 122 Wash. App. 850, 860, 95 P.3d 1277, 1283
 
(2004). See also United States v. Polichemi, 219 F.3d 698, 714
 
(7th Cir. 2000) (based on 18 United States Code (USC) § 3664),
 People v. Lassek, 122 P.3d 1029, 1034 (Colo. App. 2005); Winborn,
 
625 So.2d at 977; Palmer, 61 Mass. App. Ct. at 233, 808 N.E.2d at
 
850; Kleppe, 800 N.W.2d at 319; State v. Shannon, 155 N.H. 135,
 
139, 920 A.2d 1163, 1166 (2007); Criminal Procedure, § 26.6(c) at
 
825.
 
In light of the Hawai' i statute's requirement that the 
restitution amount be "reasonable and verified" and that the 
victim is in the best position to provide information regarding 
and verification of his or her losses caused by the defendant, we 
conclude that, where restitution is contested, the burden to 
present a prima facie showing that the restitution request is 
best placed on the prosecution who brings the restitution motion 
on behalf of the victim of the crime. 
If, on the other hand, the defendant wishes to contest
 
the amounts requested by the victim, the onus is on the defendant
 
to come forward with evidence to support his or her challenge. 
We start with the basic premise that the Legislature has made
 
clear that the restitution award "shall be a dollar amount that
 
is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses." HRS
 
§ 706-646(3).
 
In People v. Fulton, 109 Cal. App. 4th 876, 135 Cal.
 
Rptr. 2d 466 (2003), Fulton appealed a restitution award on the
 
basis that it improperly included some attorney's fees which were
 
not recoverable. 109 Cal. App.4th at 879, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d at
 
469. The parties in Fulton disputed the evidentiary burden in
 
restitution hearings. Id. at 885, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 474. In
 
resolving the evidentiary burden issue, the Fulton court stated:
 
At the core of the victim restitution statutory scheme
is the mandate that a victim who suffers economic loss is
 
entitled to restitution and that the restitution is to be
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim." Thus,
a victim seeking restitution (or someone on his or her
behalf) initiates the process by identifying the type of
loss (§ 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)) he or she has sustained and
its monetary value. Where the restitution claimed is
 attorney fees, this requirement is met when the record
contains prima facie evidence of reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the victim to recover the economic losses. (Cf.
In re S.S. (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 543, 546–547, 43 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 768; People v. Scroggins (1987) 191 Cal. App. 3d
502, 508, 236 Cal. Rptr. 569; People v. Hartley (1984) 163
Cal. App. 3d 126, 130, fn. 3, 209 Cal. Rptr. 131; see also
Evid. Code, § 500.)
 
Once the record contains evidence showing the victim
suffered economic losses and incurred reasonable attorney
fees to recover those losses, this showing establishes the
amount of restitution the victim is entitled to receive,
unless challenged by the defendant. In that event, the
burden shifts to the defendant to show the portion of the
attorney fees that are not recoverable because those fees
can be attributed solely to a nonrecoverable category of
noneconomic losses. (See People v. Foster (1993) 14 Cal.
App. 4th 939, 946, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1; People v. Baumann
(1985) 176 Cal. App. 3d 67, 80–82, 222 Cal. Rptr. 32; People
v. Hartley, supra, 163 Cal. App. 3d at p. 130, 209 Cal.
Rptr. 131.) This approach complies with the statutory
mandate that the amount of restitution is to be based on the
 "loss claimed by the victim" and the designated right of the
defendant to a hearing "to dispute the determination of the
amount of restitution."
 
We disagree with the assertion by Fulton and amicus
curiae Appellate Defenders, Inc., that due process precludes
placing the burden of proof on the defendant to show the
attorney fees were incurred solely to recover noneconomic
losses. Due process requires that the prosecution prove
beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the charged
offenses. (People v. Babbitt (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 660, 692,
248 Cal. Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253.) However, when the defense
raises factual issues collateral to the question of the
accused's guilt or innocence, there is no constitutional
impediment to requiring the accused to prove these
collateral facts by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at
 
pp. 693–694, 248 Cal. Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253; People v. Frye
(1998) 18 Cal. 4th 894, 967–969, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 25, 959
P.2d 183; see also People v. Allen (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 424,
435–436, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 682, 981 P.2d 525; People v.
Hawthorne (1992) 4 Cal. 4th 43, 79, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 133,
841 P.2d 118.) A challenge to the amount of restitution to
the victim is entirely collateral to the defendant's guilt
or innocence. Moreover, the defendant's burden does not
arise until the victim has made a prima facie showing of his
or her claimed loss. Thus, there is no due process
impediment to placing the burden of proving apportionment of
fees between economic and noneconomic damages on the
defendant.
 
Id. at 885-87, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 474-75.
 
We find the reasoning in  Fulton persuasive. This
 
process will allow both a defendant and victim the opportunity to
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
litigate their interests while still maintaining the "fast track"
 
contemplated by the Legislature.
