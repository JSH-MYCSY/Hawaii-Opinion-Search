STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(SPP NO. 09-1-0088 (CRIMINAL NO. 07-1-1198))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Jason Greenwell ("Greenwell")
 
appeals from the Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or
 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody ("Order"),
 filed on November 8, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit ("Circuit Court").

At a change-of-plea hearing on February 25, 2008,
 
Greenwell pled no contest to Count 1, Unauthorized Entry into
 Motor Vehicle in the First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") § 708-836.5 (Supp. 2010); Count 2, Credit Card
 Theft, in violation of HRS § 708-8102 (1993); and Count 3,
 Unauthorized Possession of Confidential Personal Information, in
 violation of HRS § 708-839.55 (Supp. 2010). On September 10,
 2008, the Circuit Court entered judgment and sentenced Greenwell
 to five years of imprisonment on each count, with the sentence
 for Count 1 to be served consecutive to the sentences on Counts 2
 and 3, which ran concurrently. 
Fifteen months later, on December 7, 2009, Greenwell
 
filed a Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to
 Release Petitioner from Custody ("Petition"). On November 8,

 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
2010, the Circuit Court denied Greenwell's Petition without a
 
hearing, finding that Greenwell's claims were "patently frivolous
 and without a trace of support[.]"
 
On appeal, Greenwell claims that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying his Petition because (1) his attorney, Frank
 Fernandez ("Attorney Fernandez"), was ineffective because he
 failed to interview the complaining witness ("CW") or to
 adequately investigate the case, (2) Attorney Fernandez was
 ineffective because he falsely informed Greenwell that he had
 reached a plea agreement with the State under which Greenwell
 would serve a single 5-year term of imprisonment, and (3) the
 Circuit Court failed to ask Greenwell whether his intention to
 plead no contest resulted from any plea agreement, as required by
 Rule 11 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP").
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Order and resolve Greenwell's points of error as
 follows:
 
(1) It is not error to deny an HRPP Rule 40 petition 
without a hearing when the petition fails to state a colorable claim. Barnett v. State, 91 Hawai' i 20, 26, 979 P.2d 1046, 1052 
(1999) (quoting State v. Allen, 7 Haw. App. 89, 92, 744 P.2d 789, 792 (1987)). Greenwell makes no showing of a colorable claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because Attorney Fernandez allegedly failed to interview the CW or to properly investigate his case. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
previously stated: 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40
petition for post-conviction relief where the petition
states a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim,
the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as
true the facts alleged would change the verdict[;] however,
a petitioner’s conclusions need not be regarded as true.
Where examination of the record . . . indicates that the
 petitioner’s allegations show no colorable claim, it is not
error to deny the petition without a hearing.
 
Barnett, 91 Hawai' i at 26, 979 P.2d at 1052 (quoting Allen, 7 
Haw. App. at 92, 744 P.2d at 792). 
Greenwell does not explain how any alleged failure to
 
investigate or interview the CW resulted in the withdrawal or
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. See 
State v. Hoff, No. 29189, 2009 WL 1280729, at *2 (Haw. App. 
May 11, 2009) (assertion that counsel failed to investigate not supported by any specific allegations regarding what counsel did or failed to do or how any alleged failure to investigate resulted in withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense). Greenwell provides no basis for us to conclude that the CW was available or had not been interviewed by Attorney Fernandez; that any such omission reflected Attorney Fernandez's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; or that it resulted in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense.
2 See State v. Antone, 62 
Hawai'i 346, 348–49, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980). In addition, 
paragraph 11 of the No Contest Plea form ("Form") states that Greenwell had no complaints about his lawyer and was satisfied with what he had done for him. 
Under the circumstances, we conclude that no colorable
 
claim was established that Greenwell entered his no contest plea
 involuntarily.
 
(2) Similarly, Greenwell makes no showing of a
 
colorable claim that he received ineffective assistance of
 counsel because Attorney Fernandez allegedly falsely claimed to
 have reached a plea agreement if Greenwell would plead no
 contest. Greenwell fails again to demonstrate the withdrawal or
 substantial impairment of a meritorious defense.
 
An allegation that counsel made a false promise of a
 
plea agreement may be overcome by a court-initiated colloquy at
 
2
 Greenwell contends that counsel would have learned that the CW (1)
never saw Greenwell steal his property and (2) could not identify Greenwell
with 100% certainty as the person he saw at the scene on the day of theincident, and that Greenwell had an alibi witness who would have testifiedthat Greenwell (3) did not enter the CW's car, but (4) had found the items inthe parking lot as he left the store. As to claims (1) and (2), AttorneyFernandez might have learned the information from any number of sourcesincluding his client or the June 26, 2007 transcript of his client'spreliminary hearing. Consequently, even if we assume that Attorney Fernandezfailed to interview the CW, Greenwell fails to raise a colorable claim thatsuch an omission had any consequence or, therefore, amounted to ineffectiveassistance. As to claims (3) and (4), where an ineffective assistance claimis based on counsel's failure to obtain a witness, the defendant must produceaffidavits or sworn statements describing the testimony of the proffered
witness.  State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998).
Greenwell produced no such declaration from the purported alibi witness.

the change-of-plea hearing. See D'Ambrosio v. State, 112 Hawai' i 
446, 459-60, 146 P.3d 606, 619-20 (App. 2006). At the time that 
he entered his amended plea, in response to the court's inquiries, Greenwell assured the Circuit Court that no one had made any promises to him, he was not pleading as part of any plea agreement, he was facing a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, he was eligible to be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment of ten years for each count for a total of thirty years imprisonment, he was facing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of twenty months before he was eligible for parole, if he subsequently did not like the sentence he could not change his mind and ask for a trial, the Circuit Court made no promises as to what his sentence might be, and that, nevertheless, he wanted to plead no contest. 
Under the circumstances, we conclude that no colorable
 
claim was established that Greenwell entered his no contest plea
 involuntarily.
 
(3) The Circuit Court did not err in failing to 
explicitly ask Greenwell whether, in changing his plea, he was acting pursuant to a plea agreement. Although "it is incumbent on all trial judges to strictly conform to the guidelines provided in HRPP Rule 11 . . . [t]his does not mean that trial judges must resort to a ritualistic litany in determining the voluntariness of a nolo contendere plea." State v. Cornelio, 68 
Haw. 644, 647, 727 P.2d 1125, 1127 (1986) (citation omitted); cf. State v. Aeto, 105 Hawai' i 257, 261, 96 P.3d 586, 590 (App. 2004) 
(mere fact that the court did not comply with all of the requirements of HRPP Rule 11 is not proof of manifest injustice on HRPP Rule 32(d) motion to withdraw plea). 
Greenwell argues that the Circuit Court erred because
 
it "failed to ask Petitioner if his willingness to Plead No
 Contest resulted from any Plea Agreement[.]" The Circuit Court,
 however, implicitly addressed the issue during its colloquy with
 Greenwell and explicitly addressed the issue in the Form, about
 which it then orally questioned Greenwell.
 
During the change-of-plea hearing, the Circuit Court
 
asked Greenwell: "Has anyone made any promises to you?"

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Greenwell responded "No, sir." In addition, the court and
 
Greenwell discussed Greenwell's answers on the Form. 
Specifically, Greenwell affirmed in paragraph 8 that "I have not
 been promised any kind of deal or favor or leniency by anyone for
 my plea, except that I have been told that the government has
 agreed as follows . . . : NONE." The court asked Greenwell if
 the Form included his signature, if he had reviewed the Form with
 his attorney before signing it, and if he had read and understood
 the Form. Greenwell answered yes to each question. The court
 asked if Greenwell had any questions about the Form, and
 Greenwell said that he did not. 
Taken together, the Form and the Circuit Court's
 
inquiry in open court satisfied the court's obligations under
 HRPP Rule 11(d). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Denying Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody, filed on November 8, 2010, in the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit is affirmed.
