IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN RE: MARN FAMILY LITIGATION 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(MASTER FILE NO. 00-1-MFL)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
I.
 
This is a continuation of the appeal by Alexander Y.
 
Marn (Marn) from the Partial Final Judgment entered on
 
October 25, 2010 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1 The Partial Final Judgment entered judgment
 
against Marn as to the claims he asserted in Civil No. 98-4706-10
 (Buyout Case) and as to the claims that were asserted against him
 
in Civil No. 98-5371-12 (Judicial Accounting Case).
 
II.
 
This court initially dismissed this appeal on March 23, 
2013, after Marn, pro se, filed an opening brief in pervasive 
non-compliance with Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28. On February 12, 2014, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court vacated 
1
 The Honorable Victoria S. Marks presided over the majority of the
proceedings. The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura signed the Partial Final
Judgment.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the order of dismissal and remanded the case to this court,
 
holding that the dismissal violated HRAP Rule 30.
 
On April 15, 2014, this court ordered Marn to show
 
cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for noncompliance
 
with HRAP 28. In his reply, Marn, now represented by counsel,
 
moved for leave to file a replacement brief. On July 24, 2014,
 
this court found that Marn failed to show good cause, but imposed
 
a lesser sanction than dismissal "in the interests of resolving
 
this case on the merits[.]"
 
Marn was allowed to file a fully compliant amended
 
opening brief on condition that, as a sanction, he pay reasonable
 
attorneys fees and costs incurred by the appellees in responding
 
to the first opening brief. Marn eventually paid these sums to
 
the appellees and, through counsel, filed an amended opening
 
brief on May 28, 2015.
 
Marn now argues nine points of error on appeal:
 
A.	 The trial court abused its discretion by (1) refusing
to allow Marn to purchase the Ala Wai Investments (AWI)partnership shares of James Y. Marn (James) andJames K.M. Dunn, Successor Trustee of the Annabelle Y.Dunn Trust (Dunn), and (2) choosing instead to dissolvea viable Hawai
'i business. 
2
B.	 The trial court erred in striking Marn's  demand for a
jury trial.
 
C.
	 The trial court erred in ordering and entering summary
judgment against Marn with respect to his claims for
Quantum Meruit and Unjust Enrichment.
 
D.	 The trial court abused its discretion by striking
Marn's Answer and Counterclaim as a discovery sanction.
 
E.	 The trial court abused its discretion by excluding
Marn's expert witnesses.
 
F.	 The trial court abused its discretion by disregarding
the court's Special Master's Expert Witness Report to
instead rely on lay opinion testimony.

 References made in Marn's opening brief as to his co-plaintiff/co­
defendant Eric Y. Marn (Eric) have been omitted as Eric is not a party to this
appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
G.	 The trial court abused its discretion in unjustifiably
and prematurely appointing a Liquidating Receiver.
 
H.	 The trial court (1) made erroneous Findings of Fact and
(2) reached erroneous Conclusions of Law in the course
of entering an Order regarding the Ten Grand Associates
loan.
 
I.	 The trial court (1) made erroneous Findings of Fact and
(2) reached erroneous Conclusions of Law in the course
of the June, 2006 Judicial Accounting Trial.
 
II.
 
Non-Compliance With HRAP Rule 28
 
In vacating this court's dismissal order, the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court stated, "nothing herein should be interpreted as 
precluding an appellate court from disregarding an individual 
argument that is not presented in compliance with HRAP Rule 28." 
In Re Marn Family Litigation, 132 Hawai 'i 165, 170 n.7, 319 P.3d 
1173, 1178 n.7 (2014). Indeed, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court has 
"repeatedly stated that arguments not presented in compliance 
with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) may be disregarded." Id. at 169, 319 
P.3d at 1177. Thus, we may examine Marn's amended opening brief for compliance with HRAP Rule 28 and disregard non-conforming 
arguments. 
Our review leads us to the conclusion that points of
 
error C, D, E, F, H, and I should be disregarded because they
 
fail to adequately cite the record and lack any discernable
 
argument in support as required by HRAP Rule 28(b). HRAP
 
Rule 28(b)(4) requires an appellant to indicate where in the
 
record the alleged error occurred, and where in the record the
 
alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged
 
error was brought to the attention of the court. Points of error
 
C, D, E, F, H, and I either do not provide record citations
 
documenting Marn's objections to the alleged error, provide only
 
a large range of pages or provide no citations at all.
 
HRAP 28(b)(7) requires citations to the authorities,
 
statutes, and parts of the record relied on in the argument. 
Marn's argument supporting points of error C, D, E, F, H, and I
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
include nothing more than conclusory statements that amount to 
pure conjecture. Marn fails to include adequate citations to the 
record, if any, which precludes review by this court. See, e.g., 
City & Cty. of Honolulu v. Sherman, 110 Hawai 'i 39, 77, 129 P.3d 
542, 580 (2006) ("[T]his court is not obligated to sift through a 
voluminous record to verify an appellant's inadequately 
documented contentions[.]"); Doe v. Doe, 118 Hawai 'i 293, 305, 
188 P.3d 807, 819 (App. 2008) (refusing to consider contention under HRAP 28(b)(3) where appellant "fail[ed] to cite to the 
record or otherwise provide specific and admissible evidence to 
back up her claim"); Honda ex rel. Kamakana v. Bd. of Trs. of 
Emps.' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai
'i, 108 Hawai 'i 338, 348, 120 
P.3d 237, 247 (2005) (a statement not substantiated with a citation to the record amounts to conjecture). Moreover, Marn 
cites no legal authority supporting his argument for these points 
of error. See, e.g., Kaho
'ohanohano v. Dep't of Human Servs., 
117 Hawai 'i 262, 297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n.37 (2008) ("This 
court will 'disregard [a] particular contention' if the appellant 
'makes no discernible argument in support of that position[.]'" 
(citation omitted); Taomae v. Lingle, 108 Hawai 'i 245, 257, 118 
P.3d 1188, 1200 (2005) (where a contention lacks "any reasoning, supported by citations to case law or authority to constitute a 
discernible argument," the court should decline its 
consideration); Citicorp Mortg. Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 
422, 435, 16 P.3d 827, 840 (App. 2000) (no discernible argument presented where appellants "cite[d] no apposite authority and 
[made] no coherent argument on the issue from cognizable 
precedent"). 
This court is no longer faced with considering the
 
submissions of a pro se litigant. Marn was given a second chance
 
to comply with HRAP Rule 28 after making assurances that his new
 
brief, with the benefit of counsel, would be compliant. Points
 
of error C, D, E, F, H, and I and their corresponding arguments
 
fall woefully short of Marn's promise and therefore this court
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
will exercise its discretion under HRAP Rule 28 and will
 
disregard them.3
 
While the rest of Marn's opening brief is also
 
noncompliant with HRAP Rule 28(b), his argument sections for
 
points of error A, B, and G demonstrate some attempt to cite the
 
record and provide legal authority. Thus, we will examine these
 
points on their merits, to the extent we are able.
 
III.
 
A.	 The trial court did not abuse its discretion by
dissolving the partnership and Marn had no statutory
right to purchase the shares.
 
In support of point of error A, Marn argues that "the
 
trial court could have, and should have, exercised its
 
discretionary power and authority to order the sale of [the
 
shares] in accordance with HRS § 414-415." HRS § 414-415(a)
 
(2004) provides,
 
In a proceeding under section 414-411(2) to dissolve a
corporation that has no shares listed on a national
securities exchange or regularly traded in a market
maintained by one or more members of a national or
affiliated securities association, the corporation may
elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more
shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by
the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the
shares.
 
Although Marn admits this statute was not in effect
4
when the judicial accounting complaint was filed,  he argues that
the Circuit Court had broad discretionary power under HRS § 603­
5
21.9(6) (1993)  and case law to retroactively apply it.  Thus, by 

 
3 Counsel is warned that any future violations of HRAP Rule 28 may
result in sanctions, including referral to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.
 
4
 HRS § 414-415, part of a new chapter, took effect on July 1, 2001.
2000 Haw. Sess. Laws, Act 244, §1 and § 4, at 733; 812. James filed his first
 amended complaint seeking dissolution by judicial decree on April 30, 2001.
 
5
 HRS § 603-21.9(6) provides:
 
The several circuit courts shall have power:
 (6) To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and
mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do
such other acts and take such other steps as may be
 
(continued...)
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not using its discretion to retroactively apply HRS § 414-415,
 
Marn argues the Circuit Court abused its discretion by causing
 
him substantial detriment. This logic is fundamentally flawed.
 
A trial court abuses its discretion when it exceeds the
 
bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or
 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party. Amfac, Inc. v.
 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26
 (1992). Here, the trial court applied the principles of law in
 
6
effect at the time of the complaint: HRS § 415-97 (1993)  and
HRS Chapter 425D. 
It is well-settled that "statutes are to be
 
construed as having only a prospective operation unless the
 purpose and intention of the legislature to give them
 
retrospective effect is expressly declared or is necessarily
 
implied from the language used." 
Taniguchi v. Ass'n of Apartment

 
5(...continued)
necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or

shall be given to them by law or for the promotion of
justice in matters pending before them.
 
6 Although the Circuit Court cited to HRS § 414-411, HRS § 415-97 in
effect at the time the complaint was filed, provided substantially similar
language and read, in relevant part,
 
The court shall have full power to liquidate the assets and
business of a corporation:
 
(1) 	In an action by a shareholder when it is
established:
 
(A)	 That the directors are deadlocked in the
 
management of the corporate affairs and the
shareholders are unable to break the deadlock,
and irreparable injury to the corporation is
being suffered or is threatened by reasons
thereof;
 
(B)	 That the acts of the directors or those in
 control of the corporation are illegal, or
fraudulent; or
 
(C) 	That the shareholders are deadlocked in
 voting power and have failed, for a period
that includes at least two consecutive
 annual meeting dates, to elect successors
to directors whose terms have expired or
would have expired upon the election of
their successors; or
 
(D)	 The corporate assets are being misapplied
or wasted[.]

Owners of King Manor, Inc., 114 Hawai 'i 37, 48, 155 P.3d 1138, 
1149 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); HRS 
§ 1-3 (2009) ("[n]o law has any retrospective operation, unless 
otherwise expressed or obviously intended"). More to the point, 
7
HRS § 414-483 (2004)  specifically provides for application of
the repealed Chapter 415 to actions taken before the July 1, 2001

 
effective date of Chapter 414. Thus, Chapter 414 (2004) is
 inapplicable.
 
The Circuit Court dissolved AWI for three independent

 
reasons, consistent with the criteria provided in HRS § 415-97:8
 
(1) the shareholders were deadlocked; (2) the directors in control acted in a manner that was fraudulent; and (3) there was 
misapplication or waste of corporate assets. The Circuit Court 
also found clear and convincing evidence illustrating the 
oppressive, fraudulent, and wasteful conduct of Marn, stating 
that such misconduct, coupled with the deadlock of the 
sibling/shareholders, warranted dissolution by operation of law. 
Marn has not challenged this finding, and thus we are bound by 
it. Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai
'i 
450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). The Circuit Court concluded that AWI was dissolved by operation of law and held that under 
HRS §§ 425E-801(3) and 425E-802 (2004), McCully Associates (MA) 
was dissolved by operation of law. 
In light of the uncontested findings of the Circuit
 
Court and the lack of any legal authority undermining its
 
decision there is no basis for this court to find that the
 
7
 HRS § 414-483 provides, in pertinent part,
 
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the repeal of a
statute by this chapter does not affect:
 
(1)	 The operation of the statute or any actions taken
under it before its repeal[.]
 
8
 Again, although the Circuit Court's order cites to HRS chapters
414 and 425E, the language of the statutes in effect at the time the
accounting lawsuit was filed, HRS §§ 415-97 (1993) and 425D-801 and -802
(1993) is virtually identical.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court disregarded rules or principles of law. Marn has
 
failed to establish the Circuit Court abused its discretion.
 
B. Marn had no right to a jury trial.
 
Marn argues in point B that the Circuit Court erred in 
striking his demand for a jury trial in the Judicial Accounting 
Case. In his argument in support of this point, he also argues 
it was error not to afford him a jury trial in the Buyout case. 
The denial of a demand for trial by jury is a question of law 
subject to de novo review. Credit Assocs. of Maui, Ltd. v. 
Brooks, 90 Hawai 'i 371, 372, 978 P.2d 809, 810 (1999). 
As we conclude Marn had no right to a jury trial in
 
either case, this argument is unavailing. 
1. 	Buyout Case sought the equitable remedy of
specific performance.
 
The right given by the Hawai 'i Constitution and 
preserved by Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 38(a)9 
is the right to a jury trial in suits at common law. "The test 
to determine whether a suit is 'at common law' is . . . whether 
the cause of action seeks 'legal' or 'equitable' relief. In 
other words, courts look to the nature of the remedy to determine 
whether a jury trial is warranted." Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai 'i 19, 
29, 936 P.2d 655, 665 (1997) (citation omitted). 
In the Buyout Case, the sole remedy Marn sought was 
specific performance. Marn stated he had "no adequate remedy at law, because the underlying asset of the Partnership is real 
property, the loss of which cannot be adequately compensated by 
damages." In Kimball v. Lincoln, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held, 
[A] claim for specific performance is clearly equitable in
nature and not a claim arising at common law. Accordingly,
appellant had no right to demand a jury trial of the claim
for specific performance under HRCP 38(b) since the right to
demand a jury trial is expressly limited to issues triable
of right by a jury under that rule.
 
72 Haw. 117, 126, 809 P.2d 1130, 1134 (1991)
 
9
 HRCP Rule 38(a) states, "[t]he right of trial by jury as given by
the Constitution or a statute of the State or the United States shall be
 preserved to the parties inviolate." 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Because Marn's claim for specific performance in the
 
Buyout Case was equitable in nature, he had no right to demand a
 
jury trial. 
2. A judicial accounting is equitable in nature.
 
The law is clear that "[t]he action of account between
 
partners is equitable in nature . . . and is addressed to the
 
sound discretion of the court." Block v. Lea, 5 Haw. App. 266,
 
278, 688 P.2d 724, 733 (1984) (internal citation omitted). 
"[T]he general rule [is] that ordinarily an action at law will
 
not lie in favor of a partner against another partner upon a
 
demand growing out of a partnership transaction until there has
 
been a settlement of accounts and a balance struck[.]" Lau v.
 
Valu-Bilt Homes, Ltd., 59 Haw. 283, 290, 582 P.2d 195, 200 (1978)
 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
In Lau, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted that joint 
ventures are akin to partnerships and that rules governing 
partnerships generally apply to joint ventures. There, the 
"controversy, founded on contributions for advances made to the 
joint venture, [was] complex and one that obviously require[d] an 
accounting." Lau, 59 Haw. at 292, 582 P.2d at 201. There, 
"[t]he record clearly demonstrate[d] that the amount which appellee sought to recover for contributions for advances made to 
the joint venture was not accurately ascertainable by a jury." 
Id. To support this conclusion, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
pointed to the "numerous documents and accounts" that were to be introduced into evidence, as well as the fact that many of the 
accounts were not complete or closed, as the joint venture 
affairs had not been wound up. Id. Thus, the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court held, the appellee's claim for contribution "involved the unravelling of extensive and complicated accounts which could not 
be conveniently or accurately investigated and adjusted by a 
jury. Further, this dispute involves a fiduciary relationship 
between appellee and the other joint venturers and obviously 
requires an accounting to settle it." Id. at 293, 582 P.2d at 
202.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Thomas v. Schmelzer, a partnership was dissolved by
 
agreement, and the partner who remained in possession filed a
 
complaint seeking a formal accounting and winding up. 796 P.2d
 
1026, 1028 (Idaho Ct. App. 1990). The responding partner filed
 
four counterclaims against the petitioning partner, seeking
 
general and punitive damages for misappropriation of partnership
 
assets and rents, breach of fiduciary duty, reasonable rental
 
value of partnership property used during the winding up, and the
 
inclusion of certain contracts as assets of the partnership. Id.
 
at 1034. In holding that the respondents "were not entitled as a
 matter of right to a jury trial on their counterclaims," the
 
Idaho Court of Appeals explained, "[a]bsent the request for
 
damages, these claims do not contain issues of a distinct legal
 
nature. The issues are part of the equitable accounting sought
 
in this action." Id.
 
The holding in Thomas
 is a common interpretation of the
 
law regarding the right to a jury trial: 
[W]hile it is broadly accepted that a monetary
award is generally a form of "legal" relief, it is not
true that any award of monetary relief must
necessarily be "legal" relief.[] It is well settled
 that equitable relief includes monetary damages when
required to afford complete relief. Trust law
 remedies, for example, are equitable in nature yet
include provisions of monetary damages . . . .
 
Thus, . . . a court does not err in denying a
jury trial when the monetary award sought is
incidental to, or intertwined with, equitable relief.
It does err when it denies a jury trial because of its
determination that legal issues in the case are merely
incidental to equitable ones.
 
8 Moore's Federal Practice § 38.43 (Matthew Bender 3d Ed.)
 
(emphasis omitted).
 
Other jurisdictions have reached similar results. In
 
Boyce v. Hort, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging several
 
causes of action arising out of a partnership relationship
 
between the parties, including causes of actions for breach of
 
fiduciary duties and breach of the partnership agreement, as well
 
as a claim of usurping partnership business opportunities. 666
 
So.2d 972, 973 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996). The complaint sought
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a partnership accounting as well as an award of damages. Id. 
Defendant filed affirmative defenses and a counterclaim, and,
 
like in the present case, "[a]ll allegations included in the
 
affirmative defenses and the counterclaim [arose] out of the
 
parties' alleged partnership agreement." Id. The counterclaim
 
alleged breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, and
 usurping partnership business opportunities. Id. In holding
 
there was no right to a jury trial, the Florida District Court of
 Appeal found,
 
[T]he mere fact that [plaintiff] has included a count for
breach of contract in his complaint does not transform this
case of equity into a case at law. Our courts have
 cautioned against efforts to disguise equitable claims in
partnership matters as breaches of contract or breaches of
fiduciary duties by including requests for damages,
explaining that such efforts do not transform the equitable
claims into actions at law, and will not deprive a party of
the right to an accounting under established partnership
law.
 
Id. at 974.
 
In this case, the only legal issues and claims for
 
damages arose out of the partnership agreement. James had an
 
equitable right to judicial accounting, and until that accounting
 
was complete, legal issues could not be decided. Although both
 
parties sought damages for legal issues, those issues were
 
intertwined with the equitable relief and were merely incidental
 
to the judicial accounting-–they did not have a distinct legal
 
nature. Furthermore, the claims involving the partnership were
 
extensive, complex, and the accounts had not been wound up, so a
 
jury would not have been able to conveniently or accurately
 
investigate the legal claims. Thus, the Circuit Court properly
 
found that Marn had no right to a jury trial for the judicial
 
accounting case.
 
C.	 The trial court did not abuse its discretion by
appointing a liquidating receiver.
 
Marn spends the first half of his argument on point of
 
error G reasserting that the dissolution of AWI and MA was
 
erroneous. As already addressed in Section A above, the Circuit
 
Court did not err in dissolving AWI and MA.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Marn acknowledges that the Circuit Court had the power
 
to liquidate a corporation whose directors and/or shareholders
 
are deadlocked and continuation of the corporation's business is
 
not practical, but argues that the exercise of this power is not
 
"appropriate" in this case. Marn cites to In re Dissolution of
 
Midnight Star Enters., L.P. ex rel. Midnight Star Enterprises,
 
Ltd., 724 N.W.2d. 334 (S.D. 2006), to prove that "the law is
 
clear that, even in the event of dissolution of a partnership,
 
liquidation is not necessarily mandated."
 
In Midnight Star Enters., the South Dakota Supreme
 
Court determined "whether the circuit court can order a
 
partnership to be sold on the open market when the majority
 
owners want to continue to run the business." 724 N.W.2d. at
 
339. In that case, the owners of the majority interest, 93.5
 
partnership units, wanted to continue the business. Id. at 340. 
In noting that "to sell an owner's property without [his] consent
 
is an extreme exercise of power warranted only in clear cases,"
 
(citations and internal quotations omitted), the court saw no
 
reason not to allow the withdrawing partner to be bought out
 
after dissolution. Id.
 
The facts of Midnight Star Enters. are substantially
 
different from the facts of this case. Here, only fifty percent
 
of the owners (Marn and Eric) were in favor of continuing the
 
business. Further, the history of this dispute, and the explicit
 
findings that Marn had acted oppressively, fraudulently, and had
 
misapplied or wasted corporate assets made it a clear case that
 
the Circuit Court's exercise of power was warranted. Moreover,
 
James applied for the appointment of a liquidating receiver
 
pursuant to HRS § 425D-803 (1993).10
 
10
 HRS Chapter 425D was effective Janaury 1, 1990, 1989 Haw. Sess.
Laws Act 288, § 5 at 643, and was repealed and replaced by HRS Chapter 425E
effective July 1, 2004. 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 210 §§ 14, 16 at 637.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under HRS § 425D-803, where a limited partnership is
 
11
without a general partner,  "the limited partners[ ] may wind up
the limited partnership's affairs; but the circuit court of the

 
circuit in which the principal place of business of the limited
 
partnership is located may wind up the limited partnership's
 
affairs upon application of any partner[.]" Thus, the Circuit
 
Court had statutory authority to liquidate the partnership and
 
did not abuse its discretion by exercising this power.
