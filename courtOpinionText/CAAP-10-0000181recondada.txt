 The document description for docket 201 is "Motion for
Reconsideration," but the document that was filed on April 8, 2013 consisted
only of page 3, a signature page. However, based on the subsequent
Declaration that was also filed on April 8, 2013 (docket 202), it appears that
counsel is asking this court to reconsider its March 28, 2013 Summary
Disposition Order and we shall treat it as such.

 Counsel is cautioned that Rule 32(a) of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure requires the flyleaf for each separately filed document toinclude a three-inch top margin so as not to obstruct the electronic filestamp.
