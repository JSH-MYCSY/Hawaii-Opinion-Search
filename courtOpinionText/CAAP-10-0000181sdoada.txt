IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN RE: MARN FAMILY LITIGATION 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(MASTER FILE NO. 00-1-MFL)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Appellant Alexander Y. Marn (Alexander) appeals pro se 
from the October 25, 2010 Partial Final Judgment entered by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 The Partial 
Final Judgment entered judgment against Alexander as to the claims that he asserted in Civil No. 98-4706-10 (Buy-out Lawsuit) 
and as to the claims that were asserted against him in Civil No. 
98-5371-12 (Judicial Accounting Lawsuit). The Partial Final 
Judgment was certified for immediate appeal pursuant to Rule 
54(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure and Alexander 
timely filed his appeal. 
Before consideration of the merits of Alexander's 
appeal, we must address the argument of all three appellees that Alexander's opening brief violates multiple aspects of Rule 28 of 
the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) and therefore 
warrants dismissal of this appeal. We conclude that Alexander's opening brief does not comply with HRAP Rules 28 (a), (b)(1), 
1

Nishimura presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(7), and (b)(10) and based on the
 
pervasive and substantial nature of these violations, dismiss
 
this appeal.
 
In his opening brief, Alexander attempts to incorporate
 
by reference arguments made in briefs filed in other appeals. 
He asks that "such references and observations be provided its
 
full weight and gravity as may be permitted under the HRAP rules
 
governing Appellant's Opening Brief."
 
Parties are not permitted to incorporate by reference 
arguments made in briefs filed in other appeals or in the trial-
level proceedings. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has explicitly 
rejected such a practice, holding that it violates HRAP Rule 28(a). See Kapiolani Commercial Ctr. v. A & S P'ship, 68 Haw. 
580, 584, 723 P.2d 181, 184-85 (1986). Accordingly, Alexander was prohibited from asserting arguments by reference and we only 
address those arguments made in his opening brief filed in this 
appeal. 
Alexander also references an "Exhibit 8" filed with
 
this court and coded as a Supplemental Opening Brief along with
 
other exhibits in support of his Opening Brief, arguing that it
 
serves as a factual record of court proceedings and that it
 
provides an index -- as permitted by HRAP Rule 28(a) -- that
 
allows the court to locate necessary evidence. However, a review
 
of Exhibit 8 demonstrates that it is replete with Alexander's
 
arguments and characterizations of statements contained in
 
transcripts from the trial-court proceedings. For example,
 
Alexander states, "For Court to instruct Rec'r to file reasons
 
for his involvement in trial shows how this court is willing to
 
allow biases to be inserted in the trial proceedings." 
Moreover, aside from references to the transcripts, Exhibit 8
 
includes only one reference to the record on appeal and, thus,
 
does little to help the court locate the evidence. In sum,
 
Exhibit 8 is not a court record or an index. Instead, Exhibit 8
 
is an attempt to add more than twenty pages of briefing and, when
 
combined with Alexander's forty-six-page opening brief, the
 
documents violate HRAP 28(a), even as modified by this court's
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
order granting him leave to file a fifty-page opening brief. As
 
Exhibit 8 consists of a document not part of the record, its
 
attachment to the brief is also a violation of HRAP Rule
 
28(b)(10).
 
The table of authorities included in Alexander's
 
opening brief is not a table of authorities. Instead, it merely
 
states, "Please refer to the TABLE OF AUTHORITIES cited in prior
 
filings under ICA Case ID No. 29601, Opening Brief, filed June 8,
 
2009, dkt 74 [four (4) pages], as may be applicable." On its
 
face, this clearly does not comply with the rule's requirement
 
that an opening brief include "a table of authorities listing the
 
cases, alphabetically arranged, text books, articles, statutes,
 
treatises, regulations, and rules cited, with references to the
 
pages in the brief where they are cited." HRAP 28(b)(1). The
 
statements provided in the table-of-authorities section
 
highlights the absence of any good-faith effort to comply with
 
HRAP 28(b)(1).
 
Our appellate rules require a
 
concise statement of the case, setting forth the nature of
the case, the course and disposition of proceedings in the
court or agency appealed from, and the facts material to
consideration of the questions and points presented, with
record references supporting each statement of fact or
mention of court or agency proceedings.
 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(3). Additionally, it requires the appellant to
 
include all supporting and contradictory evidence in summary
 
fashion, with appropriate record references. Id.
 
The statement of the case in Alexander's opening brief
 
does not describe the nature of the case or the course and
 
disposition of proceedings, nor does it include any citations to
 
the record or any relevant contrary facts. Given these
 
deficiencies, Alexander's opening brief also does not comply with
 
Rule HRAP 28(b)(3).
 
Most problematic is Alexander's points of error. 
Alexander lists seventeen items. His entire point on appeal
 
section, is reproduced below:

although it may not be listed in priority of importance, nor
is it a totally comprehensive list due to shortness of time

timely file this opening brief:
 
1)	 Jury demanded trial vs. bench trial
 
 
2)	 Buy out case predates all suits filed, but tried after
judicial accounting.
 
•	 The chronological reversing of trial sequence is
biased.
 
3)	 Role of the receiver

7)	 Denial of access to records of the partnership.
 
8)	 The transcripts of the proceedings cast a speciallight on the case.

•	 Punitive damages applied to 2 of 4 partners only
 
11)	
 Court's eagerness to find fault with Defendant's

•	 Quantum meruit misses short timing, due to
counsel's newness to case, but is an excessively
harsh denial of defendant's claims

Receiver's analysis of partners' equity on liquidation
is highly unreliable.
 
•	 Executive summary (3/17/08) vs. Credit Bid

Because of the limited time and page limits
established by ICA Order filed March 28, 2011 (see dkt 65 at
2), and Appellant's appeal attorney in a prior assignment
has provided much research and submitted legal briefs to ICA
covering several of the critical issues and basis for our
appeal, Appellant will be making liberal references to those
Briefs, Replies, legal references and filings submitted with
ICA on behalf of Appellant as part of this brief. 
Appellant
is not an attorney by education or training, but
incorporates "observations" of the proceedings which
Appellant believes demonstrates violations of law and ask
whether the proceeding under these violations afforded
Defendant a fair and equitable adjudication of the dispute
before the lower court. Appellant respectfully requests
that such references and observations be provided its full
weight and gravity as may be permitted under the HRAP rules
governing Appellant's Opening Brief.
 
The opening brief must include "[a] concise statement
 
of the points of error set forth in separately numbered
 
paragraphs" with each point stating "the alleged error committed
 
by the court," "where in the record the alleged error occurred,"
 
and "where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the
 
manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of
 
the court[.]" HRAP Rule 28(b)(4).
 
Here, very few of Alexander's asserted points of error 
specify actions taken by the Circuit Court. Additionally, none 
of the points of error identify where in the record the alleged 
error occurred or identify where in the record the alleged errors 
were objected to. These failings are not cured elsewhere in the 
brief. See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 497, 280 P.3d 
88, 95 (2012); see also In re Estate of Damon, 119 Hawai' i 500, 
504, 199 P.3d 89, 93 (2008) (finding that appellant's opening 
brief "sufficiently satisfies" the requirements of HRAP 28(b)(4) 
when the necessary citations are located elsewhere in the brief) 
Accordingly, Alexander Marn's opening brief does not comply with 
HRAP 28(b)(4). 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The standard-of-review section of Alexander's opening
 
brief states, "The standard of review statements contained in
 
Appellant's Opening Brief in ICA case 29601 filed on June 5, 2009
 
is directly on point, and is hereby incorporated by reference."
 
HRAP 28(b)(5), however, requires the section to "set[]
 
forth the standard or standards to be applied in reviewing the
 
respective judgments, decrees, orders or decisions of the court
 
or agency alleged to be erroneous and identify[] the point of
 
error to which it applies." Alexander's opening brief fails to
 
comply with these provisions. First, as discussed above, under
 
the HRAP, Alexander is not permitted to incorporate substantive
 
portions of briefs filed in other appeals. See Kapiolani
 
Commercial Ctr., 68 Haw. at 584, 723 P.2d at 184-85. Second,
 even assuming he may incorporate a standard of review from a
 
brief filed in a separate appeal, he does not identify the point
 
of error to which the standard applies and the standard described
 
in the other appeal does not apply to Alexander's asserted points
 
of error in this appeal. Therefore, Alexander's opening brief
 
violates HRAP 28(b)(5).
 
Rule 28(b)(7) of the HRAP states:
 
The argument, containing the contentions of the appellant on
the points presented and the reasons therefor, with
citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the
record relied on. The argument may be preceded by a concise
summary. Points not argued may be deemed waived.
 
HRAP 28(b)(7). Relying on this rule, the Hawai' i appellate 
courts have consistently acknowledged that they may disregard 
matters as to which the appellant has failed to present a 
discernible argument. See, e.g., Norton v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Court, 80 Hawai' i 197, 200, 908 P.2d 545, 548 (1995); 
Kaho'ohanohano v. Dep't of Human Servs., 117 Hawai' i 262, 297 
n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n.37 (2008). At a minimum, the argument must comply with the provisions of the rules: It must relate to 
the points presented, and include the party's reasons, citation 
to legal authority and the parts of the record relied upon in 
establishing the errors identified in the points.

Each of Alexander's arguments, even considering that he
 
is a pro se litigant, albeit highly experienced, is fatally
 
flawed. For example, in support of his first point of error,
 
"Jury demanded trial vs. bench trial," Alexander again improperly
 
incorporates by reference his opening brief in another appeal,
 
2
refers to an exhibit attached to his brief,  alleges facts
without record citations, observes that the issue turns on
 
whether he was entitled to a jury trial but does not provide any
 
legal authority for his position. For another example, 
Alexander includes a section of his argument entitled "THE
 
SPECIAL ACCOUNTING MASTER "EXPERT" PWC SELECTED BY THE COURT,"
 
which we take as support for his fourth point on appeal. This
 
section does not articulate any particular error attached to the
 
Circuit Court's selection of PWC but, instead, focuses on the
 
Circuit Court's findings of fact related to the PWC report.
 
As discussed above, Alexander's opening brief does not 
comply with the following subsections of HRAP Rule 28: (a), 
(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(7), or (b)(10). 
Rule 
28(b)(4) states, "Points not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at 
its option, may notice a plain error not presented." Likewise, 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) provides, "Points not argued may be deemed 
waived." HRAP Rule 30 states, "When the brief of an appellant is 
otherwise not in conformity with these rules, the appeal may be 
dismissed or the brief stricken and monetary or other sanctions 
may be levied by the appellate court." Accordingly, it is within 
the court's discretion to disregard non-complying aspects of the 
brief, dismiss Alexander's appeal, or strike the brief. HRAP 
Rules 28(b)(4) and 30; see Sprague v. Cal. Pac. Bankers & Ins. 
Ltd., 102 Hawai' i 189, 195, 74 P.3d 12, 18 (2003). The Hawai' i 
appellate courts have exercised this discretion. See, e.g., 
Kaho'ohanohano, 117 Hawai' i at 297 n.37, 178 P.3d at 573 n.37; 
Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai' i 438, 478-79, 164 
2
 This Exhibit 6 includes a two-page document entitled "Summary-
Orders Setting Trial" that is not part of the record in this appeal and
therefore constitutes another violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(10).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d at 696, 736-37 (2007); Taomae v. Lingle, 108 Hawai' i 245, 
257, 118 P.3d 1188, 1200 (2005); Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United 
Agri Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 235, 948 P.2d 1055, 1076 (1997). 
But the rule has not been applied in an unthinking, 
mechanical fashion, even when multiple violations appear in an 
opening brief. See, e.g., Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 
91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999) (addressing 
the merits of certain issues even though the appellant's opening 
brief did not comply with HRAP 28(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), or 
(b)(9)). Instead, the Hawai' i judiciary "has consistently 
adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible.'" Morgan 
v. Planning Dept., County of Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 173, 180-81, 86 
P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 
77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)); see also, e.g., 
State v. Andres, 125 Hawai' i 497, 497 n.2, 264 P.3d 676, 677 n.2 
(App. 2011); Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 
432-35, 16 P.3d 827, 837-40 (App. 2000); State v. Topasna, 94 Hawai'i 444, 455-56, 16 P.3d 849, 860-61 (App. 2000). 
"This is particularly so where the remaining sections 
of the brief provide the necessary information to identify the 
party's argument." Marvin, 127 Hawai' i at 496, 280 P.3d at 94; 
see also In re Estate of Damon, 119 Hawai' i at 504, 199 P.3d at 
93 (finding that appellant's opening brief "sufficiently 
satisfies" the requirements of HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) when the 
necessary citations are located elsewhere in the brief); Liki v. 
First Fire & Cas. Ins. of Hawaii, Inc., 118 Hawai' i 123, 126 n.3, 
185 P.3d 871, 874 n.3 (App. 2008) (reaching the merits where the appellant "substantially complied" with HRAP 28(b)(4), non­
compliance was not material in circumstances of case, and 
appellant cured defect in reply brief). 
The case law highlights that the critical inquiry is
 
not whether the appellant perfectly complied with the technical
 
requirements of HRAP Rule 28 regarding the form of the opening
 
brief but whether the appellant's opening brief complies with the
 
substantive underpinnings of the rule: Whether the content of
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the brief permits (1) the appellee to respond to issues raised by
 
the appellant without having to guess as to the appellant's
 
intent and (2) the reviewing court to assess the merits without
 
doing the appellant's work for him or her.
 
To the former point, the appellees contend that
 
Alexander's non-compliance with HRAP Rule 28 prejudices them. 
For example, Appellee James K.M. Dunn states that the attempts to
 
incorporate arguments by general reference makes it difficult to
 
determine what is actually being appealed. Appellee James Y.
 
Marn, Jr. (James) asserts that Alexander's failure to provide a
 
description of the nature of the case or the course and
 
disposition of proceedings is prejudicial because it does not
 
identify the facts that Alexander believes are material to his
 
appeal and his failure to cite the record requires the appellee
 
and the court to comb through thousands of pages of the record.
 
James also explains that the record is particularly voluminous
 
and, thus, Alexander's non-compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)
 
places a heavy burden on the appellees and the court. Similarly,
 
Liquidating Receiver Thomas B. Hayes contends that the points of
 
error do not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) because Alexander may
 
not just cite to briefs filed in other appeals and his failure to
 
provide record citations burdens the court, which must then
 
search through the voluminous records in the case. Finally, James
 
asserts that Alexander's non-compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(5)
 
requires the appellees and the court to parse the lengthy opening
 
brief in hopes of discovering error, guess its nature, and then
 
provide the correct standard.
 
To the latter point, the ICA has explained,
 
"Noncompliance forces this court to speculate on the what and the
 
why of the appeal. It also forces us to do the work that is more
 
properly done by the appellant." Wright v. Chatman, 2 Haw. App.
 
74, 76, 625 P.2d 1060, 1062 (1981); see also Sanchez v. Miller,
 792 F.2d 694, 703 (7th Cir. 1986) ("[I]t is not the obligation of
 
this court to research and construct the legal arguments open to
 
parties."). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
 
explained the rationale for the reluctance of the courts to
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
construct legal arguments on behalf of the parties as follows,
 
"[t]o do so would not only strain judicial resources . . . but
 
would also transform the []court from its legitimate advisory
 
role to the improper role of an advocate seeking out the
 
strongest arguments and most successful strategies for a party." 
Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985).
 
Here, the number and nature of Alexander's violations
 
weigh in favor of dismissal. First, Alexander's non-compliance
 
with HRAP 28(b)(1) suggests a willful disregard for the court's
 
rules. Creating a table of authorities requires no specialized
 
legal knowledge and another (non-identical) brief's table of
 
authorities simply cannot serve the function of the table. 
Despite these factors, Alexander chose not to comply with the
 
clear command of HRAP Rule 28(b)(1).
 
Second, Alexander's non-compliance with nearly every 
other subsection of HRAP Rule 28(b) makes it extremely difficult 
to discern his arguments. For example, his citations to the 
record and his discussion of the trial-level proceedings are 
difficult to follow. If he had fully complied with HRAP 
28(b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(7), the court would not have to sift 
through the very voluminous record that has more than a hundred 
volumes. See Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai' i 239, 
263, 172 P.3d 983, 1007 (2007) ("Further, this court is not obligated to sift through the record, which in this case 
comprises nineteen volumes totaling more than 6,000 pages, in 
order to determine the specific nature of the errors asserted but 
not documented."). Additionally, Alexander rarely indicates 
where or whether he objected to a specific finding of fact or 
conclusion of law, which makes the applicable standard of review 
hard to ascertain. The general incoherence of his argument 
section is particularly troublesome, leaving it to the appellees 
and the court to formulate his complaints into a semblance of a 
legal argument. 
Third, the appellees' assertions of prejudice appear
 
well-founded and, thus, their requests for the court to strike
 
Alexander's opening brief and/or dismiss the appeal are
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonable. Cf. Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) 
Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai' i 201, 212, 166 P.3d 961, 972 (2007) 
(noting that appellees did not claim prejudice as part of its 
determination to not dismiss the appeal for failing to comply 
with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)). 
Furthermore, to the extent that they can be discerned, 
Alexander's arguments do not implicate any significant legal 
question of broad applicability. Cf. Morgan, 104 Hawai' i at 181, 
86 P.3d at 990 ("Accordingly, because the issues raised in the instant case are of great importance, we address the merits of 
the issues raised by the Planning Department and Planning 
Commission, notwithstanding the technical violation of HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4)."); Ala Moana Boat Owners' Ass'n v State, 50 Haw. 156, 
159-60, 434 P.2d 516, 518-19 (1967) (choosing to address 
appellant's main contention because it involved an important 
question relating to the Hawaii Administrative Procedures Act). 
Finally, Hawai' i appellate courts generally are more 
forgiving of technical flaws in pro se parties' briefs. See, 
e.g., Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai' i 190, 
193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011) (addressing pro se appellant's 
arguments, to the extent they can be reasonably discerned, even 
though his opening brief does not meet the requirements of HRAP 
28(b) in a variety of ways, including a failure to cite 
appropriately to the record and to provide authority in support 
of his arguments); see also Giuliani v. Chuck, 1 Haw. App. 379, 
385-86, 620 P.2d 733, 737-38 (1980) ("The rules [of civil 
procedure] do not require technical exactness or draw refined 
inferences against the pleader; rather, they require a determined 
effort to understand what the pleader is attempting to set forth 
and to construe the pleading in his favor. This is particularly 
true when a court is dealing with a complaint drawn by a layman 
unskilled in the law."). But "[t]he right of self-representation 
is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom" and 
"[n]either is it a license not to comply with the relevant rules 
of procedural and substantive law." Lepere v. United Pub. 
Workers Local 646, AFL-CIO, 77 Hawai' i 471, 473 n.2, 887 P.2d 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1029, 1031 n.2 (1995) (quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U.S.
 
806, 834 n.46 (1975)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
 
special solicitude afforded pro se parties is not necessarily
 
warranted where the party is an experienced litigant, as is
 
Alexander. See Tracy v. Freshwater, 623 F.3d 90, 102 (2nd Cir.
 
2010).
 
Therefore, this appeal from the Partial Final Judgment
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on October 25,
 2010 is dismissed.
