APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS PRISONER NO. 10-1-0045; CR. NO. 91-2964)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Wolfgang Eisermann ("Eisermann")
 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, filed on October 11,
 
2010, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
 
Court").1
 
On August 10, 2010, Eisermann filed a Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 
from Custody ("Petition"), pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii
 
Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP"). The Petition was denied on
 
October 11, 2010, and Eisermann timely filed this appeal. 
On appeal, Eisermann contends that the district court
 
judge who presided over his sentencing was not temporarily
 
authorized to act as a circuit court judge. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Eisermann's point of error as follows:

 The Honorable Richard K. Perkins presided.

Eisermann's point of error was previously raised and
 
ruled upon by this court. Eisermann v. State, No. 24820, 2003 WL

35(c)(1) (memorandum opinion or unpublished dispositional order
 
may be cited under the circumstances of this case). Therefore,
