Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Ramos­
Elsenbach's appeal is without merit.
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
Ramos-Elsenbach contends family court abused its 
discretion when it failed to hear and decide three "pre-trial" 
motions before trial commenced. Trial commenced on November 23, 
2009 and ended on February 12, 2010. During the trial, Ramos-
Elsenbach filed two "pretrial" motions on December 7, 2009, and 
one "pretrial" motion on December 30, 2009. Family court heard 
the motions January 25, 2010, took them under advisement, and 
decided the motions after the completion of the trial. Under 
Hawai'i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 78, the family court may 
hear and dispose of motions as the court "considers reasonable." HFCR 78. The family court did not violate HFCR 78 and as such 
did not abuse its discretion. Ramos-Elsenbach's argument is 
without merit. Consequently, Ramos-Elsenbach's claim the family 
court denied her due process and equal protection of the laws is 
also without merit. 
Ramos-Elsenbach contends the family court erred in
 
failing to properly apply Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 572-24

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2006 Repl.) and § 580-47 (2006 Repl. & Supp. 2011) in deciding
 
her requests for spousal support. The family court did properly
 
apply HRS § 572D-6(e) (2006 Repl.) and thus, did not abuse its
 
discretion in denying spousal support. Lewis v. Lewis, 69 Haw.
 
497, 499-500, 748 P.2d 1362, 1365 (1988). 
Ramos-Elsenbach's remaining arguments are also without
 
merit.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Divorce Decree entered
 
November 1, 2010 in the Family Court of the Third Circuit and the
 following orders also entered November 1, 2010 in family court:
 
(1) "Order Denying Defendant Ronda Lee Ramos-Elsenbach's Motion
 
To Rescind Prenuptial Agreement For Breach Of Agreement Filed
 
December 7, 2009," (2) "Order Denying Ronda Lee Ramos-Elsenbach's
 
Motion For Partial Summary Judgment For Reimbursement Of Proceeds
 
From Sale Of Her One Half Interest In Lake Oswego Oregon Property
 
Filed December 7, 2009," and (3) "Order Denying Ronda Lee Ramos­
Elsenbach's Motion and Affidavit For Order To Show Cause And
 
Relief After Order Or Decree Filed December 30, 2009" are
 
affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 17, 2012.
