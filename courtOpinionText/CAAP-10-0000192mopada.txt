IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BONNIE LEE SANIDAD RARANGOL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0641)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bonnie Lee Sanidad Rarangol
 
(Rarangol) appeals from the Second Amended Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, filed on November 10, 2010, in the Circuit Court of
 
the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
Rarangol pled no contest to two counts (Count 1 and 3)
 
of Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been
 
Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence
 
of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2009), (b)(3) (2007) and two
 
counts (Counts 2 and 4) of Driving Without Motor Vehicle
 
Insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (Supp. 2009) and
 
431:10C-117(a) (Supp. 2009).
 
On Counts 1 and 3, Rarangol was sentenced to one year
 
incarceration, suspended to seven days, a $2000.00 fine for each

count, restitution of $1000.00, and permanent license revocation. 
On Counts 2 and 4, Rarangol was sentenced to three days
 
incarceration, a fine of $500 for each count (converted to three
 
days incarceration), and a 90-day license suspension. The terms
 
were to be served concurrently.
 
On appeal, Rarangol contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred when it concluded that it could not impose a suspended
 
sentence with respect to her permanent license revocation in
 
Counts 1 and 3. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Rarangol argued to the Circuit Court that, although HRS 
§ 291E-62(b)(3) required that Rarangol's license be permanently 
revoked, because she had two or more prior convictions for 
driving without a license while her license was suspended or 
revoked, under HRS § 706-605(3) (Supp. 2009) and State v. Batson, 
99 Hawai' i 118, 53 P.3d 257 (2002), the court had the discretion 
to impose a suspended sentence with respect to permanently suspending her license. 
The Circuit Court suspended the one-year imprisonment
 
required under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3)(A) to seven days, but stated:
 
In this case there is a provision of the law that says
that your license would be suspended permanently. I
 don't - - I'm not going to substitute my judgment for
the legislature's judgment but I am persuaded that I
do not have discretion to suspend any portion of your
license suspension, so it would be permanent.
 
Rarangol timely filed this appeal.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo. See, e.g., Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai'i 245, 253, 195 P.3d 1177, 1185 (2008). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
At the time Rarangol committed the offenses in Count 1
 
and 3, HRS § 291E-62(b) (2007) stated:
 
(b) Any person convicted of violating this section
shall be sentenced as follows:
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . .
 
(3) 	For an offense that occurs within five
 
years of two or more prior convictions for
offenses under this section or under
 section 291-4.5 as that section was in
 effect on December 31, 2001:
(A) 	One year imprisonment;
(B) 	A $2,000 fine; and
(C) 	Permanent revocation of the person's
license and privilege to operate a
vehicle.
 
Rarangol contends that HRS § 706-605(3) allows the
 
Circuit Court to impose a suspended sentence for HRS § 291E­
62(b)(3)(C). 
The State counters that the word "shall" in HRS § 291E­
62(b) must be interpreted as mandatory, pointing to the
 
legislative history of HRS § 291-4.5 (2001), the predecessor to
 
HRS § 291E-62, as evidence that the Circuit Court must impose a
 
permanent license revocation. The State also contends that HRS
 
§ 706-605 does not apply because "license suspension is not one
 
of the four dispositions authorized in subsection (1), those
 
being probation, fine, imprisonment and community service, [the]
 
trial court did not err in concluding it was without authority to
 
suspend the permanent driver's license revocation."
 
We agree that, under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3), the Circuit
 
Court must sentence Rarangol to one year of imprisonment, a $2000
 
fine, and permanently revoke Rarangol's license to operate a
 
vehicle. However, the question is whether the Circuit Court can
 
suspend any part of the sentence, pursuant to HRS § 706-605, not
 
whether the Circuit Court has the discretion to deviate from the
 
required sentence under HRS § 291E-62(b)(3). 
HRS § 706-605 states:
 
§706-605 Authorized disposition of convicted
defendants.  (1) Except as provided in parts II and
IV or in section 706-647 and subsections (2), (6), and
(7), and subject to the applicable provisions of this
Code, the court may sentence a convicted defendant to
one or more of the following dispositions:
 (a) 	 To be placed on probation as authorized by
part II;
 
3
  
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(b) To pay a fine as authorized by part III
and section 706-624;
 (c) To be imprisoned for a term as authorizedby part IV; or
 (d) To perform services for the communityunder the supervision of a governmentalagency or benevolent or charitableorganization or other community servicegroup or appropriate supervisor; providedthat the convicted person who performssuch services shall not be deemed to be an employee of the governmental agency orassigned work site for any purpose. All persons sentenced to perform communityservice shall be screened and assessed for appropriate placement by a governmentalagency coordinating public service workplacement as a condition of sentence.
 (2) The court shall not sentence a defendant to 
probation and imprisonment except as authorized by
part II.
 (3) In addition to any disposition authorized in
subsection (1), the court may sentence a person
convicted of a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor to a
suspended sentence.
 (4) The court may sentence a person who has been
convicted of a violation to any disposition authorized
in subsection (1) except imprisonment.
 (5) The court shall sentence a corporation or
unincorporated association that has been convicted of
an offense in accordance with section 706-608.
 (6) The court shall impose a compensation fee
upon every person convicted of a criminal offense
pursuant to section 351-62.6; provided that the court
shall waive the imposition of a compensation fee if it
finds that the defendant is unable to pay the
compensation fee. When a defendant is ordered to make
 payments in addition to the compensation fee, payments
by the defendant shall be made in the following order
of priority:
 (a) Restitution;
 (b) Crime victim compensation fee;
 (c) Probation services fee;
 (d) Other fees; and
 (e) Fines.
 (7) The court shall order the defendant to make
 
restitution for losses as provided in section 706-646. 
4
NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider
the defendant's financial ability to make restitution
in determining the amount of restitution to order.
The court, however, shall consider the defendant's
financial ability to make restitution for the purpose
of establishing the time and manner of payment.
 (8) This chapter does not deprive the court of
any authority conferred by law to decree a forfeiture
of property, suspend or cancel a license, remove a
person from office, or impose any other civil penalty.
Such a judgment or order may be included in the
sentence.
 
In Batson, the issue on appeal was whether the district
 
court erred by suspending 25 days of a minimum 30 day jail
 
sentence for a violation of HRS § 707-712.5 (2001). Batson, 99
 
Hawai'i at 119-20, 53 P.3d at 258-59. At the time, HRS § 707­
712.5 stated in relevant part:
 
Assault against a police officer.  (1) A person
commits the offense of assault against a police
officer if the person:
 
(a) 	Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
causes bodily injury to a police officer
who is engaged in the performance of duty;
 or
 
(b) 	Negligently causes, with a dangerous
instrument, bodily injury to a police
office who is engaged in the performance
of duty.
 
(2) Assault of a police officer is a
misdemeanor. The court shall, at a minimum, sentence
the person who has been convicted of this offense to
imprisonment for no less than thirty days.
 
Id. at 120, 53 P.3d at 259. 
The supreme court in Batson stated:
 
Because a conviction under HRS § 707-712.5 is a
misdemeanor, it is subject to HRS § 706-605. HRS
§ 706-605 sets forth the "Authorized dispositions of
convicted defendants," and provides in relevant part,
"In addition to any disposition authorized in
subsection (1) of this section, the court may sentence
a person convicted of a misdemeanor or petty
misdemeanor to a suspended sentence." HRS § 706­605(3) (1993 & Supp.2000) (emphasis added).
 
A "sentence" is defined as, "The judgement
formally pronounced by the court or judge upon the
defendant after his conviction to be inflicted,
usually in the form of a fine, incarceration, or
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
probation..." Black's Law Dictionary 1362 (6th ed.
1990).
 
Here, the statute does not specifically state
that the convicted "shall serve" the minimum sentence,
nor does the statute explicitly limit the court's
ability to suspend a sentence. The language of the
statute simply states that the court shall "sentence"
the convicted to no less than thirty days
imprisonment. Thus, under a plain meaning analysis,
the sentencing court may sentence Batson to a
suspended sentence.
 
Id. at 121, 53 P.3d at 260. 
The Batson court went on to state that "when the
 
legislature has intended to carve out an exception to HRS § 706­
605, it has been express when doing do." Id. at 121, 53 P.3d at
 
260. The court specifically noted:
 
The legislature has also expressly carved out exceptions in
other sentencing statutes. See HRS § 291E-61(b) (Supp.
2001) ("A person committing the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant shall be
 
sentenced as follows without possibility of probation or
 suspension of sentence . . .")[.]
 
Id. at 122, 53 P.3d at 261. 
In this case, a violation of HRS § 291E-62 is a
 
misdemeanor. See HRS § 701-107. The statute does not contain
 
language that states a defendant "shall serve" a sentence nor
 
does the statute limit the court's ability to suspend the
 
sentence. Therefore, HRS § 706-605 is applicable to HRS § 291E­
62(b). 
Contrary to the State's argument, the legislative
 
history of HRS § 291E-62(b) supports Rarangol's case. Act 189
 
(2000) created HRS §§ 291E-61 and -62 at the same time. As noted
 
in Batson, HRS § 291E-61(b) specified that the sentence was
 
"without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence." 
Id. The legislature did not carve out an exception to HRS § 706­
605 when it failed to include parallel language in HRS § 291E­62(b). 
In 2008, Act 171 modified HRS § 291E-61(b) by removing
 
"without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence,"
 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because the legislature wanted drivers to install ignition
 
interlock devices. In Act 166 of 2010, effective January 1,
 
2011, the legislature again modified HRS Chapter 291E by adding
 
"without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence,"
 
back in to HRS § 291E-61(b). However, this time, Act 166 also
 
added similar language to HRS § 291E-62(b), which now states:
 
(b) Any person convicted of violating this section
shall be sentenced as follows without possibility of
probation or suspension of sentence:
 
Despite the State's claim that "[i]n light of the 2010
 
legislative amendment the trial court has now clearly been
 
divested of the authority to suspend any portion of the sentence
 
mandated by HRS § 291E-62(b)(3)", prior to the effective date of
 
Act 166, the statute did not carve out an exception to HRS § 706­
605. With Act 166, the legislature expressly carved out an
 
exception to HRS § 706-605 to make probation and suspension of
 sentence inapplicable to HRS § 291E-62(b) for violations
 
committed after its effective date. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred by sentencing
 
Rarangol under an erroneous belief that it lacked discretion to
 
suspend the sentence required by HRS § 291E-62(b)(3)(C).

IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Circuit Court's Second Amended Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence, filed on November 10, 2010, is vacated 
2
 This court expresses no opinion on whether it would have been
appropriate to exercise such discretion under the circumstances of this case.
