APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2008-521(WC 08-01))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioners-Appellants/Appellants Home & Community 
Services of Hawaii, Inc., Preferred Home & Community Based 
Services, Inc., and Aloha Habilitation Services, Inc. (the 
Service Providers) appeal from the August 12, 2010 Decision and 
Order (D&O) by the State of Hawai' i Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) dismissing Service Providers' administrative appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
On appeal, the Service Providers contend LIRAB erred
 
when it entered the following orders:
 
(1) The December 19, 2008 order denying the Service 
Providers' motion to stay the October 22, 2008 Declaratory Ruling 
(Declaratory Ruling), issued by the State of Hawai' i Department 
of Labor and Industrial Relations Director (the Director). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2) The August 12, 2010 D&O dismissing the Service
 
Providers' appeal from the Declaratory Ruling for lack of
 
jurisdiction.
 
(3) The November 10, 2010 "Order Denying [the Service
 
Providers'] Motion for Reconsideration."
 
I.
 
The Hawai' i State Department of Human Services (DHS) 
contracted with the Service Providers to provide Medicaid Waiver 
Services to elderly and disabled adults. The Service Providers 
provided these services by subcontracting with various individual 
subcontractors who provided the direct, in-home services. DHS 
paid the Service Providers, who then paid the Medicaid Waiver 
Services subcontractors (subcontractors) for their services. 
In the years 2004-06, the Service Providers obtained
 
workers' compensation insurance for their employees, but not for
 
their subcontractors, based on a belief that the subcontractors
 
were exempt from "employment" under the "domestic exemption"
 
provided under the then-existing Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 386-1(6) (Supp. 2006).1
 
On February 17, 2005, the Director issued a declaratory
 
ruling in In re Manawa Lea Health Services, Inc. (the Manawa Lea
 
Decision), in which he determined the "domestic exemption" did
 
not apply to subcontractors in a similar position with another
 
service provider. After the Manawa Lea Decision was rendered,
 
Intervenor-Appellee/Appellee Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance
 
Company, Inc. (HEMIC) sought unpaid current and back workers'
 
compensation insurance premiums from the Service Providers for
 
their subcontractors for the years 2004-06.

 HRS § 386-1 (Supp. 2006) provided, in pertinent part:
 
. . . .
 
"Employment" does not include the following service:
 
. . . .
 
(6)
 Domestic, which includes attendant care, and day care
services authorized by the department of human services under the
Social Security Act, as amended, performed by an individual in the
employ of a recipient of social service payments[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 13, 2008, the Service Providers petitioned the
 
Director for a declaratory ruling on whether its subcontractors
 
were excluded from "employment" under HRS § 386-1(6) for the
 
years 2004-06.
 
On October 22, 2008, the Director entered his
 
Declaratory Ruling, declaring that the "domestic exemption" under
 
HRS § 386-1(6) only applied to persons who were recipients of
 
social services and social service payments. Because the Service
 
Providers received social service payments, but not social
 
services, the Director ruled that the subcontractors were not
 
excluded from "employment" under HRS § 386-1. The effect of the
 
ruling was that the Service Providers could be liable to HEMIC
 
for unpaid current and back workers' compensation insurance
 
premiums for the subcontractors for the years 2004-06.
 
On November 10, 2008, the Service Providers appealed
 
from the Declaratory Ruling to LIRAB. On November 20, 2008, the
 
Service Providers filed a motion to stay the Declaratory Ruling. 
On December 19, 2008, the LIRAB denied the motion for a stay.
 
On August 12, 2010, LIRAB entered its D&O, dismissing
 
the Service Providers' November 10, 2008 appeal for lack of
 
jurisdiction. On September 1, 2010, the Service Providers moved
 
for LIRAB to reconsider its D&O.
 
On November 10, 2010, LIRAB denied the Service
 
Providers' motion to reconsider LIRAB's D&O. On November 30,
 
2010, the Service Providers filed a notice of appeal to this
 
court from LIRAB's D&O.
 
II.
 
HRS § 91-8 (1993) provides that "[a]ny interested
 
person may petition an agency for a declaratory order as to the
 
applicability of any statutory provision[.]" It is each agency's
 
responsibility to "adopt rules prescribing the form of the
 
petitions and the procedure for their submission, consideration,
 
and prompt disposition." HRS § 91-8. Because "[r]ulings
 
disposing of petitions have the same status as agency decisions
 
or orders in contested cases[,]" declaratory orders under
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 91-8 are appealable pursuant to HRS § 91-14 (1993 & Supp. 
2011) See Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of 
Appeals of City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 114 Hawai' i 184, 199 n.18, 
159 P.3d 143, 158 n.18 (2007) (citation omitted). HRS § 91-14(b) 
provides for judicial review by the circuit court, "except where 
a statute provides for a direct appeal to the intermediate 
appellate court[.]" HRS § 386-73 (Supp. 2011) is just such a 
statute. 
HRS § 386-73 provides that the Director "shall have
 
original jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes arising
 
under [Chapter 386]." HRS § 386-73 further provides that a party
 
may appeal a decision or ruling of the Director "to the appellate
 
board [LIRAB] and thence to the intermediate appellate court[.]" 
HRS § 386-73. 
Therefore, the process provided under HRS § 91-14(b) to
 
appeal to the circuit court from a declaratory ruling is
 
superseded by HRS § 386-73, which provides for a direct appeal to
 
the LIRAB. Ras v. Hasegawa, 53 Haw. 640, 641, 500 P.2d 746, 747
 
(1972); see also Travelers Ins. Co. v. Hawaii Roofing Inc., et
 al., 64 Haw. 380, 384, 641 P.2d 1333, 1336 (1982) ("[T]he
 
legislature has removed the circuit court from the adjudicative
 
process in workers' compensation."). Furthermore, under
 
HRS § 371-4, LIRAB's jurisdiction includes deciding appeals from
 
decisions and orders of the Director "issued under [Chapter
 
386][.]"
 
LIRAB erred when it dismissed the Service Providers'
 
appeal from the Director's October 22, 2008 Declaratory Ruling. 
LIRAB mistakenly described the appeal as one requiring it to
 
determine "the validity of a statute or agency rule;" in other
 
words, LIRAB would need to rule on the constitutionality of
 
HRS § 386-1(6).
 
We recognize that an administrative agency "generally
 
lacks power to pass upon constitutionality of a statute." HOH
 
Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Ind. Licensing Bd., et al., 69 Haw. 135,
 141, 736 P.2d 1271, 1275 (1987). In this case, however, the
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Service Providers did not challenge the constitutionality of
 
HRS § 386-1(6). The Service Provicers merely sought a
 
declaratory ruling on the statute's application to their
 
subcontractors, asking the Director to declare that the
 
subcontractors were independent contractors, not employees, and
 
thereby excluded from "employment" under the "domestic exemption"
 
found in HRS § 386-1(6). The Director undertook an analysis of
 
the statutory construction and legislative history of HRS § 386-1
 
to determine that the subcontractors were not covered by the
 
"domestic exemption." LIRAB was not asked to address the
 
constitutionality of a statute, but instead, was asked to address
 
the Director's analysis of the statute's applicability to the
 
Service Providers. Pursuant to HRS § 386-73, LIRAB had
 
jurisdiction to hear the Service Providers' appeal of the
 
Director's Declaratory Ruling.
 
III.
 
The August 12, 2010 Decision and Order by the State of 
Hawai'i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board is vacated 
and this case is remanded for further proceedings on the merits.
