NO. CAAP-10-0000198
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE SHARON M.Y. YOUNG 
REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 28, 1995
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(TRUST NO. 05-1-0001)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Petitioner-Appellant Mark W.S. Young's
 
(Appellant Young) appeal from the Honorable Derrick H.M. Chan's
 November 10, 2010 "Judgment on Order Denying Beneficiary Mark
 W.S.
 Young's Petition to Remove Trustee" and November 10, 2010 
"Judgment on Order Granting Remainder of Trustee's Petition for Instructions" (Judgments), because the Judgments are not appealable pursuant to Rule 34 of the Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR) 
and Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments,
 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­
1(c). Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of HPR Rule 34 provide the
 manner by which appeals shall be taken:
 
RULE 34.  ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a)
 Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see,
 e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the
 timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with
 the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Michie's Hawaii Revised Statues
 
Annotated Court Rules, HPR Rule 34 cmt. (Michie 2010). "An appeal
 may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a
 judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and
 against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "[A]n appeal from 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does
 not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties
 or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP
 [Rule] 54(b)." Id. Therefore, "an order disposing of a circuit
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate 
judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 
21, 122 P.3d 809, 816 (2005) (citation omitted). "[A] party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer 
v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 
(1994). 
The Judgments do not qualify as appealable judgments
 
under subsections (a), (b) or (c) of HPR Rule 34. The Judgments
 do not belong to the category of judgments resulting directly
 from formal testacy orders, orders of intestacy and determination
 of heirs, orders establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship,
 or orders establishing protective arrangements, as HPR Rule 34(a)
 requires. The Judgments do not contain the necessary express
 finding of "no just reason for delay" in the entry of judgment,
 and, thus, the Judgments are not certified in the manner provided
 by HRCP Rule 54(b), as HPR Rule 34(a) requires for a judgment that
 does not close a probate proceeding. Finally, the Judgments do not
 appear to close this trust proceeding. Absent an appealable
 judgment or an appealable order, this appeal is premature and we
 lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
