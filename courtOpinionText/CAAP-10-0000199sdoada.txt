SANDRA KAY SCHWARTZ, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
LAHAINA DIVISION
 
(DC-S.P. NO. 10-1-0005; CASE NO. 2DTA-08-00292)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Sandra Kay Schwartz ("Schwartz")
 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, filed on November 3,
 2010 ("Order"), in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Lahaina Division ("District Court").
1/
 
On appeal, Schwartz contends that (1) the District
 
Court lacked jurisdiction because the complaint failed to allege
 an essential element of the offense of OVUII, and (2) Wheeler did
 not announce a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Order on the basis explained today in our decision in
 Christian v. State, No. CAAP-11-0000147 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 27,
 2013).
