EDWARD A. SMITH,
Claimant-Appellant 
v. 
SUEJI KANEMOTO,
Employer-Appellee,
 
and
 
FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, INC.,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
  
(CASE NO. AB 2008-423(M)(7-78-00428))
 
ORDER DENYING EMPLOYER-APPELLEE AND
 
INSURANCE CARRIER-APPELLEE’S MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
 
(By: Leonard, J.)
 
Upon consideration of: (1) Employer-Appellee Sueji
 
Kanemoto and Insurance Carrier-Appellee First Insurance Company
 
of Hawaii’s (Appellees) Motion to Dismiss Appeal; (2) Claimant-
Appellant Edward A. Smith’s (Appellant) document filed on 
April 13, 2011, and (3) the records and files herein, it appears
 that: 
1. Appellees are moving to dismiss Appellant’s
 
appeal because Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction and the opening brief; 
2. the statement of jurisdiction and the opening
 
brief are not in default, because the record on appeal was not
 yet filed; 
3. Appellant paid the $175.00 appellate filing fee
 
and costs, but he did not pay the $100.00 agency filing fee to
 
1
; and
 the proper payee 
4. on April 4, 2011, the appellate clerk informed
 
Appellant the record on appeal could not be filed without full
 payment of the filing fee. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to
 
dismiss appeal is denied.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within fifteen days from the
 
date of this order, Appellant shall pay the outstanding $100.00
 filing fee or file a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, that
 is, for waiver of the filing fee. 
Failure to respond to this
 
order may result in dismissal of the appeal. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 24, 2011.
