which this court interprets as a motion for reconsideration of
 
its Summary Disposition Order filed November 22, 2013, the
 memorandum/papers in support of the motion, and the records and
 files in this case, it appears that 
(1) on November 22, 2013, this court filed a Summary
 
Disposition Order affirming the Decision and Order by the Labor
 and Industrial Relations Appeals Board;
