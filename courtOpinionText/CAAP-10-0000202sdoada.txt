APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0260(1))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Philip Valentine (Valentine)
 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's (Circuit
 
1
Court)  November 8, 2010 Judgment, which was entered based on an
order granting summary judgment and awarding sanctions in favor
 
of Defendants-Appellees Socorro Wong, Wilbur C.N. Wong, Stephen
 
Mitsuo Tamashiro, and Penelope Ann Tamashiro (collectively
 
"Appellees") and against Valentine. 
This appeal also encompasses
 
the post-judgment Order Denying Valentine's Motion to Set Aside
 Judgment, filed on January 12, 2011. In this case, Valentine

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
asserts an adverse possession claim against Appellees for
 
portions of the Appellees' land, referred to as Parcel 76 and
 
Parcel 77.
 
In his opening brief, Valentine raises two points of
 
2
error, each with multiple sub-points.  First, Valentine contends
 
that the Circuit Court made fifteen erroneous Findings of Fact
 ("FOF") related to the sanction imposed against Valentine and the
 
summary judgment ruling. Second, Valentine contends that the
 
Circuit Court erred with regard to seven Conclusions of Law
 
("COL") related to the sanction and summary judgment rulings. 
However, the argument section in Valentine's opening
 
brief does not address his points of error.
3 Rather, he argues
 
that "[e]ssentially default was entered" against him and that he
 is entitled to set aside the judgment. Although Valentine's
 
4
opening brief does not comport with HRAP Rule 28,  in our
discretion we address the three discernible issues raised by
 
Valentine in this appeal, that the Circuit Court erred: (1) by
 
granting summary judgment in favor of the Appellees; (2) by
 
granting sanctions to the Appellees; and (3) by denying
 
Valentine's Motion to Set Aside Judgment. 
Upon careful review of the record, the briefs
 
submitted, and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve
 
Valentine's appeal as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court did not err in granting summary
 
judgment in favor of the Appellees.
 
2
 Valentine's Opening Brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b)(4) in that his Points of Error fail to
address the requirement to set forth "where in the record the alleged errorwas objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to theattention of the court[.]"
3
 Specific points of error that are not argued may be deemed waived.
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).

 Valentine's counsel is cautioned to comply with HRAP Rule 28 in the
future.

"An appellate court reviews an award of summary
 
judgment de novo under the same standard applied by the circuit
 
court." Thomas v. Kidani, 126 Hawai' i 125, 127-28, 267 P.3d 
1230, 1232-33 (2011).
 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 
[The court reviews] the evidence in the light most favorable
to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment.
 
Id. at 128, 267 P.3d at 1233 (internal citations omitted); see
 
also Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 56(c). HRCP 
Rule 56(e) requires such a motion to be supported or opposed by
 affidavits made on personal knowledge and
 
shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in
 
evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is
competent to testify to the matters stated therein. . . .
When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as
provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon
the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's
pleading, but the adverse party's response . . . must set
forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue
for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond,
summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against
the adverse party. 
HRCP Rule 56(e) (emphasis added). Thus, once the Appellees­
movants met their initial burden of proof, Valentine, as non­
movant, was obliged to demonstrate the existence of genuine 
issues of material facts. "A fact is material if proof of that 
fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the 
essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by 
the parties." Thomas, 126 Hawai' i at 129, 267 P.3d at 1234. 
Based on our review of the record, including
 
certificates of service and Valentine's own declaration,5
 
Valentine was properly served with the Notice of Hearing on

Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, Appellees' Notice of Hearing for
 
Motion for Summary Judgment, and the Judgment.
 
The Appellees submitted affidavits, declarations,
 
deeds, and maps in support of their motion for summary judgment
 
to affirmatively demonstrate that Valentine did not adversely
 
possess the claimed portions of Parcels 76 and 77. Valentine did
 
not file an opposition memorandum, submit any evidence in
 
opposition to the motion, or appear at the October 19, 2010
 
hearing on the motion, wherein the Circuit Court orally granted
 
summary judgment for the Appellees. 
On October 28, 2010, after the Circuit Court orally
 
granted summary judgment, Valentine submitted an ex parte letter
 
to the Circuit Court, explaining among other things that his
 
absence and refusal to participate in on-going litigation
 
proceedings stemmed from his distrust of both his former counsel
 
and Appellees' counsel.6
 
On November 8, 2010, the Circuit Court entered its
 
order granting summary judgment and sanctions in favor of
 
Appellees, and final judgment in favor of the Appellees. In its
 
November 8, 2010 order, the Circuit Court determined that:
 
(1) summary judgment was warranted in favor of Appellees and
 
(2) Appellees were entitled to sanctions in the amount of $1,500
 
for attorney's fees and costs, for Valentine's failure to appear
 
at his scheduled deposition. 
On November 16, 2010, Valentine filed a Motion to Set
 
Aside Judgment and attached his declaration, in which he
 
explained that he had terminated his prior counsel and he
 
disputed the findings of fact in the Circuit Court's summary
 
judgment and sanction order. The Circuit Court denied this
 
motion on January 12, 2011.

 In this letter, Valentine acknowledged that trial was scheduled for
December 2010, but requested a continuance because he had to find a new
attorney.

With regard to the summary judgment ruling, we conclude 
that Appellees met their initial burden of proof and that 
Valentine did not demonstrate, in turn, genuine issues of 
material fact with regard to his adverse possession claim, and 
therefore Appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
The law of adverse possession is well-settled in Hawai' i and 
requires that the party claiming title carries the burden to prove, "by clear and positive proof, . . . each element of 
actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous and exclusive 
possession for the statutory period." Lai v. Kukahiko, 58 Haw. 
362, 368-69, 569 P.2d 352, 357 (1977); Morinoue v. Roy, 86 Hawai'i 76, 81, 947 P.2d 944, 949 (1997). Moreover, the party 
claiming title "shall show that such person acted in good faith." Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 669-1(b) (1993 Repl.). 
Valentine did not submit anything in response to the summary 
judgment motion and instead his subsequent declaration was filed 
post-judgment as part of his motion to set the judgment aside.
7 
We thus conclude that the Circuit Court correctly granted summary judgment to the Appellees. 
(2) The Circuit Court did not err in granting sanctions to
 
the Appellees for Valentine's failure to appear at his
 
deposition.
 
In addition to granting summary judgment, the Circuit
 
Court ordered sanctions in favor of the Appellees in the amount
 
of $1,500 for attorney's fees and costs due to Valentine's
 
failure to appear at his deposition. Trial in this case was
 
scheduled to commence on December 6, 2010. After Valentine

 As noted by the Circuit Court, even if Valentine's motion to set
aside the judgment were considered a motion for reconsideration under HRCP
Rule 59, there is no basis to conclude that Valentine was precluded fromsubmitting his declaration in a timely fashion to address the summary judgmentmotion. A motion for reconsideration is meant to allow the movant to presentnew evidence or new arguments that could not have been made in the earlierproceeding. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort
Co., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002); Pancakes of Hawaii, Inc. v.
Pomare Props. Corp., 85 Hawai' i 286, 296-97, 944 P.2d 83, 93-94 (App. 1997).

missed his deposition scheduled for August 3, 2010, Appellees
 
filed a motion to compel Valentine's attendance at his deposition
 
under HRCP Rule 37. The Circuit Court filed its order granting
 
the motion on September 14, 2010 and Appellees thereafter again
 
noticed Valentine's deposition, this time scheduled for
 
September 22, 2010. Valentine again failed to appear at the
 
second scheduled deposition. As a result, the Circuit Court
 
granted the Appellees' motion for sanctions.
 
We review these sanctions for abuse of discretion. In 
re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 211, 223, 151 P.3d 692, 
704 (2006). A court abuses its discretion whenever it exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party. Id.

A party's failure to obey a court order to provide 
discovery is expressly subject to sanctions enumerated in HRCP 
Rule 37(b). Aloha Unlimited, Inc. v. Coughlin, 79 Hawai' i 527, 
534, 904 P.2d 541, 548 (App. 1995). The available sanctions under this rule include requiring the disobedient party "to pay 
the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the 
failure[.]" HRCP Rule 37(b)(2) (emphasis added). Valentine 
argues that he did not refuse to participate in discovery and did 
not know his deposition was scheduled. However, the record 
establishes that the Appellees undertook multiple steps in an 
effort to serve and provide notice to Valentine about the 
scheduled depositions and the Circuit Court's order compelling 
his attendance at the September 22 2010 deposition. Valentine 
freely admits that he received but refused to open any 
litigation-related correspondence for a period of time. This 
conscious decision resulted in Valentine's failure to appear at 
his scheduled deposition, in violation of the order granting 
Appellees' motion to compel Valentine's deposition. 
Based on this record, the Circuit Court did not abuse
 
its discretion in awarding sanctions to the Appellees. 
(3) The Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment did not
 
amount to an improper default judgment and the Circuit Court
 
correctly denied Valentine's Motion to Set Aside Judgment.
 
Valentine brought his motion to set aside pursuant to
 
both HRCP Rules 55(c) and 60.
14 Under Rule 55(c), "[f]or good
 
cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a
 judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside
 
in accordance with Rule 60(b)." HRCP Rule 55(c). Under HRCP
 
Rule 60(b)(1), "the court may relieve a party . . . from a final
 
14 Valentine did not specify as to which subsection of HRCP Rule 60 he
brought his motion. However, based upon the arguments asserted, it appears
that Valentine brought his motion under HRCP 60(b)(1).

judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:
 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect[.]"
 
Valentine improperly construes the summary judgment
 
order as akin to a default being entered against him. A default
 
is entered when "a party against whom a judgment for affirmative
 
relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend[.]" 
HRCP Rule 55(a) (emphasis added). In this case, to the contrary,
 
Valentine is the plaintiff who brought the lawsuit and who seeks
 
affirmative relief. The Circuit Court did not issue a default
 
against Valentine, but rather, judgment against Valentine was
 
obtained by summary judgment on the merits. Therefore, there was
 
no basis to set aside the judgment under HRCP Rule 55(c).
 
To the extent Valentine's motion to set aside the 
judgment was based on HRCP Rule 60(b), we review for abuse of 
discretion. Moyle v. Y & Y Hyup Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai' i 385, 
402-03, 191 P.3d 1062, 1079-80 (2008). The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in this regard. In Pogia v. Ramos, 10 Haw. 
App. 411, 876 P.2d 1342 (1994), this court considered whether a 
defendant was entitled to relief from a judgment based on her 
claim that she did not understand what certain court papers 
meant. This court concluded that "[i]gnorance of court rules 
does not constitute excusable neglect" and that "the weight of 
authority has not recognized ignorance of the law . . . to be 
excusable neglect justifying the invocation of relief under HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(1)." Id. at 416, 876 P.2d at 1345; 
see also Citicorp 
Mort., Inc. v. Bartolome,  94 Hawai
'i, 422, 439, 16 P.3d 827, 844 
(App. 2000). Moreover, in addressing the defendant's asserted 
misunderstanding as to what was required of her after being 
served court papers, the Pogia court noted that "'lack of legal 
sophistication . . . cannot form the basis of a claim of 
excusable neglect . . . for purposes of Rule 60(b)' where the 
defendant, after receiving notice, failed to appear or answer." 
10 Haw. App. at 417, 876 P.2d at 1345 (citation omitted).

In this case, Valentine is in a similar position and,
 
moreover, he admits that he received and consciously disregarded
 
litigation-related correspondence and assumed that the case would
 
be continued until he found new counsel. The Circuit Court noted
 
that Valentine "acknowledged receipt of up to eight or nine
 
documents in the mail relating to the ongoing litigation, which
 
he himself started, and admits that he did not open them or read
 
them or attempt to open them and have somebody else explain
 
them." 
Because Valentine fails to demonstrate excusable
 
neglect under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), the Circuit Court correctly
 
denied Valentine's Motion to Set Aside Judgment. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Circuit Court's
 
November 8, 2010 Judgment and January 12, 2011 order denying
 Valentine's motion to set aside judgment are affirmed.
