IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ANTHONY GEOFFREY NEWMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1P110-7632)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Anthony Geoffrey Newman ("Newman")
 
appeals from the November 15, 2010 Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
and/or Order ("Judgment") filed in the District Court of the
 First Circuit, Honolulu Division ("District Court").
1 Newman was
 
convicted of Theft in the Fourth Degree in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ยง 708-833(1) (1993).
2
 
On appeal, Newman contends that the District Court
 
erred in that insufficient evidence existed to support his
 conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment and resolve Newman's point of error as
 follows:
 
1
 The Honorable T. David Woo, Jr. presided.
 
2
 
Theft in the fourth degree. (1) A person commits the
offense of theft in the fourth degree if the person commits
theft of property or services of any value not in excess of
$100.

[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction . . . . The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed, even if it could
be said in a bench trial that the conviction is against the
weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial
evidence to support the requisite findings for conviction,
the trial court will be affirmed.
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). The testimony of a single percipient witness may 
constitute substantial evidence to support a conviction. State 
v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996). 
The testimony of the ABC store manager, Douglas Agliam
 
("Agliam"), constituted substantial evidence in support of the
 State's contention that Newman took the Lipton ice tea bottle
 from the store without permission and without paying for it. 
Although Newman testified that he came into the store with the
 Lipton iced tea in his hand, the District Court's findings
 reflect that the District Court found Agliam's testimony of
 events more credible than Newman's testimony. 
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not 
pass upon issues dependant upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 
697 (1999) (quoting State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 90, 976 P.2d 
399, 404 (1999)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court's 
November 15, 2010 Judgment is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 25, 2011.
