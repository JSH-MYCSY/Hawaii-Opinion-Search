Vorsatz (Vorsatz) and First Hawaiian Bank (FHB) (collectively,
the Trustees), in the Matter of the Thomas H. Gentry Revocable
 
Trust (Trust), T. No. 02-1-0030, for the approval of the Trust's
 
2008 and 2009 accounts, including the Trustees' payment of
 
attorneys' fees and costs to Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal (SNR)
 
and Seyfarth Shaw LLP (Seyfarth) during the 2008 and 2009
 
accounting periods.
 
On appeal, Gentry raises six points of error, arguing
 
that the Probate Court erred with respect to the approval of the
 
Trustees' payments from the Trust to SNR and Seyfarth for
 attorneys' fees and costs. More specially, Gentry contends that
 the subject attorneys' fees and costs: (1) were unreasonable;
 (2) did not conform to local rates for Honolulu attorneys; (3)
 included block-billing and vague and/or ambiguous work
 descriptions; (4) reflected overstaffed representation, which
 included the services of three law firms; (5) did not benefit the
 Trust; and (6) improperly included charges for interstate airline
 travel, ground transportation, costs of meals, unnecessary
 messenger services, and third party conferencing and internet
 services. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we conclude that
 the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in approving the
 Trust's 2008 and 2009 accounts, including the payment of the
 Trustees' attorneys' fees and costs, as reasonable, necessary and
 beneficial to the Trust.
 
As required by Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(11), Gentry has identified related cases, 
including In the Matter of the Thomas H. Gentry Revocable Trust 
and In the Matter of T.H.G. Marital Trusts, Nos. 29727 and 29728

(cons.) (Appeal No. 29727).  As noted by Gentry, Appeal No.
 
29727 involved the same parties as this appeal, and challenged

the Probate Court's approval of Trust accounts with respect to 
the approval of the Trustees' payments from the Trust for attorneys' fees and costs. Appeal No. 29727 concerned the Trust's 2007 accounting period, whereas this appeal concerns the Trust's 2008 and 2009 accounting periods. Nevertheless, the legal determinations made by this court in Appeal No. 29727 are the law of the case. State v Gomes, 107 Hawai' i 253, 258, 112 
P.3d 739, 744 (App. 2005) (citing Jordan v. Hamada, 64 Haw. 446, 450, 643 P.2d 70, 73 (1982) ("'a determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in the course of an action becomes 'the law of the case’ and may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage of litigation,' from which we will not stray." (further citation omitted and format altered)). To the extent that there are identical facts or issues decided in Appeal No. 29727, collateral estoppel may bar their relitigation here. See Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai' i 239, 263­
64, 172 P.3d 983, 1007-08 (2007). Accordingly, we consider Gentry's challenges to the approval of the 2008 and 2009 accounts in light of our ruling on the 2007 accounts. 
First, for the reasons stated in Appeal No. 29727,
 
California law applies to the approval of the Trust's accounts,
 including the attorneys' fees and costs to be paid from the
 Trust.
 
Upon review of the hourly rates charged in conjunction
 
with the 2008 and 2009 accounts, based on the reasoning set forth
 in Appeal No. 29727, we reject Gentry's argument that the hourly
 rates charged by the Trustees' attorneys were unreasonable.
 
Gentry also maintains that the Probate Court erred in 
awarding all of the requested attorneys' fees because the fees were based on time entries that were "block-billed" and which "contained vague and ambiguous work descriptions." Gentry first argues that SNR and Seyfarth should not be compensated from the Trust for "block-billed" entries; however, the case she cites in support of this argument is distinguishable. See generally Haw. 
Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 116 Hawai' i 465, 173 P.3d 1122 
(2007). It merely illustrates that block billing is problematic 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where certain tasks are compensable but others are not. Id. at
 
476-77, 173 P.3d at 1133-34 (block billing rendered it impossible
 
to separate work in scope of receiver's duties, which was
 compensable, from work performed in defense of receiver's fees,
 which was not). In such cases, block-billed entries render it
 
impossible to apportion fees between tasks that are compensable
 
and those that are not. Id. In the present case, though, no
 
delineation is strictly necessary, as all of the tasks concerned
 compensable services performed in the administration of the
 Trust. 
In addition to contesting the block-billed invoices,
 
Gentry argues that SNR and Seyfarth should not be compensated for
 entries with vague and insufficient descriptions of work
 performed. She asserts that entries with notations such as
 "[c]onference call with client and counsels re: various issues,"
 "[r]eview trust accounting," and "[r]evise reply brief" are
 insufficient to support SNR and Seyfarth's fee requests. 
However, Gentry fails to demonstrate that SNR and Seyfarth's
 services did not benefit the Trust or how exactly the Probate
 Court's determination constituted an abuse of discretion. 
California law reveals that a trustee may "use trust funds to pay
 for legal advice regarding trust administration," and here there
 is no indication that SNR and Seyfarth did not benefit the Trust. 
Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court, 22 Cal. 4th 201, 213, 990
 P.2d 591. Furthermore, the record reveals that the Probate Court
 reviewed the invoices and understood the work product performed
 by SNR and Seyfarth, deeming the descriptions to be sufficient
 and the attorneys' fees to be reasonable. Thus, we conclude that
 the Probate Court did not abuse its discretion in approving the
 Trust's accountings for the attorneys' fees, including
 compensation for those entries.
 
Additionally, Gentry argues that the Probate Court
 
erred in retaining SNR and Seyfarth because they were
 "unnecessary and overstaffed the proceedings" (as the Trustees
 were already "represented by prominent Honolulu and California
 trust/estate law firms"). In support of this contention, Gentry
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
refers to the case of Donahue v. Donahue, 105 Cal. Rptr. 3d 723
 
(2010), where a trust beneficiary challenged the trustee's
 petition for more than $5 million in attorneys' fees incurred
 while defending a final accounting that involved allegations of
 breach of trust. Id. at 726. The trustee had been represented
 
by multiple attorneys from three large firms, several of whom
 billed at rates as high as $690 per hour. Id. at 726-27. 
Upon review, the court in Donahue set forth several
 
factors for a court to consider when examining reasonableness
 with regard to overstaffing and unnecessary services. First, it
 must engage in careful review of the supporting documentation to
 avoid an overly deferential approach. Id. at 731-32. The court
 
should consider "whether the case was overstaffed, how much time
 the attorneys spent on particular claims, and whether the hours
 were reasonably expended." Id. at 732 (citations and internal
 
quotation marks omitted). It must exclude compensation for
 "padding in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts." Id.
 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It must
 consider whether the fees incurred are "proportional to the
 trust's objectives." Id. at 734. Finally, it must determine
 
whether the fees were "reasonably incurred for the benefit of the
 trust." Id. at 735. The overarching standard is based upon the
 
time spent and the "reasonable value of that time[.]" Id. at 732
 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
In the present case, the Probate Court found credible
 
SNR and Seyfarth's explanations for the reasonableness and
 necessity of the fees, and it personally reviewed the unredacted
 invoices before rendering a decision. The court also took into
 account each of the factors set forth in Donahue. It carefully
 considered and rejected Gentry's claims that the Trustees had
 overstaffed the case, that the amount of time spent was
 unreasonable, and that the invoices were somehow "padded." 
Donahue, 105 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 732. The record amply reflects
 that, during the 2008 and 2009 accountings, there were numerous
 objections/responses to the Trustees' petitions, and the Trustees
 were obligated to respond to these opposing assertions. Also,
 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
there was no indication that the fees incurred were not
 
proportional to the Trust's objectives or that the work done did
 not benefit the Trust. Thus, the Probate Court's determination
 regarding the allegation of overstaffing was in accord with
 California law, and no abuse of discretion occurred.
 
Finally, Gentry asserts that the Probate Court erred
 
when it approved the Trustees' payment to SNR and Seyfarth for
 their requested costs included in the 2008 and 2009 accounting
 periods, which included costs for "interstate airline travel,
 ground transportation, costs of meals, unnecessary messenger
 services, and third party conferencing and internet services."
 We have reviewed the Probate Court's approval of the Trustees'
 payment from Trust assets for costs in the amount of $2,740.58 in
 2008, and $255.50 in 2009, and conclude that Gentry's arguments
 are without merit. See also Appeal No. 29727.
 
For these reasons, the Probate Court's Judgment on 2008
 
Accounts and Judgment on 2009 Accounts, both filed on November 9,
 2010, are affirmed.
