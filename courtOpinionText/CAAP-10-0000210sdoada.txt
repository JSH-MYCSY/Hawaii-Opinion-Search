Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we conclude that
 
the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in approving the
 
Marital Trust's 2008 and 2009 accounts, including the payment of
 
the Trustees' attorneys' fees and costs, as reasonable, necessary
 
and beneficial to the Marital Trust.
 
We begin with the proposition that this court's 
decisions in the related cases, In the Matter of the Thomas H. 
Gentry Revocable Trust and In the Matter of T.H.G. Marital 
Trusts, Nos. 29727 and 29728, 2013 WL 376083 at *1, (App. 
Jan. 31, 2013) (mem.) (hereinafter referred to as "No. 29727") 
and In the Matter of the Thomas H. Gentry Revocable Trust, CAAP­
10-0000208, 2013 WL 6043903 at *1, (App. Nov. 15, 2013) (SDO) 
(hereinafter referred to as "CAAP-10-0000208") are law of the 
case. State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai 'i 253, 258, 112 P.3d 739, 744 
(App. 2005) and to the extent that there are identical facts or issues decided in No. 29727 and CAAP-10-0000208, collateral 
estoppel may also bar their relitigation here. See Omerod v. 
Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai
'i 239, 263–64, 172 P.3d 983, 
1007–08 (2007); see also CAAP-10-0000208 at *1. Therefore, we 
consider Gentry's challenges to the approval of the 2008 and 2009 
accounts in light of our ruling on the 2007 accounts and our 
ruling in CAAP-10-0000208 that addressed Gentry's challenge to 
the 2008 and 2009 accounts with regard to the Revocable Trust. 
Id. 
First, following the reasoning stated in Appeal No.
 
29727 and CAAP-10-0000208, California law applies to the approval
 
of the Marital Trust's accounts, which include the attorneys'
 
fees and costs to be paid from the Marital Trust. There were no

 During the course of the litigation, the principal attorney
representing the Co-Trustees, Alan Yoshitake, moved from SNR to Seyfarth.
Trustees were also represented by other firms, whose billing is not challenged
on appeal.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and costs for Seyfarth included in either the
 
2008 or 2009 petitions for the Marital Trust. Therefore, we
 
address Gentry's arguments only as to SNR.
 
Gentry argues that the Circuit Court erred in approving 
attorneys' fees "without offering any explanation for the 
approval." To the extent Gentry is challenging the authority for 
the award of attorneys' fees and costs, as implied by her 
citation to City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Hsiung, 109 Hawai 'i 159, 
179, 124 P.3d 434, 454 (2005), we reject the argument as meritless in light of our decision in No. 29727 at *10 citing to 
In re Griffith's Estate, 218 P.2d 149, 153 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 
1950) ("A trustee is entitled to employ counsel and be reimbursed 
from the funds of the trust for reasonable sums paid for the 
services of such counsel whenever it is necessary to the proper 
administration, preservation or execution of the trust.") 
Next, based on the reasoning in No. 29727 and in CAAP­
10-0000208, "we reject Gentry's argument that the hourly rates
 
charged by the Trustees' attorneys were unreasonable." CAAP-10­
0000208 at *2.
 
Gentry also argues that SNR's "inadequate, excessive 
and block-billed invoices require reversal[.]" This argument 
maintains that because the billing invoices were deficient, they 
cannot support the Circuit Court's determination of 
reasonableness. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 116 Hawai
'i 
465, 476-77, 173 P.3d 1122, 1133-34 (2007) (hereinafter referred to as "Hawaii Ventures II"), cited by Gentry, is distinguishable. 
There, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court did not hold that block-billing 
in itself was impermissible. Rather, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court's 
holding "merely illustrates that block billing is problematic 
where certain tasks are compensable but others are not." CAAP­
10-0000208 at *2 (citing Hawaii Ventures II, 116 Hawai 'i at 476­
77, 173 P.3d 1133-34). Gentry does not argue that any of the tasks described in the billing were not compensable. 
Gentry also argues that SNR's "invoices are replete
 
with ambiguous work descriptions[,]" which "makes it difficult,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
if not impossible to determine if the work performed . . .
 
benefited the Marital Trusts." The parties do not disagree that
 
"attorney's fees and expenses incurred in a trust litigation is
 
properly payable out of estate funds where the litigation is for
 
the benefit of the estate." Midkiff v. Kobayashi, 54 Haw. 299,
 
338, 507 P.2d 724, 746 (1973). California law similarly allows
 
for the use of trust funds "to pay for legal advice regarding
 
trust administration[.]" Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court, 990
 
P.2d 591, 599 (Cal. 2000). In addition, California courts have
 determined that "[p]reparing the accounting and responding to the
 
beneficiaries' objections to that accounting are aspects of trust
 
administration." Kasperbauer v. Fairfield, 88 Cal. Rptr. 3d 494,
 
499 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009).
 
However, under California law, "[d]etailed invoices are
 
not required to support a fee determination so long as there is
 sufficient documentary evidence on which the court may base its
 
conclusion." No. 29727 at *13 (citing PLCM Grp., Inc. v.
 
Drexler, 997 P.2d 511, 519 (Cal. 2000)). The invoices submitted
 
provided the requisite documentary evidence and the minute orders
 
indicate that the Circuit Court reviewed the unredacted invoices
 
before approving these fees. It was not an abuse of the Circuit
 
Court's discretion to rely on those invoices and to award the
 
requested fees.
 
Next, Gentry argues that the work done by SNR was 
duplicative or unnecessary due to the representation by other 
outside counsel. Gentry argues that "the Co-Trustees had 
overstaffed their representation with three different law 
firms[,]" and that the credentials of the previous representation 
negated any need "to have high-priced Mainland attorneys because 
of inadequate representation in Hawai
'i." 
However, Gentry provides no specifics to support her
 
argument and does not claim that the work performed by SNR was in
 
any manner redundant or duplicative of the work performed by
 
other counsel. In light of the numerous objections and responses
 
to the Trustees' petitions, the Trustees' responses, as well as
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
submission of the unredacted invoices submitted by SNR in this
 
record, there is no support for Gentry's claim.
 
Similarly, there is no indication that any of the fees
 
incurred were not for work that benefitted the Marital Trust or
 
that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in approving the
 
requested fees after its review of the invoices. California
 
courts have determined that "[p]reparing the accounting and
 
responding to the beneficiaries' objections to that accounting
 
are aspects of trust administration." Kasperbauer, 88 Cal. Rptr.
 
3d at 499.
 
Finally, citing to Hawai 'i case authority, Gentry 
argues that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in awarding compensation for costs related to messenger services.
4 However, 
we have held previously in No. 29727 that "HRS § 607-9 and related Hawai
'i cases . . . do not apply to the approval of the 
trusts' accounts here." No. 29727 at *17. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's November 9, 2010 Judgments approving the accounts
 for the calendar years of 2008 and 2009 are affirmed.
