IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM LOEBEL, IV, Defendant-Appellant

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(CR. NO. 09-1-0587)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant William Loebel, IV (Loebel) appeals

from the November 17, 2010, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law

and Freestanding Order of Restitution (November 17, 2010

Restitution Order), entered by the Circuit Court of the First

1
Circuit (Circuit Court),  ordering Loebel to pay $20,256.48 in 
restitution to the State of Hawai
'i Department of Human Services 
(DHS) pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-646. 
On appeal, Loebel contends that the Circuit Court erred

in granting the November 17, 2010 Restitution Order because DHS

does not qualify as a "victim" under HRS § 706-646(1). 
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the

parties and having given due consideration to the arguments

advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve

Loebel's point of error as follows:

1

The Honorable Steven S. Alm presided.

 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 706-646 (Supp. 2011) provides, in relevant part:

§ 706-646 Victim Restitution.  (1) As used in this
section, 'victim' includes any of the following:

(a) 	 The direct victim of a crime including a business
entity, trust or governmental entity;

. . . .

(c) 	 
A governmental entity which has reimbursed the victim
for losses arising as a result of the crime.

(2) The court shall order the defendant to make

restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant's offense

when requested by the victim. . . . 
 
(3) . . . Restitution shall be a dollar amount that

is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses,
including but not limited to:

. . . .

(b)		Medical expenses; . . .

In State v. Murray, 63 Haw. 12, 621 P.2d 334 (1980),
 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court addressed the issue of "whether a 
sentencing court may compel a defendant to repay medical expenses

incurred by the State of Hawaii on behalf of a direct victim of a

crime[.]" 63 Haw. at 13, 621 at 336. The supreme court found
 
that the determination that the State was a "victim" was

consistent with a legislative contemplation that the
provision in question should serve several objectives,
including retribution, rehabilitation, and restitution. In

our opinion, the State was for all practical purposes a
victim of the crime. It was obligated to assume the
financial burden of defendant's misdeed since the direct

victim was a fellow prisoner. 
 
Id. at 20, 621 P.2d at 339-40 (emphasis added).

2
Although Murray  was grounded in HRS § 706-605, this 
court, in 
State v. Sequeira, subsequently noted that HRS § 706­
646(1)(c) "essentially codifies the Hawai' i Supreme Court's 
decision in State v. Murray . . . that a governmental entity may 
qualify for an award of restitution if it has reimbursed the 
'direct victim' of a crime for certain damages or losses incurred 
2

In 1998, HRS § 706-605 was amended by adding references to two new
statutory sections, including HRS § 706-646. See 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act

269, §§ 1, 4 at 911-12.

as a result of the crime." 93 Hawai' i 34, 40 n.7, 995 P.2d 335, 
341 n.7 (2000). 
Here, because the direct victim was indigent, DHS was

obligated, through the State's Medicaid program, to assume the

financial obligation of Loebel's criminal misconduct. Based on

the supreme court's decision in Murray, as later codified in HRS

§ 706-646(3), DHS is a victim entitled to restitution.

We reject Loebel's argument that this court's decision 
in State v. Tuialii, 121 Hawai' i 135, 214 P.3d 1125 (App. 2009), 
supports his position. In Tuialii, we stated that an insurer was not the "direct victim" under HRS § 706-646(1), holding that 
restitution under HRS § 706-646(1) was to be paid to the direct 
victim, not its insurer. Id. at 140, 214 P.3d at 1130. The 
issue in that case, however, involved the application of HRS § 
706-646(1)(a). HRS § 706-646(1)(a) is not at issue in this case; 
rather, it is HRS § 706-646(1)(c) that support the restitution 
order herein. 
We also reject Loebel's argument that the Circuit Court

incorporated civil subrogation principles into its criminal

restitution order. The Circuit Court properly grounded its

decision in HRS § 707-646, not civil subrogation principles.

For these reasons, the Circuit Court's November 17,

2010 Restitution Order is affirmed.
