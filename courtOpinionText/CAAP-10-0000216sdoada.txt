STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ALFREDO ADRIANO BAUTISTA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0495(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Alfredo Bautista (Bautista) timely
 
appeals from the November 17, 2010 judgment entered by the
 
1
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court),  convicting
him of two counts of assault in the third degree in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-712(1)(a) (1993).2
 
Bautista asserts three points of error, asking this
 
court to overturn his convictions and remand his case to the
 
trial court with instructions to take no further action. First,
 
he argues the circuit court abused its discretion when it denied
 
the deputy public defender and Bautista's repeated requests to
 
permit the deputy public defender to withdraw as counsel and to

 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided.

 In relevant part, HRS § 707-712 provides, "A person commits the
offense of assault in the third degree if the person . . . intentionally,
knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another person." HRS § 707­712(1)(a).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
have substitute counsel appointed. Second, Bautista contends
 
that the circuit court committed reversible error when it found
 
Bautista fit to proceed. Third, he argues that the circuit court
 
committed reversible error when it gave Jury Instruction No. 22,
 
which omitted a crucial word in its explanation of "mutual
 
affray," thus materially changing the meaning of the instruction
 
and making the verdict erroneous.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Bautista's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) Although a criminal defendant has a right to 
effective assistance of counsel, it is not absolute. State v. 
Torres, 54 Haw. 502, 504, 510 P.2d 494, 496 (1973) (citing U.S. Const. amend. VI and amend. XIV, Haw. Const. art. 1, § 11 ). 
"[C]ertain restraints must be put on the reassignment of counsel 
lest the right be manipulated so as to obstruct the orderly 
procedure in the courts or to interfere with the fair 
administration of justice." State v. Soares, 81 Hawai' i 332, 
354, 916 P.2d 1233, 1255 (App. 1996) (quoting McKee v. Harris, 649 F.2d 927, 931 (2d Cir. 1981) (internal quotation marks 
omitted)), overruled on other grounds by State v. Janto, 92 
Hawai'i 19, 986 P.2d 306 (1999). Thus, a trial court's decision 
will only be overturned on appeal if "there was an abuse of discretion that prejudiced the defendant by amounting to an 
unconstitutional denial of the right to effective assistance of 
counsel." Torres, 54 Haw. at 505, 510 P.2d at 496. This court 
looks to whether the circuit court protected Bautista's right to effective representation of counsel by conducting an inquiry that 
was "sufficient to enable the court to determine if there is good 
cause to warrant substitution of counsel." State v. Kossman, 101 
Hawai'i 112, 119, 63 P.3d 420, 427 (App. 2003) (citation 
omitted). 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In assessing whether there was good cause, the circuit 
court may not simply consider the defendant's subjective 
perception but must apply an objective standard. Id. at 120, 63 
P.3d at 428. "The law is clear in this jurisdiction that the appellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate court with a 
sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." Union 
Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984); see also Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 
Hawai'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995). See State v. Hoang, 
93 Hawai' i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) (applying the burden 
in a criminal case). 
Here, the foundation is unclear for Bautista's
 
assertion. Bautista notes that the circuit court held a hearing
 
on the deputy public defender's first motion to withdraw and, at
 
this hearing held on November 10, 2009, denied the motion. He
 
also cites the transcripts of August 5, 2010, in which the
 
circuit court appointed substitute counsel, and of trial
 
proceedings held on June 23, 2010, in which the deputy public
 
defender asserted the defense that Bautista lacked penal
 
responsibility even though Bautista specifically stated that he
 
did not want to assert that defense. No transcript for the
 
November 10, 2009 or June 23, 2010 hearings is in the record. 
Thus, Bautista provides an insufficient record for this court to
 
review these aspects of his argument because, without the
 
transcripts, this court has no basis upon which it might (1)
 
review the circuit court's inquiry and reasoning with regard to
 
the first motion and (2) fully assess the events of June 23,
 
2010.
 
In support of his challenge to the circuit court's
 
denial of his second motion to substitute counsel, Bautista did
 
provide this court with his May 19, 2010 letter to the circuit
 
court requesting new counsel, the deputy public defender's second
 
motion to withdraw, and transcript of the circuit court's hearing
 
on the same where the circuit court denied the motion. Bautista
 
argues that a complete breakdown of trust and confidence occurred
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
between the deputy public defender and him. Bautista, however,
 
does not provide any authorities that support his argument that
 
the circuit court abused its discretion by determining that
 
Bautista was not being denied effective assistance of counsel by
 
his attorney's conduct and our review reveals that the circuit
 
court's decision is supported by what is in the record.
 
Additionally, the circuit court's determination is 
consistent with the case law from this jurisdiction. See 
Kossman, 101 Hawai' i at 120-21, 63 P.3d at 428-29; see also State 
v. Alston, 120 Hawai' i 254, 203 P.3d 674, No. 28410 2009 WL 
868034 at *13 (App. Mar. 31, 2009) (mem.); State v. Yagin, 125 Hawai'i 243, 257 P.3d 1220, No. 29843 2011 WL 576586 * 1 (App. 
Feb. 17, 2011) (SDO). To be entitled to relief, Bautista cannot just conclusorily assert that there was a breakdown in trust, he 
must show that there was either a disqualifying conflict of 
interest or an apparently unjust verdict. Kossman, 101 Hawai' i 
at 121, 63 P.3d at 429. Bautista does not do either. We therefore reject Bautista's first issue on appeal. 
(2) In deciding whether Bautista was fit to proceed to
 
3
trial,  the circuit court was required to assess the medical
3
 It is unclear to what end Bautista challenges the circuit court's
determination that he was fit to proceed. Except for claims reserved for
appeal in a conditional plea, a defendant waives the right to assertnonjurisdictional claims by knowingly and voluntarily entering a guilty or nocontest plea. Adams v. State, 103 Hawai' i 214, 225-26, 81 P.3d 394, 405-06
(2003); State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162-63, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318-19 (1990).This bars the arguments raised in Bautista's opening brief as to Count One,which do not explicitly attack the validity of the plea. While Bautista questions the validity of the plea in his reply brief, an argument not raisedin the opening brief cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief.See State v. Mark, 123 Hawai' i 205, 230, 231 P.3d 478, 503 (2010); Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(d) ("The reply brief shall be confined tomatters presented in the answering brief."). 
On the other hand, even where the appellant does not contest the
validity of his guilty plea on appeal, the court may address this issue under
the plain-error standard. See State v. Vaitogi, 59 Haw. 592, 6593 n.4, 585
 
P.2d 1259, 1260 n.4 (1978). "It is axiomatic that an accused must be
 competent to enter a valid guilty plea." United States v. Masthers, 539 F.2d
 
721, 725 (D.C. Cir. 1976). Here, Bautista argues that he was not fit to
proceed. Accordingly, the circuit court could interpret this point of error
as encompassing an attack on the validity of his plea. We decline to do so. 
Bautista does not actually link his fitness argument with his attack on the
validity of the plea. He does not ask to withdraw his plea, seeking a
(continued...)

evidence and its observation of the defendant to determine 
whether Bautista either (1) lacked the capacity to understand the 
proceedings against him or (2) lacked the capacity to assist in 
his defense. State v. Castro, 93 Hawai' i 424, 426 n.1, 5 P.3d 
414, 416 n.1 (2000); HRS § 704-403 (1993). 
With regard to his first motion, Bautista argues that 
the circuit court erred in its assessment of the medical evidence presented at the April 9, 2010 fitness hearing and recounts the 
subsequent trial proceedings. However, this invitation to re­
weigh the evidence does not comport with the applicable standard 
of review. The case law from this jurisdiction has overruled the 
trial court's determination only when the trial court either 
failed to comply with the statutorily-required procedures or 
chose to rely on its own observations in the absence of a 
complete medical report. See Castro, 93 Hawai' i at 427, 5 P.3d 
at 417; State v. Tierney, 127 Hawai' i 157, 168-72, 277 P.3d 251, 
262-66 (2012). Accordingly, this court rejects Bautista's 
challenge to the circuit court's denial of his first motion to be 
found unfit to proceed. 
With regard to his renewed request, Bautista relies on
 
testimony from trial proceedings that took place on June 22,
 
2010, June 23, 2010, and June 24, 2010, for which no transcripts
 
appear in the record. Here, the transcripts are necessary for
 
any meaningful review of the circuit court's denial of the
 
renewed request. Therefore, Bautista has failed to present a
 
sufficient record to review his claim.
 
(3) Bautista argues that the circuit court committed
 
reversible error when it gave Jury Instruction No. 22, which set
 
3(...continued)
dismissal instead. This suggests that Bautista actually is seeking a partial
withdrawal or modification of a plea agreement, which is not obviouslypermissible. See Adams, 103 Hawai' i at 225-26, 81 P.3d at 405-06 (noting that
Adams cited no authority pursuant to which this court may permit a partialwithdrawal or modification of a plea agreement but declining to reach theissue as unnecessary for the disposition of the appeal). Moreover, this courtwould have to find that the circuit court plainly erred in its ruling as toBautista's fitness to proceed and as is next discussed, no reversible errorappears in the record provided.

forth the mitigating mutual affray defense but omitted the word 
"not" and, thus, changed the meaning of the instruction to its 
opposite. "Mutual affray" is a mitigating defense to the offense 
of misdemeanor assault in the third degree. State v. Kikuta, 125 
Hawai'i 78, 95, 253 P.3d 639, 656 (2011). If the fight or 
scuffle was entered into by mutual consent, the offense becomes a 
petty misdemeanor. Id.; see also HRS § 707-712(2). In Kikuta, 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the circuit court erred where 
it did not give a mutual affray instruction because there was 
some evidence that the fight or scuffle had been entered into by 
mutual consent. Id. at 96, 253 P.3d at 657. The court in Kikuta 
further observed that the Hawai' i Jury Instructions Criminal 
requires this instruction when there is evidence in the record 
that supports it. Id. at 97-98, 253 P.3d at 658-59 (referencing 
HAWJIC 9.21). 
In this case, the written instruction stated:
 
With respect to Count Two of the charging document, if you
find that the prosecution has proven the offense of Assault
in the Third Degree beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must
also determine whether the prosecution has proven beyond a
reasonable doubt that Defendant entered into a fight or
scuffle by mutual consent. This determination must be
unanimous and is to be indicated by answering "Yes" or "No"
on a special interrogatory which will be provided to you. 
Did the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a
fight or scuffle between Defendant and Andrian Rodriguez was
entered into by mutual consent? [Your answer must be
unanimous].
 
Bautista explains that the instruction omits the word
 
"not" in both paragraphs, arguing that the prosecution was
 
required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a fight or
 
scuffle between Bautista and Andrian Rodriguez was not entered
 
into by mutual consent. Bautista further asserts that the trial
 
court's clerk read the jury verdict form with that error and
 
references a missing transcript. Bautista then argues that the
 
circuit court found that evidence adduced at trial was sufficient
 
to require the mutual affray defense. Bautista further contends
 
that, having demonstrated instructional error, there was a
 
reasonable possibility that the error contributed to his
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
conviction and, thus, the error was not harmless beyond a
 
reasonable doubt and the judgment must be vacated.
 
While here, as the State conceded, there was an 
instructional error, the particular circumstances in this case 
involve an absent – as opposed to silent – record. Cf. Parke v. 
Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 30 (1992) (noting the difference between cases in which an extant transcript is suspiciously silent and 
those in which no transcript exists, applying the presumption of 
regularity in the latter). Moreover, the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
has explained that "[instructional] error is not to be viewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract" but "must be 
examined in the light of the entire proceedings and given the 
effect which the whole record shows it to be entitled." State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006). Thus, 
this court must have a sufficient record to place the 
instructional error in its context, including whether evidence 
going to the mutual affray defense was adduced at trial. See 
id.; Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i at 95-98, 253 P.3d at 656-59. 
Accordingly, the court cannot reach the merits of this alleged 
error. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 17, 2010 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed, without prejudice to a subsequent petition pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40.
