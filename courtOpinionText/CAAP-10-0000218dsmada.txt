KAILUA 50, LLC, and SARA D. WARREN,
Individually and as the Independent Executor of the

Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v. 
MOKUPUNI TELEVISION CO., LLC,
MOKUPUNI TELEVISION CO., INC., and
KAILUA TELEVISION, LLC, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-1878)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiffs-Appellants
 
Kailua 50, LLC (Appellant Kailua 50), and Sara D. Warren
 (Appellant Warren) have asserted from the Honorable Rom A.
 Trader's November 17, 2010 "Order Denying Plaintiffs' 'Motion to
 Reinstate and/or Set Aside Order of Dismissal (Inactivity) Filed
 September 1, 2010' Filed on October 6, 2010" (the November 17,
 2010 order denying the motion to set aside the September 1, 2010
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissal order) because the circuit court has not yet entered a 
separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in this case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has promulgated HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). The separate 
judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a 
judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 
P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of 
Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation 
omitted; emphasis added).

On February 8, 2011, the record on appeal for Appeal 
No. CAAP-10-0000218 was filed, at which time the record on appeal 
did not contain a separate judgment on all claims in the instant case. Although the record on appeal contains the circuit court's September 1, 2010 "Order of Dismissal" due to inactivity, the supreme court has specifically explained that such a dismissal order is not independently appealable because, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. 
Obayashi Hawaii Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 
1369 (1996) (emphases added). 
Granted, Appellant Kailua 50 and Appellant Warren are 
attempting to appeal from the November 17, 2010 order denying the motion to set aside the September 1, 2010 dismissal order, and "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 
157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
However, in the instant case, the circuit court has not 
yet entered a "judgment," and "[a] Rule 60(b), HRCP, motion is authorized only in situations involving final judgments." Crown 
Properties, Inc. v. Financial Security Life Insurance Co., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985). The Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure define the word "judgment" as "a decree and any order from which an appeal lies." HRCP Rule 54(a) (emphasis 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
added); see also Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i 373, 382, 168 P.3d 17, 
26 (2007); Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Conchran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 
262, 799 P.2d 60, 65 (1990). 
As explained above, the September 1, 2010 dismissal 
order is not in the nature of a judgment because the September 1, 
2010 dismissal order is not an "order from which an appeal lies." HRCP Rule 54(a); see Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corporation, 81 Hawai'i at 176, 914 P.2d at 1369. The circuit court has not yet 
reduced the September 1, 2010 dismissal order to a separate judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 58. Consequently, the subsequent November 17, 2010 order denying the motion to set aside the September 1, 2010 dismissal order is not an appealable post-judgment order, but, instead, it is an interlocutory order that will be eligible for appellate review when and if the circuit court enters an appealable final judgment and a party asserts a timely appeal from that appealable final judgment. Absent a separate, appealable, final judgment, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP­
10-0000218 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
