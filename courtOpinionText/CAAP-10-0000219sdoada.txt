LANCE PAUL LARSEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(North & South Hilo Division)
(Case No. 3DTA-08-03139)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lance Paul Larsen (Larsen) appeals
 
from the Judgment filed on November 15, 2010, in the District
 
Court of the Third Circuit (District Court).1 Larsen was charged
 
with failure to appear in answer to a citation, in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 803-6(e) (Supp. 2011). Larsen
 filed a motion to dismiss the charge asserting that he is "a
 subject of the Hawaiian Kingdom" and therefore the District Court
 lacked jurisdiction over his case. The District Court denied the
 motion to dismiss, and Larsen entered a conditional no contest
 plea to the charge. The District Court sentenced Larsen to two
 days of imprisonment, with credit for time served. 
On appeal, Larsen argues that the District Court lacked 
jurisdiction over his case because he is a "Hawaiian national" and a subject of the Kingdom of Hawai' i. We conclude that

Larsen's argument lacks merit and that the District Court 
properly denied his motion to dismiss. See HRS § 701–106 (1993); 
State v. Ferqerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 
2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). 
We affirm the Judgment of the District Court.
