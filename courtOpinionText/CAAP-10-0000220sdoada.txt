STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
HOUNES H. WAGNER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-03779)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Hounes H. Wagner (Wagner) appeals
 
from the Honolulu Division of the District Court of the First
 
Circuit's (District Court) Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or
 
Order and Plea/Judgment (Judgment), filed on December 6, 2010.1
 
Following a bench trial, Wagner was found guilty of Operating a
 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2010), had his license
 
revoked for 90 days, was required to pay various fines and fees,
 
and was referred to an alcohol assessment program. This timely
 
appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Wagner raises two points of error:
 (1) The District Court erred when it denied Wagner's
 
motion to dismiss in which he argued that the court lacked

subject matter jurisdiction to convict Wagner pursuant to HRS
 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) because the oral charge failed to allege the
 
requisite mens rea; and
 
(2) there was no substantial evidence to prove that
 
Wagner was under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient
 
to impair his normal mental faculties or ability to care for
 
himself and guard against casualty.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Wagner's points of error as follows:
 
(1) In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617 
(2012), the Hawai' i Supreme Court held, inter alia, that mens rea 
must be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and 
cause of the accusation. Accordingly, the District Court erred 
in concluding that mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS § 
291E–61(a)(1) charge and Wagner's HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) charge was 
deficient for failing to allege mens rea. 
(2) We reject Wagner's contention that there was 
insufficient evidence to support a conviction. Based on Officer 
Ho's testimony concerning his observation of Wagner's driving and 
the "really strong odor of an alcoholic type beverage" on Wagner, 
there was sufficient evidence to support Wagner's conviction. We 
presume that the District Court was not influenced by incompetent 
evidence (see State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai' i 288, 298, 983 P.2d 189, 
199 (1999)) and, here, the District Court expressly acknowledged that there was no evidence introduced as to Wagner's blood-
alcohol content.

For these reasons, it is hereby ordered that the
 
District Court's December 6, 2010 Judgment is vacated and the
 
matter is remanded for dismissal of the charge without prejudice.
