IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
BRYAN K.A. MULLER, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0879)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley and Ginoza, JJ. with Nakamura, C.J. dissenting)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bryan K.A. Muller (Muller) appeals
 
from a Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence filed on
 
November 16, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (circuit court).
1 Judgment was entered against Muller on Count
 
2
II for Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2012).3
 
1 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided.
 
2 The indictment charged Muller with three Counts: Sexual Assault in
the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(b)
(Supp. 2012) (Count I); Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of
HRS § 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2012) (Count II); and Sexual Assault in the Third
Degree in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(b) (Count III). Muller was found not
 guilty on Counts I and III. 
HRS § 707-732(1)(b) provides in pertinent part:
 
§707-732 Sexual assault in the third degree.  (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the third
degree if:
. . .
 
(b)	 The person knowingly subjects to sexual contact
another person who is less than fourteen years old or
causes such a person to have sexual contact with the
person[.]

On appeal, Muller contends: (1) the circuit court erred
 
in not dismissing Count II for lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction because the indictment failed to allege an essential
 element of the charge; (2) the prosecution invaded the province
 of the grand jury; (3) the circuit court erroneously excluded
 relevant evidence; (4) the circuit court erred by not granting
 Muller's motions for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient
 evidence; (5) the circuit court erred in its instructions to the
 jury; (6) the statutory definition of sexual contact is vague as
 applied in this case; and (7) errors not raised by trial counsel
 may have constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Muller's
 points of error as follows:
 
Count II of the indictment against Muller states in
 
relevant part:
 
COUNT II: On or about the 1st day of October, 2008, to
and including the 24rd [sic] day of December, 2008, in the
City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, BRYAN K.A.
MULLER did knowingly subject to sexual contact, [complaining
witness], who was less than fourteen years old or did cause
[complaining witness] to have sexual contact with BRYAN K.A.
MULLER, by inserting his tongue in her mouth, thereby
committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree
in violation of Section 707-732(1)(b) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes.
 
During the trial court proceedings, Muller did not 
challenge the sufficiency of the indictment. Where the appellant 
alleges a charge is defective for the first time on appeal, an appellate court must "liberally construe the indictment in favor of validity[.]" State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 93, 657 P.2d 1019, 
1021 (1983); see also State v. Wells, 78 Hawai
'i 373, 894 P.2d 70 
(1995). In such circumstances, a conviction will not be reversed "unless the defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime." Motta, 66 
Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020 (emphasis added).

On appeal, Muller asserts for the first time that the 
indictment failed to allege all the essential elements of the 
offense charged. Specifically, Muller contends that Count II of the indictment failed to allege the essential element that Muller and the complainant were not married to each other, rendering the charge deficient. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has set out the four 
material elements of the offense of sexual assault in the third degree under HRS § 707-732(1)(b), one of which is "that [the defendant] was aware that the Minor was not married to him (i.e., the requisite knowing state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstance implicit in 'sexual contact,' . . .) [.]". State v. 
Arceo, 84 Hawai
'i 1, 15, 928 P.2d 843, 857 (1996). Therefore, 
Count II should have alleged that Muller was aware that the complainant was not married to him. 
Although Muller challenges the sufficiency of the 
charge for the first time on appeal, it appears that even in this circumstance his conviction must be vacated and the case remanded for dismissal without prejudice. Recently, in State v. Akitake, No. SCWC-29934 (Haw. Jan. 10, 2014) (SDO), the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court held in similar circumstances, i.e. the defendant challenged the charge for the first time on appeal, that because the charge lacked an allegation of an attendant circumstance which was an element of the offense, the charge failed to state the subject offense. The majority in Akitake relied on State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 358, 311 P.3d 676, 681 (2013), and 
stated in relevant part: 
As the charge lacked an allegation of an attendant
circumstance, which is an element of the offense of OVUII,
it failed to state the offense of OVUII. Cf. State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 358, 311 P.3d 676, 681 (2013)
(dismissing without prejudice excessive speeding complaint,
the deficiency of which was raised for the first time onappeal, because complaint failed to allege mens rea, andcould therefore not be construed to state the offense of excessive speeding). 
Akitake, SDO at *1. The relevant portion of Apollonio, in turn,
 
held that even under the liberal construction standard, because
 the charge failed to allege the required mens rea, the charge
 "cannot be reasonably construed to state an offense." 130

Hawai'i at 358, 311 P.3d at 681 (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
Here, Count II failed to allege an attendant
 
circumstance which was an element of the offense. Under the
 
holdings and rulings in Apollonio and Akitake, even though Muller
 did not challenge the sufficiency of the charge until this
 appeal, the charge "cannot be reasonably construed to state an
 offense" and the conviction must be vacated. We need not reach
 Muller's other points of error.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of
 
Conviction and Probation Sentence filed on November 16, 2010, in
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is vacated and the case
 is remanded with instructions to dismiss the case without
 prejudice.
