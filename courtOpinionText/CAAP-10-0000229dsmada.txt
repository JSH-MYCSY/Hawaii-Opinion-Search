IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
In the Matter of the Application of
HAWAII ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, INC.
For Approval of Rate Increases and
Revised Rate Schedules and Rules
 
APPEAL FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION
 
(DOCKET NO. 05-0315)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in this case, it appears that
 
we lack jurisdiction over Intervenor-Appellant Keahole Defense
 
Coalition, Inc.'s (Keahole Defense Coalition), appeal from
 Appellee Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii's
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1
(the PUC)  October 28, 2010 decision and order in PUC Docket No.
05-0315, because the PUC's October 28, 2010 decision and order is
 
not the final order that ended the proceeding in PUC Docket No.
 05-0315, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 269-15.5 (2007)
 requires for an appealable final order.
 
Administrative appeals commence in a circuit court 
"except where a statute provides for a direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court[.]" 
HRS § 91-14(b) (1993 & Supp. 
2010). "Matters relating to the PUC are governed by HRS ch. 269." Peterson v. Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 
Hawai'i 322, 327, 944 P.2d 1265, 1270 (1997), superseded on other 
grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp. 1999). HRS § 269-15.5 (2007) authorizes an aggrieved person to appeal from a final order of the PUC directly to the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
Cf. In re Waikoloa Sanitary Sewer Company, Inc., 109 Hawai' i 263, 
270, 125 P.3d 484, 491 (2005). 
§ 269-15.5. Appeals.
An appeal from an order of the public utilities
commission under this chapter shall lie subject to chapter
602, in the manner provided for civil appeals from the
circuit courts. Only a person aggrieved in a contested case
proceeding provided for in this chapter may appeal from the
order, if the order is final, or if preliminary, is of the
nature defined by section 91-14(a). 
HRS § 269-15.5 (quoted in part; emphases added). In the context 
of obtaining judicial review of administrative agency proceedings, "[g]enerally, a 'final order' is an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai' i 164, 168, 86

 In this matter, the Appellee Public Utilities Commission of the
State of Hawai' i was composed of Chairman Carlito P. Caliboso, Commissioner
John E. Cole, and Commissioner Leslie H. Kondo.

P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (citation and some internal quotation marks 
omitted). "Consequently, an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Gealon v. Keala, 60 Haw. 513, 520, 591 P.2d 
621, 626 (1979) (citations omitted). 
In the instant case, it appears that the PUC's
 
October 28, 2010 decision and order is not a final order because,
 although the PUC's October 28, 2010 decision and order approved
 an increase in Applicant-Appellee Hawaii Electric Light Company,
 Inc's HELCO)rates, the PUC's October 28, 2010 decision and order
 did not end the proceeding because the PUC's October 28, 2010
 decision and order further directed that HELCO file corresponding
 revised tariff sheets and rate schedules for future approval by
 the PUC, and the PUC's October 28, 2010 decision and order
 specifically provided that the filing would not take effect until
 the PUC approved the revised tariff sheets and rate schedules. 
Therefore, the PUC's October 28, 2010 decision and order is not
 the appealable final order in this administrative proceeding. 
Instead, the appealable final order in this proceeding appears to
 be the PUC's January 7, 2011 order approving HELCO's revised
 tariff sheets and rate schedules, from which Appellant Keahole
 Defense Coalition has asserted an appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11­0000067.
 
Under the circumstances of the instant case, Appellant
 
Keahole Defense Coalition's December 17, 2010 notice of appeal in
 appellate court case number CAAP-10-0000229 is not effective and,
 thus, we lack jurisdiction. Accordingly,
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 1, 2011.
