NO. CAAP-10-0000235
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
LESLIE WATSON, JR. and BERA ARON, Plaintiffs-Appellees, v.
MILAGROS SYLVESTER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC10-1-4588)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Milagros Sylvester (Appellant Sylvester) has asserted from the
 proceedings before the Honorable Steven M. Nakashima, because the
 record on appeal does not contain a written order or written
 judgment that resolves the parties' claims in this case. 
Appeals from civil cases in district court may be taken
 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 &
 Supp. 2010).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.

Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). The final judgment or order must be in 
writing, because an "oral decision is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai' i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005) 
(citing Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP)). "A judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." HRAP Rule 4(a)(5). "In civil cases before the district court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry." KNG Corp. 
v. Kim, 107 Hawai' i at 77, 110 P.3d at 401 (quoting District 
Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 58; internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The record on appeal does not contain an appealable 
judgment or appealable order. "It is the responsibility of each appellant to provide a record, as defined in Rule 10(a) and the Hawai'i Court Records Rules, that is sufficient to review the 
points asserted and to pursue appropriate proceedings in the 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court or agency from which the appeal is taken to correct any
 
omission." HRAP Rule 11(a) (quoted in part, as amended
 August 30, 2010, effective September 27, 2010). Absent an
 appealable judgment or appealable order, Appellant Sylvester's
 appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any
court considering and resolving an appeal or
original action. Appellate courts, upon
determining that they lack jurisdiction shall
not require anything other than a dismissal of
the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case
further. Thus, appellate courts have an
obligation to insure that they have jurisdiction
to hear and determine each case. The lack of
 subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived
by any party at any time. Accordingly, when we
perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal,
we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal.

Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 
1215 n.10 (1994). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000235 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
