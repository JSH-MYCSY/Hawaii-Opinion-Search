NO. CAAP-10-0000236
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
STELLA SILVA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES K. SILVA, JR. and PAULA SILVA, Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. RC-09-1-0824)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendants-Appellants
 
James K. Silva, Jr. and Paula Silva (Appellants) have asserted
 from the Honorable Calvin K. Murashige's November 16, 2010
 judgment awarding attorneys' fees and costs to Plaintiff-Appellee
 Stella Silva (Appellee), because the district court has not yet
 entered a written order or written judgment that resolves
 Appellee’s remaining claim for breach-of-lease money damages,
 and, absent an appealable final order or final judgment on that
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
remaining claim, the November 16, 2010 judgment awarding
 
attorneys' fees and costs is not eligible for appellate review.
 
Appellants are appealing pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule
 under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76
 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). In cases such as the instant case where there
 
is no requirement for a separate judgment, and
 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.

 quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted).

The district court has not resolved all of the
 
substantive claims in this case. The district court resolved 
Appellee’s claim for summary possession by entering a January 28, 2010 judgment for possession, but the district court has not entered any written order or written judgment resolving Appellee’s claim for breach-of-lease money damages. Although the district court entered a November 16, 2010 judgment awarding attorneys' fees and costs, the November 16, 2010 judgment does not adjudicate Appellee’s claim for breach-of-lease money damages. An award of attorneys' fees "is not a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 
116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Absent entry of an appealable final judgment on the claims [to which an award of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of attorneys' fees and costs is . . . not appealable." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 
at 123, 19 P.3d at 706; CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., Inc., 95 Hawai'i 301, 306, 22 P.3d 97, 102 (App. 2001) ("Similarly, the 
September 23, 1999 Order [awarding only attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment [awarding only attorneys' fees] are not appealable, and we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review them."). 
In the instant case, Appellants’ appeal is premature,
 
because the district court has not yet entered a final order or
 final judgment on Appellee’s remaining claim for breach-of-lease
 money damages. Absent an appealable final order or final
 judgment on Appellee’s remaining claim, the November 16, 2010

judgment awarding attorneys' fees and costs is not yet eligible
 
for appellate review. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000236 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
