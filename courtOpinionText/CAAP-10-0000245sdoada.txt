) appeals from
 
the December 15, 2010 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order

Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
violation of Section 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes. JAMES B. FLYNN is subject to sentencing as a
first offender in accordance with Section 291E-61(b)(l) of the
Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
On December 15, 2010, the date of trial, Flynn filed a
 
motion to dismiss asserting, inter alia, that the failure to
 
allege the requisite state of mind deprived the District Court of
 
jurisdiction. The District Court denied the motion. Also on
 
December 15, 2010, the State arraigned Flynn on the Complaint. 
Flynn orally renewed his motion to dismiss, and the District
 
Court again denied the motion. The trial proceeded and at the
 
conclusion of trial, the District Court found Flynn guilty under
 
HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and (3) and subsequently entered its judgment
 
of conviction. This timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Flynn contends that the District Court erred 
in denying his motion to dismiss the charge because it omitted 
the mens rea for the offense, allegedly an "essential fact" under 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 7(d), thereby depriving the 
court of jurisdiction, and that the District Court consequently erred in convicting him on the defective charge. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
conclude that the complaint was not required to allege a mens rea 
in order to be sufficient, and we reject Flynn's challenge to the 
sufficiency of the complaint. See State v. Nesmith, 2011 WL 
2685719, __ Hawai' i __, __ P.3d __ (App. June 22, 2011). The 
District Court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss.
