APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-0332)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/
 
Appellants Exclusive Resorts PBL1, LLC, and Exclusive Resorts
 
PBL3, LLC's (the Exclusive Resorts Appellants), appeal from the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Honorable Greg K. Nakamura's December 1, 2010 judgment, and
 
(2) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-10-0000249 because the December 1, 2010 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)(1993 & Supp. 2010), Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), 
and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). The rules of the court require, among other things, that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id.
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. When interpreting 
the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[W]e should not make such searches necessary by allowing the 
parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as 
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. 
Although the instant case involves multiple parties and
 
multiple claims (e.g., the claims in the amended complaint, the
 counterclaim, and numerous cross-claims), the December 1, 2010
 judgment expressly enters judgment only in favor of the Exclusive
 Resorts Appellants and against Plaintiffs/Counterclaim­Defendants/Appellees Roaring Lion, LLC, David Cowan, Nathalie
 Cowan, Umang P. Gupta, Ruth M. Gupta, and Pauoa Beach 8 LLC
 (Appellees), as to all claims in the Appellees’ complaint and
 amended complaint. The December 1, 2010 judgment, however, does
 not: (1) enter judgment as to the other parties; (2) enter
 judgment on the parties' other claims, such as the counterclaim
 and the cross-claims; (3) expressly dismiss any of the
 unidentified claims; or (4) contain an express finding of no just
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
reason for delay in the entry of a judgment on one or more but
 
less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the
 December 1, 2010 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for
 an appealable judgment in a multiple-claim and multiple-party
 case under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins.
 
When parties stipulate to dismiss claims pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B), "a separate judgment is neither required nor authorized, inasmuch as a plaintiff’s dismissal of an action, by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties [pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B)], is effective without order of the court." Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai' i 152, 158 n.7, 977 
P.2d 160, 166 n.7 (1999) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). However, in order to effectuate a dismissal without any order of the court, the stipulation to dismiss must be "signed by all parties who have appeared in the action." HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B). 
The parties herein have attempted to dismiss some of
 
their claims through the following six stipulations for dismissal
 that fail to satisfy the requirements of HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) in
 that they are not signed by all parties who have appeared in the
 action:
 
(1)	 a July 12, 2007 "Stipulation Pursuant to Haw[.] R.
 
Civ. P. 41(c) for Dismissal without Prejudice of (1)
All Cross-Claims by Defendant Pauoa Bay Properties,
LLC[,] against Defendants Exclusive Resorts PBL1,
LLC[,] and Exclusive Resorts PBL3, LLC; and (2) All
Cross-Claims by Defendants Exclusive Resorts PBL1,
LLC[,] and Exclusive Resorts PBL3, LLC[,] against
Defendant Pauoa Bay Properties, LLC";
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) a July 16, 2007 "Stipulation Pursuant to Haw. R. Civ.
P. 41(c) for Dismissal without Prejudice of (1) All
Cross-Claims by Defendant Pauoa Beach Realty, LLC[,]
against Defendants Exclusive Resorts PBL1, LLC; and
(2) All Cross-Claims by Defendant Exclusive Resorts
PBL1, LLC[,] against Defendant Pauoa Beach Realty,
LLC";
 
(3) a July 23, 2007 "Stipulation Pursuant to Haw. R. Civ.
P. 41(c) for Dismissal without Prejudice of (1) All
Cross-Claims by Defendant White Sand Beach Limited
Partnership against Defendant Exclusive Resorts PBL1,
LLC; and (2) All Cross-Claims by Defendant Exclusive
Resorts PBL1, LLC[,] against Defendant White Sand
Beach Limited Partnership";
 
(4)	 a March 17, 2008 "Stipulation for Dismissal with
Prejudice of All Claims against Defendants White Sand
Beach Limited Partnership, Pauoa Bay Properties,
LLC[,] and Pauoa Beach Realty, LLC[,] and Order";
 
(5)	 a June 17, 2010 "Stipulation Pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P.
Rules 41(a)(1) and 41(c) for Dismissal without Prejudice of
the Counterclaim Filed November 4, 2004, by Defendant
Exclusive Resorts PBL1, LLC, against Plaintiffs"; and
 
(6)	 an October 1, 2010 "Stipulation Pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P.
Rules 41(a)(1) and 41(c) for Dismissal of the Counterclaim
Filed August 8, 2005, by Defendant Exclusive Resorts PBL1,
LLC, against Plaintiffs[.]"
 
Because the above six stipulations fail to satisfy the
 
requirements of HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B), the final judgment in this
 case must, on its face, resolve all the claims that the six
 stipulations fail to effectively dismiss.
 
As already stated, the December 1, 2010 judgment does
 
not, on its face, resolve all of the claims in this case, and the
 December 1, 2010 judgment does not contain an express finding of
 no just reason for delay in the entry of a judgment on one or
 more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Therefore, the December 1, 2010 judgment does not satisfy the
 requirements for an appealable final judgment in a multiple-claim
 and multiple-party case under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
 Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, the Appellants'
 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction over this
 
case.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
