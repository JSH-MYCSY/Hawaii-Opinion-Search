Plea/Judgment filed in the District Court of the First Circuit,

Court's judgment.2
 
On November 1, 2010, a Complaint was filed charging
 
Soria as follows: 
On or about the 11th day of October, 2010, in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, EMILIO SORIA did
operate or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon
a public way, street, road, or highway while under the
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his
normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and
guard against casualty, thereby committing the offense of
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
violation of Section 291E-61(a)(l) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes. EMILIO SORIA is subject to sentencing as a first
offender in accordance with Section 291E-61(b)(1) of the
Hawaii Revised Statutes.

 In light of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address
the State's claim that we should dismiss the appeal because Soria failed tocomply with Hawai
»i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). We note that Soria 
failed to file a reply brief or notification that no reply brief would be
filed, as required under HRAP Rule 28(d). Soria's counsel is cautioned that future violations of the rules may result in sanctions.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On December 6, 2010, the date of trial, Soria filed a
 
motion to dismiss, asserting, among other things, that the
 
failure to allege state of mind (mens rea) deprived the District
 Court of jurisdiction. The District Court denied the motion. 
The trial resulted in Soria's conviction under Hawaii Revised
 Statutes § 291E-61(a)(1). This timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Soria contends that the District Court erred 
in denying his motion to dismiss the defective charge which omitted the requisite state of mind for the offense. Soria argues that the state of mind is an essential fact required under Rule 7(d) of the Hawai» i Rules of Penal Procedure, that the 
State's failure to allege that fact thereby deprived the District Court of jurisdiction, and that the District Court consequently erred in convicting him on the defective charge. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we conclude that the Complaint was not required to allege a state of mind in order to be sufficient, and we reject Soria's challenge to the sufficiency of the Complaint. State v. Nesmith, ____ 
Hawai» i ____, ____ P.3d ____ (App. 2011); No. CAAP-10-0000072, 
2011 WL 2685719 (Haw. Ct. App. Jun. 22, 2011). Consequently, the District Court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss and in convicting Soria. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court's
 
December 6, 2010 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 Plea/Judgment is affirmed.
