OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
CHARLES ANTHONY STANLEY, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0034 (Cr. No. 04-1-0049))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Charles Anthony Stanley (Stanley)
 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, Filed June 3, 2010" 
(Order) filed on September 9, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
First Circuit  (circuit court).
 A jury convicted Stanley of Robbery in the Second
 
Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708­841(1)(a) (1993). 
The circuit court entered the Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence (Judgment) on February 24, 2005.
 
Stanley filed an appeal (No. 27144) from the Judgment,
 
contending that the circuit court erred by denying his two oral
 motions for judgment of acquittal, allowing a juror to remain on
 
the jury, denying his Motion to Dismiss, and finding that he

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
qualified as a repeat offender. This court filed a Summary
 
Disposition Order on October 24, 2006, affirming the Judgment.
 
On October 13, 2005, Stanley filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (First Petition) in the circuit court in S.P.P.
 
No. 05-1-0066, pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal
 
Procedure (HRPP). Stanley stated four claims: (1) denial of
 
effective assistance of counsel because defense counsel did not
 
get evidence from the evidence room and other locations in
 
preparation for trial, (2) conviction obtained by use of evidence
 
gained pursuant to an unconstitutional search and seizure, (3)
 
conviction obtained by use of evidence obtained pursuant to an
 
unlawful arrest, and (4) conviction obtained by unconstitutional
 
failure of the prosecution to disclose to Stanley evidence
 
favorable to him. On February 3, 2006, the circuit court denied
 
the First Petition. Stanley did not appeal the denial of the
 
First Petition.
 
On May 29, 2007, Stanley filed a Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 
Custody (Second Petition), pursuant to HRPP Rule 40, in the
 
circuit court in S.P.P. 07-1-0023. Stanley stated seven claims: 
(1) violation of his right to due process and fair trial by the
 
failure to introduce a black bag into evidence and to allow the
 
jury to inspect the black bag during deliberations; (2)
 
prosecutorial misconduct because the prosecutor (a) failed to
 
introduce the black bag into evidence and (b) raised his hands
 
into a fighting stance without holding the black bag during the
 
prosecutor's closing argument; (3) ineffective assistance of
 
trial counsel because counsel failed to get the black bag
 
admitted into evidence, obtain the store's video surveillance
 
tape for trial, subpoena Police Officer Leong (who viewed the
 
videotape) and Brandon Wong, prepare for trial, and file a timely
 
request for a new trial; (4) unconstitutional seizure of his body
 
when security officers grabbed him during the arrest, (5)
 
criminalization of his involuntary act of responding to the use

of force; (6) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because
 
appellate counsel failed to raise the above issues on appeal; and
 
(7) unconstitutional selection of a jury that excluded African-
American jurors. On September 27, 2007, the circuit court denied
 
the Second Petition. Stanley appealed, and on April 21, 2009,
 
this court issued a Memorandum Opinion, affirming the denial of
 
the Second Petition. 
On June 3, 2010, Stanley filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Third Petition) (S.P.P. 10-1-0034), pursuant
 
to HRPP Rule 40. Stanley claimed:

THE COURT FOR REVIEW.
 
On September 9, 2009, the Circuit Court denied
 
Stanley's Third Petition. Stanley timely appealed.
 
On appeal, Stanley contends:
 
1. The Judgment was obtained and sentence imposed in 
violation of Article III, § 1, Hawai
'i State Constitution. 
2. The sentence is illegal, the circuit court did not
 
have subject matter jurisdiction, as mandated by Article III,
 
§ 1, under HRS § 708-841(1)(a).
 
3. Stanley's rights were violated under Article 1, 
§ 5, of the Hawai' i State Constitution to due process and equal 
protection of the law. 
4. Jurisdiction cannot be waived in a Complaint,
 
"Structural Defects require automatic reversal," United States
 Constitutional Amendment 6.
 
5. The circuit court did not have jurisdiction to 
enforce conviction based on § 708-841(1)(b), which violated 
Article 1, § 14, of the Hawai' i State Constitution. 
6. The circuit court did not properly deny Stanley's
 
Rule 40, where the facts prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a
 
"Threatened use of Force" HRS § 708-841(1)(b) was not within the
 
complaint, and the court exceeded its subject-matter jurisdiction
 
by its generic definition of use of force.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
7. The circuit court erroneously used HRPP Rule
 
40(a)(3) to procedurally default granting relief, where the trial
 
court exceeded its subject matter jurisdiction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Stanley's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not lack subject matter 
jurisdiction. HRS §§ 603-1 (Supp. 2010) and 603-21.5 (Supp. 
2003). "[P]roof that an event occurred in the City and County of 
Honolulu or on the Island of Oahu is proof that it occurred 
within the first judicial circuit." State v. Correa, 5 Haw. App. 
644, 650, 706 P.2d 1321, 1325 (1985). The Complaint against Stanley alleged that he committed Robbery in the Second Degree in 
the City and County of Honolulu. Robbery in the Second Degree is 
a criminal offense under the laws of the State of Hawai' i as 
specified by HRS § 708-841(1)(a). The City and County of Honolulu is within the first judicial circuit. Stanley was 
charged and tried in the first judicial circuit. Therefore, the 
circuit court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction. 
(2) A charge of Robbery in the Second Degree which 
does not define the term "force" is readily comprehensible to a 
person of common understanding; therefore, the charge was 
sufficient. "Force" is consistent with its commonly understood 
meaning and provided Stanley with notice of what was being 
charged. State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 392, 245 P.3d 458, 465 
(2010). Therefore, the charge against Stanley was not insufficient, and the circuit court did not lack jurisdiction to 
enter a judgment of conviction for Robbery in the Second Degree. 
(3) To the extent that Stanley stated any claims not
 
based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction or lack of
 
jurisdiction because the charge was insufficient, those claims
 
are waived. Stanley did not prove the existence of extraordinary
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issues in his
 
direct appeal or two prior HRPP Rule 40 petitions. Therefore,
 
relief is not available pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. HRPP Rule
 
40(a)(3).
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief, Filed June 3, 2010," filed on September 9,
 
2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
