(CRIMINAL NOS. 88-2209 & 89-0024)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Michael C. Tierney, also known as
 
Michael C. King ("Tierney"), appeals from the December 28, 2010
 
order that denied his "Motion To Set Aside Bond Forfeiture" filed
 on February 3, 2010, "Motion For Hearing For Motion To Set Aside
 Bond Forfeiture Of $
10,100.00" filed on December 22, 2010, and
 
"Motion For Hearing Dated October 31, 2010" filed on December 23,
 2010 (collectively, "Motions"), without a hearing, filed in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1 The
 
Motions reiterated Tierney's earlier request for the return of
 $10,100.00 cash bail, and, in addition, requested a hearing under
 Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 804-51 to set aside the denial of the
 earlier request. 
Tierney contends that the Circuit Court erred in not
 
returning to him $10,100.00 in bail money posted by a third party
 in criminal case numbers 88-2209 and 89-0024 pursuant to Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ยง 804-51 (1985), and in not conducting a hearing
 before denying the Motions.
