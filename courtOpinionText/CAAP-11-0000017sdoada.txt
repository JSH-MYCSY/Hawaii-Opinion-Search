HENRY KAPONONUIAHOPILI LII, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0010 (Cr. Nos. 88-0826 & 88-2308))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant pro se Henry Kapononuiahopili Lii
 
(Lii) appeals from the Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction
 
Relief Without A Hearing filed on December 23, 2010 in the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
On March 31, 2010, Lii filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Petition). 
In the Petition, Lii contended
 
that (1) he did not voluntarily and knowingly enter into the plea
 
agreement in Cr. No. 88-0826 because he did not offer to sell
 
methamphetamine to or buy methamphetamine from an undercover
 
police officer; (2) he should have been sentenced pursuant to the
 
Youthful Offender Act, HRS § 706-667 (Supp. 1987); (3) he had
 
ineffective counsel because counsel failed to advise him that he
 
qualified for sentencing as a youthful offender and counsel had

him plead to the wrong elements of the crime in Cr. No. 88-0826;
 
and (4) he was being held beyond his maximum sentence, pursuant
 
to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Lii's appeal is without merit.
 
(1) Contrary to Lii's claim, the record demonstrates
 
he knowingly and voluntarily entered into his plea agreement. 
Manifest injustice has not been demonstrated, and Lii is not
 
entitled to withdraw his guilty plea. State v. Cornelio, 68 Haw.
 
644, 646-47, 727 P.2d 1125, 1126-27 (1986).
 
(2) Lii was not eligible for sentencing under the
 
Youthful Offender Act, HRS § 706-667. When Lii was sentenced,
 HRS § 706-667 was limited to defendants who were less than 22
 
years of age at the time of sentencing. At the time of Lii's
 
sentencing in Cr. Nos. 88-0826 and 88-2308, he was not less than
 
22 years of age.
 
(3) Lii's counsel was not ineffective for failing to
 
advise him that he was eligible to be sentenced under HRS § 706­
667 because Lii was not eligible to be sentenced as a youthful
 
offender. Lii's counsel also was not ineffective because Lii did
 
not plead guilty to the wrong crime or element. In Lii's guilty
 
plea in Cr. No. 88-0826, the factual basis for Lii's plea was
 
that "[o]n October 8, 1987, I sold $50.00 worth of cocaine to an
 
undercover policeman." Therefore, Lii did not plead guilty to
 
the wrong offense or element of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
 
Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1242 (Supp. 1987),
 
because he admitted that he distributed or sold cocaine in an
 
amount to another.
 
(4) The circuit court did not sentence Lii to an
 
extended term sentence in either Cr. No. 88-0826 or Cr. No. 88­
2308. Therefore, Apprendi is not applicable.
