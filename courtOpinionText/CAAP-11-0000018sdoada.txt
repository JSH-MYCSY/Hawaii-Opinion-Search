of 1,907 days.2 The Circuit Court further ordered, pursuant to
 
3
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-656 (Supp. 1988),  the
Director of the Department of Public Safety and the Hawai' i 
Paroling Authority to prepare an application for the Governor to 
commute the sentence to life imprisonment with parole at the end 
of twenty years of imprisonment. 
On November 3, 2010, Samonte filed a "Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
from Custody" (Petition), pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 40 (2006). Samonte claimed that because he had been incarcerated for twenty years, his request for commutation 
should have been granted by the Governor. The Circuit Court 
denied Samonte's Petition. 
On appeal, Samonte argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
in denying his Petition. He repeats his claim that because he
 
has been incarcerated for more than twenty years, he was entitled 
2 The Honorable Leland H. Spencer imposed the sentence on Samonte's
attempted first degree murder conviction.
 
3 At the time relevant to this case, HRS § 706-656(1) (Supp. 1988)
provided in relevant part:
 
(1) Persons convicted of first degree murder or first degree
attempted murder shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without
possibility of parole.
 
As part of such sentence the court shall order the director
of the department of corrections and the Hawaii paroling authority
to prepare an application for the governor to commute the sentence
to life imprisonment with parole at the end of twenty years of
imprisonment . . . .
 
HRS § 706-656(1) was subsequently amended effective July 1, 1990, to replace
the reference to "the director of the department of corrections" with "the
director of public safety" because the employees and functions of the
Department of Corrections were transferred to the Department of Public Safety.
See 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 211, § 8 at 434. Other than this amendment, the
terms of HRS § 706-656(1) have not changed.

to have his sentence commuted by the Governor. In support of his
 
argument, Samonte cites HRS § 706-656. He also attaches to his
 
opening brief a November 29, 2010, letter from the Governor's
 
Chief of Staff notifying Samonte of the denial of his application
 
for commutation.
 
Samonte's argument is based on his misreading of HRS 
§ 706-656. The statute does not entitle a person (like Samonte)
 
who is convicted of attempted first degree murder to have his or
 
her sentence commuted after serving twenty years of
 
incarceration. HRS § 706-656 only requires the sentencing court
 
to "order the director of [public safety] and the Hawaii paroling
 
authority to prepare an application for the governor to commute
 
the sentence to life imprisonment with parole at the end of
 
twenty years of imprisonment[.]" HRS § 706-656 (emphasis added). 
In other words, HRS § 706-656 requires the preparation of a
 
commutation application for the Governor. It does not require
 
the Governor to approve the application. Thus, there is no valid
 
basis for Samonte's claim that he is entitled to the commutation
 
of his sentence by virtue of his having served twenty years of
 
imprisonment. 
The record shows that in imposing sentence on Samonte,
 
the Circuit Court ordered the preparation of a commutation
 
application pursuant to HRS § 706-656. The record further shows
 
that a commutation application for Samonte was submitted to the
 
Governor. In denying Samonte's Petition, the Circuit Court found
 
that a commutation application was prepared and submitted to the
 
Governor in accordance with HRS § 706-656. We conclude that the
 
Circuit Court properly denied Samonte's Petition.
