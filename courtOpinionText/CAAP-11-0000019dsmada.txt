APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ORDER DENYING SEPTEMBER 19, 2011 MOTION
TO DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/ 
Appellee UniDev, LCC's (Appellee UniDev), September 19, 2011 
motion to dismiss Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant County of Hawaii's (Appellant County of Hawai
'i) appeal in 
appellate court case number CAAP-11-000019 for lack of jurisdiction, (2) Appellant County of Hawaii's October 3, 2011 memorandum in opposition to Appellee UniDev's September 19, 2011 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, (3) Appellee UniDev's October 10, 2011 reply memorandum in support of Appellee UniDev's September 19, 2011 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and (4) the record, it appears that, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010) and the collateral order doctrine, we have jurisdiction over Appellant County of Hawaii's appeal from the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's December 17, 2010 "Order Granting Counterclaimant UniDev, LLC's[,] Motion to Compel Alternative Dispute Resolution and to Stay Proceedings" (the December 17, 2010 order compelling alternative dispute resolution) and January 3, 2011 "Amended Order Granting Counterclaimant UniDev, LLC's[,] Motion to Compel Alternative Dispute Resolution and to Stay Proceedings (the January 3, 2011 amended order compelling alternative dispute resolution). 
Appellee UniDev argues that this case involves
 
contracts that involve interstate commerce, and the Federal
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Arbitration Act, i.e., 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (FAA), governs
 
arbitration agreements that involve interstate commerce. 
Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 12-13 (1984). "The
 overarching purpose of the FAA . . . is to ensure the enforcement
 of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to
 facilitate streamlined proceedings." AT&T Mobility LLC v.
 
Concepcion, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 1748 (2011). Furthermore, 9 U.S.C.
 § 16 (2006) of the FAA contains provisions that prohibit an
 appeal from an interlocutory order that directs or compels
 arbitration to proceed:
 
§ 16. Appeals
 
(a)	 An appeal may be taken from -­(1)	 an order -­(A)	 refusing a stay of any action under
section 3 of this title,
 
(B)	 denying a petition under section 4
of this title to order arbitration
 to proceed,
 
(C)	 denying an application under section
206 of this title to compel
arbitration,
 
(D)	 confirming or denying confirmation
of an award or partial award, or 
(E)	 modifying, correcting, or vacating
an award;
 
(2)	 an interlocutory order granting,
continuing, or modifying an injunction
against an arbitration that is subject to
this title; or
 
(3)	 a final decision with respect to an
arbitration that is subject to this title.
 
(b)	 Except as otherwise provided in section
1292(b) of title 28, an appeal may not be
taken from an interlocutory order -­
(1)	 granting a stay of any action under
section 3 of this title;
 
(2)	 directing arbitration to proceed under
section 4 of this title;
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-(3)compelling arbitration under section 206
of this title; or
(4)refusing to enjoin an arbitration that is
subject to this title.
9 U.S.C. § 16 (emphases added).  Therefore, an issue exists
whether subsection (2) or (3) of 9 U.S.C. § 16(b) prohibits
Appellant County of Hawaii's appeal from the December 17, 2010
order compelling alternative dispute resolution and the
January 3, 2011 amended order compelling alternative dispute
resolution.
The Supreme Court of Hawai #i has acknowledged that
"[v]irtually every state and federal court that has considered
the preemptive effect of the FAA has concluded that . . . the FAA
applies equally in state or federal courts."  Brown v. KFC
National Management Co., 82 Hawai# i 226, 234, 921 P.2d 146, 154
(1996).  Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has held
that "States cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with
the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons."  AT&T
Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 1753 (2011) (holding
that the FAA preempts California's judicial rule regarding the
unconscionability of class arbitration waivers in consumer
contracts).  Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court has
also held that the FAA did not preempt a California law regarding
arbitration where the parties' contract contained a choice-of-law
clause providing that the California state rules of arbitration
would govern their disputes:
Unlike its federal counterpart, the California
Arbitration Act, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. § 1280 et seq. 
(West 1982), contains a provision allowing a court to stay
arbitration pending resolution of related litigation.  We 
hold that application of the  California statute is not pre-
empted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U.S.C.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-5-§ 1 et sq., in a case where the parties have agreed that
their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of
California.
Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior University, 489 U.S. 468, 470 (1989)
(emphasis added).
There is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a 
certain set of procedural rules; the federal policy is 
simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their 
terms, of private agreements to arbitrate.  Interpreting a
choice-of-law clause to make applicable state rules
governing the conduct of arbitration - rules which are 
manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral 
process - simply does not offend the rule of liberal
construction set forth in [prior case law],  nor does it
offend any other policy embodied in the FAA.
Id. at 476 (footnote and citation omitted; emphases added).  "It
is undisputed that this contract falls within the coverage of the
FAA, since it involves interstate commerce, and that the FAA
contains no provision authorizing a stay of arbitration in this
situation."  Id.  Nevertheless, "even if [provisions] of the FAA
are fully applicable in state-court proceedings, they do not
prevent application of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. § 1281.2(c) to
stay arbitration where, as here, the parties have agreed to
arbitrate in accordance with California law.”  Id. at 477.  "The
FAA contains no express pre-emptive provision, nor does it
reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of
arbitration."  Id.  "But even when Congress has not completely
displaced state regulation in an area, state law may nonetheless
be pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with
federal law - that is, to the extent that it stands as an
obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes
and objectives of Congress."  Id. (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The FAA was designed to overrule the judiciary's long-
standing refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate, . . .
and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other
contracts. . . . While Congress was no doubt aware that the
Act would encourage the expeditious resolution of disputes,
its passage was motivated, first and foremost, by a
congressional desire to enforce agreements into which
parties had entered. . . . Accordingly, we have recognized
that the FAA does not require parties to arbitrate when they
have not agreed to do so, . . . . nor does it prevent
parties who do agree to arbitrate from excluding certain
claims from the scope of their arbitration agreement, . . .
 . It simply requires courts to enforce privately negotiated
agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance
with their terms.
 
Id. at 478 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
In recognition of Congress' principal purpose of
ensuring that private arbitration agreements are enforced
according to their terms, we have held that the FAA pre­empts state laws which require a judicial forum for the
resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to
resolve by arbitration. . . . But it does not follow that
 the FAA prevents the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate
under different rules than those set forth in the Act
 itself. Indeed, such a result would be quite inimical to
the FAA's primary purpose of ensuring that private
agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their
terms. Arbitration under the Act is a matter of consent,
not coercion, and parties are generally free to structure
their arbitration agreements as they see fit
. Just
 
as they may limit by contract the issues which they will
arbitrate, . . . so too may 
they specify by contract the
rules under which that arbitration will be conducted. 
Where, as here, the parties have agreed to abide by state
rules of arbitration, enforcing those rules according to the
terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of
the FAA,  even if the result is that arbitration is stayed
where the Act would otherwise permit it to go forward. By
permitting the courts to rigorously enforce such agreements
according to their terms, . . . we give effect to the
contractual rights and expectations of the parties, without
doing violence to the policies behind by the FAA.
 
Id. at 478-79 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted;
 
emphases added). More recently, in 2010, the United States
 Supreme Court has reiterated that, notwithstanding the FAA, the
 courts and arbitrators must give effect to the contractual rights
 of the parties, that the parties' intentions control, that
 parties may limit the issues that they choose to arbitrate, and
 that "parties . . . may agree on rules under which any
 arbitration will proceed[.]" Stolt-Nielsen, S.A. v. Animalfeeds
 
International Corp., 130 S.Ct. 1758, 1774 (2010) (citations
 
-6­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted; emphasis added) (holding that a party may not be 
compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless the party contractually agreed to submit to class arbitration). "It falls to courts and arbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations, and when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose sight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the intent of the parties." Id. at 1774-75 
(citation omitted). 
The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that, "[w]hen the 
parties choose the law of a particular state to govern their contractual relationship and the chosen law has some nexus with the parties or the contract, that law will generally be applied." Airgo, Inc. v. Horizon Cargo Transport, Inc., 66 Haw. 590, 595, 670 P.2d 1277, 1281 (1983) (citation omitted); Brown v. KFC National Management Co., 82 Hawai' i 226, 233, 921 P.2d 146, 153 
(1996); see also Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii) Inc. v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., 117 Hawai' i 357, 364-65, 183 P.3d 
734, 741-42 (2007). The contracts that contain the arbitration clauses that Appellee UniDev seeks to enforce also indicate that the parties chose that Hawai' i state law would govern any 
arbitration: 
13. Dispute. Any dispute arising under the terms of the
Agreement that is not resolved within a reasonable period of
time by authorized representatives of UniDev and the Sponsor
shall be brought to the attention of the Chief Executive
Officer of UniDev and the Executive Director of the Sponsor
for joint resolution. Thereafter, if the matter in dispute
is still unresolved, then the parties shall in good faith
mutually appoint a mediator to mediate the dispute, provided
that if the parties cannot agree upon a mediator, then
either party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction
to appoint a mediator. If the matter in dispute is still
not resolved by mediation, then the parties shall submit the
matter to arbitration as provided in the "Uniform
Arbitration Act" under State law. The award of the
 arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties
 
-7­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
unless the award is vacated or modified in the manner
 
provided in said Uniform Arbitration Act. Any mediation or
arbitration proceeding shall take place in Hilo, Hawaii,
unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties.
 
.  .  .  .
 
(Quoted in part; emphasis added). The contracts also contain the
 
following choice-of-law clause:
 
5. Governing Law. This Agreement and all contracts and
purchase orders shall be construed in accordance with, and
their performance governed by, the laws of the State of
Hawaii (the "State"). 
Further, UniDev shall comply with all
municipal, State and federal laws applicable to UniDev's
performance under this Agreement.
 
(Emphasis added). Therefore, it appears that Hawai' i state law, 
rather than 9 U.S.C. § 16 under the FAA, governs the issue 
whether Appellant County of Hawai' i may appeal from the 
December 17, 2010 order compelling alternative dispute resolution and the January 3, 2011 amended order compelling alternative dispute resolution. Under Hawai' i state law, an order compelling 
arbitration is appealable under HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine. Sher v. Cella, 114 Hawai' i 263, 266-67, 160 P.3d 
1250, 1253-54 (App. 2007); Association of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton & Walberg Co., 68 Haw. 98, 107, 705 P.2d 28, 35 (1985); Luke v. Gentry Realty, Ltd., 105 Hawai' i 241, 246 n.10, 
96 P.3d 261, 266 n.10 (2004); Douglass v. Pflueger Hawaii, Inc., 110 Hawai' i 520, 522 n.1, 135 P.3d 129, 131 n.1 (2006). 
Therefore, pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine, we have jurisdiction over Appellant County of Hawaii's appeal from the December 17, 2010 order compelling alternative dispute resolution and the January 3, 2011 amended order compelling alternative dispute resolution. 
It is noteworthy that, even in cases that did not
 
involve a contractual choice-of-law clause, state courts in other
 
-8­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdictions have held that the FAA prohibition under 9 U.S.C. 
§ 16(b) against appeals from orders compelling arbitration does not preempt state laws that govern the issue whether state courts' orders compelling arbitration are immediately appealable, because the issue of appealability is a procedural issue that state laws govern. See, e.g., Southern California Edison Co. v. 
Peabody Western Coal, 977 P.2d 769, 773 (Ariz. 1999) ("The FAA does not . . . require submission to federal procedural law."); Muao v. Grosvenor Properties, Ltd., 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 131, 137 (Cal. Ct. App. 2002) ("Therefore, like other federal procedural rules, section 16 of the FAA is not binding on our state court proceedings, provided applicable state procedures do not defeat the rights granted by Congress." (Citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)); Simmons v. Deutsche Financial Services, 532 S.E.2d 436, 440 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000) ("We conclude under the present facts that, assuming § 16 of the FAA would prohibit the appeal, it does not preempt Georgia's procedural rule allowing this appeal."); Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, 768 A.2d 620, 629 (Md. 2000) ("Accordingly, we hold that the Maryland procedural rule, recognizing an order compelling arbitration to be a final and appealable judgment, is not preempted by the FAA."); Kremer v. Rural Community Insurance Company, 788 N.W.2d 538, 602 (Neb. 2010) ("We conclude that an order compelling arbitration . . . is a final order under [Nebraska state law] . . . . We determine whether permitting an appeal from the order [pursuant to Nebraska state law] undermines the FAA's goals and objectives. We determine that it does not."). In light of 
-9­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the fact that an order compelling arbitration is an appealable 
collateral order under Hawai' i state law, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee UniDev's
 
September 19, 2011 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is
 denied.
