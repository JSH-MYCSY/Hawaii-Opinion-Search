NO. CAAP-11-0000020
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
In the Matter of the Tax Appeal of KAHANA VILLA VACATION CLUB,
Taxpayer-Appellant/Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION, Appellee/Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE TAX APPEAL COURT
 
(Tax Appeal Case No. 09-1-0019)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Taxpayer-Appellant/Appellant Kahana Villa
 
Vacation Club's (Appellant Kahana Villa Vacation Club) appeal
 from the Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's December 13, 2010 "Order
 Denying Appellant Kahana Villa Vacation Club's Motion for Summary
 Judgment Filed on September 2, 2010" (the December 13, 2010 order
 denying summary judgment) because the December 23, 2010 order
 denying summary judgment is not an appealable final decision
 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 232-19 (Supp. 2010).

HRS § 232-19 provides in part:
 
Any taxpayer or county aggrieved or the assessor may appeal
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,
from the decision of the tax appeal court by filing a
written notice of appeal with the tax appeal court and
depositing therewith the costs of appeal within thirty days
after the filing of the decision.
 
(Emphasis added). Rule 29 of the Rules of the Tax Appeal Court 
of the State of Hawai' i (RTAC) provides that, "[i]n procedural 
matters not specifically provided for by the foregoing rules, the court will be guided, to the extent applicable, by . . . the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure." However, the Supreme Court of 
Hawai'i has held that the separate document rule under HRCP Rule 
58 and the holding in Jenkins does not apply to appeals from final decisions by tax appeal courts, and, thus, "no separate judgment is required and appeals must be noted within 30 days of a [tax appeal court] decision." Alford v. City and County of 
Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 22, 122 P.3d 809, 817 (2005) (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted); Lewis v. Kawafuchi, 108 Hawai'i 69, 73, 116 P.3d 711, 715 (App. 2005). Therefore, no 
judgment is necessary for an appeal pursuant to HRS § 232-19. Nevertheless, a tax appeal court's order is appealable pursuant to HRS § 232-19 "where the decision of the court finally deciding a tax appeal is clearly ascertainable[.]" Alford, 109 Hawai' i at 
23, 122 P.3d at 818. Although HRS § 232-19 specifically authorizes an appeal from the "decision" of the tax appeal court, the word "'[d]ecision' is not defined by the statutes or rules governing tax appeals. However, consistent with the general rule of finality governing appeals, the appealable 'decision of the tax appeal court,' HRS § 232-19, should be the decision that 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
finally decides all issues in the tax appeal." Alford, 109 
Hawai'i at 23, 122 P.3d at 818 (emphasis added). 
The tax appeal court's December 18, 2010 order denying
 
summary judgment did not finally decide all issues in the tax
 
appeal, but, instead, all issues in the tax appeal are still
 pending before the tax appeal court and proceeding forward to a
 trial on the merits. Therefore, the December 18, 2010 order
 denying summary judgment is not an appealable final decision
 pursuant to HRS § 232-19. Absent an appealable final decision,
 this appeal is premature and the intermediate court of appeals
 lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000020 is
 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
