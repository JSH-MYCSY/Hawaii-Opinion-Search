IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DANIEL KAHANAOI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0521)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Daniel Kahanaoi (Kahanaoi) timely
 
appeals from the final judgment and sentence convicting him of
 
one count of Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-716(1)(e) (Supp.
 
1
2011), which was entered on January 5, 2011 in the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit (circuit court).2 Kahanaoi challenges the
 
judgment and sentence on the grounds that (1) there was
 insufficient evidence to support the conviction because the
 
testimony presented by four prosecution witnesses was
 
inconsistent with each other and (2) the prosecutor committed
 
misconduct by implying that Kahanaoi had abandoned a defense
 
because this suggestion implicated Kahanaoi's right to remain
 
1
 HRS § 707-716(1)(e) provides that "[a] person commits the offense
of terroristic threatening in the first degree if the person commits
terroristic threatening . . . [w]ith the use of a dangerous instrument."

silent and shifted the burden to him.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Kahanaoi's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) At the trial, the complainants' testimony -­
particularly that of Carlton Keliihoomalu -- established each of
 
the necessary elements of the charged offense. Accepting
 
Kahanaoi's argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence,
 
therefore, would require the court to misapply the standard of
 
review, which requires the court to view the evidence in the
 
strongest light in favor of the prosecution, and would have the
 
court improperly infringe on the role of the trier of fact
 
regarding credibility determinations and the weighing of the
 
evidence. See State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115,
 
1117 (1981) (holding that the sufficiency of the evidence is
 reviewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution); State
 
v. Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i 388, 393, 15 P.3d 314, 319 (App. 2000) 
("The appellate court will neither reconcile conflicting evidence nor interfere with the decision of the trier of fact based on the 
witnesses' credibility or the weight of the evidence."); State v. 
Hopkins, 60 Haw. 540, 542, 592 P.2d 810, 812 (1979) (holding that 
the trier of fact may accept or reject any witness's testimony in 
whole or in part). 
(2) "The law is clear in this jurisdiction that the 
appellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate court with a 
sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." Union 
Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984); see also Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 
Hawai'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995). If the appellant 
fails to provide the necessary record, the lower court must be affirmed. Union Bldg. Materials Corp., 5 Haw. App. at 151-52, 
682 P.2d at 87. This rule has been applied in the criminal context because the reviewing court has no basis upon which it 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
can determine the merits of the claim if necessary pieces of the 
record are missing. See State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai' i 333, 336, 3 
P.3d 499, 502 (2000). Here, there is no dispute that Kahanaoi did not provide a record of the PowerPoint slide, which he 
identifies as the subject of the alleged prosecutorial 
misconduct.
3 Accordingly, Kahanaoi's failure to provide a record 
of the PowerPoint slide at issue means there is not a sufficient basis for this panel to review the circuit court's holding. 
Furthermore, Rule 28(b)(7) of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) requires an appellant's opening brief 
to set forth "the argument, containing the contentions of the 
appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with 
citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record 
relied on." HRAP 28(b)(7). If the appellant fails to include 
these components in asserting an argument, the court may consider 
the issue waived. Id. Put another way, "[a]n appellate court 
need not address matters as to which the appellant has failed to present a discernible argument." Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Ltd. 
v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai' i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (App. 2000); 
see also Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 
92, 108, 176 P.3d 91, 107 (2008) (holding that appellant waived 
issue when appellant failed to explain the reasons for her 
contentions that the trial court erred). In this case, Kahanaoi 
neither cites any legal authorities nor offers any reasoning in 
support of his proposition that the prosecutor's closing 
arguments regarding an "abandoned defense" constituted 
prosecutorial misconduct. Kahanaoi makes general conclusory 
statements but a series of conclusory assertions is not an 
argument, particularly where the issue is non-obvious. Given 
Kahanaoi's failure to provide any legal reasoning as is required 
3
 To the extent that Kahanaoi also intended to challenge the
statements of the prosecutor, the only relevant record citations provided by
Kahanaoi direct the court to the discussion amongst the attorneys and the
circuit court about the slide. Accordingly, if this court were to attempt to
review the prosecutor's other statements, it would be forced to guess which
aspects of those statements were being challenged.

by HRAP 28(b)(7),  the court finds that Kahanaoi waived his
second point of error. "It is not the obligation of this court
 
to research and construct the legal arguments open to parties,
 
especially when they are represented by counsel." Sanchez v.
 
Miller
, 792 F.2d 694, 703 (7th Cir. 1986). "To do so would not
 
only strain judicial resources . . . but would also transform the
 
[] court from its legitimate advisory role to the improper role
 
of an advocate seeking out the strongest arguments and most
 
successful strategies for a party." Beaudett v. City of Hampton,
 
775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985).
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 5, 2011 Final
 
Judgment and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit is affirmed.
