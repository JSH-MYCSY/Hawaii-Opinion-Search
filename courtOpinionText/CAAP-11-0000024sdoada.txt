Hoke and sentenced him to a fine of $75 plus fees. On December
 
22, 2010, Hoke filed a notice of appeal.
 
On appeal, Hoke contends the district court lacked
 
jurisdiction because he is a citizen of the Hawaiian Kingdom.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Hoke's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
This court in State v. Ferqerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 
101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004) held that 
the State of Hawai' i has lawful jurisdiction over all
persons operating motor vehicles on public roads or highways
within the State of Hawai' i. Persons claiming to be citizens
of the Kingdom of Hawai' i and not of the State of Hawai' i are 
not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai' i applicable
to all persons (citizens and non-citizens) operating motor
vehicles on public roads and highways within the State of
Hawai'i. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 22, 2010 "Notice
 
of Entry of Judgment And/Or Order" of the District Court of the
 Third Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 25, 2012.
