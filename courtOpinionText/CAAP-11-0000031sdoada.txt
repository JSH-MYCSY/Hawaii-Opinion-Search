v.
 
FRANCIS K. KEKONA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 06-1-0224)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 Defendant-Appellant, Francis K. Kekona (Kekona)
 
appeals from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Counts I
 
and III) Notice of Entry," entered December 20, 2010 in the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  After a
 jury trial, the circuit court convicted Kekona of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-713 (1993), reckless endangering of the
 
first degree (Count I) and HRS ยง 134-07(b) and (h) (Supp. 2005),
 
ownership or possession prohibited of any firearm or ammunition
 
by a person convicted of certain crimes.
 
On appeal, Kekona contends the circuit court erred
 
when: 
1
 The Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) it failed to grant Kekona's Motion for Judgment of
 
Acquittal (Motion for Acquittal);
 
(2) the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt beyond
 
a reasonable doubt;
 
(3) the jury instructions given by the court resulted
 
in reversible error; and 
(4) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) 
committed prosecutorial misconduct to Kekona's substantial 
prejudice. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Kekona's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
(1) Kekona contends the circuit court improperly denied
 
his Motion for Acquittal where substantial evidence supports his
 
claim of defense of self and others.
 
Kekona testified that on December 27, 2005, he
 
intentionally fired a firearm at the victim's occupied vehicle,
 
striking the windshield. Subsequently, SOH charged Kekona with
 
reckless endangering in the first degree.
 
The primary issue before the court was Kekona's state 
of mind. "[S]tate of mind is a fact that must be determined by 
the trier of fact based on direct and circumstantial evidence 
adduced at trial." State v. Van Dyke, 101 Hawai' i 377, 387, 69 
P.3d 88, 98 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation and brackets omitted). A reasonable mind might fairly conclude that 
Kekona intentionally fired the firearm with the intent, 
knowledge, or reckless disregard to cause the victim's death or 
injury. The Motion for Acquittal was properly denied. State v. 
Meyers, 112 Hawai' i 278, 288, 145 P.3d 821, 831 (App. 2006).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Kekona argues his actions were justified by the
 
claim of defense of self and others and by choice of evils. 
Kekona testified he did not intend to cause the death or injury
 
of the victim, but fired the gun out of fear in order to scare
 
his alleged aggressor into retreating. Kekona also challenges
 
the credibility of the SOH's main witness against him.
 
Though Kekona presented evidence to support his 
defense, a "verdict based on conflicting evidence will not be set 
aside where there is substantial evidence to support the . . . 
findings." State v. Sua, 92 Hawai' i 61, 69, 987 P.2d 959, 967 
(1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Substantial evidence supports the verdict. It is for the jury to determine witness 
credibility and weight of evidence, not this court. State v. 
Bailey, 126 Hawai' i 383, 406, 271 P.3d 1142, 1165 (2012). 
(3) Kekona contends the circuit court erred in giving
 
jury instructions that were prejudicially insufficient,
 erroneous, inconsistent, misleading, and led to substantial
 
prejudice against him. Kekona argues the circuit court confused
 
the jury by providing instructions regarding the included
 
offenses of attempted assault in the first and second degree. On
 
the verdict sheet for Count I, the jury foreman marked the line
 
for "Reckless Endangering in the First Degree." On the same
 
form, the jury was to answer a special interrogatory only if the
 
jury found Kekona guilty of attempted murder or attempted
 
assault. On the form, the jury foreman marked the "Yes" line for
 
the interrogatory and wrote "N/A" and his initials next to the
 
mark. The circuit court clarified the markings with the jury
 
foreman and ensured the foreman understood that the interrogatory
 
was inapplicable based on the jury's unanimous decision to
 
convict Kekona of reckless endangerment. The jury foreman
 
confirmed there was no confusion as to which interrogatory
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
applied and the verdict reached by the jury demonstrated no
 
contradiction or confusion. 
Kekona argues the jury decision not to convict Kekona 
of attempted assault supports his contention that the court erred 
in providing the instruction. The evidence provided a rational 
basis to warrant instruction on attempted assault. The 
instruction was not in error. State v. Behrendt, 124 Hawai' i 90, 
109, 237 P.3d 1156, 1175 (2010); See also Dolan v. Hilo Med. 
Ctr., 127 Hawai' i 325, 343, 278 P.3d 382, 400 (App. 2012). 
(4) Kekona contends prosecutorial misconduct during
 
closing arguments denied him a fair trial.
 
Kekona asserts the SOH improperly attacked the
 
credibility of Kekona's counsel to undermine the credibility of
 
Kekona's witness. During closing arguments the SOH said, "But
 
most damning of all of [witness's] testimony is this. He spoke
 
with the defendant and his attorney before he spoke with the
 
police." Kekona objected to the statement and requested a
 
mistrial. The circuit court denied the request.
 
The SOH may "draw reasonable inferences from the 
evidence and wide latitude is allowed in discussing the 
evidence." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 
209 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the witness testified he spoke with Kekona and Kekona's counsel 
before speaking with police about the events at issue. It is not 
prosecutorial misconduct to challenge the credibility of a 
witness based on the testimony at trial. State v. Carvalho, 106 
Hawai'i 13, 17, 100 P.3d 607, 611 (App. 2004), cert. denied, 106 
Hawai'i 37, 100 P.3d 968 (2004). 
Kekona challenges SOH's closing argument regarding
 
fingerprint evidence on the record. During closing arguments,
 the SOH argued: 
When you look at [SOH's] Exhibit No. 67, you'll
clearly see the fingerprint card recovered by evidence
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
specialist . . . . Interior right rear passenger window.
That means the print is on the inside of the window and not
on the outside.
 
. . . It defies reason and common sense that [Kekona] put
his fingerprint on the interior of the window as he was leaning on
the outside of it.
 
The SOH's argument draws inferences from evidence on the record
 
and was not misleading or improper.
 
Kekona contends the SOH's repeated use of "I" during 
closing arguments improperly placed the SOH's personal opinion 
before the jury. Kekona takes issue with the phrases such as "I 
will explain" and "I ask you" as personal opinions. The SOH also 
said: "I will return to these points," "I shared with you," and 
"Plenty words I know." These types of phrases spoken by the SOH 
do contain the word "I", however, these statements do not 
constitute personal opinion. In State v. Marsh, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court deemed the statement "I'm sure she committed the crime," an improper assertion of personal opinion. State v. 
Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 660, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986). Similarly, in State v. Sanchez, the statement "I didn't see anybody," was 
deemed an improper assertion of personal opinion. State v. 
Sanchez, 82 Hawai' i 517, 534, 923 P.2d 934, 951 (App. 1996). In 
the instant case, the SOH's use of the word "I" does not refer to 
any personal opinion and is not improper. 
Kekona contends the SOH improperly raised his prior
 
conviction to improperly attack his character. During closing
 
arguments the SOH said, "On that day they meet up with yet
 
another convicted felon[.]" Kekona objected to the comment and
 
requested a mistrial. The circuit court overruled the objection
 
and denied the request. Kekona had previously stipulated into
 
evidence that he was a convicted felon.
 
Assuming arguendo that the statement was improper, it
 
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the evidence
 
supporting Kekona's conviction. Kekona admitted he fired a
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
firearm at the victim's vehicle knowing the victim was still 
inside. Kekona stipulated to possessing a firearm despite his 
prior conviction. The SOH's comments did not adversely prejudice 
Kekona's right to a fair trial. See e.g., State v. Ganal, 81 
Hawai'i 358, 377, 917 P.2d 370, 389 (1996); State v. Knight, 80 
Hawai'i 318, 327, 909 P.2d 1133, 1142 (1996). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence (Counts I and III) Notice of Entry," entered
 December 20, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 
affirmed.
