SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Donald B. Marks (Marks), appearing
 
pro se, appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
and Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 Judgment, Without a Hearing" (Order Denying Second Rule 40
 Petition) that was filed on January 3, 2011, in the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
In his underlying criminal case, Marks pleaded no 
contest to second-degree murder. Respondent-Appellee State of 
Hawai» i (State) moved that Marks be sentenced to an extended term 
of imprisonment as a persistent offender. The Circuit Court 
granted the State's motion and sentenced Marks to life 
imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Circuit 
1 The Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall presided.

Court entered its judgment of conviction and sentence on November
 
8, 2004. Marks did not file a direct appeal of his conviction or
 sentence. 
On September 27, 2005, Marks filed his first "Petition 
for Post-Conviction Relief" pursuant to Hawai» i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (First Rule 40 Petition). Marks alleged that his counsel had been ineffective for failing to object to and appeal his extended term sentence as illegal under Apprendi 
v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Blakely v. Washington,
 542 U.S. 296 (2004). The Circuit Court issued its order denying
 Marks's First Rule 40 Petition on May 9, 2006. Marks filed a
 notice of appeal from the order denying his First Rule 40
 Petition. However, Marks's appeal was subsequently dismissed by
 
this court because Marks failed to file an opening brief. 
On November 13, 2009, Marks filed his second "Petition
 
for Post-Conviction Relief" pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 (2006)
 (Second Rule 40 Petition). Marks was also permitted to
 supplement his Second Rule 40 Petition with additional grounds
 for relief. On January 3, 2011, the Circuit Court denied Marks's
 Second Rule 40 Petition, as supplemented, by filing its Order
 Denying Second Rule 40 Petition. 
II.
 
On appeal, Marks argues: (1) his counsel provided 
ineffective assistance by failing to object to and appeal his extended term sentence under Apprendi  and Blakely; (2) his 
extended term sentence was invalid, where the court, and not a jury, made the findings necessary for the extended term sentence 
and because the extended term statute under which he was sentenced was void ab initio under State v. Maugaotega , 115 
Hawai» i 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007) (hereinafter, "Maugaoteqa II "); 
(3) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct and violated the terms
 of the State's plea agreement by moving for an extended term of
 
imprisonment; (4) the indictment was defective for failing to
 
allege facts necessary to warrant an extended term of
 
imprisonment; (5) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in not
 
2
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appointing counsel to assist in his Second Rule 40 Petition; and
 
(6) the Circuit Court erred in denying his Second Rule 40
 Petition without a hearing. 
We resolve Marks's arguments on appeal as follows:
 1. We reject Marks's claim that his counsel provided 
ineffective assistance by failing to object to and appeal Marks's extended term sentence under Apprendi  and Blakely. Marks is 
barred from raising this claim because it was previously raised, ruled upon, and denied in connection with his First Rule 40 Petition. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). But even if we consider Marks's claim on the merits, he is not entitled to any relief. Prior to its 2007 decision in Maugaoteqa II , the Hawai» i Supreme Court had 
steadfastly held that Hawai» i's extended term sentencing scheme 
complied with Apprendi  and Blakely. See Maugaotega II, 115 
Hawai» i at 437 42, 168 P.3d at 567 72; State v. Rivera, 106 
Hawai» i 146, 156-64, 102 P.3d 1044, 1054-62 (2004); Loher v. 
State, 118 Hawai» i 522, 536, 193 P.3d 438, 452 (App. 2008). 
Marks's counsel was not ineffective for failing to object at 
Marks's sentencing and to pursue an appeal on grounds that were contrary to controlling precedent of the Hawai» i Supreme Court. 
2. We reject Marks's attempt to collaterally attack 
his extended term sentence. Marks's extended term sentence was valid when his conviction and sentence became final, and therefore, Marks is not entitled to collaterally attack his sentence on the ground that a judge, and not a jury, made the findings necessary for the extended term sentence. Loher, 118 Hawai» i at 534 38, 193 P.3d at 450 54; see State v. Gomes, 107 
Hawai» i 308, 312 14, 113 P.3d 184, 188 90 (2005); United States 
v. Cruz, 423 F.3d 1119, 1120 21 (9th Cir. 2005). In addition, 
contrary to Marks's claim, the extended term statute under which his sentence was imposed was not rendered void ab initio by Maugaotega II . See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai» i 381, 386 89, 
406 15, 184 P.3d 133, 138 41, 158 67 (2008); State v. Cutsinger , 
118 Hawai» i 68, 79 82, 185 P.3d 816, 827 830 (App. 2008), 
overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai» i at 398

n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; Loher , 118 Hawai» i at 534 38, 193 
P.3d at 450 54. 
3. Marks's claim that the prosecutor engaged in
 
misconduct and violated the terms of the State's plea agreement
 
by moving for an extended term of imprisonment is conclusively
 refuted by the record. Marks's own statements at his change of
 plea hearing belie his claim of a purported plea agreement in
 which the State agreed not to seek an extended term. At the
 change of plea hearing, Marks acknowledged his understanding that
 the State may file a motion for an extended term of imprisonment
 and that if the Circuit Court were to grant such motion, he could
 be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of
 parole. Marks also informed the Circuit Court that he did not
 
have any plea agreement with the State and that no promises had
 been made to him to induce him to plead no contest to the second-
degree murder charge. 
Moreover, the letter from the State that Marks relies
 
upon to support his claim that the State had agreed not to move
 for an extended term actually serves to contradict his claim. In
 the letter, the State plainly indicates to Marks's counsel that
 it is moving for an extended term based on Marks's status as a
 persistent offender, but that it will not be seeking an extended
 term based on Marks's dangerousness. The State's letter does not
 reflect any agreement not to move for an extended term. The
 State moved that Marks be sentenced to an extended term as a
 persistent offender, and the Circuit Court granted the State's
 motion on that ground. Marks's claim that his extended term of
 
imprisonment was the result of prosecutorial misconduct or the
 State's breach of a plea agreement is without merit.
 
4. Marks's reliance on Jess  to support his claim that
 
the indictment was defective for failing to allege facts
 necessary to warrant an extended term of imprisonment is
 
misplaced. The court in Jess  held that the new charging rule it
 
was announcing would only apply prospectively to charging
 instruments filed after the date of the decision. Jess, 117
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai» i at 398-404, 184 P.3d at 150-156. Because Marks's 
indictment was filed long before the Jess  decision, the new 
charging rule announced in Jess  did not apply to Marks's case, 
and Marks's challenge to the validity of his indictment is 
unavailing. 
5. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Marks's 
Second Rule 40 Petition failed to show a colorable claim for relief. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in denying Marks's request for appointment of counsel and in denying his Second Rule 40 Petition without a hearing. See HRPP Rule 40(f) 
and (i); Dan v. State , 76 Hawai» i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 
(1994).

We affirm the Order Denying Second Rule 40 Petition
 
entered by the Circuit Court.
