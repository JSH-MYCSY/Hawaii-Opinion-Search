NO. CAAP-11-0000037
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
JUANA MARIA KERR, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
GILBERT SILVA, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1SS10-1-00840)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Petitioner-Appellant Juana
 
Kerr (Appellant) has asserted from a December 23, 2010 entry in
 the district court minutes that appears to reflect the Honorable
 Steven M. Nakashima's oral announcement that he intends to
 dismiss the district court case, because the district court has
 not yet entered an appealable written order or appealable written
 judgment that dismisses the district court case.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant is appealing pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure provides that "[a] judgment or order is entered when it 
is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." A district court's "oral decision is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. 
Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005). Although 
court minutes might reflect a court's oral announcement of a ruling, "a minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. 
Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 
P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis added). "In civil cases before the district court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; and 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the judgment is not effective before such entry." KNG Corp. v. 
Kim, 107 Hawai 'i at 77, 110 P.3d at 401 (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted); cf State v. Bohannon, 102 
Hawai'i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003) ("Accordingly, we hold 
that, in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."). 
On May 4, 2011, the record on appeal for Appeal No.
 
CAAP-11-0000037 was filed, at which time the record on appeal did
 not contain any written order or written judgment that ended this
 case, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated. Absent an
 appealable written order or appealable written judgment that ends
 this case, Appellant's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP­
11-0000037 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
