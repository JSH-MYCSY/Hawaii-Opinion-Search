JUANA MARIA KERR, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
GILBERT SILVA, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1SS10-1-00840)
 
ORDER DENYING JULY 14, 2011 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION
TO RECONSIDER JUNE 29, 2011 ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the June 29, 2011 order dismissing
 
Petitioner-Appellant Juana Kerr's (Appellant) appeal in Appeal
 
No. CAAP-11-0000037, (2) Appellant's July 14, 2011 motion to
 reconsider the June 29, 2011 order dismissing the appeal, and 
(3)
 the record, it appears that Appellant's July 14, 2011 motion 
for reconsideration is untimely pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
"A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party
 
only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion,

dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional
 
time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the
 appellate court involved." HRAP Rule 40(a). Appellant did not
 file the July 14, 2011 motion for reconsideration within ten days
 after the filing of the June 29, 2011 order dismissing the
 appeal, as HRAP Rule 40(a) requires. Therefore, Appellant's July
 14, 2011 motion for reconsideration is untimely under HRAP Rule
 40(a).
 
Accordingly, Appellant's July 14, 2011 motion for
 
reconsideration of the June 29, 2011 order dismissing the appeal
 is denied.
