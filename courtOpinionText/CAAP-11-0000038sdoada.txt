STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FELICIA M. STELLFLUG, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2DTA-10-00693)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., and Ginoza, J.;
Fujise, J., dissenting)
 
Defendant-Appellant Felicia M. Stellflug (Stellflug)
 
appeals from the Judgment entered on December 29, 2010 in the
 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (district
 
court).1
 
The district court found Stellflug guilty of Operating
 
a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2009) (OVUII).
 
On appeal, Stellflug contends, and the State of Hawai' i 
(State) agrees, the district court erred by (1) admitting the 
results of a horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test into evidence

and such error was not harmless and (2) denying her request to
 
stay her sentence pending appeal.
 
We agree that the results of the HGN test were 
erroneously admitted into evidence because the State did not 
elicit testimony to lay the required foundation. State v. 
Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i 388, 397, 15 P.3d 314, 323 (App. 2000). The 
remaining question is whether this error was harmless. 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(a) 
provides, in relevant part, that "[a]ny error, defect, 
irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights 
shall be disregarded." The Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated that 
"[s]uch error, however, should not be viewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract. It must be examined in light 
of the entire proceedings and given the effect to which the whole 
record shows it is entitled." State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 
312, 320, 55 P.3d 276, 284 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets in original omitted). Under the harmless 
error standard, the appellate court "must determine whether there 
is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might 
have contributed to the conviction." State v. Pauline, 100 
Hawai'i 356, 378, 60 P.3d 306, 328 (2002) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). "If there is such a reasonable 
possibility in a criminal case, then the error is not harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judgment of conviction on 
which it may have been based must be set aside." State v. Gano, 
92 Hawai' i 161, 176, 988 P.2d 1153, 1168 (1999) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
In the instant case, there is more than a reasonable
 
possibility that the error complained of might have contributed
 
to the conviction. The district court judge expressly relied on
 
the results of the HGN in finding Stellflug guilty of OVUII. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment entered on
 
December 29, 2010 in the District Court of the First Circuit,

Wailuku Division, is vacated and this case is remanded for
 
further proceedings. We decline to address Stellflug's other
 
point as it is moot.
