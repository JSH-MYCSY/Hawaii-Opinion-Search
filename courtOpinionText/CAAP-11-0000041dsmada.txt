NO. CAAP-11-0000041
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
FIRST HAWAIIAN BANK, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ANTONIO RIVERA, JR., PHIDELIA RIVERA, et al.,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-01-264K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/ 
Appellants Antonio Rivera, Jr., and Phidelia Rivera's (the Rivera 
Appellants) appeal from the Honorable Ronald Ibarra's February 9, 2011 judgment, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because the February 9, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or
 
decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner
 . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). 
"Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP
 Rule 58. "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders
 have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered
 in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to
 HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id.
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4.
 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does 
not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although this case involves multiple claims in
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee First Hawaiian Bank's
 complaint and the Rivera Appellants' amended counterclaim (with
 four separate counts), the February 9, 2011 judgment does not
 specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit
 court intends to enter judgment. The February 9, 2011 judgment
 also does not expressly dismiss any unidentified claims. 
Although the February 9, 2011 judgment refers to a summary
 judgment order, it is not possible to discern whether the summary
 judgment order resolves one claim, two claims, or all of the
 parties' claims unless one would search through the voluminous
 record on appeal and read the summary judgment order. By merely
 entering judgment with a vague reference to a summary judgment
 order (instead of specifically identifying the claims on which
 the circuit court intends to enter judgment), the February 9,
 2011 judgment fails to sufficiently identify the claim or claims
 on which the February 9, 2011 judgment enters judgment in this
 multiple-claim case. The February 9, 2011 judgment is too vague
 to satisfy requirements for an appealable judgment in a multiple-
claim case under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent
 the entry of an appealable final judgment, this appeal is
 premature. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is

dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
