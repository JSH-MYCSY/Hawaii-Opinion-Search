IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS
OF ILIKAI APARTMENT BUILDING, Petitioner-Appellee, 
v.
SVC-HAWAII, L.P.; SVC-WAIKIKI, LLC; 
and SHELL OWNERS ASSOCIATION-HAWAII, Respondents-Appellants
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0303)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, we lack jurisdiction over
Respondents-Appellants SVC-Hawaii, L.P., SVC-Waikiki, LLC, and
Shell Owners Association-Hawaii's (the Appellants) appeal from
the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's December 16, 2010 "Order
Granting 'Petitioner's Motion to Compel Arbitration' Filed
September 21, 2010" (the December 16, 2010 order compelling
arbitration) because, under the circumstances of this special
proceeding, the December 16, 2010 order compelling arbitration isNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-28(a)(1) (Supp.
2010) authorizes an appeal from an order denying a motion to
compel arbitration:not yet eligible for appellate review, and the Appellants' appeal
is premature.
§ 658A-28. Appeals.
(a)  An appeal may be taken from: 
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration; 
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration;  
(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an
award;  
(4) An order modifying or correcting an award;
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or 
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  An appeal under this section shall be taken as from an order
or a judgment in a civil action. 
 
  
 
HRS § 658A-28 (emphasis added).  However, HRS § 658A-28(a) does
not authorize an appeal from an order granting a motion to compel
arbitration.  Therefore, the December 16, 2010 order compelling
arbitration is not appealable pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a).
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010) authorizes appeals
to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgments,
orders, or decrees.  However, appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be
taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court."  HRS
§ 641-1(c).  Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a
separate document."  HRCP Rule 58.  Based on HRCP Rule 58,  "[a]n
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced
to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of andNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119,
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  "An appeal from an order that is not
reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time
the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed."  Id.
at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted).  The circuit court
has not yet entered a final judgment in this case.  Therefore,
the December 16, 2010 order compelling arbitration is not yet
eligible for appellate review under HRS § 641-1(a).
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay
doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the December 16, 2010
order compelling arbitration does not satisfy all of the
requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the
collateral order doctrine.  See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai #i 18,
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for
appealability under the Forgay doctrine) and Abrams v. Cades,
Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai #i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under
the collateral order doctrine).  
We note in particular that, under the collateral order
doctrine, "[a]n order granting a motion to compel arbitration is
final and appealable" under circumstances when such an order "is
one of that small category of orders which finally determine
claims of right separable from and collateral to, rights asserted
in the action, too important to be denied review and too
independent of the cause itself to require that appellateNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated." 
Sher v. Cella, 114 Hawai #i 263, 266-67, 160 P.3d 1250, 1253-54
(App. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)
(emphasis added).  In Sher v. Cella, the parties were litigating a
complaint that contained six counts: (1) misrepresentation and non-
disclosure, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach of duty of good
faith and fair dealing, (4) negligence, (5) deceptive trade
practices, and (6) unjust enrichment.  Id. at 266, 160 P.3d at
1253.  Thus, when the circuit court entered an order granting a
motion to compel arbitration of these causes of action, we held
that, under the collateral order doctrine, the "order granting
[the] motion to compel arbitration is final and appealable[.]"  Id.
at 266-67, 160 P.3d at 1253.  
In contrast to Sher v. Cella, the December 16, 2010 order
compelling arbitration in the instant case is not separable from,
and collateral to, the merits of the claim that Petitioner-Appellee
Association of Apartment Owners of Ilikai Apartment Building
(Appellee AOAO Ilikai Apartment Building) sought in the document
through which it initiated the special civil proceeding in S.P. No.
10-1-0303, namely Appellee AOAO Ilikai Apartment Building's
September 21, 2010 motion to compel arbitration.  On the contrary,
the December 16, 2010 order compelling arbitration directly
addresses the merits of the claim in S.P. No. 10-1-0303. 
Therefore, the December 16, 2010 order compelling arbitration does
not satisfy the second requirement for the collateral order
doctrine, that the order must resolve an important issue completely
separate from, and collateral to, the merits of the action. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-5-Accordingly, under the circumstances of the instant case, the
December 16, 2010 order compelling arbitration is not appealable
under the collateral order doctrine.
Finally, the circuit court has not certified the December
16, 2010 order compelling arbitration for an interlocutory appeal
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2010).  Therefore, the
December 16, 2010 order compelling arbitration is not appealable
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b).
Under the circumstances of the special civil proceeding
in S.P. No. 10-1-0303, the December 16, 2010 order compelling
arbitration is not eligible for appellate review until the circuit
court enters a separate judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 58.  In
their statement of jurisdiction, Appellants contend without
explanation or citing authority that “[i]f a final judgment is
entered in this matter, it would only be after the arbitration is
concluded.”  We do not agree.  See HRCP Rule 58; Rule 23 of the
Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai #i.  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000044 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 7, 2011.
