GODFREY YOUNG and TRUDY YOUNG,
Appellants-Appellants,
v. 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES,
Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIV.
 NO. 09-01-1538)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Appellants-Appellants Godfrey 
Young and Trudy Young have asserted from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's January 10, 2011 judgment, because the January 10, 2010 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010), Rule 58 and Rule 72(k) of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
When a circuit court adjudicates an appeal from an 
administrative agency order, "[r]eview of any final judgment of 
the circuit court under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." HRS § 91-15 (1993). The Hawai' i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (1993 & Supp. 2010). Under Hawai' i law, "[a]ppeals 
shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). 
HRCP Rule 72(k) similarly requires that, upon a circuit court's adjudication of an administrative appeal, "the court having jurisdiction shall enter judgment." HRCP Rule 72(k). Therefore, the separate judgment document rule under the holding in Jenkins applies to a secondary appeal from a circuit court order that adjudicates an administrative appeal. See, e.g., Raquinio v. 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nakanelua,  77 Hawai' i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We 
conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth 
in 
Jenkins apply to appeals from circuit court orders deciding 
appeals from orders entered by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations."). When explaining the requirements for an appealable judgment under the separate document rule, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves
on its face all of the issues in the case, the
burden of searching the often voluminous circuit
court record to verify assertions of
jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither
 the parties nor counsel have a right to cast
upon this court the burden of searching a
voluminous record for evidence of finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[W]e should not make such searches necessary by allowing the 
parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as 
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis 
added). 
Although the circuit court reduced its January 10, 2011 
"Order Granting Appellee Department of Human Services' Motion for Leave to Present Additional Evidence and Remanding for New Hearing" to a separate judgment, the January 10, 2011 judgment does not expressly enter judgment in favor of and against the appropriate parties, as the holding in Jenkins requires for an appealable judgment. Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. Instead, the January 10, 2011 judgment ambiguously 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declares that judgment is entered, and the January 10, 2011 
judgment does not refer to any parties. Although the January 10, 2011 judgment contains a statement that declares that there are no further issues remaining in this case, the Supreme Court of Hawai'i has explained that, 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other
outstanding claims" is not a judgment. If the
 circuit court intends that claims other than
 those listed in the judgment language should be
dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or
"Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-
Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
 
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added).
 
Because the January 10, 2011 judgment neither
 
(a)
 enters judgment in favor of and against the appropriate
 
parties nor (b) expressly dismisses all parties' claims, the
 
January 10, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for
 an appealable final judgment under HRCP Rule 58, HRCP Rule 72(k),
 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment,
 this appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 22, 2011.
