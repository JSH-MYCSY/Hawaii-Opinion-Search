OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(PROBATE NO. 09-1-0309)
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: (1) on
 
January 24, 2011, a party filed a document entitled Petitioner-
Appellant Request for Extension on Reply Brief; (2) the caption
 on the document shows that it should have been filed in Appeal
 No. 30647, but the filing party, by mistake, initiated a new
 appeal - CAAP-11-0000047; and (3) apart from the document filed
 on January 24, 2011, no other documents have been filed in 
CAAP-11-0000047.

1. The appellate clerk shall file Petitioner-Appellant
 
Request for Extension on Reply Brief in the correct appeal.
 
2. CAAP-11-0000047 is dismissed and the appellate
 
clerk shall close CAAP-11-0000047.
