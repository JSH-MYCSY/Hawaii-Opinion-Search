1
Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court),  convicting him of
two counts of Continuing Sexual Assault Against a Minor Under the
 
Age of Fourteen in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
2
§ 707-733.5 (Supp. 2005)  and three counts of Sexual Assault in
the Third Degree against a minor under fourteen in violation of

 In relevant part, HRS § 707-733.5 states, "(1) Any person who: (a)
[e]ither resides in the same home with a minor under the age of fourteen years
or has recurring access to the minor; and (b) [e]ngages in three or more acts
of sexual penetration or sexual contact with the minor over a period of time,
but while the minor is under the age of fourteen years, is guilty of the
offense of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen
years."

 HRS § 707-732(1)(b) states, "(1) A person commits the offense of
sexual assault in the third degree if . . . (b) [t]he person knowingly
subjects to sexual contact another person who is less than fourteen years old
or causes such a person to have sexual contact with the person."

Transfiguracion asserts two points of error, asking the 
court to vacate his convictions and remand his case for a new 
trial. First, he argues that the circuit court erred in 
admitting the testimony of Dr. Alex Bivens (Dr. Bivens), the 
State of Hawai' i's (the State) expert witness, because it (a) was 
irrelevant, (b) not the proper subject of expert testimony as it did not assist the jury in comprehending something not commonly 
known or understood, (c) improperly bolstered the complainants' 
credibility and profiled Transfiguracion as a child molester, and 
(d) was not offered in compliance with Hawaii Rules of Evidence
 
(HRE) Rule 702 or 701. Second, Transfiguracion contends that the
 
circuit court erred in admitting an alleged prior bad act because
 
(a) the evidence was not relevant and (b) its admission
 
constituted an abuse of discretion pursuant to HRE Rules 403 and
 
404.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Transfiguracion's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1)(a) Each challenged aspect of Dr. Bivens's
 
testimony – i.e., his discussion of external statistics and case
 
studies – is relevant because it provided the jury with context
 
to evaluate the behavior of the minor complainants where the
 
normal indicia of reliability might not apply. See State v.
 
Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 557-58, 799 P.2d 48, 51-52 (1990); State
 v. Rinehart, 8 Haw. App. 638, 649, 819 P.2d 1122, 1128 (1991); 
State v. Moisa, 126 Hawai' i 266, 269 P.3d 801, No. 30712 2012 
WL 247963 at *2 (App. Jan. 25, 2012) (SDO) (approving Dr. Bivens's expert testimony in which he discussed studies and 
research relating to child sexual molestation). 
Transfiguracion's conclusory assertion that the testimony is not 
relevant does not explain why this case is distinct from these 
authorities. Accordingly, the court rejects Transfiguracion's 
argument that Dr. Bivens's discussion of external statistics and 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
case studies was irrelevant as to whether Transfiguracion
 
sexually abused the complainants.
 
(1)(b) Tranfiguracion argued to the circuit court that
 
Dr. Bivens's testimony was not relevant but focused on its
 
reliability and whether specific aspects of Dr. Bivens's report
 
addressed material myths or public misconceptions related to a
 
child's response to sexual abuse. It is only on appeal that
 
Transfiguracion first raises the issue of the continuing factual
 
vitality of Batangan's holding regarding the existence of myths
 
and public misconceptions related to a child's response to sexual
 
abuse. Regardless of the standard of review, Transfiguracion's
 
argument fails.
 
First, even if the circuit court were to credit
 
Transfiguracion's unsubstantiated assertion that the news and
 
entertainment media depict child sex abuse and delayed reporting
 
on a regular basis, it does not necessarily follow that there has
 
been any change in the public's understanding of the
 
psychological effects of childhood sexual abuse. Likewise, a
 
juror's exposure to childhood sexual abuse (whether through
 
personal or secondhand experience) does not necessarily imply
 
that a juror would not be aided by expert testimony that speaks
 
to the psychological effects of such experiences. Supporting the
 
point that there was no obvious error, courts routinely permit
 
expert testimony on the subjects covered by Dr. Bivens,
 
implicitly finding that the issues remain outside the common
 
understanding of a lay jury. See, e.g., Moisa, SDO at *2.
 
Second, Transfiguracion's requested relief -- a new
 
trial in which the trial court assesses the current social
 
backdrop in assessing the average juror's knowledge of child sex
 
abuse and the phenomenon of delayed disclosure -- highlights the
 
absence of facts upon which this court could base a decision
 
reversing the circuit court. In the civil context, courts in
 
this jurisdiction take into account whether consideration of the
 
issue not raised at trial requires additional facts when
 
determining whether to exercise their discretionary powers to
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
notice plain error. See State v. Fox, 70 Haw. 46, 56 n.2, 760
 
P.2d 670, 676 n.2 (1988). While this principle might have less
 
applicability in the criminal context, it must retain some force
 
for the rational, efficient functioning of the judiciary. 
Third, giving Transfiguracion a second bite at the
 
apple when he did not raise the specific issue below would
 
effectively require trial courts to sua sponte conduct HRE
 
Rule 104 hearings as to the current state of a lay jury's
 
knowledge about any subject upon which expert testimony was
 
proffered. Such a rule would be inconsistent with HRE Rule 102,
 
which provides that the "rules shall be construed to secure . . .
 
elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay." HRE Rule 102.
 
(1)(c) Transfiguracion did not demonstrate that
 
Dr. Bivens's testimony improperly bolstered the complainants'
 
credibility or profiled Transfiguracion as a child molester.
 
To the bolstering argument, in Batangan, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court recognized that expert testimony tends to bolster 
the credibility of one witness over another but that this alone 
does not make the evidence inadmissible. 71 Haw. at 558, 799 
P.2d at 52. Accordingly, here, the inquiry is not merely whether 
Dr. Bivens's testimony might have had a tendency to bolster the 
complainants' testimony but, instead, whether Dr. Bivens's 
testimony drew inferences and conclusions from the studies and 
connected them to the facts of the particular case in a manner 
that usurped the role of the jury. See id. Transfiguracion does 
not identify any place in the record in which Dr. Bivens testified about this particular case. To the contrary, Dr. 
Bivens explicitly stated that he had no knowledge about the facts 
of the case, was not there to vouch for the credibility of any of 
the witnesses, and was only there to give a general overview of 
the scientific literature on sexual abuse of children. This is 
quite unlike the testimony of the State's expert in Batangan, in 
which he was asked to evaluate the complainant's credibility and 
only minimally discussed general principles of social or 
behavioral science. See Batangan, 71 Haw. at 562, 799 P.2d at 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
54; cf. State v. Morris, 72 Haw. 527, 528-29, 825. P.2d 1051, 
1052 (1992) (finding error where expert witness opined that child 
in the case had been chronically sexually abused). Accordingly, 
Dr. Bivens's testimony did not usurp the role of the jury by 
improperly bolstering the credibility of the complainants. See 
Moisa, SDO at *2 (rejecting defendant's appeal where Dr. Bivens discussed studies and research relating to child sexual 
molestation but defendant failed to cite any evidence that Dr. 
Bivens offered an opinion regarding the complainant or that Dr. 
Bivens's testimony served to improperly bolster the complainant's 
credibility); State v. Behrendt, 121 Hawai' i 260, 218 P.3d 387, 
No. 29191 2009 WL 3653563 at *2 (App. Nov. 4, 2009) (SDO) (approving Dr. Bivens's testimony and noting that it could be 
distinguished from the testimony at issue in Batangan because 
Dr. Bivens never endorsed the complainant's version of events but 
merely opined on general conclusions drawn from studies of sexual 
abuse). 
Moreover, the effect of adopting Transfiguracion's
 
argument would be to hold that, if the alleged behavior of a
 
defendant in a sexual abuse case involving a minor is consistent
 
with the findings of general scientific studies on child
 
molesters, then expert testimony on those studies is
 
impermissible. Such a proposition is inconsistent with the
 
controlling case law of this jurisdiction. Id.
 
Transfiguracion also fails to demonstrate that
 
Dr. Bivens's testimony improperly profiled Transfiguracion as a
 
child molester. First, Transfiguracion misstates the record. 
The circuit court did not agree that Dr. Bivens's testimony had
 
the effect of profiling Transfiguracion by comparing him to a
 
prototypical offender. Rather, the circuit court asked the State
 
if that was the argument that it was trying to make. Second, the
 
testimony had legitimate purposes, including educating the jury
 
about common practices of child molesters that might explain
 
delayed reporting on the part of the victims. See Batangan, 71
 
Haw. at 557-58, 799 P.2d at 51-52; see also Oregon v. Stafford,
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
157 Or. App. 445, 454, 972 P.2d 47, 52 (Or. Ct. App. 1998)
 
(permitting use of expert testimony about grooming behavior as
 
relevant to issue of defendant's intent); Hernandez v. Texas, 973
 
S.W.2d 787, 790 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (permitting use of expert
 
testimony regarding grooming to show plan, preparation,
 
opportunity, an absence of mistake). Third, Dr. Bivens did not
 
explicitly draw any connections between Transfiguracion's
 
behavior and the findings of the study, which would be a clear
 
indication that the jury had been invited to profile
 
Transfiguracion as a sex offender. Fourth, Transfiguracion
 
points to no evidence that the jury actually employed the
 
checklist method other than its ultimate decision. 
Transfiguracion's argument fails because the fact that the jury
 
convicted Transfiguracion does not, as a matter of logical
 
necessity, imply that the jury used Dr. Bivens's testimony as a
 
checklist of behaviors that profiled Transfiguracion as a child
 
molester. The jury's ultimate decision might not have been based
 
on Dr. Bivens's testimony at all given that the minor
 
complainants testified as to Transfiguracion's charged conduct.
 
Also, again, given the record evidence, to credit 
Transfiguracion's argument would effectively create a rule that 
bars expert testimony about general characteristics of offenders, 
which is not consistent with the relevant case law. See 
generally State v. Machado, 109 Hawai' i 424, 434-35, 127 P.3d 84, 
94-95 (App. 2005) (approving admission of expert testimony that 
consistently referred to men as batterers and women as victims in 
a domestic abuse case); see also Behrendt, SDO at *2 (holding, 
under the plain error standard, that Dr. Bivens's testimony did 
not amount to a profiling of defendant as a sex offender where 
Dr. Bivens conceded on cross-examination that there was no 
scientific way to identify a sexual abuser and the State merely 
referenced Dr. Bivens's testimony to explain the progression of 
abuse that developed between the defendant and complainant). 
Instead, the key is to examine whether such testimony is being 
offered as substantive evidence of a defendant's innocence or 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
guilt or if it has an alternate, legitimate use (e.g., providing
 
necessary background for direct evidence). See generally U.S. v.
 
Lui, 941 F.2d 844, 847-48 (9th Cir. 1991) (discussing use of drug
 courier profile). And, in this case, there is nothing in the
 
record to suggest that Dr. Bivens's testimony was offered as
 
substantive evidence of Transfiguracion's guilt while, on the
 
other hand, it had legitimate uses.
 
Transfiguracion's arguments that Dr. Bivens's testimony
 
bolstered the complainants' credibility or profiled him as a sex
 
offender both ultimately go to whether Dr. Bivens's testimony was
 
more prejudicial than probative. To this more general notion,
 
Transfiguracion also contends that Dr. Bivens's testimony
 
regarding a study involving incomplete disclosure further
 
inflamed the passions and prejudices of the jury against
 
Transfiguracion because the statements might have created the
 
impression that the complainants had not disclosed the full
 
extent of the abuse. Transfiguracion argues that there was no
 
offsetting probative value because the comments did not explain
 
why child abuse victims delay disclosure or make the ultimate
 
issue in the case more or less likely.
 
To reiterate, as discussed above, Dr. Bivens' testimony
 
did not improperly bolster the complainants' credibility or
 
profile Transfiguracion as a sex offender. In addition, the
 
issue of incomplete disclosure fits with delayed reporting and
 
inconsistency in that it provides the jury with context to
 
evaluate the behavior of the minor complainants where the normal
 
indicia of reliability might not apply. See generally Batangan,
 
71 Haw. at 557-58, 799 P.2d at 51-52. Thus, the circuit court
 did not commit reversible error by permitting Dr. Bivens's
 
testimony after implicitly balancing its probative value and its
 
prejudicial effect. See generally State v. Iaukea, 56 Haw. 343,
 
349, 537 P.2d 724, 729 (1975) ("The responsibility for
 maintaining the delicate balance between probative value and
 
prejudicial effect lies largely within the discretion of the
 
trial court.").
 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1)(d) Rule 701 restricts a lay witness from offering
 
opinions other than those which are "rationally based on the
 
perception of the witness" and "helpful to a clear understanding
 
of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in
 
issue." HRE Rule 701. The State does not contend that Dr.
 
Bivens's testimony was admissible under HRE Rule 701. Rule 702
 
provides for the admission of expert testimony where "scientific,
 
technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier
 
of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in
 
issue" and the witness is "qualified as an expert by knowledge,
 
skill, experience, training, or education."
 
It is only on appeal that Transfiguracion argues that 
Dr. Bivens's testimony was improper because he was not formally 
qualified as an expert by the circuit court. However, 
Transfiguracion does not question whether Dr. Bivens's 
credentials qualify him as an expert or whether his methods are 
inadequate. Additionally, Dr. Bivens's testimony demonstrated 
that he was an expert by virtue of his knowledge, skill, 
experience, training, or education. Moreover, Dr. Bivens has 
been qualified an expert in this state. See, e.g., State v. 
Behrendt, 124 Hawai' i 90, 105-106, 237 P.3d 1156, 1171-1172 
(2010); State v. Silver, 123 Hawai' i 299, 233 P.3d 719, No. 29060 
2010 WL 2637778 at *12 (App. Jun. 30, 2010) (mem.), judgment affirmed in relevant part, 125 Hawai' i 1, 2, 249 P.3d 1141, 1142 
(2011). Given these factors, any error in allowing Dr. Bivens's testimony without formally qualifying him as an expert did not 
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the 
judicial proceedings. See State v. Metcalfe, No. 30518, 2012 WL 
1071503, at *3-*6 (App. Mar. 30, 2012), certiorari granted, No. SCWC-30518, 2012 WL 3217676 (Aug. 8, 2012). 
Transfiguracion's reliance on State v. Torres, 122 
Hawai'i 2, 222 P.3d 409 (App. 2009), is misplaced. First, in 
Torres, the defendant objected to the ostensible expert witness's qualifications prior to his testimony. 122 Hawai' i at 27 n.10, 
222 P.3d at 434 n.10. Here, it is only on appeal that 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Transfiguracion first raises the related issue as to whether 
Dr. Bivens needed to be formally qualified as an expert by the 
court. Second, the putative expert witness in Torres admitted 
that he lacked the necessary credentials and expertise to qualify 
as an expert. See id, at 31, 222 P.3d at 438, corrected on other 
grounds by, 125 Hawai' i 382, 262 P.3d 1006 (2011). As discussed 
above, Dr. Bivens has been found to have the necessary 
credentials and expertise to qualify as an expert. 
Moreover, if the court were to find in favor of
 
Transfiguracion, it would effectively be imposing a categorical
 
rule that the circuit court must formally qualify a witness as an
 
expert, even where no objection has been made and it is clear
 
that the circuit court has implicitly determined that a proffered
 
witness qualifies as an expert. Again, such an inflexible
 
approach seems inconsistent with HRE Rule 102. See HRE Rule 102;
 
see also Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152
 (1999) ("The trial court must have the same kind of latitude in
 
deciding how to test an expert's reliability, and to decide
 
whether or when special briefing or other proceedings are needed
 
to investigate reliability, as it enjoys when it decides whether
 
or not that expert's relevant testimony is reliable.") (emphasis
 
omitted); Ohio v. Frazier, 873 N.E.2d 1263, 1286-1287 (Ohio 2007)
 
(holding that state's failure to tender forensic scientist as
 
expert "was of no legal consequence" based on the expert's
 
qualifications); North Carolina v. Wise, 390 S.E.2d 142, 148
 
(N.C. 1990) (holding that a trial court's overruling of defense
 
counsel's objection to the opinion testimony constituted an
 
implicit finding that the witness was an expert).
 
(2)(a) Rule 404(b) of the HRE prohibits the use of 
evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts "to prove the character 
of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity 
therewith." As the Hawai' i Supreme Court explained, "[U]nder 
Rule 404(b), any purpose for which bad-acts evidence is introduced is a proper purpose so long as the evidence is not 
offered solely to prove character." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
289, 301, 926 P.2d 194, 206 (1996) (emphasis and citation
 
omitted). Accordingly, the inquiry here is whether there was a
 
permissible use for the evidence of Transfiguracion's uncharged
 
bad act, basically collapsing the HRE 404(b) and relevance
 
inquiry into one.
 
In the underlying proceeding, directly before Child 1
 
testified as to the uncharged prior bad act, the circuit court
 
instructed the jury that the evidence may only be considered on
 
the issue of motive and opportunity. In its final jury
 
instructions, the circuit court instructed the jury that the
 
evidence may only be used to prove motive, opportunity, or
 
intent. In both instances, the circuit court cautioned that the
 
testimony could not be considered as evidence of
 
Transfiguracion's bad character.
 
Child 1's testimony regarding Transfiguracion's
 
uncharged prior bad act was relevant because it helped to explain
 
why her sister, Child 2 (one of the complainants), delayed
 
reporting the abuse and why Transfiguracion called the police
 
when confronted by Child 2 (i.e., the testimony illustrated that
 
inappropriate touching was part of the household environment). 
See Oregon v. Hall, 814 P.2d 172, 175 (Or. Ct. App. 1991)
 
(approving admission of evidence that defendant had sexual
 
relations with mother of his two grandchildren who he was accused
 
of abusing because the evidence was relevant to explain the
 
delayed reporting by children).
 
The evidence also helps explain why Transfiguracion had 
the opportunity to engage in the charged acts without being 
reported. See Behrendt, 124 Hawai' i at 105-06, 237 P.3d at 1171­
72. Although Transfiguracion attempts to distinguish the instant
 
case from Behrendt by noting that the prior bad act in that case
 
involved the same complainants, that distinction is not
 
persuasive given that Child 1 and Child 2 were sisters and lived
 
in the same house, making them very similarly situated. See
 
Soper v. Alaska, 731 P.2d 587, 590-91 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987)
 (approving admission of testimony regarding prior bad acts where
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
complaining witness's sisters were allegedly seduced under
 
similar circumstances, noting that the witnesses had "highly
 
relevant common characteristics"); see also South Carolina v.
 
McClellan, 323 S.E.2d 772, 774 (S.C. 1984) (holding that
 
testimony from the complainant's sisters was admissible as
 
evidence of a common plan or scheme in trial for criminal sexual
 
conduct with a minor where all three sisters were attacked by
 
defendant beginning around their twelfth birthday, late at night,
 
at which time defendant quoted the same bible verse).
 
Following this same reasoning, Child 1's testimony 
regarding Transfiguracion's uncharged prior bad act also was 
legitimately related to motive. See State v. Torres, 85 Hawai' i 
417, 422, 945 P.2nd 849, 854 (App. 1997). The same pattern of behavior also arguably speaks to Transfiguracion's intent as the 
practice is consistent with the notion of grooming—an act that 
speaks to premeditation. See McClellan, 323 S.E.2d at 774. 
The circuit court did not err in admitting Child 1's
 
testimony of Transfiguracion's uncharged prior bad act because
 
the evidence was relevant and was not used for a purpose
 
prohibited by HRE Rule 404(b).
 
(2)(b) Rule 403, HRE, provides that relevant evidence
 
"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
 
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the
 
issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue
 
delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative
 
evidence." In assessing whether the evidence's "probative value
 
is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,"
 
courts employ a balancing test that considers factors such as:
 
the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the
other crime, the similarities between the crimes, the . . .
time that has elapsed between [them], the need for the
evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof, and the degree
to which the evidence probably will rouse the jury to
overmastering hostility.

(quoting E.W. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence § 190, at 565 (3d ed.
 
1984)).
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In its pre-trial order addressing the admission of 
testimony regarding Transfiguracion's uncharged prior bad acts, 
the circuit court undertook the appropriate HRE Rule 403 
balancing analysis. Transfiguracion presents no analysis or 
directly-applicable authorities for his contention that the 
circuit court's balancing was an abuse of discretion. On the 
other hand, the State and the circuit court articulate coherent 
reasons for the circuit court's conclusion that the ultimate 
balance between probative value and prejudicial effect tilted in 
favor of admitting Child 1's testimony regarding 
Transfiguracion's uncharged prior bad act, focusing on the 
contextual similarity of the act to the charged offenses, its 
probative value, and the less serious nature of the bad act 
(which, in turn, reduces its prejudicial effect). Accordingly, 
we conclude there was no reversible error in the circuit court's 
HRE Rule 403 balancing. See Torres, 85 Hawai' i at 423, 945 P.2d 
at 855 (finding no reversible error when review of case revealed circuit court's reasonable consideration of HRE Rule 403 
balancing factors). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 22, 2010 Final
 
Judgment and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the Third
 Circuit is affirmed.
