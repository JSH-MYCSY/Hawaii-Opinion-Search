IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRIST V. NGO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-1198)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Christ V. Ngo (Ngo) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence filed 
November 30, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1 2
(circuit court).   In a bench trial,  Ngo was convicted and found
 
guilty of "Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury,"
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-12 (2007
 
Repl.). Ngo was sentenced to five years' probation with
 
mandatory and special conditions.
 
On appeal, Ngo contends that:
 (1)
 The circuit court committed plain error and 
1
 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.
 
2
 The Honorable Michael A. Town presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violated Ngo's constitutional right to a trial before a fair and
 
impartial tribunal by its excessive questioning, eliciting
 
evidence upon which the circuit court specifically based its
 
finding of guilt. In the alternative, Ngo's trial counsel was
 
ineffective for failing to object to the circuit court's
 
excessive questioning.
 
(2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Ngo
 
under HRS § 291C-12 and HRS § 291C-14 (2007 Repl.) when Ngo
 
reported the accident "forthwith" to a police officer by turning
 
himself in twelve hours after the accident.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Ngo's
 
points of error as follows:
 
The circuit court did not err when it questioned Lance 
Fung Chen Pen (Lance) during the bench trial. Ngo contends the 
circuit court committed plain error by its "unduly extended, 
rigorous, and specific questioning" of Lance which "favored the 
prosecution[] and discredited the defense." Even though Ngo did 
not object to this line of questioning at trial, he asserts the 
questioning was not harmless and therefore constituted plain 
error reviewable by this court. Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 52(b). In the alternative, Ngo argues he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel when 
his counsel failed to object to the circuit court's excessive 
questioning. 
We review a circuit court's questioning of a witness at 
a bench trial for abuse of discretion. State v. Sprattling, 99 
Hawai'i 312, 317, 55 P.3d 276, 281 (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). Because Ngo did not object to the circuit 
court's questioning at trial, we review the alleged error under 
the plain error standard, which we only apply "to correct errors

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public 
reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, 
and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights." State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) (quoting 
State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998)). 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 614 provides that
 
the circuit court may interrogate witnesses.3 A trial judge's
 
right "to question witnesses has long been recognized as
 fundamental in the Anglo-American adversary system." Commentary
 
to HRE Rule 614(b)(1993) (citing McCormick, Evidence, § 8 (2d ed.
 
1972) and 9 Wigmore, Evidence § 2484 (3d ed. 1940)). In a jury
 
trial, the circuit court must exercise care in its interrogation
 
so as not to give rise to jury bias; but in a bench trial, the
 
circuit court "is accorded considerably greater discretion in the
 
questioning of witnesses." State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 326 n.8,
 
861 P.2d 11, 21 n.8 (1993). "In such cases, it is the judge who
 is the trier of fact, and, accordingly, there is no possibility
 
of jury bias; under the circumstances, the judge's duty to
 
clarify testimony and fully develop the truth in the case becomes
 
particularly heightened." Id. Also, although "it may be
 
improper for a judge to conduct an unduly extended examination of
 
any witness[,]" 81 Am. Jur. 2d Witnesses § 701 (2004), the
 
circuit court's examination of Lance only covered four pages of a
 
seventy-page transcript.
 
A careful review of the record reveals that the
 
examination merely served to clarify Lance's responses on direct
 
and cross-examination and to further elicit material facts. The
 
3
 HRE Rule 614 provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 614 Calling and interrogation of witness by court. (a)
Calling by court. The court may, on its own motion or at the
suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are
entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.
 
(b) Interrogation by court. The court may interrogate
witnesses, whether called by itself or a party.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court's questions confirmed that someone had told Lance 
at the Kapahulu Shell gas station (Shell station) that a person
 
had been run over. Further questions clarified who that
 
reporting person was, what he was doing at the Shell station, how
 
he knew someone got run over, and who heard the discussion.
 
"A trial judge has a duty to see that a fair trial is
 
at all times maintained and that the truth is brought forward so
 
that justice may prevail." Territory v. Van Culin, 36 Haw. 153,
 
161 (1942). "[A] trial judge has the right to examine witnesses
 to elicit pertinent material facts not brought out by either
 
party or to clarify testimony." Hutch, 75 Haw. at 327, 861 P.2d
 
at 21 (quoting State v. Schutter, 60 Haw. 221, 222, 588 P.2d 428,
 429 (1978)). Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not
 
abuse its discretion in its questioning of Lance.
 
Ngo argues in the alternative that his counsel was
 
ineffective for failing to object to the circuit court's
 
questioning of Lance. Because the circuit court's questioning
 
was not improper, counsel had no basis to object, so Ngo was not
 
denied his right to effective assistance of counsel.
 
The circuit court also did not err when it found 
sufficient evidence to convict Ngo when he did not report the 
accident "forthwith," in violation of HRS §§ 291C-12 and 291C-14. 
"The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a 
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to 
support the conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed, even if it 
could be said in a bench trial that the conviction is against the 
weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence 
to support the requisite findings for conviction, the trial court 
will be affirmed." State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-158, 
166 P.3d 322, 330-331 (2007). "And as trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable and rational inferences 
under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence." 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 249, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992). "An 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellate court will not pass upon the trial judge's decisions 
with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight of 
the evidence, because this is the province of the trial judge." 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996). 
HRS § 291C-12 sets forth in relevant part: 
§291C-12 Accidents involving death or serious bodily
injury. (a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an
accident resulting in serious bodily injury to or death of
any person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene
of the accident or as close thereto as possible but shall
then forthwith return to and in every event shall remain at
the scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the
 requirements of section 291C-14. Every such stop shall be
made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
HRS § 291C-14 provides in relevant part:
 
§291C-14 Duty to give information and render aid.
(a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident
resulting in injury to or death of any person or damage to
any vehicle or other property which is driven or attended by
any person shall give the driver's name, address, and the
registration number of the vehicle the driver is driving,
and shall upon request and if available exhibit the driver's
license or permit to drive to any person injured in the
accident or to the driver or occupant of or person attending
any vehicle or other property damaged in the accident and
shall give such information and upon request exhibit such
license or permit to any police officer at the scene of the
accident or who is investigating the accident and shall
render to any person injured in the accident reasonable
assistance[.]
 
(b) In the event that none of the persons specified
is in condition to receive the information to which they
otherwise would be entitled under subsection (a), and no
police officer is present, the driver of any vehicle
involved in the accident after fulfilling all other
requirements of section 291C-12, 291C-12.5, or 291C-12.6,
and subsection (a) of this section, insofar as possible on
the driver's part to be performed, shall forthwith report
the accident to the nearest police officer and submit
thereto the information specified in subsection (a).
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Black's Law Dictionary defines "forthwith" as: "1.
 
Immediately; without delay. 2. Directly; promptly; within a
 
reasonable time under the circumstances." Black's Law Dictionary
 
725 (9th ed. 2009).

Ngo contends that reporting the accident to the police
 
twelve hours later met the statutory requirement to report the
 
accident "forthwith." He argues that "forthwith" does not
 
require instantaneous action but instead, action "within a
 
reasonable time under the circumstances."
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that, 
when interpreting a statute, an appellate court's 
foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.
And where the language of the statute is plain and
unambiguous, [a court's] only duty is to give effect to [the
statute's] plain and obvious meaning.
 
State v. Wells, 78 Hawai' i 373, 376, 894 P.2d 70, 73 (1995) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in original 
omitted). "It is a basic rule of statutory interpretation that 
provisions of a penal statute will be accorded a limited and 
reasonable interpretation in order to preserve its overall 
purpose and to avoid absurd results." State v. Bayly, 118 
Hawai'i 1, 7, 185 P.3d 186, 192 (2008) (citation, brackets, and 
ellipsis omitted). 
Under Ngo's argument, "forthwith" could mean as long as
 
twelve hours later. Such an interpretation would lead to an
 
absurd result, where a driver involved in an accident could leave
 
the scene and not return for up to twelve hours to give
 
information and render aid, yet meet the requirements of HRS 
§§ 291C-12 and 291C-14. 
The circuit court did not err when it found there was
 
substantial evidence to support the conclusion that by the time
 
Ngo reached the Shell station, he knew he had run over someone
 
and he failed to report the accident to the police within a time
 
frame that would meet the requirements of HRS §§ 291C-12 and
 
291C-14 to report the accident "forthwith."
