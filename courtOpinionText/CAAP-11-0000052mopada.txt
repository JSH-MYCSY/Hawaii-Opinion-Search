IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
DARRYL D. PERRY, Appellant-Appellant,
v.
 
BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM,
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Appellee-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0891)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal of an administrative agency
 
decision, Petitioner-Appellant Darryl D. Perry (Perry) appeals
 
from the Final Judgment filed on March 24, 2011 in the Circuit
 
1
Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  The circuit court 
entered judgment in favor of Respondent-Appellee Board of 
Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of the State of 
Hawai'i (ERS) and against Perry pursuant to the circuit court's 
"Decision and Order Affirming Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Final Decision and Order of the [ERS]" (Decision and 
Order) filed on January 6, 2011. 
On appeal, Perry contends the circuit court erred by:
 (1) concluding that at the time of Perry's re­
employment on October 1, 2007 as Kaua
'i Chief of Police (police

chief), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 88-98 (Supp. 2007)
 
allowed ERS to suspend Perry's Honolulu Police Department (HPD)
 
retirement benefits while excluding Perry from earning further
 
retirement benefits as police chief;
 
(2) concluding that Perry was not entitled to earn
 
additional retirement benefits when ERS had (1) required him to
 
enroll as an ERS member, (2) suspended his HPD retirement
 
benefits, and (3) deducted ERS contributions from his paychecks
 
for two years;
 
(3) applying HRS § 88-98(c) (Supp. 2011) retroactively 
to Perry's retirement benefits because such application 
diminished or impaired Perry's accrued benefits, thus violating 
Perry's rights under article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution; 
(4) concluding that Perry waived his Contract Clause
 
claim under article I, section 10 of the United States
 Constitution because he did not raise this argument before ERS;
 
and
 
(5) concluding that the issue regarding ERS's
 
deductions from Perry's paychecks for two years was moot because
 
ERS committed to returning Perry's contributions with interest.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Perry retired from HPD on December 31, 2002 and began
 
collecting his retirement benefits. On October 1, 2007, Perry
 
returned to service as police chief. Perry re-enrolled as a
 
class B member of ERS as required under HRS §§ 88-47(a)(2) (Supp.
 
2	 3
2007) and 88-98(a) (Supp. 2007).  Pursuant to HRS § 88-98(a),
 
2
 HRS § 88-47 provides, in pertinent part:
 
(2) 	Class B shall consist of:
 
(A)	 Police officers and firefighters, including former
retirants who return to service in such capacity[.]
3
 HRS § 88-98(a) provides, in relevant part:
 
§88-98 Return to service of a retirant. (a) Any retirant
who returns to employment requiring active membership in the
system shall be reenrolled as an active member of the system in
the same class from which the retirant originally retired and the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ERS should have suspended Perry's retirement benefits from
 
October 1, 2007, but failed to do so until October 16, 2007.
 
In a letter dated February 29, 2008, ERS informed Perry of this
 
oversight and requested Perry reimburse ERS for the retirement
 
benefits ERS had inadvertently paid him. In this same letter,
 
ERS assured Perry that "any benefit you accrue during this new
 
membership will be calculated separately and added to your
 
pension amount."
 
Pursuant to HRS § 88-45 (Supp. 2010), Perry contributed
 
to the ERS annuity savings fund when he re-entered service as
 
police chief. ERS interpreted federal tax law to require that
 
any contributions collected from a member that could not be used
 
to provide a benefit to the member must be returned to the member
 
as excess contribution. In other words, if the member was not
 
entitled to accrue additional retirement benefits, ERS would have
 
to return those contributions to the member. 
retirant's retirement allowance shall be suspended.
 
(1)	 If the retirant returns to service before July 1,
1998, and again retires, the retirant's retirement
allowance shall consist of:
 
(A)	 For members with fewer than three years of
credited service during the member's
period of reemployment, the allowance to
which the member was entitled under the
 retirement allowance option selected when
the member previously retired and which
was suspended; plus, for the period of
service during the member's reemployment,
the allowance to which the member is
 entitled for that service based on the
 retirement allowance option initially
selected and computed for the member's
age, average final compensation, and other
factors in accordance with the benefit
 formula under section 88-74 in existence
 at the time of the member's latest
 retirement;
 .  .  .
 
(2) 	If the retirant returns to service after June 30,
1998, and again retires, the retirant's retirement
allowance shall be computed in accordance with
paragraph (1)(A), regardless of the number of years of
service in the reemployment period.

In a September 23, 2009 letter, ERS informed Perry that
 
when he returned to service on October 1, 2007, he had already
 
reached the 80% cap on his maximum retirement allowance and
 
therefore, was not eligible to accrue any additional retirement
 
benefits. ERS explained that in "the recent legislative session,
 
the Legislature adopted legislation confirming that retirants,
 
like you, who return to service after reaching the cap on maximum
 
retirement allowance and who there[fore] are not eligible to
 
accrue additional retirement benefits, do not have to pay
 
retirement contributions to [ERS]." Perry was told ERS would no
 
longer deduct contributions from his salary and would reimburse
 
him for contributions he had made since re-entering service.
 
Perry filed a Petition for Declaratory Order on October
 
15, 2009 challenging ERS's contention that he did not qualify for
 
additional retirement benefits. In response to e-mail inquires
 
from Perry, ERS sent a letter dated October 19, 2009 reiterating
 
its position that Perry was not entitled to additional retirement
 
benefits. ERS advised Perry of his right to appeal, which he did
 
on November 8, 2009 via a Statement of Appeal.
 
ERS and Perry stipulated to have ERS hear the matter by
 
written submission of the parties. ERS considered the case at
 
its HRS Chapter 91 meetings on February 8, 2010 and 
March 8, 2010. ERS entered its Findings of Facts, Conclusions of
 
Law, and Final Decision and Order (ERS Order) on March 23, 2010. 
Perry filed his appeal to the circuit court on April 26, 2010.
 
The circuit court heard the case on September 28, 2010.
 
On January 6, 2011, the circuit court entered its Decision and
 
Order Affirming [ERS Order] (January 6, 2011 Order). On January
 
26, 2011, Perry filed a notice of appeal from the January 6, 2011
 
Order. On March 24, 2011, the circuit court reduced the January
 
6, 2011 Order to a Final Judgment in favor of ERS and against
 
Perry.4

 Perry filed his January 26, 2011 notice of appeal prematurely, after
the circuit court filed the January 6, 2011 Order but before it entered the
March 24, 2011 Final Judgment. However, Perry's appeal is timely pursuant to

II. 	STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A.	 Secondary Appeal
 
"'Review of a decision made by a court upon its review
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal. The 
standard of review is one in which [the appellate] courtmust determine whether the court under review was right or
wrong in its decision.'" Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals of County 
of Hawaii, 109 Hawai' i 384, 391, 126 P.3d 1071, 1078 (2006)
(quoting Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai' i 
296, 306-07, 97 P.3d 372, 382-83 (2004) (other citation
omitted)). The standards as set forth in HRS § 91-14(g)
(1993) are applied to the agency's decision. Ka Pa�akai O 
Ka�aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai' i 31, 40, 7 P.3d 1068,
1077 (2000). HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
"'Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewableunder subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regardingprocedural defects under subsection (3); findings of factunder subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion
under subsection (6).'" Sierra Club v. Office of Planning, 
State of Hawai� i, 109 Hawai' i 411, 414, 126 P.3d 1098, 1101

Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229-30, 751 P.2d

agency's conclusions of law.'" Lanai Co., 105 Hawai' i at 
307, 97 P.3d at 383 (quoting Dole Hawaii Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71 Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118

B. Deference to Administrative Agency Decision
 
In determining whether an agency determination should
be given deference, the standard to be applied is as
follows:
 
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrative
agency, we first decide whether the legislature
granted the agency discretion to make the
determination being reviewed. If the legislature has
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then we review the agency's action pursuant to
the deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearing
in mind that the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion). If the legislature has not
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then the agency's conclusions are subject to
de novo review.

Practices, 116 Hawai' i 337, 344, 173 P.3d 484, 491 (2007). 
"[I]n deference to the administrative agency's
 
expertise and experience in its particular field, the courts
 
should not substitute their own judgment for that of the
 
administrative agency where mixed questions of fact and law are
 
presented. This is particularly true where the law to be applied
 
is not a statute but an administrative rule promulgated by the
 
same agency interpreting it." Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212,
 
216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984) (citations omitted).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C. Statutory Interpretation
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of
law that is reviewed de novo.
 
When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to
the intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself. And we must read
 statutory language in the context of the entire
statute and construe it in a manner consistent
 with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of
an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity
exists[.]
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context with which the ambiguous
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared,
in order to ascertain their true meaning.
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic
aids in determining legislative intent. One
 avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider
the reason and spirit of the law, and the cause
which induced the legislature to enact it [] to
discover its true meaning. Laws in pari
materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall
be construed with reference to each other. What
 is clear in one statute may be called upon in
aid to explain what is doubtful in another.
 
Morgan v. Planning Dep't, County of Kaua' i, 104 Hawai' i 173,
179-80, 86 P.3d 982, 988-89 (2004) (citations and internalquotation marks omitted). 
[W]here an administrative agency is charged with the
responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a
statute which contains words of broad and indefinite
 meaning, courts accord persuasive weight to
administrative construction and follow the same,
unless the construction is palpably erroneous.
 
Id. at 180, 86 P.3d at 989 (citing Ka Pa' akai O Ka ' Aina v. 
Land Use Comm'n, State of Hawai' i, 94 Hawai' i 31, 41, 7 P.3d
1068, 1078 (2000)). Stated differently: 
Where an agency is statutorily responsible for
carrying out the mandate of a statute which contains
broad or ambiguous language, that agency's
interpretation and application of the statute is
generally accorded judicial deference on appellate
review. Vail v. Employees' Retirement System, 75 Haw.
42, 59, 856 P.2d 1227, 1237 (1993). However, an
interpretation by an agency of a statute it
administers is not entitled to deference if the
 interpretation is plainly erroneous and inconsistent

with both the letter and intent of the statutory
mandate. Kahana Sunset Owners v. County of Maui, 86 
Hawai'i 66, 72, 947 P.2d 378, 384 (1997).

D. Legislative Intent
 
The appellate court "derives legislative intent
 
primarily from the language of statute and follows the general
 
rule that in the absence of clear legislative intent to the
 
contrary, the plain meaning of the statute will be given effect." 
State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992)

matter jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo." Hamilton

F. Constitutional Questions
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court stated in In re Guardianship 
of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 151 P.3d 717 (2007): 
[The appellate court] reviews questions of
constitutional law de novo under the right/wrong standard
and, thus, exercises its own independent constitutional
judgment based on the facts of the case. [The appellate
court] as a general matter, has long adhered to the
proposition that (1) legislative enactments are
presumptively constitutional; (2) a party challenging a
statutory scheme has the burden of showing
unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) the
constitutional defect must be clear, manifest, and
unmistakable.

III. DISCUSSION
 
5
Pursuant to HRS § 88-74 (Supp. 2010),  during Perry's
years of service as a police officer, he contributed 2.5% of each
 
paycheck into the ERS annuity fund that formed the basis of his
 
retirement allowance. 
A police officer's retirement allowance is
 
calculated as follows: average final compensation x years of
 credited service x 2.5%, provided the officer's maximum
 
retirement allowance does not exceed 80% of the officer's average
 
final compensation.
 
When Perry retired from HPD on December 31, 2002, 
he was credited with 32 years and 7 months (32.583 years)
 
of service. Based on service credit earned for actual
 
service, Perry exceeded the 80% benefit cap
 
(32.583
 years x 2.5% = 81.458%).
 
5
 HRS § 88-74 provides, in relevant part:
 
§88-74. Allowance on service retirement. (a) Upon retirement
from service, a member shall receive a maximum retirement
allowance as follows:
 
(1)	 If the member has attained age fifty-five, a
retirement allowance of two per cent of the
member's average final compensation multiplied
by the total number of years of the member's
credited service as a class A and B member,
. . . provided that:
 
(A)	 After June 30, 1968, if the member has at
least ten years of credited service of
which the last five or more years prior to
retirement is credited service as a
 firefighter, police officer, or an
investigator of the department of the
prosecuting attorney;
 
.  .  .
 
then for each year of service as a firefighter,
police officer, . . . the retirement allowance
shall be two and one-half per cent of the
member's average final compensation. The maximum
retirement allowance for those members shall not
 exceed eighty per cent of the member's average
final compensation. (Emphasis added.)
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Perry also had accumulated 560.75 days (2.333 years) of
 
6
unused sick leave. Under HRS § 8-63 (1993),  service credit
received from unused sick leave was not subject to the 80%
 
benefit cap. Adding the service credits for his unused sick
 
leave to his credits for actual service increased Perry's maximum
 
retirement allowance to 85.8333% of his average final
 
compensation (80% + (2.333 years x 2.5%) = 85.8333%).
 
In 2009, in an effort to avoid the administrative 
process of collecting contributions from an employee, only to 
subsequently pay them back to the employee because the employee 
was not entitled to accrue additional benefits, Act 121 was 
introduced in the Hawai
'i Legislature. Act 121, which took 
effect July 1, 2009, amended several sections of HRS Chapter 88, including section 88-98. 
2009 Haw. Sess. Laws 316-22. Act 121 
clarified that a retirant re-entering service, who had reached the 80% cap, "shall not make any contributions under section 88­
45" and "shall not earn service credit or earn any additional 
retirement allowance." HRS § 88-98(c)(2) (Supp. 2010). 
6
 HRS § 88-63 provides as follows:
 
§88-63 Credit for unused sick leave. A public employee who
retires or leaves government service in good standing with sixty
days or more of unused sick leave shall be entitled to additional
service credit in the retirement system as follows:
 (1) An employee with sixty days of unused sick leave to the
employee's credit shall have the employee's years of service
increased by three months for the purpose of computing the
employee's retirement allowance.
 (2) For each additional twenty days or major fraction
thereof of unused sick leave in excess of sixty days that the
employee has to the employee's credit the employee shall have the
employee's years of service increased by one month for the purpose
of computing the employee's retirement allowance.
 The allowance on service retirement of section 88-74 and the
 
service benefit limitation therein shall not apply to retirement
allowances which exceed such limitations by virtue of the
application of this section in the computation of retirement
allowances and no reduction in such retirement allowances shall be
 made on account of such limitations. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A.	 The circuit court did not err in concluding that
Perry was not entitled to additional retirement
benefits when he had reached his maximum benefit
 cap in his first service.
 
Perry contends that, under the version of HRS § 88-98
 
in effect on October 1, 2007 when he took the position as police
 
chief, he was entitled to accrue additional retirement benefits
 
even though he had reached the 80% benefit cap under HRS § 88-74. 
He argues that Act 121, which added a new subsection (c) to 
HRS § 88-98, represented a change to the statute, not just a
 
"clarification," as argued by ERS and concluded by the circuit
 
court. Perry contends that HRS § 88-98(a), in effect throughout
 
the period of time in question, expressly provided that "any"
 
retirant returning to service was entitled to earn additional
 
retirement benefits, even if the retirant had reached the maximum
 
cap of 80% upon the first retirement.
 
ERS argues that, pursuant to the plain and unambiguous
 
language of HRS § 88-74(a)(1), viewed in pari materia with 
HRS § 88-98(a)(2), Perry was always subject to the 80% cap on his
 
police officer retirement benefits. ERS also asserts that 
HRS § 88-98(a)(1)(A) expressly provides that the calculations for
 
a retirant's re-employment period are subject to the "benefit
 
formula under section 88-74," including the 80% cap on the
 
maximum retirement benefits.
 
(1) 	The Relevant Statutes
 
(a) 	Active membership in ERS
 
All employees entering or re-entering service are
 
required to enroll as active members of ERS, pursuant to 
HRS §§ 88-42 (1993) and 88-98(a).
 
HRS § 88-42 provides, in relevant part, that 
§88-42 Membership generally. Except as otherwise
provided in this part, all employees of the Territory or any
county on July 1, 1945, shall be members of the system on
such date, and all persons who thereafter enter or reenter
the service of the State or any county shall become members
at the time of their entry or reentry.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS § 88-98(a) requires that, for any retirant whose
 
employment required active membership, the retirant was to be
 
"reenrolled as an active member of the system in the same class
 
from which the retirant originally retired[.]" 
(b) Contributions by member to ERS
 
Perry was a class B member when he retired in 2002 and
 
was re-enrolled as a class B member when he returned to work in
 
7
2007. Pursuant to HRS § 88-45 (Supp. 2010),  ERS was required to
collect contributions from Perry to the ERS annuity savings fund. 
The requirement that ERS collect contributions from re-enrolled
 
members was nullified, in part, by the enactment of Act 121. The
 
relevant portion of Act 121, as codified in HRS § 88-98(c)(2),8
 
exempted members who had already reached their maximum benefit
 level from having to make retirement contributions.
 
(c) Maximum retirement allowance cap upon retiring a
second time
 
HRS § 88-98(a) provides that if a previously retired
 
member returns to service and retires again, his retirement
 
allowance is equal to the allowance he was entitled to after his
 
first retirement, plus an additional amount based on the
 
retirement allowance option he had selected when he initially
 
retired, his age, years of service, average final compensation, 
7
 HRS § 88-45 provides:
 
§88-45. Employee contributions.  After June 30, 1988, each
class A and class B member shall contribute seven and eight-tenths
per cent of the member's compensation to the annuity savings
fund[.]
8
 HRS § 88-98(c) provides, in relevant part:
 
(c) If a retirant's maximum retirement allowance upon the
retirant's initial retirement was subject to the limits on maximum
retirement allowance under section 88-74:
 
. . . 
(2)	 If the retirant's maximum retirement allowance upon
the retirant's initial retirement was equal to or
greater than the applicable limit under section 88-74,
the retirant shall not earn service credit or earn any
additional retirement allowance during the retirant's
period of reemployment, and the reemployed retirant
shall not make any contributions under section 88-45. 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and other factors "in accordance with the benefit formula under
 
section 88-74 in existence at the time of the member's latest
 
retirement." Section 88-74(a) sets the maximum retirement
 
allowance at 80% of the member's average final compensation.
 
(d)	 Effect of unused sick leave on calculation of
 
total years of service
 
The final statute to guide the calculation of an ERS
 
member's retirement benefits is HRS § 88-63. This statute allows
 
an ERS member who leaves government service in good standing with
 
sixty days or more of sick leave to increase the member's years
 
of service at the rate of one month of service credit for every

(2) Statutory Interpretation of HRS Chapter 88
 
“The standard of review for statutory construction is 
well-established. The interpretation of a statute is a question 
of law which [the appellate] court reviews de novo. Where the 
language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, our only duty 
is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.” Liberty 
Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Dennison, 108 Hawai' i 380, 384, 120 P.3d 
1115, 1119 (2005) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). Where there is ambiguity, the courts may examine the 
context "with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences 
may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in determining 
legislative intent. One avenue is the use of legislative history 
as an interpretive tool." Morgan v. Planning Dep't, County of 
Kaua'i, 104 Hawai' i 173, 180, 86 P.3d 982, 989 (2004) (quoting 
State v. Sullivan, 97 Hawai' i 259, 262, 36 P.3d 803, 806 (2001) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). We accord judicial deference to ERS's interpretation of the statute unless 
"the interpretation is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with 
both the letter and intent of the statutory mandate." TIG Ins. 
Co. v. Kauhane, 101 Hawai' i 311, 321, 67 P.3d 810, 820 (App. 
2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).

(a) 80% cap on police officer retirement benefits
under HRS § 88-74(a)(1)
 
In 1967, the Legislature enacted Act 130, which
 
increased the retirement benefits for police officers from 2% to
 
2.5%. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 855, in 1967 Senate Journal, at
 
1221. At the same time, in an apparent trade-off for the .5%
 
increase in retirement benefits, Act 130 capped a police
 
officer's maximum retirement allowance at 80% of his average
 
final compensation.9 1967 Haw. Sess. Laws. Act 130, § 2 at 121. 
The 80% benefit cap language plainly and unambiguously provides
 that a police officer's maximum retirement allowance "shall not
 
exceed" 80% of the police officer's average final compensation. 
The legislative history of Act 130 also indicates ERS
 
was required to return to the member any amount in excess of the
 
80% cap. "Although the bill provides for an 80 per cent
 
limitation of the average final compensation, it also requires
 
the refund of that portion of the member's contributions which is
 
determined to be in excess of this limitation." See S. Stand.
 
Comm. Rep. No. 761, in 1967 House Journal, at 771.
 
(3) Relationship between HRS §§ 88-98(a)(1),(2) and
88-74(a)(1)
 
Because Perry returned to service after June 30, 1998,
 
HRS § 88-98(a)(2) applied, which provided that Perry's second
 
retirement allowance would be computed in accordance with 
HRS § 88-98(a)(1)(A). Upon his second retirement, Perry would
 
receive the retirement allowance he was entitled to after his
 
first retirement, plus 
the allowance to which the member is entitled for that
 
service based on the retirement allowance option initially
selected and computed for the member's age, average final
compensation, and other factors in accordance with the
benefit formula under section 88-74 in existence at the time
 of the member's latest retirement[.]
 
9
 Act 130 was codified as part of Revised Laws of Hawai' i (RLH) § 6-42
(1955). By 2002, when Perry retired, the 80% cap was found in HRS § 88-74(1)(Supp. 2002). In 2007, when Perry re-entered service, the 80% cap was inHRS § 88-74(a)(1)(Supp. 2007). 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 88-98(a)(1)(A). This statute directs one back to 
HRS § 88-74 for the formula to calculate retirements benefits and
 
includes the 80% cap. 
Act 121 clarified the relationship between HRS §§ 88-98
 
and 88-74 by amending HRS § 88-98 to provide, in relevant part,
 
that
 
(2) If the retirant's maximum retirement allowance upon the
retirant's initial retirement was equal to or greater than
the applicable limit under section 88-74, the retirant shall
not earn service credit or earn any additional retirement
allowance during the retirant's period of reemployment and
the reemployed retirant shall not make any contributions
under section 88-45[.]
 
2009 Haw. Sess. Laws, Act 121, § 3 at 318-19, enacted as 
HRS § 88-98(c)(2). The legislative history of Act 121 indicates
 
its purpose was
 
to clarify certain provisions relating to [ERS] by, among
other things, specifying that: 
. . . 
(4) The cap on the maximum retirement allowance imposed on
certain members also apply to the retirant's benefits when
they are reemployed;
 
(5) ERS shall not collect retirement contributions from
reemployed retirants who reach the maximum average final
compensation ceiling[.]
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1706.
 
Furthermore, "[t]he clarifications contained in this
 
measure will conform existing ERS statutes to current practice
 
and help to streamline the administration of the ERS, allowing
 
the ERS to provide more accurate and efficient service to their
 
members." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1239.
 
The Legislature amended HRS § 88-98 several times but
 
at no time did they exempt benefits earned for actual service
 
during re-employment from the 80% cap set under HRS § 88-74, as
 
they had done for unused sick leave. See HRS § 88-63. Because
 
we can presume the Legislature knows existing law and the
 
relationship between HRS §§ 88-98 and 88-74, the lack of action
 
in exempting benefits from the 80% cap suggests there was no
 
intention to do so. Agustin v. Dan Ostrow Const. Co., Inc., 64
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Haw. 80, 83, 636 P.2d 1348, 1351 (1981) ("[T]he legislature is
 
presumed to know the law when enacting statutes[.]")
 
Finally, if benefits could be added to a police 
officer's retirement allowance after his second retirement 
without regard to the 80% cap, police officers could easily evade 
the cap by retiring and then later returning to service. To 
interpret and apply HRS § 88-98 in this manner renders the 
statute meaningless and leads to an absurd result. Morgan, 104 
Hawai'i at 185, 86 P.3d at 994 ("The legislature is presumed not 
to intend an absurd result[.]") (internal quotation marks, 
citation, and brackets omitted). 
In light of the legislative history behind HRS § 88-98,
 
and viewed in pari materia with HRS § 88-74, we conclude that at
 
all times relevant to this case, Perry was not entitled to earn
 
an additional retirement allowance upon re-entry into service
 
beyond the 80% cap reached in his first service. The provisions
 
of HRS Chapter 88 in effect in 2007 barred Perry from receiving
 
service credit beyond the statutory cap. HRS § 88-98 required
 
"any" retirant to re-enroll as an active ERS member and required
 
ERS to suspend the retirant's retirement allowance. The
 
retirant's compensation upon his second retirement is to be
 
calculated according to the benefit formula under HRS § 88-74,
 
which capped a police officer's maximum retirement allowance at
 
80%. The effect of HRS § 88-98(c) was to (1) clarify that the
 
80% benefit limit under HRS § 88-74 applied to a retirant who
 
returns to service and (2) release ERS from the requirement to
 
collect contributions from those not qualified to receive
 
additional benefits. 
Our conclusion that the circuit court did not err in
 
affirming the ERS's decision against Perry is supported by the
 
general judicial deference accorded to ERS's interpretation of
 
the statute. See Haole, 111 Hawaii at 150, 140 P.3d at 383.

B.	 Perry incorrectly applies Kim v. Employees'
Retirement System, 89 Hawai' i 70, 968 P.2d 1081
(App. 1998) to the instant case. 
Perry asserts that Kim v. Employees' Retirement System, 
89 Hawai' i 70, 968 P.2d 1081 (App. 1998) stands for the 
proposition that under HRS § 88-98, Perry's first and second 
retirement benefits should be calculated "separately and 
independently" based on separate credited years. We disagree. 
Kim did not concern a retirant who had reached the 80% cap on his 
maximum retirement allowance; rather, the issue was whether, upon 
Kim's second retirement, ERS could reduce Kim's monthly benefit 
by the monthly benefits ERS had paid out during Kim's first 
retirement. The question before this court was what it meant 
under HRS § 88-98 (1993) to calculate Kim's benefits "as if the 
retirant were retiring for the first time[.]" Kim, 89 Hawai' i at 
71, 968 P.2d at 1082. 
Without any discussion of the 80% benefit cap, the
 
court determined that Kim's total years of credited service were
 properly computed by combining his two periods of service. Id.
 
at 76-77, 968 P.2d at 1087-88. The court also concluded that
 Kim's monthly benefit could not be reduced by the total of the
 
monthly payments made during his first retirement. Id. If
 
anything, Kim supports ERS's position in the instant case because
 this court affirmed that HRS § 88-98 required ERS to compute a
 
retirant's credited service years by combining both periods of
 
service. Id. at 73, 968 P.2d at 1084.
 
C.	 Perry incorrectly argues that his HPD retirement
allowance was suspended in exchange for the right
to earn an additional retirement allowance.
 
Perry argues that if he was not entitled to earn a
 
second retirement benefit allowance, "he would not have been
 
required to enroll in ERS and have his HPD benefits suspended."
 
He contends his retirement allowance was suspended in exchange
 
for the right to earn additional benefits. This is an incorrect
 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contention because ERS was statutorily required to enroll Perry
 
in ERS and suspend his retirement benefits, pursuant to 
HRS §§ 88-42 and 88-98 (a). Therefore, Perry's argument that his
 
HPD retirement benefits were suspended in exchange for the right
 
to earn an additional retirement allowance is without merit.
 
D.	 The circuit court did not err in concluding that
Perry's issue about having made contributions to
ERS through payroll deductions is moot.
 
From October 1, 2007 until the September 1, 2009
 
payroll period, Perry contributed to ERS through payroll
 
deductions as mandated by HRS § 88-45. Before the passage of Act
 
121, ERS had no choice but to take annuity fund payroll
 
deductions from every member, including members who were not
 
eligible to accrue any additional retirement benefits because
 
they had reached the 80% cap under HRS § 88-74. Under ERS's
 
interpretation of federal tax law, ERS was required to refund
 
those excess funds to members ineligible to receive additional
 
benefits. In its September 23, 2009 letter, ERS informed Perry
 
that it would refund Perry's retirement contributions made since
 
October 1, 2007 because Perry was not eligible to accrue any
 
additional retirement benefits.
 
Perry argues that the issue of the deductions was not
 
moot because "[p]romising after the fact that the money will be
 
returned is obviously no excuse or defense for taking someone's
 
pay without authorization in the first place." Perry also argues
 
that the fact that ERS took contributions was indicative of
 
Perry's entitlement to additional retirement benefits.
 
Perry's arguments are without merit. As has just 
been discussed, until passage of Act 121, ERS was required to
 
take a percentage of every member's paycheck. With the passage
 
of Act 121, ERS no longer had to take funds from those members
 
who were ineligible to accrue additional retirement benefits. 
Perry was promised a refund of ERS contributions made since 
October 1, 2007, along with interest on those funds.
 
18
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The circuit court did not err in determining the issue
 
regarding payroll deductions was moot when Perry's funds had been
 
returned to him with interest. "A case is moot where the
 
question to be determined is abstract and does not rest on
 
existing facts or rights." State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 
474-475, 946 P.2d 32, 44-45 (1997) (citing AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., 
Inc. v. Bateman, 82 Hawai' i 453, 458–59, 923 P.2d 395, 400–01 
(1996) (quoting In re Application of J.T. Thomas, 73 Haw. 223,
 225–26, 832 P.2d 253, 254 (1992)).
 
E.	 The circuit court erred in concluding that Perry
waived his state constitutional claim under article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution,
10 but did not err in concluding that
Perry waived his Contract Clause claim underarticle I, section 10 of the United StatesConstitution.
11 
In its Decision and Order, the circuit court found the
 
following:
 
16. There was no error in the Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Final Decision and Order of the ERS
 
Board, dated March 23, 2010, which found no violation of
Article XVI, Section 2 of the Hawaii Constitution.
 
17. For the first time on appeal, Appellant appears
to raise a claim that the ERS violated the State or Federal
 Contracts Clause. Appellant has not shown the Court that
this constitutional argument was properly preserved for this
appeal. The Court considers the argument waived and does
not consider it on this appeal.
 
To preserve his constitutional claims before the
 
circuit court, Perry must have raised the claims in his appeal
 
before ERS. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai' i 
438, 500, 164 P.3d 696, 758 (2007) (citing to HRS § 641–2 (Supp.
 
10
 Article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution provides: 
Section 2.  Membership in any employees' retirement system
of the State or any political subdivision thereof shall be a
contractual relationship, the accrued benefits of which shall not
be diminished or impaired.
11
 Article 1, section 10 of the United States Constitution states, in
relevant part, that "[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the
Obligation of Contracts[.]"
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2006) ("The appellate court ... need not consider a point that
 
was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate
 
manner.")).
 
Perry effectively preserved his state constitutional 
claim in his January 26, 2010 letter to ERS, in which he cites to 
article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution and argues 
that ERS's application of HRS § 88-98(c)(2) "diminished and impaired my ERS benefits protected by the Hawaii State 
Constitution." Furthermore, the circuit court addressed the 
issue on appeal. Therefore, Perry's argument as it relates to 
the Hawai' i Constitution was preserved and will be addressed in 
the next section. 
On the other hand, Perry concedes he failed to raise 
his Contract Clause claim in the administrative proceedings. Nonetheless, he argues that under HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle 
Industry Licensing Board, 69 Haw. 135, 736 P.2d 1271 (1987), a 
failure to raise a constitutional argument below does not waive 
his right to raise it on appeal. HOH, 69 Haw. at 142, 736 P.2d 
at 1275. In HOH, the issue was the constitutionality of a statute. Although HOH failed to raise the constitutionality 
issue in the administrative hearing, the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
held that HOH could raise it on appeal because an administrative agency "generally lacks power to pass upon the constitutionality 
of a statute." Id. at 141, 736 P.2d at 1275. 
HOH does not apply to the instant case because Perry is
 
not challenging on Contract Clause grounds the constitutionality
 
of a provision that the ERS lacked the power to pass upon. On
 
appeal, Perry is merely raising a claim that ERS violated the
 
Contract Clause, a claim he failed to raise below. Because Perry
 
failed to raise the alleged Contract Clause claim before ERS, the
 
circuit court correctly found that Perry had waived that argument
 
on appeal. Waikiki Resort Hotel, Inc. v. City & Cnty. of
 
Honolulu, 63 Haw. 222, 250, 624 P.2d 1353, 1372 (1981) ("[T]he
 general rule that an appellate court will consider only such
 
questions as were raised and reserved in the lower court applies
 
20
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on review by courts of administrative determinations so as to
 
preclude from consideration questions or issues which were not
 
raised in administrative proceedings.").
 
E.	 The circuit court did not err when it determined 
ERS did not violate article XVI, section 2 of theHawai'i Constitution. 
Perry contends his benefits were "diminished and 
impaired," in violation of article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution, when ERS suspended Perry's HPD retirement benefits 
but denied him the right to earn additional retirement benefits 
for his service as police chief. However, the legislature is not 
precluded from reducing a member's benefits with respect to 
future service provided the reduction is not applied to benefits 
already earned. See Comm. of the Whole Report No. 18, Journal of 
the Const. Con. of 1950, p.330; Chun v. Board of Trustees, 61 Haw. 596, 606, 607 P.2d 415, 421 (1980) (the legislature may 
reduce benefits as to a person's future services). 
As previously discussed, HRS §§ 88-74(a) and 88-98(a)
 
were both in effect at the time of Perry's re-enrollment on
 
October 1, 2007. Pursuant to these statutes, Perry was not
 
entitled to additional retirement benefits because he had already
 
reached the 80% maximum retirement allowance for police officers. 
Because these statutes were in effect throughout Perry's first
 
service, retirement, and reentry into service, the application of
 
the statutes' provisions, including the 80% cap on benefits, does
 
not diminish or impair Perry's accrued benefits and,
 
consequently, does not violate the article XVI, section 2. 
Because Perry had not accrued any benefits, he had no benefits
 
that were "diminished or impaired" by the enactment of Act 121.
