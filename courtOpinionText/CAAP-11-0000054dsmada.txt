APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-1487)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant Patsy Naomi
 
Sakuma (Appellant Sakuma) has asserted from the Honorable Bert I.
 Ayabe's August 31, 2010 "Judgment Based Upon Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale by Commissioner,
 Allowance of Costs, Expenses, Commissions and Fees, Directing
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Conveyance and Distribution of Proceeds, for Writ of Possession 
and Disposal of Personal Property, Filed May 8, 2009" (the August 31, 2010 judgment on the order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property), because Appellant Sakuma's appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP). 
The August 31, 2010 judgment on the order confirming
 
the sale of the foreclosed property is an appealable judgment
 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)(2) (Supp.
 
12010). Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),  Appellant Sakuma extended
the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal from the August 31, 2010 judgment on the order 
confirming the sale of the foreclosed property when Appellant Sakuma filed her September 10, 2010 motion for reconsideration within ten days after entry of the August 31, 2010 judgment on the order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property, as Rule 59 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRCP) 
required. 
However, when a party files a timely tolling motion
 
that extends the time period for filing a notice of appeal
 
1
 Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
provides: 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
(Emphases added).

pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), "[t]he rule provides that the 
court has 90 days to dispose of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . , regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai' i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 
(2007). When "the court fail[s] to issue an order on [the movant]'s [post-judgment tolling] motion by . . . ninety days after [the movant has] filed the [post-judgment tolling] motion, the [post-judgment tolling] motion [i]s deemed denied." County 
of Hawai' i v. C&J Coupe Family Limited Partnership, 119 Hawai' i 
352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008). On December 9, 2010, the ninety-day time period after the filing of Appellant Sakuma's September 10, 2010 HRCP Rule 59 motion for reconsideration expired, at which time Appellant Sakuma's September 10, 2010 HRCP Rule 59 motion for reconsideration was deemed denied under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). In light of the December 9, 2010 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) deemed denial of Appellant Sakuma's September 10, 2010 HRCP Rule 59 motion for reconsideration, the circuit court's subsequent February 11, 2010 order purporting to deny Appellant Sakuma's September 10, 2010 HRCP Rule 59 motion for reconsideration is a superfluous nullity. Appellant Sakuma did not file her January 27, 2011 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the December 9, 2010 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) deemed denial of Appellant Sakuma's September 10, 2010 HRCP Rule 59 motion for reconsideration, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) required for a timely appeal from the August 31, 2010 judgment on the order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property. Therefore, Appellant Sakuma's appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently,
 we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000054 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
