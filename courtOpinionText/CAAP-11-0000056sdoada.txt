NO. CAAP-11-0000056
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NOLAN L.K. CRABBE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-08-058783)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nolan L.K. Crabbe (Crabbe) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment entered on January 25, 2011 (Judgment), by the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiawa Division (District
 
1
Court).  Following a bench trial, Crabbe was convicted of
 
Excessive Speeding in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
ยง 291C-105 (2007 & Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, relying on 
State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 
216 P.3d 1227 (2009), Crabbe contends that: (1) there was 
insufficient foundation established for the speed reading of the 
laser gun; (2) there was insufficient evidence that Honolulu 
Police Department Lieutenant Ryan Nishibun (Lt. Nishibun) was 
qualified to operate the laser gun; and (3) without such 
evidence, there is insufficient evidence of the offense.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Crabbe's contentions as follows:
 
(1) Lt. Nishibun testified, inter alia, that he 
performed four tests on the LTI 20/20 Ultralight laser gun, in accordance with the manufacturer's established procedures and 
instructions, which were contained in the manual provided by the 
manufacturer, within the testing time frames recommended by the 
manufacturer, and that the tests indicated that the laser gun was 
working properly. We conclude that the foundation laid by Lt. 
Nishibun's testimony was sufficient to support the laser gun's 
speed reading. See Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. 
(2) Lt. Nishibun testified, inter alia, that he was
 
trained and qualified on the operation of the LTI 20/20
 Ultralight laser gun, that he passed all parts of his basic
 
training on the laser gun and, later, the instructor training,
 
and that during that training he was provided with a training
 
manual for the LTI 20/20, which was provided by the manufacturer,
 
and that his training was based upon the manufacturer's training
 
manual. In addition, Lt. Nishibun has had 22 years of practical
 
experience and has used the LTI 20/20 approximately ten thousand
 
times. Lt. Nishibun's testimony was sufficient to meet the
 
State's burden of proof regarding his qualification by training
 
and experience to operate the laser gun. See id. We conclude
 
that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by
 concluding that Lt. Nishibun's testimony provided a proper
 
foundation for the speed reading given by the laser gun.
 
(3) Having rejected Crabbe's contention that the
 
evidence supporting his conviction was inadmissible, we reject
 
his argument that without the challenged evidence there is
 
insufficient evidence to support his conviction.
