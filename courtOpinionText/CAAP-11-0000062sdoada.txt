MILES Y. KAJIYAMA,
Claimant-Appellant,
v.
 
KALANI HONUA and
 
HAWAII EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, INC.,
Employer/Insurance Carrier-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEAL BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-187(H) (1-07-003580))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Miles Kajiyama, (Kajiyama) appeals
 
from the January 11, 2011 Decision and Order (D&O) by the Labor
 
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). The D&O adopted
 
LIRAB's September 28, 2010 Proposed Decision and Order (Proposed
 
D&O) affirming in part, and denying in part the March 6, 2009
 
Supplemental Decision of the Director of the Labor and Industrial
 
Relations. The D&O resolved a workers' compensation dispute
 
brought by Kajiyama against Employer-Appellee, Kalani Honua
 
(Honua) and Insurance Carrier Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance
 
Company, Inc. (collectively, Employer).
 
On appeal, Kajiyama argues that LIRAB erred by adopting
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Findings of Fact (FOF) 17, 28, 30, 36 and 37 of
 
the Proposed D&O;
 
(2) Conclusions of Law (COL) 1 and denying the
 
treatment plans dated January 23, 2008, August 7, 2008, and
 
September 25, 2008;
 
(3) COL 2 and denying the treatment plan dated March
 
4, 2008; and
 
(4) COL 3 and denying the treatment plan dated August
 
7, 2008. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Kajiyama's appeal is without merit.
 
LIRAB affirmed Employer's denial of the treatment plans
 
of January 23, 2008 with Gurpal (Paul) Sandhu, M.D.; of August 7,
 
2008 with Henry H. Yang, M.D.; and of September 25, 2008 with
 
Jeffrey J.K. Lee, M.D. (Dr. Lee) (collectively, Concurrent
 
Treatment Plans) because these treatment plans were not approved
 
by Dale McSherry, D.C. (Dr. McSherry). LIRAB found that as
 
Kajiyama's attending physician, Dr. McSherry was required to
 
obtain Employer's consent for any concurrent treatments by other
 
physicians.
 
Kajiyama does not dispute that Hawaii Administrative
 
1 2
Rules (HAR) § 12-15-40 and HAR § 12-15-51  apply to the
1
 HAR § 12-15-40 provides in relevant part:
 
HAR § 12-15-40. Concurrent medical treatment
(a) One attending physician shall be in charge of the
care of the injured employee. However, treatment by more
than one qualified health care provider may be allowed if
the attending physician determines the employee's injury
involves more than one body system and requires
multidiscipline care or is so severe or complex that
services of more than one qualified health care provider are
required.
 
(b) When requesting consideration for concurrent
treatment, the attending physician shall obtain permission
 
2
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Concurrent Treatment Plans. Instead, Kajiyama argues that "the
 
medical providers substantially complied with HAR § 12-15-40[.]" 
Kajiyama argues that LIRAB should have construed the requirements
 
of HAR liberally to comply with Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 386-24, which states the policy of medical rehabilitation
 
laws under workers compensation is to allow for "the greatest
 
possible medical rehabilitation."
 
Kajiyama is asking the court to ignore the express
 
provisions of HAR §§ 12-15-40 and 12-15-51. Because 
HAR §§ 12-15-40 and 12-15-51 clearly require prior approval by
 
the attending physician before concurrent treatment or elective
 
surgery may be approved, LIRAB did not err in denying the
 
Concurrent Treatment Plans.
 
LIRAB affirmed Employer's denial of the March 4, 2008
 
treatment plan, stating that "[b]ased on substantial medical
 
evidence and [Lorne K. Direnfeld, M.D.'s (Dr. Direnfeld)]
 
December 24, 2009 opinion, passive treatment modalities are no
 
longer reasonably necessary or appropriate for treatment of
 
[Kajiyama's work injury.]" LIRAB further found that "Employer's
 
denial of Dr. McSherry's August 7, 2008 treatment plan . . . was
 
proper, because Dr. Lee evaluated [Kajiyama's] left knee on
 
from the employer prior to initiating such referral. The
name, business address, discipline, and specialty of the
assisting qualified health care provider and the reasons for
concurrent treatment shall be submitted in writing to the
employer at least seven calendar days prior to referral.
 
2
 HAR § 12-15-51 provides in relevant part:
 
HAR § 12-15-51. Surgery
(a) [w]hen elective surgery is contemplated, the
attending physician shall obtain permission from the
employer at least seven calendar days prior to the date of
the proposed surgery. Written notification shall include
 procedure code, medical documentation justifying the need
for surgery, the estimated date of surgery, and the hospital
where the surgery is to be performed. The notification
 shall permit the employer to determine whether the injured
employee should be examined by a physician of the employer’s
choice as provided under section 386-79, HRS.

April 17, 2008 and provided his opinion regarding possible
 
surgical treatment[.]"
 
Kajiyama argues that Employer did not present
 
substantial evidence that the knee surgery was unreasonable or
 
unnecessary to support the denial of the March 4, 2008 treatment
 
plan, and similarly that Employer did not present evidence that
 
continued treatment of Kajiyama's low back was unnecessary in
 
support of its denial of the Dr. McSherry's August 7, 2008
 
treatment plan. Kajiyama argues that LIRAB improperly weighed
 
Dr. Direnfeld's testimony regarding both the necessity of surgery
 
and the effectiveness of passive treatment modalities. In
 
essence, Kajiyama argues that LIRAB erred in weighing the
 
evidence presented. 
However, this court gives "deference to LIRAB's 
assessment of the credibility of witnesses and the weight LIRAB 
gives to the evidence." Moi v. State, Dept. of Public Safety, 
118 Hawai' i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 756 (App. 2008). 
Furthermore, 
it is well established that courts decline to consider the
 
weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in
favor of the administrative findings, or to review the
agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of
witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings
of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field.
 
Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai' i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002) 
(quoting Igawa v. Koa House Restaurant, 97 Hawai' i 402, 409-410, 
38 P.3d 570, 577-578 (2001)). 
In the instant case, LIRAB was presented with
 
substantial evidence in support of its determination to approve
 
the denials of the March 4, 2008 treatment plan and
 
Dr. McSherry's August 7, 2008 treatment plan. LIRAB examined the
 
testimony of Dr. Direnfeld, as well as the opinion of Dr. Lee,
 
and determined that Employer's denial of the two treatment plans
 
was proper. LIRAB properly exercised its discretion in weighing
 
the evidence presented to it. Therefore, LIRAB did not err in

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
finding that Employer properly denied the March 4, 2008 treatment
 
plan and Dr. McSherry's August 7, 2008 treatment plan.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 11, 2011 Decision
 
and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 Board is affirmed.
