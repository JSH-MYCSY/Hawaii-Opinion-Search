(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Phillip DeJesus DeLeon (DeLeon)
 
appeals from the December 15, 2010 Amended Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence (Amended Judgment) of the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court), convicting DeLeon of Murder in the
Second Degree, as to Shawn Powell (Powell), in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 707-701.5 (1993 Repl.) and 706­
656 (Supp. 2012) (Count II); Reckless Endangering in the First

 A December 7, 2010 judgment incorrectly stated that DeLeon had been
convicted as charged of Attempted Murder in the Second Degree as to Count III,
rather than the lesser included offense of Reckless Endangering in the First
Degree. On December 15, 2010, the circuit court filed the Amended Judgment
that corrected the mistake. DeLeon's Notice of Appeal was filed after the
Amended Judgment. Although the Notice of Appeal referenced the December 7,

of a Separate Felony, in violation of HRS §§ 134-21 (2011 Repl.),
 
707-701.5, and 706-656, as to Count II (Count IV); Carrying or
 
Use of Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony, in
 
violation of HRS §§ 134-21, 705-500 (1993 Repl.), 707-701.5, and
 
706-656, as to Count III (Count V); Reckless Endangering in the
 
First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-713, as to Jermaine
 
Beaudoin and/or Lane Akiona (Count VII); and Ownership or
 
Possession Prohibited of Any Firearm or Ammunition by a Person
 
Indicted for Certain Crimes, in violation of HRS § 134-7(b) and
 
(h) (2011 Repl.) (Count VIII).
 
DeLeon raises the following points of error on appeal: 
(1) DeLeon's defense counsel provided ineffective
 
assistance of counsel by failing to establish Powell's recent
 cocaine ingestion;
 
(2) the circuit court's self-defense instruction, based 
on Hawai' i Standard Jury Instructions Criminal (HAWJIC) 
Instruction 7.01, which omitted the language of HRS § 703-304(3) (1993 Repl. and Supp. 2012), failed to completely and properly 
instruct the jury on the law of self-defense; 
(3) the circuit court erroneously refused to instruct
 
the jury on extreme mental or emotional disturbance (EMED)
 
Manslaughter, as a mitigating circumstance in Count II; and
 
(4) the circuit court wrongfully convicted and
 
sentenced DeLeon as to Count V because the jury convicted him in
 
Count III of the included offense of Reckless Endangering in the
 
First Degree under HRS § 707-713, an offense which is excluded
 
under HRS § 134-21(a)(2).

2010 judgment, "a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should 
not result 
in loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment 
can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misled by the 
mistake." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 228, 235, 74 P.3d 980, 987 (2003)
(citation omitted); see also Rule 3(c)(2) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure. Here, both parties addressed the appeal based on the Amended
Judgment and the State was not misled by the mistake in the Notice of Appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised therein, we resolve
 
DeLeon's appeal as follows:
 
(1) DeLeon argues that his trial counsel provided 
ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to establish that 
Powell ingested cocaine prior to the shooting. When reviewing an 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we look at "whether 
defense counsel's assistance was within the range of competence 
demanded of attorneys in criminal cases." State v. Wakisaka, 102 
Hawai'i 504, 513-14, 78 P.3d 317, 326-27 (2003) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The defendant has the burden of establishing ineffective
assistance of counsel and must meet the following two-part
test: 1) that there were specific errors or omissions
reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence;
and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially
meritorious defense.
 
Id. at 514, 78 P.3d at 327 (quotation and citation omitted).
 
First, DeLeon points to counsel's "failure to move the 
court to rule on the admission of the cocaine evidence at least 
in advance of Dr. [William] Goodhue's testimony, as this error or 
omission resulted in the loss of a critical opportunity to 
apprise the jury of that evidence." DeLeon asserts, along these 
lines, that the defense lost the opportunity to cross-examine any 
of the prosecution witnesses about cocaine in Powell's body. 
Second, DeLeon points to counsel's "failure to direct Dr. 
[Clifford] Wong to present his retrograde cocaine extrapolations 
and explain his opinion that Powell was impacted by the 
substances during the [Hawai' i Rules of Evidence, Rule] 104 
hearing, even after prompting by the court." DeLeon contends this error resulted in the lost opportunity for Dr. Wong to 
introduce this evidence and his opinion before the jury. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DeLeon fails the first prong of Wakisaka in that he
 
fails to demonstrate how the two alleged errors are in fact
 
"errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill,
 
judgment, or diligence[.]" Id. To the extent DeLeon argues that
 
trial counsel should have sought to have the cocaine evidence
 admitted during the State's case, that was a decision of trial
 
strategy and "[d]efense counsel's tactical decisions at trial
 
generally will not be questioned by a reviewing court." State v.
 
Silva, 75 Haw. 419, 441, 864 P.2d 583, 593 (1993) (citation
 omitted).
 
To the extent that DeLeon suggests that Dr. Goodhue's 
testimony could have provided the foundation for Dr. Wong's 
testimony, DeLeon fails to provide any indication that Dr. 
Goodhue had such information, or would have testified as to such 
information. Cf. State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 
1227, 1247 (1998) ("Ineffective assistance of counsel claims based on the failure to obtain witnesses must be supported by 
affidavits or sworn statements describing the testimony of the 
proffered witnesses.") (citations omitted). In this regard, 
Dr. Wong testified that he would need further information to 
provide a more definite opinion as to whether Powell was impaired 
by cocaine at the time of the shooting. There is no evidence 
that Dr. Goodhue could provide the information that Dr. Wong 
needed. 
To the extent DeLeon contends that trial counsel failed
 
during the HRE Rule 104 hearing to direct Dr. Wong to present his
 
retrograde cocaine extrapolations and explain his opinion that
 
Powell was impacted by cocaine and alcohol, the transcript for
 
the hearing reveals that there were no specific errors or
 
omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment or
 
diligence. Trial counsel elicited extensive testimony from
 
Dr. Wong regarding his opinions related to the impact of alcohol
 
and cocaine on Powell. Moreover, trial counsel had submitted as
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
an exhibit Dr. Wong's letter dated August 9, 2010, which
 
contained Dr. Wong's retrograde extrapolation of Powell's blood
 
cocaine concentration at the time of the shooting. The
 
transcript from the HRE Rule 104 hearing, as well as the
 
transcript from a September 3, 2010 hearing on motions in limine,
 
establish that the circuit court had clearly reviewed the letter
 
and referenced it during the hearings.
 
In addition to the above, DeLeon has failed to 
establish the second prong of Wakisaka, that the errors or 
omissions he alleges were made by trial counsel resulted in the 
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious 
defense. 102 Hawai' i at 514, 78 P.3d at 327. DeLeon has not 
produced any evidence that having the HRE Rule 104 hearing prior to Dr. Goodhue's testimony could have resulted in a ruling 
allowing admission of the cocaine evidence. Moreover, DeLeon 
raises no direct challenge to the circuit court's ruling that the 
cocaine evidence was inadmissible and that Dr. Wong's opinion 
regarding whether Powell was under the influence of cocaine at 
the time of the shooting was unreliable and thus inadmissible. 
Deleon's claims of ineffective assistance of trial
 
counsel thus lack merit.
 
(2) DeLeon contends that the circuit court's jury
 
instructions on self-defense, which mirrored HAWJIC 7.01 (2008),
 
in effect at the time, failed to correctly and completely state
 
the law of self-defense because the instructions contained none
 
of the language in HRS § 703-304(3) advising the jury that "a
 
person employing protective force may estimate the necessity
 
thereof under the circumstances as he believes them to be when
 
the force is used without retreating, . . . doing any other act
 
which he has no legal duty to do, or abstaining from any lawful
 
action;" and therefore the circuit court "incompletely instructed
 
the jury on how to consider self-defense by precluding it from
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
understanding that DeLeon was entitled to estimate the necessity
 
of his use of force."
 
DeLeon's point of error in this regard is specific to
 
his conviction in Count II, Murder in the Second Degree, for the
 
shooting of Powell. As to Count II, DeLeon's use of deadly force
 
is in question.
 
As is the case here, where an appellant did not object 
to jury instructions below, the appellant must first demonstrate 
instructional error by rebutting the "presumption that 
unobjected-to jury instructions are correct[.]" State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 337 n.6, 141 P.3d 974, 984 n.6 (2006). 
Because DeLeon cannot demonstrate instructional error, we need 
not address the State's argument that any such error was 
harmless. 
To the extent that DeLeon's argument is that the 
instructions should have included the language in HRS § 703­
304(3) that "a person employing protective force may estimate the 
necessity thereof under the circumstances as he believes them to 
be when the force is used[,]" the instruction provided by the 
circuit court was not erroneous. In this regard, the self-
defense instructions in this case advised the jury to consider 
DeLeon's self-defense claim "from the viewpoint of a reasonable 
person in the defendant's position under the circumstances of 
which the defendant was aware or as the defendant reasonably 
believed them to be." This language is essentially identical to 
the instruction given in State v. Augustin, 101 Hawai' i 127, 63 
P.3d 1097 (2002), which also was based on HAWJIC 7.01. In Augustin, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the instruction in 
that case was "fully consonant with the controlling statutory and case law of this state." Id. at 127, 63 P.3d at 1097. Thus, 
DeLeon's arguments in this regard lack merit. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
To the extent DeLeon's argument is that the retreat
 
language in HRS § 703-304(3) should have been included in the
 
jury instructions, this argument also lacks merit. HRS § 703­
304(3) expressly provides an exception for the circumstances
 
addressed in subsection (5), which deals with the use of deadly
 
force. HRS § 703-304(3) states that:
 
[e]xcept as otherwise provided in subsections (4) and (5) of
this section, a person employing protective force may
estimate the necessity thereof under the circumstances as he
believes them to be when the force is used without
 retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act
which he has no legal duty to do, or abstaining from any
lawful action.
 
(Emphasis added). In turn, HRS § 703-304(5) states in relevant
 
part that:
 
[t]he use of deadly force is not justifiable under this
section if . . . [t]he actor knows that he can avoid the
necessity of using such force with complete safety by
retreating or by surrendering possession of a thing to a
person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying
with a demand that he abstain from any action which he has
no duty to take[.]
 
(Emphasis added). While HRS § 703-304(3) states generally that
 
protective force may be used without retreating, HRS § 703-304(5)
 
provides specifically that an actor has the duty to retreat
 
before using deadly force if the actor knows that he can avoid
 
using deadly force with complete safety by retreating. Thus, the
 
instructions were not erroneous because they properly instructed
 
the jury as to the requirements for retreating in regards to the
 
use of deadly force in Count II.
 
(3) DeLeon argues that the circuit court erroneously
 
refused to instruct the jury on EMED Manslaughter, as a
 
mitigating circumstance in Count II (Second Degree Murder).
 
DeLeon objected to the lack of an EMED instruction before the
 
trial court. When the omission of jury instructions is
 
challenged on appeal, the issue is whether, when read and
 
considered as a whole, the instructions given were prejudicially
 
insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. See State

v. Gonsalves, 108 Hawai' i 289, 292-93, 119 P.3d 597, 600-01 
(2005). 
HRS § 707-702(2) (Supp. 2012) provides: 
In a prosecution for murder or attempted murder in the first
and second degrees it is an affirmative defense, which
reduces the offense to manslaughter or attempted
manslaughter, that the defendant was, at the time the
defendant caused the death of the other person, under the
influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for
 which there is a reasonable explanation. The reasonableness
of the explanation shall be determined from the viewpoint of
a reasonable person in the circumstances as the defendant
believed them to be.
 
In State v. Sawyer, the Hawai' i Supreme Court explained 
that an EMED instruction is warranted if the record reflects any
 
evidence of a subjective nature that the defendant acted under a
 
loss of self control resulting from an extreme mental or
 
emotional disturbance, stating:
 
We have stated that "the defendant must satisfy a
subjective/objective test" in proffering a "reasonable
explanation" in accordance with HRS § 707-702(2). Kaiama, 
81 Hawai' i at 26, 911 P.2d at 746 (citing State v. 
Seguritan, 70 Haw. 173, 174, 766 P.2d 128, 129 (1988)); see also Russo, 69 Haw. at 78, 734 P.2d at 159. First, in
satisfying the subjective portion, the record must reflect
the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Second, in satisfying the objective portion, the record mustsupport "a reasonable explanation or excuse for the actor's
disturbance." Kaiama, 81 Hawai' i at 26, 911 P.2d at 746 
(quoting Russo, 69 Haw. at 77-78, 734 P.2d at 159). 
Much confusion has arisen over whether the court or the jury
determines the reasonableness of the defendant's explanation
 or excuse. We hold that the trial court determines whether
 
or not the record reflects any evidence of a subjective
nature that the defendant acted under a loss of self-control
 resulting from extreme mental or emotional disturbance. If
 
the record does not reflect any such evidence, then the
trial court shall properly refuse to instruct the jury on
EMED manslaughter. However, if the record reflects any
 
evidence of a subjective nature that the defendant acted
under the influence of extreme mental or emotional
 disturbance, then the issue must be submitted to the jury,
and the trial court should instruct the jury on EMED
manslaughter. The jury then decides whether or not the
prosecution has disproved the mitigating EMED manslaughter
defense beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
88 Hawai' i 325, 333, 966 P.2d 637, 645 (1998) (underline emphasis 
added).
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
DeLeon did not testify at trial. The only evidence in
 
the record that DeLeon points to in arguing that the subjective
 
prong of the test is satisfied is the testimony of Joe Chang
 
(Chang) regarding an incident at Club Seven. DeLeon argues that
 
Chang's testimony showed "that after Powell put his arm around
 
DeLeon, [DeLeon] was false-cracked in the midst of a nightclub of
 
strangers for no reason by another stranger who turned out to be
 
with Powell's group, and then warned by Chang in no uncertain
 
terms to 'get the hell out of [there].'" Notwithstanding Chang's
 
testimony, DeLeon fails to point to "any evidence of a subjective
 
nature that the defendant acted under a loss of self control
 
resulting from extreme mental or emotional disturbance." Sawyer,
 
at 333, 966 P.2d at 645.
 
Additionally, there is no evidence that DeLeon was 
under the influence of EMED during the shooting in the parking lot of Seoul Karaoke, or in other words "at the time the 
defendant caused the death of the other person[.]" HRS § 707­
702(2); See State v. Aganon, 97 Hawai' i 299, 304, 36 P.3d 1269, 
1274 (2001) (testimony by a witness that the defendant, on a different occasion, threatened the witness and got really angry 
was extraneous); State v. Moore, 82 Hawai' i 202, 210-11, 921 P.2d 
122, 130-31 (1996) (testimony that the defendant was agitated, nervous, frantic, and anxious at the time of his arrest did not 
support an EMED instruction); State v. Pavich, 119 Hawai' i 74, 
88-89, 193 P.3d 1274, 1288-89 (App. 2008). 
The circuit court thus did not err in refusing to give
 
an EMED instruction.
 
(4) DeLeon argues that the circuit court wrongly
 
convicted and sentenced him as to Count V. As to Count V, the
 jury found DeLeon guilty of Carrying or Use of Firearm in the
 
Commission of a Separate Felony (with respect to Count III). As
 
to Count III (originally attempted murder in the second degree),
 
the jury found DeLeon guilty of the offense of reckless
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
10endangering in the first degree under HRS § 707-713, an offense
which is excluded under HRS § 134-21(a)(2).  HRS § 134-21(a)(2)
provides in relevant part:
[§134-21] Carrying or use of firearm in the commission
of a separate felony; penalty.  (a) It shall be unlawful for
a person to knowingly carry on the person or have within the
person's immediate control or intentionally use or threaten
to use a firearm while engaged in the commission of a
separate felony, whether the firearm was loaded or not, and
whether operable or not; provided that a person shall not be
prosecuted under this subsection when the separate felony
is:
. . . 
(2)The felony offense of reckless endangering in the
first degree under section 707-713[.]"
(Emphasis added).
The State concedes that the circuit court erred in
convicting DeLeon of Count V and requests that this court reverse
the Count V conviction and vacate the Count V sentence.  We agree
with the State's concession.  Under the provisions of HRS § 134-
21(a)(2), the circuit court's conviction and sentence as to Count
V is not authorized and we therefore reverse the Count V
conviction and vacate the accompanying sentence.
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 15, 2010 Amended
Judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is reversed as
to the Count V conviction and the sentence related to Count V is
vacated.  The Amended Judgment is affirmed in all other respects.
