Arbitration Award Clarifying Award Of May 7, 2010, Filed October
 
11, 2010, which was filed on January 31, 2011. 
HSTA primarily contends that the Circuit Court erred
 
when it vacated, in part, an arbitrator's award that interpreted
 a Collective Bargaining Agreement provision to allow interest on
 back pay in order to make the grievant whole. We agree. Neither
 sovereign immunity nor the statutory prohibition against the
 award of pre-judgment interest against the State are implicated
 here. Public policy does not bar the arbitrator's award. An
 arbitrator's error in construing an agreement or misinterpreting
 applicable law is not sufficient ground for overturning an
 arbitration award, even assuming such errors were made. Before
 reaching these issues, however, this court must first address the
 complex procedural posture of this appeal.
 I. RELEVANT BACKGROUND FACTS
 A. The Arbitration Proceedings
 HSTA participated in an arbitration with the State of 
Hawai
'i, Department of Education (State or Employer) with respect 
to the State's termination of a union member and public school teacher, Kathleen Morita (Morita). Morita was a public school 
teacher at Hauula Elementary School, and a member of HSTA. Based 
on a custodian's report of the smell of "pot" in her classroom and the presence of what appeared to the custodian (based on its shape and cap cover) to be a wine bottle inside a paper bag, Morita was allegedly smoking marijuana, and in possession of alcohol in her classroom, on September 12, 2007. Over a period of several months, the incident was investigated, and the State 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
terminated Morita from her teaching position on July 18, 2008,
 
effective July 31, 2008.
 
Pursuant to the applicable Collective Bargaining
 
Agreement, and in accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 89-10.8 (2012), Morita's grievance was submitted to binding
 
arbitration before Arbitrator Walter Ikeda (Arbitrator), who
 
rendered a Decision and Award on May 7, 2010 (Award). In the
 Award, the Arbitrator sustained Morita's grievance, determining
 
that the State lacked just cause to terminate Morita. The
 Arbitrator ordered that Morita be reinstated, and that she should
 be restored her service time for benefits, and awarded her back
 pay "with interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum on
 any unpaid amounts that are due and owing." The Award did not
 specify an amount, as it was potentially subject to offsets for
 unemployment benefits, wages, and other payments received during
 the period of unemployment. The Award also stated that the
 Arbitrator would retain limited jurisdiction, for a period not to
 exceed six months from the date of the Award, to assure
 compliance with the Award.
 
On May 27, 2010, the State filed a motion to correct or
 
modify the Award, requesting that the Arbitrator delete the
 interest on the back pay. The State's motion was denied on June
 16, 2010.
 
On July 28, 2010, HSTA filed a motion requesting that
 
the Arbitrator enter a final decision and award. On or about
 September 25, 2010, the Arbitrator entered a Compliance Order;
 Post Decision and Award of May 7, 2010 (Compliance Order). In
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Compliance Order, the Arbitrator identified various filings
 
in the Circuit Court (which are discussed below). He explained
 that, while HSTA had requested a final award and order with a
 fixed amount because the parties had been unable to agree to what
 normally would have been a ministerial mathematical calculation,
 he elected to treat it as a compliance matter pursuant to his
 continuing jurisdiction pursuant to the Award, the Collective
 Bargaining Agreement, and HRS Chapter 658A. The Compliance Order
 specifically addressed several issues potentially affecting the
 amount of payment due to Morita, including the effect of
 unemployment insurance payments, wages from another job, health
 care deductibles, and the treatment of retirement benefits. 
The other issue addressed by the Arbitrator in the
 
Compliance Order was the issue of the Arbitrator's award of
 interest on any unpaid back pay, after the required offsets. The
 Arbitrator considered and rejected the State's argument, i.e.,
 that the Arbitrator lacked authority to impose interest because
 it had not been agreed to in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. 
He stated his reasoning as follows:
 
[T]he Arbitrator believes that he is acting in conformity
[with] the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the authority
granted by HRS, Chapter 658A in the determination that any
backpay award includes interest at the rate of 10 percent
per annum. The purpose of an award of backpay including
interest is to "make whole" financially the Grievant had she
not been terminated. Elkouri & Elkouri, How Arbitration
 Works,
 6th Ed. 2003, p. 1224. Payment to the Grievant of
wrongfully withheld pay without interest would not restore

her whole as loss of use of funds for that period entailed
either deprivation or additional costs to the Grievant if
she had to borrow funds to replace lost wages while awaiting
the results of her grievance.
 
Noting that the Employer indicated a possible appeal
 
from at least the interest portion of the Award, the Compliance
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Order set forth the principal amount of the back pay (which was
 
adjusted for setoffs) and detailed the methodology to be used for
 the calculation of the interest, from a date certain (August 1,
 2008) until the back pay was paid.
 
B. The Circuit Court Proceedings
 1. HSTA's Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award
 
On May 18, 2010, HSTA filed a Motion to Confirm
 
Arbitration Award, Entry of Judgment and Allowing Costs and Other
 Appropriate Relief (Motion to Confirm). The State filed a
 
memorandum in opposition, challenging the awarded interest and
 
opposing HSTA's request for attorneys' fees and costs. On
 October 1, 2010, the Circuit Court entered (1) an Order Granting
 in Part and Denying in Part Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award,
 Entry of Judgment and Allowing Costs and Other Appropriate Relief
 (Order Confirming Award); and (2) a Judgment in favor of HSTA and
 
against the State (10/1/10 Judgment). In the Order Confirming
 Award, the Circuit Court confirmed the Award, and ordered that
 
judgment be entered, but denied without prejudice HSTA's request
 for attorneys' fees and costs. The 10/1/10 Judgment included
 reference to HRS § 658A-25(a), and expressly stated that it
 resolved all claims by and against the parties, and that "[a]ny
 and all remaining claims, if any, are dismissed with prejudice."
 
2. The State's Challenges to the Award
 
Meanwhile, on what appears to be a parallel track in
 
the same case, the State filed two motions pertaining to the
 Arbitration Award: (1) a July 9, 2010 Employer's Motion to
 Modify or Correct [the Award] (State's Motion to Modify Award);
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and (2) a July 26, 2010 Employer's Motion to Vacate in Part [the
 
Award] (State's Motion to Vacate Award). Both motions sought
 
relief from the Arbitrator's award of interest, but the State's
 
2
Motion to Modify Award relied on HRS § 658A-24(a)(3),  whereas
the State's Motion to Vacate Award relied on HRS § 658A­23(a)(4).
3
 
Pursuant to an order entered on October 1, 2010, the
 
State's Motion to Modify Award was denied on the grounds the
 motion impermissibly sought to affect the merits of the Award
 (Order Denying Modification of Award). On October 1, 2010, the
 
Circuit Court also entered an order entitled "Order Denying
 
Employer's Oral Motion for Leave to File Motion to Vacate Award
 Dated May 7, 2010, Filed Orally on July 15, 2010" (Order Denying
 
Oral Motion).
 
The disposition of the State's Motion to Vacate Award
 
was more complicated. In the first instance, an unfiled copy of
 
2	 HRS § 658A-24(a)(3) (Supp. 2015) provides: 
§ 658A-24 Modification or correction of award.  (a)
Upon motion made within ninety days after the movant
receives notice of the award pursuant to section 658A-19 or
within ninety days after the movant receives notice of a
modified or corrected award pursuant to section 658A-20, the
court shall modify or correct the award if:
. . . . 
(3) 	The award is imperfect in a matter of form not
affecting the merits of the decision on the
claims submitted.
 
3
 HRS § 658A-23(a)(4) (Supp. 2012) provides:
 
§ 658A-23 Vacating award. (a) Upon motion to the
court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court
shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:
. . . .
 
(4) 	An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's
 
powers[.]
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the motion was delivered to HSTA's attorneys. The unfiled copy
 
did not include a hearing date and therefore did not provide
 notice of a hearing on the motion. A hearing was held on
 September 13, 2010. No opposition was filed and no one appeared
 for HSTA at the September 13, 2010 hearing. At that hearing, the
 State entered its appearance and the Circuit Court orally granted
 the State's Motion to Vacate Award. The written order on the
 State's Motion to Vacate Award was not entered until January 4,
 2011, and was entitled "Order Granting Employer's Motion to
 Vacate in Part Award Dated May 7, 2010" (Order Partially Vacating
 
Award).
 
Prior to the entry of the Circuit Court's Order
 
Partially Vacating Award, on October 7, 2010, HSTA filed a motion
 
denominated as a "Motion for Reconsideration" of the State's
 Motion to Vacate Award, but which we will refer to as a motion
 for rehearing (HSTA's Motion for Rehearing). HSTA's Motion for
 
Rehearing apprised the Circuit Court that HSTA had not been
 
served with notice of the September 13, 2010 hearing, and
 addressed the merits of the State's Motion to Vacate Award. 
While the State agreed that, under the circumstances, a further
 hearing should be set, it argued that the relief setting aside
 the Arbitrator's award of interest was properly granted. On
 November 22, 2010, a hearing was held on HSTA's Motion for
 Rehearing and the matter was taken under advisement by the
 Circuit Court. On November 23, 2010, a minute order was entered
 denying HSTA's Motion for Rehearing. A written order denying
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HSTA's Motion for Rehearing was entered on January 4, 2011 (Order
 
Denying HSTA's Motion for Rehearing).
 
3. HSTA's Motion to Amend the 10/1/10 Judgment
 
Meanwhile, shortly after the Circuit Court entered the
 
Order Confirming Award and the 10/1/10 Judgment, back on what
 
appears to be the first track, on October 11, 2010, HSTA filed a
 Motion to Alter and Amend Judgment Entered October 1, 2010
 (HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment). In this motion, HSTA
 
sought to amend the 10/1/10 Judgment to either include the 
specific amount of back pay reflected in the Arbitrator's
 Compliance Order or, in the alternative, to confirm Arbitrator's
 Compliance Order.
4 On November 8, 2010, a hearing was held on
 
HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment. At the hearing, the
 Circuit Court orally granted HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10
 Judgment. However, the written order reflecting this ruling,
 titled Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Alter and Amend Judgment
 Entered October 1, 2010 or in the Alternative to Confirm
 Supplemental Arbitration Award Clarifying Award Of May 7, 2010,
 Filed October 11, 2010 (Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Amend
 
10/1/10 Judgment), was not entered until January 31, 2011. 
4
 On the same day, October 11, 2010, HSTA filed a separate Motion to
Allow Reasonable Attorneys' Fees and Costs. HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10
Judgment also requested that any attorneys' fees and costs awarded to HSTA bereflected in an amended judgment. Both of these motions were set for hearingon November 8, 2010. On February 22, 2011, the Circuit Court entered an orderdenying attorney's fees and costs to HSTA (Order Denying HSTA's Fees). The Order Denying HSTA's Fees – or perhaps more accurately, the deemed denial ofHSTA's motion to allow fees, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3) – is not challenged on appeal. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
4. The (Second) Final Judgment
 
On February 24, 2011, the Circuit Court entered a
 
"Final Judgment" (2/24/11 Judgment), which entered judgment: (1)
 
in favor of HSTA and against the State "on the reinstatement and
 
back pay to grievant in conformity with the [Award]"; and (2) in
 favor of the State and against HSTA "on the 10% interest on the
 back pay in the [Award] and on HSTA's request for fees."
 
5. This Appeal
 
On February 1, 2011, HSTA filed a Notice of Appeal from
 
the January 4, 2011 orders, i.e., the Order Partially Vacating
 the Award and the Order Denying HSTA's Motion for Rehearing. 
This appeal was docketed as CAAP-11-0000065.
 
On March 8, 2011, HSTA filed a second Notice of Appeal
 
from the 2/24/11 Judgment. HSTA's second notice also purported
 to appeal from the Order Partially Vacating Award and the Order
 Denying HSTA's Motion for Rehearing, as well as the Order
 Granting HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment.
5 The second
 
appeal was docketed as CAAP-11-0000140.
 
Upon a motion by HSTA, on April 12, 2011, this court
 
consolidated the appeals.
 
On November 26, 2013, the Intermediate Court of Appeals
 
(ICA) filed an opinion in which, for the reasons stated therein,
 
the court: (1) vacated the Circuit Court's February 24, 2011
 
Final Judgment; (2) reversed the Circuit Court's January 4, 2011
 orders, the Order Granting Employer's Motion to Vacate in Part
 
5
 The second notice also states that it appeals from the Circuit
Court's February 24, 2011 Notice of Entry of Judgment.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Award Dated May 7, 2010, and the Order Denying HSTA's Motion for 
Reconsideration of Employer's Motion to Vacate in Part Award Dated May 7, 2010; and (3) dismissed HSTA's appeal of the Circuit Court's January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Alter and to Amend Judgment Entered October 1, 2010 or in the Alternative to Confirm Supplemental Arbitration Award Clarifying Award Of May 7, 2010, Filed October 11, 2010. On September 15, 2014, the ICA entered an order vacating opinion, in light of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's Opinion in Ass'n of Condo. Homeowners of 
Tropics at Waikele v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai 'i 254, 318 P.3d 94 (2013) 
(Sakuma). 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
HSTA raises five points of error, contending that the
 
Circuit Court:6 (1) exceeded its authority when it vacated in
 
part the Award; (2) erred in vacating in part the Award based on
 
sovereign immunity; (3) erred in failing to recognize the State's
 waiver of sovereign immunity; (4) erred in construing the Award
 as granting pre-judgment interest and therefore violating public
 policy; and (5) exceeded its authority and otherwise erred in the
 rulings stated in or omitted from the Order Granting HSTA's
 Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment and the 2/24/11 Judgment.
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that 
is reviewed de novo by the appellate court. See e.g., Captain 
Andy's Sailing, Inc., v. Dep't of Land & Nat. Res., 113 Hawai
'i 
184, 192, 150 P.3d 833, 841 (2006). 
6
 HSTA's points are paraphrased for brevity and clarity.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jurisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Without jurisdiction, a court is not in a position to
consider the case further. [A party's] failure to file a
timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional defect that can
neither be waived by the parties nor disregarded by the
court in the exercise of judicial discretion. . . . A
 judgment rendered by a court without subject matter
jurisdiction is void, questions about the trial court's
subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of
the case[.]
 
Wong v. Wong, 79 Hawai 'i 26, 29, 897 P.2d 953, 956 (1995) 
(citations omitted).
 
The lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter
cannot be waived by the parties. If the parties do not raise
the issue, a court sua sponte will, for unless jurisdiction
of the court over the subject matter exists, any judgment
rendered is invalid.
 
Chun v. Emps.' Ret. Sys. , 73 Haw. 9, 13, 828 P.2d 260, 263 (1992)
 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
"We review the circuit court's ruling on an arbitration
 
award de novo, but we also are mindful that the circuit court's
 
review of arbitral awards must be extremely narrow and
 exceedingly deferential." 
Kona Vill. Realty, Inc. v. Sunstone
  
Realty Partners, XIV, LLC, 121 Hawai 'i 110, 112, 214 P.3d 1100, 
1102 (App. 2009), aff'd, 123 Hawai 'i 476, 236 P.3d 456 (2010) 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
Judicial review of an arbitration award is limited
 
based upon the following precepts:
 
First, because of the legislative policy to encourage
arbitration and thereby discourage litigation, arbitrators
have broad discretion in resolving the dispute. Upon
submission of an issue, the arbitrator has authority to
determine the entire question, including the legal
construction of terms of a contract or lease, as well as the
disputed facts. In fact, where the parties agree to
arbitrate, they thereby assume all the hazards of the
arbitration process, including the risk that the arbitrators
may make mistakes in the application of law and in their
findings of fact.
 
Second, correlatively, judicial review of an
arbitration award is confined to the strictest possible
limits. An arbitration award may be vacated only on the four
 
11

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
grounds specified in HRS § 658–9 and modified and corrected
only on the three grounds specified in HRS § 658–10.
Moreover, the courts have no business weighing the merits of
the award.
 
Third, HRS §§ 658–9 and –10 also restrict the
authority of appellate courts to review judgments entered by
circuit courts confirming or vacating the arbitration
awards. 
Although formulated under the prior arbitration
statute, this standard of review is equally applicable to
arbitrations conducted under HRS Chapter 658A. Under HRS
Chapter 658A, an arbitration award can be vacated only on
the six grounds specified in HRS § 658A–23(a) and modified
and corrected only on the three grounds specified in HRS
§ 658A–24.

'i 127, 137–38, 149 P.3d 495, 505–06 (2006)). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 A. The Two Judgments
 HSTA formulates five substantive points of error in
 
this appeal. However, as set forth in the Applicable Standards
 of Review, and in light of what appears to be a pair of "final
 judgments," we must also consider both: (1) whether this court
 has appellate jurisdiction to review all of the issues raised in
 this appeal; and (2) whether the Circuit Court had the authority
 to proceed to enter orders and a second judgment on what we
 described above as a "parallel track," after the Circuit Court
 entered the 10/1/10 Judgment.
 
We begin with an examination of the 10/1/10 Judgment,
 
which states:
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Pursuant to the 1) [Order Confirming Award], 2) [Order
Denying Modification of Award], 3) [Order Denying Oral
Motion], Judgment is hereby entered in conformity with the
[Award] in accordance with Section 658A-25(a), Hawaii
Revised Statutes, in favor of [HSTA] and against [the
State].
This judgment is entered as to all claims
 raised by
the parties, and 
it resolves all claims by and against the
parties in the above-entitled case. No claims or parties
remain.
 
Any and all remaining claims, if any, are dismissed
with prejudice.

 
(Format altered; emphases added.)
 
HRS § 658A-25(a) (Supp. 2015), which was referenced in
 
the 10/1/10 Judgment, provides: 
§658A-25 Judgment on award; attorney's fees and
litigation expenses. (a) Upon granting an order confirming,
vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or
correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment in
conformity therewith. The judgment may be recorded,
docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a civil
action.
 
We also consider the 10/1/10 Judgment in light of the
 
statute authorizing appeals to the appellate courts in cases
 
involving arbitration awards:
 
§ 658A-28 Appeals.  (a) An appeal may be taken from:
. . . .
 
(3) 	An order confirming or denying confirmation of
an award;
(4)	 An order modifying or correcting an award;
(5) 	An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or
(6) 	A final judgment entered pursuant to this
chapter.
(b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as
from an order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
HRS § 658A-28 (Supp. 2015).
 
As required by HRS § 658A-28(a)(6), the 10/1/10
 
Judgment was "entered pursuant to this chapter" because it meets
 
the requirements of HRS § 658A-25(a), i.e., final judgment was
 entered pursuant to an order granting confirmation of an
 arbitration award. In addition, the 10/1/10 Judgment expressly
 states that it resolves all claims by and against the parties, no
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties or claims remain, and that any and all remaining claims
 
are dismissed with prejudice. Thus, the 10/1/10 Judgment
 constituted a final and appealable judgment.
 
No appeal was taken by either HSTA or the State within 
the 30-day period provided in HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).
7 However, HSTA 
timely filed a post-judgment motion, HSTA's Motion to Amend the 10/1/10 Judgment, within 10 days of the entry of the judgment. See Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59(e) ("Any 
motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment."). Thus, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the time for filing a notice of appeal was extended. At all times relevant to this appeal, HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provided: 
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST -JUDGMENT MOTIONS . If any
party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law,
to amend findings or make additional findings, for a new
trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or order,
or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing the
notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an
order disposing of the motion; provided, that the failure to
dispose of any motion by order entered upon the record
within 90 days after the date the motion was filed shall
constitute a denial of the motion.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The last clause of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) is highlighted
 
because, in this case, the Circuit Court failed to enter an order
 
within 90 days after the date that HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10
 Judgment was filed. HSTA's motion was filed on October 11, 2010. 
7
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) provides, in relevant part:
 
Rule 4. APPEALS - WHEN TAKEN.
 
(a) Appeals in civil cases.
(1) TIME AND PLACE OF FILING . When a civil appeal is
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be
filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment
or appealable order.
 
14
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, to the extent that it constituted a post-judgment 
motion to amend the 10/1/10 Judgment, HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment appeared to be deemed denied on January 10, 2011.
8 Accordingly, pursuant to a plain reading of HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3), the parties would have had 30 days from that date to timely file an appeal from the 10/1/10 Judgment. See Sakuma, 131 
Hawai
'i at 256-57, 318 P.3d at 96-97 (Nakayama, J., dissenting).9 
However, in Sakuma, the majority opinion held that when a timely post-judgment motion for reconsideration is deemed denied, it does not trigger a thirty-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal until thirty days after entry of an order disposing of the motion. Id. at 256, 318 P.3d at 96. Thus, the HSTA's Motion to 
Amend 10/1/10 Judgment was not "deemed denied" on January 10, 2011 (as we previously had held), and the January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment constitutes the effective disposition on this motion. Finally, the January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment specifically states that: "An amended judgment consistent with this order shall be filed at an appropriate time." This judgment appears to be the 2/24/11 Judgment, which expressly enters judgment on six orders, and enters judgment: 
In favor of [HSTA] and against [the State] on the
reinstatement and back pay to the grievant in conformity
with the arbitration award filed on May 18, 2010, and in
favor of the [State] and against HSTA on the 10% interest on

 The 90th calendar day after October 11, 2010 is Sunday, January 9,
2011. Because it falls on a Sunday, the 90-day time period for HRAP Rule
4(a)(3) is extended until Monday, January 10, 2011 pursuant to HRAP Rule
26(a).

the back pay in the arbitration award and on HSTA's request
for fees.
 
On March 8, 2011, the HSTA timely filed a Notice of
 
Appeal from the 2/24/11 Judgment and, thus, this court has
 
appellate jurisdiction over all of the issues raised in this
 appeal.
 
We will address the Circuit Court's authority to enter
 
further orders on the "parallel track," after the Circuit Court
 entered the 10/1/10 Judgment, in conjunction with our substantive
 review.
 
B.	 The Circuit Court's Ruling on the Merits of the
Arbitration Award
 
Hawaii's Uniform Arbitration Act, HRS Chapter 658A,
 
sets forth the mechanisms and scope of judicial action concerning
 arbitration proceedings. HRS § 658A–22 (Supp. 2015) provides the
 mechanism for confirmation of an award:
 
§ 658A-22 Confirmation of award.  After a party to an
arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the
party may make a motion to the court for an order confirming
the award at which time the court shall issue a confirmation
 order unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to
section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section
658A-23.
 
This statute provides that an arbitration award shall
 
be confirmed unless it is either modified or corrected or it is
 
vacated. See also HRS §§ 658A-23(d) & 658A-24(b) (Supp. 2015)
 
(both requiring confirmation, absent an order vacating,
 correcting, or modifying). HRS § 658A-22 specifically identifies
 the three statutory provisions that authorize an outcome other
 than confirmation of an arbitration award, i.e., HRS §§ 658A-20,
 658A-24, and 658A-23. Here, the State did not challenge the
 Award based on HRS § 658A-20. Rather, the State's Motion to
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Modify Award was based on HRS § 658A-24(a)(3), which allows a
 
modification or correction if "[t]he award is imperfect in a
 matter of form not affecting the merits of the decision on the
 claims submitted." The State did not appeal the Circuit Court's
 denial of that motion on the grounds that it impermissibly sought
 to affect the merits of the Award. 
Of significance to this appeal is the third option, set
 
forth in HRS § 658A-23, which allows a court to vacate an
 arbitration award on one of six enumerated grounds. Here, the
 State sought relief from the Award based on HRS § 658A-23(a)(4),
 which provides:
 
§ 658A-23 Vacating award. (a) Upon motion to the
court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court
shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:
. . . .

 
(4) 	An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's
 powers[.]
 
Through these options, HRS Chapter 658A contemplates a
 
proceeding in which one party might seek to reduce an arbitration
 
award to a final judgment pursuant to a confirmation motion, and
 another party might seek to challenge an award to avoid
 confirmation of an award, in whole or part, and the reduction of
 the award to an enforceable judgment of the court. However, HRS
 Chapter 658A does not contemplate a case like this one, where one
 party secures an order confirming an award, and the court enters
 final judgment on the confirmation order, while the other party
 later secures an order vacating in part the same award, without
 challenging the court's entry of final judgment on the
 confirmation order.
 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
We cannot speculate as to why the Circuit Court entered
 
the 10/1/10 Judgment notwithstanding the parallel requests for
 
relief. We also cannot speculate as to why the State failed to
 seek relief from the 10/1/10 Judgment. However, the Supreme
 Court has explained that
 
the circuit courts are now governed by the Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Those rules set forth the circumstances 
under and the times within which the circuit courts may take
actions to review and set aside their own judgments, see 
HRCP 50, 52(b), 59, and 60, and a rule, HRCP 6(b), thatspecifically limits the granting of extensions of time totake such actions. Once a valid judgment is entered, the
only means by which a circuit court may thereafter alter oramend it is by appropriate motion under HRCP 59(e).DuPonte, 53 Haw. at 126, 488 P.2d at 539.
 
Wong, 79 Hawai 'i at 29-30, 897 P.2d at 956-57 (footnote omitted; 
emphasis added). 
HRS § 658A-23 provides statutory authority for relief 
from an arbitration award, but not from a final judgment on an 
order confirming an arbitration award. In order to seek relief in the Circuit Court from a final judgment entered pursuant to HRS § 658A-25(a), such as the 10/1/10 Judgment, the State had to file a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment. It did not. Under these circumstances, we must conclude that the Circuit Court was no longer authorized to enter an irreconcilably inconsistent order based on the State's Motion to Vacate Award. See Wong, 79 Hawai
'i at 29-30, 897 P.2d at 956-57. On this basis 
alone, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred when it entered the Order Partially Vacating Award and the Order Denying HSTA's Motion for Rehearing. 
Even assuming, arguendo, that the Circuit Court could
 
have vacated in part the Award, after entering the 10/1/10
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment on the Order Confirming Award, we conclude that the
 
Circuit Court erred in doing so in this case. As the State
 acknowledges, the State has expressly waived sovereign immunity
 with respect to Morita's grievance, which is a contract claim
 pursuant to the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, and
 the State has waived its immunity with respect to the submission
 of the claim to binding arbitration. See generally HRS § 89-10.8
 
HRS § 658A-1 (Supp. 2015); HRS § 661-1(1) (1993).
 
It is well-established that judicial review of 
arbitration awards is confined to "the strictest possible limits." Mars Constructors, Inc. v. Tropical Enters., Ltd., 51 
Haw. 332, 335, 460 P.2d 317, 319 (1969). Moreover, "the fact that an arbitrator may err in applying the law, finding facts, or in construing the contract, or enters an award that is contrary to the evidence adduced, is insufficient grounds for judicial reversal." In re Univ. of Haw. Prof'l Assembly, 66 Haw. 214, 
225, 659 P.2d 720, 728 (1983) (citation omitted). "An arbitrator's interpretation of a contract cannot be vacated by the reviewing court." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai
'i 226, 
241, 54 P.3d 397, 412 (2002). 
Here, the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the
 
HSTA and the State provides, in relevant part:
 
When the arbitrator finds that any disciplinary action was
improper, the action may be set aside, reduced or otherwise
modified by the arbitrator. 
The arbitrator may award back
pay to compensate the teacher wholly or partially for any
salary lost. Such back pay award shall be offset by all
other compensation received by the grievant(s) including but
not limited to unemployment compensation or wages.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
It is clear from the record of the arbitration
 
proceedings that the Arbitrator interpreted this contract
 
provision to allow an award to include interest on back pay in
 order to "wholly" compensate a teacher for lost salary. The
 Arbitrator explained that "[t]he purpose of an award of backpay
 including interest is to 'make whole' financially the Grievant
 had she not been terminated." He further reasoned that
 "[p]ayment to the Grievant of wrongfully withheld pay without
 interest would not restore her whole as loss of use of funds for
 that period entailed either deprivation or additional costs to
 the Grievant if she had to borrow funds to replace lost wages
 while awaiting the results of her grievance." 
We reject the State's argument that the Arbitrator 
exceeded his powers. The Arbitrator was expressly authorized to award "back pay to compensate the teacher wholly . . . for any salary lost." He interpreted this provision to allow interest for the time that Morita was without pay. Even if he incorrectly construed the agreement or misinterpreted applicable law, he acted within his power to interpret the agreement and fashion a remedy in accordance with his interpretation. See Daiichi 
Hawai
'i Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai 'i 325, 336, 82 
P.3d 411, 422 (2003) ("[W]here the parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby assume all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law and in their findings of fact.") (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted; format altered). 
20
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in vacating in part the
 
Award.
 
The State submits various arguments regarding sovereign 
immunity and public policy, based chiefly on HRS § 661-8 (1993), which prohibits pre-judgment interest on claims against the State.
10 We need not examine each nuance of the State's 
argument. As already stated, under HRS § 661-1, the State waived its sovereign immunity for contracts it entered into and, here, agreed to be bound by the Arbitrator's interpretation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, including whether the "compensate wholly" or "make whole" language expressly allowed the imposition of interest, even assuming that HRS § 661-8 is applicable to arbitration proceedings. Cf. Labrador v. Liberty 
Mut. Grp., 103 Hawai
'i 206, 211, 81 P.3d 386, 391 (2003), cited 
in Kenneth H. Hughes, Inc. v. Aloha Tower Dev., Corp., 654 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1149 (D. Haw. 2009) (holding that an "arbitration demand was not a claim and the award was not a judgment by the court, and therefore HRS § 661-8 is not controlling"). Neither sovereign immunity nor the public policy exception
11 to the 
deference given to arbitration awards are implicated here. Rather, the Arbitrator simply interpreted the "make whole" 
10 HRS § 661-8 provides:
 
§ 661-8 Interest. No interest shall be allowed on
 
any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment
thereon by the court, unless upon a contract expressly
stipulating for the payment of interest, or upon a refund of
a payment into the "litigated claims fund" as provided by
law.
 
11
 In Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific, Haw. Region v. Sause 
Bros., Inc., 77 Hawai' i 187, 193, 881 P.2d 1255, 1261 (App. 1994), this court
recognized that a court will not enforce a contract, or an arbitration award,that violates an explicit public policy. 
21
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
language in the Collective Bargaining Agreement to allow the
 
imposition of interest to compensate Morita wholly for her lost
 salary. Accordingly, we reject the State's argument that the
 Circuit Court did not err in vacating in part the Award.
 
C. HSTA's Requests for Corrections
 HSTA argues that the Circuit Court erred when it 
included, in the January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment, a detailed recitation from the Arbitrator's Compliance Order concerning the issue of reimbursement to the Hawai
'i Employment Retirement System that 
would occur upon Morita's return to active employment. The State notes, inter alia, that HSTA submitted the proposed form of order to the Circuit Court with this language in it and, more importantly, that it is mere surplusage as it does not specifically order offset or reimbursement. We find no reversible error in the inclusion of this language. 
HSTA also argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
failed to include, in the 2/24/11 Judgment, the dollar amount of
 the back pay award due to Morita, which was $25,169.05. It
 appears that the State has no objection to the inclusion of the
 specific dollar amount or disagreement with the amount stated,
 but submits that it is unnecessary to remand the case for that
 purpose. As the 2/24/11 Judgment must be vacated in part with
 respect to the entry of judgment in favor of the State and
 against HSTA on the 10% interest of the back pay in the
 arbitration award, on remand, the Circuit Court is instructed to 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
include the specific amount of the back pay award due to Morita,
 
in its (further) amended judgment.
 V.	 CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we: 
(1) vacate in part the 
Circuit Court's February 24, 2011 Final Judgment; (2) reverse the Circuit Court's January 4, 2011 orders, the Order Granting Employer's Motion to Vacate in Part Award Dated May 7, 2010, and the Order Denying HSTA's Motion for Reconsideration of Employer's Motion to Vacate in Part Award Dated May 7, 2010; and (3) affirm the Circuit Court's January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA's Motion to Alter and to Amend Judgment Entered October 1, 2010 or in the Alternative to Confirm Supplemental Arbitration Award Clarifying Award Of May 7, 2010, Filed October 11, 2010. This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.
