APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 10-1-133K, 10-1-134K, 10-1-135K)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
I. Introduction
 
This consolidated appeal involves efforts by Hawai 'i 
1
Conference Foundation  (HCF) to obtain regulatory approvals to
renovate three buildings (Buildings A, B, and C) located on a 
26,014 square-foot property that HCF owns in Keauhou, Hawai 'i 
(Property). Because the Property is located within the County of 
2
Hawaii's Special Management Area (SMA),  the renovations proposed
by HCF were subject to SMA regulations. HCF thus applied to the County of Hawai
'i Planning Department (Planning Department) 
requesting SMA exemptions for the proposed action to Buildings A and C, and requesting a SMA Minor Use Permit for Building B. After the Director of the Planning Department, Bobby Jean Leithead-Todd (Planning Director), issued determinations approving HCF's requests with various conditions, the owners of adjacent properties, John F. Dagres (Dagres) and Judith Fitzgerald (Fitzgerald) (collectively, the Neighbors), appealed the Planning Director's decisions to the County of Hawai
'i Board 
of Appeals (Board). 
Before the Board, the Neighbors argued inter alia that
 
HCF's proposed action should be subject to further SMA review. 
The Board affirmed the Planning Director. The Neighbors then
 appealed the Board's decisions to the Circuit Court of the Third
 
1
 We do not specifically identify each party's status as Appellee or
Appellant in the text of this opinion because each party (except the County of
Hawai'i Board of Appeals) is the Appellant in at least one of the appeals in
this consolidated matter.

 "'Special management area' means the land extending inland from the
shoreline as delineated on the maps filed with the authority as of June 8,
1977, or as amended pursuant to section 205A-23." Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 205A-22 (2001 and 2013 Supp.). "Authority" is defined in HRS § 205A­22.

Circuit (circuit court) in three separate civil cases (Civ. No.
 
10-01-133K, Civ. No. 10-01-134K, and Civ. No. 10-01-135K) which
 were consolidated (collectively, the Circuit Court Cases).
3 The
 
circuit court reversed in part the Planning Director and the
 Board, dismissed the remaining issues on appeal, and denied the
 Neighbors' motion for attorneys' fees and costs. HCF, the
 
4
Planning Department/Planning Director,  and the Neighbors have
each appealed from various decisions and orders of the circuit
 court.
 
II. Asserted Points of Error
 
A. CAAP-11-0000071
 
In CAAP-11-0000071, Planning Director appeals from the
 
Final Judgment (Judgment) in the Circuit Court Cases, filed on
 May 2, 2011, which reversed the "decisions of the Planning
 Director and the Board exempting Buildings 'A' and 'C' from the
 special management area process as set forth in the Planning
 Director's decisions in her October 20, 2009 letter to HCF[.]" 
The Judgment purported to resolve all appeals and claims against
 all parties. The Planning Director also challenges the circuit
 court's findings of fact, conclusions of law and order filed on
 January 5, 2011 (Circuit Court FOF/COL).
5
 
On appeal, Planning Director asserts the circuit court
 
erred by (1) concluding that HCF's proposed uses, activities or
 operations are "development" within the meaning of HRS § 205A-22
 
6
(2001 & 2010 Supp.)  and Rule 9-4(10)(A) of the County of Hawai 'i 
3 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided. 
4 Although both the Planning Department and the Planning Director are
parties to the appeal, we will refer to them collectively as "Planning
Director."
5
 The circuit court's findings, conclusions and order of January 5,
2011 are set forth in a document entitled "Appellants John F. Dagres and
Judith Fitzgerald's Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order."
6
 In 2009, HRS § 205A-22 provided in pertinent part:
 
§205A-22 Definitions.  As used in this part, unless
the context otherwise requires:
. . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

Planning Commission Rules (1992) (HPC Rules),  and that no
exemption is applicable; (2) concluding that the proposed uses,
 
activities, and operation may have a cumulative impact, or a
 significant environmental or ecological effect, on the SMA and
 are thus "development" as defined by HRS § 205A-22 and the HPC
 Rules; and (3) concluding that the Planning Director and the
 Board erred in not requiring an environmental assessment (EA) or
 environmental impact statement (EIS) pursuant to HRS Chapter
 343.
8
 
B. CAAP-11-0000074 and CAAP-11-0000434
 
HCF is the Appellant in both CAAP-11-0000074 and CAAP­
11-0000434. In these cases, HCF asserts the same points of error
 
6(...continued)
"Development" means any of the uses, activities, or
operations on land or in or under water within a special
management area that are included below:
. . . .
 
(5)	 Construction, reconstruction, demolition, or
alteration of the size of any structure.
 
"Development" does not include the following:
. . . . 
(6) 
. . . . Repair, maintenance, or interior alterations toexisting structures; [and]
(14) 
. . . . Structural and nonstructural improvements toexisting single-family residences, whereotherwise permissible; [ ]
provided that whenever the authority finds that any excluded
use, activity, or operation may have a cumulative impact, or
a significant environmental or ecological effect on a
special management area, that use, activity, or operation
shall be defined as "development" for the purpose of this
part.
 
In 2011, HRS § 205A-22 was amended so that exemption (14) is now
exemption (15). See 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 153, § 3 at 388. 
7
 The Planning Director's decisions subject to this appeal were made in
2009 pursuant to the version of the HPC Rules compiled in 1992. In 2010,
after the Planning Director issued the pertinent decisions, the numbering of
the HPC Rules was amended. Throughout this opinion, we cite to the version
applicable at the time of the Planning Director's decisions.
8
 The Planning Director challenges conclusions of law (COL) Nos. 30,
34-42, 47, 48, 50, 51, and 60-63. The Planning Director asserts it does not
challenge specific findings of facts (FOF) because it takes issue with how the
circuit court applied the law to the facts, not the facts themselves.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(in CAAP-11-0000434, HCF incorporates by reference its opening
 
and reply briefs from CAAP-11-0000074). 
HCF appeals from the Judgment, and in so doing
 
9
challenges (1) parts of the Circuit Court FOF/COL;  (2) an "Order
Denying Appellee Hawaii Conference Foundation's Motion to Dismiss
 Or, In The Alternative, Motion For Summary Judgment [Filed
 August 25, 2010] and Order Denying Appellee County of Hawaii
 Board of Appeals and Appellee Bobby Jean Leithead-Todd, Director
 of the Planning Department's Joinder in the Motion" (Order
 Denying HCF's Motion to Dismiss) filed October 25, 2010; and
 (3) the circuit court's oral denial of HCF's motion to add
 evidence to the record in the Circuit Court Cases on October 26,
 2010.
 
HCF contends the circuit court erred by: 
(1)(a) refusing to consider evidence of mootness outside the
 
pleadings upon HCF's motion to dismiss, (b) denying HCF's motion
 to dismiss for mootness, (c) denying HCF's motion to add evidence
 to the record and its request for judicial notice relative to its
 assertion of mootness, and (d) adjudicating Civ. No. 10-1-133K,
 regarding the exemptions for Buildings A and C, without subject
 matter jurisdiction; 
(2) holding that Buildings A and C were not "existing"
 
structures; 
(3) holding that the proposed changes to Building A and C
 
are not exempted from the definition of "development" pursuant to
 HRS § 205A-22(6); 
(4)(a)
 holding that the proposed activity may have

 
"cumulative impact, or a significant environmental or ecological
 effect" on the SMA and is thus "development", (b) ignoring the
 Board's finding of no adverse cumulative impact, (c) engaging in
 independent fact-finding on cumulative impact, and (d) holding
 that the Planning Director failed to consider cumulative impact
 of the proposed developments as a whole; 
9
 HCF assigns error to FOF Nos. 11, 19, 20-21, 30, 43-46, 49, and 55,
and COLs Nos. 15, 34-37, 40-42, 47-50, 60-62, and 64-68.
 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(5) holding that the SMA exemptions violated HRS § 343­
5(a)(3) (2010);10
 
(6) perpetrating a judicial taking; and 
(7) violating the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
 
Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq., by treating HCF less
 favorably than a secular landowner.
C. CAAP-11-0000433
 
In CAAP-11-0000433, the Neighbors appeal from the
 
Judgment and challenge the circuit court's "Order Granting in
 Part and Denying in Part Appellants' Motion for Reconsideration
 of Jurisdiction for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs" (Order re
 Attorneys' Fees and Costs) filed May 2, 2011. The Neighbors
 contend the circuit court erred by concluding that the facts of
 this case did not support an award of attorneys' fees and costs
 under the Private Attorney General Doctrine (PAGD).
 
For the following reasons, we conclude that the circuit
 
court was correct in reversing the rulings by the Planning
 Director and the Board that exempted the proposed action to
 Buildings A and C from the definition of "development" and thus
 from further SMA review. Moreover, the circuit court did not err
 in denying attorneys' fees and costs to the Neighbors.
III. Background
 
On October 9, 2009, HCF submitted a SMA Use Permit 
Assessment Application (October 2009 Assessment Application) to 
the Planning Department regarding the Property. HCF, a Hawai
'i 
non-profit corporation and the investment and property management arm of the Hawai
'i Conference of the United Church of Christ, is 
the fee owner of the Property. The Property is zoned Single-Family Residential (RS-10) and contains an area approximately 26,014 square-feet. The Property is located within the County of 
10 HRS § 343-5(a)(3) provides:
 
§343-5. Applicability and requirements. (a) Except as
otherwise provided, an environmental assessment shall be
required for actions that:
. . . .
 
(3)	 Propose any use within a shoreline area as
defined in section 205A-41[.]
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii's SMA, the area along the shoreline protected to ensure 
preservation and restoration of the coastal zone of the State of Hawai
'i. See HRS §§ 205A-21 to -23 (2001 & 2010 Supp.). 
Per the October 2009 Assessment Application, the
 
Property holds three structures: Buildings A, B, and C.
 
Building A is a 912 square-foot structure that
 
originally was legally constructed in 1960 with a footprint of a
 864 square-foot dwelling, but has since been converted without a
 building permit into a 5-bedroom, 4-bathroom, and no kitchen
 structure. Building B is a 672 square-foot structure for which
 no building permit was ever issued. Building C was initially
 built in 1960 pursuant to a building permit based on a floor plan
 matching Building A, thus consisting of a 864 square-foot
 dwelling. Subsequently, at some unknown time, Building C was
 expanded to a 1,884 square-foot structure, without applicable
 building permits,
 
consist[ing] of a large room designated as an "existing
conference room" . . . with a small kitchen and "powder
room" in the original 864 square foot structure. Added to
 this structure is a three-bedroom, three-bath building with
existing storage and laundry that has no internal connection
to the conference room structure, nor any internal
connection between the bedrooms. Between the two buildings
is a walk-in freezer and storage room not connected with
internal connections to either the existing conference room
or the all bed and bath building.
 
In the October 2009 Assessment Application submitted to
 
the Planning Director, HCF proposed both interior and exterior
 
renovations to the three buildings located on the Property in
 order to facilitate single-family use and "implement Conference
 ministries." HCF sought the following:
 
1.	 Interim safety improvements: SMA exemption to
allow for the boarding of windows and entry of
Buildings A and B and completion of roofing on
Building C.
 
2.	 Building A: SMA exemption to allow for the
interior and exterior renovations (including a
new kitchen) to the first existing single-family
residential dwelling to implement the residence
quarters for the ministry interns. No more than
 five unrelated individuals will reside in the
 single-family residential dwelling during any
period.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3.	 Building B: SMA Minor Use Permit to allow for
the interior and exterior renovations to the

 
existing building to be utilized as a meeting
facility for classroom activities and church
related functions, with no overnight
accommodations. The valuation of the
 renovations will not exceed $125,000.
 
4.	 Building C: SMA exemption to allow for the
interior and exterior renovations to the second

 
existing single-family residential dwelling to
implement the in-house parsonage residence and
accessory related uses. 
11
Pursuant to HRS Chapter 205A,  the County of Hawai 'i 
Planning Commission adopted the "Special Management Area Rules

 
and Regulations of the County of Hawaii" (Rule 9 of the HPC
 
Rules). HPC Rule 9-1 and 9-3. Pursuant to HPC Rule 9-8, a
 permit is required for any "development" within the SMA.
12 The
 
Planning Department evaluates proposed uses, activities or
 operations within the SMA to determine if a permit is required. 
HPC Rule 9-10. In 2009, Rule 9-10 instructed in pertinent part:
 
E. 	Where the Director finds the proposed use, activity or
operation is not in excess of $125,000 in valuation;
and will not have a significant adverse effect on the
[SMA], [the Director] shall, after the review and
recommendation of the Chief Engineer, issue a [SMA]
Minor Permit.
 
. . . .
 
F. 	The Director shall declare that a [SMA] Use Permit is
required if [the Director] finds that the proposed
use, activity or operation has a valuation in excess
of $125,000 or may have a significant adverse effect
on the [SMA]. 
11 HRS § 205A-27 (2001) provides, "[t]he authority is designated the
special management area authority and is authorized to carry out the
objectives, policies and procedures of this part."
12 In 2009, HPC Rule 9-8 provided:
 
9-8	 Permits Required for Development
 
A.	 No development shall be allowed within the Special
Management Area without obtaining a permit in
accordance with these Rules and Regulations.
 
B.	 No State or County Agency authorized to issue permits
within the [SMA] shall authorize any development
unless approval is first received in accordance with
these Rules and Regulations.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
G. 	The Director shall declare the proposed use, activity
or operation exempt from these Rules and Regulations
if [the Director] finds the proposal is exempt under
Rule 9.4(10)B.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Rule 9-4(10) provided in pertinent part:13
 
(10)	 "Development" means any of the following uses,
activities, or operations on land or in or under water
within the [SMA]:
 
A. "Development" includes the following:
 . . . .
 (v)	 Construction, reconstruction, or
alteration of the size of any
structure.
 
B. 	"Development" does not include the
following uses, activities or operations:
 
. . . .
 (vi) 	Repair, maintenance, or interior
alterations to existing structures
or relating to existing uses; [and]
 
. . . .
 (xv) 	Structural and non-structural
 improvements to existing
single-family residences, including
additional dwelling units, where
otherwise permissible[.]
. . . .
 
C. 	Any proposed use, activity or operation
listed in paragraph B shall be deemed to
be "Development" until the Director has
determined it to be exempted from the
definition of "development."
 
D. 	Whenever the Director finds that any use,
activity, or operation as excluded in
paragraph B is or may become part of a
larger project, the cumulative impact of
which may have a significant adverse
environmental or ecological effect on the
[SMA], that use, activity, or operation
shall be defined as "development" for the
purpose of these Rules and Regulations.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
13 The relevant exemptions under the HPC rules are set forth at HPC
Rule 9-4(10)(B)(vi) and (xv), which we will refer to respectively as Exemption
6 and Exemption 15. See also HRS § 205A-22.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In a letter dated October 20, 2009, the Planning
 
Director ruled that pursuant to HPC Rule 9-4, the proposed action
 
to Buildings A and C were exempt from the definition of
 "[d]evelopment" because "[r]epair, maintenance or interior
 alterations to existing structures or relating to existing uses"
 is an express exemption and the initial construction of Buildings
 A and C was legal. The Planning Director further determined that
 the proposed activity would not disrupt public access to the
 shoreline or public use of the shoreline area, and would not have
 a substantial adverse environmental effect on the SMA.
 
The Planning Director determined Building B was
 
development within the meaning of Rule 9-4(10) because it was
 "[c]onstruction, reconstruction, demolition, or alteration of the
 size of any structure[,]" and no exemption applied.
 
On November 4, 2009, HCF filed an Application for Plan
 
Approval regarding Building B to serve as a "[m]eeting facility
 to serve as a community resource and cultural enrichment
 building." In a letter dated November 9, 2009, the Planning
 Director granted HCF a SMA Minor Permit to allow for the "as­built" meeting facility, subject to compliance with conditions of
 approval and all applicable zoning and building code
 requirements. On November 10, 2009, the Planning Director issued
 a SMA Minor Permit (No. 09-000132) for Building B. The Planning
 Director determined the "development," Building B, will not have
 any significant adverse environmental or ecological effect on the
 SMA. In a letter dated November 12, 2009, the Planning Director
 granted Final Plan Approval for the "[a]s-built [m]eeting
 [f]acility, Building B".
 
Dagres and Fitzgerald separately own certain properties
 
which abut or are adjacent to the Property. The Neighbors filed
 three appeals to the Board from the decisions of the Planning
 Director: BOA 09-000089 filed on November 19, 2009 (appeal of
 Planning Director's decision dated October 20, 2009, which
 exempted Buildings A and C); BOA 09-000091 filed December 9, 2009
 (appeal of Planning Director's decision dated November 9, 2009,
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
granting the SMA Minor Permit for Building B); and BOA 09-000092
 
filed December 11, 2009 (appeal of Planning Director's decision
 dated November 12, 2009, approving Final Plan Approval for
 Building B). The Board consolidated the cases into one hearing.
 
The Board issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
Law, and Decision and Order, (Board's FOF/COL) signed June 25,
 2010, in which it held that the Neighbors failed to meet their
 burdens of proof, thus, the Board denied the appeals and affirmed
 the Planning Director's decisions. Any action of the Board
 requires four votes to validate, not a simple majority. Relevant
 to our purposes, the Board voted in regards to the exemptions for
 Buildings A and C three (3) ayes and two (2) noes that the
 Neighbors met their burden of proof to show the Planning Director
 clearly erred or was arbitrary and capricious in exempting
 Buildings A and C from SMA review. The Board's FOF/COL stated in
 relevant part (citations have been omitted):
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
18. The Director does not refer to the definition of 
"existing building" as defined in Chapter 5 (hereinafter"Building Code") of the Hawai' i County Code when determining
exemptions from "development" under HRS § 205A-22.
 . . . .
 21. Building "B" was not considered an "existing building"
by the Director because there was nothing in the Real
Property Tax records indicating its physical existence on
the ground.
 . . . .
 30. The Project proposed by HCF will not have a substantial
adverse ecological or environmental effect on the SMA,
taking into account potential cumulative effects.
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
9. "Development" does not include "[r]epair, maintenance, or
interior alterations to existing structures . . . ."
 
10. The Director has no authority to enforce Chapter 5
("Building Code") of the Hawai' i County Code. 
11. The County's Zoning Code provides that "[t]here may be
more than one single-family dwelling on each building site
in an RS district provided there is not less than the
required minimum building site area for each dwelling."
 
12. The minimum building area for a property located in the
RS-10 zone is 10,000 square feet. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
13. A "meeting facility" is a permitted use in the single-
family residential zoning district (RS).
 
The Neighbors appealed to the circuit court in the
 
Circuit Court Cases seeking reversal and/or modification of the
 
Board's decisions.14
 
On August 25, 2010, HCF filed with the circuit court, 
and the Board and Planning Director joined, a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the case dismissed as moot. On October 25, 2010, the circuit court entered the Order Denying HCF's Motion to Dismiss. The circuit court determined that, because the motion to dismiss included material outside of the pleadings and outside the record on appeal, and review in an agency appeal is confined to the pleadings as set forth in the record on appeal, it would treat the motion as a motion for summary judgment. The circuit court ruled that a motion for summary judgment is not a proper motion in an appeal filed pursuant to HRS § 91-14 (2012) because such motion is inconsistent with the statute and Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 72. 
On January 5, 2011, the circuit court entered the
 
Circuit Court FOF/COL. The circuit court reversed in part the
 decisions of the Planning Director and the Board. In pertinent
 part, the circuit court concluded (citations and record
 references have been omitted):
 
30. 	To be an "existing" structure or an "existing" single
family residence as used in HRS § 205A-22 and HPC Rule
9-4(10)B (now 9-4(e)(2)), the structure must have been
constructed in accordance with applicable law at the
time it was built.
 
. . . . 
34. 	The proposed uses, activities and operations . . . to
Building "A" . . . go beyond "repair and maintenance"
within the meaning of HRS § 205A-22, exemption (6).
 
. . . .
 
14 The Notices of Appeal to the circuit court, all filed on April 9,
2010, identify Civ. No. 10-01-133K as the appeal of BOA 09-000089, Civ. No.
10-01-134K as the appeal of BOA 09-000091, and Civ. No. 10-01-135K as the
appeal of BOA 09-000092.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
37. 	Building "A," being remodeled to its present
configuration without a building permit and with no
inspections, is not an "existing" single-family
residence nor an "existing" structure within the
meaning of HRS § 205A-22 and the HPC Rules.
 
38. 	The Planning Director's and Board's decision that
Building "A" is not a development as defined by HRS
§ 205A-22 and the HPC Rules and is exempt from the SMA
process is in violation of statutory provisions; is
affected by other error of law; is clearly erroneous
in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial
evidence on the whole record and is arbitrary or
capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or
a clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion, as the
proposed uses, activities or operations constitute a
"development" as set forth in HRS § 205A-22 and HPC
Rule 9-4(10)A (now Rule 9-4(e)(1)) and no exemption
set forth in HRS § 205A-22 and HPC Rule 9-4(10)(B)(now
9-4(e)(2)) is applicable.
 
39. 	The Court reverses the decision of the Planning
Director and Board of Appeals exempting Buildings "A"
and "C" from the SMA process as set forth in the
Planning Director's decisions in her October 20, 2009
letter and determines the proposed uses, activities
and operations as set forth in HCF's Assessment
Application are a "development" within the meaning of
HRS § 205A-22.
 
40. 	Building "C," as currently configured and as
configured when assessed by the Planning
Director . . . is neither an "existing single-family
residence" nor an "existing structure" as defined by
HRS § 205A-22 and the HPC Rules.
 
41. 	The Planning Director's and Board's decision that
Building "C" is not a development as defined by HRS

On January 19, 2011, the Neighbors filed a motion for
 
award of attorneys' fees and costs under the PAGD.15 In a letter
 
dated March 15, 2011, the circuit court stated its jurisdiction
 
over the appeal had been divested due to HCF's and the Planning
 Director's filing of notices of appeal from the Circuit Court
 FOF/COL in CAAP-11-0000071 and CAAP-11-0000074. On March 28,
 2011, the Neighbors filed a motion for reconsideration of
 jurisdiction with the circuit court. On May 2, 2011, the circuit
 court granted in part and denied in part the Neighbors' motion. 
The circuit court granted the motion in so far as the court ruled
 it had jurisdiction to hear the motion for attorneys' fees and
 costs, but denied the motion for attorneys' fees and costs
 declaring "the facts of this case do not support an award of
 attorney fees and costs under the [PAGD.]" 
On May 2, 2011, the circuit court entered the Judgment
 
in favor of the Neighbors and against the Board, Planning
 Director and HCF, which: reversed the decisions that Buildings A
 and C were exempted from the SMA process; determined that the
 proposed uses, activities and operations were "development"
 within HRS § 205A-22; and dismissed all remaining appeals and
 claims. Given its ultimate rulings, the only case on which the
 circuit court reached the merits was Civ. No. 10-1-133K, the
 appeal related to the SMA exemptions for Buildings A and C.
IV. Discussion
 
A. Mootness of the Neighbors' Appeal
 
The circuit court ultimately did not rule upon the
 
propriety of the SMA Minor Permit or Final Plan Approval for
 Building B (apparently because these actions were rescinded by
 the Planning Director). However, the circuit court did address
 the merits of the exemptions for Buildings A and C. HCF contends
 this was error because all of the issues before the circuit court
 
15 The Neighbors requested fees and costs totaling $269,231.81. The
 
Neighbors' counsel filed a declaration attesting they had incurred $210,492.15
in fees and $11,488.22 in costs. Dagres filed a declaration in which he
declared that he expended $58,739.66 for the professional services of Klaus D.
Conventz as a real estate consultant.
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had been rendered moot by subsequent actions by the Planning
 
Director. HCF argues the circuit court erred in refusing to
 consider evidence of mootness that was outside the record or the
 pleadings in deciding HCF's HRCP Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss,
 denying said motion to dismiss, and also erred in denying HCF's
 motion to add evidence which would demonstrate mootness.
 
The Neighbors argue that the circuit court did not err
 
because there is no indication the circuit court refused to
 consider the identified evidence outside the record, review of an
 agency decision is limited to the record on appeal, the evidence
 before the circuit court did not demonstrate mootness as to the
 exemptions, and, in general, revocation of the SMA Permit and
 Final Plan Approval as to Building B had no effect on the
 exemptions for Buildings A and C. Further, the Neighbors argue
 that if the exemptions for Buildings A and C are not reviewed
 here, HCF could dodge judicial review by merely refiling new or
 revised applications, forcing the Neighbors to expend countless
 amounts to repeatedly challenge new decisions. 
Although the parties frame the mootness issue in terms 
of whether it should have been analyzed under procedures for a motion to dismiss as opposed to a motion for summary judgment, and the circuit court appears to have addressed the issue in this context, such an approach is misplaced. "[M]ootness is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction." Hamilton ex rel. Letham v. 
Lethem, 119 Hawai
'i 1, 4, 193 P.3d 839, 842 (2008). "[T]he issue 
of subject matter jurisdiction can be properly raised at any time." Garner v. State, 122 Hawai
'i 150, 168 n.15, 223 P.3d 215, 
233 n.15 (App. 2009). "The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action." Hoku Lele, LLC v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 129 Hawai
'i 164, 166, 296 P.3d 1072, 
1074 (App. 2013) (citation omitted). 
It is well-settled that the mootness doctrine encompasses
the circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a case
previously suitable for determination. A case is moot where
 the question to be determined is abstract and does not rest
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on existing facts or rights. Thus, the mootness doctrine is
properly invoked where "events ... have so affected the
relations between the parties that the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal—adverse interest and
effective remedy—have been compromised."

'i 
391, 404-05, 235 P.3d 1103, 1116-17 (2010) (holding proponent of mootness failed to establish the claim as moot). 
To carry this burden, the proponent must be permitted 
to bring evidence to the court's attention. See Princeton Cmty., 
582 F.2d at 710. The court can and should consider evidence outside of the record for the purpose of determining mootness. See
 AIG Hawai 'i Ins. v. Bateman, 82 Hawai 'i 453, 459, 923 P.2d 
395, 401 (1996) (indicating that the parties should have disclosed a settlement that did not appear in the record, and if they had done so the court likely would have dismissed the appeal as moot); 
Wong v. Bd. of Regents
, 62 Haw. 391, 396, 616 P.2d 201,

during the pendency of appeal); Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet,
 
123 Hawai 'i 500, 508, 236 P.3d 1236, 1244 (App. 2010) ("We 
conclude that events occurring after the circuit court's entry of its Final Judgment have rendered Defendants' challenge to the circuit court's grant of declaratory relief moot."). 
HCF asserts that review of the exemptions pertaining to
 
Buildings A and C are moot because, instead of the original SMA
 exemption for Buildings A and C, there is a new SMA exemption for
 Building A and an amended exemption for Building C which ruined
 the justiciability of the original exemption. The pertinent
 facts for consideration of the mootness issue are as follows.
 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In a letter dated August 24, 2010, HCF requested that
 
the Planning Director rescind and revoke the SMA Minor Use Permit
 
and Final Plan Approval for Building B. Further, attached to
 another letter dated August 24, 2010, HCF submitted a new SMA Use
 Permit Assessment Application (August 2010 Assessment
 Application) requesting a SMA exemption for revised proposals to
 Building A. The revised proposals sought to have Building B
 become an "as-built family room" for Building A by connecting
 those buildings.
 
In a letter dated August 27, 2010, the Planning
 
Director revoked the SMA Minor Use Permit and Final Plan Approval
 for Building B. Further, in a letter dated September 27, 2010,
 the Planning Director informed HCF that a SMA exemption
 (September 2010 SMA Exemption) had been approved for the
 proposals in the August 2010 Assessment Application for Building
 B to be a family room for Building A. Neither this letter nor
 any other action by the Planning Director rescinded its prior
 action as to Building A.
 
In a letter dated September 20, 2010, HCF
 
"supplement[ed] and clarifie[d] the proposed activities to
 Building C[,]" but did not submit a new assessment application. 
In a letter dated October 6, 2010, the Planning Director
 determined that the amended proposed activities regarding
 Building C were still exempt, subject to the conditions of the
 initial SMA exemption. 
The Neighbors, HCF, and the Planning Director agree
 
that the specific issues related to the SMA Minor Permit and
 Final Plan Approval for Building B are moot. The circuit court,
 in effect, dismissed the appeals related to these issues as part
 of the Judgment. HCF asserts, however, that the appeals related
 to the exemptions for Buildings A and C are similarly mooted and
 
18
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(h)(3).16
 
Despite HCF's efforts to focus on the new or amended
 
exemptions, HCF has failed to establish that the exemptions for
 Buildings A and C set forth in the Planning Director's
 October 20, 2009 letter are no longer valid, or that the
 justiciability of the issues related to these exemptions has been
 compromised.
17
 
HCF acknowledged "existing entitlements" in its
 
subsequent August 2010 Assessment Application that exempt
 Buildings A and C from the definition of "development." 
Moreover, there is nothing in the record or which HCF sought to
 add to the record that demonstrates the original exemptions under
 the October 20, 2009 letter were relinquished, revoked or
 rescinded or that HCF requested such action. In fact, when the
 Planning Director acknowledged HCF's amended plans for Building
 C, information which "supplement[ed] and clarifie[d]" HCF's
 proposed activities, it was processed under the same application
 number as the October 2009 Assessment Application. In briefing,
 HCF only states without explanation that it would be "ludicrous"
 to suggest HCF would still use the October 2009 SMA exemptions
 after issuance of the September 2010 SMA exemption for Building A
 and the amended exemption for Building C. 
HCF has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that
 
the appeals regarding the exemptions to Buildings A and C are
 moot. Moreover, although issues specific to the SMA Minor Permit
 and Final Plan Approval for Building B are moot, in evaluating
 the issues regarding the exemptions for Buildings A and C, we
 review the entire proposal as submitted in the October 2009
 Assessment Application because that is what the Planning Director
 
16 HRCP Rule 12(h)(3) provides "[w]henever it appears by suggestion of
the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject
matter, the court shall dismiss the action."
17 The Planning Director's revocation of the SMA Minor Use Permit and
the Final Plan Approval only dealt with the proposed use of Building B.

HRS § 91-14.
B. SMA Exemptions for Buildings A and C
1. Standard of Review
 
As a secondary appeal,
 
[t]he standard of review is one in which this court must
determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in
its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91­14(g) to the agency's decision. This court's review is
further qualified by the principle that the agency's
decision carries a presumption of validity and appellant has
the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that the
decision is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in
its consequences.
 
HRS § 91-14(g) (1993) enumerates the standards of
review applicable to an agency appeal and provides:
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
An agency's findings of fact are reviewable under the
clearly erroneous standard to determine if the agency
decision was clearly erroneous in view of reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record.
 
An agency's conclusions of law (COLs) are freely
reviewable to determine if the agency's decision was
in violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions, in excess of statutory authority or
jurisdiction of agency, or affected by other error of
law.
 
A COL that presents mixed questions of fact and law is
reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because
the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. When mixed
questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate
court must give deference to the agency's expertise
and experience in the particular field. [T]he court
 
20
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
should not substitute its own judgment for that of the
agency.

392-93, 978 P.2d 822, 830-31 (1999) (citations and internal
 
quotation marks omitted).
 
As to statutory construction and interpreting
 
administrative rules,
 
[t]he general principles of construction which apply to
statutes also apply to administrative rules. As in
 statutory construction, courts look first at an
administrative rule's language. If an administrative rule's
 language is unambiguous, and its literal application is
neither inconsistent with the policies of the statute the
rule implements nor produces an absurd or unjust result,
courts enforce the rule's plain meaning.

interpretation of its own rules is entitled to deference unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose." In re Doe Children, 105 Hawai
'i 38, 53, 93

2. Exemptions 6 and 15 Do Not Apply
 
The Planning Director and HCF contend that the circuit
 
court erred in reversing the decisions of the Planning Director
 and the Board to exempt the proposed actions to Buildings A and C
 from the definition of "development," which would exempt those
 proposals from further SMA review. In her October 20, 2009
 letter, the Planning Director determined that the proposed
 activity to Buildings A and C was not "development" because
 HRS § 205A-22 and Rule 9-4(10)(B) establish exemptions for
 "repair[s], maintenance or interior alterations to existing
 structures[.]" HRS § 205A-22(6); HPC Rule 9-4(10)(B)(vi)
 (Exemption 6). The Board also relied upon Exemption 6 in its
 FOF/COL. Additionally, the circuit court found, and no party
 contests, that during testimony before the Board, the Planning
 Director stated she also granted the exemptions because she found
 the proposed activity to Buildings A and C expressly exempt under
 the exemption for "[s]tructural and non-structural improvements
 to existing single-family residences, where otherwise
 
21
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
permissible[.]" HRS § 205A-22(14); HPC Rule 9-4(10)(B)(xv)
 
(Exemption 15).
 
In reversing the Planning Director and the Board's
 
exemptions for Buildings A and C, the circuit court concluded
 that the proposed actions as to Building A went beyond the
 "repair and maintenance" allowed under Exemption 6, and that, as
 to both Buildings A and C, each was not an "existing structure"
 within the meaning of Exemption 6 or an "existing single-family
 residence" within the meaning of Exemption 15. 
For the reasons discussed below, we agree that
 
Exemptions 6 and 15 do not apply to either Building A or Building
 C.
 
a. Building A
 
In its October 2009 Assessment Application, HCF 
proposed "interior and exterior renovations (including a new kitchen)" to Building A. The circuit court made factual findings, uncontested by the parties, that the proposed work to Building A included adding an ADA bathroom and ramp that would increase the building's footprint. "Findings of fact . . . that are not challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate court." Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai
'i 450, 458, 
40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). 
The proposed scope of work for Building A went beyond 
the type of work encompassed in Exemption 6. "[W]here the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, [a court's] only duty is to give effect to [the statute's] plain and obvious meaning." State v. Wells, 78 Hawai
'i 373, 376, 894 P.2d 70, 73 
(1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
The plain language of Exemption 6 exempts "repair,
 
maintenance, or interior alterations to existing structures[.]"18
 
Exterior alterations that are not "repair" or "maintenance" are
 
18 The part of Exemption 6 dealing with "repair, maintenance or
interior alterations . . . . relating to existing uses" is not pertinent to
our analysis, because HCF and Planning Director only argue Exemption 6 applies
because Buildings A and C are "existing structures" and no party challenges
the circuit court's FOFs 26 and 28 that both Buildings A and C have not been
used for any purpose for a period of at least two years.
 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
not covered by the exemption. "Repair" means to "restore by
 
replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken."
 Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1923 (1981). In
 turn, "maintenance" means "[t]he care and work put into property
 to keep it operating and productive; general repair and upkeep." 
Black's Law Dictionary 1097 (10th ed. 2014). The addition of an
 ADA bathroom and ramp, which increases the building's footprint,
 does not constitute either repair or maintenance. The circuit
 court was thus correct in concluding that the proposed work to
 Building A went beyond the scope of work contemplated by the
 plain language of Exemption 6 for "repair, maintenance, or
 interior alterations"
19 and thus Exemption 6 does not apply to
 
Building A.
 
Additionally, Building A is not a "single-family
 
residence" within the meaning of Exemption 15. As acknowledged
 in the Planning Director's October 20, 2009 letter approving the
 SMA exemption, the proposed renovations to Building A were to
 "return the structure back to a single-family dwelling use."
 (Emphasis added.) This included adding a "new kitchen." 
Moreover, the circuit court found, and it is uncontested, that by
 1982, any kitchen in Building A (if there ever was a kitchen) had
 been removed. Thus, by the time the SMA assessment application
 was submitted to the Planning Director in October 2009, Building
 A had no kitchen. 
The definition of "single-family residence" in HPC Rule
 
9-4(21) states that the building must be "designed for and/or
 used as the complete facility for cooking, sleeping and living
 area of a single family only and occupied by no more than one
 
19 "Legislative history may be used to confirm interpretation of a
statute's plain language." E&J Lounge Operating Co. v. Liquor Comm'n of City
& Cnty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai' i 320, 335, 189 P.3d 432, 447 (2008) (citation
omitted). When initially enacted in 1975, HRS Chapter 205A only contained one
exemption: "Development does not include construction, repairs or maintenanceof a single family residence which is not part of a larger development." 1975 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 176, § 1 at 385-86. In 1979, the legislature added moreexemptions, including the relevant portion here, to "deal with activitieswhich are minor, routine or with activities which are not the type that shouldbe subject to a permit procedure[.]" S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 936, in 1979Senate Journal, at 1435; 1979 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 200, § 7 at 418-19. 
23
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
family." (Emphasis added.) Without a kitchen, Building A did not
 
meet the requirements for a single-family residence when the
 assessment application was submitted.
20 The circuit court
 
correctly concluded that Building A was not an "existing single-
family residence."
 
For the reasons stated above, Exemptions 6 and 15 do
 
not apply to the actions proposed for Building A. The decision
 by the Planning Director and the Board to exempt the Building A
 proposals from further SMA review under these exemptions was in
 violation of statutory provisions, affected by other error of
 law, and clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,
 and substantial evidence on the whole record. HRS § 91-14(g)(1),
 (4), (5).
 
In light of our discussion above, we need not consider
 
the other grounds relied upon by the circuit court in reversing
 the Planning Director and the Board's decision to exempt the
 proposed actions for Building A from the definition of
 "development."
 
b. Building C
 
The written decisions by the Planning Director and the
 
Board implicitly conclude that Building C was an "existing
 structure," but do not provide a clear explanation for the basis
 of this conclusion. At most, the Planning Director's October 20,
 2009 letter states as to Building C that "[s]ince the dwelling
 was legally constructed in 1970, the remodeling and renovation of
 this structure is exempt from the definition of 'development[.]'" 
In her testimony before the Board, the Planning Director
 elaborated and testified that when an application is filed, her
 office typically looks at real property tax records to see what
 structures are on the property, and those tax records usually
 
20 HCF argues that the circuit court did not consider that Building A
may have been a "nonconforming structure" which was grandfathered under the
County Zoning Code, so did not require a kitchen. First, HCF does not
indicate where it raised this argument before the circuit court or point to
any evidence supporting it. Second, being grandfathered under the Zoning Code
does not automatically mean that a structure complies with the definition of
"single-family residence" specifically provided in HPC Rule 9-4(21) as to SMA
review.
 
24
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
indicate whether a building permit has been pulled and the use of 
the building for tax purposes. She further testified that in determining whether there is an existing structure, she and her staff look at whether the building is physically existing by reviewing the real property tax records, but they do not look at permits from the County of Hawai
'i building department. She also 
indicated that, because there have been different codes over time, i.e. there was no SMA law in 1960 and the zoning code was different in 1960, "we look at when a building is physically put on the ground." 
The circuit court concluded that because Buildings A
 
and C had been substantially renovated without building permits,
 they are not "existing" for purposes of qualifying for the SMA
 exemptions. The Planning Director and HCF argue that the circuit
 court erred as to its interpretation of whether a structure was
 "existing," asserting that "existing" as used in the SMA laws
 does not require continued compliance with building permits
 because inter alia the Planning Director possesses no authority
 to enforce the building code. 
No party contests the circuit court's FOF 18 that
 
"[s]ince 1961, without any buildings permits, Building 'C' was
 expanded with extensions and additions in excess of 100% of its
 original footprint to a present floor plan of 1,884 square feet."
 (Emphasis added.) Therefore, Building C clearly was not properly
 permitted at the time HCF filed the October 2009 Assessment
 Application. Indeed, it was more than twice the size of what had
 been permitted in 1961. Although HRS Chapter 205A and HPC Rule 9
 provide no definition for an "existing structure" or "existing
 single-family residence" -- the relevant phrases under Exemptions
 6 and 15 -- we conclude that given the purpose of HRS Chapter
 205A, "existing" cannot simply mean physically existing or that
 an original structure was permitted but has since been
 drastically altered.

previously limited construction of statutory language where literal interpretation was inconsistent with the statute's purpose. Id. at 103-04, 194 P.3d at 544-45. If "existing" merely meant physically present or only
 
that at some point an original structure was permitted, the
 result would be obviously inconsistent with the purposes of
 Chapter 205A, Part II. The express purpose for designating and
 regulating SMAs was to place special controls on land use within
 the area along the shoreline to "preserve, protect, and where
 possible, to restore the natural resources of the coastal zone of
 Hawaii."
21 HRS § 205A-21. Further, the legislature mandates
 
that "[n]o development shall be allowed in any county within the
 special management area without obtaining a permit in accordance
 with this part." HRS § 205A-28. Yet, as evidenced by the facts
 of this case, if "existing" as to Building C merely means
 physical presence on the land or that an original structure was
 permitted but it has since doubled in size, HCF would be allowed
 to significantly expand a structure in violation of the
 applicable building code, or the requirements of SMA regulations,
 
21 In its entirety, HRS § 205A-21 provides
 
HRS § 205A-21 Findings and purposes. The legislature
finds that, special controls on developments within an area
along the shoreline are necessary to avoid permanent losses
of valuable resources and the foreclosure of management
options, and to ensure that adequate access, by dedication
or other means, to public owned or used beaches, recreation
areas, and natural reserves is provided. The legislature
finds and declares that it is the state policy to preserve,
protect, and where possible, to restore the natural
resources of the coastal zone of Hawaii.
 
26
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
propose subsequent alterations to the building, claim exemption
 
to SMA review as an "existing structure," and thus never undergo
 SMA review for the unpermitted construction. To allow such
 action outside the parameters of the SMA statutes and regulations
 is clearly inconsistent with the purpose of HRS Chapter 205A,
 Part II and HPC Rule 9.
 
Given the large scale expansion of Building C without
 
any permits, we cannot endorse the idea that it was an "existing
 structure" or an "existing single family residence" for purposes
 of exempting it from SMA review under Exemptions 6 and 15. 
Further, our interpretation of these phrases does not mean HCF is
 prohibited from taking any action as to Building C going forward. 
Rather, it simply means that Exemptions 6 and 15 do not apply to
 exempt the proposed actions to Building C from the definition of
 "development" and therefore the proposals are not exempt from SMA
 review on these grounds. Even if no other exemptions apply, HCF
 may proceed to seek permits through the SMA review process. See
 
HPC Rules 9-10 & 9-11.
 
The circuit court was thus correct in reversing the
 
decisions by the Planning Director and the Board to exempt the
 actions proposed for Building C from the definition of
 "development." The exemption of the proposed activity to
 Building C was in violation of HRS Chapter 205A, Part II and HPC
 Rule 9, and thus violated applicable statutory provisions and was
 affected by error of law. HRS § 91-14(g)(1), (4).
 
Given our discussion above, we need not address any
 
other issues related to whether the Building C proposals
 constitute "development." Specifically, we need not address
 whether the proposed action in the October 2009 Assessment
 Application would have a cumulative impact that would require it
 to be considered "development."
C. Proposed Actions Not Consistent with Zoning Code
 
In reversing the Planning Director and the Board, the
 
circuit court also based its decision on HRS § 205A-26(2)(C),
 which requires that no development be approved unless it is
 
27
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
determined that "the development is consistent with the
 
county . . . zoning." The circuit court ruled that HCF's
 October 2009 Assessment Application was not consistent with the
 zoning code for various reasons, and hence, HRS § 205A-26(2)(C)
 was violated.
 
We do not agree that HRS § 205A-26(2)(C) applies 
because the actions by the Planning Director and the Board were not to approve "development," but rather to determine that the proposed action was exempt from the definition of "development." Nonetheless, we believe that compliance with the County of Hawaii's zoning code remains a proper consideration for exempting proposed action from the definition of "development" and thus from SMA review. Chapter 25 of the Hawai
'i County Code (Zoning 
Code) § 25-2-1(b) (1983, republished 2005) provides that "[t]he director shall enforce all other provisions of [the Zoning Code] pertaining to land use." Further, § 25-2-2 expressly requires that 
[a]ll departments, officials, and public employees
authorized to issue permits or licenses shall conform to the
[Zoning Code] and no permit or license for any use,
building, or other purpose shall be issued where the license
or permit would be in conflict with the provisions of this
chapter. Any permit or license, if issued in conflict with
the [Zoning Code], shall be void.
 
No party offers a substantive challenge to the circuit
 
court's conclusion that the October 2009 Assessment Application
 
proposed three buildings with three uses on a property that is
 26,014 square-feet and zoned RS-10, and thus the proposal was
 inconsistent with the Zoning Code.
22
 
Per Zoning Code §§ 25-5-2 and 25-5-8, RS-10 means that
 
the single-family residential district requires ten thousand
 square-feet as a minimum building site area for each main
 
22 The conclusion is set forth in COL 11, which is challenged by HCF
only on grounds that the case is moot and the court should not have reached
the issue. HCF does not contend that its proposals for Buildings A, B, and C
complied with the Zoning Code.
 
28
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
building on a property.23 See Zoning Code § 25-4-31(a) ("Unless
 
otherwise specified in this chapter, each main building must be
 
located on a building site having not less than the established
 zoning district minimum building site area."). The Property, at
 26,014 square-feet, is permitted two single-family residences. 
Zoning Code § 25-5-8(a). Because HCF's proposal asserted that
 Buildings A and C would be single-family residences, Building B
 would have to be an accessory building, ohana dwelling, or a
 guest house.
24 Zoning Code §§ 25-5-3(c) and 25-5-8. Per the
 
October 2009 Assessment Application under review in this case,
 however, HCF did not propose Building B as an accessory building,
 ohana dwelling, or a guest house, but rather specifically
 proposed Building B as a "meeting facility for classroom
 activities and church related functions, with no overnight
 accommodation."
 
The proposals in the October 2009 Assessment
 
Application did not comply with the Zoning Code; not because of
 any church-related activities, but because Building B was not
 proposed as an accessory to the two proposed single-family
 dwellings. Thus, although we rely on a different provision to
 consider compliance with the Zoning Code, the circuit court was
 correct that the decisions by the Planning Director and the Board
 
23 During her testimony before the Board, Leithead-Todd responded to
questions regarding how three separate buildings could be authorized on the
Property by explaining that she only focused on the status of a meeting
facility as a permitted use, and that "we've approved multiple buildings on
single family residential. We've approved detached buildings on single family
residential. As long as it has the setbacks we don't look at those numbers."
24 Per § 25-1-5(b),
 
"Accessory building" means a building, no more than twenty
feet in height, detached from and subordinate to a main
building or main use on the same building site and used for
the purposes customarily incidental to those of the main
building or use.
. . . .
 
"Guest house" means an accessory building used as sleeping
quarters for guests of the occupants of the main dwelling
and having no cooking facilities.
. . . .
 "Ohana dwelling" means a second dwelling unit permitted to
be built as a separate or an attached unit on a building
site, but does not include a guest house or a farm dwelling.
 
29
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were affected by error of law because HCF's proposal did not
 
comply with the Zoning Code.
D. Judicial Taking
 
HCF argues that the circuit court's reversal of the 
Planning Director's and Board's decisions to exempt Buildings A and C amounted to a judicial taking. HCF contends that the buildings on the Property went from being taxed by the county and in the county's records, to being no longer legally "existing." HCF asserts that the circuit court's decision ran counter to established case law, namely Waikiki Marketplace Investment Company v. Chair of Zoning Board Of Appeals of City & County of Honolulu, 86 Hawai
'i 343, 949 P.2d 183 (App. 1997), and thus 
amounted to a retroactive alteration of state law that constitutes an unconstitutional taking. See Ryan v. Tanabe 
Corp., 97 Hawai
'i 305, 315, 37 P.3d 554, 564 (App. 1999). HCF 
also asserts that the circuit court's decision deprived the Property of all economically viable use and is thus an unconstitutional taking of property. 
HCF's arguments are without merit. Even if we were to 
assume that HCF posits a viable judicial taking theory, the circuit court's decision was not a retroactive alteration of state law. In Waikiki Marketplace, this court merely held that a property owner "should not have been required to produce a building permit in order to establish that [an] addition was a 'nonconforming structure' or 'nonconforming use'" under the applicable land use ordinance because terms such as "lawful use" and "previously lawful" as used in the land use ordinances only refer to compliance with previous zoning laws. 86 Hawai
'i at 
356, 949 P.2d at 196. The instant matter did not involve whether HCF could demonstrate status as a "nonconforming structure" or "nonconforming use" under the Zoning Code. 
Further, HCF's assertion that the Property has been
 
deprived of all economically viable use or of an existing
 structure is without merit. HCF is merely required to undergo
 further SMA review of the proposed activity. 
30
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
E. Other Issues on Appeal
 
Because we agree with the circuit court that the
 
Planning Director and the Board improperly relied on Exemptions 6
 
and 15, we need not address whether the activity proposed in the
 October 2009 Assessment Application would have a cumulative
 impact that would require the activity to be considered
 "development." We further need not reach the issue of whether an
 EA or EIS was required in this case as part of the Planning
 Director's review of the October 2009 Assessment Application. 
Lastly, while we hold that the proposed action as
 
contained in the October 2009 Assessment Application did not
 comply with the Zoning Code, we do so only on the issue of the
 number of buildings in relation to the required square footage. 
We need not address, and therefore, express no opinion in regard
 to, the issue of a meeting facility used by a church and any
 potential requirement to obtain a use permit under the Zoning
 Code.
 
F. Neighbors' Request for Attorneys' Fees and Costs
1. PAGD
 
The Neighbors contend that the circuit court erred by 
denying their requests for attorneys' fees and costs based on the court's conclusion that the facts of this case do not support an award under the PAGD. The Neighbors rely on Sierra Club v. Department of Transportation of the State of Hawai
'i, 120 Hawai 'i 
181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009), and In re Water Use Permit Applications, 96 Hawai
'i 27, 25 P.3d 802 (2001) (Wai ahole II). 
Traditionally, we review the denial and granting of attorneys' fees under the abuse of discretion standard. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. 
of Emps.' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai
'i, 106 Hawai 'i 416, 431, 
106 P.3d 339, 354 (2005). "An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. (citations 
omitted). As to PAGD, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has further 
indicated that "[w]e retain the abuse of discretion standard, 
31
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
noting however that we review de novo whether the trial court 
disregarded rules or principles of law that arise in deciding whether or not a party satisfies the three factors of the private attorney general doctrine." Honolulu Constr. & Draying Co. v. 
Dept. of Land & Natural Resources, 130 Hawai
'i 306, 313, 310 P.3d 
301, 308 (2013). 
The Neighbors fail to demonstrate that the circuit
 
court abused its discretion or erred in considering their request
 for attorneys' fees and costs under the PAGD. "Courts applying
 the [PAGD] consider three basic factors: (1) the strength or
 societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the
 litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the
 magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, and (3) the
 number of people standing to benefit from the decision." Id. at
 
308, 310 P.3d at 303 (citation, brackets, and emphasis omitted). 
The Neighbors assert they have vindicated important public policy
 in the form of the environmental requirements of the Coastal Zone
 Management Act, HRS Chapter 205A. 
In Goo v. Arakawa, 132 Hawai
'i 304, 321 P.3d 655 
(2014), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that the third prong of 
the PAGD was not satisfied and thus a request for attorneys' fees was properly denied. Id. at ___, 321 P.3d at 670-71. In Goo, 
neighboring homeowners challenged the County of Maui's decision to exempt certain development projects from a height restriction law. In regards to whether the PAGD applied to the circumstances of the case, the supreme court noted that "[t]his case . . . did not involve the enforcement of law of general state-wide applicability, did not benefit a substantial number of people on a scale comparable to decisions such as [Sierra Club] or [Wai
ahole II], and lacks general precedential value." Id. at __, 
321 P.3d at 670. 
Here, although we are addressing legal issues under the
 
SMA, the decision in this case is fact specific and will not
 benefit substantial numbers of people. See id. The circuit
 
court's Judgment was specific to the exemptions granted for
 
32
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Buildings A and C, as well as the particular structures on the 
Property. The Neighbors do not demonstrate that they satisfy all prongs of the test for obtaining fees and costs under the PAGD. Wai
ahole II, 96 Hawai 'i at 31, 25 P.3d at 806 (holding that a 
party did not satisfy the PAGD test even though it met two of the three prongs). The circuit court thus did not err in denying the Neighbors' request for fees and costs pursuant to the PAGD.
2. Taxation of Costs
 
In their opening brief, the Neighbors also assert that 
the circuit court abused its discretion in denying taxation of costs against HCF and the Planning Director as non-prevailing parties pursuant to HRS § 607-9 and HRCP Rule 54(d)(1). The Neighbors assert that the circuit court failed to provide an explanation for its denial of costs, and particularly, expert witness costs. However, we note that the Neighbors did not present these issues in their "Statement of Points of Error" section, and failed to indicate where in the record the alleged error was objected to or brought to the attention of the court as required by Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4). Thus, these issues are waived. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4). 
Even if these issues were not waived, in their motion
 
for attorneys' fees and costs before the circuit court, the
 Neighbors only cited to HRS § 607-9, not HRCP Rule 54(d)(1), and
 only requested recovery of costs for an expert witness in their
 motion. However, "expert witness fees are not taxable as costs,
 absent a statute specifically allowing such an expense." Mist v.
 Westin Hotels, Inc., 69 Haw. 192, 202, 738 P.2d 85, 92 (1987). 
The Neighbors cite to no statute which allows such taxation.
V. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court of
 
the Third Circuit's Final Judgment filed on May 2, 2011, to the
 
extent that it reverses the decisions of the Planning Director
 and the Board to exempt the proposed action to Buildings A and C
 from the SMA process and to the extent that it is based on the
 
33
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasons set forth in this opinion. We do not reach the other
 
grounds relied upon by the circuit court in the Circuit Court
 FOF/COL filed on January 5, 2011.
 
We also affirm the denial of the Neighbors' requests
 
for attorneys' fees and costs as set forth in the circuit court's
 order filed on May 2, 2011.
