IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DONALD LEVELL, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 1P110-10648)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Donald Levell, Jr. (Levell) appeals
 
from the Judgment filed on January 12, 2011 in the District Court
 
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division 1 (district court).
 
The district court found Levell guilty of Harassment,
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1106(1)(a)
 
(Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, Levell contends the district court abused
 
its discretion in prohibiting him from attacking Complainant's
 
credibility by evidence of her bias, interest, or motive, in
 
violation of Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 404(b) and
 
609.1.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Levell's appeal is without merit.
 
Introduction of Complainant's alleged credit card theft 
from Levell after the alleged harassment occurred was subject to 
exclusion by HRE Rule 403 after a "cost-benefit calculus and a 
delicate balance between probative value and prejudicial effect." 
State v. Balisbisana, 83 Hawai' i 109, 114, 924 P.2d 1215, 1220 
(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Exclusion of relevant evidence is reviewed for an abuse of 
discretion. State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 404, 56 P.3d 692, 
706 (2002). "An abuse of discretion occurs when the court clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant." State v. St. Clair, 101 Hawai' i 280, 286, 67 P.3d 
779, 785 (2003) (quoting Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i at 404, 56 P.3d at 
706). The district court does not abuse its discretion when the 
trier of fact possesses "sufficient information to appraise the 
biases and motivations of the witness." Balisbisana, 83 Hawai' i 
at 114, 924 P.2d at 1220 (quoting United States v. Easter, 66 F.3d 1018, 1022-23 (9th Cir. 1995)). In the instant case, there 
was no abuse of discretion in prohibiting Levell from raising 
Complainant's alleged theft of his credit card after the alleged 
harassment occurred. 
Even if there was error by the district court, it was 
harmless error because Levell's own testimony provided 
substantial evidence in addition to Complainant's testimony to 
support his conviction. See State v. Mars, 116 Hawai' i 125, 139, 
170 P.3d 861, 875 (App. 2007). Levell testified that he never had physical contact with Complainant on the day in question, and 
yet after Complainant left the apartment, he testified that he 
went downstairs, saw Complainant with a police officer and said 
"I'm probably the gentleman that you--that you're looking 
for[.]".
