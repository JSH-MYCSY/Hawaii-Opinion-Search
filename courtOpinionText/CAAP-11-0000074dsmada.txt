APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 10-01-133K; 10-1-134K; 10-1-135K)
 
ORDER DENYING APRIL 21, 2011 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Appellants-Appellees John F. Dagres and
 
Judith Fitzgerald's (Appellees) April 21, 2011 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000071 for lack of
 jurisdiction, (2) Appellees-Appellants County of Hawai' i Planning 
Department and Bobby Jean Leithead-Todd, Director of the Planning 
Department of the County of Hawai' i's (the County of Hawai' i 
Appellants) April 29, 2011 memorandum in opposition to Appellees’ April 21, 2011 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000071 for lack of jurisdiction, (3) Appellee-Appellee County of Hawai' i Board of Appeals' May 2, 2011 statement of no 
position as to Appellees’ April 21, 2011 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000071 for lack of jurisdiction, (4) the Honorable Ronald Ibarra's subsequent entry of a final judgment in this case on May 2, 2011, pursuant to Rule 72(k) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
(5) the record, it appears that we have jurisdiction over this
 appeal pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-15 (1993),
 HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2010) and HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 2010).
 
"Review of any final judgment of the circuit court
 
under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." HRS § 91­15. The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
 
hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
 are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1). The law provides that
 "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final
 judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS
 § 641-1(a). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the
 
-2­manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­
1
1(c). HRCP Rule 72(k)  requires that, upon a circuit court's
determination of an administrative appeal, "the court having 
jurisdiction shall enter judgment." 
HRCP Rule 72(k). We apply 
the separate judgment document rule set forth in 
Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), 
to an administrative appeal before a circuit court. See, e.g., 
Raquinio v. Nakanelua, 77 Hawai' i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 
1995). Under the separate judgment document rule, "[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Consequently, "an 
order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and 
Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) 
(citation omitted; emphasis added). 
On May 2, 2011, the circuit court entered a final 
judgment in this case pursuant to HRCP Rule 72(k) that appears to resolve all claims in this case. The County of Hawai' i 
1
 Rule 81(e) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure requires that
the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall apply to any proceedings in a
circuit court pursuant to appeal to the circuit court from a governmental
official or body (other than a court), except as otherwise provided in Rule72." 
-3­Appellants' February 7, 2011 notice of appeal was premature, but 
Rule 4(a)(2) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
authorizes a premature appeal under the circumstances of this case. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees’ April 21, 2011
 
motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000071 for lack of
 jurisdiction is denied.
