ONEWEST BANK FSB, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LAC HOILIEN, Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-50 AND JANE DOES 1-50, Defendants-Appellees.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(DC-CIVIL NO. 10-1-2647)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lac Hoilien (Hoilien) appeals from
 
the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession, both filed
 
January 24, 2011 and entered by the District Court of the Second
 
Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court) in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Onewest Bank FSB (Onewest Bank).1 We affirm. 
On July 27, 2010, Onewest Bank filed its Verified
 
Complaint for Ejectment against Hoilien. Onewest Bank alleged
 
that it was the fee simple owner of the subject property by
 
virtue of a non-judicial foreclosure sale held on March 19, 2010,
 
and the subsequent recording on July 12, 2010 of a Quitclaim Deed
 
in the Bureau of Conveyances. The complaint asserted that

Hoilien was unlawfully occupying the subject property without
 
Onewest Bank's consent or permission and despite written notice
 
to vacate, and therefore prayed for inter alia a Judgment for
 
Possession and a Writ of Possession.
 
On September 15, 2010, Onewest Bank filed a Motion for
 
Summary Judgment for Ejectment and Writ of Possession. On
 
September 16, 2010, Hoilien filed a Motion for Summary Judgment,
 
seeking an order invalidating the auction sale of the property,
 
an order cancelling the quitclaim deed, and an award of
 
attorney's fees and costs.
 
On January 13, 2011, the District Court entered an:
 
(1) order granting Onewest Bank's motion for summary judgment for
 
ejectment and writ of possession (Order Granting Onewest Bank's
 
MSJ); and (2) order denying Hoilien's motion for summary judgment
 
(Order Denying Hoilien's MSJ). On January 24, 2011, the District
 
Court entered a Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession in
 
favor of Onewest Bank.
 
On appeal, Hoilien argues that the District Court erred
 
by issuing the Order Granting Onewest Bank's MSJ, the Order
 
Denying Hoilien's MSJ, and the Judgment for Possession and Writ
 
of Possession. Hoilien contends that Onewest Bank lacked
 
standing to eject him because the underlying non-judicial
 
foreclosure sale, from which Onewest Bank derives its interest in
 
the property, is void for failure to comply with Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 667-5 to 667-10 (1993 Repl. and Supp. 2011). 
In particular, Hoilien argues that the non-judicial foreclosure
 
sale was void because Onewest Bank failed to make a downpayment
 
allegedly required pursuant to HRS § 667-5.7 (Supp. 2011), and
 
instead made a credit bid, which Hoilien argues is not permitted
 
under HRS § 667-5.7. Hoilien's challenge to the District Court's
 
judgment rests entirely on this point.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This court recently addressed this issue and held that
 
HRS § 667-5.7 "simply imposes a limitation on the downpayment
 
that can be demanded; it does not require that the successful
 
bidder make a downpayment or preclude the mortgagee from making a
 
credit bid." Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass'n v. Siangco, No. CAAP-10­
0000110, 2011 WL 3849841 (App. Aug. 31, 2011) (SDO); Winged Foot
 Invs., Inc. v. Jones, No. CAAP-10-0000021, 2011 WL 4537853 (App.
 
Sept. 30, 2011) (SDO); see also Angel v. BAC Home Loans
 
Servicing, LP, Civ. No. 10-00240 HG-BMK, 2011 WL 1230413 (D. Haw.
 
Mar. 30, 2011). Thus, we disagree with Hoilien's point of error
 
that Onewest Bank lacked standing to seek ejectment of Hoilien
 
because the non-judicial foreclosure was void. 
We affirm the Judgment of Possession and Writ of
 
Possession that were filed by the District Court on January 24,
 
2011.
