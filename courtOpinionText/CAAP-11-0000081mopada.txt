IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ABEL SIMEONA LUI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NOS. 3P810-73 and 3P810-74)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Abel Simeona Lui (Lui) appeals from
 
the January 26, 2011 "Notice of Entry of Judgment And/Or Order"
 
1
of the District Court of the Third Circuit  (district court)
convicting him of disorderly conduct in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1101 (Supp. 2011) and harassment in
 
violation of HRS § 711-1106 (Supp. 2011).
 
On appeal, Lui contends:
 (1) the district court violated his right to counsel
 
by forcing him to proceed to trial 
pro se without obtaining a
 
waiver of his right to counsel;
 
(2) there was no substantial evidence to support Lui's
 
conviction for disorderly conduct; and

(3) there was no substantial evidence to support Lui's
 
conviction for harassment where he did not possess the requisite
 
state of mind and/or where he acted in defense of property.
 
I.
 
Lui was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment 
by complaint filed March 30, 2010 by Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai'i (State). On April 14, 2010, he appeared before the 
district court without counsel and was arraigned on the charges. 
On May 12, 2010, Lui appeared before the district court
 
without counsel indicating he desired to represent himself. The
 State indicated it was making Lui a plea offer. Lui rejected the
 
plea offer and asked the district court to dismiss the case
 
(which was not done).
 
On July 14, 2010, Lui appeared before the district
 
court for trial without counsel, indicating he wanted to continue
 
to represent himself. The State had its witnesses present and
 
was ready to proceed. The district court engaged Lui in a
 
colloquy of Lui's waiver of right to counsel. Lui said he would
 
apply to the Office of the Public Defender (OPD). The trial date
 
was continued to November 17, 2010.
 
On November 17, 2010, Lui appeared again before the
 
district court for trial without counsel indicating he wished to
 
represent himself.
2 The State had its witnesses present and was
 
ready to proceed. But when asked whether he was waiving his
 right to counsel, Lui said no. He said he had found an attorney,
 
Gary Zamber (Zamber), who he wanted to hire. The court continued
 
the case to January 26, 2011 and informed Lui there would be no
 
further continuances.
 
On January 26, 2011, Lui appeared and informed the
 
district court he had hired Zamber, who could not appear with him
 
because Zamber had a court appearance in Hilo. The district
 
court called Zamber who said he would be willing to "assist" Lui
 
but said Lui had not hired him. Zamber told the court that he

2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had not been informed by Lui that there was a "firm trial date"
 
and that he could not appear because he was at another proceeding
 
in Hilo. When told by the district court that his trial would
 
then commence, Lui said fine.
 
II.
 
The question then is did the district court abuse its
 
discretion in not continuing Lui's trial date so he could be
 represented by Zamber.
 
The district court did not abuse its discretion in not 
continuing Lui's trial to yet another date. Neither Lui or 
Zamber requested a continuance. When the district court informed 
Lui "we're going to proceed to trial today," Lui responded 
"fine." In not continuing Lui's trial date a third time, the 
district court did not disregard a rule or principle of law or 
practice to substantial detriment of defendant. State v. 
Crisostomo, 94 Hawai' i 282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000). 
Lui waived his right to counsel in this case by his
 
continual inaction in failing to contact the OPD or secure
 private counsel despite repeated continuances and the district
 
court's advisement that January 26, 2011 was firm trial date with
 
no further continuances. See Peterson v. State, 196 Md. App.
 
563, 574, 10 A.3d 838, 845 (2010); State v. Johnson, 33 Wash. App
 15, 22-23, 651 P.2d 247, 252 (1982); United States v.
 
Merriweather, 376 F. Supp 944, 945 (1974).
 
III.
 
To be convicted of disorderly conduct, Lui must have
 
acted with the intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm by
 a member of the public or recklessly created a risk thereof. 
HRS § 711-1101. In finding Lui guilty, the court specified the
 
person engaged was the "member of the public" that had been
 
inconvenienced or alarmed.
 
The commentary of HRS § 711-1101, distinguishes the
 
offense of disorderly conduct, which involves conduct that
 
threatens the public generally from offenses such as assault,
 
which cause "private alarm." "Subsection (1)(a) is a standard
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clause in disorderly conduct legislation, aimed at actual fights
 
and at other behavior tending to threaten the public generally,
 
for this section requires public alarm, etc., as distinguished
 from the private alarm which may accompany assault." Commentary
 
on HRS § 711-1101 (1993 Repl.) (emphasis added).
 
This distinction is also in the commentary to the
 
harassment section in HRS § 711-1106, which states: "Harassment,
 
a petty misdemeanor, is a form of disorderly conduct aimed at a
 
single person, rather that at the public." Commentary on
 
HRS § 711-1106 (1993 Repl.).
 
In State v. Moser, 107 Hawai' i 159, 111 P.3d 54 (App. 
2005), this court held that there was insufficient evidence to 
support defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct because 
there was no evidence the defendant had "addressed anyone other 
than [the employee and the supervisor] on the occasion in 
question or intended to physically inconvenience or alarm any 
member of the public by speaking loudly." Moser, 107 Hawai' i at 
175, 111 P.3d at 70. Our holding in Moser confirms that the member or members of the public for purposes of the disorderly 
conduct statute must be persons other than the person(s) who are 
the direct target of the defendant's conduct, as was the case 
here. Lui's conduct was directed at and threatened a single 
person, and no other. 
Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to convict
 
Lui of disorderly conduct.
 
IV.
 
There was, however, sufficient evidence to convict Lui
 
of harassment, in that Lui with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm
 any other person, shoved or otherwised touched that person in an
 
offensive manner. HRS § 711-1106(1)(a).
 
The standard of review on appeal for sufficiency of the 
evidence is substantial evidence. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
long held that evidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution whenthe appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of suchevidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whether the case was before a judge or a jury. The test on
 
appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence
to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed,
even if it could be said in a bench trial that the
 conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as
there is substantial evidence to support the requisite
findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material
element of the offense charged is credible evidence
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge is
free to make all reasonable and rational inferences
 under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial
evidence.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931
(1992).
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). There was sufficient evidence that Lui intentionally 
harassed, annoyed and alarmed another person and touched that 
person in an offensive manner. 
V.
 
Therefore, the January 26, 2011 "Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment And/Or Order" of the District Court of the Third Circuit
 is vacated. Lui's conviction of disorderly conduct is reversed. 
His conviction of harassment is affirmed, and this case is
 
remanded for resentencing on the harassment charge.
