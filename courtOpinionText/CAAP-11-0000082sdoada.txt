IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF AB
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-J NO. 00-80244)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Arising out of the continued supervision and care of a
 
minor, AB, who was adjudicated as a law violator, Appellant
 
Department of Health (DOH) appeals from (1) the January 13, 2011
 "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Entered on
 September 20, 2010 Filed October 12, 2010 and Granting of
 Supervised Release" and (2) the September 20, 2010 "Order Re:
 Return One-Panel Fitness Hearing" entered by the Family Court of
 
1
the First Circuit (Family Court),  in which the Family Court
ordered the DOH to provide payment for AB's services and
 treatment.
 
On appeal, the DOH argues that the Family Court erred

 
because it (1) required the DOH to pay for AB's hospital-based
 treatment and services without proper subject matter jurisdiction
 and (2) relied upon a letter submitted by Thomas Cunningham,
 Ph.D. (Dr. Cunningham), as evidence justifying its order that the
 DOH continue AB's hospitalization until space was available in a
 DOH-approved residential program. In conjunction with these
 points, DOH challenges Findings of Fact 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, and

23 and Conclusion of Law 3.
 
No answering briefs have been filed.
 
Based on our review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the DOH, the authority cited and the record, we
 resolve the issues as follows.
 
DOH's appeal essentially challenges the Family Court's 
ability to order it to pay for services rendered by Queen's Medical Center's Family Treatment Center (Queen's) from July 28, 2010 onward. DOH maintains that the Family Court erred because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter orders requiring DOH to pay for hospital-based residential placement and "[t]here is no statutory provision authorizing the family court to order DOH to pay for [AB's] care at the hospital in this case without establishing a legal obligation to do so." Relying on In re Doe, 96 Hawai
'i 272, 30 P.3d 878 (2001), DOH argues that because the 
Family Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, it "cannot simply cite the best interests of the child to establish a legal basis to pay for the court ordered services." We agree. 
At the time of the filing of the petitions at issue
 
here, AB was on probation as a result of previously adjudicated
 petitions. In disposing of the instant petitions, the Family
 Court
 
ORDERED that pursuant to Section 704-411 HRS, the minor
shall be acquitted on the grounds of physical or mental
disease and lack of penal responsibility; that pursuant to
Section 704-413 HRS and 704-414 HRS.
 
1.	 The minor is continued on probation until the
further order of the court.
 
2.	 Over objection by the Department of Health, from
July 28, 2010 the Department of Health shall
bear the cost of the minor's placement until she
is placed at Julia House. If minor's mother has
paid for the cost of placement for the minor
since July 28,2010, she shall be reimbursed.
 
3.	 The trial previously set on 11/18/10 at
1:30 p.m. is set aside.
 
4.	 All prior consistent orders shall remain in full
force and effect.
 
The Family Court cited HRS §§ 704-411, -413 and -414
 
(2014) in its order. Assuming that the provisions regarding
 
Responsibility and Fitness in the Penal Code apply to the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
adjudication of a minor, neither HRS § 704-413 "Conditional
 
release; application for modification of discharge; termination
 of conditional release and commitment," nor HRS § 704-414
 "Procedure upon application for discharge, conditional release,
 or modification of conditions of release" apply to this case, as
 they provide for procedures after commitment. Moreover, where a
 person is found not guilty due to physical or mental disease,
 disorder or defect excluding responsibility, a hearing must be
 held to determine whether the person is still affected, presents
 a risk of danger to self or to others, and is not a proper
 subject for conditional release. HRS § 704-411. There is
 nothing in the record showing that such a hearing was held or
 that AB was committed to the custody of DOH pursuant to such a
 determination.
 
Alternatively, although HRS § 571-44 (2006) does
 
authorize examination and/or treatment for physical or mental
 issues of a "minor who has been adjudicated by the court[,]" our
 review of this record does not reveal that the Family Court
 entered such an order regarding AB. To the contrary, in the
 September 29, 2010 "Order re: Return One-Panel Fitness Hearing,"
 acquitting AB of the allegations in the Petitions, no
 accompanying order committing AB to the DOH or any mental or
 physical health professional appears. Rather, the Family Court
 continued AB on probation as ordered in previous petitions. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that, even under the 
broad authority granted by the Child Protective Act, HRS Chapter 587, the family court must have a legal basis upon which it issues orders to pay for treatment and services. 
The family court's jurisdiction is not so broad that it
extends to the ability to simply order anyone to pay for
needed services. Obviously, there must be a legal basis
establishing an obligation to pay
 
In re Doe, 96 Hawai 'i at 286, 93 P.3d 892. However, there is no 
indication in the record that the Family Court invoked its 
authority under HRS Chapter 587 or found evidence that AB had been harmed or was in danger of imminent harm. HRS § 587-11 (2006); HRS § 587A-5 (Supp. 2014).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on our review of the record and the authority 
cited by the parties below, DOH on appeal, and the Family Court, 
there does not appear to be authority, under the facts of this case, for the Family Court's order obligating the DOH to pay for the medical services provided by Queen's after July 28, 2010. Said order was in error. In re Doe, 96 Hawai
'i at 286, 93 P.3d 
892.
 
Our resolution of this issue makes it unnecessary to
 
address the other points of error raised by the DOH.
 
Therefore, paragraph 2 of the Family Court of the First
 
Circuit's September 20, 2010 "Order Re: Return One-Panel Fitness
 Hearing" ordering the Department of Health to pay for medical
 services rendered by Queen's to AB from July 28, 2010 is vacated. 
The order is affirmed in all other respects.
