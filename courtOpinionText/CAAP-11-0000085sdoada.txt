STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STEPHEN CRAMER, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0679(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Stephen Cramer, Jr. (Cramer)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed
 
January 11, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit1
 
(circuit court). The circuit court found Cramer guilty of (1)
 Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 2007);
 
(2) Prohibited Acts Related to Drug Paraphernalia, in violation
 
of HRS § 329-43.5(a) (1993); and (3) Promoting a Detrimental Drug
 
in the Third Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1249(1) (1993).
 
On appeal, Cramer contends:
 (1) The circuit court committed plain, reversible error
 
by denying Cramer's retained counsel's oral motion to substitute

for the deputy public defender and to continue the sentencing
 
hearing for three weeks to adequately prepare for the hearing.
 
(2) The circuit court abused its discretion by refusing
 
to sentence Cramer as a first-time drug offender under 
HRS § 706-622.5 (Supp. 2009).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Cramer's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err when it denied
 
Cramer's request to substitute counsel and continue the
 
sentencing hearing for three weeks. Cramer contends his state
 
and federal constitutional right to be represented by counsel of
 
his choice was violated. "[T]here is no absolute right,
 
constitutional or otherwise, for an indigent to have the court
 
order a change in court-appointed counsel." State v. Torres, 54
 
Haw. 502, 504, 510 P.2d 494, 496 (1973). The United States
 Supreme Court has "recognized a trial court's wide latitude in
 
balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of
 
fairness and against the demands of its calendar[.]" U.S. v.
 
Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 152 (2006) (internal citation
 omitted). "Generally, any request for continuance is to be
 
disposed of in the discretion of the trial judge. A denial of a
 
continuance is not per se a denial of the constitutional right to
 
counsel[.]" Torres, 54 Haw. at 504-05, 510 P.2d at 496. 
In our review of the circuit court's decision to deny a
 
continuance, we look to "whether . . . there was an abuse of
 
discretion that prejudiced the defendant by amounting to an
 
unconstitutional denial of the right to[] effective assistance of
 
counsel." Id. at 505, 510 P.2d at 496. And "where a defendant
 
is himself to blame for t[ar]diness of request for new 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
counsel . . . this fact is extremely significant in showing that
 
there was no abuse of discretion in failure to grant a requested
 
continuance." Id. at 507, 510 P.2d at 498. 
Here, Cramer was represented by counsel from the public
 
defender's office at the Drug Court termination hearing on 
August 19, 2010 and the Stipulated Facts trial on November 4,
 
2010. Not until the sentencing hearing on January 6, 2011 did
 
other counsel make an appearance and request substitution,
 
contingent on the circuit court's willingness to continue the
 
hearing for three weeks. Cramer provided no reason for the
 
request for new counsel and, on appeal, has not argued he was
 
prejudiced by the court's denial of a continuance to accommodate
 
appointment of new counsel. We conclude the circuit court did
 
not abuse its discretion in denying Cramer's oral motion for
 
substitution of counsel and a continuance.
 
(2) The circuit court did not err in refusing to
 
sentence Cramer under the sentencing statute for first-time drug
 
offenders, HRS § 706-622.52. A person convicted as a first-time
 
drug offender under HRS § 329.43.5 is eligible to be sentenced to
 probation under HRS § 706-622.5 if the person meets certain
 
criteria, including a determination by the court that the person
 
is nonviolent. HRS § 706-622.5(1)(a). 
In the instant case, the circuit court reviewed the
 
family court file that contained an order of protection issued
 
against Cramer. The family court had made a finding "that recent
 
conduct of [Cramer] included placing a family or household member
 
in fear of physical harm which constitutes family violence[.]" 
2
 HRS § 706-622.5 provides, in relevant part:
 
[A] person convicted for the first time for any offense
under section 329-43.5 . . . is eligible to be sentenced to
probation . . . if the person meets the following criteria:
 
(a)	 The court has determined that the person is nonviolent
after reviewing the person's criminal history, the
factual circumstances of the offense for which the
 person is being sentenced, and any other relevant
information[.]
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on the family court's finding that Cramer had engaged in
 
family violence, the circuit court determined it could not
 
conclude that Cramer was nonviolent as required under 
HRS § 706-622.5. Because Cramer was not eligible to be sentenced
 
to probation, the circuit court did not err in refusing to
 
sentence Cramer under HRS § 706-622.5. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed January 11, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the
 Second Circuit is affirmed.
