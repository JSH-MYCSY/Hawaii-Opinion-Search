  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On April 15, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i 
charged Shoreen Domingo (Domingo) with attempted theft in the 
second degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 708-831 (Supp. 2010) and 705-500 (1993). The circuit court 
set bail in the amount of $11,000. AOBB posted a bail bond for 
Domingo in the amount of $11,000. Domingo pled guilty. Domingo 
failed to appear in court for sentencing and the circuit court 
issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Domingo. On September 
13, 2010, the circuit court entered a bail forfeiture judgment 
against AOBB in the amount of $11,000.
 On October 19, 2010, AOBB filed a motion to set aside 
the September 13, 2010 bail forfeiture judgment which the circuit 
court denied orally on November 10, 2010 and by filed order on 
November 23, 2010. On November 16, 2010 AOBB filed a Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59 motion to reconsider the November 23, 2010 order denying AOBB's October 19, 2010 motion to 
set aside the September 13, 2010 bail forfeiture judgment. On 
February 2, 2010, the circuit court filed an order denying AOBB's 
November 16, 2010 HRCP Rule 59 motion to reconsider the November 
23, 2010 order denying AOBB's October 19, 2010 motion to set 
aside the September 13, 2010 bail forfeiture judgment. 
On appeal, AOBB contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in denying AOBB's November 10, 2010 oral motion to
 
continue the hearing on the motion to vacate the judgment and
 
order of forfeiture and in denying AOBB's motion to reconsider
 
the order denying AOBB's motion to vacate the judgment and order.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude AOBB's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in not
 
continuing the hearing on AOBB's motion to vacate the judgment
 
and order of forfeiture where AOBB's counsel represented Domingo

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would be at the hearing, Domingo did not appear and AOBB's 
counsel informed the circuit court he was unable to locate 
Domingo. Furthermore, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in not vacating the judgment and order, or in denying 
AOBB's motion for reconsideration, in that prior to the 
expiration of the thirty-day search period: AOBB failed to 
provide a satisfactory reason for Domingo's failure to appear 
when required at the September 8, 2010 sentencing hearing; and 
Domingo did not surrender nor was surrendered. State v. Ranger 
Ins. Co. By and Through James Lindblad, Inc. (A-1 Bail Bonds) 83 Hawai'i 118, 123, 925 P.2d 288, 293 (1996). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying Motion to
 
Vacate Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond Issued by
 Honorable Dexter Dean Del Rosario September 8, 2010" filed
 
November 23, 2010 and the "Order Denying Motion to Reconsider
 
Order Denying Motion to Vacate Judgment and Order of Forfeiture
 
of Bail Bond Issued by Honorable Dexter Dean Del Rosario on
 
September 8, 2010" filed February 2, 2011, both entered in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
