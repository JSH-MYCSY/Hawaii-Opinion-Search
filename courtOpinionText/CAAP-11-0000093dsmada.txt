DANIEL K.K. AWAI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SHAUNA MARIE AWAI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 06-1-2059)
ORDER GRANTING JUNE 16, 2011 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the June 16, 2011 motion by
Plaintiff-Appellee Daniel K.K. Awai (Appellee Daniel Awai) to
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000093 for lack of
appellate jurisdiction, (2) the June 21, 2010 memorandum by
Defendant-Appellant Shauna Marie Awai (Appellant Shauna Awai) in
opposition to Appellee Daniel Awai's June 16, 2011 motion to
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000093 for lack of
appellate jurisdiction, and (3) the record on appeal, it appears
that we lack jurisdiction over Appellant Shauna Awai's appealNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-"An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree
of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for
review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and
conditions as in other cases in the circuit court[.]"  HRS § 571-
54 (2006).  In circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may appeal
from "final judgments, orders or decrees[.]"  HRS § 641-1(a)
(1993 & Supp. 2010).  "A post-judgment order is an appealable
final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order finally determines
the post-judgment proceeding."  Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai #i 105, 111
n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 2001)  (citation omitted),
affirmed in part, and vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v.
Hall, 95 Hawai #i 318, 22 P.3d 965 (2001).  In other words, "[a]
post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-
1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further
to be accomplished."  Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai #i 153, 157, 80
P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted).  "Correlatively, an
order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." 
Id.  from the Honorable Paul T. Murakami's February 1, 2011 order
requiring Appellant Shauna Awai to file a motion for permission
to leave the jurisdiction (the February 1, 2011 order), because
the February 1, 2011 order is not an appealable final order, as
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006) requires.
The February 1, 2011 order is one of several orders
that the family court has entered during the ongoing proceedings
for adjudicating Appellee Daniel Awai's April 1, 2010 motion forNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-post-decree relief regarding child custody.  In post-judgment
proceedings where the separate judgment document rule does not
apply, and
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.
S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw.
480, 494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal
quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted).  The February 1,
2011 order did not end the proceedings for Appellee Daniel Awai's
April 1, 2010 motion for post-decree relief, and, in fact, the
family court is still holding proceedings for the final
adjudication of Daniel's April 1, 2010 motion for post-decree
relief.  Therefore, the family court has not yet entered the last
post-decree order in the series of post-decree orders that will
eventually resolve the outstanding issues and give finality and
appealability to all.  Accordingly, the February 1, 2011 order is
not an appealable final post-judgment order pursuant to HRS
§ 571-54.
Although exceptions providing jurisdiction exist under
Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine) and
the collateral order doctrine, the February 1, 2011 order does
not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay
doctrine or the collateral order doctrine.  See Ciesla v.
Reddish, 78 Hawai# i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai# iNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
requirements for appealability under the collateral order
doctrine).  Appellant Shauna Awai opposes the motion to dismiss
and argues that the February 1, 2011 order is a collateral order
because the family court has allegedly threatened that, if the
children are not present at the hearing, Appellant would be in
default and custody would be awarded to Appellee Daniel Awai. 
Nothing in the February 1, 2011 order, however, requires the
children to be at any hearing.  Therefore, the February 1, 2011
order is not an appealable order.  Absent an appealable post-
decree order, Appellant Shauna Awai's appeal is premature, and we
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appellate case. 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Daniel Awai's
June 16, 2011 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000093 for
lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and this appeal is
dismissed.
