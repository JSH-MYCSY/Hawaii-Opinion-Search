IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHONG HUNG HAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR NO. 10-1-1098)
 
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 18, 2011 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Chong Hung Han's 
(Appellant Han) April 18, 2011 motion to dismiss appellate court 
case number CAAP-11-0000095 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and (2) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over Appellant Han's appeal from the Honorable Fa
'auuga L. To' oto'o's 
January 21, 2011 judgment of conviction against Appellant Han for abuse of a household or family member in violation of HRS § 709­906 (Supp. 2010), because the January 21, 2011 judgment is not NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006).
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v.
 Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). In family court matters, "[a]n interested 
party, aggrieved by any order or decree of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the circuit court, and review shall be governed by chapter 602[.]" HRS § 571-54. The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2010). "Any party deeming oneself aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate court[.]" HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2010). "The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment." Id. Under analogous circumstances in an appeal from 
a district court judgment in a criminal case, we have held that a judgment is not final and appealable unless the sentence is final: 
Judgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence. In the
 instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay restitution. The court did
 not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount. Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from
the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005). Similarly in the instant case, it appears that the 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
sentence in the January 21, 2011 judgment is not final, because
 
the January 21, 2011 judgment, on its face, indicates that the
 court was considering, but had not finally decided, whether to
 order restitution as part of the sentence. Consequently, the
 sentence in the January 21, 2011 judgment is not final, and,
 thus, the January 21, 2011 judgment is not an appealable final
 judgment under HRS § 571-54. Absent an appealable final judgment
 in the record on appeal, we cannot exercise appellate
 jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000095. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Han's
 
April 18, 2011 motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of
 jurisdiction is granted, and Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000095 is
 dismissed without prejudice to Appellant Han asserting a timely
 appeal from an appealable final judgment in FC-CR No. 10-1-1098.
