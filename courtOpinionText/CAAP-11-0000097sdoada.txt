IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GEOFFREY WOODHALL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
 
(3P7-10-00945)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Geoffrey Woodhall (Woodhall)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order filed
 
on January 20, 2011 in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 
North and South Kona Division (District Court).1
 
After a bench trial conducted on stipulated facts,
 
Woodhall was found guilty of Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the
 Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 712-1249 (1993) (Promoting Third).
 
On appeal, Woodhall raises three points of error,
 
including that: (1) the District Court's January 20, 2011 (oral)
 
factual findings are clearly erroneous because "there was
 
insufficient evidence in the record to support that Woodhall was
 
not transporting his marijuana for the purposes of alleviating
 
his debilitating medical condition"; (2) the District Court erred

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support the
 
conviction of Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Third Degree;
 
and (3) in its Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Judgment
 
entered on March 17, 2011 (FOF/COL), the District Court erred in
 
concluding that HRS § 329-122 does not permit the medical use of
 
marijuana in any place open to the public. Although not raised
 
as a point of error, Woodhall also argues that HRS §§ 712­
1240.1(2) & 712-1249 are unconstitutionally vague with respect to
 
the "legitimate and necessary" transportation of medical
 
marijuana by qualifying medical marijuana patients.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties and
 
amicus curiae, we resolve Woodhall's points of error as follows: 
Under Hawai' i law, as set forth in HRS § 712-1249, it 
is illegal to knowingly possess marijuana: 
§ 712-1249 Promoting a detrimental drug in the third
degree.  (1) A person commits the offense of promoting a
detrimental drug in the third degree if the person knowingly
possesses any marijuana or any Schedule V substance in any
amount.
 
(2) Promoting a detrimental drug in the third degree
is a petty misdemeanor.
 
Hawai'i law permits, however, the "medical use" of 
marijuana, as set forth in HRS § 329-122 (2010), which provides 
in relevant part: 
§ 329-122 Medical use of marijuana; conditions of
use. (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the
medical use of marijuana by a qualifying patient shall be
permitted only if:
 
(1)	 The qualifying patient has been diagnosed by a
physician as having a debilitating medical
condition;
 
(2) 	The qualifying patient's physician has certified
in writing that, in the physician's professional
opinion, the potential benefits of the medical
use of marijuana would likely outweigh the
health risks for the particular qualifying
patient; and
 
(3) 	The amount of marijuana does not exceed an
adequate supply.
 
. . . . 
2
       
         
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(c) The authorization for the medical use of
 
marijuana in this section shall not apply to:
 
(1) 	The medical use of marijuana that endangers the
health or well-being of another person;
 
(2) 	The medical use of marijuana:
(A)	 In a school bus, public bus, or any moving
vehicle;
(B) 	In the workplace of one's employment;
(C) 	On any school grounds;
(D)	 At any public park, public beach, public
recreation center, recreation or youth center;
 or
 
(E)	 Other place open to the public; and
 
(3) 	The use of marijuana by a qualifying
patient, parent, or primary caregiver for
purposes other than medical use permitted
by this part. 
"Medical use" is defined in HRS § 329-121 (2010) as:
 
[T]he acquisition, possession, cultivation, use,
distribution, or transportation of marijuana or
paraphernalia relating to the administration of marijuana to
alleviate the symptoms or effects of a qualifying patient's
debilitating medical condition. For the purposes of
"medical use", the term distribution is limited to the
transfer of marijuana and paraphernalia from the primary
caregiver to the qualifying patient.
 
Woodhall's conviction was based on the following
 
stipulated facts:
 
1.	 On [] March 8, 2010 in Kona, County and State of
Hawaii[,] Geoffrey Woodhall knowingly possessed
marijuana measuring 2.12 grams at the Kona
International Airport. The marijuana was
contained in a clear plastic baggie.
2.	 The Kona International Airport is a place open
to the public.
3.	 The marijuana in Defendant's possession is
marijuana as defined pursuant to Hawaii Revised
Statute ("HRS") 329-1 and 712-1240.
4.	 Defendant possessed a valid medical marijuana
certificate, Registration No. MJ14476, on March
8, 2010. []
5.	 Defendant possessed the medical marijuana to
transport it through airport security at the
Transportation Security Administration ("TSA")
checkpoint. TSA employees discovered the
medical marijuana in his possession. Defendant
 provided his valid medial marijuana certificate
to TSA officials as well as Hawaii County Police
Department officer David T. Matsushima.
6.	 Defendant was not smoking, inhaling, or
ingesting the medical marijuana.
7.	 The Defendant has been informed that he has the
 right to have a trial. The Defendant has also
 been informed that at a trial he has the right
to confront and cross examine the witnesses who
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
testify. The Defendant hereby waives his right
to a trial in this matter and agrees to have the
question of his guilt or innocence determined by
the Court alone based upon the above facts,
exhibits and subsequent submissions of counsel.
The Defendant also waives his right to cross
examine the witnesses and agrees to submit the
above facts, attached exhibits, and submissions
of counsel without cross-examination.
 
Woodhall argues that, based on these stipulated facts,
 
"there was insufficient evidence for the court to infer that
 
Woodhall was not transporting his marijuana for the purposes of
 
alleviating his debilitating medical condition." Woodhall is not
 
entitled to relief on this ground.
 
"An affirmative defense requires the prosecution to 
prove each and every element of the charged crime beyond a 
reasonable doubt. The defendant claiming lack of penal 
responsibility has the burden of going forward with the evidence 
to prove facts constituting the defense and of proving such facts 
by a preponderance of the evidence." State v. Uyesugi, 100 
Hawai'i 442, 456, 60 P.3d 843, 857 (2002). 
Woodhall failed to carry his burden of proving, by a
 
preponderance of the evidence, his affirmative defense of medical
 use as defined in HRS § 329-121. Woodhall states that, other
 
than Stipulated Facts 3, 4, and 5, "no evidence was offered
 
regarding Woodhall's underlying purpose for transporting his
 
medical marijuana at the airport." Stipulated Facts 3, 4, and 5
 
do not specify that Woodhall was transporting marijuana to
 
alleviate symptoms or the effects of a debilitating medical
 
condition. None of the stipulated facts relate to Woodhall's
 
purpose for possessing marijuana at the Kona Airport. The
 
written certification does not create a presumption as to
 
Woodhall's purpose for possessing marijuana at the Kona Airport. 
It is merely a statement "that in the physician's professional
 
opinion, the qualifying patient has a debilitating medical
 
condition and the potential benefits of the medical use of
 
marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the
 
qualifying patient." HRS § 329-121. The District Court did not
 
4
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
clearly err in its January 20, 2011 factual findings. 
(2) Woodhall stipulated that "On [] March 8, 2010 in 
Kona, County and State of Hawaii[,] Geoffrey Woodhall knowingly 
possessed marijuana measuring 2.12 grams at the Kona 
International Airport." There was sufficient evidence to convict 
Woodhall of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree. See, 
e.g., State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 
330-31 (2007). 
(3) On January 20, 2011, the District Court orally
 
found Woodhall guilty and imposed a sentence.  On that same day,
 
the District Court filed a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or
 
Order which also stated Woodhall's sentence. The Notice of Entry
 
of Judgment and/or Order constituted a final appealable judgment. 
See Rule 32 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure. On February
 
17, 2011, Woodhall filed a Notice of Appeal which stated that he
 
appealed from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order filed
 
on January 20, 2011. 
"Judgments of conviction entered in the district courts 
may not be appealed unless they are final. Judgments of 
conviction are not final unless they include the final 
adjudication and the final sentence." State v. Kilborn, 109 
Hawai'i 435, 442, 127 P.2d 95, 102 (App. 2005). The FOF/COL was 
not an amended final judgment because, inter alia, it did not 
include a sentence. Thus, the FOF/COL is merely a post-judgment 
document filed after the final appealable judgment was entered on 
January 20, 2011. 
"The general rule is that the filing of a notice of 
appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed 
case." State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 448-49, 923 P.2d 388, 
390-91 (1996) (citation omitted). "Jurisdiction over the appealed case is transferred from the trial court to the [appellate] court 
at the time the notice of appeal is filed." TSA Int'l Ltd. v. 
Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 265, 990 P.2 713, 735 (1999) 
(citation omitted). Neither the parties nor the District Court, 
in its FOF/COL, cite any statute, rule, or other authority 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
providing for the retention of jurisdiction after the filing of
 
the Notice of Appeal in this case. Upon review, we find none.
 Although the FOF/COL was dated "Nunc Pro Tunc, January
 
20, 2011," no motion, timely or otherwise, was filed seeking to
 
amend the court's judgment; nor by its own terms did the FOF/COL
 
seek to correct an oversight or inadvertent mistake in the
 
January 20, 2011 judgment. See, e.g., Duponte v. Duponte, 53
 
Haw. 123, 126-27, 488 P.2d 537, 540 (1971). Thus, the District
 Court lacked jurisdiction to enter its FOF/COL on March 17, 2011. 
Therefore, this court cannot review and will not address points
 
of error challenging the findings and/or conclusions set forth
 
therein.
 
Woodhall's claim that HRS §§ 712-1240.1 & 712-1249 are 
unconstitutionally vague was not identified as a point of error, 
as required by Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4). Woodhall has not identified where in the record on 
appeal an objection was raised or the manner in which the alleged 
constitutional defect was brought to the attention of the trial 
court. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(ii) and (iii). There is nothing 
in the record that indicates Woodhall challenged the constitutionality of HRS §§ 712-1240.1(2) & 712-1249 in the court 
below. We decline to conclude that the District Court committed 
plain error when it failed to sua sponte declare that these 
statutory provisions are unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, 
this argument will be disregarded. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4).
