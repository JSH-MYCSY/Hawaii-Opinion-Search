probate court denied two petitions (Petitions) filed pro se by
 
Smith on October 22, 2009. On appeal, Smith appears to argue
 
that the probate court erred in denying the Petitions after he
 
provided the court with additional information to aid its review,
 
as per the court's request. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Smith's points of error as follows:
 In the Petitions, Smith appears to have claimed that
 
his brother, Lawrence Smith, Jr. (Lawrence), and/or other
 
individuals fraudulently conspired to make Lawrence the Personal
 
Representative of the estate of their mother, Mary C. Bovee, also
 
known as Mary Correa Bovee (Bovee); misrepresented the value of
 
the estate; failed to report the existence of additional estate
 
assets; and intentionally withheld Smith's distribution. 
Smith claimed that Lawrence committed "'contempt' of
 
probate court and other violations of law," and cited to Hawaii

After the death of a testator and on request of an

to a person able to secure its probate or if none is known,
deposit it with an appropriate court. A person who
knowingly and wilfully fails to so deliver or deposit a will
is liable to any person aggrieved for any damages that may
be sustained by the failure, and the court may award treble

§560:3-1005 Limitations on proceedings against
personal representative.  Unless previously barred by
adjudication and except as provided in the closing
statement, the rights of successors and of creditors whose
claims have not otherwise been barred against the personal
representative for breach of fiduciary duty are barred

The
 
rights thus barred do not include rights to recover from a
personal representative for fraud, misrepresentation, or
inadequate disclosure related to the settlement of the
decedent's estate.
5 HRS § 560:3-1006 (2006 Repl.) provides in relevant part:
 
§560:3-1006 Limitations on actions and proceedings
against distributees.  Unless previously adjudicated in a
formal testacy proceeding or in a proceeding settling the
accounts of a personal representative or otherwise barred,
the claim of a claimant to recover from a distributee who is
 liable to pay the claim, and the right of an heir or devisee
. . . to recover property improperly distributed or its
value from any distributee is forever barred at the later of
three years after the decedent's death or one year after the
time of its distribution thereof . . . . This section does
 not bar an action to recover property or value received as a
result of fraud.
6 HRS § 560:3-1201 (2006 Repl.) provides in relevant part:
 
§560:3-1201 Collection of personal property by

him, without establishing the authority or evidence supporting
 
such claims. 
Smith filed the Petitions more than twenty years after 
the probate court filed its July 17, 1989 Order Approving Final 
Accounts and Distributing and Settling Estate. We conclude that 
Smith's appeal lacks merit and the probate court did not err in 
denying the Petitions. To the extent the Petitions could be 
construed as having been brought pursuant to Hawai' i Probate 
Rules (HPR) Rule 36(b), they would be untimely. See HPR Rule 
36(b). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
March 9, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is
 affirmed.
