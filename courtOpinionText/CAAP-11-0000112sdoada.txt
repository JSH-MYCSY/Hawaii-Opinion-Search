APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bruce Chadwick (Chadwick) appeals
 
pro se from the Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
 
and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and
 
Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint filed
 
October 9, 2009 (Judgment), filed on February 22, 2011, in the
 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).1

Chadwick raises four points of error on appeal,  which
state as follows:
 
1
 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided.
 
2
 Chadwick's points of error fail to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). His points of error contain none of
the required citations to the record. To the extent possible, we have,
nevertheless, reviewed the merits of Chadwick's appeal. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. The court below erred in tacitly deciding that
it acquired jurisdiction to adjudicate Appellant as a
contract law violator contrary to HRS §656 and Rule 17 Id.,
notwithstanding the fact that governments provide defendants
an affirmative defense against a plaintiff missing its
ratification.
 
B. On November 8, 2010, pursuant to Rule 17 Id.,
 
Appellant timely initiated government's affirmative defense
and moved for relief from Appellee's faulty suit (CC Doc
15), which court failed to adjudge. The Appellant prayed,
to no avail, that the lower court's error be corrected.
C. The lower court denied the requested relief
without written decision(s). The lower court's conclusion
 
appears erroneous because the provisions of, inter alia, HRS
 Chapter 656 and Rule 17 Id. do not permit the lower court to
proceed with any inappropriate action without first
witnessing the ratification, e.g. holding the contract
effected between the parties.
D. The lower court's points of error in departing
from its duties caused unconstitutional acts, which
Appellant requests, in the interest of justice, that this
Honorable Court notice all other related errors of record
 not presented in this brief.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Chadwick's points of error as follows:
 
(A, B & C) Chadwick's contention that the Circuit
 
Court lacked jurisdiction over this matter is without merit. It
 
appears that Chadwick contends that Plaintiff-Appellee E*Trade
 
Bank (E*Trade) lacked standing to bring this foreclosure action
 
and, therefore, the Circuit Court erred when it failed to dismiss
 
the complaint. We disagree. The complaint alleged that Chadwick
 
(and Defendant Bonnie Sue Chadwick) defaulted on payments due
 
pursuant to a transferrable promissory note, which note was
 
secured by a mortgage. The complaint further alleged that
 
E*Trade possessed and owned the note, and was the assignee under
 
a duly-recorded assignment of said mortgage. Thus, E*Trade
 
alleged a sufficient stake in the matter to confer standing upon
 
it to bring the foreclosure complaint. See, e.g., Hawaii's
 
Thousand Friends v. Anderson, 70 Haw. 276, 281, 768 P.2d 1293,
 1298 (1989).
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(D) It appears that Chadwick's argument that the 
Circuit Court's actions were unconstitutional is raised for the 
first time on appeal. Chadwick appears to argue that the Circuit 
Court failed to comply with Circuit Court Rule 24 and 
"overlooked" E*Trade's alleged failure to timely file its 
pretrial statement, thereby purportedly depriving him of his due 
process rights under the United States Constitution and the 
Hawai'i Constitution. Chadwick fails to provide any factual or 
legal support for his assertions. Moreover, the rule in this jurisdiction prohibits an appellant from complaining for the 
first time on appeal of error to which he has acquiesced or to 
which he failed to object. Okuhara v. Broida, 51 Haw. 253, 255, 
456 P.2d 228, 230 (1969) (citations omitted); see also HRS § 641-2 (Supp. 2010) ("The appellate court . . . need not 
consider a point that was not presented in the trial court in an 
appropriate manner."); Craft v. Peebles, 78 Hawai‘i 287, 294, 893 
P.2d 138, 145 (1995); HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). 
Chadwick otherwise fails to raise any discernible 
argument on this appeal. We have recognized that "[a]n appellate 
court need not address matters as to which the appellant has 
failed to present a discernible argument." International Sav. 
and Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai' i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 
454, 463 (App. 2000); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (stating that the 
argument in the opening brief must contain "citations to the 
authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on" and 
"[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived"); Ala Moana Boat 
Owners' Ass'n v. State, 50 Haw. 156, 158, 434 P.2d 516, 518 
(1967); Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 
433, 16 P.3d 827, 838 (2000) ("An appellate court does not have to address matters for which the appellant has failed to present 
discernible argument.").
