NAKAMURA, C.J., FOLEY and GINOZA, JJ.
 
ORDER DENYING CLAIMANTS-APPELLEES'
 
MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
Claimants-Appellees the Trustees of the Don Ho
 
Revocable Living Trust (Appellee Trustees) filed a Motion to
 
Dismiss For Lack of Jurisdiction (Motion to Dismiss) seeking
 dismissal of this appeal on grounds that Respondents-Appellants
 Dorianne Demattos, aka Dorianne Ho, Elizabeth Guevara, and
 Donalei Ho (collectively Appellants) failed to timely appeal. 
Appellants, who are proceeding pro se, did not file an opposition
 to the Motion to Dismiss.
   
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellee Trustees contend that an order confirming an
 
arbitration award also constitutes entry of final judgment, and
 
that Appellants were therefore required to file an appeal within
 thirty days from the confirmation order. Because Appellants did
 not file their appeal in that time period, Appellee Trustees
 contend the appeal was untimely and this court lacks
 jurisdiction.
 
Under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 658,
 
Appellee Trustees would be correct. However, because HRS Chapter
 658 was repealed and replaced by HRS Chapter 658A, we apply the
 statutory authority applicable to appeals under HRS Chapter
 658A.
1 In this case, Appellants filed a notice of appeal that
 
was not timely with respect to the confirmation order, but which
 was timely with respect to a final judgment filed subsequent to
 the confirmation order. As explained below, under HRS § 658A-28
 (Supp. 2010) and § 658A-25 (Supp. 2010), we hold that Appellants
 were authorized to appeal from the final judgment in this case.
I. Procedural History
 
On November 12, 2010, Appellee Trustees initiated the
 
proceedings in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 
2
Court)  by filing a motion to confirm an arbitration award
(motion to confirm). Appellee Trustees asserted that an
 arbitration proceeding had been held pursuant to the terms of a
 settlement agreement and that an arbitration award had been
 issued in their favor on October 22, 2010. Appellee Trustees
 requested that the Circuit Court confirm the arbitration award,
 enter final judgment, and enter a writ of possession related to
 certain real property that was a subject of the arbitration
 award.

 In 2001, by way of Act 265, the Hawai' i Legislature adopted HRS
Chapter 658A and repealed HRS Chapter 658. See 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265. 
Act 265 took effect on July 1, 2002. Under HRS § 658A-3(c)(Supp. 2010),
"[a]fter June 30, 2004, this chapter governs an agreement to arbitratewhenever made."

 The Honorable Robert M. Browning presided.

On December 7, 2010, Appellants filed a motion to
 
vacate the arbitration award (motion to vacate).
 
On January 14, 2011, after having held a consolidated
 
hearing on the motions, the Circuit Court issued an order
 
granting Appellee Trustees' motion to confirm and denying
 Appellants' motion to vacate (January 14, 2011 order).
 
On January 27, 2011, pursuant to the order confirming
 
the arbitration award, the Circuit Court entered final judgment
 in favor of the Appellee Trustees and against the Appellants. On
 the same date, the Circuit Court entered a writ of possession in
 favor of Appellee Trustees related to the real property at issue.
 
On February 28, 2011, Appellants filed a notice of
 
appeal from the final judgment.
II. Discussion
 
A. Current Provisions Under HRS Chapter 658A
 
In cases involving arbitration awards, an appeal to the
 
appellate courts is authorized as set forth under HRS § 658A-28.

This statute provides in full:
 
§ 658A-28. Appeals.  (a) An appeal may be taken from:
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration;
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration;
(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an
award;
(4) An order modifying or correcting an award;
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this
chapter.
(b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as
from an order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
In turn, HRS § 658A-25 addresses entry of final
 
judgment as follows:
 
§ 658A-25. Judgment on award; attorney's fees and
litigation expenses. (a) Upon granting an order confirming,
vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or
correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment in
conformity therewith. The judgment may be recorded,

 "HRS Chapter 658A is based on the Uniform Arbitration Act (2000)
(RUAA), which was approved by the National Conference of Commissioners onUniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 2000." Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 
122 Hawai' i 393, 395, 227 P.3d 559, 561 (App. 2010) (brackets and citation
omitted).

docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a civil
action.
 
. . . .
 
HRS § 658A-28 and § 658A-25 must be considered in
 
conjunction with each other in this case. HRS § 658A-28 lists
 
the types of orders and judgments from which an appeal may be
 taken. HRS § 658A-25, in turn, does not provide for entry of
 judgment in all circumstances involving an arbitration award, but
 does apply inter alia where a court has granted an order
 confirming an arbitration award.
 
Rule 4(a) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP), requires that "[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a) (2011). Appellants did not appeal from the January 14, 2011 order granting confirmation. Moreover, their February 28, 2011 notice of appeal would be untimely with respect to that order because it was filed more than thirty days after January 14, 2011. The key question is thus whether Appellants were authorized under HRS § 658A-28(a)(6) to appeal from the January 27, 2011 final judgment. 
Given the express language and plain meaning of 
HRS § 658A-28 and § 658A-25, we conclude that Appellants were authorized to appeal from either the January 14, 2011 order granting confirmation
4 or the January 27, 2011 final judgment.5 
HRS § 658A–28(a) authorizes an appeal from an order confirming an award or from a final judgment entered pursuant to that chapter. Cf., In re United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 124 Hawai'i 372, 376 n.2, 244 P.3d 609, 613 n.2 (App. 2010) 
(HRS § 658A–28(a) "provides appeals from orders denying a motion to compel arbitration or from final judgments entered pursuant to that chapter. The order need not satisfy both criteria to be appealable.").

It is important to note that, as required by
 
HRS § 658A-28(a)(6), the final judgment in this case was "entered 
pursuant to this chapter" because it meets the requirements of HRS § 658A-25. That is, the final judgment was entered pursuant to an order granting confirmation of the arbitration award, one of the specified types of orders pursuant to which judgment is to be entered under HRS § 658A-25. HRS § 658A-25 provides for entry of judgment only upon "granting an order confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award[.]" The legislature has thus specified the types of orders for which entry of judgment is appropriate. These types of orders bring finality to arbitration matters. Cf., SHOPO v. 
County of Kauai, 123 Hawai' i 128, 132, 230 P.3d 428, 432 (App. 
2010) ("[T]he statutory structure providing for appeals from arbitration-related orders, when read as a whole, is designed to permit appeals only from orders that bring an element of finality to the arbitration process.") (quoting Karcher Firestopping v. Meadow Valley Contractors, Inc., 204 P.3d 1262, 1265-66 (Nev. 2009)). 
Given the circumstances of this case, a direct appeal 
was authorized under HRS § 658A-28(a)(3) or HRS § 658A-28(a)(6). This process remains consistent with the legislature's intent that arbitration matters be resolved expeditiously and inexpensively. Cf., Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., 77 
Hawai'i 88, 92, 881 P.2d 1234, 1238 (1994).

 In Oppenheimer, the Hawai' i Supreme Court recognized that by allowing
direct appeals from certain orders pertaining to arbitration awards, the
legislature had "carv[ed] out a specific exception to HRS § 641-1(a)" that was"wholly consistent with its intent that matters subject to arbitration beexpeditiously and inexpensively resolved." 77 Hawai' i at 92, 881 P.2d at
1238. As explained infra, Oppenheimer considered provisions in HRS Chapter658, the predecessor chapter to HRS Chapter 658A. However, the currentprovisions under HRS Chapter 658A –- HRS § 658A-28 and § 658A-25 -- alsoauthorize a process for immediate appeals, albeit somewhat different, thatallows arbitration matters to be resolved expeditiously and inexpensively.

Appellants were therefore authorized to file an appeal
 
from the January 27, 2011 final judgment and their notice of
 
appeal was timely under HRAP Rule 4(a).7
 
B. Predecessor Statutes Under HRS Chapter 658
 
In seeking dismissal, Appellee Trustees rely on case
 
law which interpreted and applied the statutory provisions
 previously set out under the now repealed HRS Chapter 658. For
 purposes of this case, there are material differences between the
 repealed provisions and the provisions now applicable under
 HRS Chapter 658A.
 
Under the prior chapter, the authority to appeal was
 
set out in HRS § 658-15 (1993 Repl.), which stated:
 
§658-15 Appeal when.  Unless the agreement for award
provides that no appeal may be taken an appeal may be taken
from an order vacating an award, or from a judgment entered
upon an award, as from an order or judgment in an action,
otherwise no appeal may be had.
 
In turn, the entry of judgment was determined by HRS § 658-12
 
(1993 Repl.), which specified:
 
§658-12 Entry of judgment . Upon the granting of an
order, confirming, modifying, or correcting an award, the
same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the
 circuit court and this shall constitute the entry of
judgment. An appeal may be taken from such judgment as
hereinafter set forth. 
Under these earlier provisions, when a circuit court 
issued an order "confirming, modifying, or correcting an award," 
that order constituted "entry of judgment" under HRS § 658-12. Therefore, the time to appeal commenced from the issuance of those types of orders, and not from any subsequently entered judgment. Oppenheimer, 77 Hawai' i at 91-92, 881 P.2d at 1237-38 
("by virtue of HRS § 658-12, an order confirming an arbitration award is a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken") (footnote omitted); Kalawaia v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., 90 Hawai' i 
167, 171, 977 P.2d 175, 179 (1999); Dilsaver v. Assoc. of 
7
 Appellants' notice of appeal filed February 28, 2011 was timely
because thirty days from January 27, 2011 was Saturday, February 26, 2011.
Under HRAP Rule 26(a), because the thirtieth day was a Saturday, the period to
appeal was extended until the following Monday, February 28, 2011.

Apartment Owners of Kona Coffee Villas, 92 Hawai' i 206, 208-09, 
990 P.2d 104, 106-07 (1999). 
Indeed, under the now repealed statutes, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court had ruled that a document entitled "judgment" which 
was filed after a written order granting confirmation of an arbitration award was "surplusage." Kalawaia, 90 Hawai' i at 171, 
977 P.2d at 179; Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai' i 505, 510 n.3, 993 
P.2d 539, 544 n.3 (2000). The supreme court thus directed that "[b]ecause of the special circumstances surrounding the confirmation of an award arising out of arbitration proceedings, and to avoid confusion in the future, the circuit court should refrain from entering a 'judgment' on a separate document from the order confirming the arbitration award." Kalawaia, 90 
Hawai'i at 171, 977 P.2d at 179. 
HRS Chapter 658 was repealed, effective as of July 1,
 
2002. Therefore, the cases applying the provisions in that
 chapter are inapposite to this case. With the provisions now
 applicable under HRS Chapter 658A, a separate judgment must be
 entered pursuant to certain specified types of orders (i.e., an
 order which confirms, vacates without directing a rehearing,
 modifies, or corrects an award), and an appeal from such a
 judgment is one of the options authorized.
III. Conclusion
 
Appellants' February 28, 2011 notice of appeal was
 
timely filed with respect to the January 27, 2011 final judgment. 
We therefore deny the Appellee Trustees' Motion to Dismiss and
 conclude we have jurisdiction in this appeal.
