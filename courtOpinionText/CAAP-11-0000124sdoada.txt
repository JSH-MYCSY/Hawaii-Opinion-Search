IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE ARBITRATION BETWEEN

TRUSTEES OF THE DON HO REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST,
Claimants-Appellees, v. DORIANNE HO, ELIZABETH
GUEVARA and DONALEI HO, Respondents-Appellants

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(S.P. NO. 10-1-0345)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Dorianne L. DeMattos (a.k.a.

Dorianne L. Ho) (DeMattos) appeals pro se from a January 27, 2011

Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit

1
(Circuit Court).  Respondents-Appellants Elizabeth Guevara

(
Guevara) and Donalei Ho (Ho) filed pro se a "Joint Notice of

Appeal" with DeMattos, but failed to file briefs or otherwise

prosecute their appeals herein.

DeMattos's brief fails in numerous and substantial ways 
to comply with Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4), but nevertheless enumerates four points of error, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) reforming the 
trust; (2) enforcing the settlement agreement; (3) enforcing the

arbitration clause in the settlement agreement; and (4) approving

the arbitration award and entering final judgment in this matter.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve

DeMattos's points of error as follows:

DeMattos's first three points of error fail to identify

any orders in the proceedings below that could be construed to

reform a trust, order the enforcement of a settlement agreement,

or enforce an arbitration clause in a settlement agreement. It

appears that these issues were the subject of a related, but

separate, Probate Court proceeding. DeMattos fails to present
 
any cogent factual or legal argument in support of any relief

related to these points of error. We therefore conclude that

these points of error are without merit.

DeMattos's fourth point of error appears to challenge

the Circuit Court's January 14, 2011 order that, inter alia,

granted Claimants-Appellees the Trustees of the Don Ho Revocable

Living Trust's (Trustees) motion to confirm the subject

arbitration award and denied DeMattos, Ho, and Guevara's motion

to vacate the arbitration award. DeMattos's failure to provide

an adequate record, in particular her failure to include a

transcript of the December 27, 2010 hearing on the Trustees'

motion to confirm and the respondents' motion to vacate, and her

other failures to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) hamper our

review of DeMattos's assertion of error. See Union Bldg.
 
Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151-52, 682

P.2d 82, 87 (1984). In addition, DeMattos has failed to
 
establish and the record does not demonstrate that the Circuit

Court plainly erred when it rejected the respondents' arguments

that the arbitration award should be vacated based on one of six

alternative grounds stated in Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 658A-23

(Supp. 2012) and instead granted the Trustees' motion to confirm.

For these reasons, the Circuit Court's January 27, 2011

Final Judgment is affirmed.
