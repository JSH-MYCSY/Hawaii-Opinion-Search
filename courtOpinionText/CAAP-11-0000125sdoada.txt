the November 22, 2010 "Order Denying Motion For Relief Related To
 
Child Support Filed by [Father] on March 20, 2010 and Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part [Mother's] Motion for Relief
 
After Judgment Or Order Filed May 6, 2010" (2010 Trial Order) and
 
the February 2, 2011 "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration
 
Filed December 2, 2010."
 
On appeal, Mother contends:
 (1) 2010 Trial Order statement #5 erroneously finds the
 
family court adjudicated paternity at a hearing held July 23,
 2009 (2009 Hearing);
 
(2) 2010 Trial Order statement #7 finds Father's child
 
support obligations commenced after the 2009 Hearing adjudication
 
of paternity;
 
(3) though phrased as a factual finding, 2010 Trial
 
Order statement #9 is an erroneous conclusion of law that
 
mistakenly attributes the award of child support on the
 
determination of "sole physical custody"; and
 
(4) 2010 Trial Order statement #9 erroneously finds
 
father voluntarily contributed to the financial support of the
 
children though the record provides no support for such a
 
finding.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Mother's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal under the
"clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is clearly erroneous
when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support
the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support
of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with
a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.
 "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence which is of

sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court's COLs are reviewed on
appeal de novo, under the right/wrong standard. COLs,
consequently, are "not binding upon an appellate court and
are freely reviewable for their correctness."
 
.  .  .  .
 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway in its
examination of the reports concerning a child's care,
custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in this regard, if
supported by the record and not clearly erroneous, must
stand on appeal.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) 
(internal citations, internal quotation marks, brackets, and 
ellipsis points omitted). 
(1) The 2010 Trial Order statement #5 states, "[o]n
 
July 23, 2009, the Family Court adjudicated paternity and awarded
 
the parties joint legal and physical custody of their two minor
 
children." Mother contends statement #5 is incorrect because
 
paternity was not a disputed issue before the court. Father
 
acknowledges that he signed a Voluntary Establishment of
 
Paternity form (Acknowledgment) and does not dispute paternity
 
for the Children.
 
Under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 584-3.5(a) (2006
 
Repl.), a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity signed under oath
 
at the hospital establishes paternity for unwed parents. Once
 
paternity is established by an executed Acknowledgment, no
 
further judicial or administrative proceeding is "required or
 
permitted to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment of paternity" 
HRS § 584-3.5(h). 
Neither Mother nor Father raised the issue of paternity
 
before the court at the 2009 Hearing. Though the December 28,
 
2009 "Order Re: Custody Visitation And Support Orders After
 
Voluntary Acknowledgment Of Paternity" issued pursuant to the
 
2009 Hearing lists paternity as an adjudicated issue, paternity
 
was not before the court and the 2009 Hearing did not establish
 
paternity. The family court erred on 2010 Trial Order statement
 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
#5, stating paternity was adjudicated. However, as will be seen
 
in the discussion of issue (2) below, this error was harmless in
 
that it did not prejudice Mother as to the family court's ruling
 
on back child support.
 
(2) Mother contends the family court erred by
 
incorrectly stating the law in 2010 Trial Order statement #7. 
2010 Trial Order statement #7 states as follows: "Father's child
 
support obligations commenced upon the establishment of paternity
 
for [the Children] in FC-P No. 08-1-0787 [at the 2009 Hearing]
 
and the [family court] is precluded from awarding back child
 
support prior to the establishment of paternity."
 
Under Hawai' i law, the family court may exercise its 
discretion in awarding back child support prior to the entry of a 
judgment or order. According to HRS § 584-15(c) (2006 Repl.), 
"[t]he court may further order the noncustodial parent to 
reimburse the custodial parent . . . for reasonable expenses 
incurred prior to the entry of judgment, including support[.]" 
HRS § 584-15(c). The family court erred in stating the court was 
unable to award child support prior to an adjudication of 
paternity. In Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Roe, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai' i affirmed an award of back child support 
and concluded that father was not prejudiced by a request for back child support from birth where father had ample notice that 
such support was at issue before the court. Child Support 
Enforcement Agency v. Roe, 96 Hawai' i 1, 11-12, 25 P.3d 60, 71-72 
(2001). See also, Doe v. Roe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 570, 705 P.2d 
535, 545 (1985) ("Appellee became entitled to, and Appellant responsible for, current support for the child and reimbursement 
for past child support.") This error of the family court, 
however, was harmless. Despite this erroneous statement of the 
law in statement #7, the family court ultimately applied the 
proper standard in deciding back child support. 
(3) Mother contends the family court erred in
 
concluding "sole physical custody" could not be determined and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
thus, prevented an award of back child support. The April 5,
 
2011 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law (2011 FOF/COL) #9
 
states:
 
Neither party has shown that they had sole physical custody
of the [Children] for any significant period that was not
covered by the above orders. Based on the Credibility or
lack of credibility of the parties and the witnesses that
testified at this hearing the Court is unable to make a
determination that either parent had sole physical Custody
of [the Children] during the contested periods. It is clear
 from the record that both parents have played an active role
in [the Children's] lives and neither has shown that they
did not share joint physical custody of the children. It is
 also clear from the record that Father had been giving
financial support to Mother throughout the [Children's]
lives without an Order from the Court. The Court will not
 make a determination of back support for the periods not
covered by the above orders.
 
Mother argues the family court erred in withholding 
back child support after finding that parents shared joint 
custody. The 2004 Hawai' i Child Support Guidelines (2004 
Guidelines) provides guidance to the family court for awarding support in joint custody circumstances. The family court, 
however, may exercise discretion in awarding back child support. 
Under HRS § 584-15(c), "[t]he court may further order the 
noncustodial parent" to pay back child support. HRS § 584-15(c). 
Mother's argument that the 2004 Guidelines require the family 
court to award back support based on joint custody calculations 
misinterprets Hawai' i law governing the use of the 2004 
Guidelines. HRS § 584-15(e) states that the court "shall use the guidelines" to determine the amount of support for "the period 
during which the duty of support is owed." HRS § 584-15(e). The 
family court was not obligated to use the 2004 Guidelines for any 
time periods where the family court did not establish a duty of 
support. 
The family court did not err in considering prior
 
custody and support. HRS § 584-15(c) states, "[t]he court may
 
further order the noncustodial parent" to pay back child support. 
HRS § 584-15(c). The family court found both parents shared
 
custody and that Father continuously financially supported the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Children, and as such, Father did not owe back child support for
 
the contested periods.
 Hawai'i law grants the family court discretion to 
determine what amount, if any, may be awarded as back child 
support. HRS § 584-15(d) states, "[t]he court may limit the 
father's liability for past support of the child to the 
proportion of the expenses already incurred that the court deems 
just." HRS § 584-15(d). See also, State, Child Support 
Enforcement Agency v. Doe, 98 Hawai' i 58, 65, 41 P.3d 720, 727 
(Haw. App. 2001). The family court did not abuse its discretion 
in 2011 FOF/COL #9. 
Mother contends the family court clearly erred in
 
finding both parents shared joint custody of the Children during
 
the contested periods. 2011 FOF/COL #9 states the family court
 
weighed the credibility of the witnesses and determined both
 
Mother and Father shared joint custody of the Children during the
 
contested periods.
 
Mother cited to testimony supporting claims the
 
Children were in her care during the contested periods. Father
 
produced evidence to support the claim the Children were in his
 
care or with his parents during the contested periods. At trial,
 
the family court heard testimony from witnesses attesting to
 
Father's care of the Children. Although Mother produced evidence
 
to support her claim the Children were in her care, a family
 
court determination of past custody stands when it is based on
 
the record and not clearly erroneous, as the case here. Fisher,
 
at 46, 137 P.3d at 360.
 
(4) Mother's contention that 2010 FOF/COL #9 is clearly
 
erroneous was not argued and is therefore waived. HRAP Rule
 28(b)(7).

 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 22, 2010 "Order
