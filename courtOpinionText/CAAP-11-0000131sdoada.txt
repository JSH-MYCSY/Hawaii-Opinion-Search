 Presiding Judge, Reifurth and (By: Fujise,  Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Raymond P. Tasini, also known as

Raymond P. Tasani, (Tasini)  appeals from the Judgment Conviction

 HRS § 707-711 provides in relevant part:

On appeal, Tasini raises one point of error, that the
 
deputy prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct by
 
misstating the law in the rebuttal portion of his closing
 argument. In his rebuttal closing argument, the deputy
 prosecutor remarked that for Assault 2 "you need a laceration or
 a puncture of the skin," whereas the definition of "substantial
 bodily injury" requires, inter alia, a "major" laceration or a
 penetration of the skin, pursuant to HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2006).

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tasini's point of error as follows:
 
In his rebuttal closing argument, the deputy prosecutor 
mis-characterized the injury involved in an Assault 2 by omitting the term "major" from the phrase "major . . . laceration or penetration of the skin." See HRS § 707-700. The defense did 
not object at trial and we conclude that the omission was not plain error. In determining whether the alleged misconduct constituted plain error that affected Tasini's substantial rights, we consider "the nature of the alleged misconduct, the promptness or lack of a curative instruction, and the strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant." State v. Iuli, 
101 Hawai' i 196, 208, 65 P.3d 143, 155 (2003). 
3(...continued)
(b)	 The person recklessly causes serious or substantial
bodily injury to another person[.]
4
 HRS § 707-700 provides in relevant part:
 
"Substantial bodily injury" means bodily injury which
causes:
 
(1)	 A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the skin;
(2)	 A burn of at least second degree severity;
(3)	 A bone fracture;
(4)	 A serious concussion; or
(5)	 A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the esophagus,
viscera, or other internal organs.

First, in the context of the prosecution's closing 
argument, the nature of the alleged misconduct was not egregious 
where the deputy prosecutor only once, briefly and indirectly, referred to the injury for an Assault 2 in the larger context of seeking to explain included offenses. Second, although the circuit court did not sua sponte provide a curative instruction, the court provided the jury with the proper definition of "substantial bodily injury" in its jury instructions and also instructed the jury that "[t]he court will instruct you now concerning the law which you must follow in arriving at your verdict." See State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 405, 415, 16 P.3d 246, 
256 (2001) (stating that the jury is presumed to follow the court's instructions); State v. Kupihea, 80 Hawai' i 307, 317-18, 
909 P.2d 1122, 1132-33 (1996). Finally, strong evidence existed that the complainant suffered a major laceration or penetration of the skin. See State v. Webster, 94 Hawai' i 241, 245-46, 11 
P.3d 466, 470-71 (2000) (interpreting "major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the skin"). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment Conviction and
 
Sentence, filed on February 10, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the
 Second Circuit is affirmed.
