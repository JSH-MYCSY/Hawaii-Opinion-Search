IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE TRUST ESTATE OF
 
DON HO, also known as DONALD TAI LOY HO
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(TRUST NO. 08-1-0013)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Dondi Ho-Costa (Ho-Costa) appeals
 
pro se1 from a February 7, 2011 order granting Petitioners-
Appellees the Trustees of the Don Ho Revocable Living Trust's
 
(Trustees) June 28, 2010 Petition to Compel Arbitration and
 
Appointment of Arbitrator (Order Compelling Arbitration) entered
 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Probate Division

(Probate Court).  Respondents-Appellants Dorianne Ho (a.k.a.
 
Dorianne L. DeMattos) (DeMattos), Elizabeth Guevara (Guevara),
 
and Donalei Ho (Ho) also filed pro se a "Joint Notice of Appeal",

 Although Ho-Costa was represented by counsel when the Notice of
Appeal was filed, counsel withdrew from representation on August 17, 2011,
prior to the briefing of this case.

but did not file briefs or otherwise prosecute their appeals
 
herein.3
 
Instead of an opening brief, Ho-Costa filed a document 
entitled "Declaration of Dondi Ho-Costa to the Honorable Court of 
Appeals" (Declaration). Ho-Costa's Declaration fails to identify 
any points of error and otherwise fails in numerous and 
substantial ways to comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). It appears, however, from our review of the Declaration, and all of the records and files herein and in 
the proceedings below, that Ho-Costa is aggrieved by and seeks 
relief from the Probate Court's order enforcing an arbitration 
provision that was set forth in a settlement agreement entered 
into by Ho-Costa. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve HoÂ­
Costa's points of error as follows:
 
Ho-Costa's failure to identify points of error, record
 
references, and/or evidence or cogent legal arguments in support
 
of any relief from the Probate Court's Order Compelling
 
Arbitration severely hampers our review of this case. 
Nevertheless, it appears indisputable that the settlement
 
agreement entered into by Ho-Costa contains an arbitration
 
agreement and that the subject matter of this dispute falls
 
within the scope of the arbitration agreement. See Koolau
 
Radiology, Inc. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 445, 834 P.2d
 1294, 1300 (1992) ("[W]hen presented with a motion to compel
 
arbitration, the court is limited to answering two questions: 1)
 
whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties; and
 
2) if so, whether the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable

 It appears that the same (or an identical) Joint Notice of Appeal
was filed in CAAP-11-0000142 and will be addressed therein.

under such agreement."). Even if all or part of the settlement 
agreement itself was unenforceable, the parties' agreement to 
arbitrate may be enforced. Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 1, 4, 911 
P.2d 721, 724 (1996) ("[A]rbitration clauses are separable from 
the contracts in which they are embedded, and where no claim is 
made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself, a 
broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of 
the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.") 
(citation omitted). 
Accordingly, we affirm the Probate Court's February 7,
 
2011 Order Compelling Arbitration.
