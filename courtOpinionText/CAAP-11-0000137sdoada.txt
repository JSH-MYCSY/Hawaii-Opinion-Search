SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Cynthia J. Marcus (Marcus) appeals
 
from the April 11, 2011 "Judgment on Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against all Defendants 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
on Complaint filed May 26, 2009" (Judgment) of the Circuit Court
 
1
of the Third Circuit  (circuit court) and entered pursuant to the
"Order Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment filed on
 
December 23, 2010" and the "Order Denying Defendant Cynthia J.
 
Marcus' Motion for Reconsideration dated December 23, 2010 and
 
filed at the Court on February 7, 2011." 
Judgment was entered in
 
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Kondaur Capital Corporation (Kondaur)
 and against Marcus and Defendant-Appellee Pualani Estates at Kona
 
Community Association (Pualani).
 
On May 26, 2009, Kondaur filed a Complaint for
 
foreclosure against Marcus and Pualani. Marcus and Pualani did
 
not file answers. 
On July 12, 2010, Kondaur filed "Plaintiffs
 
Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against all
 Defendants on Complaint filed May 26, 2009" against Marcus and
 
Pualani, which the circuit court granted December 23, 2010.
 
On April 11, 2011, the circuit court entered the
 
"Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of
 
Foreclosure Against all Defendants on Complaint filed May 26,
 
2009." Marcus filed a timely appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Marcus's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
The standard of review on appeal for a denial of a 
motion to set aside default is whether there has been an abuse of 
discretion. Cnty. of Hawai' i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai' i 
391, 423, 235 P.3d 1103, 1135 (2010) (citing Hupp v. Accessory Distrib., Inc., 1 Haw. App. 174, 177, 616 P.2d 233, 235 (1980)

 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(holding that "application under Rule 55(c) Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure to set aside entry of default is addressed to the 
sound discretion of the court")); see also Gonsalves v. Nissan 
Motor Corp., 100 Hawai' i 149, 158 58 P.3d 1196, 1205 (2002). 
In BDM, Inc., v. Sageco, Inc., the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court held that a party seeking to set aside a default must 
demonstrate the following three factors: 
[i]n general, a motion to set aside a default entry or
a default judgment may and should be granted whenever the
court finds (1) that the nondefaulting party will not be
prejudiced by the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party
has a meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not
the result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.
 
BDM, Inc., v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150
 
(1976).
 
The circuit court found that based on BDM, "[Kondaur]
 
would be prejudiced by the reopening, that [Marcus did] not have
 
a meritorious defense, and that the default was a result of
 
inexcusable neglect or willful act."
 
Kondaur engaged in time consuming and exhaustive
 
attempts at effectuating personal service upon Marcus. Marcus,
 
however, engaged in conduct to defeat the foreclosure action. 
She evaded service, wrote a complaint letter to the Federal
 
Bureau of Investigation, hired and discharged various counsel,
 
and requested continuances. Marcus also made various admissions
 
that she defaulted on her Note and Mortgage, which demonstrated
 
no meritorious defense. As a result, the default was due to her
 
deliberate efforts to avoid service and delay the foreclosure
 
process.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the April 11, 2011 "Judgment
 
on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against all Defendants on Complaint filed May 26, 2009" entered
