IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
HENRY MOKIAU, also known as Henry Mokiao,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 10-1-1961)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Henry Mokiau also known as Henry
 
Mokiao (Mokiau) appeals from the Final Judgment and Sentence of
 
the Court, entered on February 10, 2011, in the Family Court of
 
the First Circuit (family court).1
 
Mokiau was found guilty of Harassment, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2011).
 
On appeal, Mokiau contends (1) the family court erred
 
by denying his motion to dismiss the charge for lack of
 
jurisdiction because the charge failed to provide sufficient
 
notice of the charge and (2) there was insufficient evidence to
 
convict him of Harassment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we

               NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
resolve Mokiau's points of error as follows:
 
The charge against Mokiau was pleaded in the
 
disjunctive which did not sufficiently apprise Mokiau of what he
 
must be prepared to meet. See State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279,
 
283 n.4, 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 n.4 (1977). The State contends that
 charging Mokiau in the disjunctive was permissible because the
 
terms strike, shove, kick, and otherwise touching are all forms
 
of contact and that the terms "offensive physical contact" is
 
inclusive of "offensive touching." [AB at 4]
 
HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) states:
 
§711-1106 Harassment.  (1) A person commits the
offense of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or
alarm any other person, that person:
 
(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or subjects the other
person to offensive physical contact[.]
 
In State v. Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai' i 290, 22 P.3d 86 
(App. 2001), the defendant claimed that knocking off a person's
 
hat did not constitute "touching another person in an offensive
 manner or subjecting the other person to offensive physical
 contact." 95 Hawai' i at 294, 22 P.3d at 90 (alterations 
omitted). In Pesentheiner, this court stated:
 
The statute thus expressly proscribes contact with an
individual's person by way of a "[s]trike[], shove[],
kick[]," or other method of "touch[ing][.]" However, HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a) also prohibits, in the disjunctive and
alternatively, acts which "subject[] [another] person to
offensive physical contact[.]"
 
On appeal, the State contends that Pesentheiner's
conduct falls within the first of these prohibitions. We
question this parsing of the statute. On its face, HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a) strains to support a construction that
defines the phrase "[s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise
touches another person" as anything less than actual bodily
contact, whether directly or indirectly through the clothing
or other material intended to cover the body.
2 Such a
 
construction would be contrary to the commonsense
understanding imparted by the statute's choice of words.
2 The concept of indirect bodily touching is
explicitly articulated elsewhere in the Hawai' i 
Penal Code. HRS § 707-700 (1993) defines"sexual contact" as the "touching of the sexual

 Because Pesentheiner does not contest the
 
district court's finding that his contact with
Officer Takahashi's hat was "offensive" under
 HRS § 711-1106(1)(a), we do not visit that issue
here.

or other intimate parts of a person not married
to the actor, or of the sexual or other intimate
parts of the actor by the person, whether
directly or through the clothing or other
material intended to cover the sexual or other
 
intimate parts." See also Model Penal Code
 
§ 250.4(4) comment (1980) (advising that the
Model Penal Code subsection cognate with HRS §
711-1106(1)(a) "should be considered in
connection with" the Model Penal Code section
 cognate with HRS § 707-700). 
That said, we move to examine whether Pesentheiner
nonetheless violated the alternative prohibition of HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a), against "offensive physical contact[.]"
Pesentheiner argues that "offensive physical contact" should
be strictly construed to mean only actual contact with or
touching of another individual's person.
3 However, as
stated above, the plain language of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a)
makes clear that the statute already proscribes such actions
in its first prohibition against "[s]trik[ing], shov[ing],
kick[ing], or otherwise touch[ing] another person[.]"
As a general rule, "[c]ourts are bound to give effect
to all parts of a statute, and . . . no clause, sentence, or
word shall be construed as superfluous, void, or
insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found
which will give force to and preserve all words of the
statute." In re Doe, 90 Hawai' i 246, 250, 978 P.2d 684, 688
(1999).
 In light of this consideration, it becomes apparent
that "offensive physical contact" must constitute more than
simply the "touch[ing] [of] another person in an offensive
manner" if the phrase in the disjunctive is to hold any
independent meaning or effect.
 
We believe that "offensive physical contact"
encompasses the conduct in question here, offensive contact
that, while separate and apart from the various forms of
actual bodily touching, nevertheless involves contact with
an item physically appurtenant to the body.[] We believe
 that such a construction is mandated by the plain meaning of
HRS § 711-1106(1)(a), read in its entirety.
 
Id. at 294-95, 22 P.3d at 90-91 (emphasis added and footnote
 
omitted).
 
Because "offensive physical contact" has an independent
 
and separate meaning from "touches another person in an offensive
 
manner,"2
 the terms are not synonymous and the former is not
2
 We construe the State's use of the term "offensive touching" to be
similar to the use of the same term by this court in Pesentheiner, which used
it interchangeably for the term "touched in an offensive manner."

inclusive of the latter. 
As this court stated in State v. McCarthy, 124 Hawai' i 
129, 237 P.3d 1195, No. 29701 2010 WL 3433722, at *1 (App. 
Aug. 31, 2010) (mem.), 
Alternatively, this court has recommended that the
better approach is to phrase the complaint in both the
conjunctive and the disjunctive. "[T]he most appropriate
method to allege one offense committed in two different ways
is to allege in one count that the defendant committed the
offense (a) in one way 'and/or' (b) in a second way." State
 v. Cabral, 8 Haw. App. 506, 511, 810 P.2d 672, 675-76
(1991). The supreme court has expressed agreement. State v.
 Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 250, 831 P.2d 924, 932 (1992).
 
McCarthy, 2010 WL 3433722 at *4 (footnote omitted).
 
Because the charge was fatally defective, the family
 
court lacked jurisdiction over the case and we need not address
 
Mokiau's claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict
 
him.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Final Judgment and
 
Sentence of the Family Court of the First Circuit, entered on
 February 10, 2011, is vacated and the case is remanded with
 
instructions to dismiss the case without prejudice.
