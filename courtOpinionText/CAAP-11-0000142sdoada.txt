NO. CAAP-11-0000142
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE TRUST ESTATE OF
 
DON HO, also known as DONALD TAI LOY HO
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(TRUST NO. 08-1-0013)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Dorianne Ho a.k.a. Dorianne L.
 
DeMattos (DeMattos) appeals pro se from a February 7, 2011 order
 
granting Petitioners-Appellees the Trustees of the Don Ho
 
Revocable Living Trust's (Trustees') June 28, 2010 petition to
 
compel arbitration and for the appointment of an arbitrator
 
(Order Compelling Arbitration) entered by the Circuit Court of
 
the First Circuit, Probate Division (Probate Court).1
 
Respondents-Appellants Elizabeth Guevara and Donalei Ho filed pro
 
se a "Joint Notice of Appeal" with DeMattos, but did not file
 
briefs or otherwise prosecute their appeals herein. 
The Joint Notice of Appeal also purported to appeal
 
from the following three orders of the Probate Court: (1) the
 
July 9, 2008 order granting the Trustees' petition for
 
reformation of trust; (2) the April 6, 2009 order granting the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Trustees' petition to enforce a settlement agreement and compel
 
arbitration; and (3) the April 14, 2010 order denying DeMattos's
 
petition to stay arbitration. However, as set forth in the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeal's January 30, 2012 order denying the
 
Trustees' motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction,
 
this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the July 9,
 
2008 order, the April 6, 2009 order, and the April 14, 2010
 
order.
 
DeMattos's brief fails in numerous and substantial ways 
to comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
28(b)(4), but nevertheless enumerates four points of error, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) reforming the 
trust; (2) enforcing the settlement agreement; (3) enforcing the 
arbitration clause in the settlement agreement; and (4) approving 
the arbitration award and entering final judgment in this matter. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 
DeMattos's points of error as follows:
 
DeMattos's failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4),
 
including her failure to include record references, and/or
 
evidence or cogent legal arguments in support of any relief from
 
the Probate Court's Order Compelling Arbitration severely hampers
 
our review of this case. Nevertheless, it appears that DeMattos
 
is challenging the Probate Court's decision to compel
 
arbitration. It further appears that it is indisputable that the
 
settlement agreement entered into by DeMattos contains an
 
arbitration agreement and that the subject matter of this dispute
 
falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. See Koolau
 
Radiology, Inc. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 445, 834 P.2d
 1294, 1300 (1992) ("[W]hen presented with a motion to compel
 
arbitration, the court is limited to answering two questions: 1)
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties; and 
2) if so, whether the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable 
under such agreement."). Even if all or part of the settlement 
agreement itself was unenforceable, the parties' agreement to 
arbitrate may be enforced. Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 1, 4, 911 
P.2d 721, 724 (1996) ("[A]rbitration clauses are separable from 
the contracts in which they are embedded, and where no claim is 
made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself, a 
broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of 
the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.") 
(citation omitted). 
As noted above, we do not have appellate jurisdiction
 
to address alleged errors in the other orders challenged by
 
DeMattos in this appeal.
 
Accordingly, we affirm the Probate Court's February 7,
 
2011 Order Compelling Arbitration.2
