HAWAI'I ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, INC., Claimant-Appellee, v.
TAWHIRI POWER LLC, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 10-1-0390)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginzoa, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Tawhiri Power, LLC (Tawhiri) 
appeals from a February 24, 2011 Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (Circuit Court) (1) Order Granting Claimant-Appellee 
Hawai'i Electric Light Company, Inc.'s (HELCO) Motion to Confirm 
Arbitration Award (Order Confirming Arbitration Award) and (2) 
Judgment.1 HELCO and Tawhiri, formerly known as Apollo Energy 
Corporation (Apollo), entered into a Restated and Amended Power Purchase Contract for As-Available Energy (RAC), which required 
that Tawhiri construct the Kamao
'a Switching Station. A dispute 
arose between HELCO and Tawhiri over responsibility for the Kamao
'a Switching Station construction cost overruns (True-Up

, a
 Issue).   Pursuant to an arbitration provision in the RAC

 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.

three-member arbitration panel (Panel)  found that under the RAC,
HELCO's contribution for costs incurred in connection with 
construction of the Kamao 'a Switching Station was fixed at 
$782,300. HELCO filed a Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award, which the Circuit Court granted. 
Tawhiri raises a single point of error on appeal,
 
maintaining that the Circuit Court erred in confirming the
 
arbitration award insofar as it related to the True-Up Issue
 
because the panel adjudicated an issue not properly before it and
 
exceeded its powers.
 
After careful review of the issues raised and arguments
 
made by the parties, the record on appeal, and applicable legal
 
authorities, we resolve Tawhiri's point on appeal as follows and
 
affirm.
 
In light of the plain language of HRS § 658A-22 (Supp.
 
5
2013) and the Hawai 'i Supreme Court's interpretation of the 
analogous provisions of HRS Chapter 658, Tawhiri waived its right 
2(...continued)
costs shall be reasonable, include the cost of the Kamao' a Switching Station
(except for $782,300, which shall be Company's [HELCO's] fixed cost
contribution toward such cost). . . ." Similarly, Section 1(a)(2)(a) of theRAC Appendix C states that Tawhiri shall design and construct the switchingstation at its expense, except that HELCO "shall be responsible for $782,300of the costs of the Kamao' a Switching Station[,]" which is HELCO's "fixed
contribution[.]" 
3 The RAC required that the parties arbitrate "any dispute under
this RAC[.]" It further provided that arbitration will be held in accordance
with the prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) for
commercial arbitration.

Scott H. Strauss, Esq. and Kale Feldman, Esq.

 HRS § 658A-22 provides:
 
[§658A-22] Confirmation of award.  After a party to an
arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the
party may make a motion to the court for an order confirming
the award at which time the court shall issue a confirming
order unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to
section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section
658A-23.

to judicial review of the arbitration award by filing a Memo in
 
Opposition to HELCO's Motion to Confirm rather than moving to
 
modify or correct the arbitration award pursuant to HRS § 658A-24
 
(Supp. 2013), or vacate the award pursuant to § 658A-23 (Supp.
 
2013). See Arbitration of Bd. of Dirs. of Ass'n of Apartment
 
Owners of Tropicana Manor, 73 Haw. 201, 213, 830 P.2d 503, 510
 (1992) ("By seeking clarification of the unambiguous original
 
award instead of moving to vacate, modify, or correct the award
 
pursuant to HRS §§ 658-9 and 658-10, or demanding a trial de novo
 
pursuant to HRS § 514A-127 in a timely fashion, appellees waived
 
their right to any judicial review of the award.").
 
Our "primary duty in interpreting and applying statutes
 
is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature's intention to
 
the fullest degree." Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Ferreira, 71
 
Haw. 341, 345, 790 P.2d 910, 913 (1990). We do this by first
 looking at the language of the statute itself. Id. "[W]here the
 
statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to
 give effect to its plain and obvious meaning." Id.
 
The plain language of HRS § 658A-22 unambiguously
 
states that where a party moves the court to confirm an
 
arbitration award, the court must confirm the award "unless the
 
award is modified or corrected pursuant to section 658A-20 or
 
658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section 658A-23." (Emphasis
 
added.)
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court's strict interpretation of 
the analogous provisions of Chapter 658 supports our conclusion.

Eyecor, Ltd., 74 Haw. 210, 227, 847 P.2d 652, 660 (1992)

Here, it is undisputed that Tawhiri did not file a 
motion to modify, correct, or vacate the award. Thus, pursuant 
to the plain language of HRS § 658A-22, the Circuit Court was 
statutorily mandated to confirm the award. See Malahoff v. 
Saito, 111 Hawai 'i 168, 191, 140 P.3d 401, 424 (2006) ("It is 
well-established that, where a statute contains the word 'shall,' 
the provision generally will be construed as mandatory."). 
"Departure from the plain and unambiguous language of the statute 
cannot be justified without a clear showing that the legislature 
intended some other meaning would be given to the language." 
Cnty of Hawai 'i v. UNIDEV, LLC, 129 Hawai 'i 378, 393, 301 P.3d 
588, 603 (2013) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). The "clear intention" of the legislature "is to 
encourage arbitration as a means of settling differences and 
thereby avoid[] litigation." Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai
'i 
386, 395, 114 P.3d 892, 901 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). 
In light of the foregoing, given that Tawhiri seeks to
 
challenge the arbitration award but failed to file a motion to
 
vacate, modify, or correct pursuant to HRS § 658A-23 or § 658A­
24, it would ordinarily be foreclosed from appealing the
 
confirmation order. However, Tawhiri argues in its Reply Brief
 
that the panel lacked authority to adjudicate the True-Up Issue
 
is a threshold jurisdictional issue, which cannot be waived.
 
In Tropicana Manor, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that 
an arbitrator exceeded his authority by reopening an arbitration 
hearing after issuing an award. 73 Haw. at 203, 830 P.2d at 505.

amount of an arbitration award must timely move 
either to vacate the award
under HRS § 658-9 or to modify or correct it under HRS § 658-10." Mathewson, 
82 Hawai' i at 82, 919 P.2d at 994 (emphases in original). 
Moreover, the Hawai' i Supreme Court in Gepaya v. State Farm Mutual 
Auto. Ins. Co., 94 Hawai' i 362, 14 P.3d 1043 (2000) stated that "[i]f the
motion brought by the moving party does not come within one of the [] specific
grounds [set forth in HRS § 658-9 or § 658-10], the circuit court is powerlessto vacate, modify, or correct an award and has no alternative but to confirmthe award and to enter a judgment accordingly." 94 Hawai' i at 366, 14 P.3d at
1047 (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).

In reaching its conclusion, the court found that appellants could
 
not have waived their right to object to the arbitrator's
 
authority to reopen the hearing and issue an amended award even
 
though they participated in the reopened proceedings "because a
 
jurisdictional issue as to the arbitrator's authority to reopen
 
the hearing is involved[.]" Tropicana Manor, 73 Haw. at 211, 830
 
P.2d at 509. 
"Judicial review is limited to cases in which the 
arbitrators manifestly exceed the agreement between the parties." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai
'i 226, 234, 54 P.3d 397, 405 
(2002). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has "reserved the phrase 
'exceeded their powers' as reference to arbitrators' improper 
consideration of matters outside the scope of the arbitration 
agreement[.]" Id., at 235, 54 P.3d at 406. "Undue judicial 
review, and subsequent interference, would not only stymie legislative intent but would also thwart the intent of the 
parties." Id., at 236, 54 P.3d at 407. 
"Under Hawai
'i law, any doubts concerning the scope of 
arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration." 
UNIDEV, 129 Hawai 'i at 394, 301 P.3d at 604 (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). We determine "[w]hat issues, if any, are beyond the scope of a contractual agreement to 
arbitrate [] on the wording of the contractual agreement to 
arbitrate." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted, 
emphasis in original). We interpret an arbitration agreement like a contract. Id., at 395, 301 P.3d at 605. "As with any 
contract, the parties' intentions control, but those intentions are generously construed as to issues of arbitrability." Lee v. 
Heftel, 81 Hawai
'i 1, 4, 911 P.2d 721, 724 (1996) (citation, 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Assuming, arguendo, that Tawhiri's arguments amount to
 
a challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, we conclude
 
that the arbitration provision here, i.e., that the parties
 
arbitrate "any dispute under [the] RAC[,]" constitutes a
 
"general" arbitration clause and should be construed broadly to
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
include the True-Up Issue. UNIDEV, 129 Hawai 'i at 395, 301 P.3d 
at 605 (arbitration provision including "[a]ny dispute arising 
under the terms of this Agreement" was a general clause and to be 
interpreted broadly). Interpretation of the arbitration 
provision's scope to exclude the True-Up Issue "appears 
unnecessarily narrow[,]" Id., especially given that the RAC 
specifically addressed the parties' responsibilities for the cost 
of the Kamao 'a Switching Station and, as in UNIDEV, "the general 
arbitration clause contained no limiting language that could have narrowed its scope." Id.
, at 395-96, 301 P.3d at 605-06 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Therefore, the February 24, 2011 Order Confirming 
Arbitration Award and Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
