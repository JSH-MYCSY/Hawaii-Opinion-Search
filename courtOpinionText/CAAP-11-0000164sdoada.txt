Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 
Petitioner From Custody (Order Denying Third Rule 40 Petition),
 
filed on February 16, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On November 22, 1995, Jones was convicted of Sexual
 
Assault in the First Degree and Kidnapping. Jones was sentenced
 
to an extended term sentence, pursuant to HRS ยง 706-662(4), of
 
life with the possibility of parole for Sexual Assault in the
 
First Degree and twenty years of incarceration for Kidnapping. 
In his direct appeal, Jones argued, inter alia, that
 
extended term sentencing violated his due process rights.

Jones's conviction was affirmed in a summary disposition order by 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court on June 9, 1997, in S.Ct. No. 20090. 
On November 5, 1998, Jones filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (First Petition), pursuant to Rule 40 of the 
Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). In his First Petition, 
Jones argued that he was denied effective assistance of trial 
counsel and appellate counsel. On June 7, 2000, the First 
Petition was denied. On June 7, 2002, the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
affirmed the denial of the First Petition in a summary 
disposition order filed in S.Ct. No. 23533. 
On October 18, 2005, Jones filed another Petition for
 
Post-Conviction Relief (Second Petition). Jones claimed that he
 
was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel at trial
 
and on appeal. On March 15, 2006, the Second Petition was
 
denied.
 
On October 29, 2009, Jones filed a Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From
 
Custody (Third Petition), pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. In his Third
 
Petition, Jones claimed that: (1) his constitutional rights
 
under the Hawaii State Constitution and his Fifth and Sixth
 
Amendment rights under the United States Constitution were denied
 
when his sentence was enhanced based on factors other than a
 
prior conviction; (2) he was denied his constitutional right to
 
effective assistance of counsel on his appeal of his First
 
Petition; and (3) he was denied his right to effective assistance
 
of counsel on his direct appeal. Jones's stated reason for
 
raising these grounds for the first time is that he "did not
 
learn about the Apprendi case until after my first appeal and
 
first Rule 40 petition were denied. Both my trial and appellate
 
counsel failed to raise the issue."
 
On February 16, 2011, the Circuit Court issued the
 
Order Denying Third Rule 40 Petition. Jones timely filed this
 
appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Jones contends the Circuit Court erred by
 
denying his Third Petition because: (1) he was entitled to have
 
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), applied to his case;
 
(2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel on the appeal
 
from the denial of his First Petition; and (3) he was denied
 
effective assistance of counsel in his direct appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Jones's points of error as follows:
 
"The holding in Apprendi clearly does not apply 
retroactively in proceedings which collaterally attack a 
sentence." Loher v. State, 118 Hawai' i 522, 534 n.10, 193 P.3d 
438, 450 n.10 (App. 2008) (citing State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai' i 
308, 312, 113 P.3d 184, 188 (2005)). 
Jones does not cite any authority to support his claim
 
that he has a right to effective assistance of counsel in a post-
conviction proceeding, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. Even if Jones
 
was entitled to effective assistance of counsel for a petition
 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40, he has not identified an error or
 
omission by counsel "resulting in the withdrawal or substantial
 
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." See Briones v.
 
State, 74 Haw. 442, 465-66, 848 P.2d 966, 977 (1993).
 
Jones's claim that he was denied effective assistance
 
of counsel in his direct appeal was previously raised and ruled
 upon in his First and Second Petitions. Therefore, relief is not
 
available pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3); Stanley
 
v. State, 76 Hawai' i 446, 450-51, 879 P.2d 551, 555-56 (1994). 
Even if Jones's counsel in his direct appeal and on 
appeal of his First Petition had raised arguments similar to or 
based upon Apprendi, "under then-existing Hawai' i law, his 
arguments would have been rejected." Loher, 118 Hawai' i at 538, 
193 P.3d at 454. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective. Id.
