APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
ORDER DENYING OCTOBER 19, 2011 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION OF OCTOBER 10, 2011 ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
LACK OF JURISDICTION, OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR DEPUBLICATION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the October 10, 2011 order
 
dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction, (2) Defendants/Cross-
Claim Plaintiffs/Plaintiffs/Appellants Kimberly Ann Eiko Lee and
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Daniel Morris Lee's (the Lee Appellants) motion for 
reconsideration of the October 10, 2011 dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
or, in the alternative, for depublication, and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook or misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the October 10, 2011 dismissal order. Therefore, the Lee Appellants' October 19, 2011 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the October 10, 2011 dismissal order lacks merit. Furthermore, the October 10, 2011 dismissal order is not a published opinion, and, thus, the Lee Appellants' alternative request for depublication lacks merit. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Lee Appellants'
 
October 19, 2011 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
 October 10, 2011 dismissal order, or, in the alternative, for
 depublication, is denied.
