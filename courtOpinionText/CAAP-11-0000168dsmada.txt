APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-178K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Wheels of
 
Justice, LLC's (Appellant), May 27, 2011 jurisdiction statement,
 
and (2) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over the
 appeal that Appellant has asserted from the Honorable Ronald
 Ibarra's March 3, 2011 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion to Set
 Aside Order of Dismissal Filed January 10, 2011" (the March 3,
 2011 order).

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
adopted Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n order 
disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of 
Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation 
omitted; emphasis added). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai'i has held that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding 
dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii 
Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) 
(emphasis added). In contrast, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) 
(citation omitted). Because a judgment has already been entered 
by the time when a post-judgment proceeding takes place, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai'i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
At first glance, Appellant’s appeal from the March 3,
 
2011 order might appear to be an appealable post-judgment order,
 because 
(a) HRCP Rule 60(b) expressly authorizes relief "from a
final judgment, order, or proceeding[,]" 
(b) "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment reliefunder HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final orderunder HRS § 641-1(a)" (Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 
at 160, 80 P.3d at 981 (citation omitted), and 
(c) 
the March 3, 2011 order denied Appellant Wheels ofJustice's motion to set aside the circuit court's January 10, 2011 dismissal order pursuant to Rule12(q) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the Stateof Hawai' i (RCCH). 
However, although the March 3, 2011 order denied Appellant’s
 
motion to set aside the January 10, 2011 RCCH dismissal order,
 the January 10, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was not an
 independently appealable order, because the circuit court did not
 reduce it to a separate judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 58. Price
 
v. Obayashi Hawaii Corporation, 81 Hawai' i at 176, 914 P.2d at 
1369 (a dismissal order is not eligible for appellate review absent the entry of a separate judgment). As an order that was not independently appealable, the January 10, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was not a "judgment," as defined by HRCP Rule 54(a). See HRCP Rule 54(a) ("'Judgment' as used in 
these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
lies."). Hawai' i appellate courts have held that "a motion for 
reconsideration, pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), is authorized only 
in situations involving final judgments." Cho v. State, 115 
Hawai'i 373, 382, 168 P.3d 17, 26 (2007) (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted); Crown Properties, Inc. v. Financial Security Life Insurance Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985) ("A Rule 60(b), HRCP, motion is authorized only in situations involving final judgments."); Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochrane, 8 Haw. App. 256, 262, 799 P.2d 60, 65 (1990) ("Rule 60(b) applies to motions seeking to amend final orders in the nature of judgments."). Similarly in federal courts, "[t]he standard test for whether a judgment is 'final' for Rule 60(b) purposes is usually stated to be whether the judgment is sufficiently 'final' to be appealed." 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 60.23, at 81-82 (3d ed. 2009) (footnote omitted). Thus, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has explained that "Rule 60(b) [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] . . . applies only to motions attacking final, appealable orders[.]" United States v. Martin, 226 F.3d 
th
1042, 1048 n.8 (9  Cir. 2000) (emphases added).  The January 10,
 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order is not a final judgment and
 is subject to revision before a final judgment is entered. 
See, HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, in filing its motion to set
 aside the circuit court's January 10, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q)
 dismissal order, Appellant was invoking the circuit court's
 inherent authority to revise any and all interlocutory orders
 prior to the entry of a judgment. Because the January 10, 2011
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was not an appealable judgment, 
and because the circuit court did not enter any appealable judgment pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338, HRCP 
Rule 60(b) did not apply to Appellant’s motion to set aside the circuit court's January 10, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order. Consequently, the March 3, 2011 order is not a "post-judgment order" from which a party may appeal. Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
