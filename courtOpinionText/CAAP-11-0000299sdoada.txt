IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
HAWAIIAN DREDGING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, INC.,
Petitioner-Appellee, v. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellant, and

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0832-04)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
This is a secondary appeal arising out of a State of 
Hawai'i (State) procurement dispute involving Respondent-
Appellant-Appellant State Department of Transportation (DOT), 
Petitioner-Appellee-Appellee Hawaiian Dredging Construction 
Company, Inc. (Hawaiian Dredging), and Intervenor-Appellant-
Appellee Goodfellow Bros., Inc. (Goodfellow). DOT appeals from 
the March 1, 2011 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the 
1
First Circuit (Circuit Court),  in favor of Hawaiian Dredging,
and against DOT and Goodfellow, affirming the Department of
 
Commerce and Consumer Affairs' (
DCCA) Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law and Decision, entered on April 3, 2009 (PCH­
2009-1 Decision), which concluded that Hawaiian Dredging was
 
entitled to an award of proposal preparation costs under Hawaii

Revised Statutes (HRS) § 103D-701(g) (2012).  DOT also
 
challenges the following: (1) a September 1, 2009 order, which
 
denied DOT and Goodfellow's requests to take judicial notice of 
DCCA's subsequent findings of fact, conclusions of law and
 decision, entered on July 2, 2009, (PCH-2009-9 Decision) on a
 
related matter; and (2) an oral ruling by the Circuit Court on
 
August 26, 2009, which denied consolidation of DOT and
 Goodfellow's appeal from the PCH-2009-1 Decision with Hawaiian
 Dredging's appeal from the PCH-2009-9 Decision.
 
In its points of error on this appeal, DOT contends
 
that the Circuit Court erred when it: 
(1) denied the State's
 
motion to take judicial notice of PCH-2009-9 Decision; (2)
 refused to consolidate the appeals of the PCH-2009-1 Decision and
 the PCH-2009-9 Decision; and (3) affirmed the DCCA's award of
 proposal preparation costs to Hawaiian Dredging.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve DOT's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) DOT challenges the Circuit Court's denial of its
 
motion for judicial notice on the ground that the Circuit Court
 "foreclosed its ability to have the full record of pertinent
 facts on the issue of the appropriateness of a proposal
 preparation costs award to [Hawaiian Dredging]." DOT also points
 
to the DCCA's footnote in the PCH-2009-9 Decision, which notes
 
that costs were awarded in the PCH-2009-1 Decision because
 Hawaiian Dredging's proposal "was not in evidence and therefore
 not subject to review." Therefore, DOT argues, the Circuit Court
 "disregarded the compelling circumstances in this case[,]" by
 refusing to take judicial notice of the PCH-2009-9 Decision.

 HRS § 103D-701(g) (2012) provides:
 
In addition to any other relief, when a protest is
sustained and the protestor should have been awarded the
contract under the solicitation but is not, then the
protestor shall be entitled to the actual costs reasonably
incurred in connection with the solicitation, including bid
or proposal preparation costs but not attorney's fees.

Judicial review may be instituted in the Circuit Court
 
by parties who are aggrieved by a final decision of a hearings
 
officer in a section 103D-709 administrative proceeding. HRS
 § 103D-710(a) (2012). Review "shall be conducted on the record
 of the administrative proceedings, and briefs and oral
 argument."
3 HRS § 103D-710(d) (2012) (emphasis added). Moreover,
 
[n]o new evidence shall be introduced, except that the
circuit court may, if evidence is offered which is clearly
newly discovered evidence and material to the just decision
of the appeal, admit the same.
 
Id. Upon review of the administrative record, the Circuit Court
 
may affirm the decision of the hearings officer, remand the case
 
with instructions for further proceedings, or reverse or modify
 the decision and order 
if substantial rights may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are: . . . (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
HRS § 103D-710(e) (2012).
 
A court is limited in its review of a HRS § 103D-709 
administrative proceeding to the record of that proceeding, 
except that "newly discovered evidence" which is material to the appeal may be admitted. While the Hawai
'i courts have not yet 
analyzed the application or use of the "newly discovered evidence" exception of HRS § 103D-710(d), generally, "newly discovered evidence" is evidence that is discovered after trial, which could not have been discovered before or at trial through the exercise of due diligence. See, e.g., State v. Mabuti, 72 
Haw. 106, 112, 807 P.2d 1264, 1268 (1991) (defining "newly discovered evidence" in the context of a motion for new trial). 
The PCH-2009-9 Decision was based entirely on Hawaiian
 
Dredging's proposal as it existed at the time of the PCH-2009-1
 proceeding. The PCH-2009-9 Decision did not invoke newly

 HAR § 3-126-66(a) states that the record shall consist of: "(1)
All pleadings, motions, and intermediate rulings; (2) All evidence received or
considered, including without limitations, oral testimony, exhibits, and
matters officially noted by the hearings officer; (3) All offers of proof and
rulings thereon; and (4) All proposed findings and exceptions."

discovered evidence in the PCH-2009-1 proceeding, as any flaws in 
Hawaiian Dredging's proposal could have been brought to the Hearing Officer's attention in the PCH-2009-1 proceeding. DOT's failure to have done so does not allow DOT to introduce the PCH­2009-9 Decision as "newly discovered evidence" on the appeal from the prior decision. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court in Kelly v. 1250 
Oceanside Partners cited a handful of cases from other jurisdictions which stand for the proposition that it is a party's responsibility to present evidence at trial in order to support its case.
4 111 Hawai 'i 205, 233-34, 140 P.3d 985, 1013­
14 (2006). DOT failed to do so here and attempted to cure their failure on appeal to the Circuit Court through judicial notice. 
Hawai
'i courts have consistently held that a court's 
review of an administrative agency's decision is limited to issues properly raised in the record of the administrative proceedings. See, e.g., Kilauea Neighborhood Ass'n v. Land Use 
Comm'n, 7 Haw. App. 227, 236, 751 P.2d 1031, 1037 (1988) ("Judicial review of an agency decision is confined to the record of the agency proceedings."); HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Indus. Licensing Bd., Dep't of Commerce & Consumer Affairs, 69 Haw. 135, 141, 736 P.2d 1271, 1275 (1987) (Judicial review of an agency 
4 Specifically the Kelly Court cites the following:
 
Greenfield v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., 848 So. 2d 30, 33 (La. App.
2003) (stating that neither the trial court nor the appellate
courts can consider documents that were "never properly offered,
introduced, or admitted into evidence," as "[u]ntil such evidence
is introduced, the opposing party has no opportunity to legally
confront possibly determinative evidence"); David v. Cajun
Painting, Inc., 631 So. 2d 1176, 1181 (La. App. 1994) (ruling that
"[e]vidence filed into the record, but not introduced formally at
trial, may not be considered by the appellate court"); Imprint
Techs., Inc. v. Comm'r of Economic Sec., 535 N.W.2d 372 (Minn.
App. 1995) (ruling that "matters not received into evidence at the
trial may not be considered on appeal"); 1 John W. Strong, et.
al., McCormick on Evidence, § 51, at 194 (4th ed. 1992) (noting
that the adversarial system "imposes on the parties the burden of
presenting evidence at the trial pursuant to rules and practices
that make it clear when proof has been presented so that it is
officially introduced and thereupon can be considered by the trier
of fact in the resolution of fact issues").

determination must be "confined to issues properly raised in the
 
record of the administrative proceedings below.").5
 
We also consider Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
201, which governs the judicial notice of adjudicative facts and
 provides:
 
A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to
reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known
within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, or
(2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.
 
HRE Rule 201(a). Generally, whether or not a court takes 
judicial notice of adjudicative facts is within the court's discretion, however, a court "shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information." HRE Rule 201(c), (d). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
in State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165, 706 P.2d 1300, 1302 (1985), reported that it has "validated the practice of taking judicial notice of a court's own records in an interrelated proceeding where the parties are the same." In Akana, the State requested the trial court to take judicial notice of its own file, which was in the immediate possession of the court. Id. at 166, 706 
P.2d at 1302. Because it was clear that the ready availability and accuracy of the court records in the file could not be questioned, the trial court was mandated to take judicial notice of the court records pursuant to HRE 201. Those circumstances are distinguishable from the facts in the instant case. 
Here, at the time that DOT made its request to the
 
Circuit Court to take judicial notice of the PCH-2009-9 Decision,
 Hawaiian Dredging was appealing that decision before the Circuit
 Court. The PCH-2009-9 proceeding was directly related to the
 matter at issue, but it was "subject to reasonable dispute" and
 its accuracy could reasonably be questioned. Although Hawaiian

 Although these articulations of policy are based on HRS § 91-14,
the Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that at least some provisions of HRS
§ 103D-710 are virtually identical to those in HRS § 91-14. See CARL Corp. v. 
Haw. Dept. of Education, 85 Hawai' i 431, 446-47, 946 P.2d 1, 16-17 (1997).
Additionally, the policy of confining judicial review of an agency decision to
the record before the agency comports with HRS § 103D-710(d)'s requirementthat judicial review "shall be conducted on the record of the administrativeproceedings." 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dredging later withdrew its appeal of the PCH-2009-9 Decision,
 
DOT did not renew its request to take judicial notice of the
 uncontested decision at that time. Akana is further
 
distinguished from the instant case in that here, the Circuit
 Court was not the finder of fact in the PCH-2009-9 Decision;
 rather, DCCA was the finder of fact. As such, the Circuit Court
 was not asked to take judicial notice of the court's "own
 records," but rather those of the DCCA. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not
 
err when it entered its order denying DOT's request for judicial
 notice because (1) the PCH-2009-9 Decision was not "newly
 discovered evidence," as required under HRS § 103D-710(d), as it
 was based on evidence then existing at the time of the PCH-2009-1
 proceeding, and (2) at the time of the request, the findings of
 fact and conclusions of law of the PCH-2009-9 Decision were being
 appealed by Hawaiian Dredging and, therefore, were subject to
 reasonable dispute. 
(2) Appellate courts "may not decide moot questions or
 
abstract propositions of law." Life of the Land v. Burns, 59
 
Haw. 244, 250, 580 P.2d 405, 409 (1978).
 
It is well-settled that the mootness doctrine encompasses
the circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a case
previously suitable for determination. A case is moot where
 the question to be determined is abstract and does not rest
on existing facts or rights. Thus, the mootness doctrine is
properly invoked where events have so affected the relations
between the parties that the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal - adverse interest and
effective remedy - have been compromised.
 
In re Thomas, 73 Haw. 223, 225-26, 832 P.2d 253, 254 (1992)
 
(citing Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Haw., 62 Haw. 391, 394,
 616 P.2d 201, 203-04 (1980)) (ellipsis and internal quotation
 marks omitted).
 
DOT argues that the Circuit Court erred in refusing its
 
oral request to consolidate the appeals of PCH-2009-1 Decision
 and PCH-2009-9 Decision.  Hawaiian Dredging objected to the
 
consolidation. Because there was no objection to consolidating
 
DOT's and Goodfellow's appeals from PCH-2009-1 Decision, the
 Circuit Court consolidated those appeals. However, the Circuit
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court refused DOT's oral request to consolidate the appeals from
 
PCH-2009-1 Decision with Hawaiian Dredging's appeal of PCH-2009-9
 Decision and instructed DOT to "file a motion to consolidate
 [those] appeals." There is nothing in the record on appeal to
 suggest that such motion was ever filed. 
Later, at the oral argument on the PCH-2009-1
 
consolidated appeals, Hawaiian Dredging requested approval from
 the Circuit Court to withdraw its appeal of the PCH-2009-9
 Decision filed July 2, 2009. The Circuit Court granted the
 request.
 
Because Hawaiian Dredging's appeal of DCCA's decision
 
in PCH-2009-9 is no longer being pursued, the issue of
 consolidation is moot. 
(3) Part VII of the Procurement Code, entitled "Legal
 
and Contractual Remedies," sets out the procedure for resolving a
 variety of problems that may arise during the procurement
 process. See HRS §§ 103D-701 to -713 (2012). HRS § 103D-701(a)
 
allows a prospective bidder, offeror, or contractor who is
 aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a
 contract to protest to the chief procurement officer or a
 designee as specified in the solicitation. If the protest is not
 resolved by mutual agreement, the chief procurement officer or a
 designee is required to issue a decision in writing to uphold or
 deny the protest. HRS § 103D-701(c). "The several hearings
 officers appointed by the director of the department of commerce
 and consumer affairs . . . shall have jurisdiction to review and
 determine de novo, any request from any bidder, offeror, [or]
 contractor . . . aggrieved by a determination of the chief
 procurement officer . . . or a designee . . . under [HRS] section
 . . . 103D-701[.]" HRS § 103D-709(a). The hearings officer 
shall decide whether the determinations of the chief
 
procurement officer or the chief procurement officer's
designee were in accordance with the Constitution, statutes,
rules, and the terms and conditions of the solicitation or
contract, and shall order such relief as may be appropriate
in accordance with this chapter.
 
HRS § 103D-709(h) (emphasis added). HRS section 103D-701(g)
 
(Supp. 2011) provides:
 
7
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition to any other relief, when a protest is sustained
and the protestor should have been awarded the contract
under the solicitation but is not, then the protestor shall
be entitled to the actual costs reasonably incurred in
connection with the solicitation, including bid or proposal
preparation costs but not attorney's fees.
 
By its express terms, a protesting bidder "shall" be 
entitled to recover its bid preparation costs pursuant to HRS 
§ 103D-701(g) "if: (1) the protest is sustained; (2) the protestor should have been awarded the contract; and (3) the protestor is not awarded the contract." CARL Corp., 85 Hawai
'i 
at 456, 946 P.2d at 26. 
Because the DCCA determined that Goodfellow's proposal 
was nonresponsive, Hawaiian Dredging's protest was sustained. Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Hawaiian Dredging was not awarded the Project contract. These issues are uncontested. The only remaining issue is whether the Hearings Officer erroneously determined that Hawaiian Dredging should have been awarded the Project contract. Because this issue presents a mixed question of fact and law, it is reviewed on appeal under the clearly erroneous standard. See Chun, 106 Hawai
'i at 430, 
106 P.3d at 353 (quoting Allstate Ins. Co., 105 Hawai 'i at 453, 
99 P.3d at 104). 
In the PCH-2009-1 Decision, the Hearings Officer
 
explained that Hawaiian Dredging is entitled to costs because its
 protest is sustained and because Hawaiian Dredging's point total
 was second to Goodfellow's point total. Accordingly, the
 
Hearings Officer concluded that Hawaiian Dredging "has shown by a
 
preponderance of the evidence that the contract should have been
 awarded to [Hawaiian Dredging], and as such, the Hearings Officer
 concludes that [Hawaiian Dredging] is entitled to bid preparation
 costs."
 
There is sufficient evidence in the record from which
 
the Hearings Officer could have based her conclusion that
 Hawaiian Dredging should have been awarded the Project contract. 
In a letter dated January 14, 2009, DOT stated that "[Hawaiian
 Dredging's] proposal was considered responsive, so we agree that
 [Hawaiian Dredging's] proposal met the minimum requirements of
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the RFP."  Further, the administrative record indicates that
 
Hawaiian Dredging received the second-highest score behind
 
Goodfellow. At no time during the PCH-2009-1 administrative
 proceeding did the State take the position that Hawaiian
 Dredging's bid was nonresponsive. 
On appeal, the State argues that the responsiveness of
 
Hawaiian Dredging's proposal did not come up at the hearing
 "because the issue at [the] hearing were [sic] not whether
 [Hawaiian] Dredging's proposal was responsive, it was just
 Goodfellow's that was at issue," and "[t]here was ample evidence
 in the record that [Hawaiian] Dredging also had a lane problem
 meeting the requirements of the RFP." Although the issue at the
 administrative hearing was whether Goodfellow was responsive to
 the proposal, pursuant to HRS § 103D-701, entitled "Authority to
 resolve protested solicitations and awards," if Hawaiian
 Dredging's protest was sustained, it would be entitled to bid
 preparation costs. See HRS § 103D-701(g). DOT's claim that it
 
was never given the opportunity to introduce additional evidence
 proving or disproving that Hawaiian Dredging should have been
 awarded the contract because Hawaiian Dredging did not seek an
 award of proposal preparation costs is without merit. Hawaiian
 Dredging explicitly requested in its request for an
 administrative hearing and in its closing argument that the
 Project contract should be awarded to Hawaiian Dredging. 
Accordingly, the issue of whether Hawaiian Dredging should have
 been awarded the Project contract was properly before the
 Administrative Hearings Officer, and DOT had ample opportunity to
 introduce evidence into the record to show that Hawaiian Dredging
 was not entitled to the contract.
 
Although not specifically raised by DOT at the
 
administrative level, DOT claims there was sufficient evidence in
 the record, which had it not been overlooked by the Hearings
 Officer, would have supported a finding that Hawaiian Dredging's
 proposal was nonresponsive and that it should not have been
 awarded the Project contract. Namely, DOT points to its
 spreadsheet stating that Hawaiian Dredging's proposal does not
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contain two 10-foot shoulder lanes as required by the RFP, and
 
the January 14, 2009 letter in which DOT states that Hawaiian
 Dredging's proposal was inconsistent and had deficiencies in
 meeting the RFP's shoulder lane width requirement.
 
Despite the conflicting evidence, the Hearings Officer
 
did not clearly err in determining that Hawaiian Dredging should
 have been awarded the contract and was therefore entitled to bid
 preparation costs. A mixed determination of law and fact is
 clearly erroneous when 
(1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the
finding or determination, or (2) despite substantial
evidence to support the finding or determination, the
appellate court is left with the definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been made. We have defined
 “substantial evidence” as credible evidence which is of
 sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
 
In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai 'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 
409, 431 (2000) (citation omitted). In administrative appeals 
involving public contracts, a hearing officer's factual findings, as well as conclusions of law that involve mixed questions of fact and law, are entitled to deference by a reviewing court and, as such, will not be reversed unless they are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 
Hawai
'i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) (citations omitted). 
Here, at the time of her decision, the administrative
 
Hearings Officer reasonably relied on DOT's representation that
 Hawaiian Dredging's bid was responsive. Additionally, the
 Hearings Officer stated in the PCH-2009-1 Decision that she had
 "reviewed and considered the evidence and arguments presented,
 together with the entire record of this proceeding." The record
 indicated that DOT considered Hawaiian Dredging's proposal
 responsive and agreed that "[Hawaiian Dredging]'s proposal met
 the minimum requirements of the RFP." Additionally, it was clear
 from the record that Hawaiian Dredging received the second-
highest score behind Goodfellow for its proposal. This evidence
 was of sufficient quality and probative value to enable the
 Hearings Officer to reasonably find that Hawaiian Dredging should
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
have been awarded the Project contract. See In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai 'i at 119, 9 P.3d at 431. Based on 
this information, there is nothing in the record to suggest that 
the Hearings Officer clearly erred, nor is there anything to warrant this Court's reversal of the Hearing Officer's decision as "the court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency." Dole Haw. Div. - Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71 
Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err when it affirmed the PCH-2009-1 Decision and its award of bid preparation costs to Hawaiian Dredging because the DCCA did not clearly err in its decision. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's March 1, 2011
 
Judgment is affirmed.
