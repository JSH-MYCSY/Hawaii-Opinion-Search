APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOs. 08-1-0977, 08-1-1038, 08-1-2235)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Third-Party Defendant/Third-Party Counterclaim 
Plaintiff/Fourth-Party Plaintiff/Appellant State of Hawai' i 
Department of Transportation (the State) appeals from the "Order 
Granting Tesoro Hawaii Corporation's Petition for Determination 
of Good Faith Settlement and Order of Dismissal (Order)" entered 
1
March 9, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
court). The Order (1) granted the "Petition for Determination of
 
Good Faith Settlement and Order of Dismissal (Petition)" filed by
 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff/Third-Party Plaintiff/Third-
Party Counterclaim Defendant/Appellee Tesoro Hawaii Corporation,
 
fka BHP Petroleum Americas Refining, Inc., a subsidiary of Tesoro
 
Corporation (Tesoro) as to a settlement of claims between Tesoro
 
and Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants/Appellees Island
 
Helicopters-Kauai, Inc. and Jack Harter Helicopters, Inc., and
 
Plaintiffs/Appellees Charles Dipiazza and Dragonfly Deferred
 
Trust dated 6 October 2006 (collectively, Plaintiffs) and (2)
 
dismissed Tesoro's counterclaims against Plaintiffs.
 
On appeal, the State contends the circuit court erred
 
in granting Tesoro's Petition because the provision in the
 
"Release, Indemnification And Settlement Agreement (Settlement
 
Agreement)" reserving Tesoro's right to pursue its appellate

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
claims against the State is contrary to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 663-12 (1993).2
 
Plaintiffs, operators of commercial helicopter tours on
 
Kauai, alleged Tesoro supplied them with contaminated Jet A fuel,
 
"which caused its helicopter engines to freeze up after being
 
shut off, preventing the engines from re-starting properly
 
('coking problem')." Plaintiffs filed complaints against Tesoro
 
in Civil Nos. 08-1-0977, 08-1-2235, and 08-1-1038. On January
 
22, 2010, the circuit court consolidated the three cases for
 
purposes of liability. Id.
 
The State was joined in the action based on Tesoro's
 
third-party complaint that the State's negligent maintenance and
 
operation of its fuel dispensing system at Lihue Heliport caused
 
the Plaintiffs' coking problems and damages. Cross­
Appellants/Fourth-Party Defendants Turbomeca S.A. and Turbomeca
 
USA (Turbomeca Defendants) were joined in the action based on the
 
State's complaint that Turbomeca Defendant's defective design and
 
manufacture of the Arriel engine caused the fuel coking problem
 
and the subsequent alleged economic damages.
 
On June 15, 2010, the State filed a petition in the
 
circuit court for approval of good faith settlements between the
 
State and Plaintiffs. On August 23, 2010, the circuit court3
 
granted the petition between the State and Plaintiffs,
 determining the parties had settled in good faith. On 
2
 HRS § 663-12 provides in pertinent part:
 
§663-12 Right of contribution; accrual; pro rata share.
The right of contribution exists among joint tortfeasors.
 
. . . .
 A joint tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with the
injured person is not entitled to recover contribution from
another joint tortfeasor whose liability to the injured person is
not extinguished by the settlement.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
September 10, 2010, Tesoro filed a notice of appeal.4 The appeal
 
was given appellate court case No. 30736 (No. 30736). On appeal,
 
Tesoro contended that the settlements had not been made in good
 
faith, and even if they had been made in good faith, the circuit
 
court should have stated that Tesoro was not barred from pursuing
 
its indemnity and contribution claims against the State. 
While Tesoro's appeal in No. 30736 was pending, Tesoro
 
and Plaintiffs entered into mediation and reached settlement,
 
signing the Settlement Agreement on February 15, 2011. On
 
February 22, 2011, Tesoro filed the Petition asking the circuit
 
court for a good faith settlement determination pursuant to HRS
 
§ 663-15.5 (Supp. 2010). On March 9, 2011, the circuit court
 
entered its Order granting the Petition. On March 29, 2011, the
 
State timely appealed from the Order. 
In this appeal, the State contends the Petition should
 
not have been granted because Paragraph 12.m of the Settlement
 
Agreement is contrary to HRS § 663-12. Paragraph 12.m provides:5
 
m. No effect on RELEASEES’ Appeals. It is
understood and agreed by RELEASORS that this Release shall
have no effect upon RELEASEES’ appeal to the Intermediate
Court of Appeals of the State of Hawaii from the Order
Granting Petition for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
and Dismissing All Claims Against Fourth-Party Defendants
Turbomeca SA and Turbomeca USA, Inc. filed herein on August
23, 2010, and the Order Granting Petition for Approval of
Good Faith Settlements By & Between Plaintiffs and
Third-Party Defendants/Fourth-Party Plaintiff State of
Hawaii Department of Transportation- Airports Division,
filed herein on August 23, 2010, as RELEASEES do not waive

 Tesoro also appealed from the "Order Granting Petition for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement and Dismissing All Claims Against
Fourth-Party Defendants Turbomeca S.A. and Turbomeca USA, Inc.," (Order
Granting Turbomeca's Petition) filed on August 23, 2010 in the circuit court.
On April 26, 2011, this court entered the "Order Approving Stipulation for
Partial Dismissal of Appeal," which, inter alia, dismissed Tesoro's appeal of
the Order Granting Turbomeca's Petition, but specifically noted that Tesoro's
appeal of the Order Granting State's Petition remained pending. 
5
 Tesoro's Settlement Agreement with Plaintiffs was filed under seal
pursuant to the circuit court's "Order Granting Defendant and Third-Party
Plaintiff's Ex-Parte Motion to File Exhibit "1" to Defendant and Third-Party
Plaintiff's Petition for Finding of Good Faith Settlement Under Seal."
However, in its answering brief, Tesoro provided Paragraph 12.m in its
entirety, thus waiving any confidentiality privilege as it relates to
Paragraph 12.m. Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 511 (1993).

or release in any manner by the execution of this Release
any of its claims against the Third-Party and Fourth-Party
Defendants, State of Hawaii Department of
Transportation-Airports Division and Turbomeca SA and
Turbomeca USA, Inc., respectively, and that RELEASEES shall
continue to pursue its appellate claims.
 
Paragraph 12.m provides that Tesoro's settlement with
 
Plaintiffs does not extinguish its appeal in No. 30736. This
 
court recently issued its opinion in No. 30736, affirming the
 
circuit court's determination of good faith settlements between
 
the State and Plaintiffs. See Island Helicopters-Kauai v. Tesoro
 
Hawaii, No. 30736, 2012 WL 503799 (Haw. App. Feb. 13, 2012)
 (mem.) Because the appeal in No. 30736 has been decided, Tesoro
 
has no further interest in preserving its right to pursue that
 
appeal. Any question regarding that right is moot because the
 
question can now only be determined in the abstract. 
“This court may not decide moot questions or abstract
 
propositions of law.” Life of the Land v. Burns, 59 Haw. 244,
 
250, 580 P.2d 405, 409 (1978) (citation, internal quotation marks
 and brackets omitted). 
It is well-settled that the mootness doctrine encompasses
the circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a case
previously suitable for determination. A case is moot where
the question to be determined is abstract and does not rest
on existing facts or rights. Thus, the mootness doctrine is
properly invoked where “events ... have so affected the
relations between the parties that the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal-adverse interest and
effective remedy-have been compromised.”

(ellipsis in the original) (citing Wong [v. Board of Regents,
Univ. of Hawaii], 62 Haw. [391,] 394, 616 P.2d [201,] 203-4
[1980]).

116-117, 43 P.3d 244, 253-254 (App. 2002). 
An affirmance would ostensibly require something to be done
which had already taken place. A reversal would ostensibly
avoid an event which had already passed beyond recall. One
would be as vain as the other. To adjudicate a cause which
no longer exists is a proceeding which this court uniformly
has declined to entertain.

McCabe Hamilton, 98 Hawai' i at 117, 43 P.3d at 254. 
The State's only issue in this appeal relates to
 
Tesoro's right to pursue its appeal in No. 30736. That appeal
 
has been decided and we dismiss the instant appeal as moot. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed.
