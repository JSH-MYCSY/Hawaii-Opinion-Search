STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
OTTAVIA A. ZEFFILINI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION
 
(Case No. 3P710-1722)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ottavia A. Zeffilini (Zeffilini)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and Order
 
(Judgment), entered on March 3, 2011, in the District Court of
 
the Third Circuit, North and South Kona Division (district
 
court).1 After a bench trial, the district court convicted
 
Zeffilini of Theft in the Fourth Degree (Theft 4), in violation
 
2
of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-833(1) (1993),  and
sentenced her to spend fifteen days in jail and pay a $500 fine.

 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo, Jr. presided.

 HRS § 708-833(1) provides, "A person commits the offense of theft
in the fourth degree if the person commits theft of property or services of
any value not in excess of $100." Theft 4 is a petty misdemeanor. HRS § 708­833(2).

On appeal, Zeffilini argues that the district court
 
erred in convicting her because there was insufficient evidence
 
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she possessed the
 
requisite intent.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Zeffilini's point of error as follows:
 
The district court did not err in convicting Zeffilini 
where there was substantial evidence to support her conviction. 
HRS §§ 708-833(1), 708-830(8)(a) (Supp. 2011) (defining "theft" 
and "shoplifting"), & 708-800 (1993) (defining "intent to 
defraud"). Cathy Westwood's (Westwood) testimony constituted 
substantial evidence in support of the State's contention that 
Zeffilini knowingly or intentionally took the clip-ons from the 
KTA store without permission and without paying for them. 
Although Zeffilini testified that she mistakenly put the clip-ons 
in her purse, did not exit the store, and did not mean to steal 
the clip-ons, the district court's findings reflect that it found 
Westwood's testimony of events more credible than Zeffilini's. 
See State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) 
(citation and brackets omitted) ("[P]roof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances 
surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient" to prove the 
requisite state of mind in criminal cases); State v. Eastman, 81 
Hawai'i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996) (stating that the 
testimony of a single percipient witness may constitute substantial evidence to support a conviction); State v. 
Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted) ("It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues

dependant upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the
 
evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact."). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and Order, entered on March 3, 2011 in the District
 Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona Division is
 
affirmed.
