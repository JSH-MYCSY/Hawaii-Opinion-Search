IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN RE A CHILDREN
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 09-12175)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley, and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Mother-Appellant (Mother) appeals from the "Decision
 
Re: 
Trial" (Decision), filed on March 14, 2011 in the Family
 
Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).1/ In the Decision,
 
the Family Court granted the motion for permanent custody filed
 
by the Department of Human Services (DHS), thereby terminating
 the parental rights of Mother and Father to their children, NP
 and JP (collectively, the "Children"), and awarded permanent
 custody of Children to the DHS. The Family Court, among other
 things, found that Mother was not willing and able to provide
 Children with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a
 service plan, within a reasonable period of time. 
On appeal, Mother argues that the Family Court erred in
 
terminating her parental rights and awarding permanent custody to
 the DHS because: (1) the DHS should have taken action for legal

guardianship under the Uniform Probate Code, Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) Chapter 560, rather than permanent custody under
 the Child Protective Act, HRS Chapter 587 and 587A,
2/ since
 
Mother did not harm Children; (2) the Family Court erred in
 determining that Mother was not willing and able to provide a
 safe home for Children; and (3) the DHS failed to provide Mother
 with a service plan that would give her a reasonable opportunity
 to reunite with Children. We affirm the Family Court's Decision.
 
I. 
We resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
 1. The Family Court did not err in applying the Child
 
Protective Act because a threat of harm to Children was reported
 to the DHS, and the DHS documented and presented to the court a
 compelling reasons why guardianship was not in Children's best
 interests. See HRS § 587-21, -27, & 73 (2006); HRS § 587A-11, 
-31(d)(3), & -32 (Supp. 2010). 
2. The Family Court did not clearly err in 
determining that Mother was not able to provide a safe home for Children within a reasonable period of time because this determination was supported by substantial evidence. See In re 
Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001). A parent must 
be both willing and able to provide a safe family home his or her child. See HRS § 587-73(a) (2006); HRS § 587A-33(a) (Supp. 
2010). Because we conclude that the Family Court did not err in determining that Mother was not able to provide a safe family home, we need not address the issue of whether Mother was willing to provide a safe family home. 
3. The record shows that the DHS provided Mother with
 
a reasonable opportunity to reunite with Children. The DHS
 asserts that after objecting to the service plan on September 21,
 
2/ Effective September 1, 2010, HRS Chapter 587 was repealed and the
Child Protective Act was reenacted with amendments and codified as HRS Chapter
587A. 2010 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 135. For purposes of our analysis, the
pertinent provisions of HRS Chapter 587 and HRS Chapter 587A are substantively
similar.

2009, Mother did not contest the service plan or request 
additional services from the DHS at subsequent hearings. Mother does not provide information which contradicts this assertion. Mother's inability to provide Children with a safe family home does not mean that the service plan was deficient or that the DHS failed to provide Mother with a reasonable opportunity to reunite with Children. Moreover, regardless of the degree to which Mother was compliant with her service plan, compliance with the service plan is not dispositive of whether Mother was able to provide a safe family home. See In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i at 193, 20 
P.3d at 626; HRS § 587-25 (2006); HRS § 587-25 (2006); HRS § 587A-7 (Supp. 2010).
