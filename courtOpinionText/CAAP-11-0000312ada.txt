NAKAMURA, C.J., FOLEY AND REIFURTH, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Catina Louise Beam, now known as
 
Catina L. Stefanik, (Stefanik) appeals from the "Order Denying
 
Motion to Vacate Order of October 13, 2009" (Order) filed on
 
March 2, 2011 and the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
Order" (FOFs/COLs/Order) filed on May 4, 2011 in the Family Court
 
1
of the First Circuit  (family court).  In its Order, the family
 
court denied Stefanik's "Motion to Vacate Order of October 13,
 
2009" (Motion to Vacate) "based upon lack of jurisdiction which

resides [with] the court in Louisiana" and in its
 
FOFs/COLs/Order, the court dismissed the motion.
 
On appeal, Stefanik contends the family court erred
 
when it dismissed her Motion to Vacate for lack of jurisdiction.

On February 23, 2007, the family court  entered the
"Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody"
 
(Divorce Decree), dissolving the marriage between Stefanik and
 
Defendant-Appellee Bruce Woodford Beam (Beam). The family court
 
(1)
 awarded Stefanik and Beam joint legal custody of their two
 
children (the Children), (2) awarded Stefanik physical custody of
 
the Children, subject to Beam's rights of reasonable visitation,
 
(3) awarded monthly child support of $1,520 and temporary monthly
 
spousal support of $2,500 to Stefanik, and (4) divided and
 
distributed Stefanik's and Beam's property and debts.
 
On August 1, 2008, Beam filed a post-decree motion
 
(Custody Motion) for the family court to award him temporary sole
 
legal and physical custody of the Children. Pursuant to family
 
3
court orders entered August 25, 2008 and October 24, 2008,  the
family court awarded temporary sole legal and physical custody of
 
the Children to Beam and limited Stefanik to supervised visits. 
The family court suspended child support payments to Stefanik and
 
ordered her to refund any child support payments received for the
 
second half of August 2008 and for any months thereafter.
 
On July 27, 2009, Stefanik filed a post-decree motion
 
for unsupervised visitation (Visitation Motion).

On September 14 and 15, 2009, the family court  heard
the two motions. On October 13, 2009, the family court entered
 
its "Order Re: 1) [Beam's] Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree

Relief, filed on August 1, 2008; and 2) [Stefanik's] Motion for
 
Unsupervised Visitation, filed on July 27, 2009" (October 13,
 
2009 Order). The family court awarded Beam sole physical custody
 
of the Children, awarded Beam and Stefanik joint legal custody of
 
the Children, and granted Stefanik's request for unsupervised
 
visitation.
 
Stefanik filed a notice of appeal from the October 13,
 
2009 Order. On November 15, 2010, this court entered a
 
5
Memorandum Opinion in No. 30169  affirming the October 13, 2009
Order. Beam v. Beam, No. 30169, 2010 WL 4609356 (App. Nov. 15,
 
2010) (mem).
 
On December 21, 2010, Beam and Stefanik, by mutual
 
consent, submitted to the jurisdiction of the State of
 Louisiana.
6 The 22nd Judicial District Court for the Parish of
 

St. Tammany7 (Louisiana Court), in Case No. 2009-17379, entered a
8
Consent Judgment, which modified  the October 13, 2009 Order. 
The Louisiana court granted joint legal custody of the Children
 
to Stefanik and Beam and awarded Stefanik physical custody, with
 
reasonable visitation rights for Beam. 
The Louisiana court
 
"further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that as long as one party
 resides in Louisiana, [the Louisiana Court] shall retain
 
exclusive jurisdiction regarding the custody and support of the
 
[C]hildren."
 
On January 19, 2011, in Hawai' i, Stefanik filed the 
Motion to Vacate. 
Stefanik argued that the Louisiana Consent

 (Foley and Ginoza, JJ.; Nakamura, C.J., dissenting separately).
 
6
 Over the course of the various legal proceedings, Stefanik, Beam, and
the Children moved from Hawai' i. At the time Stefanik and Beam entered into 
the Consent Judgment, Beam and the Children had lived in Louisiana since
April 15, 2009 and Stefanik had lived on the mainland United States sinceMarch 3, 2007.

 The Honorable Mary C. Devereaux presided.

 "'Modification' means a child-custody determination that changes,
replaces, supersedes, or is otherwise made after a previous determination
concerning the same child, whether or not it is made by the court that made
the previous determination." HRS § 583A-102 (2006 Repl.).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Judgment rendered the October 13, 2009 Order "void" and
 
"erroneous" and, as such, she should not be required to pay child
 
support due for the period from October 13, 2009 until the return
 
of the Children to her on December 21, 2010.
 
On March 2, 2011, the family court denied Stefanik's
 
Motion to Vacate for lack of jurisdiction. On May 4, 2011, the
 
family court entered its FOFs/COLs/Order, dismissing Stefanik's
 
motion. In its Conclusions of Law, the family court concluded it
 
lacked jurisdiction to hear this case:
 
2.	 Pursuant to the Louisiana [Consent Judgment],
Louisiana courts took exclusive jurisdiction over
issues pertaining to the custody and support of the
[C]hildren with the consent of both [Stefanik] and
[Beam]. The Louisiana courts had exclusive
jurisdiction over issues pertaining to the custody and
support of the [C]hildren at the time of the filing
and hearing on the Motion to Vacate.
 
3.	 This court is without jurisdiction to grant [Stefanik]
the relief sought by the Motion to Vacate and, as long
as either party resides in Louisiana, any further
relief must be obtained from the courts in Louisiana.
 
Stefanik timely appealed.
 
II.
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing a
case where the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not
on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit court
without subject matter jurisdiction is void.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, July 25­
August 1, 1997, and enacted by the Hawai' i Legislature in 2002 as 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 583A.10 When a Hawai' i 
court properly asserts jurisdiction and makes an initial child 
custody determination,11 that court retains "exclusive, 
continuing jurisdiction over the determination." HRS § 583A-202 (2006 Repl.). The court's exclusive jurisdiction continues until 
one of two events occurs: 
(1)	 A court of this State determines that the child, the
child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do
not have a significant connection with this State and
that substantial evidence is no longer available in
this State concerning the child's care, protection,
training, and personal relationships; or
 
(2)	 A court of this State or a court of another state
 determines that the child, the child's parents, and
any person acting as a parent do not presently reside
in this State.
 
12
HRS § 583A-202(a)  (emphasis added).
The family court properly asserted initial jurisdiction 
when it issued the February 23, 2007 Divorce Decree and made its 
child custody determination, awarding physical custody of the 
Children to Stefanik. 
At the time the parties commenced divorce 
proceedings, they resided in Hawai' i. 
10
 Pursuant to Act 124, effective January 1, 2003, HRS Chapter 583,
Hawai'i's Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act of 1968, was repealed and
replaced by HRS Chapter 583A, Hawai' i's Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and
Enforcement Act of 1997. 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 124, §§ 1 & 2 at 335-48.
11
 HRS § 583A-201 (2006 Repl.) provides, in relevant part:
 
§583A-201 Initial child-custody jurisdiction.  (a) Except
as otherwise provided in section 583A-204, a court of this State
has jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination
only if:
 
(1)	 This State is the home state of the child on the date
 of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home
state of the child within six months before the
 commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent
from this State but a parent or person acting as a
parent continues to live in this State[.]
12
 The language in HRS § 583A-202(a)(1) & (2) tracks the language in
UCCJEA § 202.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The family court's jurisdiction did not automatically
 
end once Stefanik, Beam, and the Children moved out of state. In
 
re Lewin, 149 S.W.3d 727, 736 (Tex. Ct. App. 2004) ("A court's
 
exclusive continuing jurisdiction does not vanish immediately
 
once all the parties leave the state."). As explained in
 
section 2 of the Comment to § 202 of the UCCJEA:
 
Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a
 
proceeding. If State A had jurisdiction under this section
at the time a modification proceeding was commenced there,
it would not be lost by all parties moving out of the State
prior to the conclusion of proceeding. State B would not
 have jurisdiction to hear a modification unless State A
decided that State B was more appropriate under Section 207.
 
(Emphasis added.) Jurisdiction remains with the home state until
 
the home state or another state determines that the exclusive
 
continuing jurisdiction of the home state has ended. UCCJEA
 
§ 202; HRS § 583A-202; State of New Mexico ex rel. Children,
 
Youth & Families Dep't v. Donna J., 129 P.3d 167, 171 (N.M. Ct.
 
App. 2006) ("[T]he UCCJEA language specifically requires action
 
by either the home or another state before exclusive, continuing
 
jurisdiction in the home state ceases."). Section 2 of the
 
Comment explains in relevant part:
 
If the child, the parents, and all persons acting as
parents have all left the State which made the custody
determination prior to the commencement of the modification
proceeding, considerations of waste of resources dictate
that a court in State B, as well as a court in State A, can
decide that State A has lost exclusive, continuing
jurisdiction.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The family court retained exclusive and continuing 
jurisdiction after the parties moved away from Hawai' i because 
the child custody modification proceeding initiated by Beam's 
Custody Motion was still pending. See Beam v. Beam, supra. The 
October 13, 2009 Order and this court's subsequent November 15, 2010 Memorandum Opinion affirming the October 13, 2009 Order 
ended all modification proceedings. 
In December 2010, in Louisiana, Stefanik and Beam
 
initiated proceedings to modify the October 13, 2009 Order. On

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
December 21, 2010, the Louisiana Court modified the October 13,
 
2009 Order regarding child custody. Both parties consented to
 
the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Court. According to the
 
Consent Judgment, Stefanik lived in Alabama and Beam lived in
 
Louisiana. The Louisiana court determined it had exclusive
 
jurisdiction regarding custody and support of the Children and
 
its jurisdiction would continue "as long as one party resides in
 
Louisiana."13
 
In its FOFs/COLs/Order, the family court correctly 
concluded that Hawai' i no longer had exclusive, continuing 
jurisdiction because Louisiana "took exclusive jurisdiction over issues pertaining to the custody and support of the [C]hildren 
with the consent of both [Stefanik] and [Beam]." Because Hawai' i 
no longer had jurisdiction, the family court had no authority to modify the October 13, 2009 Order.

The "Order Denying Motion to Vacate Order of
 
October 13, 2009" filed on March 2, 2011 and the "Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order" filed on May 4, 2011 in the
 
Family Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
