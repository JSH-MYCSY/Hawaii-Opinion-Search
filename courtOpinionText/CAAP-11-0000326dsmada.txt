APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-2272)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant/Counterclaim-
Plaintiff/Appellant Narcisco H. Yu, Jr. (Appellant), has asserted
 from the following two orders that the Honorable Patrick W.
 Border entered: (1) the March 31, 2011 order granting

Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Reynold Masatomi 
Hirazumi's motion for summary judgment ("the March 31, 2011 summary judgment order") and (2) the March 31, 2011 order granting Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant Reynold Masatomi Hirazumi's motion to dismiss Appellant's counterclaim ("the March 31, 2011 dismissal order"). The circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in this case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has promulgated HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. The 
separate judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an order that is not 
reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. 
at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and 
Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) 
(citation omitted; emphasis added). For example, the supreme court has explained that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set

forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii 
Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) 
(emphases added). 
Neither the March 31, 2011 summary judgment order nor
 
the March 31, 2011 dismissal order is a judgment; instead, each
 
is an interlocutory order. On May 27, 2011, the record on appeal
 for Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000326 was filed, at which time the
 record on appeal did not contain a separate judgment that
 resolves all claims in this case. Absent a separate, appealable
 judgment, Appellant's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000326 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
