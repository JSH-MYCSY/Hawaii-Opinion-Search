Nicholas W. Teves, Jr., in their official capacities as members 
of LUC; Castle and Cooke Resorts, Inc. (CCR); County of Maui 
Planning Department (Maui County); and the State of Hawai' i 
Office of Planning (SOP) and against LSG. 
The issue before this court is whether the circuit
 
court erred when it dismissed LSG's appeal from the January 25,
 2010 LUC "Order Vacating 1996 Cease and Desist Order; Denying
 
Office of Planning's Revised Motion to Amend Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order Filed April 16, 1991;
 
and Granting Petitioner's Motion for Modification of Condition
 
10, with Modifications" (2010 Order) for lack of jurisdiction.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November 29, 1989, Lanai Resort Partners (LRP), the 
predecessor-in-interest to Lanai Company, Inc. (LCI) and CCR,
2 
petitioned LUC to amend the land use district boundary at Manele, on the island of Lana' i, from rural and agricultural districts to 
an urban district. CCR planned to develop an eighteen-hole golf course on the property in question. CCR proposed to irrigate the 
golf course "with non-potable water from sources other than 
potable water from the high level aquifer." LUC approved CCR's 
reclassification request, subject to a number of conditions, 
including Condition No. 10, the focus of this appeal. Condition 
No. 10 restricted the use of potable water from Lana' i's high 
level aquifer by stating: 
10. [CCR] shall not utilize the potable water from
the high-level groundwater aquifer for golf course
irrigation use, and shall instead develop and utilize only
alternative non-potable sources of water (e.g., brackish
water, reclaimed sewage effluent) for golf course irrigation
requirements.
 
2
 Lanai Company, Inc. (LCI) was the initial successor-in-interest to
Lanai Resort Partners (LRP). On December 31, 2000, LCI and CCR merged,leaving CCR as the surviving entity. For the sake of simplicity, LRP, LCI,and CCR will be referred to as CCR, the current operator of Lana' i's Manele 
golf course. Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai' i 296, 298 n.2, 97
P.3d 372, 374 n.2 (2004).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition, [CCR] shall comply with the requirements
imposed upon [CCR] by the State Commission on Water Resource
Management as outlined in the State Commission on Water
Resource Management's Resubmittal -- Petition for
Designating the Island of Lanai as a Water Management Area,
dated March 29, 1990.
 
CCR also proposed "to provide alternate sources of water for golf
 
course irrigation by developing the brackish water supply." In
 
the event CCR did not follow through on its commitment to comply
 
with the various conditions, Condition 20 provided that such
 
failure "may result in reclassification of the property to its
 
former land use classification."
 
On October 13, 1993, LUC issued an Order to Show Cause,
 
requiring CCR "to show cause why [the property in question]
 
should not revert to its former land use classification" because
 
LUC had reason to believe CCR was in violation of Condition No.
 
10 of the 1991 Order.
 
At issue was the meaning of the term "potable water." 
LUC noted that during the original proceedings to obtain the
 
reclassification of land, CCR had used the term "high level
 
aquifer" interchangeably with the term "potable." During the
 
Order to Show Cause hearings, CCR defined "potable" as defined in
 
the Maui County Code -- "water containing less than 250 milligram
 
per liter of chlorides." LUC found that "[t]he potability of any
 
water source does not depend on any particular level of chloride
 
concentration." LUC also found that CCR was taking steps "to
 
ensure that only brackish water from the high level aquifer [was]
 
being utilized" for irrigation water.
 
On May 17, 1996, after holding a number of hearings,
 
LUC issued its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 
Decision and Order" (1996 Order) on the Order to Show Cause. LUC
 
concluded that Condition No. 10 prohibited the use of any water Â­
-brackish or not, potable or not -- from the high-level aquifer
 
for irrigation of the golf course and ordered CCR to "immediately
 cease and desist any use of water from the high level aquifer for
 
golf course irrigation requirements."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
CCR appealed LUC's 1996 Order to the Circuit Court of
 
3
the Second Circuit  (second circuit court).  LCI, 105 Hawai' i at 
298, 97 P.3d at 374. On April 26, 1997, the second circuit court 
reversed the 1996 Order on the basis that LUC exceeded its 
authority in issuing a cease and desist order. Id. The second 
circuit court declined to disturb LUC's finding that CCR violated Condition No. 10 of the 1991 Order. Id. On appeal, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as premature because the second circuit court had not entered an appealable final 
judgment. Id. at 306, 97 P.3d at 382. 
On April 26, 1999, the second circuit court amended its 
earlier ruling, citing additional bases for reversing LUC's 1996 
Order, finding, inter alia, that "[t]he LUC's conclusion that 
[CCR] violated Condition No. 10 was arbitrary, capricious, and 
clearly erroneous." LCI, 105 Hawai' i at 306, 97 P.3d at 382. 
Judgment was entered in favor of CCR, Maui County, and SOP and against LUC. Id. 
LSG and LUC appealed to the Hawai' i Supreme Court. Id. 
On September 17, 2004, the supreme court affirmed the second 
circuit court's ruling that LUC had failed to specify a clear 
factual basis for its 1996 Order. The supreme court stated: 
Although Condition No. 10 seemingly mandates that
"only alternative non-potable sources of water" shall be
used, it does not on its face exclude as a source
"non-potable" water that may exist in the high level
aquifer. Condition 10 only precluded [CCR] from
"utiliz[ing] the potable water" from the high level aquifer;
it did not also prohibit the use of "non-potable water.
"Accordingly, it is not apparent that Condition 10 was meant
to exclude the use of "non-potable" water.
 
LCI, 105 Hawai' i at 310, 97 P.3d at 386. Thus, "[t]he plain 
language of Condition No. 10 does not prohibit [CCR] from using 
all water from the high level aquifer." Id. The supreme court 
further stated that even if LUC's intent had been to preclude CCR 
3
 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from using all water, not just potable water, from the high level
 
aquifer, "[t]he plain language of Condition No. 10 did not give
 
fair notice, or adequately express" that intent. Id. at 314, 97
 
P.3d at 390. 
The supreme court remanded the case "to the [second 
circuit] court with instructions that the court remand this case to LUC for clarification of its findings, or for further hearings 
if necessary, as to whether [CCR] used potable water from the 
high level aquifer, in violation of Condition No. 10." LCI, 105 
Hawai'i at 319, 97 P.3d at 395 (2004). See In re Water Use Permit 
Applications (Waiahole), 94 Hawai' i 97, 158, 9 P.3d 409, 470 
(2000) (remanding a matter to the agency for "proper resolution" where the agency had "not provided any findings or conclusions 
that would enable meaningful review of its decision"). 
In response to the supreme court's remand and directive 
for LUC to clarify its findings or conduct further hearings, if 
necessary, LUC held evidentiary hearings on June 7-8, 2006, to 
incorporate more recent data and the current Maui County 
policies. LCI, 105 Hawai' i at 319, 97 P.3d at 395. LUC admitted 
evidence; heard testimony from the public, the parties, and expert witnesses; and cross-examined some of the witnesses. 
Subsequent to the hearings, the parties entered into settlement 
discussions, which eventually broke down. 
In 2007, CCR and SOP filed separate motions seeking to
 
amend LUC's 1991 Order by modifying Condition No. 10. CCR also
 
sought to dissolve LUC's 1996 Order to the extent CCR had been
 
ordered to "immediately cease and desist any use of water from
 
the high level aquifer for golf course irrigation requirements." 
On January 8, 2010, LUC met to consider "[CCR's] Motion
 
for Modification of Condition No. 10 and Dissolution of 1996
 
Cease and Desist Order" (CCR's Motion) and "[SOP's] Revised
 
Motion to Amend Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Decision and Order Filed April 16, 1991" (SOP's Motion). After
 
taking testimony, LUC voted to vacate the 1996 Order, deny SOP's
 
5
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Motion, and grant CCR's Motion with modifications. On January
 
25, 2010, LUC entered the 2010 Order.
 
On February 24, 2010, LSG filed its notice of appeal
 
from the 2010 Order to the circuit court.
 
The circuit court heard the appeal on November 23,
 
2010, and issued its Final Judgment on March 9, 2011. The
 
circuit court concluded it did not have jurisdiction to hear the
 
appeal, based on the premise that when the case was remanded to
 
LUC, the circuit courts were divested of further jurisdiction
 
over the matter. LSG timely appealed the Final Judgment to this 
court. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.
The standard of review is one in which [the appellate] court
must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong
in its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS
Â§ 91-14(g) (1993) to the agency's decision.
 
HRS Â§ 91-14, entitled "Judicial review of contested
cases," provides in relevant part: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
Under HRS Â§ 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewable
under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding
procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of fact
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion
under subsection (6).
 
United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, v. Hanneman, 106 
Hawai'i 359, 363, 105 P.3d 236, 240 (2005) (brackets in original 
omitted) (quoting Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai' i 
412, 416, 91 P.3d 494, 498 (2004)). "Pursuant to HRS Â§ 91-14(g), 
an agency's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo." United 
Pub. Workers, 106 Hawai' i at 363, 105 P.3d at 240 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). "A circuit court's 
conclusions of law are subject to de novo review." Paul's Elec. 
Serv., 104 Hawai' i at 420, 91 P.3d at 502. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The circuit court has jurisdiction over this appeal
 
pursuant to HRS Â§ 91-14 (1993 & Supp. 2011), which provides in
 
pertinent part:
 
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order
in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature
that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final
decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief is
entitled to judicial review under this chapter[.]
 
HRS Â§ 91-14(a).
 
Furthermore, the circuit court's review of LUC's 2010
 
Order is governed by HRS Â§ 91-14(g), which provides that the
 
court may reverse or modify an agency decision if the
 
petitioners' substantial rights may have been prejudiced because
 
the agency's findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction
of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion.
 
HRS Â§ 91-14(g).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On appeal to the circuit court, LSG contended LUC 
failed to follow the mandate set forth by the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court in that: 
81. The LUC erred by ignoring the very specific
instruction from the Hawai' i Supreme Court to render a
determination on whether [CCR] was using potable water from
the high level aquifer. 
82. The LUC made no finding whether CCR was in fact
using potable water from the high level aquifer in violation
of Condition No. 10, as the Hawai' i Supreme Court specified . 
LSG asked the circuit court to "[r]everse and vacate
 
the [2010] Order and declare that it is null and void because it
 
is arbitrary, capricious, characterized by abuse of discretion or
 
clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion, clearly erroneous,
 
made after following unlawful procedure and other error of
 
law[.]" In other words, LSG argued that LUC's 2010 Order
 
prejudiced LSG's substantial rights, in violation of HRS 91Â­
14(g).
 
The circuit court mistakenly believed it was divested 
of jurisdiction due to the instructions contained in the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court's remand in LCI, 105 Hawai' i 296, 97 P.3d 372. The 
supreme court directed the circuit court to "remand this case to 
the LUC for clarification of its findings, or for further 
hearings if necessary[.]" Id. at 319, 97 P.3d at 395. At that 
point in the proceedings, the circuit court was limited to take no action other than to remand the case to LUC. "When a 
reviewing court remands a matter with specific instructions, the 
trial court is powerless to undertake any proceedings beyond 
those specified therein." Standard Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 99 
Hawai'i 125, 137, 53 P.3d 264, 276 (App. 2001) (quoting Foster v. 
Civil Serv. Comm'n, 627 N.E.2d 285, 290 (Ill. App. 1993) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
Pursuant to HRS Â§ 91-14, the circuit court had
 
jurisdiction to hear LSG's appeal.
