APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-0936-05)
  
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this appeal arising out of a commercial arbitration,
 
Plaintiff-Appellant SS&M Auto Parts, LLC (SS&M) appeals from
 
orders and a Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (circuit court)  on March 10, 2011, that inter alia
 confirmed a Final Arbitration Award (Arbitration Award) dated
 April 28, 2010, as clarified by an "Order Granting in Part
 Respondent Sand Island Business Association's Motion For
 Clarification, Modification and/or Correction of Final
 Arbitration Award" (Arbitrator's Clarifying Order) issued on May

 The Honorable Patrick W. Border presiding .
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
19, 2010. The Arbitration Award and Arbitrator's Clarifying
 
Order are referred to collectively as "Arbitration Decision."
 
On appeal, SS&M contends that (1) the arbitrator failed
 
to decide what was submitted to him and thus the Arbitration
 Decision was incomplete; (2) the arbitrator decided what was not
 submitted to him and exceeded the scope of his authority; and (3)
 the Arbitration Decision as it relates to a rent trust fund was
 not confirmable.
 
SS&M's appeal in essence challenges the circuit court's
 
confirmation of the Arbitration Decision in favor of Defendant-
Appellee Sand Island Business Association (SIBA). In the circuit
 court, SS&M had sought to vacate the Arbitration Decision
 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-23 (Supp. 2012).
 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.
 
I. Background
 
SIBA holds a Master Lease for Sand Island Industrial
 
Park (Industrial Park). In 1993, SIBA subleased a portion of the
 Industrial Park, known as Lot No. 44 (Lot 44), to Island
 Softworks, Inc. (Island Softworks), now dissolved, represented by
 owner Defendant-Appellee Michael Chock (Chock).  Six years later,
 
in 1999, Chock and William Mahas (Mahas), who apparently
 
controlled SS&M at the time, entered into an agreement to assign
 the sublease of Lot 44 to SS&M, which was subject to SIBA's
 approval. Chock granted SS&M possession of Lot No. 44. However,
 
the sale and transfer of the sublease failed to be executed,
 
apparently due to SIBA withholding consent because of concerns
 that SS&M was controlled by Mahas.
 
In 2000, SIBA filed suit against Island Softworks and
 
Chock, seeking to terminate the sublease and to divest Island
 Softworks, Chock and any other person or entity claiming through
 them of all interest in Lot 44 (2000 Lawsuit). Although SS&M was
 not named as a party to the 2000 Lawsuit, the complaint
 identified as doe defendants any persons or entities to whom
 Island Softworks and/or Chock had conveyed interests in Lot 44.
 
In order to resolve the 2000 Lawsuit, SIBA, Island

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Softworks/Chock and SS&M entered into a Settlement Agreement
 
dated December 19, 2002. The Settlement Agreement provided inter
 alia that Chock agreed to sell the sublease to SS&M with closing
 of the sale to occur within a specified time period, that SIBA
 agreed to provide written consent to the assignment within a
 specified time period, and that SS&M agreed to various covenants
 related to its ownership and management, its operations at the
 Industrial Park, and its procurement of pollution liability
 insurance. The Settlement Agreement also provided for mutual
 releases among the parties from and against all claims "of any
 kind relating to the [2000] Lawsuit or any compulsory
 counterclaim[.]" The Settlement Agreement contained a broadly
 worded arbitration clause requiring that "[a]ny and all claims,
 controversies, or disputes arising out of or relating to this
 Settlement Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be fully and
 finally resolved by arbitration[.]"
 
Subsequently, the parties did not execute the sale of
 
the sublease. In 2005, SS&M filed suit against SIBA, Island
 Works and Chock seeking transfer of the sublease and claiming
 breach of the Settlement Agreement, fraud, unfair and deceptive
 business practices, bad faith, and requesting declaratory
 judgment vacating a prior arbitration award (2005 Lawsuit).

In November 2007, SS&M issued a demand for arbitration
 
pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Settlement Agreement. 
This arbitration proceeding was designated DPR No. 07-0509-A and
 hearings were subsequently held in December 2009. The
 Arbitration Award was issued on April 28, 2010 and the
 Arbitrator's Clarifying Order was issued on May 19, 2010.
 
On June 16, 2010, SIBA filed a motion to confirm the

that two other arbitration proceedings were held prior to the
arbitration proceedings involved in this appeal. The issues in
 this appeal do not relate to the prior arbitration proceedings,
but rather only those proceedings identified as DPR No. 07-0509­A.
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Arbitration Decision, to which SS&M filed an opposition on August
 
3, 2010. On August 12, 2010, SS&M filed its motion to vacate the
 
Arbitration Decision pursuant to HRS § 658A-23, and on August 30,
 
2010, SS&M filed a supplemental memorandum also based on HRS §
 
658A-23.
 
On March 10, 2011, the circuit court denied SS&M's
 
motion to vacate and granted SIBA's motion to confirm the
 Arbitration Decision. On the same date, the circuit court also
 entered Judgment pursuant to the Arbitration Decision awarding
 inter alia possession of Lot 44 to SIBA, quantum meruit damages
 to SIBA from SS&M for loss of certain rental revenue during
 SS&M's occupation of Lot 44 (to be paid in part by funds
 deposited by SS&M in a rent trust fund previously established by
 the circuit court), and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to
 SIBA. SS&M timely appealed.
II. Standard of Review
 
"We review the circuit court's ruling on an arbitration 
award de novo, but we also are mindful that the circuit court's review of arbitral awards must be extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai' i 
226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002)(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). 
III. Discussion
 
A. Incompleteness of the Arbitration Decision
 
SS&M's first contention is that the Arbitration
 
Decision should not have been confirmed because it was
 incomplete, arguing that it failed "to address the major material
 issue presented for adjudication, mostly and importantly the
 basic interpretation of the terms and conditions of the
 Settlement Agreement that distinguish and impose a two-tier level
 of responsibilities and performances upon the parties[.]" We
 find no merit in SS&M's argument.
 
Moreover, and significantly, SS&M's motion before the
 
circuit court only sought to vacate the Arbitration Decision
 pursuant to HRS § 658A-23. "[A]n arbitration award can be
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
vacated only on the six grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23(a)[.]" 
Kona Vill. Realty, Inc. v. Sunstone Realty Partners, XIV, LLC, 121 Hawai' i 110, 113, 214 P.3d 1100, 1103 (App. 2009), aff'd 123 
Hawai'i 476, 236 P.3d 456 (2010). Incompleteness is not one of 
the six enumerated grounds for vacating an arbitration award under HRS § 658A-23(a).

B. The Arbitrator Did Not Exceed His Authority
 
"The scope of an arbitrator's authority is determined 
by agreement of the parties. An arbitrator must act within the scope of the authority conferred upon him by the parties and cannot exceed his power by deciding matters not submitted." Clawson v. Habilitat, Inc., 71 Haw. 76, 78, 783 P.2d 1230, 1231 (1989). "The scope of an arbitration panel's authority is determined by the relevant agreement to arbitrate." Kona Vill. 
Realty, 121 Hawai' i at 113, 214 P.2d at 1103 (citing Hamada v. 
Westcott, 102 Hawai' i 210, 214, 74 P.3d 33, 37 (2003)). "Under 
Hawai‘i law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration." County of Hawai' i 
v. UNIDEV, LLC, 129 Hawai' i 378, 394, 301 P.3d 588, 604 (2013) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"Judicial review is limited to cases in which the 
arbitrators manifestly exceed the agreement between the parties." Tatibouet, 99 Hawai' i at 234, 54 P.3d at 405 (emphasis added). 
An appellate court must determine if the arbitration award "draws its essence" from the arbitration agreement by looking "to the arbitration clause, the words of the contract, and the conduct of the parties." United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu Holiday Pay, No. 29710, 2011 WL 2696394, at *6 (App. July 12, 2011)(internal quotation marks omitted). 
"The burden of establishing grounds for vacating an
 
3
 Even assuming a party can ask a court to submit a claim
back to the arbitrator to modify or correct an arbitration award
that is not final and definite, see HRS § 658A-20(d), SS&M made
no such request to the circuit court. Rather, SS&M only sought
to vacate the award under HRS § 658A-23.
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arbitration award is on the party seeking it." See Ashley v. 
Hart, No. 28207, 125 Hawai' i 242, 257 P.3d 1219 (App. Feb. 25, 
2011) (mem.) (quoting United States Life Ins. Co. v. Superior 
Nat. Ins. Co., 591 F.3d 1167, 1173 (9th Cir. 2010)). 
As best as can be discerned from its appellate briefs,
 
SS&M asserts that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his
 authority by making decisions on five issues: (1) requiring SS&M 
to pay rent to SIBA, which the arbitrator did on a quantum meruit
 basis; (2) dismissing Chock from the proceedings; (3) deeming
 SIBA's conduct reasonable; (4) awarding SIBA reasonable costs to
 remediate Lot 44; and (5) awarding SIBA attorney's fees and
 costs.
 
1. Liability of the Parties
 
The first four issues relate to the liability of the 
parties regarding Lot 44 and the long-standing dispute between the parties. The broadly worded arbitration clause in the Settlement Agreement provides for arbitration of "[a]ny and all claims, controversies, or disputes arising out of or relating to this Settlement Agreement, or the breach thereof[.]" The 
Settlement Agreement was entered to resolve all disputes relating 
to SIBA's 2000 Lawsuit against Island Softworks/Chock, in which SIBA sought to terminate the sublease and to divest Island Softworks/Chock and any party claiming through them of any interest in Lot 44. As specifically acknowledged in the Settlement Agreement, Chock and SS&M had entered into an agreement in April 1999 for SS&M to purchase the sublease. Thus, all of the disputes between SIBA, Island Softworks, Chock and SS&M regarding Lot 44 "arise out of" or "relate to" the Settlement Agreement. See UNIDEV, 129 Hawai' i at 395-96, 301 
P.3d at 605-606 (holding that arbitration clauses providing for arbitration of any dispute "arising under" or "arising out of" an agreement should be construed broadly). Additionally, the arbitration clause provides for arbitration of any claim or dispute arising out of or related to the "breach" of the Settlement Agreement. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In sum, the long-standing dispute between the parties
 
was based on the attempt by Chock to assign the sublease to SS&M,
 
which the parties sought to effect by way of the Settlement
 Agreement. Although assignment of the sublease was never
 completed, SS&M apparently had possession of Lot 44 for many
 years. Thus, the issues of SS&M's liability for payments to SIBA
 based on SS&M's possession of Lot 44, Chock's liability, whether
 or not SIBA's conduct was reasonable, and SS&M's obligation to
 pay reasonable costs to remediate the property are all issues
 arising out of or relating to the Settlement Agreement.
2. Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
The award of attorneys' fees and costs are clearly
 
within the scope of the arbitrator's authority. HRS § 658A-21(b)
 (Supp. 2012) provides two bases for the award of attorneys' fees
 in arbitration proceedings: "[a]n arbitrator may award
 reasonable attorney's fees and other reasonable expenses of
 arbitration if such an award is authorized by law in a civil
 action involving the same claim or by the agreement of the
 parties to the arbitration proceeding." (Emphasis added).
 
The parties clearly agreed that the non-prevailing
 
party would be responsible for attorneys' fees and costs of the
 prevailing party. The arbitration clause explicitly states, 
"[t]he non-prevailing party shall pay the attorneys' fees and
 costs of the prevailing party." Thus, the parties' agreement
 empowered the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs under
 HRS § 658A-21(b). According to the Arbitration Award, SIBA was
 the prevailing party. Thus, the arbitrator did not exceed his
 authority by awarding SIBA attorneys' fees and costs.
C. Confirmation as to Rent Trust Fund
 
SS&M's final contention is that the Arbitration
 
Decision as it relates to the rent trust fund was not
 confirmable, apparently arguing that affecting the rent trust
 fund exceeded the arbitrator's authority. In this regard, SS&M
 essentially argues that because the arbitrator ultimately
 determined that SS&M was not in a landlord-tenant relationship
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with SIBA, and the circuit court had established the rent trust
 
fund based on SS&M's claims to be a tenant, SIBA is not entitled
 to the monies in the rent trust fund.
 
[B]ecause of the legislative policy to encourage arbitration
and thereby discourage litigation, arbitrators have broad
discretion in resolving the dispute. Upon submission of an
issue, the arbitrator has authority to determine the entire
question, including the legal construction of terms of a
contract or lease, as well as the disputed facts. In fact,
where the parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby assume
all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the
risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the
application of law and in their findings of fact.
 
Schmidt v. Pac. Benefit Servs., Inc., 113 Hawai‘i 161, 165, 150
 
P.3d 810, 814 (2006) (quoting Daiichi Hawai‘i Real Estate Corp.
 v. Lichter, 103 Hawai‘i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 411, 422
 (2003))(emphasis added). Although the issue is not clear, even
 if we were to assume (without deciding) that it was contrary to
 law that the rent trust fund be used to pay quantum meruit
 damages, it would not be a basis to vacate the Arbitration
 Decision.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the order confirming the
 
Arbitration Decision and the Judgment entered in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit on March 10, 2011 are affirmed.
