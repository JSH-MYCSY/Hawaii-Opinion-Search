SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Ricky L. Waiolama (Ricky) and Jan 
Waiolama (Jan) (collectively, the Waiolamas) appeal from a 
March 15, 2011 Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) 
Judgment in favor of the Waiolamas but awarding costs and 
attorneys' fees to Defendants-Appellees the State of Hawai 'i 
(State) and Ernest G. Darisay (Darisay) (collectively, the Defendants).
1 Following the Defendants' appeal from an 
arbitrator's award and request for trial de novo, the Circuit 
Court concluded that Ricky was twenty-five percent comparatively 
negligent in causing the collision with Darisay in light of its 
finding that Ricky was traveling at an excessive rate of speed 
prior to impact.

 The Honorable Patrick W. Border presided.

On appeal, the Waiolamas maintain that the Circuit
 
Court erred in (1) admitting the testimony of the State's expert
 
witness, Gerald Bretting (Bretting); (2) concluding that Ricky
 
was twenty-five percent comparatively negligent in causing the
 
collision; (3) awarding sanctions against them; and (4) denying
 
their request for attorneys' fees and costs while awarding the
 
State its costs.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the record on appeal, and legal
 
authorities, we resolve the Waiolama's points on appeal as
 
follows: 
1. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
admitting Bretting's testimony. "Whether expert testimony should 
be admitted at trial rests within the sound discretion of the 
trial court and will not be overturned unless there is a clear 
abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, to be admissible, expert 
testimony must be both relevant and reliable." Tabieros v. Clark 
Equip. Co., 85 Hawai 'i 336, 351, 944 P.2d 1279, 1294 (1997) 
(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We further 
note that "under HRE Rule 702, expert testimony should be 
liberally admitted at trial." Cochrane v. Azman, 125 Hawai 'i 
242, 257 P.3d 1219, No. 29562, 2011 WL 661714 at *4 (App. Feb. 22, 2011) (mem.) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
"The trial court's inquiry as to the relevancy 
requirement is whether the untrained layman would be qualified to 
determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the 
particular issue without enlightenment from those having a 
specialized understanding of the subject involved in the 
dispute." State v. Vliet, 95 Hawai
'i 94, 111, 19 P.3d 42, 59 
(2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The dispute concerning the timing of events leading to the collision 
"was a matter on which laypersons would be 'enlightened' by 
witnesses, such as [Bretting], who had 'specialized 
understanding' on such a subject." Id. Bretting's testimony was 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
relevant because his opinion as to the events leading to the
 
collision "would assist the trier of fact in determining a fact
 
in issue, that is, whether" Ricky was speeding and, hence,
 
comparatively negligent. Id. In addition, Bretting's ultimate
 
opinion that Ricky was speeding "was relevant under HRE Rule 702,
 admissible under HRE Rule 704, and permissible under HRE Rule
 
403." Vliet at 112, 19 P.3d at 60. Thus, the Circuit Court did
 
not err in treating Bretting's testimony as relevant.
 
A trial judge has broad latitude to decide whether 
particular expert testimony is reliable. Vliet, 95 Hawai
'i at 
110, 19 P.3d at 58. Bretting's opinion was "based upon facts in 
evidence" and not "mere speculation[.]" Tabieros, 85 Hawai 'i at 
391, 944 P.2d at 1334 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Bretting's opinions were reliable because they 
were based on generally accepted methodology and facts in 
evidence. Bretting used a software program called PC-Crash, 
which has been peer reviewed and generally accepted by the 
industry as an effective and reliable tool. There have also been 
numerous articles written on the accuracy of PC-Crash. 
Thus, we are unable to conclude that the Circuit Court
 
abused its discretion in ruling that Bretting's opinion that
 
Ricky was traveling at about fifty-five miles per hour was
 
reliable.
 
The Waiolamas make a number of other arguments against
 
admission of Bretting's testimony. Bretting's report, which
 
included his opinions about events leading up to the accident,
 
was turned over to the Waiolamas by the February 3, 2010 deadline
 
and was therefore timely. Although State's Exhibits S and T were
 
turned over to the Waiolamas after the discovery deadline, the
 
Circuit Court treated them as illustrations, as "both sides have
 
used them to their advantage in questioning the witness." We
 
decline to conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion
 
in allowing these illustrations to be admitted as demonstrative
 
evidence.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Waiolamas also argue that Bretting was not credible
 
based on the declaration of Darcianne Ernce. However, the
 
Circuit Court found Bretting to be a credible witness and
 
considered his testimony in its findings, agreeing that Ricky's
 
vehicle was traveling at between fifty and fifty-five miles per
 
hour. The trial judge, "as the trier of fact, is the sole judge
 
of the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence." 
State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637-38, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981). 
The judge had the opportunity to observe Bretting's demeanor and
 
hear his testimony first hand. Bretting testified that he has
 
reconstructed at least 2500 vehicle accidents, has been qualified
 
to testify as an accident reconstructionist about 200 to 300
 
times, and has been qualified to testify in roughly fifteen
 
states. We decline to disturb the Circuit Court's conclusion
 
that Bretting was credible.
 
2. The Circuit Court did not err in concluding that
 
Ricky was twenty-five percent negligent in causing the collision.
 
The Circuit Court's finding that Ricky was traveling "at or
 
around 55 miles per hour" was not clearly erroneous. The
 
Waiolamas offered no expert testimony to dispute Bretting's
 
estimate of speed. Rather, they argue that Bretting's and
 
Darisay's credibility is in question while Ricky Waiolama's and
 
Dul's credibility were not called into question, thereby making
 
the latters' accounts of the collision more trustworthy. They
 
also emphasize the fact that Bretting could not generate a PC-
Crash report that was consistent with the final resting place of
 
Darisay's truck and conclude there was no basis for his opinion
 
regarding the speed of Ricky's vehicle.
 
Again, the Circuit Court was the trier of fact and the
 
sole judge of witness credibility and weight of the evidence. 
Tamura, 63 Haw. at 637-38, 633 P.2d at 1117. We find no reason
 
to disturb his credibility judgment, as "[t]he trial judge has
 
the advantage . . . in receiving evidence first hand and weighing
 
it accordingly. We feel no compulsion to second guess the trier

of fact in this situation." Viveiros v. State, 54 Haw. 611, 614,
 
513 P.2d 487, 490 (1973). 
3. The Waiolamas argue, and the State concedes, that
 
the Circuit Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys'
 
fees and expert witness fees in favor of the State.
 
Hawai'i Arbitration Rules (HAR) Rule 26 provides that 
the trial court may impose sanctions, including expert witness 
fees and attorneys' fees, "against the non-prevailing party whose 
appeal resulted in the trial de novo." HAR Rule 26(A) (emphasis 
added) & Rule 26(B)(1), (3). The Rules "provide for sanctions 
against an appealing party, that is, a party dissatisfied with an 
arbitration award, who insists on pursuing a trial de novo but 
fails to improve the award." Kealoha v. Cnty. of Hawai 'i, 74 
Haw. 308, 326, 844 P.2d 670, 678-79 (1993). HAR Rule 26(A) 
clearly and unambiguously restricts "potential sanctions to non-
prevailing parties who appeal an arbitration award." Kealoha, 74 
Haw. at 326, 844 P.2d at 679 (emphasis added). Here, HAR Rule 26 
does not apply and sanctions cannot be imposed against the 
Waiolamas because they are not the party who appealed the 
arbitration award. Rather, Darisay and the State appealed from 
the arbitration award and requested a trial de novo. 
4. The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
awarding costs to the State. HAR Rule 25 provides:
 
(A) The "Prevailing Party" in a trial de novo is the
party who (1) appealed and improved upon the arbitration
award by 30% or more, or (2) did not appeal and the
appealing party failed to improve upon the arbitration award
by 30% or more. For the purpose of this rule, "improve" or
"improved" means to increase the award for a plaintiff or to
decrease the award for the defendant.
 
(B) The "Prevailing Party" under these rules, as
defined above, is deemed the prevailing party under any
statute or rule of court. As such, the prevailing party is
entitled to costs of trial and all other remedies as
 provided by law, unless the Court otherwise directs.
 
The State falls under HAR Rule 25(A)(1) and, according
 
to HAR Rule 25(B), may be awarded costs within the court's
 
discretion.

The Waiolamas are not the "prevailing party."2 The
 
Arbitrator awarded total damages in the amount of $129,250.20,
 
less ten percent for Ricky's comparative negligence, for a net
 
award amount of $116,325. Following trial, the Circuit Court
 
awarded Ricky a total of $66,188.96, less twenty-five percent for
 
Ricky's comparative negligence, for a net award amount of
 
$49,641.72. Jan was awarded $5,000, less twenty-five percent,
 
for a net award amount of $3,750. The Waiolamas were awarded
 
$18,061.24 for damage to property, less twenty-five percent, for
 
a net award of $13,545.93. Darisay and the State were awarded
 
costs in the amount of $19,336.90 and attorneys' fees in the
 
amount of $21,150, for a total amount of $40,486.90.
 
Under HAR Rule 25(A), the State is the "prevailing
 
party" because the net award amount was reduced from $116,325
 
following arbitration to $66,937.65 ($49,641.72 + $3,750 +
 
$13,545.93) following trial de novo. This resulted in a
 
reduction of over 42 percent of the arbitration award to the
 
Waiolamas (($116,325 - $66,937.65)/$116,325).
 
"HRCP Rule 54(d) is a general rule that allows the

 
award of costs to the prevailing party in a civil suit." Molinar
 
v. Schweizer, 95 Hawai 'i 331, 336, 22 P.3d 978, 983 (2001). HRCP 
Rule 54(d) provides, in relevant part, "Except when express 
provision therefor is made either in a statute or in these rules, 
costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party 
unless the court otherwise directs[.]" (Emphasis added.) "By 
the plain language of HRCP Rule 54(d) . . . , the trial court's 
ability to award costs may be circumscribed by a statute or rule 
of court." Molinar at 336, 22 P.3d at 983. 
2
 The Waiolamas argue that the "prevailing party" cannot be
determined because the CAAP arbitrator did not make separate awards to Ricky
and Jan. However, we consider the total amount awarded to the Waiolamas,
collectively, as the plaintiffs, in determining whether the plaintiffs or
defendants are the "prevailing party." Moreover, pursuant to HAR Rule 25(B),
the trial court has discretion to award costs to the non-prevailing party if
it is equitable. HAR Rule 25 cmt. (1999).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Molinar, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court explained that, 
in the context of HAR Rule 25, "[a]lthough Molinar may have 
'prevailed' in the traditional sense that she was awarded 
compensation from Schweizer at trial, she is not the prevailing 
party according to the rules of court because HAR Rule 25 
supersedes any common law 'prevailing party' determination." 
Molinar, 95 Hawai 'i at 337, 22 P.3d at 984 (quoting HAR Rule 25). 
As in Molinar, the Waiolamas' claim that they are entitled to an award of costs and attorneys' fees under HRCP Rule 54(d) as the 
prevailing party is foreclosed. In light of the factors listed 
3
in the commentary to HAR Rule 25,  we cannot conclude that the
Circuit Court's award of costs and fees was an abuse of

 
discretion. See
 HAR Rule 25 cmt. (1999). 
Finally, citing to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 662­
4
12 (1993),  the Waiolamas urge us to find that they are entitled
to attorneys' fees because "the State required [them] to fully

 
litigate this matter" and "vigorously contested" the case. We
 disagree.
 
The award of attorneys' fees under the State Tort

 
Liability Act is discretionary with the trial court. Viveiros,
 
3
 The commentary provides, in relevant part:
 
The July 1, 1999 amendment makes clear that the
allowance of costs to the prevailing party is not mandatory.
The amendment is intended to vest the trial court with
 discretion in awarding taxable costs to avoid inequitable
results. In weighing the equities, the trial court may
consider factors such as the nature of the case, the conduct
of the parties throughout the litigation, including
arbitration proceedings, the amount and timing of settlement
offers made by the parties, the amount of the judgment, and
other relevant factors.

 §662-12 Attorney's fees.  The court rendering a judgment
for the plaintiff pursuant to this chapter or the attorney general
making a disposition pursuant to section 662-11 may, as a part of
such judgment, award, or settlement, determine and allow
reasonable attorney's fees which shall not, however, exceed
twenty-five per cent of the amount recovered and shall be payable
out of the judgment awarded to the plaintiff; provided that such
limitation shall not include attorney's fees and costs that the
court may award the plaintiff as a matter of its sanctions.
 
(Emphasis added.)

54 Haw. at 614, 513 P.2d at 489-90 (1973). Here, as in

Viveiros,  "[s]ince we view HRS § 662-12 as a statute that gives
the trial court discretion in awarding attorney's fees, we must
 
necessarily sustain the denial of such allowance." Viveiros, 54
 
Haw. at 614, 513 P.2d at 490.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the March 15, 2011
 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit to the
 extent that it imposes sanctions against the Waiolamas. In all
 
other respects, we affirm.
