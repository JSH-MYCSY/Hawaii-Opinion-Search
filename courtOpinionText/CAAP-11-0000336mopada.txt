the "Order Granting Defendant Marriott Hotel Service's, Inc. dba

20, 2009, Filed on April 26, 2010, Filed on July 13, 2010" filed
 
March 9, 2011.
 
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred
 
in granting summary judgment by:
 
(1) finding that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the
 
workers' compensation exclusive remedies provision, Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) HRS § 386-5 (1993);
 
(2) finding that Plaintiffs failed to establish that
 
Marriott had a duty to warn;
 
(3) failing to view all of the evidence and inferences
 
drawn in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs; and
 
(4) failing to consider Plaintiffs' claims of
 
Marriott's duty to control its employee.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises out of the death of Tito G. Rafol
 
(Rafol), an employee with Marriott. On March 8, 2007, Rafol was
 
walking to his vehicle after completing his work shift, when he
 
was shot numerous times with a semi-automatic pistol by Lito
 
Agmata Mateo (Mateo), another Marriott employee. Rafol died from
 
his wounds. It is undisputed that Mateo shot Rafol because of an
 
May 3, 2011 Judgment. However, Hawaif i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
Rule 4(a)(2) allows for premature appeals under these circumstances.

 The Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance presided .

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
extramarital affair between Rafol and Mateo's wife. It is also
 
undisputed that Marriott knew of the affair prior to the
 
shooting.
 
On May 9, 2007, Plaintiffs filed a Dependent's Claim 
for Compensation with the State of Hawaif i Department of Labor 
and Industrial Relations, Disability and Compensation Division 
(Disability and Compensation Division). On September 17, 2007, 
the Disability and Compensation Division denied the claim, 
stating that "[s]ince there is no work-connected motive for the 
shooting, it is determined that [Mateo's] willful act was due to 
a personal matter of unknown origin between the parties." 
Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against Marriott on March 
4, 2009. In response, Marriott filed a "Motion to Dismiss 
Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), HRCP" (Motion to Dismiss) on April 20, 
2009. Marriott argued that Plaintiffs' claims were barred from 
workers' compensation, or in the alternative, that Marriott could 
not be held liable for the conduct of Mateo. At a hearing on 
June 15, 2009, the circuit court converted the Motion to Dismiss 
to a Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Hawaif i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f). 
On April 26, 2010, the circuit court issued its "Order
 
Granting [Mariott's] Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed April 20,
 2009" and found that: 
1. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the worker's
compensation exclusive remedies. See [HRS] § 386-5, as
amended.
 
2. Even if Plaintiff's claims were not barred, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish that [Marriott]
had a duty to warn.
 
3. Furthermore, Plaintiff's punitive damages claim is
derivative of Plaintiff's substantial claim and therefore,
shall be dismissed.
 
On May 26, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a motion for
 
reconsideration, which the circuit court denied on July 7, 2010. 
Plaintiffs filed their appeal on April 7, 2011. The circuit
 
court entered its judgment in favor of Marriott on May 3, 2011.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de 
novo. See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and County of Honolulu, 99 Hawaif i 508, 
[515], 57 P.3d 433, [440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawaif i 
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The circuit court erred in ruling that Plaintiffs'
claims are barred by the workers' compensation
exclusive remedies provision of HRS § 386-5. 
Plaintiffs argue that circuit court erred in ruling
 
Plaintiffs' claims are barred from workers' compensation. Under
 
the exclusive remedies provision of Hawaif i Workers' Compensation 
Law: 
[t]he rights and remedies herein granted to an employee or
the employee's dependents on account of a work injury
suffered by the employee shall exclude all other liability
of the employer to the employee, the employee's legal
representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, or anyone
else entitled to recover damages from the employer, at
common law or otherwise[.]
 
HRS § 386-5. 
Plaintiffs contend the above stated exclusive remedies
 
provision does not apply to this case because Rafol's death is
 
not covered by workers' compensation. HRS § 386-3 (2011 Repl.)
 
governs injuries covered by workers' compensation.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
If an employee suffers personal injury either by accident
arising out of and in the course of the employment or by
disease proximately caused by or resulting from the nature
of the employment, the employee's employer or the special
compensation fund shall pay compensation to the employee or
the employee's dependents as provided in this chapter.
 
Accident arising out of and in the course of the
employment includes the wilful act of a third person
directed against an employee because of the employee's
employment.
 
HRS § 386-3(a) (emphasis added).
 
It is well settled that 
[f]or an injury to be compensable under a workers'compensation statute, there must be a requisite nexusbetween the employment and the injury. The nexus requirement is articulated in Hawaif i, as in the majority of
jurisdictions, on the basis that, to be compensable, aninjury must arise out of and in the course of employment. 
Zemis v. SCI Contractors, Inc., 80 Hawaif i 442, 445, 911 P.2d 77, 
80 (1996) (quoting Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co, 77 Hawaif i 100, 
103, 881 P.2d 1246, 1249 (1994)). "Under HRS § 386-3, where an 
employee is injured by the wilful act of a third person, a causal 
connection between the employment and the resulting injury may be 
found if the wilful act of the third person was 'directed against 
[the] employee because of the employee's employment.'" Zemis, 80 
Hawaifi at 446, 911 P.2d at 81. 
In Zemis, Charles Zemis, an employee with SCI
 
Contractors, was assaulted by fellow employee Michael Gangloff. 
The assault arose out of a dispute over a car accident between
 
Zemis and Gangloff's wife. Id. at 444, 911 P.2d at 79. The
 
court concluded that Zemis was "not entitled to workers'
 
compensation benefits because Zemis was not assaulted 'because of
 
[his] employment' and, therefore, the injuries he sustained as a
 
result of the assault by Gangloff did not arise out of and in the
 
course of his employment." Id. at 449, 911 P.2d at 84.
 
The instant case is analogous to Zemis. Here, Rafol's
 
death was caused by the intentional acts of a co-worker as a
 
result of a dispute over the extramarital affair between Rafol
 
and Mateo's wife. Nothing indicated that Rafol's killing was
 
related to his employment. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 386-3(a) allows workers' compensation for injuries from
 
willful acts of a third person directed against an employee
 
because of the employee's employment. Because Rafol's killing
 
was not due to his employment, this case is not covered by
 
workers' compensation, and as such, the exclusive remedies
 
provision does not apply. Therefore, the circuit court erred in
 
ruling that Plaintiffs' claims were barred by the exclusive
 
remedies provision. 
B.	 The circuit court did not err in ruling that
Plaintiffs failed to establish a duty to warn. 
Plaintiffs argue the circuit court erred in ruling that
 
Plaintiffs failed to establish that Marriott had a duty to warn. 
Plaintiffs contend Marriott's failure to follow its own workplace
 
violence policies had unreasonably created a condition of
 
employment that foreseeably enhanced the risk of criminal attack. 
However, Marriott contends that even if the circuit court erred
 
in ruling the exclusive remedies provision did not apply, the
 
error was harmless because Plaintiffs failed to establish a duty
 
to warn.
 
Under common law, an employer has a duty to exercise
 
reasonable care for the safety of employees:
 
[a] master is subject to a duty that care be used either to
provide working conditions which are reasonably safe for his
servants and subservants, considering the nature of the
employment, or to warn them of risks of unsafe conditions
which he should realize they may not discover by the
exercise of due care.
 
Haworth v. State, 60 Haw. 557, 560, 592 P.2d 820, 823 (1979)
 
(quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency § 492 (1958)). "[C]ourts
 
have generally declined to impose a duty to protect another
 
against the criminal acts of a third party." Doe v. Grosvenor
 
Properties (Hawaii) Ltd., 73 Haw. 158, 162, 829 P.2d 512, 516
 (1992). "Exceptions to the general rule that there is no duty to
 
protect may arise when justified by the existence of some special
 
relationship between the parties." Id. at 163, 829 P.2d at 516. 
Furthermore, a "principal is subject to liability in an action of
 tort for failing to use care to warn an agent of an unreasonable
 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
risk involved in the employment, if the principal should realize
 
that it exists and that the agent is likely not to become aware
 
of it, thereby suffering harm." Restatement (Second) of Agency §
 
471 (1958).
 
While an employee-employer relationship may give rise
 
to a duty to warn, "based on section 471 of the Restatement
 
(Second) of Agency, a duty for an employer to issue a warning to
 
an employee would arise only where the risk is (1) unreasonable,
 
(2) involved in the employment, (3) foreseeable, and (4) the
 
employee is not likely to become aware of it on his own." 
MacDonald v. Hinton, 836 N.E.2d 893, 899, 297 (Ill. App. 1 Dist.,
 
2005). Therefore, the danger must be "involved in the
 
employment" in order to invoke an employer's duty to warn. "[I]n
 
order for the risk to be 'involved in the employment,' it must
 
arise from the particular nature of the employment." Id. at 901.
 
In this case, the shooting of Rafol by Mateo did not
 
arise from Rafol's employment. Therefore, the circuit court did
 
not err in ruling that Plaintiffs failed to establish that
 
Marriott had a duty to warn. 
C.	 The circuit court did not err in not ruling that
Marriott had a duty to control Mateo.
 
Plaintiffs argue that Marriott had a duty to control
 
Mateo. In granting Marriott's motion for summary judgment, the
 
circuit court did not address the issue of Marriott's duty to
 
control.
 
A claim for negligent failure to control an employee
 
"may arise when the acts complained of are so connected in time
 
and place with the employment as to give the employer a special
 
opportunity to control the employee." Costa v. Able
 
Distributors, Inc., 3 Haw. App. 486, 490, 653 P.2d 101, 105
 (1982) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 317 (1965)). The
 
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 317 outlines the duty to control. 
A master is under a duty to exercise reasonable care
so to control his servant while acting outside the scope of
his employment as to prevent him from intentionally harming
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
others or from so conducting himself as to create an
unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them, if
 
(a) the servant
 
(i) is upon the premises in possession of
the master or upon which the servant is
privileged to enter only as his servant, or
 
(ii) is using a chattel of the master, and
 
(b) the master
 
(i) knows or has reason to know that he 
has the ability to control his servant, and
 
(ii) knows or should know of the necessity
and opportunity for exercising such control.
 
Thus, "[i]n order for the plaintiff to recover, he must show that
 
the employer knew or should have known of the necessity and
 
opportunity for exercising such control over the employee."
 
Costa, 3 Haw. App. at 490, 653 P.2d at 105 (1982).
 
Marriott contends "there is no evidence that Marriott 
knew or had any reason [to] know of any dangerous or violent 
propensities on the part of [Mateo]." The Hawaif i Supreme Court 
has held: 
"when an employer has no reasonable basis for knowing that
its employees are engaging in on-premises conduct . . .
which is outside the scope of their employment, in such a
way as to necessitate the exercise of control by the
employer in order to protect others from an unreasonable
risk of bodily harm, the employer can have no liability to
an injured plaintiff pursuant to Restatement § 317." 
Wong-Leong v. Hawaiian Indep. Refinery, Inc., 76 Hawaif i 433, 
445, 879 P.2d 538, 550 (1994) (citing Abraham v. S. E. Onorato 
Garages, 50 Haw. 628, 446 P.2d 821 (1968)). 
Plaintiffs cite to Wong-Leong, in which the court held 
that an employer had a duty to control an employee who caused a 
fatal car accident when the employer knew of the employees 
regular consumption of alcohol on work property. Wong-Leong, 76 
Hawaifi at 446, 879 P.2d at 551. The court in Wong-Leong held 
that when "employees are systematically and consistently 
consuming alcohol on company premises after working hours," an 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9employer should know of the necessity and opportunity to control
its employees "as to avoid the foreseeable risk that an
inebriated employee will injure a third party in a motor vehicle
accident."  Id.
In this case, no such foreseeable risk was present. 
While Marriott did know of the affair, and of Mateo's knowledge
of the affair, Marriott had no reason to know or believe that
Mateo would cause harm to Rafol on Marriott property.  There is
no evidence to indicate that Rafol had violent tendencies or that
he was noticeably upset at work over the affair.  Because
Marriott neither knew, nor should have known of the necessity for
exercising such control over Mateo, Plaintiffs failed to
establish that Marriott had a duty to control Mateo.
