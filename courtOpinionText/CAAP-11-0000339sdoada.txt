(CASE NOS. 1P110-10501 & 1P110-10502)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Tokim Wickman ("Wickman") appeals
 
from the March 15, 2011 Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division ("District Court").
1 The District Court found Wickman
 
guilty of one count of prostitution in violation of Hawaii
 
2
Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 712-1200 (1993)  and one count of
engaging or attempting to engage in the occupation or practice of
 massage for compensation without a license ("massage license
 required") in violation of HRS § 452-2 (1993).

engages in, or agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with another
person for a fee." H AW. REV. STAT. § 712-1200(1).

 License required. (a) It is unlawful for any
person in the State to engage in or attempt to engage in the
occupation or practice of massage for compensation without a
current massage therapist license issued pursuant to this
chapter.
 
(b) A massage therapist apprentice who has a permit,
or a massage therapist student under the direct supervision
of a teacher in a massage school setting, is also permitted
(continued...)

Wickman argues that (1) there is no substantial
 
evidence supporting Wickman's conviction for massage license
 
required because (a) the State failed to present evidence that
 Wickman was not a "massage therapist apprentice who has a permit"
 or was not a person "holding any valid license, permit, or
 certificate dealing with the healing arts" pursuant to HRS
 
4
§§ 452-2(b) and 452-21 (1993)  and (b) the massage Wickman gave
the undercover officer ("Undercover Officer") was not the type of
 massage that HRS § 452-2 seeks to regulate. 
Wickman also argues
 
that (2) there was no substantial evidence to support her
 convictions for prostitution or massage license required because
 Undercover Officer's testimony was not credible. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the judgment and resolve Wickman's points of error as
 follows:
 
(1)(a)
 
The general and well-settled common law rule is that where
an exception is embodied in the language of the enacting
clause of a criminal statute, [ 5
] and therefore appears to be
an integral part of the verbal description of the offense,
the burden is on the prosecution to negative that exception,
prima facie, as part of its main case.
 
. . . When the exception appears somewhere other than
in the enacting clause, and is thus a distinct substantive
exception or proviso, the burden is on the defendant to
 
3(...continued)
to engage in or attempt to engage in the occupation or
practice of massage.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 452-2.
 
4 Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit service in
case of emergency, or domestic administration, without
compensation, nor services by persons holding any valid
license, permit, or certificate dealing with the healing
arts, nor services by barbers, hairdressers, cosmeticians,
and cosmetologists lawfully carrying on their particular
profession or business under any existing law of this State.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 452-21.

 The "enacting clause" is "the prohibitory declaration of the
statute which contains the general or preliminary description of the acts
prohibited; i.e., the clause which proscribes the offensive deed." State v. 
Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 137 n.7, 976 P.2d 444, 451 n.7 (1999) (quoting State v. 
Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. 353, 357 n.1, 873 P.2d 110, 112 n.1 (1994)).

bring forward evidence of exceptive facts that constitute a
defense. The prosecutor is not required in such instances
to negative, by proof in advance, exceptions not found in
the enacting clause.
 
Lee, 90 Hawai' i at 137–38, 976 P.2d at 451–52 (original footnote, 
citations, and brackets omitted) (quoting Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. 
at 358, 873 P.2d at 112–13, overruled on other grounds by State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai' i 172, 178–79, 907 P.2d 758, 764–65 (1995)). 
Put another way, "the State has the initial burden of negativing statutory exceptions to an offense only if the exceptions are incorporated into the definition of the offense." Nobriga, 10 
Haw. App. at 359, 873 P.2d at 113. "If a statutory exception to an offense constitutes a separate and distinct defense, however, the State's burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt arises only after evidence of the defense is first raised by the defendant." Id. 
Here, the exceptions found in HRS §§ 452-2(b) and 452­
21 are not contained in the enacting clause of the offense of massage license required, which is found in HRS § 452-2(a). Cf. Lee, 90 Hawai' i at 138 n.8, 976 P.2d at 452 n.8 (self-insurance 
exception found in subsection (a)(2) of statute not part of the enacting clause of (a)(1)); State v. Romano, 114 Hawai' i 1, 6, 
155 P.3d 1102, 1107 (2007) (exception to offense of prostitution for law enforcement officers found in HRS § 712-1200(5) was not located in the enacting clause in HRS § 712-1200(1)). They do, however, constitute separate defenses. See Romano, 114 Hawai' i 
at 6, 155 P.3d at 1107; Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. at 358–59, 873 P.2d at 113 (a statutory exception is a defense if it negatives penal liability). Thus, some evidence of exceptive facts constituting the defenses needed to be presented before the State had the burden of disproving them. Wickman points us to no evidence presented at trial that would have indicated that she was either a "massage therapist apprentice who has a permit" or a person "holding any valid license, permit, or certificate dealing with the healing arts" under HRS § 452-2(b) or § 452-21. Therefore, Wickman has not shown error. 
(1)(b) Undercover Officer testified that, after giving
 
Wickman $150 with the common understanding that he was giving her
 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the money in exchange for a massage and sex, Wickman proceeded to
 
massage his shoulders, neck, and lower back. Given the broad
 
6
definition of "massage" found in HRS § 452-1 (1993),  this
testimony constitutes substantial evidence in support of
 Wickman's conviction for massage license required. It is
 inconsequential that Wickman massaged Undercover Officer in a bar
 and not a massage parlor, that Wickman did not hold herself out
 to be a massage therapist, or that Wickman characterizes the
 massage as informal physical contact. Furthermore, to the extent
 that the form of massage is relevant, Wickman's argument that her
 massage did not constitute a form of "treatment" is plainly
 contradicted by her own testimony that she massaged Undercover
 Officer's shoulders because he said he was sore from golfing. 
Therefore, we reject Wickman's argument that the massage she gave
 to Undercover Officer was not the type of unlicensed massage
 regulated by HRS § 452-2(a).
 
(2) Wickman's argument that no substantial evidence 
supported her convictions for prostitution and massage license required because Undercover Officer's testimony was not credible is without merit. 
Undercover Officer's testimony supported the 
convictions. The District Court, noting that "two different stories" had been presented at trial, found that Undercover Officer's testimony was the credible version of the story. The District Court was entitled to make this credibility determination. See Romano, 114 Hawai' i at 8, 155 P.3d at 1109 
("Matters of credibility and the weight of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn are for the fact finder."). 
6
 HRS § 452-1 defines "massage" to mean
 
any method of treatment of the superficial soft parts of the
body, consisting of rubbing, stroking, tapotement, pressing,
shaking, or kneading with the hands, feet, elbow, or arms,
and whether or not aided by any mechanical or electrical
apparatus, appliances, or supplementary aids such as rubbing
alcohol, liniments, antiseptics, oils, powder, creams,
lotions, ointments, or other similar preparations commonly
used in this practice. Any mechanical or electrical
apparatus used as described in this chapter shall be
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.
