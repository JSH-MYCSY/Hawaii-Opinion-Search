Resources (DLNR), William J. Aila, Jr. (Aila), and Eric A.
 
Knudsen Trust (Knudsen Trust) (collectively, Defendants) and
 
against Blake.
 
On appeal, Blake contends the circuit court erred in
 
granting "Defendants [DLNR] and [Aila's] Motion for Summary
 
Judgment as to the First Amended Complaint for Declaratory and
 
Injunctive Relief Filed on October 7, 2010," (October 7, 2010
 
Motion for Summary Judgment) and dismissing the case as to all
 
counts and all parties when the court concluded it lacked subject
 
matter jurisdiction because the case was not ripe. Blake also
 
contends the circuit court erred in dismissing his "First Amended
 
Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief" (First Amended
 
Complaint) because the dismissal effectively denied his motions
 
for partial summary judgment, which he contends should have been
 
granted as a matter of law.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 12, 2009, Blake filed a six-count "Complaint 
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief" (Complaint) against 
Defendants regarding final subdivision approval granted by the 
Planning Commission to Knudsen Trust for Phase One of its 
"Village at Po' ipu" development. On July 7, 2009, Blake filed a 
Motion for Preliminary Injunction to prevent construction or land-altering activity within fifty feet of Hapa Trail and the 
adjacent walls. On July 27, 2009, the circuit court denied his 
motion. On August 20, 2009, Blake filed his First Amended 
Complaint, adding two counts solely against Knudsen Trust.
3 
On July 21, 2010, Blake filed two motions for partial
 
summary judgment as to various counts in his First Amended
 
Complaint. Defendants filed a number of cross-motions for
 
3
 The eight counts in the First Amended Complaint are: Count 1-Breach
of Public Trust; Count 2-Failure to Investigate and Protect Native Hawaiian
Rights; Count 3-Violation of Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) Chapter 13-284;
Count 4-Irreparable Injury to Historic Sites, Including Burial Sites; Count 5­Noncompliance with Objectives, Policies, and Guidelines of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) § 205A; Count 6-Failure to Require a Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement for the Hapa Trail Breach;, Count 7-Public Nuisance; and
Count 8-Negligence.

summary judgment and joinder, including the October 7, 2010
 
Motion for Summary Judgment. The circuit court heard all the
 
motions on October 26, 2010 and December 7, 2010.
 
On February 17, 2011, the court entered its order
 
granting the October 7, 2010 Motion for Summary Judgment. The
 
court dismissed the remaining claims against the other defendants
 
based on judicial economy. On April 4, 2011, the court entered
 
Final Judgment, from which Blake timely appeals.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 
Hawai'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. 
Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). The Hawai' i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
"summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, 
answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with 
the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to 
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law." Querubin, 107 Hawai' i at 56, 109 
P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 105 Hawai' i at 501, 100 P.3d at 
71). 
B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Ripeness
 
"Subject matter jurisdiction is concerned with whether 
the court has the power to hear a case." Pele Defense Fund v. 
Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 64, 67, 881 P.2d 1210, 1213 
(1994). Lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived 
by a party. Public Access Shoreline Hawaii v. Hawaii Cnty. 
Planning Commission, 79 Hawai' i 425, 431, 903 P.2d 1246, 1252 
(1995). It is appropriate at any stage of a case for a court to determine whether it has jurisdiction in a matter. Chun v. 
Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai' i, 73 Haw. 9, 14, 828 
P.2d 260, 263 (1992). "[R]ipeness is an issue of subject matter 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdiction." Kapuwai v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, Dep't of 
Parks & Recreation, 121 Hawai' i 33, 39, 211 P.3d 750, 756 (2009). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The circuit court did not err when it determined that
 
it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider this case on
 
its merits because the matter was not ripe for adjudication.
 
"[T]he ripeness doctrine prevents courts from deciding
 
theoretical or abstract questions that do not yet have a concrete
 
impact on the parties." Rice v. Cayetano, 941 F.Supp. 1529, 1538
 
(D. Hawai' i 1996), rev'd on other grounds, Rice v. Cayetano, 528 
U.S. 495 (2000). The Hawai' i Supreme Court has applied the 
federal courts' legal standard in considering whether a claim is
 
ripe for adjudication:
 
Because ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing, the
court must look at the facts as they exist today in
evaluating whether the controversy before us is sufficiently
concrete to warrant our intervention. The ripeness inquiry
has two prongs: the fitness of the issues for judicial
decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding
court consideration. The fitness element requires that the
issue be primarily legal, need no further factual
development, and involve a final agency action. To meet the
 hardship requirement, a party must show that withholding
judicial review would result in direct and immediate
hardship and would entail more than possible financial loss.
 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Hous. & Cmty. Dev. Corp. of Hawai' i 
(HCDCH), 121 Hawai' i 324, 336, 219 P.3d 1111, 1123 (2009) 
(quoting Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Hous. & Cmty. Dev. Corp. 
of Hawai' i, 117 Hawai' i 174, 207, 177 P.3d 884, 917 (2008), rev'd 
and remanded on other grounds, Hawai' i, et al. v. Office of 
Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.S. 163 (2009)) (emphasis omitted). 
To meet the first prong of the ripeness inquiry, the 
issue must "be primarily legal, need no further factual 
development, and involve a final agency action." OHA v. HCDCH, 
121 Hawai' i at 336, 219 P.3d at 1123. Because the first prong is 
set out in the conjunctive, failing one portion of the prong 
defeats the entire prong. And where the first prong is not met, 
there is no need to consider the second prong as to hardship 
incurred from withholding judicial review.

Blake's complaint fails to meet the first prong because 
the matter does not involve a final agency action. On January 
13, 2009, the Planning Commission granted final subdivision 
approval of Knudsen Trust's proposed Phase One of the subdivision 
"Village at Po' ipu," a development of 208 acres in the ahupua' a of 
Koloa on the island of Kaua' i. Phase One consisted "of 
approximately 20 acres located mauka of Po' ipu Road and . . . 
bordered on [the] west by Hapa [Trail] and on the south by 
Kiahuna Tennis Club." The plans "called for vehicular or other 
access across . . . Hapa Trail." According to the County, the 
subdivision approval did not include the grant of an easement 
across Hapa Trail. 
Blake alleged in Count 6 of his Complaint that "Hapa
 
Trail is an unimproved Kauai county roadway[.]" At that time,
 
the other parties also believed Hapa Trail was owned by the
 
County. Among Blake's allegations in his Complaint, he contended
 
that Knudsen Trust's plan to breach the trail to allow vehicular
 
traffic represented "a significant change in scope and use," and
 
thus required the submission of a supplemental Environmental
 
Impact Statement before the Planning Commission could grant
 
subdivision approval. Blake sought an injunction to enjoin
 
Knudsen Trust "from commencing any work on Phase One of its
 
project until all approvals are properly authorized."
 
On June 18, 2009, Blake moved to amend his Complaint,
 
in part because he discovered that Hapa Trail was owned by the
 
State, not the County. In its February 17, 2011 order granting
 
the October 7, 2010 Motion for Summary Judgment, the circuit
 
court found that Hapa Trail was owned by the State. That finding
 
is not disputed on appeal.
 
The Planning Commission's final subdivision approval of 
Phase One of the "Village at Po' ipu" as it related to access to 
the project by crossing Hapa Trail was based on a mistaken belief that Hapa Trail was owned by the County. Because Hapa Trail is 
in fact owned by the State, the County did not have the authority 
to give the January 13, 2009 final subdivision approval as it 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
related to Hapa Trail. Although the State Historic Preservation
 
Division approved a proposal for breach of Hapa Trail and
 
concomitant mitigation, Knudsen Trust must receive approval from
 
the State, specifically the Board of Land and Natural Resources
 
4
(BLNR),  for an easement across Hapa Trail before it can breach
the road. 
BLNR had not been part of the subdivision approval
 
process. Knudsen Trust might decide to consider other options
 for access to the project, or if it does make a request for
 
access, BLNR might deny the request. As it is, Phase One of the
 
project cannot proceed under its current approvals and is
 
dependant on either final agency action or a modification of its
 
current County approvals.
 
Therefore, Blake failed to satisfy the first prong of
 
the ripeness test because there was not a final agency action. 
Failing the first prong, we need not examine the second prong. 
The circuit court correctly concluded that it did not have
 
subject matter jurisdiction over this case.
 
The circuit court did not err when it dismissed all
 
other claims. 
The court found the various claims to be
 
inextricably intertwined and interrelated and expressed a concern
 that moving forward on some of the claims could result in
 
piecemeal litigation, which the courts try to avoid in the
 
interest of judicial economy. See, e.g., Hawaii Hous. Auth. v.
 
Lyman, 68 Haw. 55, 78, 704 P.2d 888, 902 (1985) (trial court has
 discretion to weigh the potential of waste of judicial
 
resources); Kauhane V. Acutron Co., 71 Haw. 458, 463, 795 P.2d
 
276, 278 (1990) (doctrine of res judicata serves to conserve
 
judicial resources). 
Finally, because the circuit court dismissed the case,
 
it did not rule on Blake's motions for partial summary judgment
 
and therefore, Blake's second point of error is without merit.
