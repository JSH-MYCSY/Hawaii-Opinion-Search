(CIVIL NO. 08-1-304)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from a complaint for foreclosure
 
filed by Plaintiff-Appellee Bismark Mortgage Company, LLC
 
(Bismark), in which Bismark alleged an outstanding balance due on
 a promissory note executed by Defendants-Appellants Lisa U. Pai
 and Michael P. Pai (the Pais). The promissory note was secured
 by a mortgage on property located in Pahoa, Hawaii (the
 Property).
 
The Pais filed notices of appeal seeking to appeal from
 
1
three series of orders  entered in the Circuit Court of the Third

Commissioner's Sale of Property at Public Sale, Directing Distribution of
Proceeds, for Writ of Possession and for Disposal of Personal Property";

Circuit (circuit court).2
 
The Pais' opening brief fails to comply with Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 for a variety of 
reasons, including that: the brief fails to provide any record citation in support of any asserted facts; and with regard to their points of error, the Pais fail to clearly set forth their points of error and fail to state "where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court or agency." HRAP Rule 28(b)(3) and (4)(iii). Notwithstanding these violations, we address the Pais' appeal as set forth below. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 relevant authorities, we dismiss this appeal because the Pais
 lack standing.
I. Procedural Background
 
On September 24, 2008, Bismark initiated foreclosure
 
proceedings against the Pais after the Pais defaulted on their
 
mortgage payments. Almost a year later, on September 8, 2009,
 the parties entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement
 (Settlement Agreement) wherein Bismark agreed to accept $60,000
 for full satisfaction of the mortgage if paid on or before
 November 25, 2009 and the Pais agreed to release all previously
 asserted claims against Bismark and to stipulate to dismiss their
 counterclaims and third-party complaints. The parties stipulated

U. Pai's and Michael P. Pai's Motion to Set Aside Stipulated Settlement of the
Parties and to Permit Amended Answer and Amended Third Party Complaint," filed
in the circuit court on March 29, 2011.
 
In their "Second Amended Notice of Appeal," filed on June 7, 2011, the
Pais seek to additionally appeal the "Order Denying (1) Defendants' Oral
Motion to Continue Hearing, (2) Defendants/Counterclaim Plaintiffs/Third Party
Plaintiffs Lisa U. Pai and Michael P. Pai's Motion to Set Aside Stipulated
Settlement of the Parties and to Permit Amended Answer and Amended Third Party
Complaint, filed February 15, 2011, and (3) Third-Party Defendant C. Randall
Church's Oral Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs," filed in the
circuit court on May 9, 2011.

to dismiss the Pais' counterclaims and third-party claims on
 
September 10, 2009. 
When the Pais failed to comply with the Settlement
 
Agreement, Bismark proceeded with the foreclosure of the
 Property. On May 6, 2010, the circuit court entered inter alia
 an Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure in favor of Bismark and
 also a Judgement on the decree of foreclosure. Although the Pais
 could have appealed at this point, they did not file an appeal
 from the Judgment on the decree of foreclosure. See Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51 (2013 Supp.).
 
The Property was sold to Bismark at a public auction on
 
July 28, 2010. On August 2, 2010, Bismark filed a motion for
 confirmation of sale and for writ of possession. However, on
 September 8, 2010, the Pais filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Case
 Filing, advising the circuit court and Bismark that the Pais had
 filed for bankruptcy the day before, on September 7, 2010. Upon
 the Pais' filing for bankruptcy, the circuit court proceedings
 were automatically stayed. Bismark thereafter obtained relief
 from the automatic stay on November 30, 2010, which allowed
 Bismark to "exercise any rights and remedies under the applicable
 nonbankruptcy law with respect to the subject property[.]"
 
Subsequently, the Pais filed an opposition to Bismark's
 
motion for confirmation of sale and for writ of possession. The
 Pais also filed a motion to set aside the stipulated settlement
 of the parties. On March 16, 2011, the circuit court inter alia
 confirmed the sale of the Property to Bismark, and also entered a
 Judgment confirming the sale to Bismark and for writ of
 possession. The Pais' subsequent attempts to stay the
 confirmation of sale and the writ of possession were denied. 
Between April 15, 2011 and June 7, 2011, the Pais filed their
 three notices of appeal.
 
Bismark contends in its answering brief that the Pais'
 
debts were discharged in bankruptcy on May 10, 2011, which the
 Pais do not dispute in their reply brief.

II. The Pais Lack Standing in this Appeal
 
Whether a party has standing to appeal is a threshold 
matter. "It is well-settled that courts must determine as a 
threshold matter whether they have jurisdiction to decide the issues presented. If a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the action." Hawaii Med. Ass'n v. Hawaii Med. Serv. Ass'n, 113 
Hawai
'i 77, 94, 148 P.3d 1179, 1196 (2006) (internal citation 
omitted); see State v. Moniz, 69 Haw. 370, 373, 742 P.2d 373, 375 (1987) (holding that appellants were not aggrieved by the lower court's orders and thus lacked standing to appeal). 
Generally, the requirements of standing to appeal are: (1)
the person must first have been a party to the action; (2)
the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and
(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by the
appealable order.
 
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai 'i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) 
(citation and emphasis omitted). "[A]lthough lack of standing is 
raised by the defendant, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that he or she has standing." Hawaii Med. Ass'n, 
113 Hawai
'i at 95, 148 P.3d at 1197; see Sierra Club v. Hawaii 
Tourism Auth., 100 Hawai 'i 242, 250, 59 P.3d 877, 885 (2002) ("A 
plaintiff without standing is not entitled to invoke a court's jurisdiction. Accordingly, Petitioner must establish its standing for this court to exercise jurisdiction over this case." (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). 
Bismark alleges that all of the Pais' claims are the
 
property of the bankruptcy estate and thus the Pais lack standing
 in this appeal.
 
Subject to certain exemptions that are not relevant in
 
this case, the Bankruptcy Code, United States Code (U.S.C.)
 chapter 11, section 541(a)(1) (2012) establishes that when a
 petitioner files a bankruptcy petition with the bankruptcy court,
 the bankruptcy estate that is thereby created includes "all legal
 or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the
 commencement of the case." 11 U.S.C. 541(a)(1) (emphasis added).

In The Queen Emma Foundation v. Tatibouet, 123 Hawai 'i 
500, 509, 236 P.3d 1236, 1245 (App. 2010), this court recognized 
that "[v]irtually all of a debtor's assets, including causes of action that belong to the debtor at the commencement of a bankruptcy case, vest in the bankruptcy estate upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition." (Citing 11 U.S.C. § 541 (a)(1) (2006); Turner v. Cook, 362 F.3d 1219, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 2004)). In Turner, the Ninth Circuit stated in unambiguous terms, 
[b]ecause [the appellant] has filed for bankruptcy . . . he
is no longer a real party in interest in this matter and has
no standing to pursue this appeal. When Turner declared
 bankruptcy, all the "legal or equitable interests" he had in
his property became the property of the bankruptcy estate
and are represented by the bankruptcy trustee. See 11
 
U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). Causes of action are among such legal
or equitable interests.
 
Turner, 362 F.3d at 1225-26; see Rowland v. Novus Fin. Corp., 949
 
F. Supp. 1447, 1453-54 (D. Haw. 1996) (holding that plaintiff
 lacked standing to assert Truth in Lending Act claims because he
 filed for bankruptcy and the claim was the property of the
 bankruptcy estate, unless plaintiff could show the claim was
 exempt from the bankruptcy estate or abandoned by the bankruptcy
 trustee).
 
When the Pais filed for bankruptcy in September 2010, 
all of their legal and equitable interests, including any interests in the Property or any causes of action they had, became the property of the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U.S.C. 
541(a)(1). The Pais have not asserted or provided any evidence in the record that the Property and/or their claims were exempt from the bankruptcy estate or were abandoned by the bankruptcy trustee. In this circumstance, and where the record reflects the bankruptcy filing by the Pais, they have not met their burden to establish their standing to appeal because they have not demonstrated that they have been aggrieved by the circuit court's orders and Judgment from which they seek to appeal. See Hawaii 
Med. Ass'n, 113 Hawai
'i at 95, 148 P.3d at 1197; Abaya, 112 
Hawai'i at 181, 145 P.3d at 724. The Pais are not affected or 
prejudiced by the orders or Judgment from which they appeal 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because they have no remaining interests in the Property or the
 
purported claims. Any interests of the Pais in the Property or
 the claims related to the foreclosure proceedings became the
 property of the bankruptcy estate when the Pais filed their
 bankruptcy petition. See Rowland, 949 F. Supp. at 1453; Griffin
 
v. Allstate Ins. Co., 920 F. Supp. 127, 130 (C.D. Cal. 1996)
 ("Because the bankruptcy trustee controls the bankruptcy estate,
 it is the real party in interest in the suits that belong to the
 estate.").
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, appellate case number CAAP-11­
0000343 is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction
 
because the Pais lack standing.
