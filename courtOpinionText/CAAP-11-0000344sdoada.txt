jail. The court also suspended his driver's license for thirty
 
days, effective March 22, 2011.
 
On appeal, Pai argues that the district court erred in 
admitting at trial evidence of the laser-gun reading used to cite 
him for Excessive Speeding, after Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i (State) failed to establish that (1) the laser gun, 
described at trial as the "LTI 20/20 UltraLyte" (alternatively, "UltraLyte" and "device"), was tested according to the 
manufacturer's recommended procedures and found to be working 
properly, (2) the nature and extent of Officer Mark Hada's 
(Officer Hada's) training in the use of the UltraLyte met the 
requirements indicated by the manufacturer, and (3) the UltraLyte 
had been inspected and serviced as required by the manufacturer. 
Pai asks this court to reverse his conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Pai's points of error as follows:
 
The district court did not abuse its discretion by 
admitting at trial evidence of the UltraLyte speed reading. The 
State established that Officer Hada tested the device according 
to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. See State v. 
Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 212, 216 P.3d 1227, 1235 (2009). In his 
testimony, Officer Hada stated that according to the 
manufacturer's recommendations, he was required to conduct a self 
test, display test, scope alignment test, and delta distance test 
on the UltraLyte. His August, 2010 training on how to conduct 
the tests was consistent with the instructions in the LTI-printed 
manual that came with the device (the manual). He conducted the 
tests in compliance with the manufacturer's recommended standards 
on the day of the incident, prior to issuing Pai a citation. 
According to the tests, the device was working properly. 
The State showed that Officer Hada had "personal 
knowledge" of the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the 
testing of the UltraLyte. See Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213, 216

P.3d at 1236 (discussing State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai' i 343, 354, 
167 P.3d 336, 347 (2007)). The officer testified that he knew he 
tested the device in accordance with the manufacturer's 
recommended procedures because he read the manual. 
The State established that Officer Hada was trained in 
the operation of the UltraLyte according to the manufacturer's 
requirements. See Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. 
Officer Hada testified that he read the manual. In August, 2010, he received instructor training in a three-day class taught by 
Bob Lung (Lung), a retired police officer and law enforcement 
liaison with the Hawai' i State Department of Transportation, who 
had been trained by LTI in 1992 as an instructor and certified through LTI since then. LTI created the information that was 
handed out at the class. In his training, Officer Hada learned 
how to properly test and operate the UltraLyte according to the 
manufacturer's recommended standards. As a result of his 
training, he was LTI-certified in the use of the UltraLyte. 
Officer Hada's 1998 training in how to use the LTI 
20/20 Marksman is irrelevant to the district court's admission of 
the speed reading evidence obtained using the UltraLyte. 
Further, Pai cites to no authority suggesting that the State was 
required to submit proof that Lung was LTI-certified, and we find 
none. 
Pai provides no authority to support the notion that 
the State was required to establish specifically that the 
UltraLyte was inspected and serviced as required by the 
manufacturer, and we find none. Pai cites to the concurrence in 
Assaye to support this point; but in that case, the majority did 
not require any showing of inspection and service as required by 
the manufacturer but only that the citing officer had "personal 
knowledge" of the contents of the manufacturer's recommended 
procedures and that the laser gun had been tested according to 
the those procedures. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 212, 215, 216 P.3d 
at 1235, 1238.

Given the foregoing, and considering the evidence in 
the light most favorable to the State, there was substantial 
evidence that Pai committed Excessive Speeding. State v. 
Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157–58, 166 P.3d 322, 330–31 (2007). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on March 21,
 2011 in the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku
 
Division is affirmed.
