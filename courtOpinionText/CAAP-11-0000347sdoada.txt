IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JULIE PHOMPHITHACK, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 05-1-1387)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Julie Phomphithack ("Phomphithack")
 
appeals from the Order Granting State's Motion for Reimbursement
 
of Extradition Costs ("Order"), entered on March 29, 2011, in the
 
1
First Circuit Court ("Circuit Court") , in which the Circuit
Court directed that "Phomphithack shall reimburse the State of
 Hawaii for extradition costs in the amount of $
2,329.97."
 
On appeal, Phomphithack contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred in entering the Order because (1) she is not a "nonindigent
 
2
defendant" under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 621-9(b),  and
1
 The Honorable Steven S. Alm presided.

 Whenever the presence of a defendant in a
criminal case or in a proceeding under chapter 704 or
a petitioner in a post conviction proceeding who is
outside the judicial circuit is mandated by court
order or bench warrant to appear, the costs of
airfare, ground transportation, any per diem for both
the defendant or petitioner and sufficient law
enforcement officers to effect the defendant's or
 petitioner's return, shall be borne by the
State. . . . The court may order the nonindigent
defendant or petitioner who was returned to the State
of Hawaii to reimburse the State for the costs of such
 extradition or return as specifically described above.

AW. REV. STAT. § 621-9(b) (1993).

(2) the imposition of extradition reimbursement costs violated 
the double jeopardy clause of article I, section 10 of the Hawai'i State Constitution. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Phomphithack's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Phomphithack argues that because she was previously
 
determined by the Circuit Court to be indigent for the purposes
 of receiving court-appointed counsel, she is also indigent for
 purposes of assessing costs associated with her extradition from
 Nevada.
 
A determination of indigency under HRS § 802-4
3 to
 
satisfy the constitutional imperative of state-provided counsel
 for a defendant charged with a crime who can not herself afford
 counsel, however, is a different inquiry from one made pursuant
 to HRS § 621-9. The determinations are related, but independent,
 and are left to the discretion of the trial court. See
 
McFatridge v. State, 309 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010)
 (comparing indigency for purposes of appointing counsel and
 indigency for purposes of obtaining a free record); Meeker v.
 State, 395 N.E.2d 301, 307 n.5 (Ind. Ct. App. 1979) ("The finding
 of [a defendant's] indigency for the purpose of appointing
 defense counsel" is not determinative of his "ability to pay
 court costs and fines[.]").
 
A lower court's decision to deny a defendant in forma 
pauperis status is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Blaisdell v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 113 Hawai' i 315, 
3
 Determination of indigency. Unless otherwise
 
ordered by the court, the determination of indigency
shall be made by a public defender, subject to review
by the court. Such determination shall be based upon
an appropriate inquiry into the financial
circumstances of the person seeking legal
representation and an affidavit or a certificate
signed by such person demonstrating the person's
financial inability to obtain legal counsel. A person
shall waive the person's right to counsel by refusing
to furnish any information pertinent to the
determination of indigency.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 802-4 (1993).

319, 151 P.3d 796, 800 (2007). We apply the same standard to our 
review of the Circuit Court's determination of nonindigency under HRS § 621-9. An abuse of discretion "is apparent when a trial court's discretion clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Kimura v. Kamalo, 
106 Hawai' i 501, 507, 107 P.3d 430, 436 (2005) (quoting Sugarman 
v. Kapu, 104 Hawai' i 119, 125, 85 P.3d 644, 649 (2004)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Indigency is not defined by statute, although the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has determined factors that can be weighed 
when determining eligibility for a court-appointed lawyer. State 
v. Mickle, 56 Haw. 23, 27, 525 P.2d 1108, 1111 (1974). The fact
 that the Circuit Court determined indigency for purposes of
 court-appointed counsel under HRS § 802-4, though, does not
 resolve the issue of indigency for purposes of a subsequent
 assessment of extradition costs under HRS § 621-9. 
Phomphithack's argument that it does ignores the fact that (i)
 the first determination is made upon the recommendation of the
 public defender while the second is not, (ii) the second
 determination was made more than five years after the first and
 only after Phomphithack had been sentenced to a term in prison,
 (iii) Phomphithack was reported by her counsel to have been "living with her parents" and having "maintained gainful employment" in Las Vegas before her arrest, and (iv) a prior determination of indigency is not reflective of a permanent condition. The Circuit Court's ruling on the issue reflects that it relied upon the potential that Phomphithack could earn money in prison. This, however, is an insufficient basis on which to find that Phomphithack was nonindigent. See Blaisdell, 113 
Hawai'i at 319, 151 P.3d at 800 (concluding that trial court 
erred in denying in forma pauperis status regarding filing fees of $275 to petitioner confined in prison, with $15.25 in his prison account, earning $40 per month, and without other income). 
In addition, insofar as the Circuit Court treats the
 
extradition costs like restitution, which is properly imposed

without considering the ability to pay, HRS § 706-605(7)4 
requires the court to consider the ability to pay in establishing 
the time and manner of payment. See State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 
127, 153, 890 P.2d 1167, 1193 (1995) (requiring the sentencing court to enter into the record findings that the manner of payment of restitution is reasonable and one that the defendant could afford). 
(2) Phomphithack contends that the Order violates the 
prohibition against multiple punishments under the double jeopardy clause of article I, section 10 of the Hawai' i State 
Constitution. We disagree. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has adopted the United States 
Supreme Court's two-part test to determine whether a particular sanction constitutes a "separate punishment" that violates the double jeopardy clause. State v. Tuipuapua, 83 Hawai' i 141, 151, 
925 P.2d 311, 321 (1996) (citing United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267 (1996)). Applying the first prong of the test, and reviewing the legislative history of the statute in question, we conclude that the Hawai' i Legislature intended HRS § 621-9 to be 
"civil" in nature. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1597-88, in 1988 
House Journal, at 1394. 
Under the second prong, we next apply the seven-factor 
analysis adopted by the Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Guidry, 
105 Hawai' i 222, 235-36, 96 P.3d 242, 255-56 (2004), and conclude 
that HRS § 621-9 is not "so punitive in form and effect as to render [it] criminal despite [the Legislature's] intent to the contrary." Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 104 (1997) 
(quoting Ursery, 518 U.S. at 290) (internal quotation marks omitted).

 (7) The court shall order the defendant to
 
make restitution for losses as provided in
section 706-646. In ordering restitution, the
court shall not consider the defendant's
 financial ability to make restitution in
determining the amount of restitution to order.
The court, however, shall consider the
defendant's financial ability to make
restitution for the purpose of establishing the
time and manner of payment.

It is required that the "party challenging the statute 
. . . provide 'the clearest proof' that the statutory scheme is 
so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the State's nonpunitive intent." Guidry, 105 Hawai' i at 236, 96 P.3d at 256 
(quoting Russell v. Gregoire, 124 F.3d 1079, 1087 (9th Cir. 1997)). Phomphithack here fails to provide the requisite "clearest proof" that the imposition of extradition costs is sufficiently punitive in its form or effect that it outweighs its remedial effect. Therefore, the imposition of extradition costs is not "punishment" for double jeopardy purposes. 
Therefore, for the reasons expressed above, we vacate
 
the March 29, 2011 Order Granting State's Motion for
 Reimbursement of Extradition Costs. On remand, the Circuit Court
 is instructed to provide specific findings to support its
 decision.
