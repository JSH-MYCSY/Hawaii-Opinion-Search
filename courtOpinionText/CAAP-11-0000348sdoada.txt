v.
 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, STATE OF HAWAII,
AND GERALD TERAMAE, Defendants-Appellees,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-1969)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Tad A. Ling (Ling) appeals from the
 
Final Judgment (Judgment) filed on April 7, 2011 in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1 The circuit court
 
entered judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Department of
 Education, State of Hawaii and Gerald Teramae, in his official
 capacity (collectively, the DOE), and Teramae, in his individual
 capacity (Teramae) as to all claims asserted by Ling. The
 Judgment incorporates by reference the court's 
(1) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting [the DOE's] Amended Motion for Dismissal, or in the

Alternative, for Summary Judgment, Filed November 23, 2010,"
 
filed on March 3, 2011; and 
(2) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting [Teramae's] Motion for Dismissal, or in the Alternative,
 for Summary Judgment Filed December 15, 2010," filed on
 March 3, 2011.
 
On appeal, Ling argues that the circuit court
 
erroneously granted "[The DOE's] Amended Motion for Dismissal, or
 in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment," and "[Teramae's]
 Motion for Dismissal, or in the Alternative, for Summary
 Judgment," based on a finding that Ling's claims for IIED were
 barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Ling's points of error as follows:
 
Regardless of when the applicable statutes of 
limitations began to run, Ling failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted. See Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 
Hawai'i 403, 412 & 429, 198 P.3d 666, 675 & 692 (2008) (block 
quotation format and citation omitted) (stating that a complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim if "it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief" and setting forth the elements of IIED); See Kiehm v. Adams 109 Hawai' i 296, 301, 126 P.3d 339, 344 (2005) ("the 
appellate court may affirm a lower court's decision on any ground in the record supporting affirmance, even if not cited by the lower court"). Consequently, the circuit court did not err in granting the motions for summary judgment. See Hays v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 81 Hawai' i 391, 392-93, 917 P.2d 718, 719-20 
(1996) (brackets in original, emphasis, block quotation format, and citations omitted) ("[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show 
2

that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that
 
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.").
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on April
 
7, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 14, 2012.
