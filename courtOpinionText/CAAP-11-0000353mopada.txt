29, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 (circuit
 
court). Final Judgment was entered in favor of Appellees-

Hawai» i (UH); and Virginia Hinshaw (Hinshaw), in her official 
capacity as chancellor of the University of Hawai» i at Manoa 
(collectively, Appellees) and against KOH. Judgment was entered 
pursuant to the "Order Granting Appellees [UH] and [Hinshaw's] 
Motion to Dismiss [KOH's] Notice of Appeal to Circuit Court 
[Filed December 13, 2010][Filed January 4, 2011]," filed March 
15, 2011. BLNR, DLNR, and Aila joined in UH and Hinshaw's motion 
to dismiss. Circuit court granted Appellees' motion to dismiss 
on the grounds it lacked jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) chapter 91. 
On appeal, KOH contends circuit court erred when it 
determined it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and thereby 
granted Appellees' motion to dismiss. 
I.
 
On March 10, 2010, UH submitted a Conservation District 
Use Application (Application) to DLNR for a Conservation District 
Use Permit (Permit) for the proposed Advanced Technology Solar 
Telescope project (ATST project). 
The ATST project involved the 
construction, installation, and operation of a solar telescope at 
the Haleakala High Altitude Observatories Site on Pu» u Kolekole, 
Makawao, Maui. 
On August 26, 2010, BLNR held a public hearing on the
 
Application. On November 22, 2010, at a regular meeting, the
 
BLNR considered the Application but postponed decision making. 
At its next regularly scheduled meeting on December 1, 2010, BLNR
 
again considered the Application. At the meeting, KOH orally
 
requested a contested case hearing. BLNR members voted to grant
 
the Permit for the ATST project. On December 2, 2010, KOH filed
 
a petition for a contested case hearing (Petition).
 
On December 13, 2010, prior to receiving a response to
 
its Petition, KOH filed an administrative agency appeal to
 
circuit court. In its prayer for relief, KOH asked circuit court 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to, among other things, remand the case to BLNR and DLNR for a
 
contested case hearing.
 
On January 4, 2011, UH and Hinshaw filed a motion to
 
dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On January 11,
 
2011, BLNR, DLNR, and Aila filed a joinder to UH and Hinshaw's
 
motion to dismiss.
 
On February 11, 2011, BLNR authorized the appointment
 
of a hearing officer to conduct a hearing on KOH's standing to
 
participate in a contested case hearing, and if standing was
 
found, to conduct a contested case hearing regarding the Permit. 
On February 18, 2011, in light of the contested case
 
hearing proceedings, circuit court orally granted Appellees'
 
motion to dismiss KOH's appeal. On March 15, 2011, circuit court
 
entered its order dismissing the case and, on March 29, 2011,
 
entered Final Judgment.
 
On April 21, 2011, KOH filed its notice of appeal from
 
Final Judgment.
 
II.
 
"The right to appeal is purely statutory and exists 
only when jurisdiction is given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." Lingle v. Hawaii Gov't Employees Ass'n, 
AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 Hawai» i 178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 
593 (2005). As a threshold matter, "every court must . . . 
determine . . . whether it has jurisdiction to decide the 
issue[s] presented." Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal 
Venture, 77 Hawai» i 64, 67, 881 P.2d 1210, 1213 (1994). Here, 
the question is whether the circuit court had subject matter 
jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to HRS ÿÿ 91-14 (1993 & 
Supp. 2009). 
HRS ÿÿ 91-14(a) provides that "any person aggrieved by a
 
final decision and order in a contested case" is entitled to
 
judicial review under HRS chapter 91. To invoke the circuit 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
court's jurisdiction under HRS ÿÿ 91-14, the appellant must meet
 
four requirements:
 
first, the proceeding that resulted in the unfavorable
agency action must have been a "contested case"
hearing -- i.e., a hearing that was (1) required by
law and (2) determined the "rights, duties, and
privileges of specific parties"; second, the agency's
action must represent "a final decision and order," or
"a preliminary ruling" such that deferral of review
would deprive the claimant of adequate relief; third,
the claimant must have followed the applicable agency
rules and, therefore, have been involved "in" the
contested case; and finally, the claimant's legal
interests must have been injured -- i.e., the claimant
must have standing to appeal.
 
[Public Access Shoreline Hawai »i v. Hawai »i County Planning 
Comm'n (PASH)], 79 Hawai »i [425,] 431, 903 P.2d [1246,] 1252
[(1995)] (bold emphases added). 
Kaleikini v. Thielen , 124 Hawai» i 1, 16-17, 237 P.3d 1067, 
1082-83 (2010) (brackets omitted). Because KOH does not meet the 
first criteria--that the agency action stemmed from a contested 
case hearing--we look no further and conclude circuit court did 
not err when it dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. 
When KOH filed its Petition on December 2, 2010, the
 
contested case hearing process began. 
On February 11, 2011, at a
 
regularly scheduled BLNR board meeting, BLNR authorized the
 
appointment of a hearings officer to determine if KOH had
 
standing to request a contested case hearing and if so, to
 
conduct a contested case hearing. On April 4, 2011, the hearings
 
officer held a pre-hearing conference with the parties and
 
scheduled a contested case hearing for July 18-22, 2011. After
 
the hearing, the hearings officer would submit proposed Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and a Decision and Order to the
 
BLNR.
 
On February 18, 2011, when circuit court heard
 
Appellees' motion to dismiss, it was clear there had not yet been
 
a contested case hearing. Because circuit court does not have
 
jurisdiction under HRS ÿÿ 91-14 unless there has been a contested
 
case hearing, it did not err when it dismissed KOH's appeal for
 
lack of jurisdiction.
