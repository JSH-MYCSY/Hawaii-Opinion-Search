Juan's alleged sale of crystal methamphetamine or "ice" to an
 
undercover police officer. 
San Juan entered into a plea agreement with Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai' i (State), in which San Juan agreed to 
plead guilty as charged to Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree, and San Juan and the State agreed to recommend a ten-year indeterminate term of imprisonment with a one-year mandatory minimum term at sentencing. In the plea agreement, as part of the factual basis for his guilty plea, San Juan admitted that "[o]n or about June 1, 2010, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, I knowingly distributed methamphetamine." 
On August 10, 2010, the Circuit Court held a change of 
plea hearing pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 11 
(2007). During the guilty plea colloquy, San Juan acknowledged his understanding of the terms of the plea agreement; that by pleading guilty, he was giving up his right to a trial; and that the statement in his plea agreement that he knowingly distributed methamphetamine was true. At the conclusion of the colloquy, the Circuit Court found that San Juan had entered his guilty plea voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. 
Sentencing was scheduled for October 20, 2010. At the
 
sentencing hearing, San Juan asked that he be allowed to withdraw
 his guilty plea. Defense counsel then made an oral motion to
 withdraw as counsel, which the Circuit Court granted. Sentencing
 was continued to a later date. In the meantime, San Juan, with
 new counsel, filed a written motion to withdraw his guilty plea,
 alleging that: (1) at the time of his guilty plea, he wanted a

convicted of methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree
shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of ten
years with a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less
than one year and not greater than four years and a fine not to
exceed $10,000,000; . . . .

copy of the discovery in his case and a chance to review it, but
 
did not believe he had the right to these things; (2) he had no
 personal knowledge of the contents of the packet he allegedly
 transferred and was merely a conduit between the police officer
 and other individuals; and (3) he believes he is eligible for a
 probation sentence. On March 30, 2011, the Circuit Court denied
 San Juan's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced him
 to ten years of imprisonment with a mandatory minimum term of one
 year. 
II.
 
On appeal, San Juan contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and
 sentencing him without a finding of guilt by trial. San Juan's
 sole argument in support of this contention is that the Circuit
 Court should have permitted him to withdraw his guilty plea
 because he wanted to exercise his constitutional right to have a
 trial. In effect, San Juan contends that he had an absolute
 right to withdraw his guilty plea in order to exercise his right
 to trial.
 
However, controlling case law establishes that "[a]
 
defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw his [or
 her] guilty plea. State v. Jim, 58 Haw. 574, 575, 574 P.2d 521,
 
522 (1978). For a motion to withdraw a guilty plea that is made
 before the imposition of sentence, the applicable standard is
 whether the defendant has presented a "fair and just reason" for
 the withdrawal and whether the State has relied upon the guilty
 plea to its substantial prejudice. Id. at 576, 574 P.2d at
 
522-23. The defendant bears "the burden of establishing
 plausible and legitimate grounds for withdrawal[,]" and the trial
 court's determination of whether the defendant has met this
 burden is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. at 576-77, 574
 
P.2d at 523.
 
We reject San Juan's appeal, which is premised on the
 
argument that he has an absolute right to withdraw his guilty
 plea in order to exercise his right to trial. San Juan's

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argument is refuted by controlling authority. Id. at 575, 574
 
P.2d at 522. In addition, there is no showing in the record that
 
San Juan presented a fair and just reason for withdrawing his
 guilty plea or that the Circuit Court erred in denying his motion
 to withdraw his guilty plea.

 In this regard, we note that San Juan did not include a transcript of
the Circuit Court's ruling on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea as part
of the record on appeal. See State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai' i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499,
502 (2000) (holding that the appellate courts will not presume error from asilent record); Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 11(a) (2010) ("It is
the responsibility of each appellant to provide a record . . . that issufficient to review the points asserted . . . .").
