IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
PETER DELA CRUZ, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAI
'ANAE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1P511-00408)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai
'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellee Peter Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz) by complaint with 
(1) abuse of a family or household member, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906(1) (Supp. 2012); (2) resisting
 an order to stop motor vehicle, in violation of HRS § 710-1027
 (1993 & Supp. 2012); and driving without a license, in violation
 of HRS § 286-136(b) (2007). On March 30, 2011, Dela Cruz
 appeared in the District Court of the First Circuit (District
 
1
Court) and waived his right to a jury trial.  The District Court
 
sua sponte
 raised the question of whether it had jurisdiction
 
over the abuse of a family or household member charge. The
 District Court asked the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA) if he
 agreed that the case did not belong before the District Court.

 The Honorable Christopher J. McKenzie presided.

The DPA responded: "I agree that I'm not sure why this is here." 
Dela Cruz then orally moved to dismiss the case for lack of
 jurisdiction, and the District Court stated, "I'm going to
 dismiss the case." 
Later that day, the District Court filed a "Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order" (March 30, 2011, Judgment), which
 dismissed the abuse of a family or household member charge with
 prejudice. On April 15, 2011, the State filed a motion for
 reconsideration of the dismissal with prejudice. Dela Cruz
 opposed the motion. At a hearing held on April 27, 2011, the
 District Court denied the State's motion to reconsider the
 dismissal of the charge with prejudice, but granted the State's
 request to correct the court minutes to reflect that Dela Cruz,
 and not the State, had orally moved for dismissal. Later that
 day, the District Court entered a "Notice of Entry of Judgment
 and/or Order" (April 27, 2011, Order), which reflected its ruling
 on the State's motion for reconsideration. 
I. 
The State appeals from: (1) the March 30, 2011,
 
Judgment and (2) the April 27, 2011, Order. On appeal, the State
 argues that the District Court was wrong in concluding that it
 lacked jurisdiction over the abuse of a family or household
 member charge against Dela Cruz. The State therefore asserts
 that the District Court erred in granting Dela Cruz's oral motion
 to dismiss the charge for lack of jurisdiction and in denying the
 State's motion for reconsideration. As explained below, we
 vacate the District Court's March 30, 2011, Judgment and remand
 for further proceedings.
 
We resolve the State's arguments on appeal as follows:
 1. The District Court erred in dismissing the abuse
 
of a family or household member charge with prejudice for lack of
 jurisdiction. Pursuant to HRS § 604-8(b) (Supp. 2012), the
 District Court clearly had jurisdiction over the abuse of a
 family or household member charge against Dela Cruz, which
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alleged an offense set forth in HRS § 709-906(1). HRS § 604-8
 
provides in relevant part:
 
(b) The district court shall have concurrent
 
jurisdiction with the family court of any violation of an
order issued pursuant to chapter 586 or any violation of
section 709-906 when multiple offenses are charged and at
least one other offense is a criminal offense within the
 jurisdiction of the district courts. 
(Emphasis added.) Here, the charge against Dela Cruz for abuse
 
of a family or household member, in violation of HRS § 709­906(1), was combined with other criminal offenses within the
 jurisdiction of the District Court. Accordingly, the District
 Court had concurrent jurisdiction over the abuse of a family or
 household member charge under HRS § 604-8(b), and it erred in
 dismissing the charge for lack of jurisdiction.
 
Dela Cruz does not dispute that the District Court had
 
jurisdiction over the abuse of a family or household member
 charge under HRS § 604-8(b). However, he argues that the State
 waived its challenge to the dismissal of the charge by failing to
 object to Dela Cruz's motion to dismiss. 
Under the plain error standard of review, we may
 
overlook a party's failure to object in the trial court and
 "correct errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or
 public reputation of judicial proceedings." State v. Fox
, 70
 
Haw. 46, 56, 760 P.2d 670, 676 (1988) (internal quotation marks
 and citation omitted). Here, the District Court dismissed the
 charge despite clear statutory authority conferring it with
 jurisdiction over the charge. The District Court compounded the
 error by dismissing the charge with prejudice, thereby precluding
 the State from pursuing any prosecution on the charge. Under the
 circumstances of this case, we conclude that it is appropriate to
 reach the State's challenge to the District Court's dismissal of
 the charge with prejudice under the plain error standard. We
 vacate the March 30, 2011, Judgment and remand the case for
 further proceedings.

2. Because the District Court's dismissal of the 
charge for lack of jurisdiction did not constitute an acquittal, 
there is no double jeopardy or statutory impediment to vacating the District Court's March 30, 2011, Judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings. See State v. Ake, 88 Hawai' i 389, 
392-94, 967 P.2d 221, 224-26 (1998); State v. Clemente, No. CAAP­11-0000027, (Hawai' i App. Nov. 30, 2012). 
3. Given our decision to vacate the March 30, 2011,
 
Judgment, we need not address whether the District Court erred in
 denying the State's motion for reconsideration.

We vacate the March 30, 2011, Judgment and remand the
 
case for further proceedings.

 In State v. Clemente, No. CAAP-11-0000027, (Hawai' i App. Nov. 30,
2012), this court held that except where barred by the protection against
double jeopardy, a district court has the power and jurisdiction to reconsiderthe dismissal of a charge with prejudice pursuant to HRS § 604-7(a)(3) (1993).We decline to decide in this case whether a district court has inherent powerbeyond the power conferred by HRS § 604-7(a)(3) to reconsider a dismissal of acharge with prejudice.
