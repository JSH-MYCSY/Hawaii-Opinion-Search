IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JEFFREY JOSEPH PLAUCHE,
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant,
v.
 
ELISA WATKINS PLAUCHE,
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 10-1-0070)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
On May 2, 2011 Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/
 
Appellant Jeffrey Plauche (Plauche) sought to appeal from the
 
February 9, 2011 Judgment Granting Divorce (February 9, 2011
 
Judgment) entered by the Family Court of the Second Circuit
 
(family court).1
 
In an order dated August 25, 2011, this court granted
 
in part and denied in part Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/
 
Appellee Elisa Watkins Plauche's (Elisa) motion to dismiss appeal
 
for lack of jurisdiction. We determined that this court lacks
 
jurisdiction to review the February 9, 2011 Judgment, but has
 
jurisdiction to the extent that Plauche seeks review of an

April 13, 2011 order denying Plauche's March 23, 2011  post-
judgment motion pursuant to Hawai' i Family Court Rules (HFCR) 
Rule 60(b) to set aside the February 9, 2011 judgment (April 13, 
2011 Order). 
Plauche raises the following points of error on appeal: 
(1)
 the family court abused its discretion by failing
 
to distribute the marital estate in a fair and equitable manner,
 and specifically by awarding Plauche securities in a Mexican
 
corporation;
 
(2) the family court abused its discretion by failing
 
to give its reasoning or rationale in its February 9, 2011
 
Judgment; 
(3) the family court abused its discretion by not
 
requiring Elisa to file her financial statements in a timely
 
manner and by failing to require Elisa to file her pre-trial
 
statement and settlement conference statement;
 
(4) the February 9, 2011 Judgment was contrary to an
 
October 18, 2010 minute order by the family court, which stated
 
that "[n]o agreement made as to Category three division value and
 
equalization payment, all other issues settled[,]" and the family
 
court ignored an agreement made by the parties as to the division
 
of property; and 
(5) both the family court and Elisa violated HFCR Rule
 
3
95  when they failed to send, within two days, a copy of the
February 9, 2011 Judgment to Plauche despite a statement by the
 court that it would send Plauche a copy of the judgment; the
 
family court further made the false statement that "the parties
 
believe the division of their personal property to be fair and
 
equitable"; and the February 9, 2011 Judgment improperly stated
 
2 While the family court file-stamped this document on March 24, 2011,
the effective date of this document is March 23, 2011, the date on which the
family court received the document. See Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai' i 144, 151, 44
P.3d 1085, 1092 (2002).

the unpaid balance owed to Plauche's sister as $58,000 instead of
 
$75,000, and recited an equalization payment of $54,513 without
 
any reasoning or justification.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised therein, we resolve
 
Plauche's appeal as follows.
 
Pursuant to this court's August 25, 2011 Order, we 
exercise jurisdiction over Plauche's appeal only to the extent 
that he seeks review of the family court's April 13, 2011 order 
denying Plauche's Rule 60(b) motion. We address Plauche's 
arguments to the extent that they relate to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) 
and/or Rule 60(b)(6), the only provisions of HFCR Rule 60(b) 
cited in Plauche's amended opening brief. The standard of review 
for the grant or denial of a HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) or 60(b)(6) 
motion is abuse of discretion. See Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 
125 Hawai' i 128, 139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011); Moyle v. Y & Y 
Hyup Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai' i 385, 402-03, 191 P.3d 1062, 1079-80 
(2008); De Mello v. De Mello, 3 Haw. App. 165, 169, 646 P.2d 409, 412 (1982). 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) and (6) state:
 
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud.  On motion and upon such terms
as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's
legal representative from any or all of the provisions of a
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
reasons: . . . (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; . . . (6) any other reason
justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The
 motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for
reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the
judgment, order or proceedings was entered or taken. . . .
 
Given that HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) is similar to Rule 
60(b)(3) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and Rule 
60(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), "the 
movant must, (1) prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 
verdict was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, or other 
3

misconduct [, and] (2) establish that the conduct complained of 
prevented the losing party from fully and fairly presenting his 
case or defense." Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 
Hawai'i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997) (citations omitted). 
With respect to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6), it is similar to
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) and thus the movant is required to "assert[]
 some ground for relief other than those specifically stated in
 
clauses (b)(1) through (b)(5)." Child Support Enforcement Agency
 
v. Doe, 98 Hawai' i 499, 504, 51 P.3d 366, 371 (2002) (citation 
omitted). Further, the rule "provides for extraordinary relief 
and is only invoked upon a showing of exceptional circumstances." 
Isemoto Contracting Co. v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 205, 616 
P.2d 1022, 1025 (1980) (citations omitted). 
The only discernable argument that Plauche makes in his
 
amended opening brief that relates to HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) or (6)
 
is his contention that the family court and Elisa both violated
 
4
HFCR Rule 97  by not serving him, within two days, with a copy of
the February 9, 2011 Judgment. 
With regard to this argument, we
 
conclude that the family court did not abuse its discretion in
 denying Plauche's HFCR Rule 60(b) motion.
 
HFCR Rule 97 provides that: 
Within 2 days after a judgment or order is filed in
any case, the attorney preparing the same shall mail or
deliver two certified copies of the judgment or order and
two copies of any agreements of the parties referred to
therein to the attorney for the other party in case such
party is represented by an attorney, or shall mail or
deliver a certified copy of the judgment or order and a copy
of such agreement to the other party at the other party's
last known address if the other party is not represented by
an attorney. Proof of mailing or delivery of the certified
copies of the judgment or order within the 2-day period to
the attorney for the other party or to the party shall be
made to the court forthwith. Failure to comply with this
rule may be considered as grounds for relief from the
judgment under Rule 60(b)(3) or 60(b)(6). 
(Emphasis added).

 As noted above, Plauche cites to HFCR 95 but appears to be referring
to HFCR Rule 97.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In his March 23, 2011 HFCR Rule 60(b) motion, Plauche
 
claimed that contrary to the family court's statements to him, he
 
did not receive a copy of the February 9, 2011 Judgment from the
 
court, that he had to obtain a copy of the judgment by going back
 
to the courthouse, and "was not able to obtain a copy of this
 
Order under approximately 30 days after the Judge had filed his
 
Order." In response to Plauche's allegations that he did not
 
timely receive a copy of the judgment, Elisa submitted an exhibit
 
that she claimed was the original envelope in which her attorney
 
mailed Plauche a copy of the judgment, postmarked February 10,
 
2011. According to Elisa's declaration, she shared the marital
 
residence with Plauche at the time, and saw the envelope after
 
Plauche apparently had opened it. Elisa's declaration further
 
stated that:
 
I also overheard [Plauche] about three weeks later,
complaining that supposedly he was never mailed the decree,
that he only learned that it was filed when he went to the
court and obtained a copy. At that point, I saved the
envelope that he had opened, postmarked February 10, 2011.
The original is attached as Exhibit A. I called my attorney
to ask for the deadline within which Jeffrey had to file an
appeal (March 14) and remembered thinking that I only had to
wait another week. He had to have gone to court about
March 9, 2011 to get an additional copy.
 
Elisa's counsel, Joy Yanagida, also submitted a declaration that
 
she had caused a certified copy of the February 9, 2011 Judgment
 
to be mailed to Plauche on February 10, 2011.
 
Based on the evidence in the record, the family court
 
did not abuse its discretion in denying Plauche's Rule 60(b)
 
motion. Although there was conflicting evidence, under HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(3), Plauche had the burden to prove that Elisa or her
 
counsel failed to comply with HFCR Rule 97 by clear and
 
convincing evidence, which he failed to do. Moreover, under HFCR
 
Rule 60(b)(6), Plauche did not make a showing of "exceptional
 
circumstances." See Isemoto Contracting Co., 1 Haw. App. at 205,
 
616 P.2d at 1025.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the family court's
 
April 13, 2011 post-judgment order denying Plauche's March 23,
 
2011 post-judgment HFCR Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the
 
February 9, 2011 judgment is affirmed.
