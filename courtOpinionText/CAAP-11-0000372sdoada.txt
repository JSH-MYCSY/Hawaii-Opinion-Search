IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
EASON I. HOLI, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0314)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
I.
 
Defendant-Appellant Eason I. Holi Jr. (Holi) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence (Judgment)
 
entered April 4, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). The circuit court convicted Holi of "Failure To
 Comply With Covered Offender Registration Requirements," (FCCORR)
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 846E-9 and
 
846E-9(b) (Supp. 2011).
 
When Holi filed his November 4, 2010 conditional guilty 
plea of FCCORR, he reserved his right under Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 11(a)(2) (2007) to seek appellate review of the denial of his August 30, 2010 Motion to Dismiss 
(Motion to Dismiss).

 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Holi contends the circuit court erred in
 
denying his Motion to Dismiss when the court (1) admitted
 
irrelevant, prejudicial evidence without foundation; (2)
 
considered that evidence, along with properly-admitted but
 
insufficient evidence, to determine Holi was a "covered offender"
 
based on his March 24, 1995 conviction (1995 Judgment); and (3)
 
retroactively applied the "covered offender" determination to
 
conclude that Holi was required to register as a convicted sex
 
offender for the period between April 14, 2004 through December
 
5, 2008. Holi also contends the circuit court erred when it
 
imposed Probation Condition Q to require that Holi comply with
 
the life time sex offender registration.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Holi's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
II.
 
In the 1995 Judgment, Holi was convicted under
 
HRS § 707-720, which provides that one is guilty of kidnapping if
 
the person restrains another person with intent to either (1)
 
"[i]nflict bodily injury upon that person" or (2) "subject that
 
person to a sexual offense." HRS § 707-720(1)(d) (1993). In his
 
Motion to Dismiss, Holi contended that HRS § 846E was vague and
 
overbroad because it was unclear that the statute applied to him. 
Holi argued that the "either/or" language of HRS § 707-720
 
created an ambiguity as to whether his kidnapping conviction was
 
for inflicting bodily harm or for committing a sexual offense.
 
A criminal statute is void for vagueness if "(1) a 
person of ordinary intelligence cannot obtain an adequate 
description of the prohibited conduct or how to avoid committing 
illegal acts, and (2) it encourages arbitrary and discriminatory 
enforcement[.]" State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 401, 245 P.3d 
458, 474 (2010) (internal quotation marks, citations, and 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
brackets omitted). A statute is overbroad if it "sweep[s] so 
broadly that constitutionally protected conduct as well as 
unprotected conduct is included in its proscriptions." State v. 
Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 32, 960 P.2d 1227, 1240 (1998). 
Additionally, "[p]enal statutes are to be strictly 
construed. However, the strict construction rule does not permit the court to ignore legislative intent, nor require the court to 
reject that construction that best harmonizes with the design of 
the statute or the end sought to be achieved." State v. Gaylord 
78 Hawai' i 127, 139, 890 P.2d 1167, 1179 (1995) (citation 
omitted). 
In 1997, two years after Holi's kidnapping conviction, 
the Hawai' i Legislature enacted HRS Chapter 846E, establishing 
the sex offender registration and notification program. State v. 
Bani, 97 Hawai' i 285, 292, 36 P.3d 1255, 1262 (2001). The 
chapter required, among other things, that persons convicted of sex crimes against children register a current address with state 
law enforcement officials and notify officials of any change of 
address. Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. § 14071 (1994 and Supp. 2003). 
The legislature explained that it was enacting the
 
statute because of "a compelling interest in protecting the
 public from sex offenders and in protecting children from
 
predatory sexual activity by requiring strict registration
 
requirements of sex offenders[.]" 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 316,
 
§ 1 at 749.
 
HRS § 846E-2(a) states that a person is required to
 
register if he is deemed a "covered offender." HRS § 846E-1
 
provides the following pertinent definitions:
 
•	 "Covered offender" means a "sex offender" or an
 
"offender against minors[.]"
 
•	 "Sex offender" means . . . [a] person who is or has
been convicted at any time, whether before or after May
9, 2005, of a "sexual offense[.]"
 
•	 "Sexual offense" . . . means an offense that is . . .
 [a]n act defined in section 707-720 if the charging
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
document for the offense for which there has been a
 
conviction alleged intent to subject the victim to a
sexual offense[.]
 
A covered offender is guilty of FCCORR under HRS § 846E-9 if the
 
person fails to register or fails to notify the appropriate
 
authorities of any changes in registration information.
 
For the statute not to be vague or overbroad, it must
 
be clear under HRS § 846E-1 that a person charged and convicted
 
for kidnapping under HRS § 707-720 must register if the intent of
 
his act was to subject a minor to a sexual offense, but not if
 
the intent was to inflict bodily harm.
 
When Holi was charged with kidnapping, the charging
 
document tracked the language of HRS § 707-720(1)(d) and alleged
 
that Holi "did intentionally or knowingly restrain [Minor] with
 
intent to inflict bodily injury upon her or subject her to a
 
sexual offense." HRS § 846E-1 states that a sexual offense is,
 
among other things, "[a]n act defined in section 707-720 if the
 
charging document for the offense for which there has been a
 
conviction alleged intent to subject the victim to a sexual
 
offense[.]" HRS § 846E-1 (emphasis added).
 
The circuit court correctly determined that 
HRS § 846E-l only imposes the registration requirement on persons 
charged under HRS § 707-720 where the charge includes the 
defendant's intent to subject the victim to a sexual offense and 
the defendant is subsequently convicted of such offense. To 
conclude that registration is required of those charged under the 
"either/or" language of HRS § 707-720 but subsequently only 
convicted of kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily injury goes 
against legislative intent and "require[s] the court to reject 
that construction that best harmonizes with the design of the 
statute or the end sought to be achieved." State v. Gaylord, 78 
Hawai'i 127, 139, 890 P.2d 1167, 1179 (1995) (citation omitted). 
We conclude that HRS § 846E defines "with sufficient
 
definiteness that ordinary people can understand" the offense of
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
failing to register as a sex offender when one has been convicted 
of a sex offense, and thus is not vague. Mita, 124 Hawai' i at 
401, 245 P.3d at 474. The statute is not overbroad because the requirement to register is clearly limited to sex offenders and 
does not require registration by those not convicted of a sex 
offense. See State v. Beltran, 116 Hawai' i 146, 152, 172 P.3d 
458, 464 (2007) (A regulation is overbroad if it sweeps so broadly that it criminalizes "innocent, constitutionally 
protected behavior as well as conduct which may be validly 
regulated[.]") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
III.
 
Holi contends the circuit court erred by admitting the 
Ho'ohiki court minutes of the 1995 sentencing hearing, the 1995 
presentence diagnosis and report (PSI) (1995 PSI), and the testimony of the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA) at the 
September 20, 2010 hearing on his Motion to Dismiss. Holi had 
objected to the evidence as irrelevant. 
Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 401 (1993) defines 
relevant evidence as "evidence having any tendency to make the 
existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination 
of the action more probable or less probable than it would be 
without the evidence." "The legitimate tendency to establish a 
controverted fact is all that is required in order that proffered 
evidence be relevant." State v. Irebaria, 55 Haw. 353, 356, 519 
P.2d 1246, 1249 (1974) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
To be required to register under HRS § 846E-9, Holi
 
must have been convicted of a sexual offense. At the September
 
20, 2010 hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the circuit court
 
identified the issue as "[w]hether or not the failure to comply
 
[with] cover[ed] offender registration applies to Mr. Holi, based
 
on Mr. Holi's prior conviction of kidnapping." The question
 
before the circuit court was whether or not Holi had pled to a
 
sex offense in his 1994 plea agreement. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Both parties stipulated to the fact that the
 
transcripts of the December 19, 1994 change of plea hearing and
 
the March 24, 1995 sentencing hearing were no longer available. 
Due to the lack of transcripts, it was necessary to look to other
 
means to establish what the factual basis had been for Holi's
 
change of plea. 
The Ho'ohiki court minutes, the testimony of the DPA 
who had prosecuted the kidnapping case, and the declaration by 
Holi in the 1995 PSI had the "legitimate tendency" to establish 
that Holi pled to kidnapping with the intent to subject Minor to 
a sexual offense. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in 
admitting the 1995 PSI and allowing the DPA to testify for the 
purpose of establishing the fact that the 1995 Judgment was for 
kidnapping with the intent to subject Minor to a sexual offense. 
According to HRPP Rule 11(f), the circuit court "shall
 
not enter a judgment upon [a guilty] plea without making such
 
inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the
 
plea." At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, Holi conceded
 
that "[t]here clearly was a factual basis" for his plea. On
 
appeal, Holi acknowledged that the kidnapping case had facts
 
supportive of both bodily injury and a sex offense but argued
 
that there was insufficient, properly-admitted evidence to show
 
he had "indisputably" been convicted of kidnapping with the
 
intent to subject Minor to a sexual offense. We disagree.
 
The DPA testified that at the time she was assigned to
 
the case against Holi, she was a member of the Prosecutor's
 
Office sex assault team, whose primary focus was sexual assault
 
cases. She stated that she remembered this case because "the
 
facts were horrific" and it was "the only natural father/daughter
 
case I have ever had where the perpetrator used a knife." She
 
testified that at the December 19, 1994 change of plea hearing,
 
she had placed a factual basis for the plea on the record,
 
namely, that Holi committed the act of kidnapping with the intent
 
to subject Minor to a sexual offense. She also testified that it
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
was not clear whether Holi had an intent to inflict a bodily 
injury on Minor, but "the intention to commit a sexual offense 
was crystal clear." Regarding the general practice of the judge 
who was sitting on the bench at the December 19, 2004 change of 
plea hearing, the DPA described her practice to be very thorough, 
to get a factual basis for the plea articulated, and to ask the 
defendant if he agreed with the factual basis. The DPA testified 
that the judge took a factual basis in this case, but the DPA 
acknowledged she could not remember whether the judge asked Holi 
if he agreed with the factual basis. The DPA also provided a 
declaration stating she had "placed a factual basis for the plea 
on the record and the factual basis contained facts supporting 
the element of the charge that [Holi] restrained [Minor] with the 
intent to subject her to a sexual offense." The Ho' ohiki court 
minutes from the December 19, 1994 change of plea hearing corroborate the DPA's testimony by indicating that a factual 
basis for the plea was placed on the record. 
Furthermore, attached to the State of Hawai' i's (the 
State) Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss 
was the Honolulu Police Department's "CID Closing Report." That 
document indicated the case was opened after Minor "disclosed 
that she was sexually abused by [Holi]." After Mother reported 
the incident to the police, Minor and her siblings were 
2
interviewed at the Children's Advocacy Center  (CAC), which
provides interview rooms to videotape interviews with children
 
who are alleged victims of sexual abuse. Much of the information
 
in the synopsis was gleaned from the interviews at CAC of Minor,
 
her siblings, and her mother.
 
2
 The Children's Advocacy Center, a program of the Hawai' i State 
Judiciary, was established by the legislature "to ensure a fair and neutral
process for the handling of reports of child sexual abuse." In 2001, thelegislature changed the name to the Hawai' i Children's Justice Center and 
"expanded the program's focus to include felony abuse and children aswitnesses." http://www.courts.state.hi.us/services/hawaii_childrens_justice_centers/about_the_justice_centers.html (last accessed July 11, 2012).

The synopsis detailed Holi's acts, all of which
 
indicated an intent to subject Minor to sexual offense.
 
The State also attached the Honolulu Police Department
 
Statement Form, in which Minor handwrote a description of what
 
happened to her, similar to what she stated in her interview. 
The circuit court took judicial notice of Holi's 1995
 
PSI, in which Holi admitted he had conducted most of the acts
 
Minor accused him of. The PSI also indicated that Holi agreed to
 
attend sex offender therapy, if ordered. The circuit court
 
remarked that it only looked at Holi's statement in the
 
presentence report and did not consider the police reports and
 
the rest of the presentence report.
 
There was no evidence presented to show that Holi had 
objected to the PSI at the 1995 sentencing hearing, other than 
his general denial of intent to subject Minor to a sexual 
offense. A defendant's failure to raise a "good faith challenge" 
to information contained in his PSI at sentencing constitutes the 
defendant's concession to and affirmative stipulation to the 
information contained within the PSI. State v. Heggland, 118 
Hawai'i 425, 440-41, 193 P.3d 341, 356-57 (2008). Holi's 
statements in the 1995 PSI were consistent with the DPA's 
recollection of the facts, as well as with Minor's police 
statement. 
Holi further objects that this evidence, even if
 
relevant, should have been excluded because its probative value
 
was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of
 
the issues, or misleading the court under HRE Rule 403. He also
 
objects to the admissions of his prior sex offender registration
 
records and argues that the registration records and the 1995 PSI
 
lacked foundation or were an exception to the hearsay rule. 
Insofar as these objections were made for the first time on
 
appeal, we do not address them. "[A]n issue raised for the first
 
time on appeal will not be considered by the reviewing court. 
Only where the ends of justice require it, and fundamental rights
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
would otherwise be denied, will there be a departure from these 
principles. " State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai' i 382, 410, 910 P.2d 
695, 723 (1996) (quoting State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980). We find no justification here. 
IV.
 
The circuit court did not "illegally" sentence Holi
 
when it imposed Probation Condition Q that Holi "[c]omply with
 
the life time sex offender registration [requirement]." Pursuant
 
to the factual basis to support the kidnapping conviction, the
 
circuit court found that Holi had pled to the offense of
 
kidnapping with intent to subject a minor to a sex offense. 
Thus, Holi was a sex offender and, therefore, a covered offender
 
required to register pursuant to HRS § 846E-2. The condition
 
that Holi comply with the life time registration requirement was
 
merely reiterating the requirement as provided under 
HRS § 846E-10.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence entered April 4, 2011 in the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit is affirmed.
