IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JASMINE K. LOPEZ, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-1654)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Ginoza, J.
with Fujise, J., dissenting separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jasmine K. Lopez (Lopez) appeals
 
from an "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence"1
 
entered on April 21, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the First
 
2 3
Circuit (circuit court).   Pursuant to a plea agreement,  Lopez 
 
plead guilty to violating Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C­
12.5 (2007) (Accidents Involving Substantial Bodily Injury).4
 
1
 Lopez filed for reconsideration pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 35. 
2
 At various points in this matter, the Honorable Michael A. Town,
Edwin C. Nacino, and Michael D. Wilson presided.
3
 The plea agreement allowed Lopez to plead to the lesser included
offense of Accidents Involving Substantial Bodily Injury, a class C felony,
instead of the charged offense of Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily
Injury, a violation of HRS § 291C-12 (2007), a class B felony. The parties
reached no agreement as to sentencing.

 HRS § 291C-12.5 provides in pertinent part:
§291C-12.5. Accidents involving substantial bodily
(continued...)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Lopez requested a deferred acceptance of guilty plea (DAG), which
 
was denied by the circuit court, both initially and on
 reconsideration. Lopez was sentenced to five (5) years probation
 subject to terms and conditions including, inter alia, a term of
 imprisonment of sixty (60) days and various fines and
 assessments.
 
On appeal, Lopez asserts that the circuit court erred
 
because it denied her a DAG on the incorrect basis that
 
5
HRS § 853-4(2)(A) (2012 Supp.)  precluded a DAG for the
HRS § 291C-12.5 offense.
 
During the course of this case, Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai 'i (State) has taken inconsistent positions as to 
whether Lopez is eligible for a DAG. The State did not initially contest Lopez's eligibility for a DAG. Subsequently, during proceedings on Lopez's motion to reconsider her request for a DAG, a new deputy prosecuting attorney appeared in the case and argued that HRS § 853-4(2)(A) precluded a DAG for the offense in this case. On appeal, the State has again reversed course, now taking the position that a DAG was not precluded by HRS § 853­4(2)(A). However, the State asserts, for the first time, that because the circuit court imposed sixty days of jail time, it would be "fundamentally inconsistent" to allow a DAG when one of the requirements for a DAG under HRS § 853-1(a) (1993) is that "[t]he ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require 
4(...continued)
injury. (a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an
accident resulting in substantial bodily injury to any
person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of
the accident or as close thereto as possible but shall then
forthwith return to and in every event shall remain at the
scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the
 requirements of section 291C-14. Every such stop shall be
made without obstructing traffic more than is necessary.
 
(b)
 Any person who violates subsection (a) shall be
guilty of a class C felony.
5
 HRS § 853-4(2)(A) was renumbered and is now HRS § 853-4(a)(2)(A),
effective as of April 25, 2013. 2013 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 53, §§ 1 and 4, at
94 and 96.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that the defendant shall presently suffer the penalty imposed by
 
law."
 
We conclude that Lopez's offense under HRS § 291C-12.5
 
is eligible for a DAG. We also conclude that the State's
 argument under HRS § 853-1(a), which was not raised in the
 circuit court, has been waived in this case and we need not
 address it.
 
However, because it is unclear from the record why the
 
circuit court denied Lopez's request for a DAG, we remand for
 further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
I. Proceedings Below
 
Pursuant to a plea agreement, Lopez plead guilty to
 
violating HRS § 291C-12.5. As part of her plea form filed on
 May 25, 2010, Lopez moved for a DAG.
 
At an August 24, 2010 hearing on Lopez's sentencing,
 
6
the circuit court  heard argument and engaged in a colloquy with
Lopez before accepting her guilty plea and sentencing her to
 inter alia probation and sixty days in jail to commence
 forthwith. The circuit court thereby implicitly denied Lopez's
 motion for a DAG, but also sua sponte invited Lopez to file a
 motion for reconsideration on the DAG and immediately scheduled a
 hearing for such a motion.
7 Lopez filed her Motion for
 
Reconsideration of Sentence (Motion for Reconsideration) pursuant
 to HRPP Rule 35 on November 10, 2010. 
On February 22, 2011, a hearing was held on Lopez's
 
Motion for Reconsideration and for a further review hearing.
8 At
 
this hearing, the court and the parties addressed a review report
 by Lopez's probation officer and there was lengthy discussion as
 to whether Lopez was abiding by the terms of her probation. Also
 
6
 The Honorable Michael A. Town presided.
 
7
 Judge Town also acknowledged that he would be retiring from the bench
effective October 1, 2010, and that this subsequent hearing would be held
before a different judge.
8
 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
at this hearing, the State questioned for the first time Lopez's
 
statutory eligibility for a DAG, asserting that a DAG was
 precluded by the plain language of HRS § 853-4(2)(A). After a
 discussion with counsel regarding Lopez's statutory eligibility
 for a DAG, the circuit court continued the matter to allow the
 parties to file briefs on the issue. Only Lopez filed further
 briefing.
 
On March 22, 2011, another hearing was held on Lopez's
 
Motion for Reconsideration and for a further review hearing. 
9
After argument by the parties, the circuit court  stated that it
would take the matter under advisement. The court also had this
 further discussion on the record:

 
THE COURT: Anything further, Mr. Choy? I'll let you
know by Friday.
 
MR. CHOY: Question, Judge, if the Court determines
there is statutory eligibility would we then have to argue
eligibility for this person or -­
THE COURT: You mean statutorily eligibility under the
deferral statute?
 
MR. CHOY: Right.
 
THE COURT: I'll let you know after I reach a
conclusion as to whether or not the deferral is legally
available. But I would be inclined to probably grant a
deferral if there was a legal basis for it.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On April 21, 2011, the circuit court issued an order
 
denying Lopez's Motion for Reconsideration. The order does not
 
indicate the basis for denying the Motion for Reconsideration and
 thus it is unclear if the court in fact determined that
 HRS § 853-4(2)(A) precluded a DAG for Lopez's HRS § 291C-12.5
 offense.
 
II. Standard of Review
 
This case requires us to determine the applicability of 
HRS § 853-4(2)(A) to a violation of HRS § 291C-12.5. Issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. Lingle v. Hawai
'i

Gov't Emps. Ass'n, 107 Hawai 'i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 
(2005).
 
III. Discussion
 
Lopez argues that the circuit court erred in denying
 
her Motion for Reconsideration because she is eligible for a DAG
 
under HRS § 853-1 (1993 and 2011 Supp.) and a DAG was not
 precluded under HRS § 853-4(2)(A). As noted earlier, the State
 now agrees that HRS § 853-4(2)(A) does not prevent Lopez from
 being eligible for a DAG, but instead argues that allowing a DAG
 would be inconsistent with the circuit court having sentenced
 Lopez to sixty days confinement given the requirements under
 HRS § 853-1.
 
We agree with the parties that HRS § 853-4(2)(A) does
 
not statutorily preclude a DAG for Lopez's HRS § 291C-12.5
 offense. HRS § 853-4(2)(A) states:
 
§853-4 Chapter not applicable; when.  This chapter
shall not apply when:
 
. . . .
 (2)	 The offense charged is:
 (A)	 A felony that involves the intentional, knowing,
or reckless bodily injury, substantial bodily
injury, or serious bodily injury of another
person[.]
 
(Emphasis added.) The felony in this case is the violation of
 
HRS § 291C-12.5, which states in pertinent part: 
§291C-12.5. Accidents involving substantial bodily
injury.  (a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an
accident resulting in substantial bodily injury to any
person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of
the accident or as close thereto as possible but shall then
forthwith return to and in every event shall remain at the
scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the
 requirements of section 291C-14.
 (Emphasis added.)
 
When construing a statute, 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature,
which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. And we
must read statutory language in the context of
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the entire statute and construe it in a manner
 
consistent with its purpose.
 
Lingle, 107 Hawai 'i at 183, 111 P.3d at 592 (quoting Guth v. 
Freeland, 96 Hawai 'i 147, 150, 28 P.3d 982, 985 (2001)); see 
HRS §§ 1-15, 1-16 (2009). 
In our view, HRS § 853-4(2)(A) is properly construed as 
precluding a DAG for a felony that involves "intentional, 
knowing, or reckless" conduct that causes "bodily injury, substantial bodily injury, or serious bodily injury." Stated another way, although the level of the injury is also important, HRS § 853-4(2)(A) encompasses felonies that involve the causing of the injury with the specified mens rea, i.e. "the intentional, knowing, reckless . . . injury . . . of another." Our interpretation is consistent with and supported by HRS § 853­4(1), the immediately preceding section, which precludes a DAG when "[t]he offense charged involves the intentional, knowing, reckless, or negligent killing of another person." Also consistent with our view, this court has previously held that, where an injury is caused by negligent conduct, HRS § 853-4(2)(A) did not apply. See Andrews v. State, 127 Hawai
'i 241, 277 P.3d 
335, No. 29951, 2012 WL 1764079, at *3 (App. May 17, 2012) (SDO) (holding that HRS § 853-4(2)(A) does not preclude a deferred acceptance of a no contest plea for the offenses of Negligent Injury In the First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-705 (1993) and Accidents Involving Death or Serious Bodily Injury in violation of HRS § 291C-12 (2007), because both offenses involved negligent serious bodily injury). 
In turn, HRS § 291C-12.5 does not require intentional, 
knowing or reckless conduct to have caused the substantial bodily injury referenced in that offense. Rather, it involves "an accident resulting in substantial bodily injury to any person[.]" (Emphasis added.) In State v. Chen, 77 Hawai
'i 329, 884 P.2d 392 
(App. 1994), this court construed HRS § 291C-12(a), which is identical with HRS § 291C-12.5(a), except that it involves "serious bodily injury" or "death" of a person. Pertinent to 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
this case, Chen explained that an offense under HRS § 291C-12(a)
 
does not require that the defendant's conduct caused the injury
 or death.
 
On the other hand, Count I called for proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that Defendant was "involved in an accident
 
resulting in death." Count I, then, did not necessitate
proof that "but for" Defendant's conduct, the death would
not have been caused, but only proof that the vehicle
Defendant was driving was a "vehicle involved in an accident
[which] result[ed] in injury ... or death."
HRS § 291C–12(a). On its face, the statute's express
language does not mandate that the defendant driver or his
vehicle "cause" the accident or "cause" injury or death, to
be considered "involved" in the requisite accident.
Accordingly, criminal liability under HRS § 291C–12(a) does
not require proof that the driver of a vehicle caused injury
to or death of a person, but only that the accident the
driver was involved in resulted in injury to or death of any
person.
 
77 Hawai 'i at 336, 884 P.2d at 399 (emphasis added). Chen 
further noted that "[t]he statutory language is broad, hinging 
criminal liability for failing to give information and to render aid on involvement in the incident." Id. at 337, 884 P.2d at 
400.
 
Because a defendant's conduct need not have caused the
 
"accident" or the "substantial bodily injury" under HRS § 291C­12.5, being "involved in an accident resulting in substantial
 bodily injury" is an attendant circumstance for the HRS § 291C­12.5 offense. See State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 392, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1179 (2009) ("[A]n attendant circumstance is essentially a circumstance that exists independently of the actor's conduct." (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). 
Therefore, given our interpretation of the statutes,
 
HRS § 853-4(2)(A) does not exclude Lopez from being eligible for
 a DAG for her HRS § 291C-12.5 offense.
 
Further, as noted above, we need not address the
 
State's most recent position, that in light of the circuit
 court's imposition of sixty days incarceration it would be
 "fundamentally inconsistent" to allow a DAG given the
 requirements for a DAG under HRS § 853-1(a). This argument was
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
not raised in the circuit court and has been waived in this case. 
Even assuming that it has not been waived, the State's argument
 lacks merit because HRS 853-1(b) permits a court to grant a DAG
 upon any of the conditions of probation specified in HRS § 706­624 (2011 Supp.), which may include a term of imprisonment not
 exceeding one year for a class C felony case. See HRS § 706­
624(2)(a).
 
Finally, as noted earlier, the basis for the circuit
 
court's denial of Lopez's Motion for Reconsideration is unclear
 from its order. During the various hearings, in addition to
 whether Lopez was statutorily eligible for a DAG, there was much
 discussion as to whether a DAG was appropriate for Lopez even if
 legally available. Thus, notwithstanding the circuit court's
 stated inclination at the March 22, 2011 hearing that the court
 would "probably grant a [DAG] if there was a legal basis for it,"
 we must remand for further proceedings.
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Order Denying
 
Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence entered on April 21, 2011
 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, and remand for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion.
