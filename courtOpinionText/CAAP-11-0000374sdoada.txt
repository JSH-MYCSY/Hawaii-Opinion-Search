IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI
'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOHN N. AMIRAL, Defendant-Appellant

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

'EWA DIVISION

(CASE NO. 1DTI-10-123021)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: Fujise and Leonard, JJ.,
with Nakamura, C.J., dissenting)

Defendant-Appellant John N. Amiral (Amiral) appeals 
from the April 12, 2011 Judgment entered by the District Court of 
the First Circuit, 
'Ewa Division (District Court).1 
Judgment was entered in favor of the State as to

Amiral's offense of Speeding, in violation of Hawaii Revised

Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-102(a)(1) (2007) arising from a notice of

traffic infraction issued by Officer Zenas Ondayog (Officer

Ondayog) to Amiral on July 26, 2010 for exceeding the speed

limit.

On appeal, Amiral challenges the admission of the laser

gun evidence and contends that the District Court erred in

failing to sustain his objections as to lack of foundation and

hearsay, where there was insufficient evidence of Officer

1

The Honorable Philip M. Doi presided.

Ondayog's (1) personal knowledge of "whether these tests were the

recommended manufacturer tests, or how the tests worked" or that

the laser gun was properly maintained or calibrated; and

(2) training; that is, whether it met the requirements of the
 
manufacturer or his training, along with his experience,

qualified him to operate the laser gun.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we

resolve Amiral's point of error as follows.

Sufficient foundation for admission of the laser gun 
reading requires evidence: (1) "[t]hat the [l]aser [g]un [w]as 
[t]ested [a]ccording [t]o [m]anufacturer [r]ecommended 
[p]rocedures[,]" State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 
1227, 1233 (2009) and (2) "whether the nature and extent of an officer's training in the operation of a laser gun meets the 
requirements indicated by the manufacturer[,]" Assaye, 121 
Hawai'i at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. The person proffering such 
foundational testimony should have personal knowledge of the 
manufacturer's recommendations for testing of the laser gun and 
of the laser gun testing according to said recommendations to 
overcome hearsay concerns, see Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213, 216 
P.3d at 1236 (analyzing the police officer's testimony consistent with State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai' i 343, 354 167 P.3d 336, 347 
(2007), where the "expert's 'personal knowledge' that was adduced through his testimony at trial was sufficient 'to establish that 
the GCMSs were in proper working condition'" (quoting Manewa, 115 
Hawai'i at 354, 167 P.3d at 347)). 
Officer Ondayog confirmed he received "a manual" of

"instructions for operating and maintaining the LTI 20/20"; that

he read those instructions; determined that "Laser Tech

International[,]" "the manufacturer of the laser that [he had]"

created those instructions. Officer Ondayog received training in

operating the laser in January, 2002, and obtained a refresher

course on November 4, 2010.

Officer Ondayog confirmed that he was trained according 
to the manufacturer's recommended procedures to test and operate 
the laser gun. According to Officer Ondayog, the instructions in 
the manual specified to test the LTI 20/20 to ensure it was 
working accurately and operating properly, and his training was 
based on those instructions from the manufacturer. Officer 
Ondayog described the four specified tests. Notwithstanding 
Amiral's contention that Officer Ondayog's training was deficient 
where he was unfamiliar with "the internal operation of the 
machine how it works", performing the four tests of the laser as 
stated in manufacturer's recommended procedures establishes 
sufficient training. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 212, 216 P.3d at 
1235 ("'there was an established manufacturer's procedure that could be conducted by the user to ensure that the [device was] in 
working order according to the manufacturer's specifications.'") 
quoting Manewa 115 Hawai' i at 354, 167 P.3d at 347 and Manewa, 
115 Hawai' i at 348, 167 P.3d at 341 (expert testified each 
morning a "routine check on [the device] to ensure that all the 
parameters are within the manufacturer specification" was 
conducted). 
With regard to Officer Ondayog's experience in using

the laser gun, the officer estimated he had used that laser gun

on "hundreds of vehicles, maybe thousands."

Officer Ondayog confirmed that on the date in question

he performed the four tests in accordance with LTI's recommended

procedures prior to stopping Amiral. Based on the four tests,
 
Officer Ondayog confirmed that "[e]verything was working, good

working condition." Officer Ondayog also confirmed that he
 
operated the laser in accordance with his training and the

manufacturer's recommended procedure.

In light of the foregoing, Officer Ondayog's testimony

was sufficient to establish that "the nature and extent of

[Officer Ondayog's] training in the operation of a laser gun

meets the requirements indicated by the manufacturer." Assaye,

at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. This situation differs from that in

State v. Gonzalez,  128 Hawai' i 314, 327, 288 P.3d 788, 801 
(2012), where 
the record is silent as to what type of training is
recommended by the manufacturer. Without a showing as tothe manufacturer's recommendations, the court could notpossibly have determined whether the training received byOfficer Franks met "the requirements indicated by the
manufacturer." [Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 215, 216 P.3d at
1238.] 
Officer Ondayog's testimony is also consistent with the 
personal knowledge of the chemist in Manewa, who testified that 
he tested the device and determined that "the parameters are 
within manufacturer's specification[s,]" upon which the Assaye 
court relied in stating that the "expert's 'personal knowledge' 
that was adduced through his testimony at trial was sufficient 
'to establish that the GCMSs were in proper working condition.'" 
121 Hawai' i at 213, 216 P.3d at 1236 quoting Manewa, at 354, 167 
P.3d at 347. 
While Officer Ondayog testified that he never had the 
gun maintained or calibrated by the manufacturer where evidence of the manufacturer's recommended procedures exists by means of 
the officer's personal knowledge of the contents of the manual 
reflecting those recommended procedures, Assaye finds no hearsay 
violation (see Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213-14, 216 P.3d at 1236-37 
(in part quoting Manewa, at 354, 167 P.3d at 347, and in part citing cases from other jurisdictions that involved testing of 
the laser in accordance with procedures recommended by the 
manufacturer)). In the context of its calibration analysis, the 
Assaye court discussed evidence of accepted procedures and cited 
with approval cases from other jurisdictions that involved 
testing of the laser in accordance with procedures recommended by 
the manufacturer. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213-14, 216 P.3d at 
1236-37. The Assaye majority did not require any further showing of inspection and service by the manufacturer. 
Consequently, reviewing the District Court's ruling on 
Amiral's objection as to foundation for abuse of discretion, 
Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 210, 216 P.3d at 1233 in the light most

favorable to the prosecution, State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai' i 60, 69,

436, 442, 121 P.3d 901, 907 (2005)), Amiral's contention that the 
District Court erred cannot be sustained. 
Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on April 12, 2011 in the District Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division,
