Defendants-Appellants Herbert Albert Watson (Herbert)
 
and Bernadette Watson (Bernadette) (collectively, the Watsons)

 (Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration), which was filed in

the District Court of the Second Circuit (District Court)1 on

I.
 
On June 16, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellee The Bank of New 
York Mellon, as Trustee for the Cerficateholders CWALT, Inc. 
Alternative Loan Trust 2005-37T1, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-37TI (The Bank of New York Mellon) filed a "Verified Complaint for Ejectment" against the Watsons. The Bank of New York Mellon alleged that it was the fee simple owner of the subject property pursuant to a non-judicial foreclosure sale held on February 19, 2010, and the subsequent filing on April 13, 2010, of a Quitclaim Deed in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the State of Hawai' i, which named The 
Bank of New York Mellon as the "Grantee." The complaint alleged that the Watsons were wrongfully occupying the property and prayed for the entry of a Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession in favor of The Bank of New York Mellon. 
The Watsons were served with the complaint on June 21,
 
2010. At the return hearing held on July 12, 2010, Herbert
 appeared and entered a general denial, but Bernadette did not
 appear and the District Court entered default against her. At
 the return hearing, the District Court ordered Herbert to file a
 written motion with an attached affidavit setting forth the
 source of his title to the subject property and to serve the
 motion upon The Bank of New York Mellon by July 16, 2010. The
 District Court set a hearing date of July 26, 2010, for the
 motion.

 The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided over the proceedings
relevant to this appeal.

 In its answering brief, The Bank of New York Mellon argues that the
Watsons' opening brief should be stricken for failure to comply with Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 (2010). We deny The Bank of New
York Mellon's request to strike the Watsons' opening brief. We note that on March 21, 2012, this court issued an Order to Show Cause to the Watsons'counsel regarding counsel's failure to comply with HRAP Rules 28 and 32. We will address the issue of the noncompliance of the Watsons' brief with theHRAP in connection with the Order to Show Cause.

Herbert did not file a motion or affidavit setting
 
forth his source of title to the subject property as directed by
 
the District Court, and the Watsons did not appear at the hearing
 held by the District Court on July 26, 2010. On August 17, 2010,
 The Bank of New York Mellon filed a "Motion for Summary Judgment
 for Ejectment and Writ of Possession" (Motion for Summary
 Judgment). On September 10, 2010, the District Court held a
 hearing on The Bank of New York Mellon's Motion for Summary
 Judgment. Counsel for The Bank of New York Mellon appeared at
 the hearing, but the Watsons did not. The District Court orally
 granted The Bank of New York Mellon's Motion for Summary
 Judgment. On September 15, 2010, the District Court issued a
 Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession in favor of The
 Bank of New York Mellon. On September 27, 2010, the District
 Court filed its written order granting The Bank of New York
 Mellon's Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
On September 30, 2010, the Watsons, through counsel,
 
filed and served their "First Amended Motion for Reconsideration
 of Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession" (Motion for
 
3
Reconsideration),  pursuant to District Court Rules of Civil
Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 59 (1996).4 After a hearing held on March
 
18, 2011, the District Court denied the Watsons' Motion for
 Reconsideration. The District Court filed its written Order
 Denying Motion for Reconsideration on April 7, 2011, and this
 appeal followed.
 
II.
 
On appeal, the Watsons contend that the District Court
 
erred in issuing the Judgment for Possession and Writ of
 
3
 Although this pleading was entitled "First Amended Motion," the record
does not reflect a previous filing of a motion for reconsideration by the
Watsons.

 The Watsons' Motion for Reconsideration actually referred to Rule 59
of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). However, because this was a
district court proceeding, the applicable rule was DCRCP Rule 59, and we willtreat the Watsons' reference to HRCP Rule 59 as a reference to DCRCP Rule 59.

Possession and in denying the Watsons' Motion for
 
Reconsideration. The Watsons assert numerous arguments
 challenging the non-judicial foreclosure sale and the District
 Court's grant of The Bank of New York Mellon's Motion for Summary
 Judgment. 
At the outset, we address the question of whether we 
have jurisdiction over the Watsons' appeal. In order to appeal from the Judgment for Possession, the Watsons were required to file a notice of appeal within 30 days after the entry of the Judgment for Possession. Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) (2009). A timely motion to reconsider, alter, or amend the judgment under DCRCP Rule 59 would extend the deadline for filing the notice of appeal until thirty days after entry of the order disposing of the motion; "provided, that the failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the motion." HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2009). 
Here, the Watsons' Motion for Reconsideration was
 
untimely as a DCRCP Rule 59 motion because it was served more
 than 10 days after the Judgment for Possession was entered. See
 
DCRCP Rule 59. Moreover, even if the Motion for Reconsideration
 had been timely under DCRCP Rule 59, it would have been deemed
 denied on December 29, 2010, 90 days after it was filed. See
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). The Watsons did not file their notice of
 appeal until May 9, 2011. Therefore, the Watsons' appeal from
 
5
the Judgment for Possession was untimely  and their appeal from
the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration was also untimely,
 if that motion is construed as a DCRCP Rule 59 motion. 
We lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over appeals that are not timely filed.

 We note that the District Court reissued a Judgment for Possession on
April 21, 2011. However, the reissued Judgment for Possession did not amend
the originally issued Judgment for Possession in any material or substantialrespect and thus did not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. See 
Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Board, 98 Hawai' i 416, 418-19, 49 P.3d 382, 384Â­
85 (2002).

However, the Watsons' appeal from the Order Denying 
Motion for Reconsideration would be a timely appeal of a post-
judgment order, if their Motion for Reconsideration were construed as a motion seeking relief under DCRCP Rule 60(b) (2006). Assuming arguendo that we are able to regard the Watsons' Motion for Reconsideration as raising claims under DCRCP Rule 60(b)(1), (2), and (6), we conclude that the Watson's appeal is without merit. We review the trial court's denial of such claims for abuse of discretion. Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. 
Casey, 98 Hawai' i 159, 164, 45 P.3d 359, 364 (2002). 
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, The Bank 
of New York Mellon presented evidence establishing that it had obtained title to the subject property through a non-judicial foreclosure. This included authenticated copies of a "Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of Sale" and a "Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed" that were filed in the Land Court of the State of Hawai' i. The Watsons did not file any opposition to 
the Motion for Summary Judgment. Based on the evidence and arguments presented in support of the Motion for Summary Judgment, the District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of The Bank of New York Mellon and ordered the issuance of a Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession. See DCRCP Rule 
56(c), (e) (1997). 
With respect to their Motion for Reconsideration, the
 
Watsons did not establish that they were entitled to any relief
 on their request to set aside the Judgment for Possession and the
 order granting The Bank of New York Mellon's Motion for Summary
 Judgment. The Watsons did not demonstrate their entitlement to
 relief based on: (1) mistake or excusable neglect; (2) newly
 discovered evidence; or (3) any other valid reason. See DCRCP
 
Rule 60(b)(1), (2), and (6). In addition, 
"the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow the
parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could
not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated
motion." Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding.

Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai' i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000) 
(brackets, footnote, and citations omitted). 
In their Motion for Reconsideration, the Watsons did 
not present new evidence or arguments that could not have been 
presented during the adjudication of The Bank of New York Mellon's Motion for Summary Judgment. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Watsons' Motion for Reconsideration. See Beneficial Hawai' i, 98 
Hawai'i at 164, 45 P.3d at 364; Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki 
Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114-15, 839 P.2d 10, 27 (1992); Standard Management, Inc. v. Kekona, 98 Hawai' i 95, 98-101, 43
