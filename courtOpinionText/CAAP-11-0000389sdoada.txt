CAAP. NO. 11-0000389
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
THOMAS J. MCCARTHY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-05369)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Thomas J. McCarthy (McCarthy)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and/or
 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment) entered on April 12, 2011, in the Ewa
 
Division of the District Court of the First Circuit (District
 Court).
1
 
McCarthy was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) (Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, McCarthy contends that the District Court
 
erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the OVUII charge in
 
the complaint against him because it failed to allege the
 
requisite mens rea and, therefore, erred when it convicted him
 
based on stipulated facts.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve McCarthy's point of error as follows:
 
In State v. Nesmith, ___ Hawai' i ___, 276 P.3d 617 
(2012), the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that: (1) mens rea must 
be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause 
of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not be alleged (or 
proven) in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). 
Thus, McCarthy's HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was
 
deficient for failing to allege mens rea.
 
However, the District Court adjudged McCarthy guilty of 
violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). Subsections 
(a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as a basis for conviction under 
HRS § 291E-61. Nesmith, ___ Hawai' i at ___, 276 P.3d at ___. 
Given that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, and McCarthy does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence 
related thereto, his conviction stands. 
For these reasons, the District Court's April 12, 2011
 
Judgment is affirmed.
