appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment) filed on April 7, 2011 in the District
 
Court of the First Circuit, Wahiaw
â Division (District Court).1

 The Honorable David Lo presided.

(Supp. 2011).2 The District Court found Giannadakis guilty as
 
charged. 
On appeal, Giannadakis contends that the District Court
 
erred in denying his "Motion to Dismiss [Re: Failure to Allege an
 
Essential Fact]" (Motion to Dismiss), filed on May 6, 2010, in
 
which he argued that the complaint was deficient for failing to
 
allege that he committed the OVUII offense intentionally,
 
knowingly, or recklessly. The District Court issued its order
 
denying the Motion to Dismiss on April 7, 2011. Giannadakis
 
further contends that because his Motion to Dismiss was
 
improperly denied, the District Court erred in convicting him.
 
In State v. Nesmith, Nos. SCWC-10-0000072, SCWC-30438, 
2012 WL 1648974 (Haw. April 12, 2012), the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
recently held that: (1) mens rea must be alleged in a charge 
asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) in order to provide 
fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation; and 
(2) mens rea need not be alleged (or proven) in a charge
 
asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), because the
 
legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. Nesmith, 2012 WL
 
1648974; see also State v. Yamahata, No. SCWC-30718, 2012 WL
 1571382 (Haw. May 3, 2012) (SDO); State v. Flynn, No. SCWC-10­
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provides as follows:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
. . . 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

0000245, 2012 WL 1560666 (Haw. May 1, 2012) (SDO); State v.
 
Daniels, No. SCWC-10-0000243, 2012 WL 1560656 (Haw. April 30,
 
2012) (SDO); State v. Shinsato, No. SCWC-30720, 2012 WL 1560663
 
(Haw. April 30, 2012) (SDO); State v. Padilla, No. SCWC-30719,
 
2012 WL 1560660 (Haw. April 30, 2012) (SDO).
 
Accordingly, the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was
 
deficient for failing to allege mens rea.
 
The District Court, however, adjudged Giannadakis
 
guilty of violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). 
Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as a basis for 
conviction under HRS § 291E-61. Nesmith, 2012 WL 1648974 at *14. 
Given that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, and
 Giannadakis does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as
 
to that basis, his conviction stands.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the District Court's Judgment
 
entered on April 7, 2011 is affirmed.
