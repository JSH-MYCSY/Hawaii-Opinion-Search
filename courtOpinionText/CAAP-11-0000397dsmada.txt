IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JOHN MARYNAIK,
Claimant/Appellant-Appellant
v. 
J.P. SCHMIDT, Insurance Commissioner,
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, State of Hawaii,
Appellee-Appellee,
and
 
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES INSURANCE COMPANY,
Respondent/Appellee-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2629)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Claimant/Appellant/Appellant
 
John Marynaik (Appellant Marynaik) has asserted from the
 Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's December 16, 2010 (the December 16,
 2010 judgment), because Appellant Marynaik's appeal is untimely
 under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP).
 
The December 16, 2010 judgment is an appealable
 
judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-15
 (1993), HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2010, and HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 &
 
1Supp. 2010). Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),  Appellant Marynaik
1
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
extended the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for
 
filing a notice of appeal from the December 16, 2010 judgment
 
when Appellant Marynaik filed his December 27, 2010 motion for
 reconsideration of the December 16, 2010 judgment within ten
 
2 3
days after entry of the December 16, 2010 judgment, as Rule 59
of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) required. 
However, when a party files a timely tolling motion 
that extends the time period for filing a notice of appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), "[t]he rule provides that the court has 90 days to dispose of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . , regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." Buscher v. Boning
, 114 Hawai' i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 
(2007). When "the court fail[s] to issue an order on [the movant]'s [post-judgment tolling] motion by . . . ninety days after [the movant has] filed the [post-judgment tolling] motion, the [post-judgment tolling] motion [i]s deemed denied." County 
of Hawai' i v. C&J Coupe Family Limited Partnership, 119 Hawai' i 
352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008). 
The ninetieth calendar day after the December 27, 2010
 
filing date of Appellant Marynaik's motion for reconsideration
 was Sunday, March 27, 2011, and, thus, HRAP Rule 26(a) extended
 the ninety-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for
 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
(Emphases added).

 The tenth calendar day after December 16, 2010, was Sunday,
December 26, 2010, and, thus, Rule 6(a) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) extended the ten-day time period under HRCP Rule 59 untilMonday, December 27, 2010.

 HRCP Rule 81(e) requires that the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
"shall apply to any proceedings in a circuit court pursuant to appeal to thecircuit court from a governmental official or body (other than a court),except as otherwise provided in Rule 72."

adjudicating this motion until Monday, March 28, 2011. 
Therefore, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), Appellant Marynaik's
 December 27, 2010 motion for reconsideration was automatically
 deemed denied at the end of the day on March 28, 2011. Although
 the circuit court entered an April 11, 2011 written order
 purporting to deny the motion for reconsideration, the deemed
 denial rendered the April 11, 2011 written order a nullity. 
Consequently, the deemed denial triggered the thirty-day time
 period for filing a notice of appeal. The thirtieth day after
 March 28, 2011, was Wednesday, April 27, 2011. Appellant
 Marynaik did not file his May 10, 2011 notice of appeal by
 April 27, 2011, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) required for a timely
 appeal. Therefore, Appellant Marynaik's appeal is untimely under
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently,
 we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP­
11-0000397 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
