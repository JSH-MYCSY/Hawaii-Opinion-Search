In Cr. No. 95-0-1742, Halloran pled no contest to
 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree and was sentenced to

 to be served concurrently with any other term being served.
 
In Cr. No. 96-1-1310, Halloran was found guilty of
 
Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree. Halloran was
 sentenced to an indeterminate twenty-year term of incarceration. 
The Circuit Court granted the State's Motion for Sentencing as a

 years and eight months.

Halloran appealed his conviction for Attempted Sexual
 
Assault in the First Degree. On appeal in S.C. No. 21052,
 
Halloran raised three points of error: (1) ineffective
 assistance of trial counsel; (2) abuse of discretion by the
 Circuit Court in denying his motion for new trial; and (3) error
 by the Circuit Court in granting the State's Motion for
 Sentencing as a Repeat Offender. After an opening brief was
 filed, his appellate counsel filed a motion to amend opening
 brief. Appellate counsel stated:
 
2. The appellant has informed me that there are
additional issues not included in his opening brief which he
considers to be relevant to his appeal. Both pertain to the
question of whether appellant was denied effective
assistance of counsel, in that 1) the foreman of the jury
which convicted appellant was never questioned during the
voir dire examination of the prospective jurors by either
defense counsel or the prosecutor, so that appellant's right
to be tried by an impartial jury was encumbered by his
attorney's failure to take that action necessary to protect
appellant's constitutional right, and 2) that defense
counsel refused to file a motion to dismiss the charge under
HRPP Rule 48, even though appellant believes he was entitled
to a dismissal and requested his attorney to file for a
dismissal.
 
Halloran's motion was denied.  Halloran's conviction
 
was affirmed by this court in a summary disposition order dated
 
October 30, 1998.
 
On April 14, 1999, Halloran filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (First Petition), pursuant to Rule 40 of the 
Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) and the case was docketed 
as S.P.P. 99-0-0008. On May 5, 2000, the Circuit Court issued an 
Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief on the grounds that Halloran's claims were patently frivolous. On March 22, 2004, in S.C. No. 23478, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i affirmed 
the denial of Halloran's First Petition. 
On September 29, 2010, Halloran filed a Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody (Second Petition), pursuant to HRPP Rule 40.
 
Halloran alleged two grounds for relief: (1) denial of parole
 
due to Department of Public Safety's refusal to allow him to
 enter sex offender treatment; and (2) ineffective assistance of
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
counsel for failure to have the charge dismissed pursuant to HRPP
 
Rule 48 based on his right to a speedy trial.
 
Halloran stated that:
 
On May 26, 2000 I received a letter from Dr. Barry
Coyne of the Department of Public Safety ("DPS"),
inviting me to fill out the application for
participation in the DPS sex offender treatment
("SOT") program. Dr. Coyne informed me that
participation in this program was "typically required"
by the Parole Board prior to release on parole. I
 completed the application packet on June 5, 2000.
 
On July 5, 2000 I received a letter from Dr. Coyne
indicating that he had received my completed packet.
However, based on my denial that I had committed the
sexual offense, Dr. Coyne stated ". . . . you are not
eligible to enter SOTP because we do not know whether
you can take responsibility for your behavior that
brought you to prison, or whether you have a problem
we can treat."
 
On May 27, 2003 I appeared before the Parole Board for
a Parole hearing. My parole was denied because I had
not completed SOTP.
 
On May 26, 2004, May 24, 2005, May 22, 2006, May 23,
2007, June 5, 2008, and May 18, 2009 I appeared before
the Parole Board for a Parole hearing for parole
consideration. Each time my parole was denied because
I had not completed SOTP.
 
In May 2010 I appeared before the Parole Board for a
parole consideration hearing. At that time I informed
 the Board that since 2000 I had been attempting to
enter the DPS sex offender treatment program, but had
been denied entry by Dr. Barry Coyne. I requested
that the Board either facilitate my entry into SOTP,
or waive the SOTP requirement as my failure to
complete SOTP was due to Dr. Coyne's refusal to let me
enter the program and not because I was unwilling or
unable to participate in SOTP in order to receive
parole. The parole board denied my request to
facilitate my entry into the DPS SOTP and denied my
parole, again informing me it is their "policy" that
inmates convicted of sexual offenses must enter and
 complete the SOTP in order to gain release on parole.
 
Due to Dr. Coyne's refusal to allow me to enter the
program, I [will not] be able to fulfill the Board's
SOTP requirement. I want to emphasize that I have
always indicated that I am willing to participate in
SOTP, however, I cannot admit to committing an offense
that I did not commit. As a result, I will never be
granted parole, . . . I believe that the actions of
 Dr. Barry Coyne, the DPS and the Hawaii Paroling
Authority are in direct violation of the spirit and
holding of the ICA in State v. Reyes, 93 Hawaii 321
(2000).
 
Halloran also contended that the Circuit Court informed
 
his trial counsel that all he needed to do was file a simple
 
3
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion to dismiss the case based upon a violation of Halloran's
 
right to speedy trial within 180 days, and it would be granted.
 
Halloran claimed that he questioned his trial counsel about
 
filing the motion but his trial counsel responded that he had
 failed to file the motion and there was nothing counsel could do
 about it. Halloran claimed this demonstrated ineffective
 assistance of trial counsel. However, Halloran also stated,
 "This issue of a speedy trial is something which was discussed
 many times prior to the filing of my appeal, which was filed
 prior to my knowledge of what it contained." Halloran claimed
 that he wanted appellate counsel to raise the issue in his reply
 brief but appellate counsel stated that no reply brief would be
 filed because the State's answering brief was so bad it was not
 needed. Halloran claimed that this demonstrated ineffective
 assistance of appellate counsel. 
On February 16, 2011, in response to the State's Answer 
to the Second Petition, Halloran filed a Reply Brief to Prosecutor's Answer to Rule 40 Petition.  Halloran clarified his 
claim, citing State v. Reyes, 93 Hawai
'i 321, 2 P.3d 725 (App. 
2000), stating that requiring him to admit responsibility for the 
offense he was convicted of in order to complete the sex offender treatment program violated his Fifth Amendment Right against self-incrimination. 
On April 4, 2011, the Circuit Court issued its Order
 
Denying Relief, which denied the relief requested in the Second
 Petition. Halloran timely filed this appeal.
 
On this appeal, Halloran asserts: (1) citing Reyes,
 
that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was
 violated when he was denied parole for failing to complete a sex
 offender treatment program which required him to admit
 responsibility for the offense for which he was convicted; (2)
 his right to a speedy trial, pursuant to HRPP Rule 48 was
 violated; and (3) his trial and appellate counsel were
 ineffective for failing to have the case dismissed based upon the
 HRPP Rule 48 violation.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant rules, statutes, and case law, we resolve
 Halloran's points of error as follows: 
(1) To establish a Fifth Amendment claim, a defendant
 
must prove two things: "(1) that the testimony desired by the
 government carried the risk of incrimination, . . . . and (2)
 that the penalty he suffered amounted to compulsion." United
 
States v. Antelope, 395 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing
 Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 435 n.7 (1984); Lefkowitz v.
 Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 806 (1977)). Halloran cannot
 demonstrate that the testimony sought by the State as part of the
 sex offender treatment program carried the risk of incrimination. 
Neal v. Shimoda, 131 F.3d 818, 832-33 (9th Cir. 1997). Further,
 the denial of parole does not amount to compulsion under any
 reasonable test. McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 54 (2002);
 
Ainsworth v. Stanley, 317 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2002), cert.
 denied 538 U.S. 999 (2003); United States v. Johnson, 446 F.3d
 272, 280 (2d Cir. 2006), cert. denied 549 U.S. 953 (2006); Roman
 v. DiGuglielmo, 675 F.3d 204, 213-15 (3d Cir. 2012), cert. denied
 133 S. Ct. 287 (2012); Gwinn v. Awmiller, 354 F.3d 1211, 1225-26
 (10th Cir. 2004), cert. denied 543 U.S. 860 (2004).
 
(2) It appears that Halloran was aware of his right to
 
a speedy trial because he discussed it with both his trial and
 appellate counsel. He was also aware that his trial counsel and
 appellate counsel did not raise the issue at trial or on appeal. 
Halloran did not raise the issue in his First Petition despite
 being cognizant of the issue. Halloran has not established the
 existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure
 to raise the issue in his First Petition. Therefore, the claims
 are waived and relief is not available pursuant to HRPP Rule
 40(a)(3).
