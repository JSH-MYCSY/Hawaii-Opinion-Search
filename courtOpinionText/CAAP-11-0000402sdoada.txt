operating a motor vehicle without proof of liability insurance,

Omara raises the following points on appeal:
 
(1) The circuit court erred when it granted the
State's motion in limine, which precluded Omara
from raising the defense of lack of jurisdiction
based on the existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom.
 
(2) The circuit court erred when it granted the
State's motion to strike Omara's witnesses who
 were intended to establish the existence of the
 Hawaiian Kingdom in support of the defense of lack
of jurisdiction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Omara's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err when it granted the 
State's motion in limine. Persons claiming to be citizens of the 
Kingdom of Hawai' i are not exempt from the laws of the State of 
2(...continued) 
fewer occupants, and trucks and vans having a
gross vehicle weight rating of fifteen thousandpounds or less; and 
(4) All of the motor vehicles in category (3) andany vehicle that is not a commercial motorvehicle. 
HRS § 286-102. 
3 HRS § 431:10C-104 reads in pertinent part:
 
(a) Except as provided in section 431:10C-105, no
person shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public
street, road, or highway of this State at any time unless
such motor vehicle is insured at all times under a motor
 vehicle insurance policy.
 
(b) Every owner of a motor vehicle used or operated
at any time upon any public street, road, or highway of this
State shall obtain a motor vehicle insurance policy upon
such vehicle which provides the coverage required by this
article and shall maintain the motor vehicle insurance
 policy at all times for the entire motor vehicle
registration period.

Hawai'i. State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 
664 (App. 2004). 
Whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of the
Provisional Government in 1893, the Republic of Hawai' i in 
1894, and the Territory of Hawai' i in 1898, the State of
Hawai'i was, . . . and is now, a lawful government. As 
noted by this court in State v. French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 231­
32, 883 P.2d 644, 653-54 (App. 1994), the State of Hawai' i 
has lawful jurisdiction over all persons operating motorvehicles on public roads or highways within the State ofHawai'i. Persons claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom of
Hawai'i and not of the State of Hawai' i are not exempt from
the laws of the State of Hawai' i applicable to all persons
(citizens and non-citizens) operating motor vehicles onpublic roads within the State of Hawai' i. 
Id.
 
(2) The circuit court did not err in granting the 
State's motion to strike defense witnesses who would have 
testified regarding the existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom. 
Whether Omara could establish the existence of the Kingdom of 
Hawai'i was not relevant to a fact of consequence to the case 
because Omara is still subject to the traffic laws of the State of Hawai' i. Id. As Omara's witnesses would have testified 
solely on the subject of his sovereignty defense and irrelevant evidence is not admissible under Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 
402, the circuit court did not err in granting the State's motion 
to prevent these witnesses from testifying at trial. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the April 14, 2011 Judgment
 
of Conviction and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the
 Third Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 5, 2012.
