NO. CAAP-11-0000414
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
' OF THE STATE OF HAWAII
 
ROY HASHIMOTO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
COUNTY OF KAUAI, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0028 JKW)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant Roy
 
Hashimoto (Appellant) has asserted from following two orders that
 the Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe entered:
 
(1)	 an April 28, 2011 "Order Granting Defendant County of
Kaua'i's Motion to Dismiss Complaint Filed February 9,
2011, Filed on March 10, 2011"; and 
(2)	 an April 28, 2011 "Order Granting Defendant County ofKaua'i's Motion to Render Judgment in Accordance to
the Decisions of the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations Filed on March 22, 2011[.]" 
As explained below, the circuit court has not yet reduced these 
two orders to a separate judgment document that resolves all claims against all parties in this case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright,
 76 Hawai' i 115 119, NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
promulgated HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. The separate judgment must 
"either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment 
in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339 (footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 
Hawai'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; 
emphasis added). For example, in Jenkins, the Supreme Court of Hawai'i dismissed an appeal from orders granting defendants' 
motions to dismiss a complaint and an amended complaint, because the circuit court had not yet reduced the dismissal orders to a 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
separate judgment. Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 117, 869 P.2d at 1336. 
In another case involving a dismissal, the Supreme Court of 
Hawai'i explained that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding 
dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii 
Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) 
(emphases added). 
Neither of the two April 28, 2011 orders is a judgment,
 
and the circuit court has not yet reduced the two April 28, 2011
 orders to a separate judgment, as HRCP Rule 58 requires. On
 July 18, 2011, the record on Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000414 was
 filed, at which time the record on appeal did not contain a
 separate judgment document. Absent a separate judgment,
 Appellant's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate No. CAAP-11-0000414
 
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
