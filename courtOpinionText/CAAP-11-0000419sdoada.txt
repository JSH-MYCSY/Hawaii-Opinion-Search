APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0236)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Dana Williams ("Williams") appeals
 
from the April 19, 2011 Final Judgment entered in favor of
 
Defendants-Appellees Christine Kanemaru ("Kanemaru") and Denise
 Blas-Phillips ("Blas-Phillips") (collectively, "Defendants") in
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1
 
Williams sought recovery against the Defendants under theories of
 intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED") and
 libel/slander ("defamation").
 
On appeal, Williams argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
in granting the Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint filed
 on February 1, 2010 or, in the alternative, for summary judgment
 ("Motion to Dismiss/MSJ"), filed August 24, 2010, because "there
 remained triable issues of material fact with which a jury could

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
find in favor of Williams."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Williams's points of error as follows:
 
In ruling on the Motion to Dismiss/MSJ, the Circuit
 
Court considered supporting documents, separate from the
 pleadings; thus, the Motion to Dismiss/MSJ was disposed of as a
 motion for summary judgment. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 12(b). 
Therefore, it is Williams's task to show that the Circuit Court
 erred in entering summary judgment in Defendants' favor.
 
A. Defamation
 Williams's Complaint, as supported by her declaration
 
attached to her memorandum in opposition to the Motion to
 Dismiss/MSJ, states that Defendants defamed her by (1) accusing
 her of being a racist and (2) stating that Williams (a) bragged
 about being suspended, (b) retaliated against her accuser, and
 (c) brought down morale in the operating room.
2 According to
 
Williams, the defamation occurred during three in-office meetings
 that Williams had with the Defendants over a four-month period
 concerning an investigation conducted by the Defendants "related
 to concerns about the climate in the Operating Room and
 allegations that I contributed to creating the negative climate
 due to my derogatory comments and treatment of others." The
 first meeting was attended by Williams and the Defendants, while
 the second meeting included only Williams and Blas-Phillips. The
 third meeting included Williams, the Defendants, and another
 employee, Jody, who attended in response to Williams's request
 for a witness, although Jody was not the witness that Williams
 had requested.
 
To establish a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must
 
establish four elements:
 
(a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another;
 
(b) an unprivileged publication to a third party;
 
2
 In her opening brief, Williams also argued that Defendants falsely
accused her of "harassing co-employees," "being hostile," and "needing
professional help, i.e., being mentally ill." Williams, however, failed to
allege these purportedly defamatory statements in her Complaint.
 
2

(c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of
the publisher [actual malice where the plaintiff is a public
figure]; and
 
(d) either actionability of the statement irrespective of
special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the
publication.

(brackets in original) (quoting Dunlea v. Dappen, 83 Hawai' i 28, 
36, 924 P.2d 196, 204 (1996)). 
"Statements of opinions are not automatically immune 
from defamation actions[,]" Wilson v. Freitas, 121 Hawai' i 120, 
128, 214 P.3d 1110, 1118 (App. 2009) (citing Milkovich v. Lorain 
Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 17-22 (1990)), although, ultimately, "[the] threshold question in a defamation suit is whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statement implies an assertion of objective fact." Id. (quoting Uneiko Corp. v. 
Rooney, 912 F.2d 1049, 1053 (9th Cir. 1990)) (internal quotation mark omitted). "A defamatory communication may consist of a statement in the form of an opinion, but a statement of this nature is actionable only if it implies the allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis for the opinion." R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 566 (1977). "A simple expression of 
opinion based on disclosed . . . nondefamatory facts is not itself sufficient for an action of defamation, no matter how unjustified and unreasonable the opinion may be or how derogatory it is." Id. cmt. c. The rationale behind this rule is that when 
the facts are disclosed, third parties will understand that they are hearing the defendant's "interpretation of the facts presented; they are therefore unlikely to construe the statement as insinuating the existence of additional, undisclosed facts." See Standing Comm. on Discipline of the U.S. Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of Cal. v. Yagman, 55 F.3d 1430, 1439 (9th Cir. 1995). 
Here, as presented in Williams's declaration,
 
Defendants' alleged accusation that Williams was a "racist"
 occurred during an interview as part of an investigation into the
 climate of the operating room and complaints that Williams was
 mistreating others. Defendants allegedly accused her of being
 racist because she did not like Barack Obama and said that he
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
looks like a "bobble head" and because she made fun of a
 
colleague's manner of speech. Williams does not dispute that she
 said that Barack Obama looked like a bobble head, and she
 admitted that she made fun of her fellow colleague's manner of
 speech, adding only that her coworkers do so as well. 
Thus, Defendants' alleged statement that accused
 
Williams of being a racist, as presented, is merely an opinion
 characterizing Williams based on disclosed facts that Williams
 apparently recognizes as true. Because the basis for the opinion
 was disclosed, if the opinion were deemed unfounded or unfair,
 the listener would be free to reject it. See Yagman, 55 F.3d at
 
1439. Thus, the Circuit Court correctly granted summary judgment
 on Williams's defamation claim based on the Defendants allegedly
 stating that Williams was a racist.
 
The remaining allegedly defamatory statements fail
 
because they were privileged in the context of the intra­corporate investigation.
3 "A qualified privilege arises (1) when
 
the author of a defamatory statement reasonably acts in the
 discharge of some public or private duty, legal, moral, or social
 and (2) where the publication concerns a subject matter in which
 the author and the recipients of the publication have a
 correlative interest or duty." Kainz v. Lussier, 4 Haw. App.
 
400, 404, 667 P.2d 797, 801 (1983) (citing Aku v. Lewis, 52 Haw.
 366, 477 P.2d 162 (1970)).
 
"A qualified privilege can be lost if the defendant
 
abused the privilege by acting with malice." Farmer ex rel.
 
Keomalu v. Hickam Fed. Credit Union, No. 27868, 2010 WL 466007,
 at *9 (Haw. Ct. App. Feb. 2, 2010). "[W]here malice is alleged
 to extinguish a qualified privilege, defendant is required to act
 as a reasonable man under the circumstances, with due regard to
 the strength of his belief, the grounds that he has to support
 
3
 Satisfaction of the publication element requires that a plaintiff
establish that the false and defamatory statement was "communicated to some
third party other than the person defamed." Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. 
in Hawai' i, 100 Hawai' i 149, 171, 58 P.3d 1196, 1218 (2002) (quoting Runnels v. 
Okamoto, 56 Haw. 1, 3, 525 P.2d 1125, 1127 (1974)); see also R ESTATEMENT (SECOND)
OF TORTS § 577(1) (1977). Although some jurisdictions have held that a
communication can be published between agents of the same principal, see 
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 577 cmt. i, we need not decide here whether
publication occurred.

it, and the importance of conveying the information." Towse v.
 
State, 64 Haw. 624, 632–33, 647 P.2d 696, 703 (1982) (quoting
 
Russell v. American Guild of Variety Artists, 53 Haw. 456, 463,
 n.4, 497 P.2d 40, 45, n.4 (1972)) (internal quotation marks
 omitted).
 
Williams presented evidence that Blas-Phillips, with
 
4
Kanemaru and "Jody, the unit scheduler"  present, stated that
Williams bragged about being suspended, retaliated against her
 accuser, and brought down the morale in the operating room. 
Defendants argue that these statements merely framed the issues
 involved in their investigation and that they were protected from
 liability by virtue of a qualified privilege — that they "had a
 public and private duty to investigate claims for harassment and
 discrimination based on internal Pali Momi Medical Center
 policies, and state and federal law." In reply, Williams
 contends that the workplace investigation "was a mere pretext for
 punishing Williams for speaking out against the Defendants-
Appellees' presidential hopeful." 
Whether a qualified privilege exists is a question of 
law, but the issue of whether the privilege was abused is normally a question of fact for the jury. See Calleon v. Miyagi
, 
76 Hawai' i 310, 319, 876 P.2d 1278, 1287 (1994). But, as with 
other questions of fact examined in the context of a motion for summary judgment, a non-moving party "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Haw. R. Civ. P. 56(e). That is, as Williams does not contest the initial existence of the privilege itself, Williams was required to present facts tending to establish that Blas-Phillips acted with malice. 
Williams's declaration claims that she was singled out
 
for her behavior because of Kanemaru's "personal dislike" for her
 and the fact that she spoke out against Barack Obama. The
 contention, however, appears to be based on nothing more than
 speculation and conjecture. Mere speculation is insufficient to

that Jody's presence defeats the qualified privilege.

create a dispute of material fact. See Winfrey v. GGP Ala Moana,
 
No. SCWC-30589, 2013 WL 3776190, at *8 (Haw. July 18, 2013) (when
 
analyzing a motion for summary judgment, the court "is permitted
 to draw only those inferences of which the evidence is reasonably
 susceptible and it may not resort to speculation"); Hicks v.
 Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2010) ("[A] party may not rely
 on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the
 facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment." (brackets in
 original) (quoting Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., 68 F.3d 1451, 1456
 (2nd Cir. 1995))); Brothers v. Gen. Motors Corp., 658 P.2d 1108,
 1110 (Mont. 1983) ("Speculative statements are insufficient to
 raise a genuine issue of material fact."). Thus, Williams has
 not shown that the Circuit Court erred in granting Defendants
 summary judgment on her defamation claims.
 
B. Intentional infliction of emotional distress
 Williams contends that Defendants' alleged accusation 
that Williams was a racist constitute an IIED. The elements of IIED are "1) that the act allegedly causing the harm was intentional or reckless, 2) that the act was outrageous, and 3) that the act caused 4) extreme emotional distress to another." Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai' i 403, 429, 198 P.3d 666, 
692 (2008) (quoting Hac v. Univ. of Haw., 102 Hawai' i 92, 106-07, 
73 P.3d 46, 60-61 (2003)). 
"The question [of] whether the actions of the alleged 
tortfeasor are unreasonable or outrageous is for the court in the first instance, although where reasonable people may differ on that question it should be left to the jury." Id. (quoting 
Takaki v. Allied Mach. Corp., 87 Hawai' i 57, 68, 951 P.2d 507, 
518 (App. 1998). "Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." Tseu ex rel. Hobbs v. Jeyte, 88 Hawai' i 85, 93, 962 P.2d 344, 352 
(1998) (quoting R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 46 cmt. d (1965)). 
"[M]ere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities" are insufficient. Young, 119 
Hawai'i at 425, 198 P.3d at 688 (citation and internal quotation 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
marks omitted). See also Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc., 94 Hawai' i 
368, 387, 14 P.3d 1049, 1068 (2000) (holding that employer's 
shouting at and abusive manner toward employee, including public chastisement about attire and comportment, were not outrageous as a matter of law)). 
We cannot declare, on the record before us, that the 
Defendants' alleged accusation, representing an opinion based on disclosed facts, was "without just cause or excuse and beyond all the bounds of decency[,]" Fraser v. Morrison, 39 Haw. 370, 375 (Haw. Terr. 1952), abrogated on other grounds by, Hac v. Univ. of Haw., 105 Hawai' i 92, 92, 73, P.3d 46, 46 (2003); nor can we say 
that a reasonable person would be unable to adequately cope with the comments, characterizations, and reprimands arising from the Defendants' workplace investigation. Defendants' alleged accusation does not reach the high standard of outrageousness necessary to maintain an IIED claim; thus, this claim fails as a matter of law. 
C. Punitive damages
 Williams argues in her reply brief that the matter of
 
punitive damages should be left to the jury because her
 defamation and IIED claims should have survived summary judgment. 
Because we disagree with her underlying premise, we disagree that
 punitive damages remains a viable jury question.
 
Therefore, the April 19, 2011 Final Judgment is 
affirmed.
