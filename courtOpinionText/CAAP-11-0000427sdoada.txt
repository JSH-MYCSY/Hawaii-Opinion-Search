Defendant-Appellant Wendy Pierce ("Pierce") appeals

2
(2007) following the issuance of a citation by Officer Jonathan
Kaneshiro to Pierce on October 20, 2010 (for excessive speeding

On appeal, Pierce contends that the District Court
 
erred in admitting evidence of the laser-gun reading after the
 
State failed to establish that (1) the laser gun was tested
 according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures and that
 it was operating properly, and (2) Officer Kaneshiro's training
 to use of the laser gun met the manufacturer's requirements.

Consequently, Pierce contends that the District Court erred in
 convicting her based upon insufficient admissible evidence. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Pierce's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Sufficient foundation for admission of the laser-
gun reading requires evidence "that the laser gun's accuracy was tested according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer." State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 213–15, 216 P.3d 1227, 1236–38 
(2009). 
Here, the laser gun at issue was an LTI 20/20 True
 
Speed (The "True Speed" is spelled "TruSpeed," according to LTI's
 website, but both parties referred to it as the "True Speed"). 
Officer Kaneshiro testified that he had reviewed the
 manufacturer's recommended testing procedures in the user's
 manual, which bore the manufacturer's emblem. In August 2010, he
 attended a three-day training course on how to use and test the
 
3/
 Pierce also contends that the District Court erroneously admitted
the laser-gun reading because the State failed to establish that "the laser
gun had been inspected and serviced as required by the manufacturer."
Pierce, however, has not shown us where she objected to the admission of the
laser-gun reading on the basis that the gun had not been inspected and
serviced as required by the manufacturer. Consequently, we will not consider
the issue. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4).

True Speed taught by Bob Lung, a former police officer who held
 
himself out to be an independent contractor and consultant of the
 manufacturer, and was a certified trainer. Officer Kaneshiro
 stated that his training did not conflict with what he had read
 in the user's manual. Officer Kaneshiro testified that, on
 October 20, 2010, before, during, and after his shift, he tested
 the True Speed "according to the manufacturer's recommended
 standards" and determined that, "based on the training and the
 manufacturer testing procedures," the True Speed was operating
 properly. 
This testimony is sufficient to show that the laser 
gun's accuracy was tested according to procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 212–13, 216 P.3d at 
1235–36 (analyzing State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai' i 343, 167 P.3d 336 
(2007)). 
(2) Furthermore, to properly admit the laser-gun
 
reading into evidence the State must prove that "the nature and
 extent of an officer's training in the operation of a laser gun
 meets the requirements indicated by the manufacturer." Id. at
 
204, 213–15, 216 P.3d at 1236–38. 
Here, Officer Kaneshiro testified that he had read the
 
True Speed's user's manual, and claimed that the user's manual
 indicated what the manufacturer's procedures were with regard to
 training. Officer Kaneshiro attended a three-day training course
 taught by Bob Lung where he was instructed on "[t]he basic
 principals [sic] of laser operation, how the instrument works,
 how to correctly utilize the laser, . . . and then how to
 instruct others in the use of the laser." Furthermore, Officer

Kaneshiro testified that this training was consistent with the
 
user's manual. 
The trial court's determination of whether proper 
foundation has been established for the introduction of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 210, 
216 P.3d at 1233. Pierce has not shown an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., State v. Jenkins, No. 30295, 2011 WL 1620643, at *4 (Haw. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2011), cert. denied, SCWC-30295, 2011 WL 4448945 (Haw. Sept. 27, 2011); State v. Lalonde, No. 30482, 2011 WL 2520277, at *3 (Haw. Ct. App. June 22, 2011). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on April 27, 2011
 in the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, is
 affirmed.
