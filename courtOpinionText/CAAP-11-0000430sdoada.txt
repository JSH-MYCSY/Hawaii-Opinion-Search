(CIVIL NO. 1SD11-1-00002)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Todd Thurston Dickie (Dickie)
 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Denying HRPP Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 Judgment (Order Denying Rule 40 Petition), filed on April 27,
 2011 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division (district court).

On appeal, Dickie raises the following points of error:
 
(1) the district court erred in determining that it had jurisdiction in the underlying criminal case to convict Dickie of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), to which Dickie had pled no contest, because the charge lacked an essential element; and (2) the district court erred in construing the term "operate" in a manner that contradicts State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), essentially challenging

the district court's application of the Motta/Wells rule in 
construing the charge. See State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 
1019 (1983); State v. Wells, 78 Hawai' i 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Dickie's points of error as follows:
 
In the underlying criminal case, Case No. 1DTA-06­
13462, Dickie was convicted pursuant to his plea of no contest to
 OVUII in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­61(a)(1) and (3) (Supp. 2011).
 
Subsequently, in this case on March 9, 2011 (almost 
four years after his conviction), Dickie filed a Petition pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 and 
challenged, for the first time, the sufficiency of the OVUII charge. Dickie thus did not timely raise his objection to the OVUII charge before the trial court in Case No. 1DTA-06-13462. In Wheeler, the Hawai' i Supreme Court stated: 
this court has applied different principles depending on
whether or not an objection was timely raised in the trial
court. Under the "Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal
construction rule," we liberally construe charges challenged
for the first time on appeal. See Merino, 81 Hawai' i at 212,
915 P.2d at 686; Wells, 78 Hawai' i at 381, 894 P.2d at 78;
Elliott, 77 Hawai' i at 311, 884 P.2d at 374; State v. Motta,
66 Haw. 89, 90, 657 P.2d 1019, 1019-20 (1983). Under thisapproach, there is a "presumption of validity," Sprattling,
99 Hawai' i at 318, 55 P.3d at 282, for charges challenged
subsequent to a conviction. In those circumstances, thiscourt will "not reverse a conviction based upon a defectiveindictment [or complaint] unless the defendant can showprejudice or that the indictment [or complaint] cannot
within reason be construed to charge a crime." Merino, 81
Hawai'i at 212, 915 P.2d at 686 (citation omitted). 
121 Hawai' i at 399-400, 219 P.3d at 1186-87 (emphasis added). 
Where, as here, an objection to a charge is first raised after 
conviction in a collateral HRPP Rule 40 petition, the rationale for the Motta/Wells rule is equally applicable. Moreover, all information Dickie possessed up to the district court's ruling on Dickie's challenge to the charge, including as reflected in statements made by Dickie to the trial court in the criminal 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case, may be reviewed to determine if he was adequately informed 
of the charge against him. See State v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai' i 
369, 379, 235 P.3d 365, 375 (2010); see also Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 
at 396, 219 P.3d at 1183 (discussing inter alia State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 312, 318-21, 55 P.3d 276, 282-85 (2002)). 
In his Rule 40 Petition and in his arguments on appeal, 
Dickie does not attempt to show that he meets the requirements of the Motta/Wells rule. Rather, Dickie contends that because the OVUII charge failed to allege that he operated a vehicle "upon a public way, street, road, or highway" at the time of the offense, the charge was fatally defective under Wheeler and, thus, pursuant to cases such as State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 63 
P.3d 1109 (2003), the trial court in Case No. 1DTA-06-13462 did not have jurisdiction to convict him. The Hawai' i Supreme Court, 
however, has continued to uphold the validity of the Motta/Wells rule, both in Wheeler and post-Wheeler. See State v. Tominiko, 
126 Hawai' i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 1130 (2011); Hitchcock, 123 
Hawai'i at 379, 235 P.3d at 375. Therefore, we apply the 
Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal construction rule in construing the OVUII charge that Dickie now challenges by way of his collateral Rule 40 Petition. 
As noted, Dickie makes no attempt to carry his burden 
under the Motta/Wells rule and thus has waived any challenge on the issue of prejudice and whether the charge can within reason be construed to charge a crime. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) ("[p]oints not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded[.]"); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). Moreover, even if we reach those issues, the record indicates that Dickie cannot show he was prejudiced or that the charge cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime. First, Dickie's declaration in support of his Petition states that he was apprehended in the parking lot of Kahala Mall. The definition of "public way, street, road, or highway" includes "[a] parking lot, when any part thereof is open for use by the public or to which

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the public is invited for entertainment or business purposes[.]" 
HRS § 291E-1 (2007 Repl.). Therefore, Dickie does not and cannot
 assert that he was not operating his vehicle on a "public way,
 street, road, or highway."
 
Additionally, the district court made the following
 
findings of facts, which were made pursuant to the stipulation of
 the parties and which are thus unchallenged on appeal:
 
The following findings of fact numbered 1 through 5 were
stipulated by the parties:
 
1.	 Prior to November 17, 2009, Petitioner, who was
represented by counsel, was orally charged or
charged by way of written complaint and pled no
contest or guilty to one or more charges of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant (DUI) in violation of Section 291E­61, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS).
 
2.	 The oral or written charge did not include an
allegation that Petitioner committed the offense
on a public way, street, road, or highway.
 
3.	 Petitioner did not contest or otherwise
 challenge the charge as defective at the time of
arraignment and plea or any other time until the
filing of the instant petition filed pursuant to
Rule 40, HRPP.
 
4.	 After Petitioner was arraigned, he was asked if
he understood the charges against him and he
affirmatively responded "yes." In addition, he
completed the standard change of plea form
affirming that he had been advised of and
understood the nature and elements of the
 charges.
 
5.	 After pleading no contest, Petitioner's attorney
stipulated that there was a factual basis for
the charges against Petitioner.
 
By admitting that he understood the nature and elements of the
 
charges, Dickie cannot claim that he was not provided notice of
 all of the essential elements of OVUII. Dickie also stipulated
 to a factual basis for the OVUII charge. Therefore, given his
 own statements, both in the underlying criminal case and before
 the district court in this case, Dickie admitted that the charge
 could within reason be construed to charge the crime of OVUII.
