APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0160(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/
 
Appellants State of Hawai
'i and Department of Education's (the 
State Appellants) November 25, 2011 motion to determine
 
jurisdiction, or in the alternative, for a modification of the
 briefing schedule, (2) the lack of any response by any other
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
party in this appeal to the State Appellants' November 25, 2011 
motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over the State Appellants' appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000431 from the Honorable Joel E. August's February 23, 2011 judgment, because the February 23, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims
 or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to case upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
As the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained, "we should not 
make such searches necessary by allowing the parties the option 
of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n 
appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although multiple parties asserted multiple claims
 
against multiple parties, the February 23, 2011 judgment resolves
 only the cause of action for negligence in the amended complaint. 
The February 23, 2011 judgment neither resolves all parties'
 claims nor contains an express finding of no just reason for
 delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but less than all
 claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the February 23,
 2011 judgment does not satisfy requirements for an appealable
 judgment in a multiple-claim case under HRCP Rule 58 and the
 holding in Jenkins. Absent the entry of an appealable final
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
judgment, the appeal is premature, and we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over the Appeal NO. CAAP-11-0000431. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, in response to the State
 
Appellants' November 25, 2011 motion to determine jurisdiction,
 or in the alternative, for a modification of the briefing
 schedule, the appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000431 is dismissed
 for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
