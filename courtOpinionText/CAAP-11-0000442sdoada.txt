IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI» I 
ALBERT P. WILLIAMS, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI» I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 11-1-0002 (CR. NO. 93-2000))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard, and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Albert P. Williams, also known as
 
Allwyn P. Williams, (Williams), appeals, pro se, from the "Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" filed May 13, 2011
 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1 (circuit court). The
 
circuit court denied, without a hearing, Williams's "Petition to
 Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody" (Rule 40 Petition). The court found that
 
Williams's claims were "without merit, patently frivolous, and
 without a trace of support either in the record or from anything
 submitted by" him.
 
On appeal, Williams argues that his due process rights 
were violated when Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai» i (the 
State) (1) failed to inform him of his right to counsel and/or a 
1

preliminary hearing prior to his informal revocation proceedings; 
(2) failed to inform him of the "procedures for a preliminary
 hearing, the criteria to be weighed in deliberation, and the
 rights of the parolee during this process"; and (3) prevented him
 from presenting witnesses or cross-examining adverse witnesses.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Williams's points of error as follows:
 
The circuit court did not err in denying Williams's
 
Rule 40 Petition without a hearing.
 
In his Rule 40 Petition, Williams did not raise claims 
that his due process rights were violated when the State failed 
to inform him, prior to the parole revocation hearing, of his right to a preliminary hearing and to counsel. Therefore, those claims were waived. Hawai» i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 
40(a)(3) ("[A]n issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been raised . . . in a prior proceeding . . . ."); Hawai» i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) (the opening brief shall state "where in the record the alleged error was objected to . . . "). 
Even assuming arguendo that Williams preserved these 
claims in raising them in reply to the State, he waived them by pleading guilty at his parole revocation hearing and by not preserving them for appeal in a conditional plea. See Adams v. 
State
, 103 Hawai
» i 214, 225, 81 P.3d 394, 405 (2003) (brackets in 
original, emphasis, block quotation format, and citation 
omitted). ("[G]enerally, a guilty plea made voluntarily and intelligently precludes a defendant from later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims on appeal, including constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings.") Williams does not contend that his guilty plea was anything but voluntary and 
intelligent. 
Williams waived his remaining arguments, as well, when
 
he pled guilty at the revocation hearing.
 
Therefore,
