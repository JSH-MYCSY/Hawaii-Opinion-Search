Writ of Possession and For Disposal of Personal Property," both
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
entered April 29, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
The circuit court did not err in finding Real Party in
 
Interest JP Morgan Chase Bank National Association (Chase)
 
ratified the commencement of proceedings. Wise and Nihipali
 
contend Plaintiff-Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration
 
Systems, Inc. (MERS), did not have standing to commence
 
foreclosure proceedings. However, MERS submitted a declaration
 
from Chase confirming MERS's actions to date and authorizing MERS
 
to continue proceedings. The circuit court acknowledged Wise and
 
Nihipali's contention that MERS lacked standing, but found Chase
 
addressed those concerns by ratification of the proceedings.
 
Under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 17(a), an 
action must be commenced by a real party in interest. HRCP 
17(a). In the event an action commences under a party deemed not 
to be the real party at interest, the action shall not be 
dismissed if the action is timely ratified by the real party in 
interest. HRCP 17(a). Here, MERS submitted a declaration from 
Chase ratifying the commencement of proceedings in accordance 
with HRCP 17(a). The circuit court properly allowed the 
ratification where such ratification was formal and did not 
prejudice the defendants. See, Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 
142, 19 P.3d 699, 725 (2001). 
The circuit court did not err in finding Chase was the
 
holder of the "Fixed/Adjustable Rate Note (Note)." Wise and
 Nihipali challenge the Note MERS produced and contend Chase is
 
not the holder of the Note. MERS submitted a copy of the Note as
 
Exhibit A attached to their motion to confirm the sale. The Sr.

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lead Operations Specialist for Chase declared the Note to be a
 
true and accurate copy of the Note in Chase's possession,
 
satisfying Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 490:3-205(b) (2008
 
Repl.). HRS ยง 490:3-205(b) states the bearer of an instrument
 
endorsed in blank becomes the holder of that instrument. The
 
circuit court did not err in finding Chase to be the holder of
 
the Note where Chase bore the Note endorsed by Flexpoint Funding
 
Corporation to Washington Mutual Bank and the blank endorsement
 
by Washington Mutual Bank establishes Chase as the holder of the
 
Note.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment entered April
 
29, 2011 and the "Order Approving Report of Commissioner,
 Confirming Commissioner's Sale of Property at Public Sale,
 
Directing Distribution of Proceeds, For Writ of Possession and
 
For Disposal of Personal Property" also entered April 29, 2011 in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
