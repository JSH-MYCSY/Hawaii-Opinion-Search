NO. CAAP-11-0000450
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
AMERICAN SAVINGS BANK, F.S.B., Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DAVID BASQUE, II, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-274K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the parties' briefs and the record, it 
appears we lack jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant David 
Basque, II's (Basque) appeal from the May 5, 2011 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed July 26, 2010" (May 5, 2011 Order) entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
1. 
The May 5, 2011 Order is not an appealable order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a) (Supp. 2011), HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), and the collateral order doctrine. See, 
e.g., Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai' i 159, 165, 45 
P.3d 359, 365 (2002). 
On its face, the May 5, 2011 Order appeared to be an 
appealable order under either HRS § 667-51(a) or HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine. The May 5, 2011 Order constituted a "judgment" under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure

(HRCP) Rule 54(a)2. Basque filed his notice of appeal from the
 
May 5, 2011 Order on June 6, 2011, and "[g]enerally, the filing
 
of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction
 over the appealed case." TSA Int'l, Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92
 
Hawai'i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted). 
However, in this case, Basque timely invoked Hawai' i Rules of 
3
 Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3) and thereby extended
both the duration of the circuit court's jurisdiction and the
 thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) through the HRCP
 
4
 Rule 59 motion he timely filed on February 3, 2011 to set aside
the circuit court's impending entry of the May 5, 2011 Order. 
The fact that Basque filed his February 3, 2011 HRCP Rule 59
 motion prematurely (i.e., prior to entry of the May 5, 2011
 Order) did not negate its effect under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) or HRCP
 Rule 59. See, e.g., Saranillio v. Silva, 78 Hawai' i 1, 7, 889 
P.2d 685, 691 (1995) ("HRCP [Rule] 59 does not require that a
 motion be served after the entry of judgment; it imposes only an
 
2 HRCP Rule 54(a) provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 54. JUDGMENTS; COSTS; ATTORNEYS' FEES.
 
(a) Definition; form. "Judgment" as used in these rules
include a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.
 
3 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
 Rule 4. APPEALS - WHEN TAKEN.
 
(a) Appeals in civil cases.
. . . .
 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (emphases added).

 Basque's February 3, 2011 "Motion to set Aside Summary Judgment"
was a motion to alter or amend a judgment under HRCP Rule 59(e), although not
denominated as such. "[T]he substance of the pleading controls, not the
nomenclature given to the pleading." Madden v. Madden, 43 Haw. 148, 2, 1959
 
WL 11630 (Haw. Terr. 1959).

outer [ten-day] time limit on the service of a motion to alter or
 
amend the judgment[.]"). Therefore, despite the filing of
 Basque's June 6, 2011 notice of appeal, the trial court retained
 
5
 jurisdiction up to ninety days under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for the
limited purpose of adjudicating Basque's February 3, 2011 HRCP
 Rule 59 motion to set aside the circuit court's impending entry
 of the May 5, 2011 Order. When the circuit court entered the
 July 1, 2011 order granting Basque's February 3, 2011 HRCP Rule
 59 motion, the circuit court effectively set aside the May 5,
 2011 Order. Therefore, the May 5, 2011 Order was not an
 appealable order.
 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a 
judgment in favor or against the party 
by the time the record is 
filed in the [Intermediate Court of Appeals] will be dismissed." Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 120, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1339 (1994) (emphasis added). Furthermore, "[i]t is the responsibility of each appellant to provide a record, as defined in [HRAP] Rule 10 and the Hawai' i Court Records Rules, 
that is sufficient to review the points asserted and to pursue appropriate proceedings in the court or agency from which the appeal is taken to correct any omission." HRAP Rule 11(a). On August 4, 2011, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000450, at which time the record on appeal did not contain an appealable order or appealable judgment. Absent an appealable order or appealable judgment, we lack jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000450. 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack

 Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), "[t]he rule provides that the court
has 90 days to dispose of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . ,regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." Buscher v. Boning, 114 
Hawai'i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007). When "the court fail[s] to issue
an order on [the movant's post-judgment tolling] motion by . . . ninety daysafter [the movant has] filed the [post-judgment tolling] motion, the [post­judgment tolling] motion [is] deemed denied." Cnty. of Hawai' i v. C&J Coupe
Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai' i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008). The 
supreme court holds that when such a motion "is prematurely filed prior to theentry of final judgment, we will deem such motion filed immediately after thejudgment becomes final for the purpose of calculating the 90-day period."Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai' i at 221, 159 P.3d at 833.

jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.
