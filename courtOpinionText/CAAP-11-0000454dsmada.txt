NO. CAAP-11-0000454
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
P. DENISE LaCOSTA,
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee,
v. 
MICHAEL MOORE and HAWAIIAN BUNGALOWS, LLC,
Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellants,
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-20, JANE DOES 1-20, et al.,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(DC-CIVIL NO. 09-1-2199)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendants/Counterclaim-
Plaintiffs/Appellants Michael Moore (Appellant Moore) and
 Hawaiian Bungalows, LLC (Appellant Hawaiian Bungalows), have
 asserted from the Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano's May 10, 2011
 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order" (the May 10,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2011 FOF/COL/ Order), because the May 10, 2011 FOF/COL/Order is
 
not an appealable final order under Hawai' i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), 
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts. In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies. A final order means an
 
order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order, or decree
ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
 
omitted; emphases added). In district court cases, Rule 58 of
 the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP),
 
in contrast to HRCP Rule 58, does not by its plain language
require that judgment be set forth on a "separate document."Thus, the requirements set forth in Jenkins [v. CadesSchutte Fleming & Wright, 76, Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334
(1994)], are not applicable to district court cases.Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an action inthe district court may be final and appealable without theentry of judgment on a separate document, as long as theappealed order ends the litigation by fully deciding therights and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothingfurther to be adjudicated. 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphasis added).
 
The May 10, 2011 FOF/COL/Order resolves all of the
 
claims in Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee P. Denise
 
La Costa's amended complaint, but the May 10, 2011 FOF/COL/Order
 does not resolve Appellant Moore and Appellant Hawaiian
 Bungalows' counterclaims. Consequently, the May 10, 2011
 FOF/COL/Order does not end the litigation. The district court
 has yet to enter an order that fully decides the rights and

liabilities of all parties by resolving Appellant Moore and
 
Appellant Hawaiian Bungalows' counterclaims, which are still
 pending before the district court. Absent an appealable final
 order, we lack jurisdiction over appellate court case number
 CAAP-11-0000454, and this appeal is premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000454 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
