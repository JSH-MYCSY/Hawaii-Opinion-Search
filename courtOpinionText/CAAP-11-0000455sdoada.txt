IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JESSE CERA, Defendant-Appellant, and
REMELITO PABLO, also known as
REYNOLD PABLO, Defendant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0456)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jesse Cera ("Cera") appeals from
 
the May 9, 2011 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence of the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").1 Cera was
 
convicted and found guilty of (1) methamphetamine trafficking in
 the second degree, Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") 712-1240.8
 (Supp. 2011); (2) promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree,
 HRS ยง 712-1243 (Supp. 2011); and (3) unlawful use of drug
 paraphernalia, HRS ยง 329-43.5(a) (2010). 
On appeal, Cera raises one point of error: that the
 
Circuit Court erred when it refused to instruct the jury to
 consider specific factors when weighing the trustworthiness of
 eyewitness identification of Cera as the perpetrator. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, and taking notice of the Hawai' i Supreme Court's decision in State v. 
Cabagbag, __ P.3d __, No. SCWC-30682, 2012 WL 1764064 (Haw. 
1 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
May 17, 2012), we resolve Cera's point of error as follows:
 
State v. Cabagbag is directly on point. Cabagbag 
stated a new rule: "in criminal cases, the circuit courts must 
give the jury a specific eyewitness identification instruction whenever identification evidence is a central issue in the case, and it is requested by the defendant[.]" 2012 WL 1764064, at *1. Noting, however, that this holding "mark[ed] a departure from the prior approach" in Hawai' i, the Supreme Court held that "as to 
the instant case and other cases that are currently pending on direct appeal, this court will apply the rule then in effect when the cases were tried." Id. at *12, 14 (emphasis added). 
Here, Cera's case was pending on direct appeal as of
 
May 17, 2012, the date the Supreme Court issued its opinion in
 Cabagbag. Thus, we apply the law as it existed when the case was
 tried.
 
Under the law prior to Cabagbag, "the decision to give
 
a special instruction on eyewitness identification rested within
 the sound discretion of the trial court." Id. at *12. When
 
determining whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion, "we
 must examine all aspects of the trial, including the opening
 statements, the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, the
 arguments to the jury, and the general instruction given by the
 court, to determine whether the jury's attention was adequately
 drawn to the identification evidence." Id. at *14 (quoting State
 
v. Okumura, 78 Hawai' i 383, 405, 894 P.2d 80, 102 (1995), 
abrogated prospectively by Cabagbag). 
Here, the trial record is replete with questioning of
 
witnesses and statements made during the opening and closing
 arguments challenging or calling into question the
 trustworthiness of the eyewitness-identification evidence. 
Furthermore, the Circuit Court's general jury instructions
 correctly and thoroughly instructed the jurors on applicable
 burdens of proof and their right to credit or discredit witness
 testimony. Thus, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 in refusing to specifically instruct the jury on factors to
 consider when examining the trustworthiness of an eyewitness
 identification because "the jury's attention was adequately drawn

to the identification evidence." Id. at *14 (quoting Okumura, 78 
Hawai'i at 405, 894 P.2d at 102). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit
 
Court's May 9, 2011 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence is
 
affirmed.
