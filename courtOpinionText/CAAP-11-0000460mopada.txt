IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
In the Matter of Attorney's Fees Pertaining to
JOHN C. MCLAREN, Appellant,
in the case of
 
ETSUKO FURUKAWA, Claimant,
 
v.
 
PARADISE INN HAWAII LLC, Employer,
and
 
FIRST SECURITY INSURANCE COMPANY OF
 
HAWAII, INC., Insurance Carrier
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2010-341 (2-07-45923))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Appellant John C. McLaren (McLaren) appeals from (1) a
 
March 21, 2011 decision and order by the Labor and Industrial
 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB)and (2) a May 11, 2011 order
 denying McLaren's motion for reconsideration. The LIRAB
 concluded McLaren's appeal was untimely, and it affirmed a
 decision by the director of the Department of Labor and
 Industrial Relations Disability Compensation Division (director)
 regarding McLaren's request for attorney's fees and costs. On
 appeal, McLaren raises several points essentially contending the
 LIRAB erred in concluding his appeal was untimely and in refusing
 to review the merits of the director's decision.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
McLaren represented a claimant in a workers'
 
compensation case before the Department of Labor and Industrial
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Relations (DLIR) Disability Compensation Division. The case
 
resulted in a stipulation and settlement agreement order
 declaring the workers' compensation award that the claimant would
 receive.
 
On March 1, 2010, McLaren filed with the DLIR a request
 
for attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $7,105.52,
 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-94 (Supp. 2012).
 
On June 8, 2010, the director approved McLaren's request in the
 
reduced amount of $3,729.63. The decision informed McLaren he
 could appeal by filing a written notice of appeal with the
 director within twenty days after the mailing of a copy of the
 decision.
 
On September 7, 2010, McLaren appealed to the LIRAB
 
from the director's June 8, 2010 decision. Before filing this
 appeal to the LIRAB, McLaren had also filed the following
 documents with the DLIR: a June 14, 2010 letter with the heading
 "Objection To Approval Of Attorney's Fees Dated June 8, 2010 And
 Request For Disability Compensation Division Hearing"; a June 28,
 
2010 Form WC-77 Application for Hearing; a July 19, 2010 Request
 
to Access Government Records regarding the director's June 8,
 2010 decision; and an August 4, 2010 letter repeating his request
 for a hearing and for access to records.
 
The LIRAB held a hearing on McLaren's appeal on
 
December 16, 2010. On March 21, 2011, the LIRAB issued a
 decision and order concluding that McLaren's appeal to the LIRAB
 was untimely and that none of McLaren's earlier filings with the
 DLIR constituted timely appeals. Consequently, the LIRAB
 affirmed the director's June 8, 2010 decision. McLaren filed a
 timely motion for reconsideration to the LIRAB on April 20, 2011,
 contending the LIRAB "erroneously overlooked pertinent facts,
 legal authority, and argument[.]" The LIRAB denied McLaren's
 motion on May 11, 2011, and McLaren filed a timely notice of
 appeal to this court on June 9, 2011.
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS
§ 91-14(g) [(2012 Repl.)], which states that: 
2
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the decision
of the agency or remand the case with instructions for
further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;
or
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of
the agency; or
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 (4) Affected by other error of law; or
 (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion.
 
Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai' i 402, 405-06, 38 P.3d 570, 
573-74 (2001).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
HRS § 386-87 (1993) provides:
 
§386-87 Appeals to appellate board.  (a)   A decision
 
of the director shall be final and conclusive between the
 parties, except as provided in section 386-89 [(Supp.
2012)], unless within twenty days after a copy has been sent
to each party, either party appeals therefrom to the
appellate board by filing a written notice of appeal with
the appellate board or the department. In all cases of
 appeal filed with the department the appellate board shall
be notified of the pendency thereof by the director. 
HRS § 386-87(a). An order regarding the award or denial of
 
attorney's fees and costs pursuant to HRS § 386-94 is a final
 order for the purposes of appeal in workers' compensation cases. 
See Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co.,  104 Hawai' i 164, 169, 
86 P.3d 973, 978 (2004). 
McLaren does not dispute that he filed his appeal from
 
the director's June 8, 2010 decision to the LIRAB on September 7,
 2010. The time for filing a notice of appeal to the LIRAB is
 mandatory. 
See Kissell v. Labor & Indus. Relations Appeal Bd.,
 
57 Haw. 37, 549 P.2d 470 (1976) (addressing time to appeal under
 predecessor statute to HRS § 386-87). The LIRAB correctly
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concluded McLaren's appeal was untimely, and therefore his appeal
 
of the director's decision was barred by HRS § 386-87(a).
 
McLaren's argument that his filings to the DLIR
 
constituted applications to reopen the case pursuant to HRS
 § 386-89 (1993)
1
 is without merit.  The reopening of a case under 
HRS § 386-89 tolls the twenty-day time limitation for appealing the director's decision. Alvarez v. Liberty House, Inc., 85 
Hawai'i 275, 278, 942 P.2d 539, 542 (1997); HRS § 386-87(a). 
However, HRS § 386-89 states in relevant part that the director may reopen a case "to permit the introduction of newly discovered evidence" or "on the ground that fraud has been practiced on the director or on any party[.]" HRS § 386-89(a), (b). None of McLaren's filings asserted newly discovered evidence or fraud. Therefore, the time for appealing the director's June 8, 2010 decision was not tolled. 
With regard to McLaren's argument that a request for
 
attorney's fees must be resolved by the Disability Compensation
 Division via a contested case hearing and the procedures that
 attach thereto, we disagree. 
As defined in HRS § 91-1 (2012
 
Repl.), a "'[c]ontested case' means a proceeding in which the
 legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are
 required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency
 
1
 HRS § 386-89 (1993) states, in pertinent part:
 
§386-89 Reopening of cases; continuing jurisdiction
of director.  (a) In the absence of an appeal and within
twenty days after a copy of the decision has been sent to
each party, the director of labor and industrial relations
may upon the director's own motion or upon the application
of any party reopen a case to permit the introduction of
newly discovered evidence, and may render a revised
decision.
 
(b) The director may at any time, either of the
director's own motion or upon the application of any party,
reopen any case on the ground that fraud has been practiced
on the director or on any party and render such decision as
is proper under the circumstances.
 
(c) On the application of any party in interest,
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination of
fact related to the physical condition of the injured
employee, the director may . . . review a compensation case
and issue a decision[.]

hearing." (Emphasis added). McLaren points to no statute, rule
 
or legal authority that requires his request for attorney's fees
 to be determined after an opportunity for an agency hearing. We
 also disagree to the extent that he suggests his due process
 rights have been infringed. McLaren had the opportunity pursuant
 to HRS § 386-87 to appeal the reduction of his attorney's fees
 request to the LIRAB, but he did not timely seek an appeal."
 
McLaren's remaining arguments are also without merit.
