MICHAEL L. CARTER, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 09-1-0027 (CR. NO. 04-1-1977))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley, and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Michael L . Carter (Carter)
 
appeals pro se from the "Order Denying Petitioner Michael L.
 
Carter's Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing"
 (Order Denying Rule 40 Petition), filed April 14, 2011 in the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  The circuit
 
court denied without a hearing, Carter's July 28, 2009 Petition
 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody (alternatively, "7/28/09 Rule 40
 Petition" and "7/28/09 Petition") and included the claims Carter
 added in his "Motion to Amend Rule 40 Petition Pursuant to
 
H.R.P.P.
 40(e)" (Petition Supplement) filed April 19, 2010.

 The Honorable Edward H. Kubo, Jr. presided.

The court concluded, inter alia, that Carter could and
 
should have raised his arguments in his first Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 Custody, filed September 12, 2008 (9/12/08 Rule 40 Petition) or
 in his subsequent appeal. Consequently, his claims were waived. 
On appeal, Carter argues that the circuit court erred
 
in denying his 7/28/09 Rule 40 Petition and Petition Supplement
 without a hearing because (1) his sentence was illegal, (2) his
 Rule 11 plea agreement was violated, (3) the Hawaii Paroling
 Authority did not correct his sentence, and (4) he moved to amend
 his 9/12/08 Rule 40 Petition to include these claims, but the
 court "refused to answer any of [his] motions."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Carter's points of error as follows: 
The circuit court did not err in denying Carter's Rule 
40 Petition without a hearing. Carter waived his arguments in his 7/28/09 Rule 40 Petition and Petition Supplement by failing to raise them in his 9/12/08 Rule 40 Petition or subsequent appeal. We note that he also failed to raise his fourth point of error in his 7/28/09 Petition and Petition Supplement. He does not prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances that would justify his failure to do so. Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 40(a)(3); Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(4).
