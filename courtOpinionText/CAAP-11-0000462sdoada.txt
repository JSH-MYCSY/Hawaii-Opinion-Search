APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2620)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant and Cross-Appellee Melvin McAulton
 
(McAulton) appeals pro se from an April 18, 2011 Judgment
 
(Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (Circuit Court) in favor of Defendant-Appellee and CrossÂ­
1
Appellant Cambridge Management, Inc. (Cambridge).  Cambridge
 
cross-appeals from the same judgment.
 
In various sections of the Opening Brief, McAulton 
prefaces numerous statements, issues, and/or arguments with the 
phrase "Point of Error". 
However, these points, and other parts 
of McAulton's brief, in many significant ways do not comply with 
the requirements of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
28(b) and are otherwise indiscernible. It appears that McAulton

seeks a determination by this appellate court concerning the
 
merits of his tort claim against Cambridge. The Circuit Court,
 
however, did not enter its judgment against McAulton and in favor
 
of Cambridge based on the merits of the parties' claims and
 
defenses. Rather, the Circuit Court granted Cambridge's motion
 
to dismiss McAulton's Complaint with prejudice for want of
 
prosecution and for attorneys' fees and costs. On appeal,
 
McAulton failed to raise any discernible point of error
 
concerning the dismissal of the Complaint and/or the award of
 
attorneys' fees and costs. Upon careful review of the record and
 
the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due
 
consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by
 
the parties, we conclude that the Circuit Court's judgment in
 
favor of Cambridge and against McAulton must be affirmed.
 
Accordingly, we need not reach the issue raised by
 
Cambridge on its cross-appeal.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's April 18, 2011
 
Judgment is affirmed.
