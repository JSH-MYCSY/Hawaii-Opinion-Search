MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant, Jack Thomas (Thomas) appeals from
 
the Final Judgment entered May 13, 2011 in the Circuit Court of
 
1
the Third Circuit  (circuit court).  Judgment was entered 
pursuant to the (1) "Order Granting Defendants County of Hawai' i, 
Jay Kimura and Jefferson R. Malate's Motion to Dismiss 
Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint Filed January 12, 2012 as to 
Cause of Action for Violation of Privacy Rights Under the

the (3) "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider 
Defendants County of Hawai' i, Jay Kimura and Jefferson R. 
Malate's Motion for Summary Judgment (HRCP, Rule 60) Filed September 9, 2010, Filed April 4, 2011" entered June 13, 2011. 
Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants-Appellees County of 
Hawai'i (County), Jay Kimura (Kimura), and Jefferson R. Malate 
(Malate) (collectively, Defendants) and against Thomas as to all asserted claims. 
On appeal, Thomas contends the circuit court erred when
 
it:
 
(1) granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants
 
despite Thomas's submission of admissible evidence establishing
 
the essential elements for a claim of malicious prosecution;
 
(2) granted summary judgment in favor of Kimura though
 
Kimura failed to submit any evidence in support of the September
 
9, 2010 "[Defendants'] Motion for Summary Judgment" (MSJ); and 
(3) dismissed Thomas's claim for violation of privacy 
rights under the Constitution of the State of Hawai' i and Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 92F (1993 & Supp. 2011) for lack of standing to assert a private claim. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 26, 2005, Defendants filed a criminal
 
complaint alleging violation of a temporary restraining order
 
(TRO) that had been issued against Thomas based on a March 26,
 
2004 incident between Thomas and his neighbor. At a May 11, 2004
 
hearing, the matter had been resolved in Thomas's favor when the
 
2
district court,  after consideration of allegations brought by
Thomas's neighbor, including the March 26, 2004 incident,
 
dissolved the TRO due to insufficient evidence. 
On April 12,
 
2007, Thomas filed the complaint in this case against Defendants
 alleging malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and violations
 
of federal and state statutes and the United States

Constitutions ; and on January 12, 2010, filed his second amended
complaint, alleging violation of his privacy rights. On March 
11, 2010, Defendants filed "[Defendants'] Motion to Dismiss 
Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint Filed January 12, 2010 as to 
Cause of Action for Violation of Privacy Rights Under the 
Constitution of the State of Hawai' i and [Chapter] 92F of the 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes" (Motion to Dismiss). On September 9, 
2010, Defendants filed their MSJ. 
On March 8, 2011, the circuit court granted both the
 
Motion to Dismiss and MSJ. On April 4, 2011, Thomas filed a
 
Motion for Reconsideration. The circuit court entered Final
 
Judgment May 13, 2011. On June 13, 2011, the circuit court
 
denied Thomas's Motion for Reconsideration. On June 9, 2011,
 
Thomas timely filed an appeal.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Dismissal of complaint
 
The appellate court reviews a dismissal under Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6) de novo. Bacerra 
v. MacMillan, 111 Hawai' i 117, 119, 138 P.3d 749, 751 (2006). 
B. Summary judgment
 
[An appellate] court reviews a trial court's grant of
 
summary judgment de novo. O'ahu Transit Servs., Inc. v. 
Northfield Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 231, 234, 112 P.3d 717, 720 
(2005). The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment
 is well settled:
 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of

 Thomas also filed a complaint against Defendants in the United
States District Court for the District of Hawaii (District Court), which, on
October 2, 2008, adjudicated Thomas's United States Constitution and 42
U.S.C. § 1983 claims. The District Court granted Defendants' Motion for
Summary Judgment and Remanding State Law Claims on the grounds that (1) the
Plaintiff failed to timely raise claims not included in the complaint, and (2)
absolute immunity protected Defendants from § 1983 claims.

a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, [the appellate court]
must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn
 therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing
the motion.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. The circuit court did not err in dismissing
Thomas's claim for violation of privacy under HRS
Chapter 92F, the Uniform Information Practices Act
4
(UIPA).
Thomas contends Defendants violated HRS § 92F-14(9)
 
when the criminal complaint signed by Malate allegedly disclosed
 
Thomas's social security number. Defendants argue that HRS
 
Chapter 92F does not provide a private right of action. The
 
circuit court agreed with Defendants and dismissed the claim,
 
stating HRS Chapter 92F "does not permit a private cause of
 
action for an allegation of a violation of a right to privacy."
 
Thomas failed to file his complaint and second amended 
complaint as to his claim of violations of his privacy rights 
under the Constitution of the State of Hawai' i and HRS Chapter 
92F within the applicable statute of limitations, HRS § 657-7. HRS § 657-7 provides that "[a]ctions for the recovery of 
compensation for damages or injury to persons," as the case here, 
"shall be instituted within two years after the cause of action 
accrue[s] . . . ." 
Thomas's alleged cause of action of violation of his 
privacy rights accrued on or about January 26, 2005, when the 
criminal complaint was filed against him. Waugh v. University of 
Hawai'i, 63 Haw. 117, 127, 621 P.2d 957, 966 (1980). Thomas did 
not file his complaint until April 12, 2007, and his second 
4
 HRS §92F-1 Short title. This chapter shall be known and may be
cited as the Uniform Information Practices Act (Modified). 
4
             NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amended complaint, alleging violation of his privacy rights,
 
until January 12, 2010. In answer to Thomas's violation of
 
privacy claim, Defendants raised the defense that Thomas failed
 
to file his complaint and second amended complaint within the
 
applicable statute of limitations. Defendants raised the same
 
point in their motion to dismiss Thomas's claim of violation of
 
privacy rights, citing HRS § 657-7.
 
Our review of the dismissal of Thomas's privacy claims
 
is de novo. Because Thomas failed to file his privacy claims
 
within the applicable statute of limitations, HRS § 657-7, we
 
affirm the order dismissing these privacy claims.
 
B. The circuit court correctly granted Defendants'
Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
Thomas alleges Defendants maliciously prosecuted a
 
criminal complaint against Thomas despite evidence the incident
 
in the criminal complaint was previously adjudicated in Thomas's
 
favor. Defendants contend Malate and Kimura were not aware the
 
prior proceedings took place at the time the charges were filed.
 
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants
 
on the grounds that "uncontroverted evidence" showed probable
 
cause to file the criminal complaint.
 
A claim for malicious prosecution must show three 
essential elements, "that the prior proceedings were (1) 
terminated in the plaintiff's favor[;] (2) initiated without 
probable cause[;] and (3) initiated with malice." Young v. 
Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai' i 403, 417, 198 P.3d 666, 680 
(2008). Neither Thomas nor Defendants dispute evidence that the 
prior criminal proceeding initiated by Defendants terminated in 
Thomas's favor, satisfying the first element of malicious 
prosecution.
 As to the second and third elements of the malicious
 
prosecution claim, Defendants bore the burden of demonstrating
 
that the prior proceedings were initiated with probable cause or
 
without malice. In support of the MSJ, Defendants asserted there
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was probable cause for initiating proceedings against Thomas. 
Probable cause exists where the party initiating the action 
"correctly or reasonably" believes there are facts sufficient to 
base a claim. Brodie v. Hawai' i Automotive Retail Gasoline 
Dealers Ass'n Inc., 2 Haw. App. 316, 318, 631 P.2d 600, 603 
(1981) rev’d on other grounds, 65 Haw. 598, 655 P.2d 863 (1982). 
In Malate's Supplemental Declaration filed January 10, 2011, he 
declares the March 26, 2004 police report alleging Thomas 
violated a valid protective order gave him probable cause to file 
criminal charges against Thomas. 
Once Defendants presented evidence of probable cause, 
the burden shifted to Thomas to show "specific facts" that 
Defendants acted without probable cause and with malice. Wong v. 
Cayetano, 111 Hawai' i 462, 483, 143 P.3d 1, 22 (2006). Thomas 
argues Defendants had no probable cause to file criminal charges 
since Defendants were aware of prior civil proceedings 
adjudicating the March 26, 2004 incident. Thomas, however, 
failed to show in his "Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to 
[Defendants' MSJ]" filed November 22, 2010, specifically when 
Defendants became aware of the civil proceedings. Thomas stated 
in his "Original Supplemental Declaration of [Thomas] Regarding 
Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to [Defendants' MSJ]" filed 
December 1, 2010, that he "personally supplied the prosecutor's 
office" with transcripts and letters demonstrating that a civil 
court adjudicated the March 26, 2004 incident in Thomas's favor, 
but failed to state the date he delivered these documents to 
Defendants. Thomas provided a letter that was sent to Defendants 
on March 9, 2005 informing Defendants of the prior civil 
proceedings. However, probable cause must be determined based on 
the facts known at the time the charge is filed rather than on 
any knowledge gained after the charge is filed. Orso v. City & 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 56 Haw. 241, 250, 534 P.2d 489, 495 (1975) 
overruled on other grounds by Kahale v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 
104 Hawai' i 341, 90 P.3d 233 (2004). The letter provided to 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Defendants after January 26, 2005, the date criminal charges were
 
filed by Defendants against Thomas, was not helpful to Thomas. 
Thomas failed to provide specific facts demonstrating
 
Defendants had initiated criminal proceedings against him without
 
probable cause or with maliciousness. Therefore, the circuit
 
court correctly granted Defendants' MSJ in Thomas's malicious
 
prosecution claim. 
Thomas additionally contends the circuit court erred in
 
granting the MSJ as to Kimura due to his failure to contest the
 
allegations specifically made against him. However, in their
 
MSJ, Defendants included a Memorandum in Support of the Motion
 
addressing Thomas's claims and attached an exhibit of Kimura's
 
deposition testimony contesting Thomas's claims against him.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Final Judgment entered May 13, 2011 in the Circuit
 
Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
