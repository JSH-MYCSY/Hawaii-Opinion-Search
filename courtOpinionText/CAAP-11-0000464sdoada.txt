SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kaeokulani Kawananakoa
 
(Kawananakoa) appeals from the "Notice of Entry Judgment and/or
 
Order and Plea/Judgment" (Judgment) filed on May 12, 2011, in the
 District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).

Kawananakoa was charged by complaint with (1) Operating a Vehicle
 Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3)

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provide as follows:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence
of an intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual
physical control of a vehicle:

(2007). 
Prior to trial, Kawananakoa filed a written "Motion to
 
Dismiss [Re: Failure to Allege an Essential Fact]," in which he
 
argued that the OVUII charge was deficient for failing to allege
 that he committed the OVUII offense intentionally, knowingly, or
 recklessly. He also orally moved to dismiss the complaint as
 deficient because it contained the facsimile signature, and not
 the actual handwritten signature, of the deputy prosecuting
 attorney. The District Court denied Kawananakoa's written and
 oral motions to dismiss. 
Kawananakoa pleaded no contest to the reckless driving

charge,  and he proceed to trial on the OVUII charge.  After a
 
bench trial, the District Court found Kawananakoa guilty of
 OUVII, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and HRS § 291E­61(a)(3). 
I.
 
On appeal, Kawananakoa argues that the District Court 
erred in: (1) denying his oral motion to dismiss the complaint, which was based on his contention that the complaint was not properly signed; (2) denying his written motion to dismiss the OVUII charge as deficient for failure to allege that he committed the offense intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; and (3) failing to conduct the colloquy required by 
Tachibana v. State, 
79 Hawai' i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995). As explained below, we

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conclude that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was deficient for
 
failing to allege mens rea, but that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3)
 charge was sufficient; we vacate Kawananakoa OVUII conviction
 based on the District Court's failure to comply with Tachibana;
 and we remand the case for further proceedings.
 
II.
 
We resolve the arguments raised by Kawananakoa on
 
appeal as follows:
 
1. We conclude that the District Court did not err in 
denying Kawananakoa's oral motion to dismiss the complaint. When the complaint in this case was filed, the Hawai' i Supreme Court's 
April 26, 2010, "Order Extending Pilot Project for Submitting Written Criminal Complaints by Electronic Mail in the District Courts of the First, Third, and Fifth Circuits of the State of Hawai'i" (Pilot Project Order) was in effect. The Pilot Project 
Order permits complaints to be signed by means of a facsimile signature of duly authorized prosecutors. 
Kawananakoa had the burden of establishing that the 
complaint was deficient for failing to comply with the Pilot Project Order. See State v. Almeida, 54 Haw. 443, 448, 509 P.2d 
549, 552 (1973) (concluding that a defendant who files a motion to dismiss bears the burden of presenting a prima facie case showing that he or she is entitled to dismissal); State v. Layton, 53 Haw. 513, 516, 497 P.2d 559, 561–62 (1972) (noting that an indictment has a presumption of validity); State v. Rodrigues, 63 Haw. 412, 417, 629 P.2d 1111, 1115 (1981) ("In challenging the validity of an indictment, the defendant has the burden to establish prejudice."); State v. Chong, 86 Hawai' i 290, 
295, 949 P.2d 130, 135 (App. 1997) (stating that "the defendant bears the burden of proof when challenging an indictment"). 
Here, the complaint against Kawananakoa contained a
 
facsimile signature of a deputy prosecutor and was valid on its
 face. In support of his oral motion to dismiss, Kawananakoa did
 not provide any basis for believing that the facsimile signature
 appearing on the complaint, or any other aspect of the complaint,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
failed to comply with the Pilot Project Order. We conclude that
 
Kawananakoa failed to meet his burden of setting forth a prima
 facie case that he is entitled to the dismissal of the complaint
 based on a claim that it was not properly signed or that it
 failed to comply with the Pilot Project Order. Accordingly, the
 District Court properly denied Kawananakoa's oral motion to
 dismiss. 
2. We conclude that the portion of the OVUII charge 
that asserted an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) violation was sufficient. The OVUII charge against Kawananakoa did not allege a mens rea with respect to either the violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) or HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). In State v. Nesmith, Nos. SCWC-10-0000072, SCWC-30438, 2012 WL 1648974 (Hawai' i April 12, 2012), the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court recently held that (1) mens rea must be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not be alleged (or proven) in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), because the legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. 
Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as a basis 
for an OVUII conviction under HRS § 291E-61. Nesmith, 2012 WL 
1648974, at *14. Pursuant to Nesmith, we conclude that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing to allege mens rea, but that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficient. Because the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) was entitled to proceed to 
trial against Kawananakoa on the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge. 
The District Court found Kawananakoa guilty of
 
violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). 
Because the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficient and because
 Kawananakoa does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence
 regarding the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge, Kawananakoa's OVUII
 conviction would stand for violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), absent
 error committed at trial.

3. We conclude, however, that the District Court 
committed error at trial by failing to conduct any colloquy as 
required by Tachibana to obtain an on-the-record waiver by Kawananakoa of his right to testify. The State acknowledges that the District Court committed error by failing to conduct a colloquy pursuant to Tachibana, but contends that such error was harmless. We are not persuaded by the State's harmless error argument. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai' i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 
379 (App. 2000) (concluding in a case involving Tachibana error that "it is inherently difficult . . . to divine what effect a violation of the defendant's constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case"). Accordingly, we vacate Kawananakoa's OVUII conviction, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order. 
III.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the May 12, 2011, Judgment of
 
the District Court is vacated with respect to Kawananakoa's
 conviction and sentence for OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) and HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), and the case is remanded for
 further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition
 Order.
