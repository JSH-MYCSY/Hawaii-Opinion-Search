OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
SHAWN FELIPE, Claimant-Appellee-Appellant,
v.
 
CITY & COUNTY OF HONOLULU, HONOLULU EMERGENCY
SERVICES DEPARTMENT, Employer-Appellant-Appellee, Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2007-392 (2-05-00761))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant-Appellant
 
Shawn Felipe (Felipe) appeals from the "Attorney's Fee Approval
 
and Order" (Order) filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 Appeals Board (LIRAB) on June 3, 2011. Felipe sought to have the
 attorney's fees and costs he incurred in defending against the
 appeal to the LIRAB by Employer-Appellee/Self-Insured City and
 County of Honolulu, Honolulu Emergency Services Department
 (Employer) assessed against Employer pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 386-93(b) (Supp. 2012).
1 The LIRAB, however,
 
did not assess Felipe's attorney's fees and costs against
 Employer. Instead, the LIRAB issued the Order which approved

 HRS § 386-93(b) provides in relevant part: 
If an employer appeals a decision of the director or appellate
board, the costs of the proceedings of the appellate board or the
appellate court, together with reasonable attorney's fees, shall be
assessed against the employer if the employer loses[.]
  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$9,160.93 in Felipe's attorney's fees and costs, but only as a
 
lien upon compensation payable by Employer pursuant to HRS 
§ 386-94 (Supp. 2012).

On appeal, Felipe argues that Employer was the loser in
 
its appeal to the LIRAB, and therefore the LIRAB erred in failing
 to assess Felipe's attorney's fees and costs against Employer
 pursuant to HRS § 386-93(b) and in only approving them as a lien
 on compensation. We agree. We vacate the Order and remand the
 case to the LIRAB with instructions to assess the $9,160.93 in
 Felipe's attorney's fees and costs, which the LIRAB found were
 reasonable, against Employer pursuant to HRS § 386-93(b), and not
 as a lien on compensation payable by Employer.

I.
 A.
 
Felipe was employed as a lifeguard (Water Safety 
Officer II) by Employer. On December 17, 2004, while on duty, Felipe was involved in the rescue and attempted resuscitation of a distressed swimmer at Sandy Beach on O' ahu. Despite the 
efforts of Felipe and other rescuers, the swimmer died. Felipe sought treatment with psychologist Jeanne R. Hogan, Ph.D (Dr. 
2 HRS § 386-94 provides in relevant part:
 
Claims for services shall not be valid unless approved by
the director or, if an appeal is had, by the appellate board or
court deciding the appeal. Any claim so approved shall be a lien
upon the compensation in the manner and to the extent fixed by the
director, the appellate board, or the court.
 
In approving fee requests, the director, appeals board, or
court may consider factors such as the attorney's skill and
experience in state workers' compensation matters, the amount of
time and effort required by the complexity of the case, the
novelty and difficulty of issues involved, the amount of fees
awarded in similar cases, benefits obtained for the claimant, and
the hourly rate customarily awarded attorneys possessing similar
skills and experience. In all cases, reasonable attorney's fees
shall be awarded. 
3 Felipe requested a total of $10,162.02 in attorney's fees and costs,
and the LIRAB approved the reduced amount of $9,160.93, as reasonable. On
 appeal, neither Felipe nor Employer challenge the total amount of the
attorney's fees and costs approved by the LIRAB. We therefore affirm the
 LIRAB's determination that $9,160.93 in fees and costs was reasonable.

Hogan), who diagnosed Felipe as suffering from Post Traumatic
 
Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of the drowning incident. 
Felipe subsequently filed a claim for workers' compensation
 benefits.
 
Dr. Hogan initially released Felipe to return to part-
time, light-duty work beginning in April 2005, and Felipe
 returned to work on this basis in April 2005. However, according
 to Dr. Hogan, Felipe suffered recurrences of his PTSD symptoms,
 including those triggered by his involvement in a civil suit
 filed by the deceased swimmer's family, which disabled him from
 returning to work after July 2005 and during 2006. After paying
 Felipe temporary total disability (TTD) benefits and temporary
 partial disability (TPD) benefits in 2005 and 2006, Employer
 requested a medical records review by M.J. Scheinbaum, M.D. (Dr.
 Scheinbaum). In a report dated November 20, 2006, Dr. Scheinbaum
 opined that Felipe's symptoms should have abated within three to
 six months after the drowning incident.
 
By letter dated January 16, 2007, Employer informed
 
Felipe that it intended to terminate his workers' compensation
 benefits effective January 30, 2007. In response, Felipe
 requested a hearing, and on August 3, 2007, the Director of the
 Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) issued a
 decision. Among other things, the Director determined that
 Felipe was entitled to TTD benefits for the periods: 1/15/2005
 through 4/1/2005; 4/17/2005 through 4/22/2005; 5/22/2005 through
 5/27/2005; and 7/31/2005 through 6/12/2007, and that Felipe was
 entitled to TPD benefits for the periods: 4/3/2005 through
 4/16/2005; 4/24/2005 through 5/21/2005; and 5/29/2005 through
 7/30/2005. In reaching this decision, the Director credited 
Dr. Hogan's opinion regarding Felipe's condition and ability to
 work.
 
B. 
On August 22, 2007, Employer appealed the Director's
 
decision to the LIRAB. The issues presented to the LIRAB on
 appeal were:
 
3
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a.	 Whether [Felipe] is entitled to [TTD] benefits, and if
so, what is the period of TTD resulting from the work
injury of December 17, 2004.
 
b.	 Whether [Felipe] is entitled to TPD benefits, and if
so, what is the period of TPD resulting from the work
injury of December 17, 2004.
 
The parties agreed to waive their right to a full
 
evidentiary hearing and have the LIRAB decide the appeal based on
 
their written position statements and the record. In its
 position statement, Employer argued that any TTD or TPD caused by
 Felipe's December 17, 2004, work injury ended by May 31, 2005. 
In support of this argument, Employer cited: (1) the opinion of
 Kyle Boone, Ph.D, who performed an independent medical
 examination of Felipe, that Felipe's reaction to the December 17,
 2004, incident "would have been expected to resolve within six
 months"; (2) Dr. Scheinbaum's opinion that "three to six months
 would have been more than enough for [Felipe's] symptoms to
 signifcant[ly] abate"; and (3) evidence that Felipe had performed
 as a stand-up comedian beginning in May 2005. 
On April 21, 2011, the LIRAB issued its Decision and
 
Order, which modified the Director's decision.
4 The LIRAB
 
affirmed the Director's decision that Felipe was entitled to TTD
 or TPD for the specified periods between January 15, 2005, and
 March 23, 2007. The LIRAB specifically rejected Employer's
 argument that Felipe was not entitled to TTD or TPD for any
 period after May or June of 2005, noting that Employer did not
 object to Felipe's entitlement to TTD or TPD until January 17,
 2007, and that Dr. Hogan's reports supported Felipe's claims for
 TTD and TPD through March 23, 2007. However, the LIRAB
 overturned the Director's determination that Felipe was entitled

 We note that the LIRAB's Decision and Order erroneously states that
the case was before it "on appeal by [Felipe]" of the Director's decision,
whereas the record shows that it was Employer who appealed the Director's
decision.

to TTD for the period between March 23, 2007, and June 12, 2007,5
 
because no certificates of disability to support an award of TTD
 
had been submitted by Felipe's attending physician for this
 period.
 
The LIRAB's Decision and Order was served on Felipe on
 
April 21, 2011. Felipe's attorney submitted an "Amended Request
 for Attorney's Fees," which was dated May 5, 2011, and file-
stamped May 9, 2011. Felipe sought attorney's fees of $9,470.50
 and costs of $234.23, for a total of $10,162.02. Felipe
 specifically requested that "any approved fees be designated as
 payable by the employer pursuant to 386-93(b) as the employer
 appealed the issue of temporary total disability and 'lost.'"
 
On June 11, 2011, the LIRAB issued the Order. The
 
LIRAB determined that attorney's fees and costs in the reduced
 total amount of $9,160.93 were reasonable. The LIRAB approved
 this sum and ordered that "[t]he approved sum is made a lien upon
 compensation payable by Employer. [Felipe] is otherwise
 responsible for payment of the approved amount." Contrary to
 Felipe's request, the LIRAB did not assess the $9,160.93 in
 attorney's fees and costs against Employer pursuant to HRS § 386­93(b). 
II.
 
HRS § 386-93(b) provides in relevant part: 
If an employer appeals a decision of the [D]irector or
[the LIRAB], the costs of the proceedings of the [LIRAB] or
the appellate court, together with reasonable attorney's
fees, shall be assessed against the employer if the employer
loses[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
We conclude that Employer "lost" its appeal of the
 
Director's decision to the LIRAB. Accordingly, pursuant to HRS 
5
 The LIRAB's Decision and Order erroneously states that the Director
determined that Felipe was entitled to TTD benefits through July 12, 2007,
whereas the Director only determined that Felipe was entitled to TTD benefits
through June 12, 2007. The LIRAB's Decision and Order then states that there
 
are no certificates of disability by Felipe's attending physician to support
an award of TTD or TPD between March 23, 2007, and July 12, 2007.
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 386-93(b), Felipe was entitled to have his reasonable
 
attorney's fees and costs assessed against Employer, and the
 LIRAB erred in failing to assess Felipe's approved fees and costs
 against Employer. 
Under HRS § 386-93(b), the winner or prevailing party 
in an appeal is the party that was successful on the crucial or main issue, and the loser of the appeal is the party that was unsuccessful on that issue. See Mitchell v. BWK Joint Venture, 
57 Haw. 535, 550-51, 560 P.2d 1292, 1301 (1977); Survivors of Iida v. Oriental Imports, Inc., 84 Hawai' i 390, 403, 935 P.2d 
105, 118 (App. 1997); see also Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Business Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 620, 575 P.2d 869, 879 (1978) ("[W]here a party prevails on the disputed main issue, even though not to the extent of his original contention, he will be deemed the successful party for the purpose of taxing costs and attorney's fees." (footnote omitted)). 
The crucial or main issue raised by Employer in its
 
appeal of the Director's decision to the LIRAB was whether Felipe
 was entitled to TTD and TPD benefits between January 15, 2005,
 and June 12, 2007, as determined by the Director, based on
 Felipe's December 17, 2004, work injury. On appeal to the LIRAB,
 Employer argued that any TTD or TPD caused by Felipe's December
 17, 2004, work injury ended by May 31, 2005. In other words,
 Employer contested approximately 24 1/2 months (June 1, 2005, to
 June 12, 2007) of TTD and TPD benefits to which the Director had
 determined Felipe was entitled. The LIRAB affirmed the
 Director's determination that Felipe was entitled to TTD and TPD
 benefits with respect to approximately 22 of the 24 1/2 months
 (June 1, 2005, to March 23, 2007) and overturned the Director's
 decision with respect to approximately 2 1/2 months (March 24,
 2007, to June 12, 2007).
6 Under these circumstances, we conclude
 
that Felipe was the prevailing party and Employer was the loser
 in its appeal to the LIRAB under HRS § 386-93(b). 
6
 See footnote 5, supra.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Employer does not seriously contest Felipe's claim that
 
Employer lost its appeal to the LIRAB. Instead, Employer
 
contends that the LIRAB is not required to declare a winner or
 loser in the appeal. Based on this premise, Employer argues that
 because the LIRAB did not specifically declare that Employer lost
 the appeal or that Felipe was the prevailing party, the LIRAB was
 not required to apply HRS § 386-93(b). We disagree.
 
Employer cites no authority to support the proposition 
that the LIRAB can ignore an employee's request for the assessment of attorney's fees and costs and avoid the requirements of HRS § 386-93(b) simply by declining to address whether an employer lost its appeal. In Survivors of Iida, 84 Hawai'i at 403, 935 P.2d at 118, this court stated that "the 
legislature's intent in enacting HRS § 386-93(b), in its simplest form, was to compel employers to shoulder the costs of unsuccessful appeals from workers' compensation decisions, while simultaneously easing the financial burden of claimants who must expend time and resources responding to unsuccessful appeals." We conclude that Employer's contention that the LIRAB could avoid applying HRS § 386-93(b) by declining to address whether Employer lost the appeal is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute and the Legislature's intent in enacting it. Accordingly, we reject Employer's contention and hold that the LIRAB erred in failing to assess Felipe's approved attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $9,160.93 against Employer. 
III.
 
Employer alternatively argues that Felipe's request for 
attorney's fees and costs was untimely under Hawai' i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-55 (1994), and therefore the LIRAB lacked jurisdiction to award or assess attorney's fees and costs. HAR § 12-47-55 provides that a request for approval of fees pursuant to HRS § 386-94 shall be filed within ten calendar days following the LIRAB's filing of a final decision and order. 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The LIRAB filed its Decision and Order on April, 21, 2011. 
Felipe's attorney submitted an Amended Request for Attorney's
 Fees, which was dated May 5, 2011, and filed with the LIRAB on
 May 9, 2011.
7
 
Assuming arguendo that the HAR § 12-47-55 time period
 
for filing applies to requests for the assessment of attorney's
 fees and costs under HRS § 386-93(b), we reject Employer's claim
 that the time period for filing under HAR § 12-47-55 is
 jurisdictional. The jurisdictional requirements for filing an
 appeal with the LIRAB are set forth in HRS § 386-87 (1993), which
 provides that a party seeking to appeal a decision of the
 Director must file a notice of appeal within twenty days after a
 copy of the decision is sent to each party. Employer cites no
 authority to support its jurisdictional claim, and we find no
 basis to conclude that HAR § 12-47-55 imposed a jurisdictional
 limitation on the LIRAB's ability to consider Felipe's request
 for the assessment of attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 386­93(b). Notwithstanding the time limits set forth in HAR § 12-47­55, the LIRAB decided to consider Felipe's request for attorney's
 fees and costs, and we conclude that it was within the LIRAB's
 power to do so.
 
IV.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the LIRAB's 
June 3, 2011, "Attorney's Fee Approval and Order," and we remand
 the case to the LIRAB with instructions to assess the $9,160.93
 in Felipe's attorney's fees and costs, which the LIRAB found were

 Although the document submitted by Felipe's attorney is entitled

that a prior request for attorney's fees was submitted or filed.
