IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JOHN EMERY KNIGHT, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0052; CR. NO. 91-2108)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant John E. Knight (Knight) appeals 
pro se from the Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or 
Correct Illegal Sentence Through a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant 
to [Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40, Filed 
September 13, 2010 (Order Denying Petition), filed on May 27, 
2011, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
Knight raises ten points of error on appeal, including
 
that the Circuit Court erred when it concluded that Knight waived
 
the issues raised herein.
 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides:
 
Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief
thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to
be raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived. 
Except for a claim of illegal sentence, an issue is waived
if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to
raise it and it could have been raised before the trial, at
the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or any

other proceeding actually conducted, or in a prior
proceeding actually initiated under this rule, and the
petitioner is unable to prove the existence of extraordinary
circumstances to justify the petitioner's failure to raise
the issue. There is a rebuttable presumption that a failure
to appeal a ruling or to raise an issue is a knowing and
understanding failure.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The Circuit Court did not err in concluding that the
 
issues were waived herein because Knight did not raise them in
 
S.P.P. No. 09-1-0052, which was dismissed when Knight failed to
 
comply with an order therein directing him to supplement his nonÂ­
conforming petition for post-conviction relief. Knight did not
 
file an appeal from the dismissal of the petition in S.P.P. No.
 
09-1-0052. Nor did Knight argue, much less prove, the existence
 
of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise
 
the issues herein in S.P.P. No. 09-1-0052. Knight provided no
 
facts to rebut the presumption that he knowingly and
 
understandingly failed to raise his present claims in his prior
 
petition. The Circuit Court did not err when it concluded that
 
HRPP Rule 40 proceedings are not available due to Knight's
 
waiver.
 
Accordingly, we need not reach Knight's other arguments
 
on appeal.
 
The Circuit Court's May 27, 2011 Order Denying Petition
 
is affirmed.
