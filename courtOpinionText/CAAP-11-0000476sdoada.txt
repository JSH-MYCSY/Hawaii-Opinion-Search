STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRISTOPHER REID, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-1407)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Christopher Kanoa Reid (Reid)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered
 
1
May 19, 2011 in the Family Court of the First Circuit  (family
court). Reid was found guilty of harassment, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2010).
 
On appeal, among other points, Reid contends the family
 
court erred by denying his "Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject
 
Matter Jurisdiction" (Motion to Dismiss) filed March 2, 2011.
 
During the hearing on Reid's Motion to Dismiss, the
 
family court relied upon Reid's familial status as a household
 
member when it determined that it had jurisdiction over Reid in a

harassment case. In State v. Alagao, 77 Hawai' i 260, 883 P.2d 
682 (App. 1994), this court expressly stated that a defendant's 
status as a family or household member did not satisfy the 
2
subject matter jurisdictional criteria of HRS § 571-14(a)(1)  in
a harassment case. This court stated in Alagao:
 
HRS § 709-906 (Supp. 1992) specifies the offense of
Abuse of Family and Household Members. Alagao was not
charged with that offense. The fact that Alagao was a
"family or household member" for purposes of HRS §
709-906 did not satisfy HRS § 571-14(1)'s subject
matter jurisdiction factual criteria because a "family
or household member" is not by that fact "the child's
parent or guardian or . . . any other person having
the child's legal or physical custody[.]" 
Id. at 263, 883 P.2d at 685.
 
On appeal, the State of Hawai' i concedes that "Reid was 
not [the minor's] parent or guardian, nor did he have legal 
custody of [the minor]." Therefore, the family court could only 
exercise its jurisdiction over Reid if Reid had physical custody 
of the minor at the time of the alleged harassment. 
However, Reid did not have physical custody of the
 
minor at the time of the alleged harassment. In Alagao, this
 
court adopted the definition of physical custody, as defined in
 
HRS § 583-2(8) (1985), as actual possession and control of a
 
child. There was no evidence that Reid exercised actual
 
possession and control of the minor at the time he allegedly
 
kicked the minor.

 HRS § 571-14(a)(1) states:
 
§571-14 Jurisdiction; adults.  (a) Except as
provided in sections 603-21.5 and 604-8, the court
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction:
 
(1) To try any offense committed against a
child by the child's parent or guardian or by any
other person having the child's legal or physical
custody, and any violation of section 707-726,
707-727, 709-902, 709-903, 709-903.5, 709-904,
709-905, 709-906, or 302A-1135, whether or not
included in other provisions of this paragraph or
paragraph (2)[.]
