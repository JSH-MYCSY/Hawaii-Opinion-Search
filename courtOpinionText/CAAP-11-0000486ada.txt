OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Robert Y.H. Kim (Kim) appeals from
 
the "Judgment of Dismissal Without Prejudice" (Judgment) entered
 
3
May 23, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
court). Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants-Appellees
 
Nancy M.S. Kam (N. Kam), Violet M.H. Grady (V. Grady), James Y.B.
 
Kim (J. Kim), Ethel M.B. Kaheaku (E. Kaheaku), and Nora Patterson
 
(N. Patterson) (collectively, Defendants) and against Kim
 
pursuant to, inter alia, the "Order Granting Defendants' Motion
 
for Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs Filed April 4, 2011,"
 
entered May 23, 2011.
 
On appeal, Kim contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion when it awarded attorney's fees and costs pursuant to
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 607-14 (Supp. 2011).4 Kim
 
asserts that his complaint was an action in equity, whereas
 HRS § 607-14 only applies to actions in the nature of assumpsit. 
Kim also contends Defendants were not the prevailing parties
 
because "a judgment of dismissal without prejudice is
 
insufficiently final" to determine the prevailing party.
 
I.
 
On August 5, 1992, Kim and Defendants, along with Betty
 
T.M. Johnson (B. Johnson), entered into an Attorney-Client Fee
 
Contract (1992 Contract) with Matthew S.K. Pyun Jr. (Pyun) to
 
contest their older brother's actions with regards to their
 
deceased mother's real property. Kim and Defendants agreed to

 The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall presided, except where otherwise
noted.

 HRS § 607-14 provides, in relevant part:
 
§607-14 Attorneys' fees in actions in the nature of
assumpsit, etc.  In all the courts, in all actions in the nature
of assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note or other
contract in writing that provides for an attorney's fee, there
shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by the losing party
and to be included in the sum for which execution may issue, a fee
that the court determines to be reasonable[.]

pay Pyun a non-refundable retainer of $45,000 and a contingent
 
fee of 25% of the "gross amount" received through settlement,
 
judgment, or award.
 
After preliminary pre-trial litigation, the parties
 
reached a settlement agreement on March 22, 1993. Based on the
 
appraised value of the recovered properties, Pyun billed Kim and
 
Defendants for $917,529.12. When Kim and Defendants failed to
 
satisfy their debt, Pyun filed suit in circuit court.
 
5
On September 20, 1996, the circuit court  entered final
judgment (1996 Judgment) in favor of Pyun and against N. Kam, J.
 
Kim, the Estate of B. Johnson, and Kim (1996 Defendants) for
 
$
917,529.12. On September 22, 1996, the parties entered into a
 
settlement agreement (1996 Settlement) in which the 1996
 Defendants agreed to pay Pyun a reduced amount of $767,000. The
 
parties agreed that as long as the 1996 Defendants complied with
 
the 1996 Settlement, Pyun would not attempt to enforce the 1996
 
Judgment. But if the 1996 Defendants breached the 1996
 
Settlement, the 1996 Judgment would be immediately enforceable. 
Additionally, the parties agreed that any disputes arising under
 
the 1996 Settlement were to be resolved through mediation and
 
arbitration.
 
The 1996 Defendants paid only $736,000 of the $767,000 
1996 Settlement obligation. In 2006, when Kim tried to refinance 
his personal property, he learned that ten days after the parties 
had reached the 1996 Settlement, Pyun had created a lien against 
Kim's personal property by recording the 1996 Judgment in the 
State of Hawai' i's Bureau of Conveyances. Kim viewed this lien 
as a breach of the 1996 Settlement because Pyun had agreed to take no steps to enforce the 1996 Judgment as long as the 1996 
Defendants were abiding by the 1996 Settlement. Kim filed suit 
against Pyun on March 16, 2007.

 The Honorable Daniel G. Heely presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
All Kim's claims except the one for breach of contract
 
were dismissed or withdrawn. The circuit court referred the
 
breach of contract claim to arbitration as directed under the
 
1996 Settlement. On May 29, 2009, the arbitrator found that Pyun
 
had not breached the 1996 Settlement and issued the Arbitrator's
 
Final Award of $208,791.77. The arbitrator further awarded
 
attorney's fees and costs to Pyun as the prevailing party. These
 
obligations were imposed solely on Kim.
 
On September 30, 2009, the circuit court confirmed the
 
Arbitrator's Final Award and awarded Pyun attorney's fees and
 
costs in the amount of $11,476.28. The circuit court entered
 
judgment in favor of Pyun and against Kim for $220,268.05 (2009
 
Judgment). Kim did not appeal the 2009 Judgment.
 
On November 3, 2010, Kim filed a complaint (November 3,
 
2010 Complaint) in circuit court seeking equitable contribution
 
from Defendants for the 2009 Judgment based on their status as
 
co-obligors under the 1992 Contract, the 1996 Judgment, and the
 
1996 Settlement.
 
The Defendants, individually or with another Defendant,
 
filed a number of motions. On March 29, 2011, the circuit court
 
entered its order granting J. Kim and N. Patterson's motion to
 
dismiss and N. Kam and V. Grady's motion to dismiss. Also on
 
March 29, 2011, the circuit court entered its order granting E.
 
Kaheaku's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
 
On April 4, 2011, Defendants filed "Defendants' Motion
 
for Award for Attorney's Fees and Costs." On May 23, 2011, the
 
circuit court entered its "Order Granting Defendants' Motion for
 
Award for Attorney's Fees and Costs" (Order Granting Fees and
 
Costs) in favor of Defendants in the amount of $17,517.58. On
 
the same day, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of
 
Defendants and against Kim.
 
On June 21, 2011, Kim filed a notice of appeal from the
 
Judgment's confirmation of the Order Granting Fees and Costs.

"The trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees 
and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." 
Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 120 Hawai' i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1242 (2009) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
III.
 
Kim contends his action sounded in equity, not
 
assumpsit, and therefore, the circuit court erred in awarding
 
attorney's fees and costs to Defendants under HRS § 607-14. We
 
agree. 
Generally, under the "American Rule," in the absence of 
a contract or statute, each party is responsible for its own fees 
and costs. Ranger Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw, 103 Hawai' i 26, 31, 79 
P.3d 119, 124 (2003). HRS § 607-14 is a statutory exception, providing that "in all actions in the nature of assumpsit . . . 
there shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by the losing 
party . . ., a fee that the court determines to be reasonable[.]" 
HRS § 607-14 (emphasis added). 
"Assumpsit . . . allows for the recovery of damages for 
the non-performance of a contract, either express or implied, 
written or verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations." 
Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 93 Hawai' i 1, 5, 994 P.2d 1047, 1051 
(2000) (citation omitted, emphasis added). "When the recovery of money damages is not the basis of a claim factually implicating a 
contract, the action is not in the nature of assumpsit." Id. at 
7, 994 P.2d at 1053 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
To ascertain whether an action is in the nature of 
assumpsit, one must look to "the facts and issues raised in the 
complaint, the nature of the entire grievance, and the relief 
sought." Leslie, 93 Hawai' i at 6, 994 P.2d at 1052. "Further, a 
plaintiff's prayer for attorney fees is a significant indication that the action is in assumpsit." Id. 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In Kim's November 3, 2010 Complaint, he did not seek
 
recovery of damages for breach of contract; rather, he sought an
 
equitable contribution from the Defendants under HRS § 483-2
 
6
(Repl. 2008)  for their pro-rata share of the 2009 Judgment.  Kim
 
argued that the 2009 Judgment, which enforced the 1996 Settlement
 
but was imposed solely on him, did not release any of the current
 
Defendants from their co-obligations under the 1992 Contract, the
 
1996 Judgment, or the 1996 Settlement and, therefore, he could
 
seek equitable contribution from them.
 "[E]quitable contribution is the right to recover from
 
a co-obligor that shares liability with the party seeking
 
contribution[.]" Crowley Maritime Corp. v. Boston Old Colony
 
Ins. Co., 70 Cal. Rptr. 3d 605, 609 (2008); see also Sound Built
 
Homes, Inc. v. Windermere Real Estate/South, Inc., 118 Wash. App.
 
617, 633-34, 72 P.3d 788, 797 (2003) ("[C]ontribution between or
 
among contractual co-obligors is based upon the equitable
 
principles that, where several parties are equally liable for the
 
same debt and one is compelled to pay the whole of it, he may
 
have contribution against the others to obtain from them the
 
payment of their respective shares." (internal quotation marks
 
omitted.)). "The right to contribution arises when, as between
 
multiple parties jointly bound to pay a sum of money, one party
 
is compelled to pay the entire sum. That party may then assert a
 
right of contribution against the others for their proportionate
 
share of the common obligation." 18 Am. Jur. 2d Contribution §5
 
(2004). "Contribution is not founded on contract and is not
 
contractual in nature[.]" Id. at §4; see also American States
 
Ins. Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d
 177, 182 (2011).

 HRS § 483-2 provides:
 
§483-2 Co-obligor not discharged when.  A judgment against
one or more of several obligors, or against one or more of joint,
or of joint and several obligors shall not discharge a co-obligor
who was not a party to the proceeding wherein the judgment was
rendered.

Kim's complaint was not an equitable claim in the 
nature of assumpsit, seeking relief in the form of rescission and 
restitution. See Leslie, 93 Hawai' i at 7, 994 P.2d at 1053; see 
also Hong v. Kong, 5 Haw. App. 174, 683 P.2d 833 (1984) (holding that a claim for rescission and restitution was an action in the 
nature of assumpsit arising from a promise implied by law to 
prevent unjust enrichment). Neither was it a claim of unjust 
enrichment, which would constitute "an equity action within the 
realm of assumpsit." Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai' i 42, 66, 169 P.3d 
994, 1018 (App. 2007). 
Although Kim and Defendants' status as co-obligors 
arose out of a contract they entered with Pyun, Kim was not seeking recovery of damages under a contract -- there was no 
contract between Kim and Defendants. Likewise, Kim was not 
alleging or seeking redress for quasi-contractual obligations 
under the theory of unjust enrichment. The mere fact that the 
underlying 1992 Contract and 1996 Settlement formed the basis for 
Kim's claim for equitable contribution did not render his claim 
an assumpsit action. TSA Intern. Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 
Hawai'i 243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 734 (1999). 
Moreover, Kim's complaint alleges that the arbitrator
 
awarded interest on the outstanding obligation under the 1996
 Settlement Agreement and also awarded attorney's fees and costs
 
to Pyun as the prevailing party. The complaint indicates that
 
these amounts for interest, attorney's fees and costs were
 
ultimately included in the 2009 Judgment, for which Kim seeks
 
contribution from the Defendants. These amounts for interest,
 
attorney's fees and costs do not arise from any contractual
 
obligation, but rather from Kim's litigation with Pyun.
 
Thus, based on the facts and issues raised in Kim's
 
November 3, 2010 Complaint, the nature of the grievance, and the
 
relief sought, we conclude that the "essential character of the
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
underlying action" was one of equitable contribution under 
HRS § 483-2 and was not an action in the nature of assumpsit 
under HRS § 607-14. See Leslie, 93 Hawai' i at 5, 994 P.2d at 
1051. Therefore, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting Defendants an award of attorney's fees and 
costs. Having so concluded, we need not address Kim's second 
point of error regarding the meaning of "prevailing party." 
IV.
 
The Judgment of Dismissal Without Prejudice entered 
May 23, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is vacated
 
in part and affirmed in part. We vacate the Judgment with
 
respect to the "Order Granting Defendants' Motion for Award of
 
Attorney's Fees and Costs Filed April 4, 2011," entered May 23,
 
2011. The Judgment is affirmed in all other respects.
