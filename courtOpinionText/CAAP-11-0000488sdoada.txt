NO. CAAP-11-0000488
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
COUNTY OF HAWAI' I, a municipal corporation
of the State of Hawai' i, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ABEL SIMEONA LUI, et al., Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3RC11-1-131K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Abel Simeona Lui (Lui) appeals from
 
the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion For Summary Judgment"
 
entered June 15, 2011 in the District Court of the Third Circuit1
 
(district court).
 
Lui claims Plaintiff-Appellee County of Hawai' i 
(County) does not have legal title to a parcel of real property located at Kawa, Ka' u, Hawai' i (Property) and instead claims he is 
the rightful owner. Lui claims to have occupied the Property (consisting of two parcels) since he moved to the Island of 
Hawai'i in approximately 1987-1988. 
In 1983, Thomas Okuna (Okuna), the owner of the
 
Property at that time, filed a Complaint to Quiet Title of the

Property. Five years later, in 1988, a Decree Quieting Title was
 
entered. The decree determined conclusively who owned the
 
Property and who had rights to access the Property. Lui is not
 
an individual with any interest in the Property.
 
After quieting title, Okuna filed an ejectment action 
(Thomas M. Okuna v. Abel Lui, et al., Civil No. 01-246 KU, 
District Court of the Third Circuit, State of Hawai' i) against 
Lui and several other people who were illegally occupying the Property. The district court determined that Okuna was entitled 
to immediate and exclusive possession of the Property and issued 
a Judgment for Ejectment and Writ of Possession against Lui (and 
all persons holding under or through him). Okuna sold the 
Property in 2005 to Waihinou Dreams, LLC (Waihinou Dreams) and in 
2008, the County purchased one of the parcels from Waihinou 
Dreams. 
On February 22, 2011, the County filed a Complaint for
 
Ejectment against Lui. On May 3, 2011, the County filed a Motion
 
for Summary Judgment. On June 15, 2011, the district court
 
entered the "Order Granting [County's] Motion for Summary
 
Judgment."
 
The appellate court reviews "the [district] court's 
grant or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. 
Thronas, 107 Hawai' i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting 
Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 490, 501, 
100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions onfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that thereis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that themoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effectof establishing or refuting one of the essential elements ofa cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to thenon-moving party. In other words, we must view all of theevidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the lightmost favorable to the party opposing the motion.

Querubin, 107 Hawai' i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawai' i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Lui's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
There are no genuine issues as to any material fact,
 
and the County was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion For Summary Judgment" entered June 15, 2011 in
 the District Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
