APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KA
'Û DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC11-1-195K)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth, Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This consolidated appeal of CAAP-11-0000489, 
CAAP-11-0000629, and CAAP-11-0001026 arises out of an action for 
ejectment in the District Court of the Third Circuit, Ka' û 
Division 1 (the district court). Defendants-Appellants Abel Lui 
(Lui), Han Phua (Phua), Shelley Stephens Mahi (Mahi) 
2
(collectively, Defendants), and Kittrena L. Morgan (Morgan)  seek
to appeal from: (1) the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment" (MSJ Order) entered on June 15, 2011 by the
 
district court; and (2) the Judgment for Possession (Judgment)
 
and Writ of Possession (Writ) entered July 12, 2011 by the
 
district court. 
The district court entered the MSJ Order,
 
Judgment, and Writ in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Edmund C.
 Olson, Trustee of the Edmund C. Olson Trust No. 2, U/A Dated
 
August 21, 1985 (Olson) and against Defendants.
 
Olson's complaint alleges that he is the current legal 
owner of real property located in Kâ
wâ, Ka'û, Hawai' i (Tax Map Key 
(TMK) No. (3) 9-5-016:006) (the Property). The Defendants also claim ownership of the Property and/or the right to occupy the 
Property. 
The Property has been the subject of previous
 
litigation. In 1988, a Decree Quieting Title was entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ruling that Thomas M. Okuna
 
(Okuna) was the fee simple owner of several parcels of land,
 
including the Property. Subsequently, in 2005, Okuna sold the
 
Property to Olson, as reflected in a Deed recorded in the Bureau
 
of Conveyances.

 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo Jr. presided.

 Morgan was not a party in the district court proceedings, but was
listed as a co-appellant with Mahi in the notice of appeal for CAAP-11-000489.
As a non-party to the district court proceedings, Morgan has no standing toappeal. Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai' i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the current litigation, on March 17, 2011, Olson
 
filed a Complaint for Ejectment against Defendant Lui and others
 
in Civil No. 3RC11-1-195K.
 
On April 12, 2011, Olson filed a Motion for Summary
 
Judgment. The district court heard the motion on May 17, 2011,
 
and granted the motion on June 15, 2011. The basis for granting
 
summary judgment was that Olson's right to the Property, and the
 
Defendants' lack of interest in the Property, had been
 
conclusively established by previous decisions, including the
 
1988 Decree Quieting Title. On July 12, 2011, the district court
 
entered the Judgment and issued the Writ in favor of Olson.
 
The appellate court reviews "the [district] court's 
grant or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. 
Thronas, 107 Hawai' i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting 
Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 490, 501, 
100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Querubin, 107 Hawai' i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawai' i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve the appeals as
 
follows.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
I. CAAP-11-0000489
 
Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000489 arises from a notice of 
appeal filed on June 16, 2011 by Mahi and non-party Morgan, as 
well as Lui's notice of appeal filed on June 20, 2011. These 
notices of appeal were filed after the district court's 
announcement on June 15, 2011 that it would enter a judgment of 
possession and writ of possession, but prior to the filing of the 
appealable Judgment and Writ.3 Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(2), these notices of appeal were deemed filed immediately after the Judgment and Writ became 
final. Thus, these notices of appeal were timely. 
However, because Morgan was not a party in the district 
court proceedings, she has no standing to appeal. Abaya, 112 
Hawai'i at 181, 145 P.3d at 724. Therefore, the appeal in No. 
CAAP-11-0000489 is dismissed as to Morgan. 
Only Mahi filed an opening brief with regard to
 
No. CAAP-11-0000489. Mahi's opening brief asserts, among other
 
things, that Lui and his family have rights to the Property
 
through Lui's ancestors.
4 However, Mahi's brief provides no
 
discernible argument challenging the district court's grant of
 summary judgment in favor of Olson, upon which the Judgment and
 
Writ are based. Based on our de novo review, there are no
 
genuine issues of material fact and the district court did not
 
err in granting summary judgment in favor of Olson.
 
3
 The Judgment and Writ were appealable pursuant to Forgay v. Conrad, 
47 U.S. 201 (1848) and Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704
(1995).
4
 Although Mahi's opening brief addresses the question of title to the
Property, the Defendants did not raise a defense to the district court's
jurisdiction. That is, Defendants did not present a written answer or written
motion accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the source, nature and extent
of their claimed title with particularity, as required by Rule 12.1 of the
District Court Rules of Civil Procedure
. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. 
Peelua, 126 Hawai' i 32, 265 P.3d 1128 (2011).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
II. CAAP-11-0000629
 
Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000629 is based on Lui's notice of
 
appeal filed on August 25, 2011. We lack jurisdiction to review
 
this appeal because it was not timely filed. The August 25, 2011
 
notice of appeal was not filed within thirty days of the July 12,
 
2011 Judgment and Writ, as required by HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal is a
 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 
discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1129 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
 authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 
Rule 4 of these rules."). Thus, we lack jurisdiction over this
 
appeal.
 
III. CAAP-11-0001026
 
Appeal No. CAAP-11-0001026 is based on Phua's notice of
 
appeal filed on December 2, 2011. We also lack jurisdiction to
 
review Phua's appeal because it was not timely filed. Phua's
 
December 2, 2011 notice of appeal was not filed within thirty
 
days of the July 12, 2011 Judgment and Writ, as required by HRAP
 
Rule 4(a)(1). Thus, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. 
Bacon, 68 Haw. 648, 727 P.2d 1127; HRAP Rule 26(b).
 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, appeal No. CAAP-11-0000629 and
 
No. CAAP-11-0001026 are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
As to appeal No. CAAP-11-0000489, Morgan's appeal is
 
dismissed because she had no standing to appeal. As to the
 
remainder of the appeal, the Judgment for Possession and Writ of 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Possession, both entered on July 12, 2011 in the District Court 
of the Third Circuit, Ka' û Division, are affirmed.
