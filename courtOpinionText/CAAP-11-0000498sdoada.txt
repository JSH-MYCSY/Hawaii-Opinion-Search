APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0233(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Sarah Nakihei and Abner Nakihei
 
(collectively, the Nakiheis) appeal from the order denying the 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nakiheis' motions (1) to set aside default and (2) to reconsider
 
and vacate the order granting summary judgment and decree of
 
1
 which was filed in the
 foreclosure (Order Denying Motions),
2
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court)  on June 6,
2011. 
On appeal, the Nakiheis argue that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying their "Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default"
 (Motion to Set Aside Default) because the entry of default
 against the Nakiheis was improper and because the Nakiheis
 satisfied the test set forth in 
BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57
 
Haw. 73, 549 P.2d 1147 (1976), for setting aside the default. 
The Nakiheis also argue that the Circuit Court erred in denying
 their "Motion to Reconsider and Vacate Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure against all Defendants
 on Complaint filed March 24, 2009" (Motion to Vacate Summary
 Judgment).
 
I. 
We resolve the issues raised by the Nakiheis on appeal
 
as follows:
 
1. Before applying the BDM, Inc. test for setting 
aside a default, we must first decide whether the entry of default was improper. See Long v. Long, 101 Hawai' i 400, 407, 69 
P.3d 528, 535 (App. 2003). "Otherwise, a court could impose the BDM, Inc. burden upon a defendant simply by abusing its discretion and entering a default against the defendant." Id. 
1
 The full title of this order is "Order Denying (1) Defendants Sarah
Nakihei and Abner Nakihei's Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default filed
December 15, 2010 and (2) Defendants Sarah Nakihei and Abner Nakihei's Motion
to Reconsider and Vacate Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
Against All Defendants on Complaint filed March 24, 2009, filed December 15,
2010."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the declaration supporting Plaintiff's request to
 
the clerk of the Circuit Court for entry of default against the
 
Nakiheis, counsel for Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National
 Association, as Trustee for the BNC Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2
 (U.S. Bank), represented that the Nakiheis had "failed to answer or otherwise appear in this action within twenty (20) days after the service of the Complaint[.]" Counsel's declaration failed to disclose and acknowledge that, in response to the complaint filed by U.S. Bank, the Nakiheis, proceeding pro se, filed a "Verified Courtesy Notice of Objection to Plaintiff's Irregular Action and Request for the Ratification of Commencement" (Notice of Objection). We conclude that, notwithstanding any irregularities in the substance and form of the Notice of Objection, the Nakiheis' filing of the Notice of Objection and U.S. Bank's failure to disclose and acknowledge it in requesting entry of default rendered the clerk's entry of default against the Nakiheis improper, and that the Circuit Court erred in denying the Nakiheis' Motion to Set Aside Default. See Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rules 12 and 55(a) and (c) (2000). Given our analysis, we need not address the Nakiheis' alternative argument that the Circuit Court erred in denying their Motion to Set Aside Default because they satisfied the test set forth in BDM, Inc. 
2. The entry of default against the Nakiheis
 
precluded them from contesting the Bank's motion for summary
 judgment and decree of foreclosure. See Bank of Hawaii v.
 
Horwoth, 71 Haw. 204, 216, 787 P.2d 674, 681 (1990). Because the
 entry of default against the Nakiheis was improper, we conclude
 that the Circuit Court also erred in denying the Nakiheis' Motion
 to Vacate Summary Judgment.
