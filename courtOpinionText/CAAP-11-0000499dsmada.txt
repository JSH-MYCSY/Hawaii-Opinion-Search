Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Joan Margaret Bihn (Appellant), proceeding pro se,
 
filed a notice of appeal on June 27, 2011. The record on appeal
 was not filed. On March 2, 2012, the appellate clerk notified
 Appellant that the record on appeal was in default. The notice
 stated as follows:
 
You filed a notice of appeal in the above entitled matter on 27­
Jun-2011. On 14-Sep-2011, the plaintiff-appellee notified this
court that there was a notice of entry of order granting relief
from automatic stay for the bankruptcy proceeding. Therefore,
pursuant to HRAP [Rule] 54(a), the time for docketing the record
on appeal expired on 14-Nov-2011.
