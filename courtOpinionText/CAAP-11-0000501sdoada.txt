SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
On June 28, 2011, Defendants-Appellants Richard A.
 
Bellah ("Bellah"), Conrado Ombao, Clara Ombao, and Eliosa O.
 
Bellah (collectively, "Appellants") appealed pro se from the
 "Order Denying Petition in Praecipe by Declaration in Special
 Visitation for Mandatory Judicial of Facts on Non-Consent and
 Non-Agreement of and for Relief from the Void and Amending Order
 Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale
 of Property at Public Auction, Directing Distribution of Proceeds
 and for a Writ of Ejectment," filed on May 31, 2011 ("Order
 Denying Petition for Relief") in the Circuit Court of the Third
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit ("Circuit Court").1 The Order Denying Petition for
 
Relief addressed the February 8, 2011 petition for relief under
 
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 60(b) ("Petition
 for Relief"), which asked the Circuit Court to set aside its
 April 28, 2010 judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank
 National Association, as Trustee for MASTR Asset Backed
 Securities Trust 2006-NC1 ("U.S. Bank"), entering a foreclosure
 decree concerning certain residential property owned by
 Appellants in the Kona Palisades subdivision. 
On November 17, 2011, Appellants filed an Amended
 
Notice of Appeal, in which they appealed from the Circuit Court's
 (1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed August 19, 2008, filed
 April 28, 2010 ("FOF/COL"); (2) Judgment on Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants
 on Complaint Filed August 19, 2008, filed April 28, 2010
 ("Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure"); (3) Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Permission to Sell Property Without Open
 Houses, filed October 20, 2010 ("Order Granting Permission to
 Sell"); (4) Order Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming
 Commissioner's Sale of Property at Public Auction, Directing
 Distribution of Proceeds and for a Writ of Ejectment, filed March
 15, 2011 ("Order Confirming Sale"); (5) Judgment on Order
 Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale
 of Property at Public Auction, Directing Distribution of Proceeds
 and for a Writ of Ejectment, filed March 15, 2011 ("Judgment
 Confirming Sale"); (6) Writ of Ejectment, filed March 15, 2011;
 and (7) Order Denying Petition for Relief, filed May 31, 2011. 
On appeal, Appellants assert the following points of
 
error in the form of "Questions Presented":
 
A.	 Whether or not there was a true and legal assignment of
mortgage from American Loan Servicing of America/New Century
Mortgage Corporation to [U.S. Bank]?, and Whether [U.S.
Bank] and/or the commissioner had legal title, interest and
authority to sell the subject real property at issue?

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
B.	 Whether or not []Appellants had Seisen or legal title and
possession of the subject real property at issue? Whether
 the recorded Baptismal Deed established title, ownership and
interest of the subject real property to []Appellants? And
 Whether or not the commissioner had legal authority to
consent to record a deed over []Appellants' Baptismal Deed?
 
C.	 Whether or not the subject property in an Estate property at
issue was owned by the Kingdom of Hawaii?
 
D.	 Whether or not the [Circuit] Court erred in granting [U.S. Bank's]
Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
Defendants on Complaint filed August 19, 2088 [sic]?
 
Upon careful review of the records and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments that they advance and the issues that they raise,
 we resolve the points of error as follows and affirm:
 
I.	 Jurisdiction. 
As a preliminary matter, this court does not have 
jurisdiction over all filings implicated by Appellants on appeal. 
Accordingly, we raise the issue here sua sponte. See Ditto v. 
McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) ("When we 
perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal." (quoting Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d
 936, 937 (1986)) (brackets and internal quotation marks
 omitted)). 
We have jurisdiction over Appellants' appeal from the 
Order Denying Petition for Relief, which the Circuit Court entered on May 31, 2011, less than thirty days before Appellants filed their first Notice of Appeal on June 28, 2011. See Haw. R. 
App. P. 4(a)(1) (2012); Beneficial Hawai
'i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 
Hawai'i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 359, 365 (2002) (holding that when an 
"HRCP Rule 60(b) motion pertain[s] exclusively to a foreclosure decree[,] seek[ing] to relieve the movant of its effect . . . the circuit court's entry of judgment disposing of such [an] HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is a final, appealable order."). 
We lack jurisdiction, however, over any appeal taken
 
from the FOF/COL, the Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure, or the
 Judgment Confirming Sale as Appellants did not timely file for
 
3
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal within thirty days from their entry.2 Similarly, 
Appellants did not timely appeal from the Order Granting 
Permission to Sell, the Order Confirming Sale, or the Writ of Ejectment. See Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 
130 Hawai
'i 11, 16, 304 P.3d 1192, 1197 (2013) (explaining that 
orders confirming sale are separately appealable from decrees of foreclosure and fall within the second part of foreclosure proceedings, "all other orders"); Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). As such, we lack appellate jurisdiction over those matters.
3 Ditto, 
103 Hawai 'i at 157, 80 P.3d at 978. 
Furthermore, only Bellah has standing to appeal from 
the Order Denying Petition for Relief. For, absent standing, an appellate court is without jurisdiction to consider an appeal. Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai
'i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001). 
And, in this case, Bellah is the only Appellant who ever appeared before the Circuit Court.
4 Furthermore, since Bellah was the 
only person named in the Circuit Court's Order Denying Petition for Relief, he is the only Appellant "who is affected or prejudiced by the appealable order." Abaya v. Mantell, 112 
Hawai
'i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) (quoting Kepo 'o v. 
Watson, 87 Hawai 'i 91, 95, 952 P.2d 379, 383 (1998)). 
Therefore, Appellants other than Bellah lack standing
 
to appeal the Order Denying Petition for Relief, and the
 following discussion is limited accordingly.
 
2 The Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure require that "[w]hen a
civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 
30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." Haw. R. App. P.
4(a)(1) (emphasis added). 
3 Furthermore, Appellants' HRCP Rule 60(b) Petition for Relief
cannot be construed as an HRCP Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure because, in order for a Rule 60(b) motion
to be construed as a Rule 59(e) motion, it must be filed within ten days of
the entry of judgment. Simpson v. Dep't of Land & Natural Res., 8 Haw. App.
16, 21, 791 P.2d 1267, 1272 (1990), overruled on other grounds by Kaniakapupu
 
v. Land Use Comm'n, 111 Hawai' i 124, 135, 139 P.3d 712, 723 (2006). 
4
 As for some of the other individuals named in the Complaint,
Bellah purported to represent them in their absence. Since Bellah is not 
licensed to practice law in Hawai' i, however, he can only represent himself in
a pro se capacity before the court. See HAW. REV. STAT. §§ 605-2, -14 (1993);
Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590P.2d 570, 573 (1979).

II.	 The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying the Petition for Relief.
 
The Petition for Relief appears to assert that the
 
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure was void because there were
 
numerous genuine issues of material fact which should have
 prevented the Circuit Court from granting summary judgment to
 U.S. Bank. Accordingly, movants asked the Circuit Court to set aside its order granting summary judgment and the corresponding Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure. Because Bellah did not timely appeal from the Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure, however, we cannot review the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment in this case. Instead, we review the Circuit Court's Order Denying Petition for Relief under the abuse of discretion standard for an HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion. Casey, 98 
Hawai
'i at 164, 45 P.3d at 364. For the reasons stated below, we 
find that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by issuing that order. 
First, Bellah challenges the assignment of the mortgage
 
from American Loan Servicing of America/New Century Mortgage
 Corporation to U.S. Bank and questions whether U.S. Bank was the
 trustee or holder of the corresponding promissory note. In
 support, Bellah contends that U.S. Bank failed to produce the
 original mortgage or loan documents to the Circuit Court as
 evidentiary proof supporting U.S. Bank's motion for summary
 judgment and decree of foreclosure. Bellah, however, does not
 explain why HRCP Rule 60(b) entitles him to relief for such a
 failure. Bellah does not appear to contend, and in any event has
 not shown, that any of the bases for relief provided in HRCP Rule
 60(b)(1)-(6) apply in this case.

 HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part:
 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect, (2) newly discovered evidence which by due
diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for
a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore
denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or
other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is
void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Second, Bellah contends that he had both legal title to
 
the Kona Palisades property and also an interest superior to any
 
held by U.S. Bank. Bellah maintains that he presented material
 evidence of his superior interest to the Circuit Court. This
 argument, however, relates back to the Circuit Court's Judgment
 and Decree of Foreclosure, which was not timely appealed from,
 and Bellah does not allege newly discovered evidence pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 60(b)(2). Moreover, the Circuit Court explicitly
 discredited the documents Bellah cites to in support of this
 argument. Indeed, in FOF 5, the court stated:
 
Also subsequent to the execution of the Note and
Mortgage, Defendants OMBAO and BELLAH caused to be recorded
Document Number 2007-088612 entitled "The Affidavit Of Truth
 In Full Payment In Accord And Satisfaction By the honorable
discharge Of that Certain Account of OCWEN LOAN SERVICING
Number 0038494118 and that Certain Account AMERICA'S
 SERVICING COMPANY Number 1146007325," and Document Number
2007-093755 entitled "Part One. non-Statutory Baptismal of
the Eternally-Covenanted Purchased Possession; Part Two.
Non-Statutory Notice of and Common Law Lien". The documents
 falsely claim that [U.S. Bank's] mortgage has been paid in
full and attempt to place a lien upon the property in favor
of Defendants OMBAO and BELLAH. These Documents have no
 legal validity and are subordinate to [U.S. Bank's]
Mortgage." 
Bellah provides no reason why we should now credit this evidence,
 
or why the Circuit Court improperly discredited this evidence a
 second time when it denied his Petition for Relief. 
Third, Bellah appears to allege that the Kona Palisades 
property does not fall within the jurisdiction of the State of Hawai
'i. His opening brief contains no discernible argument on 
this point of error, however, so it is deemed waived on appeal. Taomae v. Lingle, 108 Hawai
'i 245, 257, 118 P.3d 1188, 1200 
(2005) (points of error may be disregarded when appellant fails to present discernible arguments in support). 
For the foregoing reasons, Bellah did not establish
 
that he was entitled to any relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
5(...continued)
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has

been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment.
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 60(b).

Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Denying Petition in
 
Praecipe by Declaration in Special Visitation for Mandatory

 Relief from the Void and Amending Order Approving Report of
 Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale of Property at

 of Ejectment, filed on May 31, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the
 Third Circuit, is affirmed.
