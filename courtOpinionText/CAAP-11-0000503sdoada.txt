IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

GENEVIEVE CHANEL BRUFF, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHRISTOPHER JAMES BRUFF, Defendant-Appelant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 09-1-2791)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this post-divorce decree proceeding, Defendant-
Appellant Christopher James Bruff (Christopher), pro se, appeals
 
from the "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration filed May 24,
 
2011" (Order) entered June 6, 2011 in the Family Court of the
 
1
First Circuit  (family court).  In the Order, family court denied
 
Christopher's motion for reconsideration of the May 11, 2011
 
order (May 11, 2011 Order), in which family court found no
 
material change in circumstances and determined that the February
 
2, 2011 order (February 2, 2011 Order) would "remain in full
 
force and effect." The February 2, 2011 Order denied
 
Christopher's request for sole legal and physical custody to his
 
two minor children and awarded sole legal and physical custody to
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Genevieve Chanel Ensminger, also known as
 
Genevieve Chanel Bruff and Genevieve Chanel Jefferson
 
(Genevieve).
 
On appeal, Christopher asks this court to vacate the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
May 11, 2011 Order and remand for a hearing on Christopher's
 
request for a change in custody. Christopher also appears to ask
 
this court to conclude that family court violated the Judicial
 
Code of Conduct, in that it was biased in not allowing a fair and
 
impartial hearing.

Christopher's opening brief  does not comply with
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) in nearly 
every respect. The brief contains no subject index or table of authorities as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(1). In fact, 
Christopher fails to cite to any authority whatsoever. He also 
fails to provide record references as required by HRAP Rule 
28(b)(3). Furthermore, Christopher fails to provide a concise 
statement of the points of error, where in the record the errors 
occurred, and where in the record the errors were objected to or 
brought to the attention of the court, in violation of HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4). 
This court could refuse to consider Christopher's 
appeal as a sanction for his noncompliance. 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) 
(“Points not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may 
notice a plain error not presented.”). However, because we 
adhere to the policy of hearing a case on its merits where 
possible, we review this case for any meritorious claims. 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995). 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
submitted and having given due consideration to the arguments
 advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant statutory
 
and case law, we conclude Christopher's appeal is without merit.
 
On appeal, Christopher appears to argue that the May
 
11, 2011 Order should be reconsidered because it was based on the
 
February 2, 2011 Order, which Christopher contends "contained
 
2

false information awarding the sole physical and legal custody to
 
[Genevieve]." He asserts that at the February 2, 2011 hearing,
 
there was no discussion about child custody, only about
 
visitation, even though the hearing was scheduled pursuant to his
 
motion for a change in custody. He argues that at the May 11,
 
2011 review hearing, family court improperly relied on the
 
allegedly falsified February 2, 2011 Order to refuse to allow him
 
to introduce evidence and witnesses. He suggests these actions
 
indicated a biased court. Christopher contends family court
 
indicated its bias by not allowing him to present evidence to
 
show a material change in circumstances and as a result, he was
 
denied a fair and impartial hearing.
 
In essence, it appears Christopher's motion for 
reconsideration of the May 11, 2011 Order is actually a motion 
for family court to reconsider the February 2, 2011 Order, which 
awarded sole legal and physical custody to Genevieve. If viewed 
as a motion for reconsideration of February 2, 2011 Order, 
Christopher's motion is untimely because "a motion to reconsider 
. . . may be filed no later than 10 days after entry of the 
judgment or order[.]" Hawai' i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 59 
(e). A motion for reconsideration of the February 2, 2011 Order was long overdue. 
But even if the motion is properly a motion for 
reconsideration of the May 11, 2011 Order, family court exercises 
wide discretion in granting or denying a motion for 
reconsideration, which will not be reversed on appeal unless 
family court abuses its discretion. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 
80 Hawai' i 225, 231, 909 P.2d 553, 559 (1995). A family court 
decision will not be set aside "unless the family court 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 
Hawai'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (quoting In re Doe, 95 
Hawai'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 (2001)). "Furthermore, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the burden of establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, 
and a strong showing is required to establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 
102 Hawai' i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
In any proceeding "where there is at issue a dispute as 
to the custody of a minor child, the court . . . may make an 
order for the custody of the minor child as may seem necessary or 
proper." Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-46 (Supp. 2011). 
Custody is awarded "according to the best interests of the 
child[.]" Id., see also Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai' i 144, 155, 44 P.3d 
1085, 1096 (2002) ("A guiding principle for family courts in awarding custody under Hawai' i law is the best interests of the 
child."). 
A custody order may be modified at any time during the
 
minority of a child. See HRS § 571-50 ("[A]ny decree or order of
 
the court may be modified at any time."); see also HRS § 571­
46(6) (1993 & Supp. 2011) ("Any custody award shall be subject to
 
modification or change whenever the best interests of the child
 
require or justify the modification or change[.]"). (Emphasis
 
added.) Furthermore, to change custody, the movant "must show a
 
material change of circumstances since the previous custody
 
order, and must show that such a change of custody is in the best
 
interest of the child." Nadeau v. Nadeau, 10 Haw. App. 111, 121,
 
861 P.2d 754, 759 (1993).
 
A showing of a material change in circumstances
 
generally hinges on the testimony of the parties and other
 appropriate individuals. 
[T]he question on appeal is whether the record contains
substantial evidence supporting the family court's
determinations, and appellate review is thereby limited to
assessing whether those determinations are supported by
credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value.
In this regard, the testimony of a single witness, if found
by the trier of fact to have been credible, will suffice.

(2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “[I]t is 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues 
dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the 
evidence[.]” Inoue v. Inoue, 118 Hawai' i 86, 101, 185 P.3d 834, 
849 (App. 2008). 
Christopher failed to provide a transcript of the 
February 2, 2011 hearing. "The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and 
he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate 
transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (quoting Union Building Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87
 
(1984) (citing State v. Goers, 61 Haw. 198, 600 P.2d 1142 (1979). 
Because the transcript of the February 2, 2011 hearing is not
 
part of the record on appeal, we have no basis upon which to
 
review family court's decisions made on February 2, 2011;
 
therefore, we leave those decisions undisturbed.
 
Christopher did provide a partial transcript of the May 
11, 2011 review hearing. At that hearing, family court stated 
that Christopher failed to present evidence on February 2, 2011 
or May 11, 2011 to show a material change in circumstances. 
Additionally, family court noted that, even though Christopher 
has visitation rights, he had not seen his young children in over 
15 months. Family court stated it would not be in the children's 
best interests to fly them from their home in Texas to Hawai' i 
"to stay with somebody they haven't seen in 15 months[.]" Family court was also reminded by Genevieve that at the February 2, 2011 
hearing, "there was a colloquy with [Christopher] at the time 
about his situation vis-a-vis the suicides [attempts], the 
distance, the contact, and the issues." Family court continued 
the existing orders and suggested Christopher "try and coordinate 
supervised visits in Texas or wait until [the children] get 
older." 
At the May 11, 2011 hearing, family court considered
 
the best interests of the children, found there was no material
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
change in circumstances, and continued the existing order which
 
awarded sole legal and physical custody to Genevieve. 
Christopher offered no evidence to show a material change in
 
circumstances, only stating that he wanted to bring in character
 
witnesses. Without a showing of a material change of
 
circumstances and a showing that a change in custody was in the
 
best interests of the children, family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in continuing the existing orders and in denying
 
Christopher's motion for reconsideration.
 
Christopher also argues that family court was biased 
against him. However, he made no motion to disqualify family 
court and otherwise did not comply with HRS § 601-7(b) (1993). 
"[A] party asserting grounds for disqualification must timely 
present the objection, either before the commencement of the 
proceeding or as soon as the disqualifying facts become known." 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Au, 107 Hawai' i 327, 338, 113 
P.3d 203, 214 (2005) (quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 122, 9 P.3d 409, 434 (2000)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Christopher failed to timely object and we decline to review his contention on appeal. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying Motion for
 
Reconsideration filed May 24, 2011" entered June 6, 2011 in the
 Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
