STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RANDOLPH GOLDMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTI-10-144505)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not 
have jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Randolph Goldman's 
(Appellant) appeal from the Honorable Randall Shintani's December 1, 2010 judgment for the offense of violating longitudinal traffic lane markings in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-38 (2007), because Appellant's appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP). 
An appellate court has an independent obligation to 
ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exits. State v. Graybeard,
 
93 Hawai' i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). We note that 
violating longitudinal traffic lane markings in violation of HRS
 
1
§ 291C-38 (2007) is punishable by a fine,  and, thus, constitutes
a "'[t]raffic infraction' . . . for which the prescribed
 penalties do not include imprisonment." HRS § 291D-2 (1993). 
"No traffic infraction shall be classified as a criminal
 offense." HRS § 291D-3(a) (2007). Under HRS Chapter 291D,
 contested traffic citations are adjudicated at a hearing before a
 district court. An adjudication in favor of the State may be
 followed by a trial de novo before the district court conducted
 "pursuant the Hawaii rules of evidence and rules of the district
 court[.]" HRS § 291D-13(a) (2007). Rule 19(d) of the Hawai' i 
Civil Traffic Rules (HCTR) provides that "[a]ppeals from

 Subsections (a) and (b) of HRS § 291C-161 (2007) provide:
 
§ 291C-161. Penalties. 
(a) It is a violation for any person to violate any of the
provisions of this chapter except as otherwise specified in
subsections (c) and (d) and unless the violation is by other law
of this State declared to be a felony, misdemeanor, or petty
misdemeanor.
 
(b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d),
every person who is determined to have violated any
provision of this chapter for which another penalty is not
provided shall be fined: 
(1)	 Not more than $200 for a first
 violation thereof; 
(2) 	Not more than $300 for a second
 violation committed within one year
after the date of the first 
violation; and 
(3) 	Not more than $500 for a third or
 subsequent violation committed within one
year after the date of the first
violation.
 
HRS § 291C-161(a) & (b) (2007 & Supp. 2010).

judgments entered after a trial may be taken in the manner 
provided for appeals from district court civil judgments." HCTR Rule 19(d). Appeals from district court civil judgments are authorized by HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010). 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed in
civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees
of circuit and district courts. In district court cases, a
judgment includes any order from which an appeal lies. A
 final order means an order ending the proceeding, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. When a written
 judgment, order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving
nothing further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or
decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted). 
The December 1, 2010 judgment ended the proceeding by
 
providing the final adjudication and penalty against Appellant
 for the offense of violating longitudinal traffic lane markings
 in violation of HRS § 291C-38 (2007), leaving nothing further to
 be accomplished. Therefore, the document in this case that is
 appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) is the December 1, 2010
 judgment.
 
Appellant did not file any timely post-judgment motions
 
that could have tolled the thirty-day time period for filing a
 notice of appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Appellant did
 not file his June 29, 2011 notice of appeal within thirty days
 after entry of the December 1, 2010 judgment, as HRAP Rule
 4(a)(1) requires for an appeal from a civil judgment. Therefore,
 Appellant's June 29, 2011 notice of appeal is untimely as to the
 December 1, 2010 judgment pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(1). "As a
 general rule, compliance with the requirement of the timely
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . and we must 
dismiss an appeal . . . if we lack jurisdiction." Grattafiori v. 
State, 79 Hawai' i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and original brackets omitted); Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP
 Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice thereof is authorized
 to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
 [the HRAP]."). We lack jurisdiction over this untimely appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
