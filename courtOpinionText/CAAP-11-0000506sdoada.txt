IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
REMILITO PABLO, aka Reynold Pablo, Defendant-Appellant
and
 
JESSE CERA, Defendant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-0456)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Remilito Pablo (Pablo) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on June 9, 2011 in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
 
On appeal, Pablo argues that the circuit court erred in
 
admitting over his objection the testimony of Honolulu Police
 Department (HPD) criminalist Jeanette Ardiente (Ardiente)
 regarding the weight of drug evidence she analyzed, where an
 inadequate foundation was laid for admission of evidence
 regarding the accuracy of the analytic balance she used.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 conclude Pablo's appeal is without merit.

The State laid a proper foundation for admission of 
evidence regarding the accuracy of the analytic balance Ardiente 
used. Ardiente testified that before she weighed the drug evidence, she ensured the balance was calibrated according to the manufacturer's recommendations by pressing the device's Auto Calibrate button, as she was trained to do. Ardiente "had personal knowledge that the balance had been correctly calibrated." State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai' i 382, 412, 910 P.2d 
695, 725 (1996). Cf. State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai' i 343, 355, 167 
P.3d 336, 348 (2007) (where expert who weighed drug evidence did not calibrate electronic balance himself but merely assumed manufacturer's representative properly done so, foundation for evidence as to weight of drug evidence was inadequate). Given the foregoing, circuit court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Ardiente's testimony regarding the weight of the drug evidence. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on June 9, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
