NO. CAAP-11-0000511
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI

STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TAMARA SHINE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 2DTC-10-010284)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over this appeal by Defendant-Appellant Tamara J.
 
Shine (Appellant),  pro se,  in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000511 from the
 
Honorable Blaine Kobayashi's two February 23, 2011 judgments of
 conviction in 2DTC-10-010284 for operating a motor vehicle
 without liability insurance in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 431:10C-104 (2005) and driving a motor vehicle
 without a valid license in violation of HRS § 286-102 (2007 &
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Supp. 2010), because Appellant's June 30, 2011 notice of appeal 
in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000511 is untimely under Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
An appellate court has an independent obligation to 
ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua sponte if a jurisdictional defect exits. State v. Graybeard, 
93 Hawai' i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). "Appeals from 
the district court, in criminal cases, are authorized by HRS § 641-12, which . . . provides in pertinent part that appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The two February 23, 2011 judgments of conviction are appealable judgments from a criminal case pursuant to HRS § 641-12. 
Appellant already asserted a timely appeal from the two
 
February 23, 2011 judgments in appellate court case number CAAP­11-0000117. However, on July 19, 2011, we dismissed Appellant's
 appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000117 pursuant to HRAP Rule 30
 because Appellant failed to file an opening brief in Appeal No.
 CAAP-11-0000117.
 
Appellant has attempted to assert multiple appeals from
 
the same two February 23, 2011 judgments by subsequently filing a
 June 30, 2011 notice of appeal from the same two February 23,
 2011 judgments in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000511. However, Appellant
 did not file her June 30, 2011 notice of appeal within thirty
 days after entry of the February 23, 2011 judgment, as HRAP Rule
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
4(b)(1) requires for a timely appeal. "As a general rule, 
compliance with the requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . and we must dismiss an appeal . . . if we lack jurisdiction." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai' i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (citations, internal quotation marks, and original brackets omitted). "In criminal cases, [the supreme court] ha[s] made exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be timely filed." State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai' i 
404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998). The "recognized exceptions involve circumstances where: (1) defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant’s appeal from a criminal conviction in the first instance[,] . . . or (2) the trial court’s decision was unannounced and no notice of the entry of judgment was ever provided[.]" Id. (citations omitted). 
Neither of these exceptions apply to Appellant because (1) Appellant is a pro se litigant who knowingly waived her right
 to counsel in this case, and, thus, the untimeliness of
 Appellant's June 30, 2011 notice of appeal was not the result the
 ineffective assistance of any counsel, and (2) Appellant
 obviously had timely notice of the two February 23, 2011
 judgments because Appellant already asserted a timely appeal from
 the two February 23, 2011 judgments in Appeal No. CAAP-11­0000117, which we dismissed. Therefore, under the circumstances
 of this case, we lack jurisdiction over Appellant's untimely
 appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000511. Accordingly,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal in Appeal No. 
CAAP-11-0000511 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
