NO. CAAP-11-0000512
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
PATRICK LOPEZ, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1613)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Patrick Lopez (Lopez) appeals from
 
the "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for Issuance of Writ of
 
Execution/Mandamus, Filed On January 14, 2011" (Order Denying)
 
entered June 15, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). Lopez contends the circuit court erred in
 giving the lien recorded by the Child Support Enforcement Agency
 
(CSEA) for child support arrearage priority over the attorney's
 
lien established for payment of fees.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 20, 1997, the Office of Child Support
 
Hearings of the Department of Attorney General filed an
 
administrative order finding Lopez delinquent on child support
 
with $17,964 due in arrearage. The administrative order was

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
filed in the Bureau of Conveyances on September 15, 1997 and
 
created a statutory lien for the child support arrearage.2
 
On June 30, 2008, Lopez entered into an agreement with 
an attorney for legal representation in a separate civil action 
and on September 9, 2010, received an arbitration award of $9000 
against the State of Hawai' i (State). On January 14, 2011, Lopez 
filed a "Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution/Mandamus" seeking full payment of the arbitration award from the State to 
satisfy the attorney's lien. CSEA opposed Lopez's motion. On 
June 15, 2011, the circuit court entered the Order Denying. 
Lopez filed a timely notice of appeal on July 1, 2011. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Statutory Interpretation
 
The standard of review for statutory construction is
well-established. The interpretation of a statute is
a question of law which [the appellate] court reviews
de novo. Where the language of the statute is plain
and unambiguous, our only duty is to give effect to
its plain and obvious meaning.

III. DISCUSSION
 
Lopez contends the circuit court erred in concluding
 
CSEA's statutory lien has priority over Lopez's attorney's fees
 
lien. This appeal centers on the circuit court's interpretation
 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 576D-10.5 (Supp. 1997)
 
governing child support liens and HRS § 507-81 (2006 Repl.)
 
2
 The statutory lien was created pursuant to HRS § 576D-10.5(a) (Supp.
1997), which provides in relevant part: 
§576-10.5 Liens.  (a) Whenever any obligor through judicial or
administrative process in this State or any other state has been ordered
to pay an allowance for the support, maintenance, or education of a
child, . . . and the obligor becomes delinquent in those payments, a
lien shall arise on the obligor's real and personal property . . . . No
 judicial notice or hearing shall be necessary prior to creation of such
a lien.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
governing attorney's liens. Lopez asserts the circuit court
 
failed to consider HRS § 576D-10.5 and HRS § 507-81 in pari
 
materia in light of the ambiguous language in HRS § 576D-10.5,
 
and in failing to do so, improperly concluded that the child
 
support lien took priority over the attorney's lien.
 
The language in HRS § 576D-10.5 governing child support 
liens is not ambiguous, but clearly articulates the priority of 
child support liens over subsequent liens, other than tax liens. 
"The fundamental starting point for statutory interpretation is 
the language of the statute itself." State v. Kikuta, 125 
Hawai'i 78, 88, 253 P.3d 639, 649 (2011) (brackets omitted) 
(quoting Kepoo v. Kane, 106 Hawai' i 270, 285, 103 P.3d 939, 954 
(2005)). HRS § 576D-10.5 provides in relevant part: 
. . . .
 
(c) The child support order or judgment filed through
judicial or administrative proceedings in this State or any
other state shall be recorded in the bureau of
 conveyances . . . . The lien shall become effective
 immediately upon recordation of the child support order and
shall attach to all interests in real or personal property
then owned or subsequently acquired by the obligor including
any interests not recorded with the bureau of conveyances or
filed in the land court.
 
. . . .
 
(e) Any lien provided for by this section shall take
priority over any lien subsequently acquired or recorded
except tax liens.
 
  
HRS § 576D-10.5. 
CSEA recorded the child support lien September 15,
 
1997, more than ten years before the attorney's lien. 
The plain
 
language of HRS § 576D-10.5 gives priority to CSEA's lien over
 
the subsequent attorney's lien. 
HRS § 576D-10.5 granting priority to the preceding
 
child support lien over the subsequent attorney's lien, is not
 
inconsistent with the statute governing attorney's fees,
 
HRS § 507-81(c), which provides "[e]xcept for tax liens, prior
 
liens of record on the real and personal property subject to the
 
lien created by this section, and as provided in section (d), the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
attorney's lien is superior to all other liens."3 The plain
 
language of HRS § 507-81(c) gives priority to a prior recorded
 
lien, as in this case, over a subsequent attorney's lien. 
Though Lopez contends HRS § 507-81 creates a property
 
interest for the attorney separate from that of the client,
 
HRS § 507-81(k) provides "[a]ttorneys have the same right and
 
power over actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, decrees,
 
orders, settlements, and awards to enforce their liens as the
 
clients have for the amount due thereon to them." HRS § 507-81
 
does not provide a superior or separate right for an attorney,
 
but grants the attorney the same right to the judgment as the
 
client.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for Issuance of
 
Writ of Execution/Mandamus" entered June 15, 2011 in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
