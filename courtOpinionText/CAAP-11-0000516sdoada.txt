IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
MARK SUTTON THORNE, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JACQUELYN JO THORNE, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(KONA DIVISION)
(FC-D NO. 10-1-0185K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jacquelyn Jo Thorne (Wife) appeals
 
from the "Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child
 
Custody" (Divorce Decree) filed by the Family Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit (Family Court)  on May 31, 2011.  The Divorce Decree was
 
based on "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" filed on May
 31, 2011, by the Family Court after the conclusion of the divorce
 trial of Wife and Plaintiff-Appellee Mark Sutton Thorne
 (Husband). On appeal, Wife argues that the Family Court erred
 in: (1) denying her request for alimony; and (2) including
 indemnity and bankruptcy provisions in the Divorce Decree. We
 affirm.

I. 
We resolve the arguments Wife raises on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. Wife argues that the Family Court erred in denying
 
her request for alimony. The Divorce Decree provides that
 
"[n]either party shall be required to provide support or
 maintenance for the other party." Wife challenges the Family
 Court's Conclusion of Law No. 2, which states:
 
2 . 
Based on the Findings of Fact that [Wife]
obtained two degrees, one in accounting and one in finance,
and that she has been employed for a period of time, the
Court also finds that in this case that [Wife] has not met
her burden of showing why and as to what amounts she needs.
Although she references such in her Income and Expense
Statement, which is [Wife's] Exhibit "A", the Court finds in
this case that there's testimony that the oldest child, who
is 27 years old, still resides in the residence in which
[Wife] has been occupying with the two children, but he does
not pay rent. So that tells the Court that [Wife] has not
shown why she needs money from [Husband] in this case for
alimony, so the request for alimony is denied. 
The Family Court has broad discretionary authority to 
determine alimony pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 580-47(a) 
(2006), and absent a manifest abuse of such discretion, we generally will not disturb the Family Court's decision. See 
Gussin v. Gussin, 73 Haw. 470, 478-82, 836 P.2d 484, 489-90 (1992); Jaylo v. Jaylo, 125 Hawai' i 369, 373, 262 P.3d 245, 249 
(2011). The record reflects that in denying Wife's request for alimony, the Family Court considered the factors set forth in HRS ยง 580-47(a). We cannot say that the Family Court abused its discretion in denying Wife's request for alimony. 
2. Wife argues that the Family Court erred in
 
including indemnity and bankruptcy provisions in the Divorce
 Decree. The indemnity provision requires each party responsible
 for paying a debt pursuant to the Divorce Decree to indemnify the
 other party for any liability arising from the non-payment of the
 debt. The bankruptcy provision authorizes a party to enforce the
 benefits conferred under the Divorce Decree in the event the
 other party files for bankruptcy.

Wife acknowledges that this court has previously 
indicated its support for similar provisions in Bienvenue v. 
Bienvenue, 102 Hawai' i 59, 69, 71-72, 72 P.3d 531, 541, 543-44 
(App. 2003). In addition, Wife cites no case authority to support her claim that the Family Court erred in including the indemnity and bankruptcy provisions in the Divorce Decree. We conclude that Wife has failed to demonstrate that the Family Court erred in including the indemnity and bankruptcy provisions. See Bienvenue, 102 Hawai' i at 71-72; 72 P.3d at 543-44; see also 
Fast v. Fast, 766 N.W.2d 47, 48-49 (Minn. Ct. App. 2009); 11 U.S.C. ยง 523(a)(5) & (15).
 
II.
 
We affirm the Divorce Decree filed by the Family Court.
