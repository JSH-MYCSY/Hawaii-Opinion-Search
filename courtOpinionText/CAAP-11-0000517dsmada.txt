NO. CAAP-11-0000517
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
In the Matter of the 
ELLEN K. KALAHELE REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(TRUST NO. 10-1-0141)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Respondent-Appellant Thalia K. White-Ching's
 
(Appellant White-Ching) appeal from the Honorable Derrick H.M.
 Chan's June 1, 2011 "Judgment on Order Granting Petition of Brian
 M.C. Pang for Appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem, Determination of Successor Trustee and for Vesting Order for the Ellen K. Kalahele Revocable Living Trust" (hereinafter the June 1, 2011 judgment), because the June 1, 2011 judgment is not appealable pursuant to under Rule 34 of the Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR) and 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments,
 
orders, or decrees. 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in
 
the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of HPR Rule 34 provide the
 manner by which appeals shall be taken:
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see,
 e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the
 timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with
 the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Michie's Hawaii Revised Statues
 
Annotated Court Rules, HPR Rule 34 cmt. (Michie 2010). 
Therefore, HPR Rule 34 requires conformity with the holding in
 Jenkins that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the
 orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been
 entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant
 to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as
 premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary 
for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphases 
added). Therefore, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 21, 122 
P.3d 809, 816 (2005) (citation omitted). "[A] party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994) (emphasis 
added). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339. 
The June 1, 2011 judgment does not qualify as an
 
appealable judgment under subsections (a), (b) or (c) of HPR
 Rule 34. More specifically, although the June 1, 2011 judgment
 resolves a petition by entering judgment on the April 18, 2011
 "Order Granting Petition of Brian M.C. Pang for Appointment of a
 Guardian Ad Litem, Determination of Successor Trustee and for
 Vesting Order for the Ellen K. Kalahele Revocable Living Trust"
 (the April 18, 2011 order), the June 1, 2011 judgment does not
 finally end and close the entire trust proceeding in T. No. 10-1­0141 pursuant to HPR Rule 34(c). Consequently, the June 1, 2011
 judgment is appealable under HPR Rule 34(a) only if the probate
 court certifies the June 1, 2011 judgment in the manner provided
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
by HRCP Rule 54(b). Although the April 18, 2011 order contains 
HRCP Rule 54(b) certification language, "a party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i at 93, 881 P.2d at 1239 (emphasis added). 
The June 1, 2011 judgment does not contain the necessary HRCP Rule 54(b) certification language (i.e., that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for the entry of judgment), as HPR Rule 34(a) requires for a judgment that does not finally end and close a trust proceeding. Therefore, June 1, 2011 judgment is not eligible for appellate review pursuant to HPR Rule 34 and HRS § 641-1. Absent an appealable judgment, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000517. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
