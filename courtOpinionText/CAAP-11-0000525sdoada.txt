APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this foreclosure case, Defendant-Appellant Roger P.

Chadwick ("Chadwick") appeals  from the June 30, 2011 Judgment
re: Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Claims and All
 
1
 The initial document filed in this appeal is entitled "Notice of
Defendant Roger P. Chadwick's Petition for Judicial Review (In the Nature of
an Appeal)." A "Request For Stay of the Proceedings Pending Review" is
attached to the initial document. Chadwick presents no basis for any
distinction between his appeal and a normal appeal; therefore, we treat this
initial document as a notice of appeal.
 
We also note that Chadwick's opening brief cites to Hawaii Revised
Statutes ("HRS") § 91-14(f) and (g) as a basis for judicial review. HRS § 91­14, however, does not apply in this case because it provides for judicial
review of "a final decision and order in a contested case" in the context of
 
administrative proceedings, not judicial proceedings. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 91­
14(a) (2012); see also H AW. REV. STAT. § 91-1(1), (5) (2012).

Hawaiian Bank filed its motion for summary judgment as to all
 claims and all parties, interlocutory decree of foreclosure and
 order of sale on May 10, 2011.

 Chadwick argues that (1) As best as we can understand,
genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the Circuit Court had subject matter jurisdiction "to adjudicate [Chadwick] as a private contract law violator contrary to" the Statute of Frauds, Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 17, and 12

; (2) the Circuit Court failed to adjudge
 U.S.C. § 1813 Chadwick's "timely initiated government's affirmative defense"
 raised pursuant to HRCP Rule 17; (3) the Statute of Frauds and
 HRCP Rule 17 "do not permit the lower court to proceed with any
 inappropriate action without first witnessing the ratification";
 (4) the Circuit Court's "points of error in departing from its duties caused unconstitutional acts"; and (5) "agents of the lower court have effected a fraudulent conversion of [Chadwick's] Property . . . [and] subsequent inappropriate processing . . . [is] a joinder barred by" the Statute of Frauds, HRCP Rule 17, and the U.S. and Hawai
'i constitutions. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 conclude that this appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the June 30, 2011 Judgment
 
re: Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Claims and All
 Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale

 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffeto presided.

 The opening brief is largely incomprehensible.

 12 U.S.C. § 1813 is simply a list of definitions applicable to a
portion of the United States Code dealing with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. The statute is not relevant in this case.
