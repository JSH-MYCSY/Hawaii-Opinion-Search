STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRIAN STONE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTA-10-06603)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Brian Stone (Stone) appeals from
 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
 
entered on June 14, 2011 by the District Court of the First
 
Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).1 Stone was charged
 
by complaint with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§§ 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2011).

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provide as follows:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;

arraignment similarly charged him with violating HRS §§ 291E­
61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3).3 The district court convicted Stone as
 
charged.
 
On appeal, Stone contends that the district court erred
 
in denying his oral motion to dismiss the case because the charge
 was insufficient for failing to allege that he committed the
 
OVUII offense intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. He
 
further contends that because his motion to dismiss was
 
improperly denied, the district court erred in convicting him.
 
In State v. Nesmith, ___ Haw. ___, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court recently held that: (1) mens rea must 
be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause 
of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not be alleged (or 
proven) in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), 
because the legislative intent to impose absolute liability for 
an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. Nesmith ___ Haw.

 Stone's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(3), which requires appellants to present"[a] concise statement of the case . . . and the facts material toconsideration of the questions and points presented[.]" Stone omits from his quotation of the oral charge the allegation that he violated HRS §§ 291E­61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3), and represents that it only alleged he violated HRS §291E-61(a)(1). Stone's counsel is warned that, pursuant to HRAP Rule 51,future non-compliance with HRAP Rule 28(b)(3) may result in sanctions.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that
 
mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge
 
because Stone's § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing
 
to allege mens rea.
 
The district court, however, adjudged Stone guilty of
 
violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). Subsections
 
(a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as a basis for conviction under
 
§ 291E-61. Nesmith, ___ Haw. ___, 276 P.3d at 630. Given that
 
the § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, and Stone does not
 challenge his conviction on any other basis, the error as to §
 
291E-61(a)(1) was harmless.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the District Court of the
 
First Circuit's Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 Plea/Judgment entered on June 14, 2011 is affirmed.
