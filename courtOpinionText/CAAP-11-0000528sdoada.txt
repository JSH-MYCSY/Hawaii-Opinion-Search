TYLOR TRAN, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-00241)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Tylor Tran (Tran) appeals from the
 
judgment of conviction (Judgment) filed on June 30, 2011, in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Tran was
 
charged by complaint with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence
 of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) §§ 291E–61(a)(1) and/or 291E-61(a)(4) (Supp. 2011).

 HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and 291E-61(a)(4) provide: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount

Prior to trial, Tran orally moved to dismiss the OVUII charge for
 
failure to allege a mens rea. The District Court denied the
 motion. After a bench trial, the District Court found Tran
 guilty of OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), but it
 dismissed the HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) violation because no evidence
 was presented on the (a)(4) violation.
 
On appeal, Tran argues the District Court erred in: (1)
 
denying his motion to dismiss because the OVUII charge was
 deficient for failing to allege a mens rea; (2) denying his
 motion to suppress evidence obtained after the traffic stop; (3)
 denying Tran's request for the expedited preparation of the
 transcript of the arresting police officer's testimony and
 denying Tran's alternative request for a continuance so that the
 transcript could be prepared; and (4) denying Tran's request to
 strike the arresting police officer's testimony. 
In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 53, 61, 276 P.3d 
617, 622, 630 (2012), the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that a mens 
rea must be alleged in an OVUII charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation. Pursuant to Nesmith, we conclude that Tran's HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing to allege a mens rea. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court's Judgment
 
is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court with
 instructions to dismiss the complaint without prejudice. In

not address the other points of error he raises on appeal.
