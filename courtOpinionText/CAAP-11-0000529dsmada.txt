APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0094)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff/Counterclaim-
Defendant/Appellant Narciso H. Yu, Jr. (Appellant Yu), has
 asserted from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's June 2, 2011
 "Order Granting Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Summary Judgment Filed April 4, 2011" (the June 2, 2011 
interlocutory order), because the June 2, 2011 interlocutory order is not independently appealable, and, furthermore, even if the June 2, 2011 interlocutory order were independently appealable, Appellant Yu's appeal would be untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has promulgated Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. The separate judgment must 
"either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment 
in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339 (footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
separate  judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu , 109 
Hawai'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; 
emphasis added). For example, the supreme court has explained 
that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 
171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) (emphases added). 
The June 2, 2011 interlocutory order is not a judgment,
 
nor has the circuit court reduced the June 2, 2011 interlocutory
 order to a separate judgment that is appealable, as HRCP Rule 58
 requires under the holding in. Absent an appealable final
 judgment, we lack jurisdiction over appellate court case number
 CAAP-11-0000529.
 
Even assuming, arguendo, that the June 2, 2011
 
interlocutory order was an independently appealable order,
 Appellant Yu did not file his July 7, 2011 notice of appeal
 within thirty days after entry of the June 2, 2011 interlocutory
 order, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires for a timely appeal. The
 failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice
 thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000529 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
