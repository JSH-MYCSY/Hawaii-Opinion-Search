IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
MARIANNE L. CODIAMAT, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CR. CASE NO. 1P311-173)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard and Ginoza, JJ. with
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai' i (State) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on 
June 15, 2011 in the District Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa 
Division (District Court).1 
On January 24, 2011, the State charged Defendant-
Appellee Marianne L. Codiamat (Codiamat) with Harassment, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(a)
 
(Supp. 2011). On June 15, 2011, prior to trial, Codiamat orally
 
moved to dismiss the complaint as defective based on State v.
 
McCarthy, No. 29701, 2010 WL 3433722 (App. Aug. 31, 2010) (mem.). 
On the same date, the District Court granted the motion and
 
dismissed the case without prejudice. On June 29, 2011, the

 The Honorable Clarence Pacarro presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State moved for reconsideration. On July 6, 2011, following a
 
hearing, the District Court denied the State's Motion for
 
Reconsideration. 
On appeal, the State contends that the District Court
 
erred in dismissing the complaint, because McCarthy does not
 
apply.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the State's point of error as follows:
 
The complaint against Codiamat stated:
 
On or about the 6th day of January, 2011, in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, MARIANNE L.
CODIAMAT, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm Richard
Buchanan, did strike, shove, kick, or otherwise touch
Richard Buchanan in an offensive manner or subject Richard
Buchanan to offensive physical contact, thereby committing
the offense of Harassment, in violation of Section 711­1106(1)(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
Because the charge was pleaded in the disjunctive, it did not
 
sufficiently apprise Codiamat of what she must be prepared to
 
meet. See State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 283 n.4, 567 P.2d
 
1242, 1245 n.4 (1977). 
The State contends that charging Codiamat in the
 
disjunctive was permissible because the terms strike, shove,
 kick, and otherwise touching are "factually synonymous" with an
 
offensive touching, and that "touch[ing] a person in an offensive
 
manner" and "subject[ing] the other person to offensive physical
 
contact" are simply alternative means of enacting the same
 
intent.
 
HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) states:
 
§711-1106 Harassment.  (1) A person commits the
offense of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or
alarm any other person, that person:
 
(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or subjects the other
person to offensive physical contact[.]

In State v. Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai' i 290, 22 P.3d 86 
(App. 2001), the defendant claimed that knocking off a person's
 
hat did not constitute "touching another person in an offensive
 
manner or subjecting the other person to offensive physical
 
contact." 95 Hawai' i at 294, 22 P.3d at 90 (brackets omitted). 
In Pesentheiner, this court stated:
 
The statute thus expressly proscribes contact with an
individual's person by way of a "[s]trike[], shove[],
kick[]," or other method of "touch[ing][.]" However, HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a) also prohibits, in the disjunctive and
alternatively, acts which "subject[] [another] person to
offensive physical contact[.]"
 
On appeal, the State contends that Pesentheiner's
conduct falls within the first of these prohibitions. We
 question this parsing of the statute. On its face, HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a) strains to support a construction that
defines the phrase "[s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise
touches another person" as anything less than actual bodily
contact, whether directly or indirectly through the clothing
or other material intended to cover the body. Such a
 construction would be contrary to the commonsense
understanding imparted by the statute's choice of words.
 
That said, we move to examine whether Pesentheiner
nonetheless violated the alternative prohibition of HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a), against "offensive physical contact[.]"
Pesentheiner argues that "offensive physical contact" should
be strictly construed to mean only actual contact with or
touching of another individual's person. However, as stated
above, the plain language of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) makes
clear that the statute already proscribes such actions in
its first prohibition against "[s]trik[ing], shov[ing],
kick[ing], or otherwise touch[ing] another person[.]"
 
As a general rule, "[c]ourts are bound to give effect
to all parts of a statute, and . . . no clause, sentence, or
word shall be construed as superfluous, void, or
insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found
which will give force to and preserve all words of the
statute." In re Doe, 90 Hawai' i 246, 250, 978 P.2d 684, 688
(1999). In light of this consideration, it becomes apparent
that "offensive physical contact" must constitute more than
simply the "touch[ing] [of] another person in an offensive
manner" if the phrase in the disjunctive is to hold any
independent meaning or effect.
 
We believe that "offensive physical contact"
encompasses the conduct in question here, offensive contact
that, while separate and apart from the various forms of
actual bodily touching, nevertheless involves contact with
an item physically appurtenant to the body. We believe that
 such a construction is mandated by the plain meaning of HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a), read in its entirety.

Id. at 294-95, 22 P.3d at 90-91 (emphasis added and footnotes
 
omitted).
 
Because "subject[ing] the other person to offensive
 
physical contact" has an independent and separate meaning from
 
"touches another person in an offensive manner," the terms are
 
not synonymous. 
In Jendrusch, the Hawai' i Supreme Court noted that 
proscribed conduct in one subsection of a statute was not 
factually synonymous with the proscribed conduct in another 
subsection. The court thus stated: 
In charging the defendant in the disjunctive rather than in
the conjunctive, it left the defendant uncertain as to which
of the acts charged was being relied upon as the basis for
the accusation against him. Where a statute specifies
several ways in which its violation may occur, the charge
may be laid in the conjunctive but not in the disjunctive.
 
58 Haw. at 283 n.4, 567 P.2d at 1245 n.4 (citation omitted); see
 
also McCarthy, 2010 WL 3433722 at *1.
 
Because the charge was fatally defective, the District
 
Court did not err in dismissing the case without prejudice. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order, filed on June 15, 2011 in the District 
Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division, is affirmed.
