APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Shaun L. Cabinatan (Cabinatan)
 
appeals from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" in Cr. No.
 
10-1-0904 and the "Order of Resentencing; Revocation of
 
Probation," in Cr. No. 09-1-0854, both entered on June 22, 2011
 
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
   
In Cr. No. 09-1-0854, Cabinatan pled guilty to Escape
 
in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) ยง 710-1021 (1993 Repl.). 
The circuit court entered a
 
1

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment of conviction and sentenced Cabinatan to probation for a
 
term of five years. 
In Cr. No. 10-1-0904, Cabinatan was convicted of (1)
 
Burglary in the First Degree, in violation of HRS ยง 708-810 (1993
 
Repl.) and (2) Unauthorized Entry into a Motor Vehicle in the
 
First Degree, in violation of HRS ยง 708-836.5 (Supp. 2011). 
On appeal, Cabinatan contends that: (1) the circuit
 
court abused its discretion in refusing to give a requested jury
 
instruction stating the factors to be considered in assessing the
 
accuracy of eyewitness identification, and that a cautionary jury
 
instruction regarding eyewitness identification should be
 
required in any case in which eyewitness identification is a
 
critical issue; and (2) because the revocation of probation in
 
Cr. No. 09-1-0854 was premised on Cabinatan's convictions in Cr.
 
No. 10-1-0904, the order of resentencing and revocation of
 
probation in Cr. No. 09-1-0854 must be vacated.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 
Cabinatan's points of error as follows:
 
On appeal, Cabinatan acknowledges that "the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the giving of special 
instructions on eyewitness identification is within the 
discretion of the trial judge." See State v. Vinge, 81 Hawai' i 
309, 316, 916 P.2d 1210, 1217 (1996); State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai'i 383, 404, 894 P.2d 80, 101 (1995); State v. Pahio, 58 
Haw. 323, 331-332, 568 P.2d 1200, 1206 (1977); and State v. Padilla, 57 Haw. 150, 162, 552 P.2d 357, 365 (1976). Cabinatan 
asserts, however, that the correct holding should be that "a 
cautionary jury instruction regarding eyewitness identification 
should be required in any case in which eyewitness identification 
is a critical issue." This is the same argument made by the 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant in State v. Cabagbag, 127 Hawai' i 302, 309, 277 P.3d 
1027, 1034 (2012), which was recently decided while the instant 
case was on appeal. 
In Cabagbag, the Hawai' i Supreme Court agreed with 
Cabagbag's argument when the defense requests the instruction, 
but gave its ruling prospective effect. The supreme court first 
held that "in criminal cases, the circuit courts must give the 
jury a specific eyewitness identification instruction whenever 
identification evidence is a central issue in the case, and it is 
requested by the defendant[.]" Cabagbag, 127 Hawai' i at 304, 277 
P.3d at 1029. In so holding, the supreme court abrogated Padilla, Pahio, Okumura, and Vinge, the very cases on which the 
circuit court based its decision regarding jury instructions in 
this case. 
However, the supreme court also held in Cabagbag that 
"this rule should be given prospective effect." Cabagbag, 127 
Hawai'i at 317, 277 P.3d at 1042. Specifically, the court held 
that "as to [Cabagbag] and other cases that are currently pending 
on direct appeal, this court will apply the rule then in effect 
when the cases were tried." Id. 
Cabinatan's trial in this case was held on January 26,
 
2011 and he filed his notice of appeal on July 19, 2011. The
 
supreme court decided Cabagbag on May 17, 2012. When the supreme
 
court issued its opinion in Cabagbag, briefing in this appeal had
 
not been completed and this case was "pending on direct appeal"
 
in this court. Therefore, we do not review this case under the
 
new rule decided in Cabagbag, but instead, under the rule in
 
effect at the time of Cabinatan's trial. That is, similar to the
 
analysis applied to the defendant in Cabagbag, "we must examine
 
all aspects of the trial, including the opening statements, the
 
cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, the arguments to the
 
jury, and the general instructions given by the court, to
 
determine whether the jury's attention was adequately drawn to
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the identification evidence." 127 Hawai' i at 317, 277 P.3d at 
1042 (citation omitted). Moreover, under the rule applicable 
when Cabinatan was tried, the giving of special instructions on 
identification was within the discretion of the trial court. 
Padilla, 57 Haw. at 162, 552 P.2d at 365. 
Here, the record shows that the jury's attention was
 
adequately drawn to the issue of eyewitness identification and
 
the evidence related thereto. Counsel for both parties focused
 
the jury's attention on identification from the start and made
 
the jury aware that the case turned on this issue. First, the
 
parties' opening statements alerted the jury to the fact that
 
identity was an issue. The defense counsel clearly stated that
 
he intended to present evidence to raise doubts about Cabinatan's
 
identification as the culprit. Second, direct examination of the
 
key prosecution witnesses sought to establish how they identified
 
Cabinatan as one of the culprits and defense counsel's cross-
examination of these witnesses questioned the reliability of
 
their eyewitness accounts in identifying Cabinatan. Third, the
 
parties addressed the issue of eyewitness identification during
 
closing arguments, with defense counsel enumerating several
 
reasons for the jury to consider the credibility of the witnesses
 
and the weight of their testimony as it related to the identity
 
of Cabinatan. 
Moreover, the circuit court's instructions also drew
 
the jury's attention to the identification issue and the related
 
evidence. In Jury Instruction No. 22, the circuit court
 
instructed:
 
The burden of proof is on the prosecution with
reference to every element of a crime charged, and this
burden includes the burden of proving beyond a reasonable
doubt the identity of the defendant as the person
responsible for the crimes charged.
 
(Emphasis added.) In Jury Instruction No. 11, the circuit court
 
further instructed:
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5It is your exclusive right to determine whether and to
what extent a witness should be believed and to give weight
to his or her testimony accordingly.  In evaluating the
weight and credibility of a witness' testimony, you may
consider the witness' appearance and demeanor; the witness'
manner of testifying; the witness' intelligence; the
witness' candor or frankness, or lack thereof; the witness'
interest, if any, in the result of this case; the witness'
relation, if any, to a party; the witness' temper, feeling,
or bias, if any has been shown; the witness' means and
opportunity of acquiring information; the probability or
improbability of the witness' testimony; the extent to which
the witness is supported or contradicted by other evidence;
the extent to which the witness has made contradictory
statements, whether in trial or at other times; and all
other circumstances surrounding the witness and bearing upon
his or her credibility.
Inconsistencies or discrepancies in the testimony of a
witness, or between the testimony of different witnesses,
may or may not cause you to discredit such testimony.  In
weighing the effect of inconsistencies or discrepancies,
whether they occur within one witness' testimony or as
between different witnesses, consider whether they concern
matters of importance or only matters of unimportant detail,
and whether they result from innocent error or deliberate
falsehood.
Jury Instruction No. 22 in this case follows the
instruction considered in  Vinge.  81 Hawai# i at 317, 916 P.2d at
1218.  Given such an instruction, as well as the cross-
examination and arguments of defense counsel regarding the
identification issue, the supreme court held in Vinge that the
jury's attention was adequately drawn to the issue of
identification.  Id.
The more general instructions on witness credibility in
Jury Instruction No. 11 are similar to the instructions given in
Cabagbag.   In Cabagbag,  given the opening and closing statements
of counsel, the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, and
the general instructions given by the trial court, the supreme
court held that, under the rule existing when Cabagbag was tried,
the jury's attention was adequately drawn to the identification
issue.  127 Hawai #i at 317-18, 277 P.3d 1042-43; see also
Okumura, 78 Hawai# i at 405, 894 P.2d at 102.
In this case, the opening and closing statements of
counsel, the direct examination and cross-examination of theNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
prosecution eyewitnesses, and the jury instructions given by the
 
circuit court drew adequate attention to the identification issue
 
and the related evidence. Under these circumstances and the rule
 
applicable at the time Cabinatan was tried, the circuit court was
 
not required to give a more specific instruction. Padilla, 57
 
Haw. at 161-62, 552 P.2d at 364-65. We thus conclude that the
 circuit court did not abuse its discretion in not giving a more
 
specific jury instruction on eyewitness identification in Cr. No.
 
10-1-0904.
 
Given our ruling with regard to Cabinatan's conviction
 
in Cr. No. 10-1-0904, the circuit court did not err in revoking
 
Cabinatan's probation in Cr. No. 09-1-0854.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we affirm the "Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence" in Cr. No. 10-1-0904 and the "Order of
 Resentencing; Revocation of Probation" in Cr. No. 09-1-0854, both
 
entered on June 22, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit.
