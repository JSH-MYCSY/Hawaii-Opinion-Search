On January 6, 2003, Willis signed a written Guilty Plea
 
and pled guilty to the 11 charges in the Amended Complaint. On
 
March 10, 2003, a Judgment was entered which found Willis guilty
 
and sentenced him to a 5-year term of probation. On
 
September 20, 2007, an Order of Resentencing/Revocation of
 
Probation was issued, Willis's probation was revoked, and Willis
 
was resentenced to 5 years imprisonment for Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
 
and 6 (concurrently to each other), 10 years imprisonment for
 
Count 8 and 5 years imprisonment for Count 9 (concurrent with
 
Counts 1 to 6), and 5 years imprisonment for Count 7 (consecutive
 
to Counts 1 to 6, 8, and 9).
 
On September 23, 2010, Willis filed a Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 
from Custody (Petition) which stated two grounds for relief; (1)
 
that he did not plead guilty to the charges and (2) that he
 
received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel
 
failed to raise the issue of his failure to plead guilty to the
 
charges.

On December 27, 2010, Willis filed a Supplement to 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 Petition which stated 
additional claims and arguments for relief. Willis claimed that 
his plea was not an understanding and knowing plea because in 
exchange for his plea, "his offenses would be consolidated into 
an amended complaint that would then make [Willis] eligible for 
probation. [Willis] also understood that should probation ever 
be revoked, the amended complaint adjudicating all offenses at 
one time would eliminate the possibility of consecutive 
sentences. Thus, [Willis] believed that he would only be subject 
to a maximum ten year term of incarceration." Willis further 
claimed that the State breached the terms of the plea agreement 
by obtaining sentences that were consecutive. Willis contended 
that by consolidating the charges into an amended complaint, he 
would not be considered a repeat offender and the court could not 
impose consecutive sentences. 
On July 6, 2011, the circuit court issued an order
 
denying the Petition.
 
On appeal, Willis contends that the circuit court erred
 
by denying his Petition because (1) at his change of plea hearing
 
he was misled about the ramifications of his guilty plea and,
 
therefore, he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into his
 
guilty plea and (2) there was no lawful basis to impose a five
 
year term of imprisonment consecutive to a ten year term of
 
imprisonment.
 
Specifically, Willis claims that based upon his
 
colloquy with the court and agreement with the State to
 
consolidate eleven charges against him that "there would be no
 
basis whatsoever for the Court to then select some other option
 
by imposing a prison sentence which involved more than one of the
 
charges." Willis also argues that according to his agreement
 
with the State, he would be eligible for probation and that he
 
would not be deemed a repeat offender, therefore, his consecutive
 
sentence was improper.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Willis's points of error as follows:
 
In his points of error on appeal, Willis provided no
 
citation to (1) where the alleged error occurred in either the
 
S.P.P. proceeding or his underlying case or (2) where the alleged 
error was objected to or the manner in which it was brought to 
the attention of the court in the S.P.P. proceeding. Therefore, 
Willis's claims on appeal are waived. Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(ii) and (iii). Even if Willis's points of error on appeal are not waived, they are without merit. 
The record reflects that Willis approved of two cases
 
being consolidated and two additional misdemeanor charges being
 
added to an Amended Complaint. The record further shows that
 
Willis was informed that the maximum sentence for all eleven
 
charges was 52 years imprisonment if all sentences were imposed
 
consecutively, not including extended terms. The record also
 
demonstrates that Willis was advised that the circuit court was
 
not bound by any agreement between him and the State when
 
imposing a sentence. Therefore, Willis's claim that he could
 
only be sentenced for one charge is without merit.
 
Willis's second point of error on appeal that he would
 
be eligible for probation and would not be deemed a repeat
 
offender is also without merit. The record reflects that Willis
 
was initially sentenced to probation. Willis's probation was
 
revoked and he was resentenced to consecutive sentences allowed
 
under HRS § 706-668.5 (1993). Therefore, Willis's consecutive
 
sentence was not imposed as a result of his plea agreement with
 
the State nor being deemed a repeat offender under HRS § 706­
606.5
 (Supp. 2005).
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the July 6, 2011 Order
 
Denying Petitioner's Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
