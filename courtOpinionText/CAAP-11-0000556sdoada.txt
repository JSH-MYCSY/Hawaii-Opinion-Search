DAVID PANOKE, Claimant-Appellant, v.
REEF DEVELOPMENT and SEABRIGHT INSURANCE,
Employer/Insurance Carrier-Appellee,
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2005-243 (NO. 2-04-07185))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant David Panoke (Panoke) appeals from a
 
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) June 14,
 
2011 Decision and Order that affirms in part, reverses in part,
 
and modifies in part the Director of Labor and Industrial
 Relations' (the Director) decisions regarding Panoke's claim for
 
workers' compensation benefits from Employer-Appellee Reef
 
Development of Hawaii, Inc. (Reef Development) and Insurance
 
Carrier-Appellee Seabright Insurance Company (Seabright
 Insurance).
 
Panoke raises several points of error on appeal,
 
arguing that the LIRAB erred:
 
(1) in its Finding of Fact (FOF) that the work
 
accident did not aggravate or accelerate Panoke's bilateral
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
shoulder conditions, that Panoke would have experienced immediate
 
symptoms, that Panoke's argument that the shoulder symptoms were
 masked by his low back injury is inconsistent with the report of
 knee symptoms, and that Panoke's shoulder conditions are
 inconsistent with a traction type mechanism of injury;
 
(2) as a matter of law in Conclusion of Law (COL) 1
 
that Panoke did not sustain injuries to his shoulders at work and
 that Reef Development rebutted the presumption of compensability;
 
(3) as a matter of law in COL 1 by refusing to
 
consider any argument that Panoke's injury involved cumulative
 trauma; 
(4) as a matter of law in COL 2 by limiting temporary
 
total disability (TTD) to 6/20/2004 – 6/22/2004, 6/30/2004 –
 
12/17/2005, and 4/11/2006 – 5/11/2006; 
(5) as a matter of law in COL 2 by requiring that
 
certifications of disability be contemporaneous, in writing,
 
include the date of the accident, and that they mention the
 condition for which the disability is certified; similarly, the
 LIRAB further erred in holding that descriptions such as "off
 work" or that a claimant is "significantly impaired" are
 insufficient as a certification of disability without a statement
 that such impairment or disability is due to the work injury;
 
(6) in COL 2 by holding that the record did not
 
include statements of certification that Panoke was temporarily
 and totally disabled due to a work injury; 
(7) as a matter of law in COL 3 that Reef Development
 
was not liable for a late payment of TTD benefits and that there
 was no evidence that the payments were untimely; 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(8) as a matter of law in COL 3 that except for the
 
period 4/11/2006 - 5/11/2006, Claimant was not entitled to TTD
 
benefits after 12/17/2005; and
 
(9) as a matter of law in holding that Panoke was not
 
entitled to treatment with Dr. Loos for chronic pain.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve Panoke's points of error as
 follows:
 
(1 & 2) Hawai
'i workers' compensation law contains a 
strong presumption in favor of employee claims. Hawaii Revised 
1
Statutes (HRS) § 386-85 (1993),  states that for all workers'
compensation claims "it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . [t]hat the claim is for a covered work injury." This places a "heavy burden" on the employer, imposing "the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion." Van Ness v. State of Haw., Dep't 
Of Educ., 131 Hawai
'i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014) (citing 
Lawhead v. United Air Lines, 59 Haw. 551, 559, 584 P.2d 119, 124 (1978) and Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 53 Haw. 
1
 HRS § 386-85 states the following:
 
§ 386-85 Presumptions. In any proceeding for the
enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter
it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence
to the contrary:
(1)	 That the claim is for a covered work injury;
(2)	 That sufficient notice of such injury has been
given;
(3)	 That the injury was not caused by the
intoxication of the injured employee; and
(4)	 That the injury was not caused by the wilful
intention of the injured employee to injure
oneself or another.

406, 408, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972)). 
"In order to overcome the HRS § 386-85(1) presumption 
of work-relatedness, the employer must introduce substantial 
evidence to the contrary"; in other words, substantial evidence that the injury does not relate to the employment. Igawa v. Koa 
House Rest., 97 Hawai
'i 402, 407, 38 P.3d 570, 575 (2001). "The 
term substantial evidence signifies a high quantum of evidence which, at the minimum, must be relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable [person] that an injury or death is not work connected." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted). If the employer is unable to produce this "substantial evidence," then the presumption requires that the claimant prevail. Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 P.3d at 477; Akamine, 
53 Haw. at 409, 495 P.2d at 1166. If, however, the "trier of fact determines that the employer has adduced substantial evidence to overcome the presumption, it must weigh the evidence elicited by the employer against the evidence elicited by the claimant." Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i at 409, 38 P.3d at 577 (citation 
omitted). Additionally, given the "humanitarian" nature of the workers' compensation law, the supreme court has liberally construed HRS § 386-85 and "requires that all reasonable doubts be resolved in favor of the claimant." See Van Ness 131 Hawai
'i 
at 558, 319 P.3d at 447 (citations omitted). Thus, "if there is reasonable doubt as to whether an injury is work-connected, the . . . statute demands that doubt be resolved in favor of the claimant." Akamine, 53 Haw. at 409, 495 P.2d at 1166. 
As the Hawai
'i Supreme Court noted in Van Ness, when 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"determining the compensability of injuries 'by accident'" (as is 
true in the instant case, where Panoke cites to the June 2004 accident as the source of his injuries), one must use the "unitary" or "nexus" test. Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 560, 319 
P.3d at 479. This unitary test "considers whether there is a sufficient work connection to bring the accident within the scope of the statute, and requires the finding of a causal connection between the injury and any incidents or conditions of employment." Id. at 560, 319 P.3d at 479 (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). Appellate courts must also keep in mind that, when reviewing a LIRAB decision on the issue of compensability, deference should be given to the LIRAB's assessment of witness credibility and evidentiary weight. Moi v. 
State, Dep't of Pub. Safety, 118 Hawai
'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 
756 (App. 2008); see Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai 'i 263, 268, 47 
P.3d 730, 735 (2002); Igawa, 97 Hawai 'i at 409-10, 38 P.3d at 
577-78. 
Panoke asserts that the LIRAB erred in its COL 1 that 
he did not sustain injuries to his shoulders at work and that Reef Development rebutted the presumption of compensability. We start with the presumption that Panoke's claim for shoulder injuries is a covered work injury and then examine the record to determine if Reef Development was able to meet its heavy burden of providing substantial evidence to overcome the presumption. HRS § 386-85(1); Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 P.3d at 477. 
In examining the record, it appears that there was
 
sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that Panoke's
 shoulder injuries were work injuries. Three physicians (Drs.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Agles, Lau, and Diamond) each independently concluded that the
 
shoulder condition was not (or, at least, not likely) due to the
 industrial accident. The physicians gave clear and well-
articulated answers as to why Panoke's bilateral shoulder
 condition was unrelated to the work incident. For instance, Dr.
 Agles cited a litany of reasons, including the following: the
 "lack of documentation of shoulder involvement initially"; a
 "history of prior severe trauma to the shoulders requiring
 hospitalization"; Panoke's inability to explain how the right
 shoulder was injured in the accident; Panoke's subjective
 complaints being "out of proportion to the objective findings";
 and possible "drug-seeking behavior." The other physicians, Dr.
 Lau and Dr. Diamond, gave similar reasons. Additionally, Dr.
 Diamond conducted an analysis of Panoke's MRI arthrograms for his
 shoulder and concluded that the arthrograms revealed injuries of
 a longstanding, degenerative nature; he stated that he did not
 think that the shoulder conditions related to the work accident. 
Dr. Diamond found that the mechanism of Panoke's injury was not
 typical of the shoulder pathology found because a superior labrum
 injury usually involves a compressive mechanism, such as seen in
 overhead throwing, rather than a traction mechanism, as in this
 case. He also noted that, "[i]n rare cases where traction
 mechanism is implicated, [superior labrum] lesions usually
 involve a biceps avulsion, as well as other pathology, and that
 Dr. Okamura had specifically noted that Panoke's biceps tendon
 was normal. Dr. Diamond admitted that it was possible that the
 work injury accelerated the shoulder conditions (essentially that
 it was within the realm of possibilities, however remote), but
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
concluded that it was not probable. These medical opinions 
constituted a "high quantum of evidence," which was "relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable [person] that [Panoke's shoulder] injury . . . [wa]s not work connected." See Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i at 
407, 38 P.3d at 575 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
We reject Panoke's argument that these were 
"generalized opinions." See Akamine, 53 Haw. 406, 495 P.2d 1164; 
Korsak v. Hawaii Permanente Med. Grp., 94 Hawai
'i 297, 308, 12 
P.3d 1238, 1249 (2000); Nakamura, 98 Hawai 'i at 269, 47 P.3d at 
736. Despite Panoke's contentions otherwise, there was 
consideration of whether the work injury could have aggravated Panoke's pre-existing shoulder condition. Dr. Diamond testified as to this issue, replying "[n]o" to a question about whether it was probable that the "industrial accident aggravated or accelerated [Panoke's] preexisting degenerative condition." He 
based this answer, in part at least, on the "mechanism of 
injury," the fact that the shoulder symptoms did not appear until weeks after the industrial accident, and because the MRI results showed that the tears were "longstanding" in nature. Moreover, the physicians' expert opinions in the present case, as in Nakamura, "did more than opine generally that [claimant] had an illness predating his employment." See Nakamura, 98 Hawai
'i at 
269, 47 P.3d at 736. Rather, the medical reports identified specific reasons as to why the shoulder injuries were not work related and why the industrial accident did not exacerbate Panoke's pre-existing condition. 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The final step in the analysis is "weigh[ing] the 
evidence elicited by [Reef Development] against the evidence 
elicited by [Panoke]," keeping in mind that reasonable doubts should be resolved in Panoke's favor. Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i at 409, 
38 P.3d at 577 (citation omitted); see also Van Ness, 131 Hawai 'i 
at 558-59, 319 P.3d at 477-78. One piece of evidence favorable to Panoke is encompassed in a statement by Dr. McCaffrey, Panoke's attending physician, who wrote in a January 31, 2005 letter that: 
[T]here is no evidence nor reason to hypothesize a pre­
existing condition. It is noted that the patient did have a
decade old injury to his shoulders. However, he has been
involved in heavy work activities as well as recreational
pursuits and was clinically asymptomatic prior to the June
17, 2004 work-related accident.
 
Dr. Okamura also responded affirmatively to a letter asking him
 
whether the June 2004 incident caused or aggravated Panoke's
 shoulder condition, but he did not specify whether it was a
 direct cause or simply an aggravation, even though in an earlier
 WC-2 Physician's Report he marked a box indicating that the
 accident was the only cause of Panoke's condition. However,
 these statements by Drs. McCaffrey and Okamura were made before
 the MRI arthrograms were conducted on Panoke's shoulders, and
 there was evidence of a pre-existing condition, as revealed by
 Dr. Diamond's analysis of the MRI arthrograms in which he
 explained how they showed a process of long-term degeneration in
 the shoulders. There was also controversy over Dr. Okamura's
 work-relatedness opinion because that opinion was based (at least
 in part) on an July 2, 2004 pain diagram that was apparently
 altered in the shoulder region. 
In sum, considering all of the evidence presented by
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
both Reef Development and Panoke regarding work-relatedness, as
 
well as the § 386-85(1) presumption and that all reasonable
 doubts should be resolved in favor of Panoke, this court
 concludes that the LIRAB did not err in its COL 1 that Reef
 Development rebutted the presumption of compensability and that
 Panoke's shoulder injuries were not work related. Reef
 Development produced a high quantum of evidence through the
 testimony and reports of various independent physicians,
 outweighing the evidence that Panoke presented in both quantity
 and quality. Therefore, the LIRAB's COL 1 ruling regarding
 Panoke's shoulder injuries was not error as a matter of law.
 
(3) Citing Baldauf v. AOAO Regency Park, No. 28646
 
(Haw. App. June 25, 2009) (mem.), Panoke contends that the LIRAB
 erred as a matter of law in COL 1 by rejecting the argument that
 his injury involved cumulative trauma. Baldauf is
 
distinguishable. In Baldauf, this court reasoned that "a theory
 of cumulative trauma can reasonably be inferred as existing
 within Baldauf's initial claim"; however, in the present case, no
 such reasonable inference can be made. See id. Whereas Baldauf
 
stated "[f]rom the initiation of his claim" that he had knee pain
 and that the work activity had aggravated his knee condition,
 Panoke, in contrast, did not notice shoulder pain until weeks
 after the industrial accident. Id. Additionally, unlike in
 
Baldauf, Panoke never alleged that his general work activities
 caused the shoulder problems (rather, his focus was solely on the
 June 2004 accident), and the issue of cumulative trauma was not
 brought up until the trial was well underway. See id. 
Therefore, we conclude that the LIRAB did not err in this regard.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4-7) Panoke argues that the LIRAB erred in COLs 2 and
 
3 regarding the award of TTD benefits resulting from the June 17,
 
2004 work injury. First, Panoke contends that the LIRAB erred as
 a matter of law in its COL 2 by requiring that certifications of
 disability be contemporaneous, in writing, include the date of
 the accident, and that they mention the condition for which the
 disability is certified. Panoke further states that the LIRAB
 erred in holding that descriptions such as "off work" or that a
 claimant is "significantly impaired" are insufficient as a
 certification of disability without a statement that such
 impairment or disability is due to the work injury. The LIRAB
 made clear in its decision that these requirements were based
 upon the LIRAB's own interpretation of the applicable "laws and
 rules." 
2
One of these laws is HRS § 386-96 (Supp. 2013),  which,
2	 HRS § 386-96 states, in relevant part:
 
§ 386-96 Reports of physicians, surgeons, and
hospitals. (a) Any physician, surgeon, or hospital that has
given any treatment or rendered any service to an injured
employee shall make a report of the injury and treatment on
forms prescribed by and to be obtained from the department
as follows:
 
(1)	 Within seven days after the date of first
attendance or service rendered, an initial
report shall be made to the department and to
the employer of the injured employee in the
manner prescribed by the department;
(2)	 Interim reports to the same parties and in the
same manner as prescribed in paragraph (1) shall
be made at appropriate intervals to verify the
claimant's current diagnosis and prognosis, that
the information as to the nature of the
 examinations and treatments performed is
complete, including the dates of those
treatments and the results obtained within the
 current reporting period, the execution of all
tests performed within the current reporting
period and the results of the tests, whether the
injured employee is improving, worsening, or if
"medical stabilization" has been reached, the
dates of disability, any work restrictions, and
(continued...)
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
inter alia, governs the reports of physicians and requires that
 
one rendering "service to an injured employee shall make a report
 of the injury and treatment on forms prescribed by and to be
 obtained from the [Department of Labor and Industrial
 Relations]." "WC-2 Physician's Report" is one such form issued
 by the Disability Compensation Division of the Department of
 Labor and Industrial Relations (DCD), and it includes places
 
where the physician must indicate the date of the injury, where
 
and how the accident occurred, a specific description of the
 injury, causes of the claimant's condition, whether the accident
 resulted in a work disability, and whether the claimant is able
 to return to work. HRS § 386-96(a)(2) also requires that
 physicians report information regarding "the dates of disability,
 any work restrictions, and the return to work date." 
(...continued)
 
the return to work date. When an injured
employee is returned to full-time, regular,
light, part-time, or restricted work, the
attending physician shall submit a report to the
employer within seven calendar days indicating
the date of release to work or medical
 stabilization; and
(3) 
	A final report to the same parties and in the
same manner as prescribed in paragraph (1) shall
be made within seven days after termination of
treatment.
 
No physician, surgeon, or hospital that has given any
treatment or rendered any service to an injured employee
shall be required to provide any additional reports not
otherwise mandated by this section.
(b) No claim under this chapter for medical treatment,
surgical treatment, or hospital services and supplies, shall
be valid and enforceable unless the reports are made as
provided in this section, except that the director may
excuse the failure to make the report within the prescribed
period or a nonsubmission of the report when the director
finds it in the best interest of justice to do so. If the
director does not excuse the submission of:
 
(1)	 An initial or interim report within the time
prescribed in subsection (a)(1) and (2); or
(2)	 A final report that is thirty days late or a
nonsubmission,

the delinquent physician shall be fined not more than $250.

Accordingly, the foregoing reporting requirements were based upon 
statutory authority and were not error as a matter of law. See 
Igawa, 97 Hawai 'i at 406, 38 P.3d at 574. 
Nevertheless, the LIRAB's requirement that each 
certification of disability contains a specific statement that the impairment/disability is due to work injury is questionable. See HRS § 386-96. We note that the penalty for noncompliance under HRS § 386-96 is directed at physicians and takes the form of a minor, monetary fine. HRS § 386-96(b). Eligible claimants should not be denied benefits under Hawai
'i workers' compensation 
law simply because their physician failed to properly word the requisite report. See Custino v. State, No. CAAP-11-0000570 
(App. May 15, 2014) (mem.). In this case, however, as discussed below, the LIRAB did not err in its determination of the TTD benefits periods. Therefore, any error in LIRAB's articulation of the certification requirement is harmless error. 
Panoke further asserts that the LIRAB erred as a matter
 
of law in its COL 2 limiting TTD benefits to 6/20/2004 –
 6/22/2004, 6/30/2004 – 12/17/2005, and 4/11/2006 – 5/11/2006. 
Panoke argues that he is entitled to TTD benefits from 6/21/2004
 -7/12/2007, rather than the more limited TTD benefits awarded by
 
the LIRAB. He bases this contention on the clinical notes from
 Concentra Medical Center, as well as "WorkStar clinical notes
 from 6/30/2004 through 7/12/2007," which "kept [Panoke] off
 work." 
The first period that TTD benefits were awarded was the
 
period of 6/20/04 - 6/22/04. Although the work accident occurred
 on 6/17/04, the TTD was not started until 6/20/04 because of a
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
three-day waiting period that stems from HRS § 386-31(b) (Supp.
 
2013), which states that benefits do not include the "first three
 calendar days." Dr. Diaz-Ordaz, however, released Panoke to work
 "modified duty" starting on 6/19/04, and on 6/22/04, Reef
 Development notified Panoke that he was to return to work the
 next day. Thus, the LIRAB did not err in awarding Panoke
 benefits for the period of 6/20/04 - 6/22/04. 
The next TTD benefits period awarded was 6/30/04 –
 
12/17/05. The LIRAB's decision derived, in part, from the
 Director's June 13, 2005 Decision, in which the Director awarded
 TTD benefits for the periods of 6/20/2004 – 6/22/2004 and
 6/30/2004 – 4/5/2005. The benefits for this latter period
 started on 6/30/04 because that was the first time that Panoke
 visited Dr. McCaffrey, who examined Panoke and subsequently
 listed his work status as "[o]ff duty." The June 13, 2005
 Decision awarded benefits through 4/5/05 because Reef Development
 terminated TTD on 4/6/05 based on a 2/15/05 IME by Dr. Lau, in
 which he stated that Panoke's back was only temporarily
 aggravated (and had been resolved) and that Panoke's shoulder was
 not related to the work accident. 
The case was then remanded to the DCD on 6/26/06, so
 
that the Director could determine several issues, including,
 inter alia, Panoke's request to compel Reef Development to pay
 TTD and assess penalties, and whether Panoke was entitled to
 treatment with Dr. Loos. The Director issued a supplemental
 Decision on October 13, 2006, extending TTD benefits for the
 period of 4/6/05 - 9/19/06. The Director based its TTD award on
 its own "Findings of Fact and Principles of Law," the crediting
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of various interim reports by Dr. McCaffrey from 3/31/05 ­
2/13/06, and the resumed TTD payment by Reef Development after
 Panoke's right shoulder surgery on 2/3/06. The supplemental
 Decision emphasized that additional TTD, if any, was to be paid
 upon medical certification. 
The LIRAB, however, in its June 14, 2011 Decision and 
Order, then shortened the TTD period to 6/30/04 - 12/17/05, instead of through 9/19/06. The decision to shorten the period was made based on the rationale that Panoke was not entitled to TTD benefits after 12/17/05 because of the following: the "non-compensability of the bilateral shoulder condition," "Dr. Diamond's opinion that [Panoke] had achieved maximum medical improvement and stability 18 months after the industrial accident," and based on the fact that Panoke was not in a vocational rehabilitation program. Panoke argues that he "would be entitled to TTD benefits after 12/17/2005 if he had a worsening of his condition" or "if he engaged in vocational rehabilitation services." However, he did not provide any evidence that either of these situations occurred. Based on the foregoing, the LIRAB's decision to limit TTD to the period of 6/30/04 - 12/17/05 was grounded in sufficient "credible evidence" supporting the restriction; thus, the LIRAB did not clearly err in this regard. See In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 
Hawai
'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000). 
The final period that the LIRAB awarded TTD benefits
 
for was 4/11/06 – 5/11/06. In making this decision, the LIRAB
 stated that "[f]or the period April 11, 2006 through May 11,
 2006, the Board credits Dr. McCaffrey's Work Restriction Profile
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and concludes that [Panoke] was disabled due to the June 17, 2004 
work injury." Crediting Dr. McCaffrey's report was not clear error, and Panoke makes no objection to including this period for TTD. Therefore, given the reasons set forth above, as well as the deference afforded to an agency's expertise when mixed questions of law and fact are presented, we conclude that the LIRAB did not clearly err in limiting Panoke's TTD payments to the periods of 6/20/2004 – 6/22/2004, 6/30/2004 – 12/17/2005, and 4/11/2006 – 5/11/2006. See Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i at 406, 38 P.3d at 
574.
 
(8) Panoke asserts that the LIRAB erred as a matter of
 
law in its COL 3 that Reef Development was not liable for a late
 payment of TTD benefits and that there was no evidence that the
 payments were untimely. Specifically, Panoke states that the
 LIRAB erred in not penalizing Reef Development for the late
 payments of TTD benefits for the period of 4/6/2005 - 2/2/2006. 
He argues that the TTD benefits should have been paid because the
 LIRAB denied a Motion For Stay of the payments on August 5, 2005,
 and he states that "[a]s of 4/26/2006, [he] had not received TTD
 since April 2005." 
Reef Development and Seabright Insurance brought the
 
Motion For Stay Of Payments on July 8, 2005 in order to stay the
 TTD benefits awarded by the Director's Decision of June 13, 2005. 
In that Decision, the Director awarded Panoke TTD benefits for
 the periods of 6/20/2004 – 6/22/2004 and 6/30/2004 – 4/5/2005. 
It was not until October 13, 2006 that the Director issued a
 supplemental Decision on the matter, which extended TTD benefits
 to the period of 4/6/2005 - 9/19/2006. Thus, Panoke's argument
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that "[a]s of 4/26/2006, [he] had not received TTD since April
 
2005" does not entitle him to late payment penalties because TTD
 payments were not actually extended beyond April 2005 until
 October 2006. Panoke offers no evidence that Reef Development
 provided any late payments after the October 13, 2006 Decision,
 nor does he allege that the TTD benefits awarded pursuant to that
 Decision were late. Accordingly, we conclude the LIRAB did not
 err in its COL 3 that Reef Development was not liable for a
 penalty for late payment of TTD benefits and that there was no
 evidence that the payments were untimely. 
(9) Panoke contends that the LIRAB erred as a matter of 
law in denying him treatment with Dr. Loos for chronic pain. At the outset, we note the distinction between two issues related to Panoke's claim and request for pain treatment with Dr. Loos: (1) whether Panoke is claiming that the work accident caused him to develop (or exacerbated) a pain disorder or condition, such that the disorder is now a subsequent compensable claim for a "covered work injury"; and/or (2) whether Panoke is disputing the method of treatment or the right to a certain type of treatment for injuries involving a work-related accident. The former would trigger an analysis under HRS § 386-85(1); the latter would not because it is simply addressing what treatment is due. See 
Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai
'i 86, 91, 34 P.3d 
16, 21 (2001) (noting that the HRS § 386-85(1) presumption "relates solely to the work-connectedness of an injury"); Korsak, 94 Hawai
'i at 307, 12 P.3d at 1248 (stating that "in any 
proceeding on a claim for compensation due to an alleged compensable consequence of a work-related injury, HRS § 386-85 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
creates a presumption in favor of the claimant that the 
subsequent injury is causally related to the primary injury"); Davenport v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 100 Hawai
'i 297, 310, 59 
P.3d 932, 945 (App. 2001) (stating that "the exacerbation of a pre-existing [sic] condition that is the direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury would be a compensable subsequent injury" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
In the present case, Panoke is not contending that the 
June 2004 work accident caused/exacerbated a pain disorder, nor is he asserting that his chronic pain is really a "subsequent injury"; rather, he is arguing that the chronic pain treatment with Dr. Loos should be included as part of his "treatment plan" for the primary injury of June 2004. Therefore, we consider whether the LIRAB erred by not including the chronic pain treatment as a necessary facet of Panoke's treatment plan. The right to medical care for injured workers in Hawai
'i is set out 
in HRS § 386-21 (Supp. 2013), which states that "[i]mmediately after a work injury sustained by an employee and so long as reasonably needed the employer shall furnish to the employee all medical care, services, and supplies as the nature of the injury requires." HRS § 386-21(a) (emphasis added). Additionally, HRS § 386-26 (Supp. 2013) provides guidelines for administering the health care services, stating (in relevant part) the following: 
The director shall issue guidelines for the frequency
of treatment and for reasonable utilization of medical care
 
and services by health care providers that are considered
necessary and appropriate under this chapter. The guidelines
shall not be considered as an authoritative prescription for
health care, nor shall they preclude any health care
provider from drawing upon the health care provider's
medical judgment and expertise in determining the most
 
17

appropriate care.
 
Thus, the decision as to what medical treatment is
 
"appropriate care" involves an inquiry into what medical
 
treatment is "required" and "reasonably needed" given the "nature
 of the injury," and deference is afforded to the claimant's
 "health care provider" to help make that determination based on
 their "medical judgment and expertise." See HRS § 386-21(a); HRS
 
§ 386-26.
 
In examining whether the chronic pain treatment with
 
Dr. Loos was "required" and "reasonably needed" medical treatment
 given the "nature of [Panoke's] injury," we note that the
 Director, in the October 13, 2006 supplemental Decision,
 decided to deny the treatment with Dr. Loos, crediting two
 reports in making this decision: one written by Dr. Jon
 Streltzer on September 1, 2006 and one by Dr. Diamond on
 September 14, 2006. Dr. Streltzer's report was based on an
 "independent psychiatric examination" of Panoke, and in it he
 opined that Panoke had a "somatoform type of pain disorder in
 which psychological factors predominate over the physical"
 (something also recognized by Drs. Agles and Lau). Dr. Streltzer
 stated that the treatment focus should be "on function" and that
 "[m]edications that have adverse effects, excessive diagnostic
 studies, and invasive interventions are not recommended." Dr.
 Diamond's report also supported the LIRAB's decision to deny the
 treatment with Dr. Loos because it stated that Panoke's long-term
 pain management could be provided by Dr. McCaffrey, rather than a
 pain management specialist. 
We also examine the course of treatment recommended by
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the claimant's own "health care provider." See HRS § 386-26. In
 
this case, Panoke's "health care provider" is Dr. McCaffrey
 
because he is Panoke's attending physician. Dr. McCaffrey
 requested a consult with Dr. Loos for the purposes of obtaining
 an evaluation and recommendations; Reef Development authorized
 this request (as well as one follow-up visit). However, Dr.
 McCaffrey did not request ongoing treatment with Dr. Loos,
 thereby supporting the conclusion that such specialized chronic
 pain treatment was neither "require[d]" nor "reasonably needed"
 given the "nature of [Panoke's] injury." See HRS § 386-21(a). 
Therefore, we conclude that the LIRAB did not err as a matter of
 law in holding that Panoke was not entitled to ongoing treatment
 with Dr. Loos for chronic pain.
 
For these reasons, the LIRAB's June 14, 2011 Decision
 
and Order is affirmed.
