MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant/Appellant John Riddel, Jr. (Riddel) appeals
 
from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's (circuit court)1
 
"Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of
 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on First Amended Complaint,
 
Filed June 17, 2010" (Judgment), filed June 22, 2011. As part of
 
his appeal he seeks review of the circuit court's underlying
 
orders: (1) "Order Denying Defendant John Riddel, Jr.'s Motion to
 
Dismiss for Improper Venue, Filed April 7, 2011" (Order Denying
Motion to Dismiss), filed June 22, 2011 and (2) "Findings of

for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
 
Defendants on First Amended Complaint, Filed June 17, 2010"
 
(FOFs/COLs/Order), filed June 22, 2011.
 
Riddel contends the circuit court erred by:2
 
(1) hearing the case because the venue in Lihue, 
Kaua'i, was statutorily improper, relatively inconvenient, and 
all parties did not object to transfer; 
(2) failing to find numerous material facts in genuine
 
dispute as supported by expert banking testimony pertaining to
 
predatory lending, loan terms having been switched on Riddel at
 
closing, and Plaintiff-Appellee American Savings Bank, F.S.B.
 
(ASB) having conspired with Riddel's co-borrowers to fake his
 
qualifying for the loan in violation of ASB's underwriting
 guidelines; and
 
(3) entering findings of fact and conclusions of law
 
(FOFs/COLs) that were incomplete, do not address Riddel's
 
equitable and legal claims and defenses, and were untrustworthy
 because they adopt, verbatim, ASB's proposed FOFs/COLs.
I. BACKGROUND
 
By Conditional Loan Approval Letter dated April 10,
 
2006, ASB loaned Riddel $432,000. The terms provided for
 repayment in 36 months, a floating interest rate, a floating
 
estimated annual percentage rate, and floating lock expiration.
 
The repayment terms specified monthly payments of $2,384.99
 for
 
the first 35 months, and a final balloon payment in the amount of
 
$434,384.98.

An unsigned Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement dated
 
May 8, 2006 identified Riddel as the borrower, ASB as the lender,
 
$430,039.37 as the amount of credit extended to Riddel, and
 
$460,619.88 as the amount Riddel would have paid after eleven
 
monthly payments of $2,384.99 (beginning July 1, 2006) and one
 
payment of $434,384.99 due on June 1, 2007.
 
An unsigned Settlement Statement dated May 12, 2006
 
reflects the Paiks as the borrowers, ASB as the lender of
 
$432,000, and the sale/purchase price of the Property as
 
$540,000.
 
A notarized, signed, mortgage instrument dated May 29,
 
2007 (Mortgage) names the Paiks and Riddel as "borrower" of
 
$432,000, names ASB as the lender, and provides "[b]orrower has
 
promised to pay this debt in regular Periodic Payments and to pay
 
the debt in full not later than June 1, 2008" and that the
 
borrower would execute a balloon rider and a 1-4 family rider.3
 
Riddel and the Paiks' signatures are provided on two separate
 "page 12" documents to this Mortgage. The Mortgage identified
 
the "Note" as "the promissory note signed by Borrower and dated
 
May 29, 2007" (Note), which indicated Borrower, Paiks and Riddel,
 
owed Lender, ASB, $432,000 plus interest.
 
A balloon payment rider dated May 29, 2007 and signed
 
by Riddel states the "Note is payable in full at the end of 12
 
months." An identical, undated balloon payment rider also
 
provides for full payment of the mortgage at the end of 12 months
 
and is signed separately by the Paiks. ASB introduced an undated

document signed by Riddel that Damon J. Stanford (Stanford), a
 
Loss Mitigation and Recovery Manager in ASB's Collections and
 
Recovery Services division, declared to be a promissory note,
 
executed on May 29, 2007 for a principal sum of $432,000. This
 
document was titled "Balloon Note" and identified the Property
 
and June 1, 2008 as the maturity date for repayment.
 
An unsigned, undated document entitled "Balloon Payment
 
Rider," which identified the Paiks and Riddel as signatories,
 
provides that it "is incorporated into and shall be deemed to
 
amend and supplement the Mortgage . . . to secure Borrower's
 
promissory note to [ASB]" and that the "Note is payable in full
 
at the end of 36 months."
 
On June 1, 2007, a mortgage on the Property,
 
identifying the Paiks and Riddel as borrowers and June 1, 2008 as
 
the maturity date for repayment of $432,000, was recorded in the
 
Bureau of Conveyances.
 
A Settlement Statement dated June 1, 2007 identified
 
Riddel as the Borrower of $432,000 from ASB, and identified the
 
Property as the subject of the settlement. An "additional
 
deposit" of $3,186.32 was "paid by or in behalf of" the borrower.
 
By letter dated February 2, 2010, ASB informed Riddel
 
that his Mortgage had matured on June 6, 2008 and, pursuant to
 
the Note executed on May 29, 2007, he was now in default and
 
required to pay outstanding amounts totaling $458,666.84 after
 
thirty days. An identical letter was sent to the Paiks on the
 
same day.
 
On May 26, 2010, ASB filed a Complaint against the 
Paiks and Riddel. On June 16, 2010, counsel for ASB informed the 
Paiks and Riddel that the Balloon Note had matured on June 1, 
2008 and the amount due as of June 15, 2010 was $469,741.35. On 
June 17, 2010, ASB filed a First Amended Complaint, which was 
served to the Paiks on July 22, 2010 in Kilauea, Kaua 'i; and 
served to Riddel on July 26, 2010 in Honolulu, O 'ahu. 
In September 2010, Riddel and Stanford exchanged emails 
under the subject title "RE: Short Sale of Land on Kaua[ ']i." 
Riddel contacted Stanford to "resolv[e] the foreclosure of the 
land on Kaua[ ']i" and indicated that he would counter an offer of 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
$295,000 on the property with a proposed sale price of $325,00 in 
order to reduce the deficiency owed to ASB. Stanford replied 
that ASB did not oppose Riddel's counter offer and further 
advised Riddel "that the foreclosure action will continue and 
[sic] until all parties reach a mutually agreed upon resolution 
as to the deficiency and the related terms and conditions." 
Riddel suggested using his "Waikoloa rental on Hawai[ ']i as a 
means to satisfy the agreement amount of settlement. Since ASB agreed less than a year ago to a sale price of 325k plus a 10k 
cash payment, I would propose splitting the difference of the 
sale price now vs. before." Riddel was anxious to complete the 
transactions because his "so called partner on this [P]roperty is 
going to be sentenced [to federal prison] soon (October) and it 
may be difficult to finalize closing documents and signatures 
with him being incarcerated." Stanford replied with ASB's 
counterproposal of a $10,000 cash contribution due at closing and 
a $92,000 promissory note from Riddel, secured by his principal 
residence. Riddel declared that he had contacted Stanford after 
receiving the complaint and began to negotiate a settlement "in 
the belief that no further court action would be taken until our 
settlement discussions concluded[.]" 
On October 14, 2010, ASB filed a request for entry of
 
default against the Paiks and Riddel, who had failed to answer
 
ASB's complaint. Also on October 14, 2010, the circuit court
 
clerk entered default against the Paiks and Riddel.
 
On October 19, 2010, ASB filed a "Motion For Summary
 
Judgment And Decree of Foreclosure Against [the Paiks and Riddel]
 
on First Amended Complaint Filed June 17, 2010" (MSJ/Foreclosure) 
The Note was attached to ASB's motion. Oppositions to the
 
MSJ/Foreclosure were filed by both Riddel and the Paiks, Riddel
 
on March 15, 2011 and the Paiks on April 20, 2011.
 
By letter dated March 15, 2011, which was attached to
 
Riddel's memorandum opposing summary judgment, William C.
 
Sarsfield (Sarsfield), a banking consultant, stated that he had
 
been engaged by the Dubin Law Offices to review the "situation"
 
involving ASB, the Paiks, and Riddel "in order to be prepared to
 
offer expert testimony on the appropriateness and propriety of a
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
real estate loan extended by [ASB] to [Riddel]." Sarsfield has
 
served as an expert witness in numerous court cases. Sarsfield
 
listed documents that he reviewed. Paragraph 5 of the list
 
identified a copy of the Note, requiring payment of $432,000 on a
 
maturity date of June 1, 2008 executed solely by Riddel. 
Sarsfield also reviewed the Mortgage on the Property, "dated May
 
29, 2007, borrower(s) [the Paiks and Riddel], referencing a
 
$432,000 signed by borrower, further noting that all three
 
individuals signed as borrowers, although as [noted] in Paragraph
 
5 above, the [N]ote was only signed by [Riddel]." Sarsfield
 
provided the following opinions: (1) ASB did not conduct its
 
banking relationship with Riddel in a manner consistent with
 
accepted banking practice; (2) ASB breached bank regulatory
 
directives in structuring the vacant land loan to Riddel; (3)
 
Riddel was prejudiced in his ability, as borrower, to fulfill the
 
requirements of the loan as structured by ASB; and (4) ASB
 
engaged in deceptive and unfair practices in its lending
 
relationship with Riddel.
 
On March 17, 2011, ASB filed its reply in support of
 
its MSJ/Foreclosure.
 
On April 11, 2011, Riddel filed his "Motion to Dismiss
 
for Improper Venue or in the Alternative to Transfer Venue
 
Pursuant to Section 603-36(5) [(1993)] and Section 603-37.5
4
[(1993)] of the Hawaii Revised Statutes,"  (Motion to
 
Dismiss/Transfer) and a "Motion to Set Aside the Clerk's Entry of
 
Default" (Motion to Set Aside Default).
 
4
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Â§ 603-37.5, provides:
 
Â§603-37.5 Cure or waiver of defects. (a) The circuit court
of a circuit in which is commenced a civil case laying venue in
the wrong circuit shall transfer the case, upon or without terms
and conditions as the court deems proper, to any circuit in which
it could have been brought, or if it is in the interest of justice
dismiss the case.
 
(b) Nothing in sections 603-36 to 603-37.5 shall
impair the jurisdiction of a circuit court of any matter
involving a party who does not interpose timely and
sufficient objection to the venue.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On April 28, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on 
ASB's MSJ/Foreclosure, and Riddel's Motion to Dismiss/Transfer 
and Motion Set Aside Default. Riddel's counsel restated Riddel's 
position that venue was improper and the Paiks' counsel took no 
position on the issue. ASB's counsel argued that the venue was 
proper but "we're not opposed, or we're not going to strongly 
advocate that the case stay in Kaua[ ']i." The circuit court 
found the venue was proper, although inconvenient for all but one attorney involved in the case, and denied Riddel's Motion to 
Dismiss/Transfer. 
The circuit court granted Riddel's Motion to Set Aside
 
Default. Counsel for both parties agreed the Paiks did not sign
 
the Note and would not be liable for any deficiency. The circuit
 
court found the Paiks did sign the mortgage but did not sign the
 
note.
 
Riddel's counsel argued that ASB's MSJ/Foreclosure
 
should be denied because "there were fraudulent acts in the
 
origination of this [N]ote and [M]ortgage. That means that if
 
what [Riddel] says is proven at trial, then the note and mortgage
 
are void and unenforceable." The circuit court responded: 
Based on the information before the [circuit court],
the [c]ourt looking at the four factors cited by [Bank of
Honolulu N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 654 P.2d 1370
(1982)] there's sufficient evidence of the existence of the
[M]ortgage and [N]ote. The terms of the [M]ortgage and
[N]ote are specified within the [M]ortgage and [N]ote.
There was default by Defendant Riddel, and Defendant Riddel
had the requisite notice. The [circuit court] will be
granting the [MSJ/Foreclosure].
 
On June 22, 2011, the circuit court filed its
 
FOFs/COLs/Order concluding it had jurisdiction over the parties
 
and subject matter of the case, and that venue in the Fifth
 
Circuit was proper. The circuit court also concluded: (1) ASB's
 
Mortgage was a valid first lien on the Property; (2) ASB was
 
entitled to have its Mortgage foreclosed; (3) ASB was due
 
$475,637.24 "plus per diem interest accrual for each day after
 
September 14, 2010 until paid (currently $75.4521 per diem at
 
6.375% per current term)" and other amounts the court would
 
subsequently determine; (4) Riddel would be liable for any
 
deficiency after the sale and rent of the property; and (5) that
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
ASB was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its complaint. 
On June 22, 2011, the circuit court filed its Order
 
Denying Motion to Dismiss and entered Judgment. On July 25,
 
2011, Riddel filed his notice of appeal.
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
We review the circuit court's grant of summary judgment
 
de novo. 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai 'i 90, 
96, 194 P.3d 531, 537 (2008) (citations omitted).
 
Furthermore, in deciding a motion for summary judgment, a
circuit court must keep in mind an important distinction:
 
A judge ruling on a motion for summary judgment cannot
summarily try the facts; his role is limited to applying the
law to the facts that have been established by the
litigants' papers. Therefore, a party moving for summary
judgment is not entitled to a judgment merely because the
facts he offers appear more plausible than those tendered in
opposition or because it appears that the adversary is
unlikely to prevail at trial. This is true even though both
parties move for summary judgment. Therefore, if the
evidence presented on the motion is subject to conflicting
interpretations, or reasonable men might differ as to its
significance, summary judgment is improper.
 
Kajiya v. Dep't of Water Supply, 2 Haw. App. 221, 224, 629 P.2d
635, 638â39 (1981) (quoting 10 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil Â§ 2725 (1973)).
 
Childs v. Harada, 130 Hawai 'i 387, 396, 311 P.3d 710, 719 (App. 
2013) (concluding the lower court exceeded its role in
 
adjudicating the motions for summary judgment by drawing disputed
 
inferences from predicate facts to determine the essential fact
 
at issue). 
Courts will treat the documents submitted in support of a
motion for summary judgment differently from those in
opposition. Although they carefully scrutinize the materials
submitted by the moving party to ensure compliance with the
requirements of Rule 56(e), HRCP (1990), the courts are more
indulgent towards the materials submitted by the non-moving
party. This is because of the drastic nature of summary
judgment proceedings, which should not become a substitute
 
8
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
for existing methods of determining factual issues.

(internal citations omitted). 
A movant has the burden of producing evidence to 
support a motion for summary judgment, however, if "the movant 
does not bear the ultimate burden of persuasion on a particular 
claim at trial, it may satisfy its initial burden by pointing out 
that the record lacks substantial evidence to support a necessary 
element of the nonmovant's claim." Omerod v. Heirs of 
Kaheananui, 116 Hawai 'i 239, 255, 172 P.3d 983, 999 (2007) 
(citation omitted). Substantial evidence is "credible evidence 
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Marvin v. 
Pflueger, 127 Hawai 'i 490, 495, 280 P.3d 88, 93 (2012).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.
 
Riddel contends HRS Â§ 603-36(5) required the 
proceedings be held in the First Circuit because Riddel was domiciled on O
'ahu. Riddel also contends "ASB's own 
[MSJ/Forclosure] recited that the claim for relief arose" in Honolulu. HRS Â§ 603-36(5) provides:
Â§603-36 Actions and proceedings, where to be brought .
 
Actions and proceedings of a civil nature within the jurisdiction
of the circuit courts shall be brought as follows:
 
. . . .
 
(5) Actions other than those specified above shall be
brought in the circuit where the claim for relief arose or
where the defendant is domiciled; provided if there is more
than one defendant, then the action shall be brought in the
circuit in which the claim for relief arose unless a
 majority of the defendants are domiciled in another circuit,
whereupon the action may be brought in the circuit where the
majority of the defendants are domiciled.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Riddel contends that because ASB's "action" did not
 
fall under other provisions of HRS Â§ 603-36(1)-(4) (1993) and
 
ASB's claim for relief arose in Honolulu, where he was domiciled
 
and was served notice of ASB's action, the Fifth Circuit was an
 
improper venue and ASB's action must be dismissed. We disagree. 
The Fifth Circuit was the proper venue and the circuit
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
court did not err by hearing the instant case. The Fifth Circuit 
was the proper venue because ASB brought an action to foreclose 
on the mortgaged property and the property was on Kaua 'i. See 
92A C.J.S. Venue Â§ 23 ("Suits to enforce or foreclose mortgages and other liens ordinarily must be brought in the county where 
the property is situated."). 
Further, the plain terms of HRS Â§ 603-36(5) provide 
that when there is more than one defendant, "the action may be 
brought in the circuit where the majority of defendants are 
domiciled." The Paiks were served with ASB's First Amended 
Complaint in Kilauea, Kaua
'i and were identified in that 
complaint as residents of the County of Kaua 'i, State of Hawai 'i. 
Because the majority of defendants were domiciled in Kaua 'i, the 
Fifth Circuit was a proper venue under HRS Â§ 603-36(5).
B.
 
In granting summary judgment in favor of ASB, the
 
circuit court stated ASB had established facts required under
 
Bank of Honolulu.
 
To be entitled to the remedy sought, the Bank was required
to prove the following material facts: (1) the existence of
the Agreement, (2) the terms of the Agreement, (3) default
by [Defendant] under the terms of the Agreement, and (4) the
giving of the cancellation notice and recordation of an
affidavit to such effect.
 
Id. at 551, 654 P.2d at 1375 (citation omitted).
 
Riddel contends the circuit court erred by finding
 
there was an enforceable contract. He contends the loan terms
 
were switched on him at closing, that ASB "conspired" with the
 
Paiks to qualify Riddel for the ASB loan, and that Sarsfield's
 
expert testimony on ASB's "deceptive" lending practices
 
demonstrated genuine issues of material facts and therefore
 
summary judgment for ASB was wrong. In his opposition to ASB's
 
MSJ/Foreclosure, Riddel contended the Note was an unenforceable
 
contract because it was void as a matter of public policy and
 
constituted fraudulent and an unfair and deceptive act or
 
practice (UDAP) under HRS Â§ 480-2 (2008 Repl.).
 
A UDAP committed "in the conduct of any trade or
 
commerce [is] unlawful." HRS Â§ 480-2(a). A contract or
 
agreement in violation of HRS Chapter 480 is void and not
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
enforceable. See HRS Â§ 480-12 (2008 Repl.). The mortgage loan
 
transaction fell within the ambit of HRS Chapter 480, inasmuch as
 
(1) a loan extended by a financial institution is activity 
involving conduct of any trade and commerce and (2) loan 
borrowers are consumers within the meaning of HRS Â§ 480â1 (2008 
Repl.). See Hawai 'i Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai 'i 
213, 227, 11 P.3d 1, 15 (2000). Hawai 'i's UDAP statute provides 
for "[t]wo distinct causes of action . . . (1) claims alleging 
unfair methods of competition; and (2) claims alleging unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices." Hawai'i Med. Ass'n v. Hawai 'i Med. 
Serv. Ass'n, Inc., 113 Hawai 'i 77, 105, 148 P.3d 1179, 1207 
(2006). Riddel's UDAP claim falls under the latter category. 
In Keka, the defendants' averments raised a genuine 
issue of material fact in response to the plaintiff's summary 
judgment motion that sought entry of foreclosure and a judgment 
dismissing the defendant's UDAP counterclaim. There, the 
defendants alleged the credit union first offered a 7.25% 
interest rate then presented defendants with loan documents 
specifying a 9% interest rate, and "unethically or unscrupulously 
attempted to influence the Kekas to execute them by way of 
further deceptive representations, designed, as the Kekas allege, 
to alleviate their concerns that the interest rate was not that 
for which they had bargained by assuring them that the actual 
rate would be [7.25%.]" Keka, 94 Hawai 'i at 229, 11 P.3d at 17 
(internal quotation marks omitted). The alleged deceptive representation consisted of the credit union's representation to 
the Kekas that there would be "no problem" with changing their 
interest rate later "when the in house rate changes" and 
subsequent inducement of the Kekas' signing a "Notice of the 
Right to Cancel" and "Disclosure Statement . . . ." Keka, 94 
Hawai
'i at 217, 11 P.3d at 5. 
Such conduct would have been (1) unethical, oppressive,
unscrupulous and substantially injurious to consumers and
(2) would have reinforced the tendency to cause the Kekas,
as a natural and probable result, to enter into the
transaction they may otherwise have declined, thus violating
HRS Â§ 480â2 as an unfair and deceptive trade practice. 
Keka, 94 Hawai 'i at 229, 11 P.3d at 17 (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Keka vacated the lower court's summary judgment for the 
credit union concluding that there were geniune issues of 
material fact as to whether the credit union engaged in UDAPs in 
violation of HRS Chapter 480. See Keka, 94 Hawai 'i at 229, 11 
P.3d at 17. Under Keka, Riddel was required to raise a general issue of material fact that the conduct on the part of ASB was 
"unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous and substantially injurious 
to consumers" and "reinforced the tendency to cause" Riddel to 
enter into the loan that he may otherwise have declined. Id. 
Riddel averred that at the time ASB loaned him $432,000
 
he "was led to believe that [he] would have '36 months' in which
 
to repay the principal, which was stated within the first page of
 
a blank 'Balloon Payment Rider' I received from [ASB] just prior
 
to closing . . . ." According to Riddel, "unknown to me at the
 
time, the maturity date was switched on me at closing to '12
 
months[.]'"
 
ASB contends Riddel "claims that the payment terms of 
the [N]ote were switched prior to closing, and yet there is no 
dispute that he still signed the [N]ote." The question of 
whether Riddel signed the Note, however, is distinct from whether 
ASB engaged in deceptive practices that led him to sign. See 
Keka, 94 Hawai
'i at 299-30, 11 P.3d at 17-18. If, as Riddel 
declares, ASB led him to believe his debt would mature for 
repayment at the end of 36 months, as indicated in documents 
allegedly provided to him by ASB, and the maturity date was 
switched on him at closing to 12 months thereby imposing "an 
unfair and impractical burden on [him] to pay off the principal 
of the loan in so short a time," then there is a genuine issue as 
to whether ASB's conduct constituted a UDAP and whether the Note 
would be a void contract under HRS Â§ 480-12. Riddel thus raised 
a genuine issue of material fact regarding the validity of the 
Note and MSJ/Foreclosure for ASB constituted reversible error. 
Riddel also alleged that Hee, ASB's loan officer, had
 
Kevyn sign a notarized statement that claimed that Kevyn had
 
gifted Riddel $60,000 toward the down payment on the Property to
 
enable Riddel to qualify for the loan. Riddel declared these
 
events were unknown to him at the time of closing. Riddel's

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declaration that Kevyn, Hee, or an undiscovered party created 
this document and that Riddel did not receive a $60,000 "gift" 
from Kevyn, sufficiently alleged a deceptive practice. Not 
knowing that he would not qualify for the $432,000 loan or that a 
$60,000 "gift" had been fabricated to establish his qualification 
would be a reinforcement of the tendency to cause Riddel, "as a 
natural and probable result, to enter into the transaction [he] 
may otherwise have declined . . . ." Keka, 94 Hawai 'i at 229, 11 
P.3d at 17. Riddel's declaration that a $60,000 "gift" had been fabricated to qualify him for the ASB loan raised a genuine issue 
of material fact, which rendered summary judgment an 
inappropriate method of disposing of ASB's claim.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the June 22, 2011
 
"Order Denying Defendant John Riddel, Jr.'s Motion to Dismiss for
 Improper Venue, Filed April 7, 2011"; vacate the June 22, 2011
 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against All Defendants on First Amended Complaint, Filed June 17,
 
2010"; and vacate the June 22, 2011 "Judgment on Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 
for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
 
Defendants on First Amended Complaint, Filed June 17, 2010" all
 
filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit. This case is
 
remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent
 
with this opinion. Because we vacate the circuit court's
 
FOF/COL/Order, Riddel's second and third points on appeal are
 
moot.
