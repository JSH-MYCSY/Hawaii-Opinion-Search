(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Morteza Khaleghi and Karen
 
Khaleghi (the Khaleghis) appeal from two Circuit Court of the
 
Second Circuit (Circuit Court) decisions in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Indymac Venture, LLC (Indymac): (1) the June 30, 2011
 
Order Denying [the Khaleghis'] Motion for Relief from Judgment
 
(June 2011 Order), which denied the Khaleghis' Hawaii Rules of
 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to set
 
aside a February 16, 2011 judgment on a decree of foreclosure
 
(February 2011 Judgment); and (2) an October 18, 2011 Rule 54(b)­
certified judgment (October 2011 Judgment) confirming the sale of
 
the Khaleghis' foreclosed property.1 The two appeals were
 
consolidated under No. CAAP-11-0000843.

The Khaleghis raise two points of error, contending
 
that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) entering a default judgment
 
because Indymac failed to properly serve the Khaleghis; and (2)
 awarding Indymac a deficiency judgment because Indymac had no
 right to a personal judgment against the Khaleghis.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve the Khaleghis' points of error
 as follows:
 
(1) As the Khaleghis' motion for relief from judgment 
was premised on the Circuit Court's lack of personal jurisdiction, we review this issue de novo. Wagner v. World 
Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai
'i 190, 195, 268 P.3d 443, 448 
(App. 2011). 
The Khaleghis argue that Indymac's alleged failure to 
properly serve them with process (a summons and complaint) in the foreclosure action rendered the Circuit Court's default judgment against them void for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Khaleghis fall within the ambit of Hawai
'i's long-arm statute, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 634-35 (1993), which provides, in 
relevant part, the following: 
§ 634-35 Acts submitting to jurisdiction. (a) Any
person, whether or not a citizen or resident of this State,
who in person or through an agent does any of the acts
hereinafter enumerated, thereby submits such person, and, if
an individual, the person's personal representative, to the
jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to any cause of
action arising from the doing of any of the acts:
. . . .
 (3) The ownership, use, or possession of any real
estate situated in this State;
 
. . . .
 (d) Nothing herein contained limits or affects the
right to serve any process in any other manner now or
hereafter provided by law.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
Hawai'i's long-arm statute is subject to the 
requirements of due process. Norris v. Six Flags Theme Parks, 
Inc., 102 Hawai 'i 203, 207, 74 P.3d 26, 30 (2003) (stating that 
"[p]ersonal jurisdiction exists when (1) the defendant's activity 
falls under the State's long-arm statute, and (2) the application 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the statute complies with constitutional due process" 
(citation omitted)). Due process requires that courts assert 
personal jurisdiction over a defendant before entering judgment. 
See Rearden Family Trust v. Wisenbaker, 101 Hawai 'i 237, 247, 65 
P.3d 1029, 1039 (2003). "In order for a trial court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the defendant must be served with a copy of the summons and the complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule 4(d)." Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 
422, 430, 16 P.3d 827, 835 (App. 2000). HRCP Rule 4(d)(1)(A) requires "delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the individual personally or in case the individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof at the individual's dwellinghouse or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age
and discretion then residing therein." (Emphasis added.) 
Here, it is undisputed that Indymac did not serve the
 
Khaleghis personally, notwithstanding various attempts to do so. 
Indymac was also apparently unsuccessful with its attempts to
 perfect service via certified mail, as there were certain
 deficiencies in the return receipts (signed, but no printed
 names). Instead, Indymac's service on the Khaleghis was executed
 through substitute service on their 20-year-old daughter, Farrah
 Khaleghi (Farrah), at their California residence. There is no
 
dispute that Indymac's California process server, Jerry Jens (Mr.
 
Jens) delivered the summons and complaint to the Khaleghis'
 
"dwelling house or usual place of abode"; namely, their
 
California residence located at 1343 Amalfi Drive, Pacific
 Palisades, California. There is also no dispute as to Farrah's
 capacity to receive the documents (i.e., whether she was of
 "suitable age and discretion") because she was a twenty-year-old
 adult with no known mental, or other disqualifying, incapacities. 
Rather, the Khaleghis argue that service was not effective
 because Farrah was not "then residing" in the Khaleghis'
 California residence when she was served. The Khaleghis admit
 that they had actual notice of the suit in November 2010 (Indymac
 asserts they had actual notice in May 2010, when they received
 copies of the complaint and summons by certified mail), months

prior to the entry of the February 2011 Judgment, but declined to
 
file a motion to set aside the entry of default.
 
It is well-settled that Rule 4 should be construed
 
liberally and flexibly, particularly where, as in this case, a
 defendant has received actual notice of an action. See, e.g., 
Borzeka v. Heckler, 739 F.2d 444, 447 (9th Cir. 1984) (citing,
 inter alia, Nowell v. Nowell, 384 F.2d 951, 953 (5th Cir. 1967);
 Karlsson v. Rabinowitz, 318 F.2d 666, 668 (4th Cir. 1963);
 Rovinski v. Rowe, 131 F.2d 687, 689 (6th Cir. 1942)). Although
 there are cases to the contrary, many courts have held that
 service on a person at the defendant's residence who is linked by
 a substantial nexus to the defendant, such as a close relative,
 constitutes effective service of process. See, e.g. Wichert v.
 
Cardwell, 812 P.2d 858 (Wash. 1991) (defendant's adult daughter,
 who was watching her parents' home and staying overnight, was
 capable of receiving substitute service on behalf of her parents
 notwithstanding that "[t]he daughter lived in her own apartment,
 was self-supporting and had no personal possessions at the
 residence"); M. Lowenstein & Sons, Inc. v. Austin, 430 F. Supp.
 
844, 845 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (explaining that service on defendant's
 adult daughter at defendant's residence satisfied residency
 requirement for substitute service, even though daughter was just
 visiting home from college); O'Sell v. Peterson, 595 N.W.2d 870,
 873 (Minn. Ct. App. 1999) (holding that there was effective
 substitute service where summons and complaint were left with
 defendant's 14-year-old stepson who was staying at defendant's
 home for six-day, non-custodial visitation); Glover v. Farmer,
 490 S.E.2d 576, 576-78 (N.C. Ct. App. 1997) (holding that
 defendant's adult daughter, who was visiting parents' home for a
 week, was residing in defendants' home for purposes of substitute
 service); Nowell, 384 F.2d 951 (5th Cir. 1967) (finding adequate
 substitute service based upon a substantial nexus between
 defendant and his landlord who resided in a separate apartment
 building from defendant, though court found an absence of nexus
 between tenants in the same building); Plushner v. Mills, 429
 A.2d 444, 445-46 (R.I. 1981) (concluding that substitute service
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on defendant's daughter, who was watching defendant's home but
 
not staying overnight, was valid because she was a trusted member
 of the household and had a substantial nexus with defendant). 
We conclude that the service of Farrah at the
 
Khaleghis' residence constituted effective substitute service
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 4(d)(1)(A) under the circumstances in this
 case. Farrah is their daughter, a strong and direct familial
 relationship and one that typically engenders trust and shared
 responsibility for the family's well-being. The record is silent
 regarding the duration of her stay at the residence, but her
 declaration confirms that she was "visiting" the Khaleghis' home
 and not just there by chance. Service on Farrah at the
 Khaleghis' residence was reasonably calculated to reach the
 Khaleghis, and it was reasonable to expect that Farrah would
 alert her parents to the documents, as she was their 20-year-old
 daughter. See Wichert, 812 P.2d at 860 (explaining that
 
"[s]ervice upon a defendant's adult child . . . [may be
 considered] reasonably calculated to accomplish notice to the
 defendant" and that "[w]hen defendant is absent, the person in
 possession of the house of usual abode is likely to present the
 papers to the defendant, particularly when that person is a
 family member"). Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err when
 it exercised personal jurisdiction over the Khaleghis.
 
(2) The Khaleghis also contend that the Circuit Court 
erred when it awarded a deficiency judgment against them because "Indymac was only entitled to an in rem, or res, judgment against the Khaleghis." This argument is without merit. HRS § 634­23(4) allows adjudication to reach beyond "the property, status or res which is the subject of the action" if, inter alia, "the service is authorized by section 634-25 or other provision of law, in which case the defendant shall be liable to any judgment authorized by such law." Here, service was authorized by Hawai
'i's long-arm statute provisions, specifically HRS § 634-36. 
Substitute service is included within the "personal" service contemplated in HRS § 634–36. See HRCP Rule 4. Therefore, the 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Circuit Court did not err in entering a deficiency judgment
 
against the Khaleghis and in favor of Indymac.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's June 2011 Order
 
and October 2011 Judgment are affirmed.
