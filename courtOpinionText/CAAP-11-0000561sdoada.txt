SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Mario Rimarim (Rimarim) appeals
 
from the "Order Denying Defendant Mario Rimarim's Motion To Set
 
Aside Default And Summary Judgment Filed April 29, 2011" (Order
 Denying 60(b) Motion), filed on July 7, 2011, by the Circuit
 Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court).

On appeal, Rimarim raises the following points of
 
error: (1) the complaint by Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National
 Association, Trustee (U.S. Bank) was dismissed with prejudice and
 was not set aside in a timely manner; and (2) the circuit court
 erred in not setting aside an entry of default against Rimarim
 and summary judgment against Rimarim because of "excusable

neglect on the part of Rimarim, the existence of meritorious
 
defenses, and the lack of prejudice [to U.S. Bank] to have to
 litigate on the merits."
 
Rimarim's Opening Brief fails to comply with Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 for a variety of reasons, including that: the citations to the record appear incorrect in many instances such that they do not support the 
2
assertions made;  the brief fails to provide any record citation
in support of certain asserted facts; and with regard to his
 points of error, Rimarim fails to state "where in the record the
 alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged
 error was brought to the attention of the court or agency." HRAP
 Rule 28(b)(3) and (4)(iii).
3 Notwithstanding these violations,
 
given this court's policy of seeking to address appeals on their
 merits, we have attempted to address the points raised by Rimarim
 to the extent possible.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the opening brief
 
4
submitted by Rimarim  and having given due consideration to the
arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant
 authorities, we resolve Rimarim's points of error as follows and
 affirm.
 
I. Procedural Background
 
U.S. Bank filed the Complaint on January 19, 2007,
 
seeking foreclosure and recovery under a promissory note executed
 by Rimarim. On November 27, 2007, the circuit court issued an
 "Order of Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 29 of the Rules of the

 U.S. Bank failed to file an answering brief and we denied its request 
to set aside its default of the answering brief. Nonetheless, the burden ison Rimarim as the appellant to establish his right to relief on appeal.Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai' i 277,

Circuit Court", purporting to dismiss the action with prejudice
 
for want of prosecution, but providing that the dismissal could
 be set aside for good cause shown upon motion within ten days. 
More than ten days later, on January 30, 2008, and pursuant to
 Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b), U.S. Bank
 filed a motion to set aside the order of dismissal. According to
 a notice of hearing and certificate of service, Rimarim was
 served with this motion. On May 16, 2008, the circuit court
 granted U.S. Bank's motion to set aside the dismissal order. 
On May 21, 2008, the circuit court clerk entered
 
default against Rimarim for failure to answer the complaint or to
 appear in the case. However, judgment was not entered against
 Rimarim based on the default. Rather, U.S. Bank thereafter filed
 a motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure on
 June 4, 2008, which the record reflects was served on Rimarim. 
On August 7, 2008, the circuit court issued an order
 
granting summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure to U.S.
 Bank. On the same date, the circuit court entered judgment
 pursuant to its summary judgment ruling and decree of
 foreclosure. 
On September 28, 2009, the circuit court entered an
 
order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property and also
 entered a judgment on the order confirming the sale of the
 foreclosed property.
 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 667-51
 
5
(2013 Supp.),  Rimarim could have appealed from the judgment on
5 HRS ยง 667-51 states:
 
[ยง667-51] Appeals.  (a) Without limiting the class
of orders not specified in section 641-1 from which appeals
may also be taken, the following orders entered in a
foreclosure case shall be final and appealable:

sale or an adjudication of a movant's right to a
deficiency judgment, or both, then the order of
sale or the adjudication of liability for the

the decree of foreclosure filed on August 7, 2008, or from the
 
judgment on the order confirming sale of the foreclosed property
 filed on September 28, 2009. Rimarim did not appeal from either
 judgment.
 
Rather, on April 29, 2011, Rimarim filed a motion to
 
set aside the entry of default against him, as well as the
 summary judgment and decree of foreclosure entered by the circuit
 court on August 7, 2008 in favor of U.S. Bank. This motion was
 filed more than two and a half years after the August 7, 2008
 judgment on the decree of foreclosure had been entered, and was
 brought pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b).
 
On July 7, 2011, the circuit court entered the Order
 
Denying 60(b) Motion. On July 22, 2011, Rimarim filed the
 instant appeal from the Order Denying 60(b) Motion.
 
II. Rimarim's Appeal From the Order Denying 60(b) Motion
 
In his opening brief, Rimarim's first point of error
 
and his entire argument section are asserted as if he had
 directly appealed from the judgment on the decree of foreclosure
 entered on August 7, 2008 (which appeal would have included the
 setting aside of the dismissal and the entry of default against
 
5(...continued)
 
deficiency judgment also shall be deemed final
and appealable;
 
(2)	 A judgment entered on an order confirming the
sale of the foreclosed property, if the circuit
court expressly finds that no just reason for
delay exists, and certifies the judgment as
final pursuant to rule 54(b) of the Hawaii rules
of civil procedure; and
 
(3)	 A deficiency judgment; provided that no appeal
from a deficiency judgment shall raise issues
relating to the judgment debtor's liability for
the deficiency judgment (as opposed to the
amount of the deficiency judgment), nor shall
the appeal affect the finality of the transfer
of title to the foreclosed property pursuant to
the order confirming sale.
 
(b) An appeal shall be taken in the manner and within
the time provided by the rules of court.

Rimarim as interlocutory orders to the judgment). This is not
 
the case. As noted, Rimarim did not appeal from the circuit
 court's judgment entered on August 7, 2008, but rather, he
 appealed only from the much later Order Denying 60(b) Motion. 
Therefore, we only have jurisdiction to review the circuit
 court's rulings relating to the Order Denying 60(b) Motion. The
 opening brief fails to present any argument why the circuit court
 erred in denying Rimarim's HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, including
 under which specific subsection of HRCP Rule 60(b) the circuit
 court should have granted relief. Thus, Rimarim's arguments
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), the only basis for his appeal, have
 been waived. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points not presented in
 accordance with this section will be disregarded[.]"); HRAP Rule
 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
 
Even if we consider Rimarim's arguments made in his
 
April 29, 2011 motion before the circuit court, the relief he
 sought therein pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), (4) and (6) was
 properly denied.
 
To seek relief under Rule 60(b)(1), a motion must be 
filed within one year of the judgment or order from which relief is sought. See Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 
Hawai
'i 190, 194-95, 268 P.3d 443, 447-48 (App. 2011). Rimarim's 
April 29, 2011 motion was filed more than one year after the August 7, 2008 judgment and decree of foreclosure from which he sought relief. 
A request for relief under Rule 60(b)(4) need not be 
brought within a year, but Rimarim was required to show that the judgment and decree of foreclosure was void. 126 Hawai
'i at 195, 
P.3d at 448. In turn, "[a] judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." Id. (quoting In re Genesys Data Techs., Inc., 
95 Hawai
'i 33, 38, 18 P.3d 895, 900 (2001)). Rimarim made no 
argument or showing to establish that the August 7, 2008 judgment and decree of foreclosure were void. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, to the extent that Rimarim sought relief under 
Rule 60(b)(6), he was required to show "that (1) the motion is 
based on some reason other than those specifically stated in clauses 60(b)(1) through (5); (2) there are exceptional circumstances justifying relief; and (3) the motion is made within a reasonable time." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 
Hawai
'i 128, 149, 254 P.3d 439, 460 (2011) (citing Hayashi v. 
Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. 286, 290, 666 P.2d 171, 174โ75 (1983)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Rimarim failed to make a showing entitling him to relief under Rule 60(b)(6). 
Although we do not necessarily agree with the reasoning 
relied upon by the circuit court in its Order Denying 60(b) Motion, which did not focus on Rule 60(b) criteria, the circuit court nonetheless properly denied Rimarim's Rule 60(b) motion. See Kiehm v. Adams, 109 Hawai
'i 296, 301, 126 P.3d 339, 344 
(2005) (stating that "the appellate court may affirm a lower court's decision on any ground in the record supporting affirmance, even if not cited by the lower court."). 
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Order Denying Defendant
 
Mario Rimarim's Motion To Set Aside Default And Summary Judgment
 entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on July 7, 2011
 is affirmed.
