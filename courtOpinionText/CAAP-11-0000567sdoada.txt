Defendant-Appellant Alfredo Bautista appeals from his
 
convictions, which were entered initially on March 23, 2011 in
 
the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division
 
1
 for (1) Operating a Vehicle Under the
 (district court),Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
2

Involving Damage to Vehicle or Property in violation of HRS
 
3
§ 291C-13 (Supp. 2011);  (3) Inattention to Driving in violation
4
HRS § 291-12 (Supp. 2011) (Inattention);  and (4) Harassment in
violation of HRS § 711-1106(1)(A) (Supp. 2011) (Harassment).5
 
Bautista asserts three points of error:6 (1) The
 
complaint failed to specify that he violated HRS § 291E-61(a)
 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; (2) The district court
 
erred in convicting him of Harassment under HRS § 711-1106(1)
 
because it based its determination on a finding of recklessness
 
instead of the necessary intent to harass, annoy or alarm the
 
complainant; [Id. at 10-11.] and (3) The district court erred in
 
convicting him of a violation of HRS § 291-12 because it failed
 
to find that Bautista acted intentionally, knowingly or
 
recklessly.
 
3 HRS § 291C-13 provides in part,
 
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting
only in damage to a vehicle or other property that is driven
or attended by any person shall immediately stop such
vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as
 possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in every event
shall remain at, the scene of the accident until the driver
has fulfilled the requirements of section 291C-14
[describing duty to give information and render aid].
 
4 HRS § 291-12 provides,
 
"Whoever operates any vehicle without due care or in a
manner as to cause a collision with, or injury or damage to,
as the case may be, any person, vehicle or other property
shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more
than thirty days, or both, and may be subject to a surcharge
of up to $100 which shall be deposited into the trauma
system special fund."
 
5
 HRS § 711-1106(1)(A) provides, "A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that
person [s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another person in an
offensive manner or subjects the other person to offensive physical contact."
 
6
 Although Bautista asks that his "convictions" be reversed, he
provides no argument that the adjudication Count Two, Accident Involving
Damage to Vehicle or Property under HRS § 291C-13, is infirm. Therefore, we
leave undisturbed the judgment against him on this traffic infraction. See
 
Hall v. State, 10 Haw. App. 210, 218, 863 P.2d 344, 348 (1993) (disregarding
points of error for failure to present discernible arguments supporting those
assignments of error).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (the State) 
requests that judgment be vacated and the case dismissed without 
prejudice as to the OUVII charge based on State v. Wheeler, 121 
Hawai'i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009). Finally, the State 
asks that judgment be vacated and the case remanded for retrial on the Inattention charge. 
Based on our review of the issues raised, the positions
 
of the parties and the record, we resolve Bautista's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) Bautista challenges the OVUII charge and the State 
agrees that the charge should be dismissed without prejudice 
based on Wheeler because it does not contain the "public roads or 
highway" definition of operating a vehicle. Our review of the 
charge reveals the State's concession of error is well-founded. 
See State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai' i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) 
("it is incumbent on the appellate court first to ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the record and well-
founded in law") (citation, internal quotation marks, brackets, 
and ellipsis omitted). 
(2) In its determination as to Count Four, the
 
district court found that there was sufficient evidence to
 
believe that Bautista touched the complainant's shoulder and
 
dragged his hand down to her right breast with "at least with
 
reckless disregard that it was an offensive touching and that he
 
therefore is guilty of the harassment." Bautista argues that the
 
district court erred in convicting him of Harassment under HRS §
 
711-1106(1) because it based its determination on a finding of
 
recklessness instead of the necessary intent to harass, annoy or
 
alarm the complainant. The State concedes that in the instant
 
case, the district court erred in its ruling that recklessness
 
sufficed for the mens rea element of harassment.
 
A finding that a defendant acted with a reckless state 
of mind is insufficient to support a conviction for Harassment 
under HRS § 711-1106(1). See State v. Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai' i 
290, 300-01, 22 P.3d 86, 96-97 (App. 2001). On the other hand, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the district court's use of the phrase "at least" strongly
 
implies that the district court did not make a definitive finding
 
that Bautista did not act with the necessary mens rea and the
 
district court's finding that there was sufficient evidence of
 
touching was sufficient evidence of offensive physical conduct to
 
otherwise sustain the charge. Accordingly, the judgment as to
 
Count Four is vacated and remanded for retrial. Id. at 301, 22
 
P.3d at 97.
 
(3) Bautista asserts that the district court erred in 
convicting him of Inattention because it failed to find that Bautista acted intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. The 
district court made a general finding of guilt as to all counts. 
As neither party requested specific findings of fact, this issue 
has been waived. State v. Bush, 98 Hawai' i 459, 461, 50 P.3d 
428, 430 (App. 2002). 
Therefore, we affirm the District Court of the Second
 
Circuit, Wailuku Divison's July 25, 2011 "Amended Judgment and
 Order Consolidating Judgments of all Counts and Order of
 
Discharge of Restitution" as to Counts Two and Three, vacate the
 
judgment as to Count Four and remand it for retrial, and instruct
 
the district court on remand to dismiss Count One without
 
prejudice.
