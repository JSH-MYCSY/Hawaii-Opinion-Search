Employer-Appellee/Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2008-258 (2-02-40713))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
  
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise, and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant John E. Custino, Jr. (
Custino) 
appeals from a Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board 
(LIRAB) May 12, 2011 Decision and Order that affirmed in part, 
modified in part, and vacated in part the Director of the 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations' (the Director) 
Decision and Amended Decision regarding benefits for temporary 
total disability (TTD) for an injury that Custino suffered while 
working as an employee for Employer-Appellee State of Hawai 'i, 
Department of Transportation (DOT). Custino also appeals from 
the LIRAB'S June 28, 2011 Order Denying Motion for 
Reconsideration. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
I. Background Facts
 
On July 11, 2002, Custino sustained a work injury to
 
his neck and lower back while working for the DOT. The injury
 
occurred when the truck he was driving was rear-ended by a
 private vehicle, which struck the attenuator (special bumper) of
 Custino's truck while it was stopped. Custino sought medical
 treatment for his injuries on July 15, 2002 with Dr. Richard
 Kimura (Dr. Kimura), an orthopedic surgeon, who was Custino's
 
attending physician throughout his treatment. Custino also
 
visited various other doctors over the course of his treatment. 
On August 14, 2002, a WC-1 Employer's Report of Industrial Injury
 dated July 22, 2002 was filed at the Department of Labor and
 Industrial Relations, Disability Compensation Division (DCD); the
 
DOT subsequently accepted liability for Custino's workers'
 
compensation claim for his shoulders and back. 
In a letter to the DOT dated April 15, 2004, Dr. Kimura
 
stated that Custino could not return to permanent, regular work
 as a heavy truck driver, and he also advised that Custino not
 engage in any "repetitive bending, squatting, turning, and
 bending of his neck." On June 1, 2004, the DOT informed Custino
 that due to him being precluded from regular work, his options
 going forward were either participating in the DOT's Return to
 Work Priority Program (RTWPP), resigning, or retiring. Custino
 
chose to participate in the RTWPP, though ultimately no position
 
could be identified for him in the program given his education,
 experience, training, and physical requirements. Thus, he was
 discharged from his job with the DOT as a heavy truck driver
 (effective January 31, 2005) and advised to contact the DCD to
 inquire about his right to participate in vocational
 rehabilitation services. Custino completed an Employee
 Retirement System (ERS) application, and he selected April 1,
 
2005 as his effective retirement date for ordinary retirement. 
Custino went through two periods of vocational
 
rehabilitation: one from February 3, 2005 to August 10, 2005,
 
and the other from September 16, 2005 to October 27, 2005. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, both vocational rehabilitation periods were terminated
 
due to the infeasibility of Custino finding suitable, gainful
 employment. On January 16, 2008, the DOT sent Custino and the
 Director a letter notifying them that the DOT would be
 terminating Custino's TTD benefits effective January 31, 2008
 because Custino would be receiving retirement benefits at that
 time. The DOT also stated that it would be seeking a
 credit/reimbursement of TTD benefits paid after Custino's 
April 1, 2005 retirement date. 
A hearing was held at the DCD on March 3, 2008 on the
 
issue of permanent disability and temporary total disability,
 specifically addressing the issues of whether "the injury of
 7/11/2002 result[ed] in any permanent partial disability or
 disfigurement, or permanent total disability" and whether the DOT
 was "due any credit on any payments made for temporary total
 disability." The Director issued a Decision on April 30, 2008.
 On June 6, 2008, the Director issued an Amended Decision,
 awarding Custino TTD benefits from July 18, 2002 through October
 
1
27, 2005 (pursuant to HRS § 386-31(b)  ).  The Director rejected
 
the DOT's request for credit on TTD benefits that Custino
 received while simultaneously receiving retirement benefits and
 ordered the DOT to pay weekly permanent total disability (
PTD)
 
1 HRS § 386-31(b) (Supp. 2013) states, in relevant part, the
following:
 
§ 386-31 Total disability.
. . . .
 
(b) Temporary total disability. Where a work
injury causes total disability not determined to be
permanent in character, the employer, for the duration
of the disability, but not including the first three
calendar days thereof, shall pay the injured employee
a weekly benefit at the rate of sixty-six and
two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly
wages, subject to the limitations on weekly benefit
rates prescribed in subsection (a), or if the
employee's average weekly wages are less than the
minimum weekly benefit rate prescribed in subsection
(a), at the rate of one hundred per cent of the
employee's average weekly wages. . . .

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2
benefits (pursuant to HRS § 386-31(a)  ) from October 28, 2005
onward "for as long as the claimant is so disabled." 
The DOT appealed this decision to the LIRAB, and on
 
July 21, 2008, the LIRAB entered a Pretrial Order stating that
 
the issues to be determined were: 
(1) the period of TTD
 
resulting from Custino's work injury; (2) whether Custino was
 permanently and totally disabled as a result of the work injury;
 and (3) if he was not, then what was the extent of permanent
 partial disability (PPD) resulting from the work injury. The
 
Director's case file was made part of the record before the
 
LIRAB. The LIRAB held an evidentiary hearing on April 21, 2009. 
On May 12, 2011, the LIRAB entered a Decision and Order
 
that affirmed in part, modified in part, and vacated in part the
 Director's April 30, 2008 Decision and June 6, 2008 Amended
 Decision. The LIRAB found that Custino was temporarily and
 totally disabled pursuant to HRS § 386-31(b) beginning July 18,
 2002 through February 2, 2005. It also found Custino temporarily
 and totally disabled pursuant to HRS § 386-25(d) (Supp. 2013)
3
 
during the vocational rehabilitation periods of February 3, 2005
 to August 10, 2005 and September 16, 2005 to October 27, 2005.
4
 
2 HRS § 386-31(a) (1993) states, in relevant part, the following:
 
§ 386-31 Total disability.
(a) Permanent total disability. Where a work
injury causes permanent total disability the employer
shall pay the injured employee a weekly benefit equal
to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's
average weekly wages . . . .
 
3 HRS § 386-25(d) states, in relevant part, the following:
 
§ 386-25 Vocational rehabilitation. 
. . . .
 
(d) A provider shall submit an initial
evaluation report of the employee to the employer and
the director within forty-five days of the date of
referral or selection. The evaluation shall determine
 whether the employee requires vocational
rehabilitation services to return to suitable gainful
employment, identify the necessary services, and state
whether the provider can provide these services. . . . 
4
 The LIRAB noted that "[a]lthough [the DOT] paid [Custino] TTD
benefits beginning August 11, 2005 through September 15, 2005, the record does
not include any disability certification supporting a finding of TTD for that
(continued...)
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The LIRAB awarded TTD to Custino, "based on disability
 
certification provided by Dr. Kimura which is part of the record
 on appeal," for the following periods: March 13, 2008 to April
 10, 2008; June 12, 2008 to July 10, 2008; August 7, 2008 to
 November 6, 2008; and January 8, 2009 to February 5, 2009. The
 LIRAB also concluded that Custino could be entitled to TTD after
 February 5, 2009 if there was proper disability certification or
 if he enrolled in a vocational rehabilitation program, and it
 held that vocational rehabilitation would not preclude him from
 receiving his vested retirement benefits or receiving TTD
 benefits pursuant to HRS § 386-25(d).  The LIRAB concluded that
 
it was premature to make a determination about PTD or the extent
 
of PPD because Custino had not exhausted his options for finding
 work through the vocational rehabilitation process before the
 determination was made to close those services; as such, the
 LIRAB stated that Custino should be given the opportunity to 
re-enroll in vocational rehabilitation in order to find himself
 suitable employment. 
On June 9, 2011, Custino filed a Motion for
 
Reconsideration of the LIRAB's May 12, 2011 Decision and Order,
 arguing that the LIRAB should amend its Decision and Order to
 award TTD benefits to him for the period of July 18, 2002 through
 February 5, 2009 because "1) disability certifications were
 timely and contemporaneously completed by [Custino's] attending
 physician for all the 'missing' periods specified in the Decision
 and 2) such disability certifications were submitted to [the DOT]
 on a regular and timely basis." The LIRAB denied Custino's
 Motion for Reconsideration on June 28, 2011. On July 27, 2011,
 Custino filed a timely notice of appeal.
II. Points of Error on Appeal
 
Custino raises the following points of error on appeal: 
(1) "[t]he LIRAB's Decision and Order of May 12, 2011 declining
 
to award TTD benefits for the specified periods was clearly
 
4(...continued)
period." 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erroneous and wrong"; and (2) "[t]he LIRAB's refusal to take the
  
new evidence proffered by Claimant in his Motion for
 
Reconsideration and to amend its Decision and Order based on the
 new evidence was an abuse of discretion."
  
III. Standards of Review
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated that the following 
standard of review is applicable regarding an appeal of a LIRAB
 decision:
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed
by HRS § 91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the
case with instructions for further proceedings;
or it may reverse or modify the decision and
order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions,
or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or
statutory provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority
or jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the
reliable, probative, and substantial
evidence on the whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or
characterized by abuse of discretion or
clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion.
 
We have previously stated: 
FOFs are reviewable under the
 
clearly erroneous standard to determine if
the agency decision was clearly erroneous
in view of reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence on the whole record. 
COLs are freely reviewable to
determine if the agency's decision was in
violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions, in excess of statutory
authority or jurisdiction of agency, or
affected by other error of law.
 
A COL that presents mixed questions
of fact and law is reviewed under the
 clearly erroneous standard because the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
conclusion is dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. When
mixed questions of law and fact are
presented, an appellate court must give
deference to the agency's expertise and
experience in the particular field. The
court should not substitute its own
 judgment for that of the agency.

573-74 (2001) (citations, internal quotation marks, and original 
brackets omitted). 
The court's articulation of the "clearly erroneous"
 
standard is as follows:
 
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact
 
is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to
support the finding or determination, the appellate
court is left with the definite and firm conviction
 that a mistake has been made. We have defined
 substantial evidence as credible evidence which is of
 sufficient quality and probative value to enable a
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

Motions for reconsideration are reviewed for abuse of 
discretion. See Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 
Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992); Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. 
Ctr. for Women & Children, 93 Hawai 'i 116, 126, 997 P.2d 42, 52 
(App. 2000) (stating that "[i]t has been consistently held that rehearings before administrative bodies are addressed to their own discretion, and only a showing of the clearest abuse of discretion could sustain an exception to that rule" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). An abuse of discretion occurs when the [LIRAB] has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." See Amfac, Inc., 
74 Haw. at 114, 839 P.2d at 26 (citation omitted); Bocalbos, 93 Hawai
'i at 126, 997 P.2d at 52. The purpose of a motion for 
reconsideration is not "to relitigate old matters" though. Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of Pac., Inc., 73 Haw. 276, 287 n.7, 831 P.2d 1335, 1342 n.7 (1992). Rather, it "is to allow the parties 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been
 
presented" in an earlier proceeding. See Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at
 
114, 839 P.2d at 27 (citations omitted).
IV.	 Discussion
 
A.	 The LIRAB's May 12, 2011 Decision and Order Declining
to Award Certain Periods of TTD Benefits
 
Custino argues that the LIRAB clearly erred when in its
 
May 12, 2011 Decision and Order it "declin[ed] to award TTD for
 
[certain] specified periods due to lack of disability
 certification." Specifically, Custino asserts that the LIRAB
 should have awarded TTD benefits for the following "gap" periods: 
August 11, 2005 through September 15, 2005; October 28, 2005
 through March 12, 2008; April 11, 2008 through June 11, 2008;
 July 11, 2008 through August 6, 2008; and November 7, 2008
 through January 7, 2009. Custino claims that "the reliable,
 probative and substantial evidence supports a finding" that TTD
 was warranted for these "gap" periods. We disagree. 
Aside from the initial, undisputed July 18, 2002
 
through February 2, 2005 period and the two vocational
 rehabilitation periods, the LIRAB based its award of TTD benefits
 for the other specified periods in its Decision and Order "on
 disability certification provided by Dr. Kimura which [w]as part
 of the record on appeal." In the administrative record at the
 time of the trial on April 21, 2009, there were six disability
 certificates submitted by Dr. Kimura, which correspond with the
 periods in which TTD was awarded. However, the record at the
 time lacked any disability certificates to support a TTD award
 for the "gap" periods. 
Although Dr. Kimura had filled out various WC-2
 
Physician's Reports that were included in the record, they did
 not contain sufficient information to support a determination
 that Custino should be entitled to TTD benefits. HRS § 386-96
 
5
(Supp. 2013)  governs the reports of physicians and requires that
5
 HRS § 386-96 states, in relevant part, the following:
 
(continued...)
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
one rendering "service to an injured employee shall make a report
 
of the injury and treatment on forms prescribed by and to be
 obtained from the [Department of Labor and Industrial
 Relations]," which would include the WC-2 Physicians Report. 
Among the HRS § 386-96 requirements is that physicians treating
 the injured worker report information regarding "the dates of
 disability, any work restrictions, and the return to work date." 
HRS § 386-96(a)(2); 
see also  Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR)
 
§ 12-15-80(a)(3)(E) (West 2014) (stating that interim WC-2
 reports should be submitted to the employer and should include,
 inter alia, the "[d]ates of disability, work restrictions, if
 
5(...continued)
§ 386-96 Reports of physicians, surgeons, and
hospitals. (a) Any physician, surgeon, or hospital that has
given any treatment or rendered any service to an injured
employee shall make a report of the injury and treatment on
forms prescribed by and to be obtained from the department
as follows:
 
(1)	 Within seven days after the date of first
attendance or service rendered, an initial
report shall be made to the department and to
the employer of the injured employee in the
manner prescribed by the department;
(2)	 Interim reports to the same parties and in the
same manner as prescribed in paragraph (1) shall
be made at appropriate intervals to verify the
claimant's current diagnosis and prognosis, that
the information as to the nature of the
 examinations and treatments performed is
complete, including the dates of those
treatments and the results obtained within the
 current reporting period, the execution of all
tests performed within the current reporting
period and the results of the tests, whether the
injured employee is improving, worsening, or if
"medical stabilization" has been reached, the
dates of disability, any work restrictions, and
the return to work date. When an injured
employee is returned to full-time, regular,
light, part-time, or restricted work, the
attending physician shall submit a report to the
employer within seven calendar days indicating
the date of release to work or medical
 stabilization; and
(3) 	A final report to the same parties and in the
same manner as prescribed in paragraph (1) shall
be made within seven days after termination of
treatment.
 
No physician, surgeon, or hospital that has given any
treatment or rendered any service to an injured
employee shall be required to provide any additional
reports not otherwise mandated by this section.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
any, and return to work date").
 
This information was not included on Dr. Kimura's WC-2 
forms, which precluded the LIRAB from grounding in evidence any 
determination regarding TTD based upon those forms. Claimants should not be denied benefits under Hawai
'i workers' compensation 
law simply because their physician failed to properly enter the requisite report in the prescribed manner. However, the LIRAB needs sufficient evidence to render a TTD decision. Without such evidence, it was not clearly erroneous for the LIRAB to deny awarding TTD benefits for the "gap" periods. See In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai
'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000) 
(showing that clear error only exists if "despite substantial evidence to support the finding or determination, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made" (citation omitted)). Therefore, the LIRAB's May 12, 2011 Decision and Order denying the award of TTD benefits for the so-called "gap" periods (August 11, 2005 through September 15, 2005; October 28, 2005 through March 12, 2008; April 11, 2008 through June 11, 2008; July 11, 2008 through August 6, 2008; and November 7, 2008 through January 7, 2009) was not "clearly erroneous and wrong."
B.	 The LIRAB's Denial of Custino's Motion for
 
Reconsideration
 
Custino argues that "[t]he LIRAB's refusal to take the
 
new evidence proffered by [Custino] in his Motion for
 
Reconsideration and to amend its Decision and Order based on the
 new evidence was an abuse of discretion." The new evidence that
 Custino refers to is Dr. Kimura's disability certifications for
 the gap periods. Custino argues that, despite this evidence
 being available before the April 21, 2009 hearing, it should
 still be considered new evidence for the purposes of his Motion
 for Reconsideration because the LIRAB's Decision and Order
 created a new issue that was not the focus of the case at trial —
 namely, the issue of TTD benefits after October 27, 2005. 
Custino makes the following argument:
 
At trial, the focus of the case was whether
 
10
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[Custino] was entitled to a determination of PTD or
PPD after closure of [vocational rehabilitation] on
October 27, 2005. Both parties agreed that [Custino]
was entitled to TTD benefits up until that date and
thus the only issue was whether he was permanently
totally or partial [sic] disabled after that. The
 existence of disability certifications was not an
issue in dispute. When the [LIRAB] held that the
determination of permanent disability was premature
and opened the issue of TTD after October 27, 2005, it
shifted the focus of the case and in effect created a
 new issue of whether disability certifications existed
in support of TTD for the three and a half year period
from October 28, 2005 through February 5, 2009.
 
Custino states that when the LIRAB shifted its focus,
 
"the equities of the situation required that [he] be allowed to
 
present evidence to address [this] issue that had not previously
 been raised" and that "[t]he disability slips were directly
 relevant to the new issue of TTD entitlement created by the"
 LIRAB's Decision and Order on May 12, 2011. 
The DOT disagrees with Custino's characterization of
 
the situation, arguing that he "was neither presenting new
 evidence nor making fresh arguments that could not have been
 presented or made at trial in his motion for reconsideration" and
 that he was essentially "attempt[ing] to relitigate matters that
 should have been addressed prior to the LIRAB's Decision and
 Order." The DOT first points to the LIRAB's July 21, 2008
 Pretrial Order, which stated that one of the issues to be
 determined was "the period of temporary total disability
 resulting from the work injury of July 11, 2002." The DOT also
 references the Pretrial Order's medical reports submission
 deadline of March 10, 2009, arguing that Custino "was well aware
 that any medical evidence he wished to have reviewed by the LIRAB
 in making a determination . . . [about] the issue of temporary
 total disability benefits[] should have been submitted into the
 record" by that deadline.
 
Motions for reconsideration in front of the LIRAB are
 
6
governed by HAR § 12-47-53 (West 2014)  and HRS § 386-87(d)
6
 HAR § 12-47-53 governs the "[r]econsideration or reopening of [a]
decision or order" and states, in relevant part, the following: 
(continued...)
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1993).7 HRS § 386-87(d) states, in pertinent part, that "the
 
[LIRAB] may, upon the application of the director or any other
 
party . . . reopen the matter and thereupon may take further
 evidence or may modify its findings, conclusions or decisions." 
The term "may" signals discretion on the part of the LIRAB, and
 thus Custino's Motion for Reconsideration is reviewed under an
 abuse of discretion standard. See Bocalbos, 93 Hawai
'i at 126, 
997 P.2d at 52. 
As stated above, the purpose of a motion for
 
reconsideration is not "to relitigate old matters," but rather
 generally "is to allow the parties to present new evidence and/or
 arguments that could not have been presented" in an earlier
 proceeding. See Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at 114, 839 P.2d at 27
 
(citations omitted); Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of Pac., Inc., 73 Haw.
 
6(...continued)
(a) In the absence of an appeal and within
thirty days after mailing of a copy of the board's
decision or order, the board may, upon the request of
any party, or upon its own motion, reconsider or
reopen the matter. If reopening is allowed, the board
may take further evidence or may modify its decision
or order. The time to initiate judicial review shall
run from the date of mailing of the further decision
if the matter has been reconsidered or reopened. If
the request for reconsideration or reopening is
denied, the time to initiate judicial review shall run
from the date of mailing the denial decision.
(b) The request for reconsideration or reopening
shall be in writing and shall be served upon all
parties. The request shall specify the reasons why
reconsideration or reopening is warranted.
(c) A hearing on the request for reconsideration
or reopening may be held at the board's discretion.
 
7 HRS § 386-87(d) states the following:
 
§ 386-87 Appeals to appellate board.
. . . . 
(d) In the absence of an appeal and within
thirty days after mailing of a certified copy of the
appellate board's decision or order, the appellate
board may, upon the application of the director or any
other party, or upon its own motion, reopen the matter
and thereupon may take further evidence or may modify
its findings, conclusions or decisions. The time to
initiate judicial review shall run from the date of
mailing of the further decision if the matter has been
reopened. If the application for reopening is denied,
the time to initiate judicial review shall run from
the date of mailing of the denial decision.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
276, 287 n.7, 831 P.2d 1335, 1342 n.7 (1992). However, as 
demonstrated in the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) decision 
in Bocalbos, there is another circumstance in which a motion for 
reconsideration potentially should be granted in workers' compensation cases: when there has been a shift in the focus of the trial, and the evidence in the motion for reconsideration specifically addresses this new focus. See Bocalbos, 93 Hawai
'i 
at 126-27, 997 P.2d at 52-53. 
In Bocalbos, the LIRAB initially approved the
 
claimant's requested medical treatment in its Decision and Order. 
Id. at 123, 997 P.2d at 49. However, in response to the
 employer's motion for reconsideration, the LIRAB amended its
 decision to exclude orthodontic, orthopedic, and prosthodontic
 treatments from the work-related and compensable
 temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condition on the basis that those
 
treatments were unrelated to the TMJ disorder. Id. Bocalbos
 
filed a motion for reconsideration, but the LIRAB rejected this
 
motion; Bocalbos then filed a motion to reopen the case to take
 further evidence, but (again) the LIRAB issued a denial, doing so
 without any explanation. Id. The evidence that Bocalbos sought
 
to admit included various letters related to the LIRAB's change
 in evidentiary focus, and it drew connections between the
 disallowed treatments (orthodontic, orthopedic, and
 prosthodontic) and the TMJ disorder. Id. at 125-29, 997 P.2d at
 
51-55. Bocalbos subsequently appealed to the ICA. Id. at 123,
 
997 P.2d at 49.
 
The ICA held that the LIRAB abused its discretion in
 
denying the motion, basing its ruling, in part at least, on the
 fact that the LIRAB offered no "reasonable articulation for its
 refusal" to consider Bocalbos's further evidence regarding the
 connection between the disallowed treatments and the TMJ
 disorder. Id. at 127, 997 P.2d at 53. It stated that "[t]here
 
is no cogent explanation for the Board's failure to consider
 [this evidence] in light of [its] direct effect on the
 correctness of the Board's finding and conclusion." Id. at 126,

997 P.2d at 52. The court's decision also noted the "change in
 
the Board's focus of the evidence," stemming from its denial of
 the various treatments that it had initially approved. Id. at
 
126-27, 997 P.2d at 52-53. Therefore, Bocalbos provides that
 when there has been a LIRAB-induced shift in the focus of a
 trial, and when the evidence in a reconsideration motion
 specifically addresses this new focus and has a "direct effect on
 the correctness" of a LIRAB decision, then the LIRAB should at
 least afford consideration of that evidence, particularly "[i]n
 the absence of any reasonable articulation for its refusal." See
 
id. 
Turning to the present case, it appears that there was
 
a change in the focus of the trial induced by the LIRAB. This is
 because, initially, the case was focused on whether Custino was
 entitled to PTD or PPD after the closure of the second vocational
 rehabilitation session on October 27, 2005. However, the LIRAB
 
then issued its Decision and Order holding that a determination
 
regarding permanent disability was premature. This shifted the
 focus from permanent disability after October 27, 2005 to that
 regarding Custino's entitlement to TTD for that period. 
Furthermore, the evidence in Custino's Motion for Reconsideration
 (in the form of disability certificates signed by Dr. Kimura)
 specifically addressed the issue of TTD benefits and had a
 "direct effect on the correctness" of the LIRAB's decision as to
 which time periods Custino was actually entitled to TTD benefits. 
The LIRAB also failed to articulate any reason for its refusal to
 consider the evidence proffered by Custino in the Motion for
 Reconsideration, which lends further credence to the notion that
 this situation parallels that of Bocalbos and that there was in
 fact an abuse of discretion by the LIRAB.
 
Additionally, the "equities of the situation" were
 
affected by the fact that the disability certifications were all
 contemporaneously written by Dr. Kimura (there was no retroactive
 certification after the fact), Custino had timely provided these
 certificates to his employer, the DOT, on a regular basis, and
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Custino had received TTD benefits from DOT based on those
 
certificates. The lack of these certificates in the LIRAB's
 record was a technical deficiency, which was not anticipated to
 be an issue under the circumstances of this case. This
 conclusion is also in line with the "humanitarian nature" of the
 workers' compensation act because it allows Custino credit for
 TTD benefits that he had already properly received based on the
 certifications provided to his employer and otherwise would have
 been awarded had the certificates been included in the LIRAB's
 initial record. See Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co.,
 
53 Haw. 406, 409, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972). 
Although the LIRAB's July 21, 2008 Pretrial Order
 
stated that one of the issues to be determined was "the period of
 temporary total disability resulting from the work injury of July
 11, 2002," the other two issues concerned PTD and PPD, and the
 Director's Amended Decision had already determined that Custino
 was permanently disabled "as of 10/28/2005." Thus, the issue on
 appeal in front of the LIRAB appeared to be whether this
 permanent disability was "total" or "partial"; instead, however,
 the LIRAB held that a determination regarding permanent
 disability was altogether premature. This ruling was surprising
 to Custino due to the fact that Custino had already had closure
 of his second vocational rehabilitation period due to the
 infeasibility of him finding suitable, gainful employment. 
Finally, the DOT argues that the Pretrial Order's 
medical reports submission deadline of March 10, 2009 prohibited Custino from offering additional medical evidence beyond that deadline. The Bocalbos court dismissed a similar argument in that case, saying that this was not "relevant to Bocalbos's request to the Board to take further evidence or to modify its findings, conclusions or decisions as allowed by HRS § 386-87(d)." Bocalbos, 93 Hawai
'i at 127 n.27, 997 P.2d at 53 
n.27 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted; emphasis in
 original). Accordingly, the LIRAB's refusal to consider the
 evidence that Custino proffered in his Motion for
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Reconsideration, and to amend its Decision and Order based on
 
that evidence, was an abuse of discretion; however, it was only
 error as to the disability certificates for the periods after
 October 27, 2005 because the LIRAB's shift in focus only
 pertained to the period after that date.
VI. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate in part and remand
 
for further proceedings, with instructions that the LIRAB
 
consider the disability certificates for the periods after
 October 27, 2005, and we affirm the remainder of the LIRAB's 
May 12, 2011 Decision and Order.
