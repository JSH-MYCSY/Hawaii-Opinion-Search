TEVITA UNGOUNGA, also known as Terita Ungounga, David Ungounga,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By:

relating to his failure to pay general excise tax due in tax 
years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 and three counts of False and 
Fraudulent Statements, in violation of HRS ยง 231-36(a) (2001), 
relating to his failure to truthfully and correctly report 
adjusted gross income on his State of Hawai' i income tax returns 
for tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006.

On appeal, Ungounga contends there was insufficient
 
evidence to support his convictions.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Ungounga's points of error as follows:
 
(1) "[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite 
state of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, '[w]e have 
consistently held that . . . proof by circumstantial evidence and 
reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the 
[defendant's conduct] is sufficient. . . . Thus, the mind of an 
alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and 
inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances.'" State v. 
Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (quoting 
State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai' i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 (1997)). 
When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable 
to the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 
166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), there was substantial evidence that

Ungounga acted wilfully  in an attempt to evade or defeat paying
all general excise taxes due for tax years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Ungounga admitted that his gross income was $275,000 for 
2004, was $488,700 for 2005, was $191,450 for 2006, and was 
$182,592 for 2007. Ungounga also admitted that he knew he had to 
file general excise tax returns and pay general excise tax on his 
total gross income. Ungounga applied for and received a general 
excise tax number in 1997. For general excise tax payment 
purposes, Ungounga only reported gross income of $49,100 for 
2004, $135,150 for 2005, zero for 2006, and zero for 2007. In 
Ungounga's state income tax returns, he did not report any gross 
receipts for 2004, reported gross receipts of $145,000 for 2005, 
and $120,000 in gross receipts for 2006. Ungounga did not file a 
State of Hawai' i individual income tax return for 2007.

 HRS ยง 231-40 (Supp. 2012) defines "wilfully" as "a voluntary,
intentional violation of a known legal duty." See State v. Souza, 119 Hawai' i 
60, 68-69, 193 P.3d 1260, 1268-69 (App. 2008).

There was also evidence that Ungounga cashed checks 
from customers instead of depositing them into his business or 
personal accounts and that cashed checks did not appear on any 
bank statements. The Circuit Court found that Ungounga's 
testimony that the State of Hawai' i, Department of Taxation 
stopped him from filing his returns was not credible. "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues 
dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the 
evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. 
Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted; block 
quote format changed). 
Based upon Ungounga's acts and all reasonable
 
inferences from the circumstances, there was sufficient evidence
 
for a trier of fact to conclude that Ungounga acted wilfully to
 
evade or defeat paying some or all general excise taxes due for
 
tax years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.
 
(2) When the evidence is viewed in the light most 
favorable to the prosecution, Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 157-58, 
166 P.3d at 330-31, there was substantial evidence that Ungounga wilfully made statements in his 2004, 2005, and 2006 tax returns 
that he did not believe to be true and correct in every material 
matter, specifically, reporting of his adjusted gross income. As 
specified above, Ungounga's gross income was significantly more 
than he reported on either his general excise tax returns or 
state income tax returns. Despite working with accountants in 
2004 who asked Ungounga for receipts, documentation, and business 
records, Ungounga did not keep any records. Instead, he cashed 
checks that were not reflected in any bank statements. At trial 
Ungounga admitted that his gross income was far in excess of what 
was reported in his individual tax returns for 2004, 2005, and 
2006 and admitted that he signed his tax returns for 2004, 2005, 
and 2006 which certified that the tax return was true and correct 
to the best of his knowledge and made in good faith.

Based upon the Ungounga's acts and all reasonable
 
inferences from the circumstances, there was sufficient evidence
 
for a trier of fact to conclude that Ungounga acted wilfully when
 
he made statements in his 2004, 2005, and 2006 tax returns that
 
he did not believe to be true and correct as to every material
 
matter.
