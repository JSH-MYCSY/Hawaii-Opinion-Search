APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-M NO. 09-1-0078)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL AS MOOT
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of "Amr Elsayed Ayad's Motion to
 
Dismiss" (Motion to Dismiss), filed by Defendant-Appellee Amr
 
Elsayed Ayad (Ayad) on July 7, 2012, the papers in support and in
 opposition, and the records and files herein, it appears that on
 August 3, 2011, Plaintiff-Appellant Meggan Marie Ayad, now known
 as Meggan Marie Pharmer, (Pharmer) filed a Notice of Appeal,
 giving notice of her appeal from the Family Court of the Second
 Circuit's (family court's) "Order Vacating Order on Petition for
 Name Change for Minor Child Filed May 20, 2009, Filed August 12,
 2009," filed on June 27, 2011; and "Order Denying [Pharmer's]
 Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Vacating Order on
 Petition for Name Change of Minor Filed May 20, 2009, Filed
 August 12, 2009," filed on July 20, 2011.

On October 13, 2011, Pharmer filed "[Pharmer's
 
Jurisdictional Statement." On March 8, 2012, she filed an
 
Opening Brief. 
On March 17, 2012, while the appeal was still pending,
 
Pharmer died. On May 22, 2012, the family court filed an "Order
 Granting in Part and Denying in Part [Ayad's] Motion and
 Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief" (Order Awarding Ayad Full
 Custody), in which the court, inter alia, awarded Ayad sole legal
 and physical custody of Child. On July 7, 2012, Ayad filed the
 instant Motion to Dismiss, in which he moves to dismiss the
 appeal as moot. 
Given Pharmer's death and the Order Awarding Ayad Full 
Custody, "the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal -- adverse interest and effective remedy -- have been compromised." Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai' i 1, 
5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). No exception to the mootness doctrine applies. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to
 
Dismiss is granted. This appeal is dismissed as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 12, 2012.
