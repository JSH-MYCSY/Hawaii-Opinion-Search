MEW GUNN YIM, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
GEOFFREY M.S. PANG; ROSITA W. C. WONG;
and ROWEN N. YOUNG, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0232)
 
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT-APPELLEE ROSITA W.C.
 
WONG'S JANUARY 3, 2012 MOTION TO CORRECT ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellee Rosita W.C. Wong's January 3, 2012
 
motion to correct the December 28, 2011 Order Dismissing Appeal
 
for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction is granted. 
The December 28,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2011 Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction
 
incorrectly states that Plaintiff-Appellant Mew Gunn Yim
 (Appellant Yim) asserted an appeal from the Honorable Rhonda A.
 Nishimura's "July 11, 2011 'Order Granting Geoffrey Pang's Motion
 to Dismiss Mew Gunn Yim's Complaint Filed on February 1, 2010,
 Filed on April 11, 2011[,] and Defendant Rowen N. Young's Joinder
 in Defendant Geoffrey Pan's Motion to Dismiss Mew Gunn Yim's
 Complaint Filed on February 1, 2010, Filed April 11, 2011, Filed
 on May 23, 2011' (the July 11, 2011 order)[.]" Thereafter, the
 December 28, 2011 Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate
 Jurisdiction incorrectly refers to the appealed order as "the
 July 11, 2011 order[.]" The December 28, 2011 Order Dismissing
 Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction also incorrectly refers
 to the dismissal of appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000590
 instead of the correct appellate court case number, namely
 appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000589.
 
Therefore, the December 28, 2011 Order Dismissing
 
Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction is hereby corrected so
 that it initially states that Appellant Yim asserted an appeal
 from 
the Honorable Rhoda A. Nishimura's July 7, 2011
"Order Granting Defendant Rosita W.C. Wong's
Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter
Jurisdiction Filed April 7, 2011[,] and
Defendant Rowen N. Young's Joinder Filed May 23,
2011[,] in Defendant Rosita W.C. Wong's Motion
to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter
Jurisdiction Filed April 7, 2011" (the July 7,
2011 order)
 
All subsequent references to the appealed order are corrected to
 
refer to the appealed order as
 
the July 7, 2011 order
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
All referenced to appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000590 are
 
corrected to refer to the appellate court case number as
 
CAAP-11-0000589
 
This court will enter an amended order dismissing
 
appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction that incorporates these
 corrections.
