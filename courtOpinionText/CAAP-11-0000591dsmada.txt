NO. CAAP-11-0000591
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JAMES J. PAPPAS, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHAD DURAN and JONNAVEN MONALIM, Defendants-Appellants,
and
 
MILES KIMHAN, Defendant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1606)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Defendants-Appellants Chad Duran
 
(Appellant Duran) and Jonnaven Monalim's (Appellant Monalim)
 
appeal from the Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's July 6, 2011
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal 
because the July 6, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to case upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
A judgment that does not specifically identify the claim or 
claims on which it enters judgment requires an appellate court to search the often voluminous record on appeal in order to determine the specific claim or claims on which judgment is entered. As the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained, "we 
should not make such searches necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although Plaintiff-Appellee James J. Pappas's (Appellee
 
Pappas) complaint asserted two separate and distinct counts
 against Appellant Duran, Appellant Monalim and Defendant-Appellee
 Miles Kimhan (Appellee Kimhan), the July 6, 2011 judgment does
 not specify the count or counts on which the circuit court
 intends to enter judgment. Consequently, the July 6, 2011
 judgment fails to sufficiently identify the claim or claims on
 which the circuit court intends to enter judgment in this
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
multiple-claim case. Furthermore, although the July 6, 2011
 
judgment purports to be "a [f]inal [j]udgment disposing of all
 remaining parties and issues in this [a]ction[,]" the July 6,
 2011 judgment does not expressly enter judgment on, or dismiss,
 Appellee Pappas's complaint as to Appellee Kimhan. Therefore,
 the July 6, 2011 judgment does not resolve all claims against all
 parties in this case, as HRCP Rule 58 requires for an appealable
 judgment under the holding in Jenkins.
 
Absent the entry of an appealable final judgment, this
 
appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000591. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED this appeal is dismissed for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction.
