ERWIN E. FAGARAGAN, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(SPP NO. 11-1-0005(1) (CR NOS. 04-1-0595(1) & 05-1-0090(1))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Erwin E. Fagaragan (Fagaragan) 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" (Order Denying Petition) filed on July 18, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 Fagaragan argues that the 
Hawai'i Paroling Authority (HPA) acted arbitrarily and 
capriciously and violated his constitutional rights in setting his minimum terms of imprisonment in two separate cases, Criminal No. 04-1-0595(1) and Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1). We affirm. 
I.
 
In his underlying criminal cases, Fagaragan was
 
convicted in Criminal No. 04-1-0595(1) of: (1) promoting a

dangerous drug in the first degree (Promoting Dangerous Drug I);
 
(2) unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle (UCPV); (3)
 prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia (Prohibited Drug
 Paraphernalia); and (4) promoting a detrimental drug in the third
 degree (Promoting Detrimental Drug III). The charges in Criminal
 No. 04-1-0595(1) stemmed from a police officer's arrest of
 Fagaragan after he was seen driving a stolen vehicle. Fagaragan
 was found to be in possession of over thirty-three grams of
 methamphetamine in several packets, scales, glass pipes, empty
 plastic packets, marijuana, and $1,474. On January 11, 2006, the
 Circuit Court sentenced Fagaragan on each offense to the maximum
 indeterminate term of imprisonment: twenty years for Promoting
 Dangerous Drug I, five years each for UCPV and Prohibited Drug
 Paraphernalia, and thirty days for Promoting Detrimental Drug
 III. All terms were imposed to run concurrently. 
In Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1), Fagaragan was convicted
 
of: (1) Promoting Dangerous Drug I; (2) Attempted Promoting
 Dangerous Drug I; and (3) Prohibited Drug Paraphernalia. The
 charges arose after Fagaragan was arrested on an outstanding
 bench warrant. The police found thirty-four packets containing a
 total of 154.9 grams of methamphetamine, a glass smoking pipe,
 and a digital scale in Fagaragan's car and $8,649 in cash in
 Fagaragan's pockets. On April, 19, 2006, the Circuit Court
 sentenced Fagaragan on each offense to the maximum indeterminate
 term of imprisonment: twenty years each for Promoting Dangerous
 Drug I and Attempted Promoting Dangerous Drug I and five years
 for Prohibited Drug Paraphernalia. The Circuit Court ran these
 sentences concurrently with each other and with the sentences
 imposed in Criminal No. 04-1-0595(1).
 
On May 21, 2007, the HPA issued its order fixing the
 
minimum terms of imprisonment on his felony convictions in both
 Criminal No. 04-1-0595(1) and Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1). The HPA
 set the minimum term of imprisonment for each felony conviction
 at the statutory maximum term of imprisonment: twenty years each
 for the two Promoting Dangerous Drug I convictions and the
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Attempted Promotion Dangerous Drug I conviction and five years
 
each for the two Prohibited Drug Paraphernalia convictions and
 the UCPV conviction. The HPA's order states that the level of
 punishment is "Level III" and describes the significant factors
 in identifying the level of punishment as "Nature of Offense."
 
Fagaragan filed direct appeals of his judgments in both 
Criminal Nos. 04-1-0595(1) and 05-1-0090(1). This court affirmed the Circuit Court's judgment in Criminal No. 04-1-0595(1) by summary disposition order filed on September 27, 2007. State v. 
Fagaragan, No. 27873, 2007 WL 2834214 (Hawai' i App. September 27, 
2007) (SDO). In Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1), this court issued an opinion on September 10, 2007, which reversed Fagaragan's conviction for Attempted Promoting Dangerous Drug I, but affirmed the Circuit Court's judgment on the remaining convictions. State 
v. Fagaragan, 115 Hawai' i 364, 167 P.3d 739 (App. 2007).
 After this court reversed Fagaragan's Attempted
 
Promoting Dangerous Drug I conviction in Criminal No. 05-1­0090(1), the HPA held a new hearing to reset the minimum terms on
 Fagaragan's convictions in Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1). On April
 26, 2008, the HPA issued its order again fixing the minimum terms
 of imprisonment on each of Fagaragan's remaining convictions in
 Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1) at the statutory maximum term of
 imprisonment: twenty years for the Promoting Dangerous Drug I
 conviction and five years for the Prohibited Drug Paraphernalia
 conviction. The HPA's order again states that the level of
 punishment as "Level III" and describes the significant factors
 in identifying the level of punishment as "Nature of Offense."
 The HPA's order appears to have been served on Fagaragan by mail
 on May 5, 2008.
 
On June 18, 2008, Fagaragan filed a petition for post-
conviction relief in S.P.P. No. 08-1-0009 (Prior Petition). In
 the Prior Petition, Fagaragan challenged his convictions and
 sentences in Criminal No. 05-1-0090(1), but did not challenge the
 HPA's fixing of the minimum terms of imprisonment on his
 convictions in Criminal No. 04-1-0595(1) or Criminal No. 05-1­

0090(1). On June 25, 2008, the Circuit Court issued an order 
denying Fagaragan's Prior Petition without a hearing. Fagaragan appealed, and by summary disposition order issued on August 26, 2009, this court affirmed the Circuit Court. Fagaragan v. State, 
No. 29281, 2009 WL 2608463 (Hawai' i App. Aug. 26, 2009) (SDO). 
On May 11, 2011, Fagaragan filed the instant "Petition 
for Post-Conviction Relief" (Petition), pursuant to Hawai' i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (2006). The Circuit Court denied the Petition without a hearing and issued the Order Denying Petition. On appeal, Fagaragan argues that the Circuit Court erred in denying his Petition because: (1) the HPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously (a) in setting his level of punishment at a Level III and (b) in fixing his minimum terms of incarceration for his drug offenses at the maximum statutory terms of imprisonment on that basis; and (2) the HPA's actions violated his constitutional rights.

II.
 
We resolve the arguments Fagaragan raises on appeal as
 
follows. 
1. We conclude that Fagaragan waived all the issues 
he raises in his Petition. Fagaragan filed his Prior Petition
 pursuant to HRPP Rule 40, in which he could have, but did not,
 challenge the HPA's fixing of the minimum terms of imprisonment
 on his convictions. Fagaragan has not shown any extraordinary
 
circumstances to justify his failure to previously raise the
 
issues he asserts in the instant Petition. Accordingly,
 Fagaragan waived the issues presented in his Petition, and the
 Circuit Court properly denied his Petition without a hearing. 
See HRPP Rule 40 (a)(3). 
2 The only minimum terms of incarceration that have not already expired
are the twenty-year minimum terms that the HPA set on Fagaragan's Promoting
Dangerous Drug I convictions. The five-year minimum terms set on Fagaragan's
other convictions expired before he filed his Petition in this case.
Accordingly, we only address the minimum terms that the HPA set on Fagaragan's
Promoting Dangerous Drug I convictions.

2. In any event, we conclude that Fagaragan's
 
arguments on appeal lack merit and that the Circuit Court did not 
err in denying his Petition without a hearing. The HPA's "Guidelines for Establishing Minimum Terms of Imprisonment" (Guidelines) include under the criteria "Nature of Offense" for a Level III level of punishment that "[t]he offense involved the manufacture, importation, distribution, or cultivation of substantial quantities of drugs." Fagaragan's Promoting Dangerous Drug I convictions fit this description. There is support in the record for the HPA's determination that under its Guidelines, Fagaragan fell within a Level III level of punishment with respect to his Promoting Dangerous Drug I convictions based on the criteria of "Nature of Offense." Accordingly, we cannot say that the HPA acted arbitrarily or capriciously in setting Fagaragan's minimum terms on these offenses. See Williamson v. 
Hawai'i Paroling Authority, 97 Hawai' i 183, 188-96, 35 P.3d 210, 
215-23 (2001) (holding that the HPA has the authority to set a prisoner's minimum term of imprisonment at a period equal to the statutory maximum term of incarceration). We also conclude that Fagaragan failed to show a colorable claim that the HPA's actions violated his constitutional rights. See Dan v. State, 76 Hawai' i 
423, 427, 879 P.2 528, 532 (1994).

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the July 18, 2011,
 
Order Denying Petition of the Circuit Court.
