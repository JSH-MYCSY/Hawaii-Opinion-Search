APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2496)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
I. BACKGROUND
 In this class action suit, Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-
Appellee Jason Kawakami, individually and on behalf of all others
 
similarly situated,1/
 claims that Defendant-Appellee/Cross-
Appellant Kahala Hotel Investors, LLC dba The Kahala Hotel &
 Resort ("Kahala Hotel") collected a percent-based service charge
 from its customers without properly disclosing the hotel's
 practice of distributing less than 100% of that charge to its
 employees as "tip income," in violation of disclosure provisions
 set forth in Hawaii Revised Statute ("HRS") § 481B–14 (2008). 
We address this case on remand from the Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court, which, in Kawakami v. Kahala Hotel Investors, LLC, 134 Hawai
'i 352, 431 P.3d 558 (2014) ("Kawakami II"), vacated this 
court's decision in Kawakami v. Kahala Hotel Investors, LLC, No. CAAP-11-0000594, 2014 WL 1237539 (Hawai
'i App. Mar. 25, 2014) 
("Kawakami I") and held that HRS § 481B-14 required Kahala Hotel 
1/

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to disclose to Kawakami its practice of reclassifying the 
"management share" of service charges to pay for its employee's wages, which are not "tip income." The Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
remanded for this court to consider Kawakami's remaining points of error. 
The facts of the case are set out in Kawakami II, 134 
Hawai
'i at 354–56, 431 P.3d at 560–62. We consider Kawakami's 
assertions that the Circuit Court2/ erred when it: (A) negated 
the jury's verdict by granting Kahala Hotel's motion for judgment as a matter of law ("JMOL"); and (B) denied Kawakami's motion in limine no. 1, thereby allowing the jury to consider evidence of what Kahala Hotel did with the "management share" of service charges it retained. We affirm. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
We review the Circuit Court's grant of Kahala Hotel's 
motion for JMOL de novo and thus apply the same standard as the 
trial court. Aluminum Shake Roofing, Inc. v. Hirayasu, 110 
Hawai
'i 248, 251, 131 P.3d 1230, 1233 (2006) (quoting Miyamoto v. 
Lum, 104 Hawai 'i 1, 6–7, 84 P.3d 509, 514–15 (2004)). "A motion 
for [JMOL] may be granted only when[,] after disregarding conflicting evidence . . . and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in the non-moving party's favor, it can be said that there is no evidence to support a jury verdict in his or her favor." Ray v. Kapiolani 
Med. Specialists, 125 Hawai
'i 253, 262, 259 P.3d 569, 578 (2011) 
(original brackets omitted) (quoting Miyamoto, 104 Hawai 'i at 7, 
84 P.3d at 515) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Kahala Hotel's Motion for JMOL
 
In support of his first point of error, Kawakami argues
 
that he was "injured by a deceptive practice, and [is therefore]
 entitled to recover damages, where [Kahala Hotel's deceptive
 nondisclosure practices] caused [Kawakami] to pay money for
 something other than what he . . . bargained for," and that the
 
2/

2
  
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
jury correctly calculated damages based on his expected "benefit
 
of the bargain." Kahala Hotel responds that Kawakami failed to
 present evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements of a claim
 for relief under HRS § 480–13 (Supp. 2006), which, Kahala Hotel
 argues, requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that they have
 sustained some type of economic loss in order to demonstrate
 "injury." We conclude that the Circuit Court's JMOL in favor of
 Kahala Hotel was proper because, although Kahala Hotel violated
 HRS § 480–2 (Supp. 2006), Kawakami failed to establish that he
 was injured, financially or otherwise, as a result of Kahala
 Hotel's deceptive trade practices, and he therefore failed to
 establish damages as required by HRS § 480–13(b)(1). 
Accordingly, we affirm the JMOL. 
The prerequisites for bringing an action based on 
practices made unlawful by HRS § 480–2(a) are set forth in HRS § 480–13. The applicable HRS § 480–13 provision depends, however, on whether the plaintiff alleges that the defendant engaged in unfair methods of competition ("UMOC") or unfair or deceptive acts or practices ("UDAP"). See Haw. Med. Ass'n v. 
Haw. Med Serv. Ass'n, 113 Hawai
'i 77, 109, 148 P.3d 1179, 1211 
(2006) [hereinafter "HMA"] (quoting Star Markets, Ltd. v. Texaco, Inc., 945 F. Supp. 1344, 1346 (D. Haw. 1996) (citations omitted)).
3/ Here, Kawakami does not allege that Kahala Hotel's 
actions constituted UMOC so as to bring the instant action within HRS §§ 480–2(e) and 480–13(a).
4/ See Rodriguez v. Starwood 
3/
 The Circuit Court failed to distinguish between the tests for UMOC
and UDAP claims in this case and analyzed the JMOL motion based on the UMOC
test's injury to business or property language, as set forth in §480–13(a):
 
In order for Plaintiffs to recover any relief under
 
Chapter 480, they must establish three elements, which
includes proof that Defendant Kahala Hotel's violation caused
an injury to Plaintiff's business or property. In other
 words, Plaintiffs must prove that they sustained or suffered
 
financial or economic loss or harm.
 
The implications of this error are discussed more fully, infra.
 
4/
 Although the Complaint states that Kahala Hotel's service charge
practice "constitutes unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct ofa trade or commerce and/or unfair methods of competition," the record revealsno allegations involving competition or any other aspect of an antitrust
injury, as required to recover for UMOC. See Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel, 
Ltd., 122 Hawai' i 423, 440, 228 P.3d 303, 320 (2010) ("to gain standing to sue

Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., Cv. No. 09-00016 DAE-LEK, 2010
 
WL 8938524, at *18 (D. Haw. Dec. 29, 2010) ("[T]o satisfy the
 second element [of a UMOC claim] under § 480–13[(a)], a plaintiff
 must allege injury in fact [to business or property] and the
 'nature of the competition.'"); accord Gurrobat v. HTH Corp.  , 133
 
Hawai
'i 1, 23, 323 P.3d 792, 814 (2014). Therefore, we analyze 
the instant dispute in light of Hawai 'i's UDAP provisions: HRS 
§§ 480–2(d)5/	  and 480–13(b). 6/
  See Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127
 
Hawai'i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (citing In 
re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai 'i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 
727 (2007)). To maintain a private cause of action for UDAP
 under HRS § 480–2(d), and to "obtain [monetary] relief under
 section 480–13(b)(1), a consumer[-plaintiff] must establish
 three
[7/] elements: '(1) a violation of section 480–2; (2) injury
 
for UMOC under HRS § 480-2(3), a private plaintiff must separately allege the
nature of the competition"); HMA, 113 Hawai' i at 114 n.30, 148 P.3d at 1216
n.30 (quoting Robert's Haw. Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91Hawai'i 224, 254 n.31, 982 P.2d 853, 883 n.31 (1999), superseded by statutue,
2002 Haw. Sess. L. Act 229, § 2 at 916–17, as recognized in Four Seasons Hotel, 122 Hawai' i at 427 n.8, 228 P.3d at 307 n.8). 
5/
 HRS § 480–2(d) establishes that "[n]o person other than a
consumer, the attorney general or the director of the office of consumer
protection may bring an action based upon [UDAP] declared unlawful by this
section." Here, it is undisputed that Kawakami and the rest of the plaintiff
class were "consumers" within the meaning of HRS chapter 480.
 
6/
 HRS § 480–13(b) sets forth the forms of recovery available to
plaintiffs alleging UDAP under HRS § 480–2(d) and states:
 
(b) Any consumer who is injured by any unfair or
deceptive act or practice forbidden or declared unlawful by
section 480–2:
 
(1)	 May sue for damages sustained by the consumer,
and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the
plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less than
$1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff
sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and
reasonable attorney's fees together with the
costs of suit . . . ; and
 
(2)	 May bring proceedings to enjoin the unlawful
practices, and if the decree is for the
 plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded
 reasonable attorney's fees together with the
costs of suit.
 
7/
 A handful of Hawai' i cases discussing HRS § 480–13(b) appear to
require proof of only two elements to pursue recovery under the statute: that
plaintiff is (1) a consumer, who (2) was injured. E.g., Four Seasons Hotel,
122 Hawai' i at 442, 228 P.3d at 322 (citing Flores v. Rawlings Co., 117 Hawai' i 
153, 162, 177 P.3d 341, 350 (2008)). However, these two elements are 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to the consumer caused by such a violation; and (3) proof of the 
amount of damages.'" Compton v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 761 F.3d 1046, 1053 (9th Cir. 2014) (emphasis and footnote added) (quoting Davis v. Wholesale Motors, Inc., 86 Hawai
'i 405, 417, 949 P.2d 
1026, 1038 (App. 1997)) (original brackets omitted). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court's holding that "Kahala Hotel 
failed to comply with HRS § 481B–14[,]" Kawakami II, 134 Hawai 'i 
at 360, 341 P.3d at 566, establishes that the transactions at issue in this case violate HRS § 480–2(a). See Haw. Rev. Stat. 
§ 481B–4; Four Seasons Hotel, 122 Hawai
'i at 427, 228 P.3d at 
307. Kawakami has therefore satisfied the first element required
 to recover damages for UDAP under HRS § 480–13(b)(1). 
Accordingly, the remainder of our discussion of Kawakami's first
 point of error focuses on the final two HRS § 480–13(b) elements:
 (2) injury caused by the violation, and (3) proof of damages.
 
1. UDAP Injury
 
Kawakami argues that he established an injury caused by
 
Kahala Hotel's § 480–2(a) violation because, with regard to HRS
 § 481B–14, "[i]t is clear that the legislature believed that
 consumers are negatively impacted—injured–when they are misled
 about how their service charge payment is applied." 
Kahala Hotel
 
responds by insisting that recovery under HRS § 480–13 requires
 "an injury in the form of economic loss or harm." We hold that
 the "injury" consumers must prove to recover monetary damages in
 an action involving HRS §§ 481B–14, 480–2(a)&(d), and
 480–13(b)(1) need not be strictly "economic" in nature, but UDAP
 consumer-plaintiffs must still establish that the defendant's
 unlawful conduct caused them to suffer a private injury-in-fact
 beyond merely being deceived. And, based on our discussion
 below, we hold that Kawakami has failed to demonstrate injury.
 
As a threshold matter, we reject Kawakami's suggestion
 
practically applied to determine whether a plaintiff has standing to bring the 
§ 480–2(d) claim. E.g., Flores, 117 Hawai' i at 162, 177 P.3d at 350; cf. 
Robert's Haw., 91 Hawai' i at 254, 982 P.2d at 883 (stating the three-part UMOC
test for recovery under § 480–13(a) as a test plaintiffs must meet "in order to have standing to bring a claim for relief" under the statute (emphasis
added)). It follows, then, that the three-part, violation-plus-injury-plus­damages test applies to determine whether plaintiffs with standing under HRS
§ 480–2(d) can recover damages under § 480–13(b)(1). 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that Kahala Hotel's violation of HRS § 481B–14 is, without more, 
sufficient evidence of "injury" to support the jury's award under HRS § 480–13(b)(1). Robert's Haw., 91 Hawai
'i at 254 n.30, 982 
P.2d at 883 n.30 ("[Although] proof of a violation of chapter 480 is an essential element of an action under HRS § 480–13 . . . , forbidden acts cannot be relevant unless they cause [some] private damage." (quoting Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., 61 Haw. 607, 618, 607 P.2d 1304, 1312 (1980)). Indeed, such a reading would render the second element of the UDAP test superfluous. Next, we note that HRS chapter 480 does not define the term "injury." Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai
'i 309, 
316, 47 P.3d 1222, 1229 (2002) (citing Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480–1). As none of our cases have dealt with injury in this precise context, we look to cases construing "injury" in the UMOC context for guidance. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 1–15(1) (1993). 
In a UMOC action, courts have held that the HRS 
§ 480–13(a) "injured in the person's business or property"­requirement is satisfied where, as a result of the defendant's UMOC: plaintiff-employees "alleged that their tip income has been reduced," Four Seasons Hotel, 122 Hawai
'i at 437, 228 P.3d at 
317; plaintiff-medical association group alleged that it "was required to divert substantial resources and time . . . 'that otherwise would go to support its principal mission in service of its members[,]'" HMA, 113 Hawai
'i at 114, 148 P.3d at 1216; and 
where "plaintiffs allege[d] that injury occurred to personal property through a payment of money wrongfully induced" under a void promissory note, Ai, 61 Haw. at 614, 607 P.2d at 1310 (citing Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979)). 
The "injury" required to recover in a UDAP action, on 
the other hand, is judged by a less stringent standard. Four 
Seasons Hotel, 122 Hawai
'i at 435, 440, 228 P.3d at 315, 320 
(noting that the UMOC plaintiff must make a more specific and detailed showing of "injury" than her UDAP counterpart). For example, courts considering UDAP cases have held that the HRS § 480–13(b) "injured by" requirement is satisfied where, as a result of the defendant's UDAP: consumer–plaintiff "engaged in prolonged negotiations, incurred transaction costs in providing 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and notarizing documents, and endured lengthy delays" in 
attempting to modify her mortgage loan, only to end up in foreclosure, Compton, 761 F.3d at 1057 (denying relief from foreclosure through the UDAP claim on other grounds); and where car shopper-plaintiffs were not misled by defendant's advertisement into making an actual purchase, but they nonetheless expended time (in traveling to the lot, test driving the vehicle, and negotiating with the sales agent) and money (between $3.00-and-$5.00 for gasoline) in their attempt to consummate the purchase, Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawai
'i at 313, 318–19, 
47 P.3d at 1226, 1231–32. By comparing the facts that constitute an "injury" in UMOC actions construing HRS § 480–13(a) with those in UDAP actions construing § 480–13(b), we find that, while UDAP plaintiffs must prove that they have suffered some actual harm or loss as a result of the defendant's UDAP, that harm or loss may be either economic or non-economic in nature.
8/  
Notwithstanding the comparatively low bar Hawaii courts
 
have set for proving the injury element of a UDAP claim, Compton,
 761 F.3d at 1053, Kawakami has failed to establish that he is a
 "consumer who [was] injured by" the negative effects of Kahala
 Hotel's UDAP. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480–13(b). In this case, such a
 non-economic injury could, for example, have taken the form of
 poor-quality service by the staff at Kawakami's wedding
 reception, which would support his contention that Kahala Hotel's
 "deception caused [Kawakami] to pay money for something other
 than what he . . . bargained for." Kawakami makes no such
 argument.
 
Instead, Kawakami's essential argument for benefit-of­
the-bargain damages is premised on Leibert v. Fin. Factors, Ltd,
 71 Haw. 285, 788 P.2d 833 (1990), which held that these types of
 
8/
 This interpretation of HRS § 480–13(b)'s injury requirement is
also supported by the reason and spirit behind HRS § 481B–14, which serves to
protect both employees and consumers who, absent disclosure, are misled "intobelieving the service charges are being used as a gratuity to employees who
provide the services for which consumers believe they are tipping." Kawakami 
II, 134 Hawai' i at 360, 341 P.3d at 566; see Haw. Rev. Stat. § 1-15(2) ("The
reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to
enact it, may be considered to discover its true meaning"). We therefore hold that Kawakami was not required to show "an injury in the form of economic lossor harm" in order to recover. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 1–15(3) ("Every constructionwhich leads to an absurdity shall be rejected."). 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contract damages are generally available under HRS chapter 480 
and should be calculated with reference to "put[ting] the plaintiff [back] in the position he would have been had he not been defrauded." Id. at 290, 788 P.2d at 837 (ellipsis omitted) 
(quoting Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 52, 451 P.2d 814, 820 (1969)). However, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has since clarified 
that benefit-of-the-bargain damages are only available when there has been a breach of contract. Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawai
'i at 319, 
47 P.3d at 1232 (citations omitted) (holding that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover "benefit-of-the-bargain" damages because there was no contract between the parties in that matter). And here, as discussed in part (III)(A)(2), infra, Kawakami has failed to demonstrate that Kahala Hotel breached its event agreement with him. Accordingly, Kawakami's reliance on Liebert is misplaced, and that case does not control here. See State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 399, 219 P.3d 1170, 1186 (2009) ("[F]or 
purposes of stare decisis, the holdings of those cases are limited to the issues that were actually decided by the court, and are not dispositive of the distinct issue presented here." (citing Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1995))). 
Alternatively, Kawakami simply could have alleged that 
Kahala Hotel's UDAP wasted his time. See, e.g., Zanakis-Pico, 98 
Hawai
'i at 313, 318–19, 47 P.3d at 1226, 1231–32. However, the 
evidence Kawakami actually offered below failed to establish that Kahala Hotel's deceptive service charge practices played a role in Kawakami's ultimate decision to hold his event at the hotel, and Kawakami has not alleged that he would have done anything differently if Kahala Hotel had made the requisite HRS § 481B–14 disclosure. See Compton, 761 F.3d at 1053 ("[D]eceptive acts 'do 
their damage when they induce action that a consumer would not otherwise have undertaken,' [so] a consumer who can show 'a resulting injury' is entitled to damages even if the consumer has not actually consummated a particular transaction." (quoting Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawai
'i at 317, 47 P.3d at 1230)). Instead, 
Kawakami testified that: "If I knew prior to my wedding reception that the tip -- the total gratuity that I was paying was not going to the servers, I'm not exactly sure what I would have 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
done, but I know there would have been questions." Moreover, 
Kawakami also confirmed that he "had a wonderful reception at the Kahala Hotel." Therefore, Kawakami's allegation that he was deceived and thus did not receive the benefit of his bargain—without any showing of how Kahala Hotel's deception adversely affected him or the nature of his agreement with Kahala Hotel, whether economically or otherwise—is insufficient to demonstrate a UDAP "injury." See Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawai
'i at 
319, 47 P.3d at 1232 (citations omitted). Accordingly, Kawakami has not satisfied the second UDAP element required to recover under HRS § 480–13(b)(1). 
2. Contract-Based Injury
 
According to Kawakami, "the conclusion that [Kahala 
Hotel] engaged in an unfair and deceptive act in trade or commerce," which the Hawai
'i Supreme Court affirmed in Kawakami 
II, "automatically triggers [HRS §] 480–12 [(Supp. 2006)], which provides that '[a]ny contract or agreement in violation of this chapter is void and is not enforceable at law or in equity.'" Because we find that the required disclosure under HRS § 481B–14 need not take the form of a written provision in an event contract, nor must it necessarily occur before parties enter into the contract, we reject Kawakami's alternative argument that Kahala Hotel breached its contract and thereby caused Kawakami to suffer a contract-based injury merely by the fact that the disclosure was not included in the contract. 
When the form of statutory disclosure is discretionary, 
a contract's failure to include the requisite disclosure does not trigger HRS § 480–12's voidness provision. See 808 Dev., LLC v. 
Murakami, 111 Hawai
'i 349, 357, 141 P.3d 996, 1004 (2006) 
(quoting Jack Endo Elec., Inc. v. Lear Siegler, Inc., 59 Haw. 612, 616–17, 585 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1978)). Contrary to Kawakami's assertions, HRS § 481B–14's disclosure requirement is discretionary insofar as hotels and restaurants may choose between either distributing 100% of the service charge monies collected as "tip income" or retaining some (or all) of the funds 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as long as they "clearly disclose" the practice to consumers.9/
 
See Rodriguez, 2010 WL 8938524, at *10 ("Section 481B–14 . . .
 
creates a minimum standard that ensures employees receive
 gratuity irrespective of whether a hotel or restaurant discloses
 its withholding to its customers." (emphasis added)). Further,
 HRS § 481B–14 does not specify a form that disclosure must take
 in order to be "clear" under the statute. Wadsworth v. KSL Grand
 
Wailea Resort, Inc., Civil No. 08–00527 ACK–RLP, 2014 WL 6065875,
 at *4 (D. Haw. Nov. 12, 2014). As such, Kahala Hotel's failure
 to make a written disclosure in its event agreement with Kawakami
 does not, in and of itself, render its event agreements—or any
 portions thereof—automatically void and unenforceable.
10/   See
 
Flores, 117 Hawai 'i at 169, 177 P.3d at 357 (denying recovery 
where the provision at issue "d[id] not bear on the validity of
 the underlying obligation and involved no illegal representations
 . . . such that payment on the obligation would have caused
 [p]laintiffs to incur private damages"). Thus, because the
 
9/
 Kawakami contends that common law principles require that any
disclosure of this kind should be made at the formation of the contractual
 
relationship. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 551(2) ("[W]hen there is a
duty to disclose material facts in a business transaction, disclosure must be
made before the transaction is consummated."). However, Kawakami has not
offered any case law from this jurisdiction to support the proposition that
such common law principles apply to the instant dispute. Instead, Kawakami
states that, "[w]hen a duty to disclose exists in a business transaction, it
is not satisfied by a disclosure made after the transaction is consummated[,]"
and cites to Bair v. Public Serv. Emps. Credit Union, 709 P.2d 961 (Colo. App.
1985) and Ralson Purina Co. v. McKendrick, 850 S.W.2d 629 (Tex. App. 1993),
each of which provides little support for the point. Moreover, as discussed
in part (III)(A)(1), supra, Kawakami has failed to allege that he relied on—or
even considered—any representation that Kahala Hotel made about its service
charge practices prior to the parties' execution of the event agreement.
 
10/
 Analogous cases applying HRS § 480–12 to void a contract have
usually done so only where the offending party has violated a statute that,
unlike HRS § 481B–14, contains specific contractual requirements. E.g., 808 
Dev., 111 Hawai' i at 357, 141 P.3d at 1004 (holding that a licensed
contractor's failure to make mandatory disclosures under HRS § 444–25.5(a)

underlying event agreement—standing alone—did not violate the
 
law, and because Kawakami has failed to argue that Kahala Hotel's
 service charge practices affected his decision to enter into that
 agreement,
11/ we agree that Kawakami's payment of the sums
 
pursuant to the agreement did not cause Kawakami injury. 
3. UDAP Damages
 
Kawakami's arguments regarding the nature and amount of 
damages he suffered due to Kahala Hotel's UDAP stem from the alternative, contract-based allegations mentioned above. Because the event agreements between Kahala Hotel and members of the plaintiff class cannot have been void and unenforceable simply based on their omission of a non-mandatory disclosure provision—so therefore Kawakami has failed to establish that he was "injured by" Kahala Hotel's nondisclosure—we need not address Kawakami's contract-based arguments further. See Zanakis-Pico, 
98 Hawai
'i at 319, 47 P.3d at 1232 ("The [plaintiffs] may not, 
however, recover 'benefit-of-the-bargain' damages, which are preconditioned on the breach of a contract."). 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the Circuit
 
Court's order granting JMOL in Kahala Hotel's favor.
 
B. Kawakami's Motion in Limine No. 1
 In his second point of error, Kawakami argues that
 
"[t]he trial court erred when it denied Kawakami's motion in
 limine number 1, which sought to preclude evidence concerning the
 manner in which [Kahala Hotel] allocated its service charge after
 it was improperly collected from the members of the Plaintiff
 Class, and instead allowed the jury to consider the evidence to
 show the portion of the service charge that was actually
 distributed to banquet employees as tip income." That is,
 Kawakami asserts that because he was "injured by making the
 [service charge] payment, the only evidence relevant to damages
 is the amount of payment [Kahala Hotel] collected under its
 
11/
 That is, Kawakami does not assert a claim for fraudulent
inducement, which could potentially have entitled him to the type of contract
damages he now seeks. See Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai' i 277, 285 n.6, 172 P.3d 1021, 1029 n.6 (2007) (stating the
elements of a fraudulent inducement claim).

deceptive service clause provision." We disagree.
 
The evidence Kawakami sought to exclude in the motion 
in limine no. 1 was relevant to determining whether or not Kahala 
Hotel's non-disclosure practices violated HRS § 480–2 and was, therefore, admissible. Indeed, considering that the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court has already held, in Kawakami II, 134 Hawai 'i 352, 
431 P.3d 558, that Kahala Hotel's use of its retained portion of the service charges triggers the HRS § 481-14 disclosure requirements, we find that evidence of what Kahala Hotel did with the "management share" was indisputably relevant to demonstrating an HRS § 480–2 violation. See Haw. R. Evid. Rule 401 ("'Relevant 
evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.") As such, we do not disturb the Circuit Court's denial of Kawakami's motion to exclude it.
