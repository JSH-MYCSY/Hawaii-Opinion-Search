APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-1962-08-KKS)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Madeliene Joy Haskins and James
 
Stephens (Appellants) appeal from the July 7, 2011 Final Judgment
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 
1
Court).  Appellants' Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 480-2 claim
 
was dismissed based on the four-year statute of limitations 
in
 
HRS § 480-24 (2008).
 
On appeal, Appellants contend that the Circuit Court
 
erred in granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings because,
 
inter alia
, the statute of limitations was tolled during the
 
pendency of Appellants' federal suit.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Appellants' point of error as follows:
 
Applicable federal law provides:
 
§ 1367 Supplemental jurisdiction.  (a) Except as
provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided
otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which
the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district
courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other
claims that are so related to claims in the action within
 such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same
case or controversy under Article III of the United States
Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include
claims that involve the joinder or intervention of
additional parties.
 
(b) In any civil action of which the district courts
have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of
this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental
jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs
against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by
persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of
such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule
24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction
over such claims would be inconsistent with the
 jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.
 
(c)
 The district courts may decline to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a)
if -­
(1)	 the claim raises a novel or complex issue of
State law,
(2) 	the claim substantially predominates over the
claim or claims over which the district court
 has original jurisdiction,
(3) 	the district court has dismissed all claims over
 which it has original jurisdiction, or
(4) 	in exceptional circumstances, there are other
compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
 
(d) The period of limitations for any claim asserted
under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same
action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or
after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall
 
be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30
days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a
longer tolling period.
 
(e) As used in this section, the term "State" includes
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
and any territory or possession of the United States. 
(Emphasis added.)
 
We conclude that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d), the
 
statute of limitations on Appellants' HRS § 480-2 claim, was
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
tolled pending the dismissal of the federal case and for (at
 
least) 30 days thereafter. See, e.g., Turner v. Kight, 957 A.2d
 
984 (Md. 2008) (noting various interpretations of the tolling
 period, which we need not resolve in this case). We reject the
 
appellees' contention that the statute only applies when a
 
federal court expressly "declines to exercise supplemental
 
jurisdiction" over a state law claim because that interpretation
 
would undermine the clear, remedial purpose of the statute.
 
Appellants filed the instant case within 30 days of the
 
dismissal of the federal case. Hence, the Circuit Court erred
 
when it concluded that Appellants' claim was barred by the
 
statute of limitations set forth in HRS § 480-24. The Circuit
 
Court's July 7, 2011 Final Judgment is vacated and this case is
 
remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.
