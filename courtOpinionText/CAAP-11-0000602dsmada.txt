OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
STATE OF HAWAII, Plaintiff-Appellee v.
MARIA T. TIMMONS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-04522)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Maria T. Timmons's
 
(Appellant) appeal from the Honorable Clyde Sumida's August 2,
 2011 order dismissing without prejudice Plaintiff-Appellee State
 of Hawaii's amended complaint against Appellant for operating a
 vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of HRS
 § 291E-61 (Supp. 2010), because the August 2, 2011 order
 dismissing without prejudice is not appealable pursuant Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-12 (Supp. 2010).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996). 
"Appeals from the district court, in criminal cases, are 
authorized by HRS § 641-12, which . . . provides in pertinent part that appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." Id. (internal quotation marks, emphasis, and brackets 
omitted). "Although interlocutory appeals in criminal matters may be taken to the supreme court from the circuit courts, there is no analogous statute authorizing interlocutory appeals from the district courts in criminal matters." Id. (citations and 
footnote omitted). 
A decision or judgment is final for purposes of appeal
 
“when it terminates the litigation on the merits and leaves
 nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been
 determined.” State v. Valiani, 57 Haw. 133, 134, 552 P.2d 75, 76
 
(1976) (construing HRS § 641-12) (quotation marks and ellipsis
 points omitted). The dismissal of a criminal complaint without
 prejudice is not a decision on the merits, and “a dismissal
 without prejudice is not a final order.” United States v. Tsoie,
 966 F.2d 1357, 1359 (10
th
 Cir. 1992).
In State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 
102 (App. 2005), we concluded that "[j]udgments of conviction entered in the district courts may not be appealed unless they are final. Judgments of conviction are not final unless they include the final adjudication and the final sentence." Id. at 
442, 127 P.3d at 102 (emphasis added). The August 2, 2011 order 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
dismissing without prejudice is not a decision on the merits and
 
does not include a sentence against Appellant. Therefore, the
 August 2, 2011 order dismissing without prejudice is not
 appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-12.
 
Absent an appealable judgment or order under HRS § 641­
12, we lack jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000602. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of jurisdiction.
