IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MARIA T. TIMMONS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-04522)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Maria T. Timmons (Timmons) was
 
charged with operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 
intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2012). Timmons appeals from the Judgment,
 which dismissed her case without prejudice, that was filed on
 August 2, 2011, in the District Court of the First Circuit
 (District Court).
1
 
On appeal, Timmons contends that the District Court
 
erred in dismissing her case without prejudice, instead of with
 prejudice, and in failing to make adequate findings to support
 its dismissal without prejudice. 
Timmons moved to dismiss the case with prejudice,
 
arguing among other things that the speedy-trial time limits set

forth in Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 (2000) 
had been violated. Although the District Court did not 
specifically rule on whether HRPP Rule 48 had been violated, its decision appears to have been based on concerns that HRPP Rule 48 may have been violated.
2 In addition, both parties cite to HRPP 
Rule 48 in support of their analysis on appeal. Accordingly, we will treat and analyze the District Court's dismissal as one under HRPP Rule 48. 
In State v. Hern, Nos. CAAP-11-0000644 and CAAP-12­
0000528, 2013 WL 1233543 (Hawaii App. March 27, 2013), this court
 held that "in determining whether to dismiss a charge with or
 without prejudice under HRPP Rule 48(b), the trial court must not
 
3
only consider the Estencion factors,[ ] but must also clearly
articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any other
 factor it considered in rendering its decision." Hern, 2013 WL
 
1233543, at *5. In this case, the only explanation provided by
 the District Court for its decision to dismiss the case without
 prejudice was: "I think we're close -- close to that [HRPP Rule
 48] edge, so we're going to dismiss this matter without
 prejudice[.]" The District Court's explanation did not clearly
 articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any other
 factor it considered in rendering its decision, and we conclude
 that the record is inadequate to permit meaningful review of the
 District Court's exercise of discretion in dismissing the case
 without prejudice. See Hern, 2013 WL 1233543, at *5-6.
 
Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's Judgment 
dismissing the case without prejudice, and we remand the case
 
2
 The District Court stated: "I think we're close -- close to that edge,
so we're going to dismiss this matter without prejudice[.]"

 The "Estencion factors" are: "'[(1)] the seriousness of the offense;
 
[(2)] the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;
and [(3)] the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of [HRPP Rule
48] and on the administration of justice.'” State v. Hern, Nos. CAAP-11­
0000644 and CAAP-12-0000528, 2013 WL 1233543, at *1 (Hawaii App. March 27,
2013) (brackets in original) (quoting State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269,
625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981)).

with instructions that the District Court (1) consider the
 
Estencion factors in determining whether to dismiss Timmons's 
OVUII charge with or without prejudice and (2) make findings that
 clearly articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any
 other factor it considered in rendering its decision.
