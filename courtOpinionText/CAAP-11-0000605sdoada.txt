IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
EICHI OKI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTI-11-047379)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Eichi Oki (Oki) appeals from the
 
"Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,"
 
filed on June 16, 2011 in the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (district court).  The district court convicted Oki of
 
noncompliance with speed limit (speeding), in violation of Hawaii
 
2
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-102(a)(1) (2007 Repl.),  and
sentenced him to pay an $80 fine and various fees.
 
On appeal, Oki presents the following points of error:
 (1)
 The district court erred and deprived him of due
 
process when it denied his request for additional time to present 
1
 The Honorable Linda K.C. Luke presided.
 
2
 HRS § 291C-102(a)(1) provides, "A person violates this section if the
person drives . . . [a] motor vehicle at a speed greater than the maximum
speed limit other than provided in section 291C-105[.]"

his defense.
 
(2) The district court erred in entering judgment
 
against him and denying his "Motion for Reconsideration or New
 
Trial" (Motion for Reconsideration), based on insufficient
 
evidence that Officer Lee recorded his speed with his "LTI 20-20"
 
laser gun (laser gun). Related to this point of error is Oki's
 
contention that in the court's July 26, 2011 Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law, findings of fact (FOFs) 5, 7, 8, and 9 are
 
clearly erroneous, and conclusions of law (COLs) 1 and 2 are
 
wrong.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Oki's points of error as follows.
 
(1) The district court did not abuse its discretion or 
deprive Oki of due process in denying his motion to continue. 
Oki, an attorney, was present during the direct examination of 
Honolulu Police Officer Lee and could have objected on lack-of­
foundation grounds to the court's admission of the officer's 
testimony regarding the speed reading, but failed to do so. Oki 
had over eighty-five minutes to cross-examine Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai' i's (State) sole witness and to present his case. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 611, the court had the authority to "exercise reasonable control over the mode and order 
of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as 
to . . . avoid needless consumption of time[.]" In his reply 
brief, Oki raises for the first time the argument that he was not 
given complete information because the citation he received did 
not tell him the speed that he was accused of traveling. 
However, the citation he received indicated that he was going 16 
mph over the speed limit. Moreover, at the beginning of trial on 
June 16, 2011, the State orally charged Oki, stating that Oki 
drove his vehicle 51 mph in a 35 mph zone. Thus, Oki was 
properly informed of the charge against him prior to trial.

(2) The district court did not err when it convicted 
Oki of speeding and denied his Motion for Reconsideration, where 
the evidence was sufficient to show that Officer Lee recorded 
Oki's speed with the laser gun.  The officer testified that he 
aimed the laser gun at Oki's license plate from 375 feet away and 
obtained a reading of fifty-one miles per hour. The court 
credited Officer Lee's testimony, which was within its 
discretion. See State v. Moleta, 112 Hawai' i 233, 241, 145 P.3d 
776, 784 (App. 2006); State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 
978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999). FOFs 5, 8, and 9 are not clearly 
erroneous, and COLs 1 and 2 are not wrong. Although Oki claims 
that FOF 7 is clearly erroneous, he presents no discernible 
argument on this point and it is deemed waived.3 See Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment," filed on June 16, 2011
 in the District Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 25, 2013.

 Even if we reached the issue and found FOF 7 clearly erroneous, it
would be harmless error. The district court independently found that the
posted speed limit in the subject area was 35 mph, for which there was
sufficient evidence in the record.
