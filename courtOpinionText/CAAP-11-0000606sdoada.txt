v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 96-0078(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Gerald Villanueva (Villanueva),
 
pro se, appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
and Order Denying Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief"
 (Order Denying Petition) filed on August 2, 2011, in the Circuit

 Villanueva filed two notices of appeal which reference different

governments such as United States and the 50 states have no
 
lawful authority or Jurisdiction over men." 
We conclude that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction 
over Villanueva's underlying criminal case. See Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 701-106 (1993); State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i 
479, 486-87, 291 P.3d 377, 384-85 (2013). Accordingly, we affirm the Order Denying Petition.
