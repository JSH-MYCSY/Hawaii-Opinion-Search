On appeal, Florence raises a single point of error,
 
contending that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by making
 
two improper remarks during closing argument.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Florence's point of error as follows:
 
[W]henever a defendant alleges prosecutorial misconduct, [the
appellate court] must decide: (1) whether the conduct was
improper; (2) if the conduct was improper, whether the misconduct
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) if the misconduct
was not harmless, whether the misconduct was so egregious as to
bar reprosecution. 
State v. Maluia, 107 Hawai' i 20, 26, 108 P.3d 974, 980 (2005). 
The harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard
 
"requires an examination of the record and a determination of
 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error
 
complained of might have contributed to the conviction." State
 
v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 1238 (1999) 
(citations omitted). This Court will grant a new trial or set 
aside a guilty verdict only where the prosecutorial misconduct 
has "caused prejudice to the defendant's right to a fair trial." 
State v. McGriff, 76 Hawai' i 148, 158, 871 P.2d 782, 792 (1994). 
We consider three factors when determining whether the alleged prosecutorial misconduct reached the level of reversible error: 
"[1] the nature of the alleged misconduct, [2] the promptness or 
lack of a curative instruction, and [3] the strength or weakness 
of the evidence against the defendant." State v. Agrabante, 73 
Haw. 179, 198, 830 P.2d 492, 502 (1992). 
"Where a defendant fails to object to a prosecutor's 
statement during closing argument, appellate review is limited to a determination of whether the prosecutor's alleged misconduct 
amounted to plain error." State v. Iuli, 101 Hawai' i 196, 204, 
65 P.3d 143, 151 (2003). This Court "will apply the plain error standard of review to correct errors which seriously affect the 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial 
proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the 
denial of fundamental rights." State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 
327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) (citations omitted). 
The first alleged impropriety was when the prosecutor
 
argued to the jury:
 
The State submits to you, do not give defendant any credit
for what he's failed to do. He did everything he could at
that time to carry out his intent. It's just circumstances
that were beyond his control, perhaps somebody up above was
looking after Joellen.
 
Defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor's 
statement. Because Florence did not object to the prosecutor's 
comment during closing argument about somebody up above looking 
after Joellen, this Court "must determine whether the 
prosecutor's comment was improper and, if so, whether such 
misconduct constituted plain error that affected [Florence's] 
substantial rights." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 304, 926 
P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (citations omitted). 
A prosecutor is afforded "wide latitude . . . in 
discussing the evidence." Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304, 926 P.2d at 
209 (citations omitted). However, "arguments that rely on 
racial, religious, ethnic, political, economic, or other 
prejudices of the jurors introduce into the trial elements of 
irrelevance, irrationality, and unfairness that cannot be 
tolerated." Rogan, 91 Hawai' i at 424, 984 P.2d at 1250 (emphasis 
added). Although the cases cited by Florence involve much more religiously explicit statements than here, the prosecutor's 
statement that "perhaps somebody up above was looking after 
Joellen[]" appears to be an improper and irrelevant religious 
reference. Id. 
Nevertheless, this comment does not warrant the plain 
error relief that Florence seeks in light of the nature of the 
conduct, curative instructions, and strength of the evidence 
against Florence. See Iuli, 101 Hawai' i at 208, 65 P.3d at 155.

The prosecutor's vague, fleeting reference to a higher power was
 
not overtly religious, did not specifically mention God or the
 
Bible, and was not egregious or inflammatory. In addition, the
 
Circuit Court clearly instructed the jury to not be influenced by
 
passion or prejudice against Florence: 
You must not be influenced by pity for the defendant, or by
passion or prejudice against the defendant. Both the
 prosecution and the defendant have a right to demand, and
they do demand and expect that you will conscientiously and
dispassionately consider and weigh all of the evidence and
follow these instructions, and that you will reach a just
verdict.
 
In addition, the Circuit Court made clear to the jury
 
that, in reaching its verdict, it should not consider closing
 
arguments made by counsel to be part of the evidence:
 
You must consider only the evidence which has been presented
to you in this case and such inferences therefrom as may be
justified by reason and common sense. . . . 
Statements or remarks made by counsel are not evidence.
 
There is no reason to believe, under the circumstances 
of this case, that the jury did not follow the Circuit Court's 
instructions. See State v. Knight, 80 Hawai' i 318, 327, 909 P.2d 
1133, 1142 (1996) (citations omitted) (stating that "[a]s a rule, juries are presumed to . . . follow all of the trial court's 
instructions."). Accordingly, the Circuit Court's clear and 
cogent instructions cured any impropriety. 
Finally, there was ample, strong evidence against
 
Florence. For example, Florence admitted that he "[w]ent in
 
there, trying to get [Joellen's] attention and load the gun up,
 
and I don't know why, I put it up on the side of her head, and I
 
pulled the trigger." Ariel also corroborated Joellen's story,
 
testifying that Florence "put[] a finger to my temple and said he
 
should put a bullet through my head, too." Furthermore, it was
 
uncontested that Florence and Joellen got into an intense
 
argument immediately before Joellen was injured, which provided
 
evidence supporting Florence's intent to shoot her.

The second allegedly improper statement was as follows:
 
We don't give him credit for not achieving his goal by
circumstances that intervened, that prevented him from doing
 so. We don't give him a break just because she's still
alive today. That is not any thanks to him.
 
That is why you need to hold him fully responsible for
everything he's done and not giving [sic] him any breaks,
which they are asking for.
 
Florence's objection to this argument was overruled by
 
the Circuit Court.
 
"It is [] within the bounds of legitimate argument for 
prosecutors to state, discuss, and comment on the evidence as 
well as to draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence." 
Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304-05, 926 P.2d at 209-10 (citation 
omitted). The prosecutor's statement to the jury that "you need to hold [Florence] fully responsible for everything he's done and 
not giving [sic] him any breaks, which they are asking for[]" was 
not improper because the prosecutor was commenting on the 
evidence and presenting reasonable conclusions to be drawn from 
the evidence. The prosecutor's use of the word "breaks" 
referenced the prosecutor's argument that the evidence presented 
at trial proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Florence was 
guilty of attempted murder and that if Florence was convicted of 
an included offense he would be receiving a "break" in light of 
the evidence. The prosecutor explained to the jury that the 
evidence supported an attempted murder conviction: "For you to 
consider the [included offenses], you're ignoring everything he's 
done, loading the firearm, using the firearm, pointing the 
firearm to her head and pulling the trigger and injuring her." 
In State v. Ganal, 81 Hawai' i 358, 917 P.2d 370 (1996), 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court found that a prosecutor's closing 
remarks, such as "what gives him the right," "excuse," "not being held accountable," and "stand up like a man," were not improper 
because "the prosecutor was merely cautioning the jury not to 
excuse [the defendant's] conduct out of sympathy and was 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
characterizing [the defendant's] expert's theories as invitations 
to give [the defendant] a 'break,' even though the proffered 
defense did not apply." Id. at 389, 917 P.2d at 377. Similarly, 
here, the prosecutor's statement was not improper because the prosecutor was merely cautioning the jury not to excuse 
Florence's conduct because Joellen is still alive and was 
characterizing Florence's theory, including his EMED defense, as 
an invitation to give Florence a break in light of the evidence 
proving his guilt. See Ganal, 81 Hawai' i at 389, 917 P.2d at 
377. Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor's argument was
 
not improper.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 15, 2011
 
Judgment is affirmed.
