APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2007-479(M) (7-03-10114))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Kimberly K. F. Wilson (Wilson) 
appeals from the Decision and Order (D&O) of the Labor and 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) filed July 22, 2011, 
affirming the Disability Compensation Division, Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations' (DLIR) October 16, 2007 decision 
in favor of self-insured Employer-Appellee State of Hawai' i, 
Department of Health (DOH). The decision found the DOH not liable for medical treatment Wilson received from May 7, 2004 to 
December 1, 2006. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 19, 2003, Wilson suffered an injury while
 
employed by the DOH, and she submitted a workers' compensation
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
claim. The State Workers' Compensation Division, which
 
administers and processes workers' compensation claims for the
 
DOH and other state agencies, assigned a claims adjuster
 
(adjuster) to Wilson's case and instructed interested parties to
 
direct further correspondence to the adjuster.
 
The adjuster contacted Wilson to discuss her claim and
 
ongoing treatment. The adjuster informed Wilson that the DOH
 
accepted liability temporarily through September 4, 2003 but
 
denied further liability pending an independent medical
 
examination (IME) by Lorne Direnfeld, M.D. (Dr. Direnfeld). The
 
adjuster also confirmed that Marcus Griffin, M.D. (Dr. Griffin)
 
would be Wilson's attending physician and that only disability
 
certifications from Dr. Griffin would be honored. Wilson had
 
already obtained treatment and consultations from a number of
 
doctors, and the adjuster informed Wilson that other primary care
 
providers would no longer be honored and that all referrals were
 
subject to the DOH's approval.
 
Dr. Direnfeld conducted an IME of Wilson, and his
 
medical opinion concluded she had suffered a compensable neck
 
injury, but her ongoing condition was unrelated to her work
 
injury. The adjuster informed Wilson and Dr. Griffin that, based
 
on Dr. Direnfeld's opinion, the DOH contested liability for
 
further medical services, effective March 11, 2004. The DLIR
 
conducted a hearing and issued a decision on June 7, 2004,
 
crediting Dr. Direnfeld's post-IME medical opinion and relieving
 
the DOH of further liability for Wilson's treatment after March
 
11, 2004. Wilson appealed the DLIR's decision to the LIRAB on
 
June 15, 2004.
 
In the time between the DLIR decision and the LIRAB
 
hearing, Wilson received further treatment from Dr. Griffin and
 
from a number of out-of-state health care providers. The record
 
is devoid of any approved treatment plan provided by Dr. Griffin
 
during the relevant time period. Dr. Griffin referred Wilson to
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Mayo Clinic on March 29, 2004, but nothing in the record 
indicates when, if ever, the DOH received this referral. On May 
7, 2004, Wilson received treatment from Dr. Griffin at the Kihei-
Wailea Medical Center. On June 17, 2004, Wilson permanently 
relocated from Hawai' i and underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic 
in Minnesota on June 30, 2004. She continued to receive further treatment from the Mayo Clinic and also received treatment from 
Altru Health System, Altru Hospital, and Laidlaw Psychological 
Services. Nothing in the record indicates Wilson submitted a 
request for change of physicians or referrals for the treatment 
she received from any of these health care providers. The 
earliest clear indication that the DOH had received actual notice 
of Wilson's out-of-state treatment is from late January 2005, 
when the Mayo Clinic first communicated with the adjuster 
regarding payment. 
On October 12, 2005, the LIRAB held a hearing on
 
Wilson's appeal. The LIRAB received testimony from Nicholas
 
Maragos, M.D. (Dr. Maragos), Wilson's doctor at the Mayo Clinic,
 
and from Dr. Direnfeld, who had changed his opinion after
 
reviewing Dr. Maragos's reports. The DOH denied liability on the
 
grounds that Wilson's ongoing condition was unrelated to her work
 
injury; nothing in the record indicates the DOH mentioned the
 
lack of a treatment plan or referral for Wilson's treatment. The
 
LIRAB credited the doctors' testimony and issued a decision on
 
January 11, 2006, vacating the DLIR's decision and concluding
 
Wilson was entitled to continuing medical care after March 11,
 
2004.
 
On December 6, 2006, Wilson's attorney wrote to the
 
adjuster seeking payment of Wilson's treatment from the Mayo
 
Clinic, Altru Hospital, Altru Health System, and Laidlaw
 
Psychological Services, and for her treatment from Kihei-Wailea
 
Medical Center on May 7, 2004. On May 31, 2007, Wilson's
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
attorney filed a request for a hearing based on the DOH's refusal
 
to pay benefits.
 
On August 23, 2007, the DLIR held a hearing on the 
issue of whether the DOH was liable for the medical treatment 
Wilson had received from May 7, 2004 to December 1, 2006. The 
DOH denied liability for these treatments because Wilson had 
failed to submit WC-2 Physician's Reports, treatment plans, or 
requests for consultations and concurrent treatment during the 
relevant period as required by Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
Chapter 386 and its related rules. The DLIR's decision, issued October 16, 2007, credited the DOH's evidence and found the DOH 
not liable. 
Wilson timely appealed the DLIR's decision to the
 
LIRAB, and on July 22, 2011, the LIRAB issued the D&O affirming
 
the DLIR's decision and concluding the DOH was not liable for
 
Wilson's medical treatment from May 7, 2004 to December 1, 2006. 
Wilson timely filed this appeal on August 12, 2011.
 
On appeal, Wilson contends the LIRAB erred as a matter
 
of law in finding the following Findings of Fact (FOFs):
 
. . . .
 
9. The Board finds that the foregoing "Referral"
[completed by Dr. Griffin referring Wilson to Mayo Clinic]
does not meet the requirements of Sections 12-15-42 or
12-15-40 of the Hawaii Workers' Compensation Medical Fee
Schedule.
 
10. Nicholas E. Maragos, M.D., a physician at the Mayo
Clinic, identified himself as the attending physician on a
WC-2 Physician's Report form ("WC-2") dated September 13,
2006 and Claimant, during her deposition, described him as
the "commander" of her medical treatment. However, there
was no request that Claimant be allowed a change in
attending physician, and Dr. Griffin remained Claimant's
attending physician during the relevant time period.
 
. . . .
 
13. The Board finds that the medical care, services,
and supplies provided by Altru Health Systems, Laidlaw
Psychological Services, and Mayo clinic were not directed by
her attending physician, Dr. Griffin.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wilson also challenges the following language from the
 
LIRAB's Conclusion of Law (COL): 
[T]he Board concludes that Employer is not liable for
medical care, services, or supplies provided by Altru Health
Systems, Laidlaw Psychological Services, and Mayo Clinic
from May 7, 2004 to December 1, 2006. Said services were
 not requested by or even directed by Claimant's attending
physician. . . . The Board further concludes that with
regard to medical care, services, or supplies provided by
Dr. Griffin, that the same were not provided pursuant to a
valid Workers' Compensation Treatment Plan.
 
II. 	STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"Review of a decision made by a court upon its review

Appellate review of the LIRAB's decision is governed
by HRS § 91-14(g) (1993), which provides that:
 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), [conclusions] are reviewable under

In determining whether an agency determination should begiven deference, the standard to be applied is as follows: 
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrative
agency, we first decide whether the legislature
granted the agency discretion to make the
determination being reviewed. 
If the legislature has
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then we review the agency's action pursuant to
the deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearing
in mind that the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion). If the legislature has not
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then the agency's conclusions are subject to
de novo review.

1The DOH correctly asserts that Wilson raised this point for the
first time on appeal, and generally the appellate court "will not consider an
issue not raised below unless justice so requires."  Bitney v. Honolulu Police
Dept., 96 Hawai# i 243, 251, 30 P.3d 257, 265 (2001).  Because no additional facts
are necessary to determine this issue, and because this issue calls for the
interpretation of HRS Chapter 386 and its related rules, see Earl M. Jorgensen
Co. v. Mark Constr.,  56 Haw. 466, 476, 540 P.2d 978, 985 (1975), we will consider
this issue.
7III.  DISCUSSION
A.Applicability Of Workers' Compensation Law To Wilson's 
Treatment
This case requires us to interpret provisions of the
Hawai#i Revised Statutes Chapter 386 and Hawai #i Administrative
Rules (HAR) Title 12, Chapter 15 to ascertain to what extent our
workers' compensation laws apply to out-of-state health care
providers.1  Specifically, Wilson contends the requirements of
HAR §§ 12-15-38, 12-15-40, and 12-15-42 should not apply to the
treatment she received from out-of-state health care providers. 
HAR § 12-15-38 states "[c]hanges in attending physician by the
injured employee subsequent to the first change require prior
approval by the director [of the DLIR] or DOH."  HAR §§ 12-15-40
and 12-15-42 state "the attending physician shall obtain
permission from the DOH" before initiating a referral for
concurrent treatment or for consultation by another health care
provider.  
Wilson does not dispute that Dr. Griffin failed to
submit a treatment plan or referrals for Wilson's treatment
during the period at issue.  However, Wilson contends the LIRAB
erred as a matter of law by requiring Wilson's out-of-state
health care providers to comply with Hawai# i's requirements. 
Wilson points out that neither HRS Chapter 386 nor the
administrative rules contain any specific provisions regarding
treatment by out-of-state health care providers for employees who
permanently relocate.  Because of this ambiguity, and because HRS
§ 386-26 (1993) characterizes the rules in HAR Title 12, ChapterNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2
15 as "guidelines,"  Wilson argues the rules cannot be applied
against her to deny care, so long as the treatment was reasonable
 
and necessary pursuant to HRS § 386-21 (1993).
 
We do not read the statute so broadly, however. 
"Judicial deference to agency expertise is a guiding precept 
where the interpretation and application of broad or ambiguous 
statutory language by an administrative tribunal are the subject 
of review." Holi v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., Inc., 113 Hawai' i 196, 
206, 150 P.3d 845, 855 (App. 2007) (quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 144-45, 9 P.3d 409, 456-57 
(2000)). Here, the DOH cites five prior LIRAB decisions that generally establish the LIRAB's practice of permitting 
out-of-state treatment but requiring compliance with HRS Chapter 
386 and HAR Title 12, Chapter 15. "[A]dministrative practice, 
consistent and generally unchallenged, will not be overturned 
except for very cogent reasons[.]" Treloar v. Swinerton & 
Walberg Co., 65 Haw. 415, 424, 653 P.2d 420, 426 (1982) (quoting Waikiki Resort Hotel v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 63 Haw. 222, 
243, 624 P.2d 1353, 1368 (1981)). We cannot conclude that the 
LIRAB's interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with 
the intent of the statutory mandate. Haole v. State, 111 Hawai' i 
144, 152, 140 P.3d 377, 385 (2006). One of the purposes of commission administration is "to maintain supervision over the 
entire process of seeing that the claimant receives the full 
benefits" of the compensation law, and the LIRAB's interpretation 
promotes this purpose. See 9-140 Lex K. Larson, Larson's 
Workers' Compensation Law § 140.02 (Matthew Bender, Rev. Ed.). 
Furthermore, HRS § 386-21 provides that if an employee
 
2
 Wilson cites additional language from HRS § 386-26 as support, but
this language was not added until 2005. See 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws, Sp. Sess., Act
11, §5 at 816 (adding to HRS § 386-26, "The guidelines shall not be considered an
authoritative prescription for health care, nor shall they preclude any health
care provider from drawing upon the health care provider's medical judgment and
expertise in determining the most appropriate care.").
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(continued...)
9wishes to change physicians, "the employee may do so in
accordance with rules prescribed by the director." (Emphasis
added.)  As the DOH argues, treatment plans, reports, and
referrals serve an important purpose in coordinating the
claimant's treatment among multiple health care providers,
providing notice to the DOH and insurer, and reducing health care
costs.  We do not accept as a general rule that medical care
(even out-of-state care necessitated by relocation) need not be
held to the requirements of HRS Chapter 386 and HAR Title 12,
Chapter 15.  
Wilson also argues that physicians need not comply with
the procedural requirements of the workers' compensation law
during periods in which the DOH is denying the claim.  During the
period at issue, the DLIR decision denying the DOH's liability
for care after March 11, 2004 was still in place, and Wilson's
appeal to the LIRAB was pending.  However, nothing in HRS Chapter
386 or in the HAR excuses a health care provider from complying
with all requirements while the compensability of the claim
remains at issue and regardless of whether the employer is making
payments while the claimant's appeal is pending.  Therefore, we
conclude the LIRAB did not err as a matter of law in applying HRS
Chapter 386 and the HAR to Wilson's claim.
B.Waiver And Estoppel
Wilson argues the DOH waived strict procedural
compliance through its conduct.  Specifically, Wilson points to
the adjuster's acceptance of Wilson's change of physician from
Steven Key, D.C. (Dr. Key) to Dr. Griffin via an informal phone
call, without requiring any formal documentation as required by
HAR § 12-15-38.3  However, we conclude waiver is inapplicable
3The DOH claims the change from Dr. Key to Dr. Griffin was Wilson's
first change in physician, and HAR § 12-15-38 requires prior approval only for
changes "subsequent to the first change."  However, Form WC-1, DOH's Report of
Industrial Injury dated May 8, 2003 lists Gayland Yee, M.D. (Dr. Yee) as theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because "[w]aiver must be 'intentional.'" Hewahewa v. Lalakea, 
35 Haw. 213, 218-19 (Haw Terr. 1939). See also Coon v. City and 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai' i 233, 261, 47 P.3d 348, 376 (2002) 
("Generally, waiver is defined as an intentional relinquishment 
of a known right, a voluntary relinquishment of rights, and the 
relinquishment or refusal to use a right.") (quoting In re Estate 
of Searl, 72 Haw. 222, 226-27, 811 P.2d 828, 831 (1991)). 
Nothing in the record suggests the DOH or the DLIR intended to 
waive compliance with the HAR's procedural requirements. In the 
adjuster's letter to Wilson accepting Dr. Griffin as the new 
attending physician, she informed Wilson that no other primary 
care provider would be honored and that all referrals were 
subject to the DOH's approval, indicating an intention to enforce 
the HAR's procedural requirements. 
Based on the particular facts of this case, however, we 
conclude the doctrine of quasi-estoppel applies. Hawai' i 
recognizes the theory of quasi-estoppel, which is "a species of equitable estoppel which has its basis in election, waiver, 
acquiescence, or even acceptance of benefits and which precludes 
a party from asserting to another's disadvantage, a right 
inconsistent with a position previously taken by [the party]." 
Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 123 Hawai' i 266, 276, 231 P.3d 983, 
993 (App. 2010), aff'd, 125 Haw. 128, 254 P.3d 439 (2011). 
Although equitable estoppel requires that the party to be 
estopped acted wilfully, Maria v. Freitas, 73 Haw. 266, 273, 832 
P.2d 259, 264 (1992), quasi-estoppel does not require proof of 
misrepresentation or concealment of facts by one and ignorance of 
the other. Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai' i 91, 124, 969 P.2d 1209, 
3(...continued)
treating physician, and Dr. Key apparently became the treating physician at
some point between May 20, 2003 and July 21, 2003. Thus, the change from Dr.
Yee to Dr. Key would have been the first change in physician, and under HAR §
12-15-38 the change from Dr. Key to Dr. Griffin required prior approval by the
director or DOH. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1242 (1998). 
"Equitable estoppel is a device originating in courts
 
of equity and, as such, depends on a close analysis of individual
 
fact situations for its application." Cosmopolitan Fin. Corp. v.
 
Runnels, 2 Haw. App. 33, 36, 625 P.2d 390, 394 (1981). Before
 quasi-estoppel can be applied against a party, "it must appear
 
that he possesses full knowledge of all the material particulars
 
and circumstances and was fully apprised of the effect of the
 
acts ratified and of his legal rights in the matter." Anderson
 
v. Anderson, 59 Haw. 575, 589, 585 P.2d 938, 946 (1978) (internal
 quotation marks omitted). In this case, any action by or notice
 
to the adjuster is imputed to the DOH because HAR § 12-15-1
 
defines an "employer" as including "a self-insured employer or
 
the self-insured employer's adjuster or designated representative
 
unless clearly indicated otherwise[.]" 
The record indicates the employer never expressly
 
approved of Wilson's treatment and apparently did not make any
 
payments for Wilson's treatment from any of the providers during
 
the period at issue.
4 However, our review of the record
 
establishes that the employer had knowledge of Wilson's ongoing
 out-of-state treatment and noncompliance with the procedural
 
requirements from late January 2005 yet raised no objection to
 
her noncompliance until July 2007. According to a letter from a
 
Mayo Clinic legal representative to Wilson's attorney, the clinic
 
first contacted the adjuster on January 24, 2005 requesting
 
payment for Wilson's unpaid balances. This claim sufficed to
 
apprise the DOH of Wilson's ongoing treatment. Two days later,
 
the clinic received a response from the adjuster stating that the
 
claims were denied and that no payment would be issue. However,
 
4
 The Mayo Clinic stated it did receive some payments; however, the
only payments in the record were made well after December 1, 2006 and are thus
irrelevant to whether the DOH gave implied authorization for Wilson's
treatment during the period at issue. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the denial was apparently based on the DLIR decision denying
 
compensability in place at the time and not on noncompliance with
 
procedure, because the adjuster made no reference to the lack of
 
treatment plans or referrals. 
After the LIRAB issued its January 11, 2006 decision in 
Wilson's favor, the Mayo Clinic resubmitted its bills and 
contacted the adjuster nine more times regarding the status of 
its pending bills. The adjuster's responses indicated the bills 
were under review or being processed. It was not until July 13, 
2007 that the adjuster informed the Mayo Clinic for the first 
time of the need to comply with Hawai' i law. 
The DOH also did not make any mention of Wilson's
 
noncompliance during the October 12, 2005 LIRAB hearing appealing
 
the DLIR's decision denying compensability. The record contains
 
multiple communications from June 2005 between Wilson's attorney,
 
the DOH, the adjuster, and Dr. Direnfeld, in which the parties
 
noted Wilson's relocation and treatment from Dr. Maragos and the
 
Mayo Clinic. During discovery and at the hearing, the DOH
 
challenged Dr. Maragos's medical evidence and opinion, but the
 
record contains no indication the DOH ever mentioned the lack of
 
treatment plans or referrals or considered Dr. Maragos's
 
treatment inappropriate in any way. The DLIR's decision
 
ultimately credited Dr. Maragos's opinion, and the DOH did not
 
appeal this decision. The DOH's actions from this hearing are
 
further indication that it considered Dr. Maragos's treatment
 
authorized. Under these circumstances, it was entirely
 
reasonable for Wilson to conclude she could continue obtaining
 
treatment and incurring medical expenses without a treatment plan
 
or referral. 
Therefore, the record establishes the DOH had knowledge
 
that Wilson was receiving out-of-state treatment for two and a
 
half years, from late January 2005 to July 2007, before providing
 
any notice that it considered Wilson's treatment unauthorized
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because of her noncompliance with procedural requirements. 
Courts and commissions in other jurisdictions have held that an
 
employee may engage medical services "if the employer has
 
expressly or impliedly conveyed to the employee the impression
 
that the employee has authorization to proceed in this fashion,
 
or with full knowledge has over a sustained period of time failed
 
to object to claimant's change of physician." 5-94 Larson's
 
Workers' Compensation Law § 94.02 (listing cases applying
 
estoppel against employers). We hold that the employer's
 
sustained silence in this case amounted to an implied
 
authorization of Wilson's treatment, and we apply the doctrine of
 
quasi-estoppel to avoid an inequitable result. 
Furthermore, although the DOH's conduct after December
 
1, 2006 is not directly relevant to the question of whether the
 
DOH gave Wilson implied authorization during the period at issue,
 
its conduct provides further support for concluding the DOH
 
generally acquiesced in Wilson's treatment. After the LIRAB
 
issued its January 11, 2006 decision in Wilson's favor, the DOH
 
participated in another supplemental hearing before the DLIR on
 
July 27, 2006, at which the DLIR ordered the DOH to pay Wilson
 
temporary total disability benefits upon receiving disability
 
certification from Dr. Maragos. The DOH did not appeal the
 
DLIR's decision, implying that it recognized Dr. Maragos as the
 
attending physician authorized to issue disability
 
certifications. The adjuster also received multiple requests for
 
payment from Wilson's attorney and the Mayo Clinic, and Wilson
 
called and wrote to the adjuster to discuss payment processing. 
However, the record indicates that neither the adjuster nor the
 
DOH raised the noncompliance issue at any point, either to Wilson
 
or to the DLIR, until the July 13, 2007 letter to the Mayo
 
Clinic.
 
At oral argument, the DOH argued that estoppel should
 
not apply against it because the June 7, 2004 DLIR decision

relieving the DOH of liability, which was in place during the
 
period at issue, should also relieve the DOH of any duty to
 
notify Wilson of procedural defects. Neither party has directed
 
this court to an authority that directly addresses the employer's
 
or the employee's duties pending an ongoing appeal. As discussed
 
above, we concluded the LIRAB did not err as a matter of law in
 
requiring Wilson and her providers to comply with all
 
requirements of HRS Chapter 386 and the HAR pending litigation of
 
compensability. Likewise, we conclude the employer is not
 
relieved of its obligation to maintain communication with the
 
employee and to treat the employee's claim as potentially
 
meritorious until the compensability determination has become
 
final. The record reflects that before the DLIR decision, the
 
adjuster had not timely notified Wilson and her physicians of the
 
procedural requirements and of any defects she found. A DLIR
 
decision denying compensability does not give the employer
 
license to fall silent about known procedural defects, allowing
 
the employee to continue incurring medical expenses, and then
 
raise those defects for the first time only after an adverse
 
LIRAB decision.
 
In cases such as this, where there are no clear rules
 
governing procedure for seeking treatment out-of-state and during
 
periods in which the employer is held not liable for medical care
 
pending an ongoing appeal, the employer is clearly in a better
 
position to be aware of the requirements of the law and to know
 
when an employee is not satisfying those requirements. The DOH
 
knew from the beginning that Wilson would continue seeking
 
medical care pending the appeal because Dr. Direnfeld's post-IME
 
reports concluded Wilson's symptoms were complex and uncommon and
 
would require further treatment, and the January 2005 contact
 
from the Mayo Clinic provided specific notice of Wilson's out-of­
state care. Where the employer has notice of an injured
 
employee's ongoing treatment and the claim's status is unclear,

the burden to timely determine whether treatment is inappropriate
 
should be placed on the employer. Therefore, we conclude the DOH
 
is estopped from using Wilson's failure to comply with HAR §§ 12­
15-38, 12-15-40, and 12-15-42 to deny liability for Wilson's
 
medical care between May 7, 2004 and December 1, 2006. However,
 
the DOH is not estopped from denying liability on other grounds
 
on remand. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
In light of the foregoing analysis, the Decision and
 
Order of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board filed
 
July 22, 2011 is vacated, and we remand this case to the
 
Disability Compensation Division, Department of Labor and
 
Industrial Relations for further proceedings, including factual
 
determination of whether the medical care was reasonable and
 
related to the work injury.
