(By: 
Reifurth, J., for the court1
 
On January 27, 2012, this court dismissed PlaintiffÂ­
Appellee/Cross-Appellant, Aryn Nakaoka's ("Nakaoka"), cross-
appeal on the grounds that the cross-appeal was untimely under Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4.1(b)(1) and 26. 
On February 27, 2012, Nakaoka filed an application for
 
writ of certiorari seeking review of the January 27, 2012
 dismissal of the cross-appeal. On April 9, 2012, the supreme
 court accepted the application for writ of certiorari and entered
 an order affirming the dismissal of the cross-appeal, but on the
 grounds that the cross-appeal was premature.
 
On March 7, 2012, Nakaoka filed an application to
 
transfer Defendant-Appellant/Cross-Appellee, Hilton Hawaiian

Dismiss Appeal Without Prejudice ("Stipulation") based upon the
 Supreme Court's April 9, 2012 Order Denying Application for
 Transfer. 
Upon consideration of the Stipulation and the foregoing
 
events, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is approved and
 the appeal is dismissed without prejudice.
