APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NOS. AB 2008-471(K); (4-85-02102), (7-87-06054))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
This case considers two Employee's Claim for Workers'
 
Compensation Benefits forms ("WC-5 Forms") filed by Claimant-

Appellant Theresa A. Kuaimoku ("Kuaimoku") on May 5, 2006, and
 
the decisions rendered on those claims by the State Disability
 Compensation Division ("Division") and the State Labor and
 Industrial Relations Appeals Board ("Board"). The WC-5 Forms
 stated that Kuaimoku was reopening old claims relating to
 accidents that occurred on October 25, 1985, and March 6, 1987.

1
 Kuaimoku's claims had been initially resolved via a Compromise and
Settlement Agreement entered into with her employer, the State of Hawai' i,
Department of Education ("Employer"), dated October 30, 1992 and approved by
the Board on December 18, 1992. On July 20, 1995, the Employer submitted WC-3forms ("WC-3 Forms") for the 1985 and 1987 injuries, and marked the boxdesignating the forms as "FINAL REPORT[S]." The WC-3 Forms both stated: "Case closed per DLIR Decision dated 1/28/92 and Labor Appeals Decision dated10/30/92."  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Despite marking the box for "Reopening of old claim" on
 
the WC-5 Forms, Kuaimoku disavowed any intention to reopen her
 
old claims at the initial hearing. Kuaimoku explained that she
 sought only a reinstatement of her medical care and treatment,
 and argued that the statute of limitations that applied to
 reopening an old claim, therefore, did not apply. On
 September 30, 2008, the Division, on behalf of the Director of
 the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations ("Director"),
 entered a decision ("Decision") denying Kuaimoku's claim, finding
 that, since no medical reports relating to the 1985 and 1987
 
2
injuries had been received since 1995,  "it is safe to assume
that reasonable and necessary care had terminated[,]" and that
 "[t]o resume medical care again at this late date cannot be
 allowed, as we cannot determine the relation of the current care
 to the industrial injury." Therefore, the Director concluded
 that, based on Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 386-89(c),
 Kuaimoku was not entitled to further medical expense
 
3
reimbursement  because no payments had been made on the claim
within the past eight years. 

On October 8, 2008, Kuaimoku filed an appeal from the

 
Decision with the Board. On July 27, 2011, the Board issued its
 Decision and Order, affirming the Decision. The Board concluded
 that HRS § 386-89(c) applies to applications for all
 
4
compensation  including medical benefits, and that "[o]nce eight
2 Kuaimoku does not challenge this finding on appeal. "Findings of
fact that are unchallenged on appeal are the operative facts of a case." Cun-
Lara v. State, 126 Hawai' i 541, 544 n.5, 273 P.3d 1227, 1230 n.5 (App. 2012)
(quoting Robert's Haw. Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai' i 
224, 239, 982 P.2d 853, 868 (1999), superseded by statute on other grounds). 
3 Kuaimoku claimed to be seeking "reinstatement of her medical care
and treatment," and the Director concluded that she was not entitled to
"further medical care." The Director could neither to allow nor disallow
 "further medical care" itself, as evidenced by Kuaimoku's testimony that she
had obtained post-1995 claim related medical care for which she had not sought
reimbursement. Rather, the Director could allow or disallow medical expense
payment or reimbursement for further medical care that Kuaimoku might obtain.
As there appears to be no confusion among the parties as to the meaning of the
statements, we characterize the effect of the Decision as denying further
claim-related "medical expense reimbursement."

 HRS § 386-1 provides, in relevant part: "'Compensation' means all
benefits accorded by this chapter to an employee . . . on account of a work
injury as defined in this section; it includes medical and rehabilitation

years passes from the date of the last payment of compensation,
 
the claim is final for all purposes and is not subject to review
 by the Director." Kuaimoku appeals from the Decision and Order. 
On appeal, Kuaimoku asserts that the Board reversibly
 
erred by: (1) concluding that Chung v. Food Pantry, 2 Haw. App.
 136, 627 P.2d 288 (1981), did not apply to the instant case; (2)
 concluding that HRS § 386-89(c) applied to her request for
 reopening, because she "disavowed the request," did not allege a
 change in condition or mistake in fact, and sought continuing
 medical care under HRS § 386-21; (3) concluding that HRS § 386­89(c) "pertains to the determination of 'compensation,'" and that
 "compensation" includes medical and rehabilitation benefits; (4)
 applying HRS § 386-89(c) and concluding that her request was an
 application for reopening that was barred by the eight-year
 statute of limitations; (5) concluding that HRS § 386-89(c)
 applies to applications for reopening for all compensation,
 including reasonable and necessary medical care under HRS § 386­21; (6) concluding that she was not entitled to, and the Employer
 not liable for, medical care, services and supplies beyond 1995
 for injuries sustained in 1985 and 1987; and (7) affirming the
 "Director's decision of February 26, 2009[.]"
5
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Board's Decision and Order and resolve Kuaimoku's
 points of error as follows.
 
4(...continued)
benefits, income and indemnity benefits in cases of disability or death, and
the allowance for funeral and burial expenses." H AW.  REV.  STAT.  § 386-1 (1993)
 
(emphasis added).

 Kuaimoku fails to explain or argue the final point raised. It
 
appears to stem from the text of the Decision and Order, which states that
"[t]he decisions of the Director dated February 26, 2009, are hereby
affirmed." The Decision and Order, however, states earlier that Kuaimoku's
appeal was taken "from the September 30, 2008 decision of the Director," and
notes that the issues to be determined were set out in a Pretrial Order dated
 February 26, 2009. We assume, therefore, that the Board intended to affirm
the Director's September 30, 2008 Decision, and that Kuaimoku intended to
challenge that decision on appeal and not any decisions reflected in the
Pretrial Order.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kuaimoku's appeal centers around her contention that
 
the Board erred in applying the eight-year statute of limitations
 
6
in HRS § 386-89(c)  to her claim for additional medical benefits,
which she claims should instead be governed by HRS § 386-21.7
 
Kuaimoku does not contest the proposition that her claim would be
 
untimely if governed by HRS § 386-89(c). Rather, she argues that
 the subsection is not implicated because she "disavowed the
 request" to reopen and because she presented no "change in or
 mistake of fact." Essentially, Kuaimoku contends that her claim
 
6 HRS § 386-89 provides, in relevant part:
 
§386-89 Reopening of cases; continuing jurisdiction
of director. (a) In the absence of an appeal and within
twenty days after a copy of the decision has been sent to
each party, the director of labor and industrial relations
may upon the director's own motion or upon the application
of any party reopen a case to permit the introduction of
newly discovered evidence, and may render a revised
decision.
 
(b) The director may at any time, either of the
director's own motion or upon the application of any party,
reopen any case on the ground that fraud has been practiced
on the director or on any party and render such decision as
is proper under the circumstances.
 
(c) On the application of any party in interest,
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination of
fact related to the physical condition of the injured
employee, the director may, at any time prior to eight years
after date of the last payment of compensation . . . review
a compensation case and issue a decision which may award,
terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease
compensation. . . .

Immediately after a work injury sustained by an employee and
so long as reasonably needed the employer shall furnish to
the employee all medical care, services, and supplies as the
nature of the injury requires. The liability for the
medical care, services, and supplies shall be subject to the

AW. REV. STAT. § 386-21 (Supp. 2013).

for medical expense reimbursement is not a claim to reopen the
 
case under HRS § 386-89(c) because she does not seek
 compensation, and that employers have unlimited liability for
 continuing medical treatment under HRS chapter 386. We disagree.
 
We begin by observing that courts construing statutory
 
enactments similar to HRS § 386-21 have concluded that employers
 may have open-ended liability for medical treatment. Foote v.
 
O'Neill Packing, 632 N.W.2d 313, 321 (Neb. 2001) (providing
 citation to other jurisdictions holding similarly); Barnes v.
 Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 2 P.3d 1180, 1185 (Cal. 2000); Grover
 v. Indus. Comm'n of Colorado, 759 P.2d 705, 711 (Colo. 1988). This construction, in fact, is consistent with our policy to liberally construe workers' compensation legislation. First Ins. 
Co. of Hawaii v. A&B Properties, 126 Hawai
'i 406, 417, 271 P.3d 
1165, 1176 (2012) (citing Evanson v. Univ. of Hawai 'i, 52 Haw. 
595, 600, 483 P.2d 187, 191 (1971)). That, however, does not end the analysis. 
Hawai
'i law requires that the claimant's medical 
treatment be "reasonably needed . . . as the nature of the injury requires." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 386-21(a). Therefore, an award of 
future treatment as part of the original claim cannot be affirmed without evidence in the record supporting a determination that future treatment will be "reasonably needed" to relieve the claimant from the effects of the work injury. See, e.g., Barnes, 
2 P.3d at 1185 (requiring substantial evidence to support a determination that future treatment will be reasonably necessary); Grover, 759 P.2d at 711–12; Foote, 632 N.W.2d at 321. 
Construing workers' compensation laws in pari materia, 
HRS § 386-89(c)'s eight-year statute of limitations provides a procedure for injured workers if no present need for treatment at the time of the original claim exists, but later arises. See 
Perkins v. Puna Plantation Hawaii, Ltd., No. 12-0000563, 2013 WL 5019431 at *3 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 13, 2013) (construing HRS §§ 386-21(a) and 386-89(c) in pari materia and concluding that HRS § 386-89(c) applies); Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 93 Hawai
'i 116, 130–32, 997 P.2d 42, 56–58 
(2000) (concluding that an employer is required to provide 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
compensation for all medical treatment required if the treatment
 
is "necessitated by the nature of the injury").
 
Kuaimoku received notice of her last payment of
 
compensation when the Employer submitted the WC-3 Forms for the
 1985 and 1987 injuries on July 20, 1995. The WC-3 Forms each
 stated that the cases were closed. At the hearing before the
 Board, Kuaimoku testified to receiving claim-related medical
 treatment sometime after 2004, and paying for those expenses
 herself.
 
Kuaimoku did not file the WC-5 Forms until more than 
eleven years later. Despite Kuaimoku's assertion that she submitted the WC-5 Forms in error and subsequently "disavowed" them, that does not affect HRS § 386-89(c)'s applicability to Kuaimoku's situation, or her failure to meet the statute's requirements in order to continue or reinstate compensation. Cf. 
McLaren v. Paradise Inn Hawai
'i LLC, 132 Hawai 'i 320, 329-31, 321 
P.3d 671, 680–82 (2014) (noting that HRS § 386-89 does not specify a format for an application to reopen a case, and holding that an attorney's letters objecting to the Director's decision and requesting a hearing amounted to an application to reopen the case to permit the introduction of newly discovered evidence). 
Kuaimoku argues that Chung v. Food Pantry, 2 Haw. App.
 
136, 627 P.2d 288 (1981) supports her contention that reopening a
 workers' compensation case is not necessary if the claimant is
 applying for continuing medical care only. In Chung, this court,
 in a per curiam decision, held that the then-applicable two-year
 statute of limitations under Revised Laws of Hawaii ("RLH") § 97­52 (1955), the predecessor to HRS § 386-82, was inapplicable to
 the employee's claim under RLH § 97-53 (1955), the predecessor to
 HRS § 386-83, which specifically provided that the statute of
 limitations in RLH § 97-52 did not apply "[i]f payments of income
 and indemnity benefits have been made by the employer or his
 insurance carrier." Id. at 138, 627 P.2d at 290. Despite the
 
fact that Chung sought a disfigurement award for residual
 scarring resulting from his injury fifteen years earlier, and the
 employer had previously paid no benefits for disfigurement,
 because the employer had paid for medical services, surgical
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
services, and hospital services, we characterized the application
 
as not involving a change in fact or a mistake in a determination
 of fact relating to the claimant's physical condition. Id. at
 
138, 627 P.2d at 290–91.
 
Irrespective of Kuaimoku's disavowal of her request to
 
reopen, she had to submit a request of some sort for approval by
 the Division to pay newly-incurred medical expenses, and she had
 to do so within the context of the cases having been closed in
 1995. As such, and in light of HRS § 386-21(a)'s requirement
 that medical treatment must be "reasonably needed . . . as the
 nature of the injury requires," it was reasonable for the
 Division to consider whether the request was timely and whether,
 in light of the passage of almost twenty-one years since the
 first injury, the request provided a sufficient basis upon which
 to determine its relation to the original injuries. We conclude,
 as we did in Perkins, that HRS § 386-89(c), including its eight-
year statute of limitations, applies where no present need for
 treatment exists, but later arises. See 2013 WL 5019431, at *3.
 
Kuaimoku further argues that HRS § 386-89(c) is
 
inapplicable because the Board was "arbitrary and capricious in
 disavowing its own recent precedent" regarding HRS § 386-89(c)'s
 inapplicability to medical care. Most recently, however, in
 Yamaguchi v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, AB 2005-094 (Haw. LIR App.
 Bd. Jan. 6, 2009), the Board held that HRS § 386-89(c) "applies
 to applications for reopening for all compensation, including
 medical benefits. To the extent that the Board's prior decisions
 may be inconsistent with this conclusion, those decisions are
 overruled." Id. at *2 (footnote omitted). The Board added that
 
HRS § 386-89(c) "establishes an outer limit for an employer's
 liability for compensation, including reasonable and necessary
 medical care under HRS § 386-21." Id. at *2, n.3.
 
"[W]here an administrative agency is charged with the
 
responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a statute which
 contains words of broad and indefinite meaning, courts accord
 persuasive weight to administrative construction and follow the
 same, unless the construction is palpably erroneous." Treloar v.

63 Haw. 222, 242–43, 624 P.2d 1353, 1368 (1981)). "[A] presumption of validity is accorded to decisions of administrative bodies acting within their sphere of expertise and one seeking to upset the order bears the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences." Tam v. Kaiser Permanente, 94 
Hawai
'i 487, 490, 17 P.3d 219, 222 (2001) (citing In re Gray Line 
Hawai'i, Ltd., 93 Hawai 'i 45, 53, 995 P.2d 776, 784 (2000)). 
While the liberal construction of our workers'
 
compensation law is fundamental to our analysis in this area, we
 observe no basis upon which the principle permits us to ignore a
 legislatively-enacted statute of limitations. Turning to the
 legislative history of HRS § 386-89(c) itself, we can discern how
 the legislature intended the statutory time limitation to
 function within the workers' compensation framework.
8
 
Policies regarding the efficiency and accuracy of the
 
workers' compensation system, and the ability of insurance
 carriers to calculate adequate policy premiums, form the
 foundation for the creation of time limitations on reopening
 worker's compensation claims.
 
[T]he administrative and practical difficulties of such a
course have led to severe limitations on the power to reopen
and alter awards. The most serious administrative problem
lies in the necessity of preserving the full case records of
all claimants that have ever received any kind of award,
against the possibility of a future reopening. Moreover,
any attempt to reopen a case based on an injury ten or
fifteen years old must necessarily encounter awkward
problems of proof, because of the long delay and the
difficulty of determining the relationship between some
ancient injury and a present aggravated disability. Another
 argument is that insurance carriers would never know what
kind of future liabilities they might incur, and would have
difficulty in computing appropriate reserves.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
We observe these policies in the legislative history of
 
HRS § 386-89(c)'s time limitation. The Territorial legislature
 
first added a time limit on reopening workers' compensation
 claims in 1939, amending RLH § 7517 to allow review of any
 agreement or award "at any time within seven years after the date
 of the injury or accident or within three years after the date of
 final payment of compensation previously awarded, whichever
 period is longer[.]" 1939 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 206, § 3 at 306. 
The House Judiciary Committee explained its reasons for the
 addition in Standing Committee Report No. 396:
 
In computing premiums on compensation policies, it is
necessary that some rule should obtain under which the
premiums may be more or less definitively fixed, and your
Committee believes that while an award should be subject to
reopening at any time for fraud, nevertheless, where it is
sought by either party to reopen it because of changed
conditions, there should be a limitation of seven years from
the date of the injury or accident or three years from the
date of the last payment of compensation whichever period is
the longer, and your Committee has therefore amended the
second paragraph of section 7517, as contained in section 3
of the Bill, accordingly.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 396, in 1939 House Journal, at 1340. 
The Committee's emphasis on the computation of premiums reveals
 the legislature's motivation in amending the statute to address
 the expense incurred by employers in purchasing the policies. 
The provision was subsequently amended in 1953 and
 
1955. 1953 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 51, § 1 at 167; 1955 Haw. Sess.
 Laws Act 5, § 1 at 4. When the legislature last amended Section
 386-89(c)'s time limitation in 1985, it reduced the period from
 the date of final payment from ten years to eight. 1985 Haw.
 Sess. Laws Act 296, § 9 at 646. The House Committee on
 Employment Opportunities and Labor Relations and the House
 Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce made clear in
 Standing Committee Report No. 326 that the amendments were
 intended to improve the efficiency of the workers' compensation
 system:
 
The purpose of Section 11 of this Bill is to amend the
provisions of section 386-89(c) to reduce the ten-year time
limit for reopening applications to an eight-year time limit
for reopening requests.
 
Your Committees believe that a shorter timeframe
 
furthers the timely and expeditious disposition of cases

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
within the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 326, in 1985 House Journal, at 1130. 
Furthermore, the Senate Committee on Labor and Employment stated
 that the bill's purpose was to make the workers' compensation
 system "both effective and efficient" while the Senate Ways and
 Means Committee stated that provisions of the bill aimed at
 "reduc[ing] the total cost of the workers' compensation program."
 S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 806, in 1985 Senate Journal, at 1230; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 853, in 1985 Senate Journal, at 1256. Considering the legislative history of the time limitation in HRS § 386-89(c), and applying the presumption of validity to the agency's construction of its statute, Gillan, 119 Hawai
'i at 114, 
194 P.3d at 1076, we conclude that interpreting HRS chapter 386 to provide employers with open-ended liability for new claims for medical treatment, no matter how long after the original claim has been closed, is inappropriate. Thus, the Board did not err in its construction of the statute. 
Kuaimoku contends that HRS § 386-21 is part of a
 
detailed framework that determines a claimant's entitlement to
 medical care, services, and supplies, and lists a number of
 workers' compensation administrative regulations that determine
 the frequency and duration of medical care. Kuaimoku also argues
 that the legislative history of HRS § 386-21 "compel[s] employers
 to provide injured employees . . . unlimited medical care." We
 disagree. There is no evidence that the Employer failed to
 comply with the regulations prior to closing Kuaimoku's case. 
Moreover, the legislative history cited by Kuaimoku recognizes
 the Director's ability and discretion to determine appropriate
 treatment and limit employers' liability.
 
As we did in Perkins, we construe HRS §§ 386-21 and
 
386-89(c) in pari materia and conclude that HRS § 386-89(c)
 applies to claims for medical benefits. Accordingly, the Board
 did not err in applying HRS § 386-89(c) and concluding that
 Kuaimoku did not satisfy its eight-year time requirement. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the July 27, 2011 Decision
