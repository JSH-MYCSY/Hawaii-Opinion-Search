APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0310)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this appeal arising out of a loan dispute,
 
Defendants-Appellants Tricia Morris (Morris) and Herman-Morris
 
Enterprises, Inc., dba Hawaii's Premiere Mortgage Company (HPMC)
 
appeal from the July 28, 2011 Final Judgment (Judgment) and the
 
July 28, 2011 "Rule 54(b) Final Judgment on Count III: Breach of
 
Guaranty of Verified Complaint against Defendants Tricia Morris
 
and Herman-Morris Enterprises, Inc., d.b.a. Hawai' i's Premiere 
Mortgage Company" (Certified-Judgment) both entered in the
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court).  Judgment
 
was entered in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees Arthur Tai and Cathy
 
Tai (collectively, Tais) and against Morris, HPMC and Defendant-
Appellee Richard Leonard Radford (Radford).
 
I. Background
 
The Tais loaned $210,000 to Radford. Morris executed a
 
guaranty that is at issue in this appeal. Radford defaulted on
 
his contractual promise to repay the loan. On May 13, 2010, the
 
Tais filed a Verified Complaint (Complaint) against Radford,
 
Morris and HPMC asserting three counts:
 
(1) breach of contract against Radford;
 
(2) quantum meruit against Radford; and
 
(3) breach of guaranty against Morris and HPMC.
 
On June 16, 2010, Morris and HPMC filed their Verified
 
Answer (Answer) to the Tais' Complaint. Radford failed to answer
 the Tais' Complaint and on June 30, 2010, the circuit court
 
entered a default against Radford. On May 23, 2011, the circuit
 
court resolved the remaining claims by granting the Tais' motion
 
for partial summary judgment.
 
On July 28, 2011, the circuit court entered Judgment in 
favor of the Tais and against Radford on Count 1 and Count 2 and 
in favor of the Tais and against Morris and HPMC on Count 3. On 
the same day, the circuit court entered a Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 54(b) Certified-Judgment in favor of the Tais and against Morris and HPMC on Count 3. 
On August 22, 2011, Morris and HPMC filed a notice of
 
appeal from the Judgment and Certified-Judgment.
 
II. Discussion
 
On appeal, Morris and HPMC contend the circuit court
 
erred in granting the Tais' motion for partial summary judgment
 
because it "was not appropriate in view of disputed facts

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
material to contract issues of ambiguity and consideration[.]"
 
Morris and HPMC also contend the circuit court erred in granting
 
the Tais' motion for attorney fees and costs because Morris and
 
HPMC believe they will prevail in this appeal.
 
The language of the Personal Guaranty (Guaranty) is as
 
follows:
 
This [Guaranty] is entered into as of April 11, 2008.
 
Mortgage dated August 9, 2006 by and between
[RADFORD], an individual, whose address is at PO BOX 678,
KIHEI, HAWAII 96753 (the "Borrower"), in favor of [TAIS],
husband and wife, whose address is at 3950 KALAI WAA DRIVE
T-103, KIHEI, HAWAII 96753 (collectively, the "Lender").
 
Mortgage dated August 9, 2006 is being crossÂ­
collaterized [sic] with property located at 163 West Ikea
Kai Place, Kihei, Hawaii 96753 by Mortgage dated April 10,
2008.
 
[Morris], President of [HPMC], agrees to act as
Guarantor, to prevent any losses to the Lender in the event
of Borrower's default.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has executed this
Guaranty as of the day and year first above written.
 
Generally, the determination of whether a contract is
 
ambiguous is a question of law. Foundation Int'l., Inc. v. E.T.
 
Ige Constr., Inc., 102 Hawai' i 487, 496, 78 P.3d 23, 32 (2003). 
To determine whether ambiguity exists, this court has said
that the test lies not necessarily in the presence of
particular ambiguous words or phrases but rather in the
purport of the document itself, whether or not particular
words or phrases in themselves be uncertain or doubtful in
meaning. A court should look no further than the four
corners of the document to determine whether an ambiguity
exists.
 
Id. at 496-97, 78 P.3d at 32-33 (internal quotation marks and
 
citations omitted). The Guaranty refers to an August 9, 2006
 
mortgage between Radford (identified as the borrower) and the
 
Tais (identified as the lender) and that the August 9, 2006
 
mortgage is being "cross-collaterized [sic] with property located
 
at 163 West Ikea Kai Place, Kihei, Hawaii 96753 by Mortgage dated
 
April 10, 2008." The Guaranty then states "[Morris], President
 
of [HPMC], agrees to act as Guarantor, to prevent any losses to
 
3
                    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Lender in the event of Borrower's default." The signature
 
line for the Guaranty is signed by Morris in the following
 
fashion:
 
HERMAN-MORRIS ENTERPRISES, INC.
dba Hawaii's Premier Mortgage Company
 
Name: TRICIA MORRIS
 
It's [sic] President
Address: 535 Lipoa Parkway, Suite 101
KIHEI, HAWAII 96753
 
The document is ambiguous as to whether Morris and/or 
HPMC is the intended guarantor. The circuit court held that both 
Morris and HPMC are liable under the Guaranty. In Hokama v. 
Relinc Corp., 57 Haw. 470, 559 P.2d 279 (1977), the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court vacated a summary judgment ruling dealing with somewhat analogous circumstances. In Hokama, the president and 
secretary of a corporation signed contracts under signature lines 
similar to the instant case. There, the trial court had granted 
summary judgment for the two corporate officers, ruling that they 
did not have personal liability for the contracts they had 
signed. The supreme court, however, held that the contracts were 
ambiguous and that parol evidence was admissible to explain the 
circumstances surrounding execution of the contracts, where the 
language within the contracts was "reasonably susceptible of the 
interpretation that the officers could be held personally liable" 
under the contracts. Id. at 474-75, 559 P.2d at 282-83. Similar 
to Hokama, it is not possible to determine the intended guarantor by looking only at the Guaranty itself. 
Additionally, the document is unclear as to what
 
default the Guaranty is intended to protect against. The circuit
 
court appears to have interpreted the document as a guaranty that
 
Radford would pay on promissory notes allegedly secured by the
 
referenced mortgages, but the promissory notes are not referenced
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or alluded to anywhere in the Guaranty. The intended default to
 
be addressed by the Guaranty is ambiguous.
 
Parol evidence submitted by the parties related to the
 
Tais' motion for partial summary judgment serves to further
 
establish that there are genuine issues of material fact. The
 
parties dispute whether Morris intended to be personally liable
 
under the Guaranty, and Morris even disputes she intended HPMC to
 
be liable for Radford's debt. Moreover, the August 9, 2006
 
mortgage adduced by both the Tais and Morris/HPMC (and which was
 
apparently referred to in the Guaranty), names HPMC (not the
 
Tais) as the "lender", which is inconsistent with the Guaranty. 
Although evidence was submitted to the effect that a promissory
 
note between Radford and HPMC was assigned to the Tais, there is
 
no evidence that the August 9, 2006 mortgage was assigned to the
 
Tais and, again, no reference was made to a promissory note in
 
the Guaranty. This creates issues of material fact as to the
 
purport of the Guaranty.
 
On a motion for summary judgment, "[a] fact is material 
if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or 
refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or 
defense asserted by the parties." Crichfield v. Grand Wailea 
Co., 93 Hawai' i 477, 482-83, 6 P.3d 349, 354-55 (2000) (quoting 
Hulsman v. Hemmeter Dev. Corp., 65 Haw. 58, 61, 647 P.2d 713, 716 
(1982)). "[A] 'genuine issue as to any material fact' . . . 
under a conflict in the affidavits as to a particular matter must 
be of such a nature that it would affect the result." Richards 
v. Midkiff, 48 Haw. 32, 39, 396 P.2d 49, 54 (1964).
 
In reviewing a circuit court's grant or denial of a 
motion for summary judgment, the appellate court "must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light 
most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Crichfield, 93 
Hawai'i at 483, 6 P.3d at 355. "[A]ny doubt concerning the 
propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the non-moving party." GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 79 Hawai' i 
516, 521, 904 P.2d 530, 535 (App. 1995). 
Therefore, because there are genuine issues of material 
fact, we vacate the partial summary judgment against Morris and 
HPMC. We also vacate the order awarding attorney's fees and 
costs to the Tais from Morris and HPMC. 
III. Conclusion
 
The July 28, 2011 Final Judgment and the July 28, 2011 
"Rule 54(b) Final Judgment on Count III: Breach of Guaranty of 
Verified Complaint against Defendants Tricia Morris and Herman-
Morris Enterprises, In., d.b.a. Hawai' i's Premiere Mortgage 
Company" both entered in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit are vacated and this case is remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
