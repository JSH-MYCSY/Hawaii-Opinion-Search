ROBIN BARTHOLOMEW, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(DISTRICT COURT SPECIAL PROCEEDING NO. 11-1-0002)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Robin Bartholomew ("Bartholomew")
 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief ("Order"), filed on
 July 22, 2011, in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Wailuku Division ("District Court").
1 On August 16, 2000,
 
Bartholomew was found guilty of Theft in the Third Degree, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 708-832 (1993)
 after pleading no contest to the charge. At the time of
 Bartholomew's conviction, Theft in the Third Degree was
 classified as a misdemeanor for which a defendant could be
 sentenced to a maximum of one year of imprisonment and a fine of
 $2,000. H
AW. REV. STAT. §§ 706-640 (Supp. 2012), - 663 (1993). 
During the colloquy that preceded the acceptance of his plea, the
 District Court incorrectly informed Bartholomew that the maximum
 penalty for Theft in the Third Degree was thirty days in jail and
 a fine of $1,000. Bartholomew was sentenced to one year of
 probation, ordered to pay a $50 criminal injury compensation fee,
 and required to complete forty hours of community service and a
 chemical-dependency program, as well as remain gainfully

employed. 
On appeal, Bartholomew contends that the District Court
 
erred in finding that Bartholomew's claims were patently
 
2
frivolous and without a trace of support in the record  because
(1) his nolo contendere plea was not made knowingly,
 
intelligently, and voluntarily because the District Court
 
3
misstated the maximum possible sentence  and (2) he did not
understand the nature of the charge and the consequences of the
 plea because the District Court did not inform him of the
 potential consequences associated with a plea made by someone who
 was not a United States citizen.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Bartholomew's points of error as follows:
 
(1) "[W]hen a defendant moves to withdraw a plea of
 
nolo contendere under HRPP 32(d) after imposition of sentence,
 only a showing of manifest injustice will entitle the defendant
 to withdraw his or her plea." State v. Nguyen, 81 Hawai' i 279, 
286, 916 P.2d 689, 696 (1996) (citing State v. Adams, 76 Hawai' i 
2
 Bartholomew incorporates the "patently frivolous and without a
trace of support in the record" language in a section entitled "Questions
Presented for Review," which proceeds then to summarize the earlier-identified
points of error. The language suggests that Bartholomew intends to argue that
the District Court erred in not providing him with an evidentiary hearing to
address his March 30, 2011 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment
("Petition"), but he makes no such argument. Therefore, we deem it to be
waived. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7).

 Bartholomew contends that he did not understand "the nature of the
 
charge," because "he was informed that consequences would be that of a petty
misdemeanor conviction when in fact the court adjudicated him guilty of a
misdemeanor." It is not clear whether Bartholomew means to contend that there
 were any consequences associated with the alleged misinformation beyond those
that arose from the erroneous explanation of the maximum possible sentence,
which we address below. If he does mean to suggest that there are other
consequences, he does not address them, and we deem the argument waived. Haw.
 R. App. P. 29(b)(7).

 Bartholomew's statement of points of error in the opening brief do
not comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b)(4).
As such, his points may be disregarded. Nevertheless, recognizing the Hawai' i 
appellate courts' policy of having appeals heard on the merits where possible,
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995), the
issues raised in Bartholomew's appeal will be analyzed and addressed to the
extent possible. Counsel is further warned about the need to comply with theformatting requirements contained in HRAP Rule 32(a). Future violations of the rule may result in the imposition of sanctions under HRAP Rule 30.

408, 411, 879 P.2d 513, 516 (1994)).5
 
A defendant must be informed of "the maximum penalty
 
provided by law, and the maximum sentence of any extended term of
 
imprisonment, which may be imposed for the offense to which the
 plea is offered[.]" Haw. R. Pen. P. 11(c)(2). Thus, the
 District Court erred by advising Bartholomew that the maximum
 penalty and term of imprisonment was less than the term provided
 for in HRS §§ 706-663 and 706-640. The error was harmless,
 however, because the District Court sentenced Bartholomew to less
 time than it had (erroneously) warned Bartholomew that he might
 receive; Bartholomew was given no jail time and not fined more
 than $1,000. See State v. Cornelio, 68 Haw. 644, 647, 727 P.2d
 
1125, 1127 (1986) (harmless error to inform defendant that
 maximum term of imprisonment was ten years when he pled no
 contest to a class A felony with a maximum term of twenty years
 but received a five-year term). Therefore, Bartholomew fails to
 show manifest injustice.
 
(2) Before accepting Bartholomew's no contest plea, and
 
as part of a more lengthy colloquy, the District Court asked,
 "Now, if you're not a citizen of the United States - - well, are
 you a citizen of the United States?" Bartholomew answered, "Yes,
 your Honor." Presumably because of that response, the District
 Court did not explain to Bartholomew that, were he a non-citizen,
 pleading to the offense for which he was charged "may have the
 consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the
 United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws
 of the United States." Haw. R. Pen. P. 11(c)(5).
 
Although the District Court erred in not completing the
 
colloquy, it was harmless under the circumstances. Bartholomew
 does not contend that any of the information excluded by the
 District Court was relevant to him; consequently, he demonstrates
 no prejudice. See People v. Delvillar, 922 N.E.2d 330, 337 (Ill.
 
2009) (U.S. citizens "face no immigration consequences as a
 result of entering a guilty plea"); cf. Cun-Lara v. State, 126
 
5
 We construe Bartholomew's Petition as a request to withdraw his
plea, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 32(d), which
directs that such relief, sought more than ten days after imposition of
sentence, may only be sought pursuant to HRPP Rule 40.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 541, 551, 273 P.3d 1227, 1237 (2012) (a defense attorney 
generally only need advise a non-citizen client that criminal 
charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences). Therefore, Bartholomew fails to show manifest injustice. 
Therefore, the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
and Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, filed on
 July 22, 2011 in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Wailuku Division, is affirmed.
