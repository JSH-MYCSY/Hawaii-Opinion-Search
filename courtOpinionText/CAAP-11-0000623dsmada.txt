(5) Cross-Appellants did not file the opening brief;
 
(6) from February, 2012, through July, 2012, orders of
 
this court that were conventionally served upon Cross-Appellants

 Postal Service as undeliverable, and Cross-Appellants had not
 informed the court of any alternative mailing address;
 
(7) a notice of default filed on August 9, 2012, which
 
the appellate clerk mailed to the same above-referenced address
 to Cross-Appellants, informed Cross-Appellants that: 
(a) the time for filing the opening brief expired; 
(b) pursuant to Rule 30 of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure, the matter would be called to the attention of the court on August 19, 2012 for such action as the court deems proper; and

(8) on August 27, 2012, the August 9, 2012 notice of

(9) thereafter, Cross-Appellants did not file the
 
opening brief, did not provide the court with any alternative
 mailing address, and did not seek further extensions for filing
 the opening brief or relief from the filing deadline. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the cross appeal of Cross-
Appellants is dismissed. The appeal of Appellant Dawn Whitney
 remains.
