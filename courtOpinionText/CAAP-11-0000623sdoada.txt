APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0087)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This case involves a complaint to quiet title and to
 
partition land located at Kanekiki, Kapoho, Island of Hawai 'i 
("Property"), filed by Plaintiff-Appellee Keahi Young, Trustee of
 
the Priscilla C. Young Trust ("Young"). Defendant-Appellant Dawn
 L. Whitney ("Whitney") appeals from the July 27, 2011 Final
 Judgment entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").
1
  
On appeal, Whitney asserts that the Circuit Court erred
 
by (1) "[d]enying [Whitney her] right to full and fair
 
1
 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
opportunity to defend all [her] interests in this case" and (2)
 
by failing to recognize an interest in a second generation of
 Kekuanuu's descendants despite a probate order's language stating
 that: "[I]t is declared that Kahailii, [Kekuanuu's] widow, has
 clear title to the [Property], while living, and for her
 descendants . . . , and their descendants thereafter, they will
 
2
all receive equal shares."  (Emphasis added.)
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Whitney's contention as follows:
 
(1) The Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") 
provide that service of a complaint is properly made upon a competent adult where "a copy of the summons and of the complaint [is delivered] to the individual personally or in case the individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein[.]" Haw. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1)(A). Service of pleadings and other papers is properly made if they are "mail[ed] . . . to the . . . party at the . . . party's last known address[.]" Haw. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(1)(b). "Service by mail is complete upon mailing." Haw.
 R. Civ. P. 5(b)(3).
 
"Parties who appear in person without counsel shall
 
notify the clerk in writing of their names, their mailing and
 residence addresses, and telephone numbers and shall keep the
 clerk informed by proper written notices of changes in the
 addresses and telephone numbers so given." Haw. R. Cir. Ct. 4. 
"A party who has been prejudiced by failure to receive due notice
 or to be served, or who has been prejudiced by reason that
 service was made by mail, may apply to the court for appropriate
 relief." Haw. R. Cir. Ct. 5(b).
 
2
 Whitney's opening brief does not specifically identify any points
of error. In fact, the brief fails in several respects to conform to the
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure. Nevertheless, we adhere to our policy
of affording pro se litigants their day in court, to the extent that we can
discern the arguments. See O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383,
386, 885 P.2d 361, 363 (1994).

On May 13, 2008, Whitney, along with Stephanie Atiz and 
several other defendants surnamed Whitney ("Whitney Defendants"), 
collectively filed their answer to the complaint ("Answer"), in which they asserted a lineal ownership interest in the Property. The Answer included a header with each of the Whitney Defendants' names, and immediately thereunder listed a single post office box address in Papaikou, Hawai
'i ("Papaikou Address"). As the 
Whitney Defendants appeared to provide the Papaikou Address as their collective address in the Answer, which Whitney signed, it was appropriate for the parties and the court to provide further service upon Whitney by mailing documents to that address. Haw. R. Civ. P. 4, 5; Haw. R. Cir. Ct. 4. 
On March 4, 2010, Young filed a motion for summary
 
judgment on the complaint. 
Whitney did not make an appearance at
 
any of the hearings on the motion. The order granting summary
 judgment was filed on October 11, 2010. Thereafter, Whitney
 filed a motion that she referred to as a motion to set aside the
 default judgment of October 11, 2010 which motion was denied.
 Whitney also filed a newly discovered evidence, HRCP Rule 60(b)
 motion for relief from summary judgment ("Rule 60(b) Motion"),
 which was also denied.
 
As Whitney did not provide any transcripts of
 
3
proceedings,  she cannot show that the Circuit Court failed to
determine whether she had been prejudiced or that it failed to afford her appropriate relief. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt
, 
80 Hawai 'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("The burden is 
upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted))). Moreover, it appears that, in determining Whitney's Rule 60(b) Motion, the Circuit Court reviewed Whitney's evidence purporting to establish her interest in the Property, and nevertheless denied her motion. 
3
 Whitney cites to an excerpt of a transcript in her opening brief,
but this transcript was not made part of the record. We therefore disregard
it. State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 455, 77 P.3d 940, 946 (2003)
("[Appellate courts] cannot consider evidence outside the record[.]").

(2) Whitney apparently contends that she acquired an
 
interest in the Property through one of Kekuanuu's and
 
Kahaialii's granddaughters. Whitney argues that the Circuit
 Court neglected certain language—"and their descendants
 thereafter"—in an 1865 order disposing of Kekuanuu's property
 interests, language which she contends thereby gave an interest
 not only to the children of Kukuanuu's widow, Kahaialii, but also
 to her grandchildren.
 
Whitney fails to offer any explanation or argument,
 
however, to support her position. In light of the common law
 practice of using such "words of inheritance" to clarify that a
 devise conveys a fee simple interest rather than a life estate,
4
 
5
and absent any argument to the contrary,  the Circuit Court did
not err in decling to interpret "and their descendants thereafter" as granting any interest in the grandchildren. Cf. 
Branca
, 13 Haw. at 505 (recognizing that specific words of 
inheritance, while "to be commended" for indicating a testator's intent to convey a fee simple estate, were not essential in Hawai
'i to finding and giving effect to such intent). 
Furthermore, to the extent that Whitney alleges error
 
in the Circuit Court's denial of her Rule 60(b) Motion, she did
 not proffer any new evidence to the Circuit Court in her motion. 
Rather, she offered only her interpretation of evidence that she
 admits in her opening brief had already been before the court. 
4
 At common law, while not then generally applicable in the Kingdom
of Hawai' i, such "words of inheritance" served to distinguish the devise of
fee estates from life estates. See, e.g., Branca v. Makuakane, 13 Haw. 499,
505 (1901) (ruling that the common law rule requiring a reference to a
devisee's "heirs" to accomplish the conveyance of a fee simple estate, ratherthan a life estate, was not in force in the Kingdom of Hawai' i prior to the
1893 statutory adoption of common law generally); see also In re Mangel's 
Estate, 186 N.W.2d 276, 277-78 (Wis. 1971) ("At common law, a devise to a
person and his heirs and assigns created an estate in fee simple. . . .Without the use of ['and to his heirs and assigns'], a general devise passedonly a life estate, unless an intention to pass a fee simple estate appeared
in the will."); 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estates § 19 (2011) ("The general and
well-established common-law rule was that words of inheritance, such as the
word 'heirs' or its equivalent, were necessary in a deed in order to convey anestate in fee simple to the grantee. At common law, a deed without words ofinheritance conveyed a life estate . . . ."). 
5
 It is by no means clear that any grandchild was even alive at the
time of probate.

Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in denying Whitney's
 
Rule 60(b) Motion.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 27, 2011
 
Final Judgment entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 is affirmed.
