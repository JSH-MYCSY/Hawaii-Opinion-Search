 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Reconsideration Of Order Denying Appellees Supplemental 
Memorandum Re: Jurisdiction for Quo Warranto Without Hearing 
filed herein on August 15, 2011." Judgment was entered in favor 
of Sierra Club and against Castle & Cooke, LUC, Office of 
Planning of the State of Hawai' i (State OP), the City and County 
of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting (City DPP), and the City and County of Honolulu Neighborhood Board No. 25 (City 
NB No. 25). 
I.
 
On October 15, 2010, LUC filed "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order" (Order) in Petition 
No. A07-775 (Petition), which (1) reclassified land within Castle 
& Cooke’s Koa Ridge Makai (Koa Ridge Makai), Increment 1, to the 
State Land Use Urban District, and (2) approved for incremental 
redistricting and conditional redistricting to State Land Use 
Urban District the land within the Castle & Cooke Wai' awa Project 
(Wai'awa Project), Increment 2. 
On November 10, 2010, Sierra Club filed an appeal in 
circuit court from LUC’s Order pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14 (1993 & Supp. 2010), HRS § 205-4(i) (2001 
Repl. & Supp. 2010), Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 15-15-93 
(2010), and Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 72. 
The parties submitted briefs to the circuit court. 
Oral argument was held July 19, 2011. The circuit court then
 
entered numerous pre-judgment orders.
 
On August 24, 2011, in anticipation of the circuit
 
court judgment, both Castle & Cooke and LUC filed notices of
 
appeal -- Castle & Cooke in No. CAAP-11-0000625 and LUC in No.
 
CAAP-11-0000627.
 
On October 5, 2011, the circuit court entered judgment
 
reversing LUC's October 15, 2010 order.
 
On October 7, 2011, Castle & Cooke filed another 
notice of appeal from the October 5, 2011 judgment in No.
 
CAAP-11-0000730. On October 12, 2011, LUC followed suit by

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filing another notice of appeal from the October 5, 2011 judgment
 
in CAAP-11-0000744.
 
On November 16, 2011, this court entered an Order of
 
Consolidation in No. CAAP-ll-0000625 that consolidated No.
 
CAAP-11-0000625, No. CAAP-11-0000627, No. CAAP-11-0000730, and
 
No. CAAP-11-0000744, under the single appellate court case No.
 
CAAP-11-0000625.
 
II.
 
This case originated from the Petition filed with LUC 
to reclassify approximately 767.649 acres of land from the 
Agricultural Land Use District to the Urban Land Use District for 
Koa Ridge Makai and Wai' awa Project. Prior to LUC’s approval of 
the Petition on an incremental basis, Sierra Club filed a Motion to Disqualify holdover Commissioner Duane Kanuha (Kanuha) on the 
basis that he failed to obtain Senate confirmation of his 
appointment to a second term. This motion was denied by LUC. 
LUC subsequently voted 7-1 to approve the Petition and later 
voted 6-0 to adopt the Order. Kanuha voted in favor of both 
approval of the Petition and adoption of the Order. 
Sierra Club appealed the Order to the circuit court on
 
the grounds that Kanuha was disqualified from serving on LUC as a
 
holdover member under HRS § 26-34 (2009 Repl.). In its "Order
 
Summarily Denying Appellees Supplemental Memorandum Re: 
Jurisdiction for Quo Warranto filed herein on July 29, 2011," the
 
circuit court agreed and ruled that Kanuha was therefore 
disqualified from voting on the contested boundary amendment, and
 
as a result, the Petition did not receive the necessary six
 
affirmative votes needed to pass.
 
III.
 
This appeal turns on the language of HRS § 26-34, which
 
provides:
 
§26-34 Selection and terms of members of boards and
 
commissions. (a) The members of each board and commission
established by law shall be nominated and, by and with the
advice and consent of the senate, appointed by the governor.
Unless otherwise provided by this chapter or by law
hereafter enacted, the terms of the members shall be for
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
four years; provided that the governor may reduce the terms
of those initially appointed so as to provide, as nearly as
can be, for the expiration of an equal number of terms at
intervals of one year for each board and commission. Unless
otherwise provided by law, each term shall commence on July
1 and expire on June 30, except that the terms of the
chairpersons of the board of agriculture, the board of land
and natural resources, and the Hawaiian homes commission
shall commence on January 1 and expire on December 31. No
person shall be appointed consecutively to more than two
terms as a member of the same board or commission; provided
that membership on any board or commission shall not exceed
eight consecutive years.
 
(b) Any member of a board or commission whose term has
expired and who is not disqualified for membership under
subsection (a) may continue in office as a holdover member
until a successor is nominated and appointed; provided that
a holdover member shall not hold office beyond the end of
the second regular legislative session following the
expiration of the member’s term of office. 
HRS § 26-34(a),(b) (emphasis added).
 
We must give effect to the plain language of 
HRS § 26-34(a):
 
Statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo by [the
appellate] court. When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention
of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from
the language contained in the statute itself. Moreover, it
is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that, where
the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit,
we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for a
different meaning. Instead, our sole duty is to give effect
to the statute's plain and obvious meaning.
 
Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in 
original omitted). 
The circuit court erroneously held that the Senate’s
 
failure to confirm Kanuha for a second term constituted a
 
disqualification under HRS § 26-34(a). HRS § 26-34(a) is clear
 
that the sole disqualification is that "[n]o person shall be
 
appointed consecutively to more than two terms as a member of the
 
same board or commission; provided that membership on any board
 
or commission shall not exceed eight consecutive years." 
Kanuha was not disqualified under HRS § 26-34(a) as he
 
had not been a commissioner appointed consecutively to more than
 
5
   
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
two terms as a member of LUC nor had his membership on LUC
 
exceeded eight consecutive years. Not obtaining Senate consent
 
to a second term did not a disqualify Kanuha from serving as a
 
holdover after the expiration of his first term.2 This was not a
 
disqualification under the plain language of HRS § 26-34(a). The
 circuit court erred in holding that Kanuha was not a valid
 
holdover for failure to obtain Senate confirmation for a second
 
term.

IV.
 
Therefore, the Final Judgment entered October 5, 2011
 
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is reversed.

 The Senate's rejection of Kanuha's appointment did not disqualify
Kanuha from serving as a holdover but did prevent him from serving
indefinitely given that the Governor would be required to make another
appointment within a reasonable period of time. Life of the Land v. Burns, 59
 
Haw. 244, 251, 580 P.2d 405, 410 (1978)

 Because Kanuha was a valid holdover, we need not address LUC's point
of error that the circuit court erred in holding six votes were necessary for
the ministerial act of approving LUC's decision as to form.
