APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1350)
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR DISMISSAL
 
WITH PREJUDICE OF THE APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of "Defendants-Appellants Hawaiian
 
Dredging Construction Company Inc., Fidelity & Deposit Company of
 
Maryland And Zurich American Insurance Company's Motion For
 Dismissal With Prejudice Of The Appeal" (Motion) filed October
 29, 2013, the papers in support, the records and files herein,
 and no objection having been filed, it appears that all parties
 to the underlying litigation have finalized and executed a global
 settlement agreement providing that, among other things, a
 dismissal of the claims in the underlying civil action would be
 forthcoming. 
It further appears that a "Stipulation And Order For
 
Dismissal Of All Remaining Claims And Parties" was filed October
 25, 2013 in the underlying civil action in the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
 
granted and this appeal is dismissed with prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, November 14, 2013.
