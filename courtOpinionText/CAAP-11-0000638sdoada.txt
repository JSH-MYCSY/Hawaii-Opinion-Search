NO. CAAP-11-0000638
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DAN MEZURASHI, Defendant-Appellee, and
EXODUS BAIL BOND, Real Party In Interest-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0336)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Real Party In Interest-Appellant Exodus Bail Bond
 
(Exodus) purports to appeal from the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit's (circuit court) July 29, 2011 Order Denying Motion for
 
Mitigation of Bail Forfeiture. It appears that Exodus's notice
 
of appeal is not valid, and thus we dismiss this appeal for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction.
 
On August 26, 2011, a notice of appeal was filed on
 
behalf of Exodus, with Exodus purporting to be the "Real-Party­
In-Interest, Pro se." It appears in public records that Exodus
 
is a limited liability company. An entity such as Exodus is not
 
allowed to appear and represent itself. See Oahu Plumbing &
 
Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 374, 590
 P.2d 570, 572 (1979).

Moreover, based on our review of the record and despite 
the fact that the signature block was styled as noted above, it 
appears that the notice of appeal was signed by Frank Fernandez. 
At the time the notice of appeal was filed, Frank Fernandez was 
not authorized to practice law. Specifically, on April 18, 2011 
(over four months before the notice of appeal was filed), the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court issued an Order of Interim Suspension 
suspending Frank Fernandez from the practice of law pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings. See SCAD-11-0000032. 
Subsequently, on February 14, 2013, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
filed an Order of Disbarment with respect to Frank Fernandez. 
See SCAD-12-0000376. An individual not authorized to practice 
law may not represent an entity such as Exodus. See Oahu 
Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd., 60 Haw. at 377, 590 P.2d at 573-74; Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 605-2 (1993 Repl.) and § 605-14 
(Supp. 2012).

Given the above, the notice of appeal filed on
 
August 26, 2011, is defective and invalid.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.

 We also note that on March 16, 2012, an opening brief was filed on
behalf of Exodus, which was signed by Janis Fernandez. It appears that Janis
Fernandez is not licensed to practice law in Hawai' i. Because she was not a 
licensed attorney, Janis Fernandez was not authorized to file briefs on behalfof Exodus in this appellate case. See Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd., 60
Haw. at 377, 590 P.2d at 573-74; HRS § 605-2 and § 605-14. Thus, the openingbrief was also invalid in this appeal.

Counsel.
