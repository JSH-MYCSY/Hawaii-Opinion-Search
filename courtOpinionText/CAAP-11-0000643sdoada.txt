NO. CAAP-11-0000643
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE INTEREST OF
 
D.T.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-J NO. 87911, REF. NO. I10-605)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant D.T. (Minor) appeals from the
 
following rulings of the Family Court of the Second Circuit1
 
(family court): (1) the May 10, 2011 "Findings of Facts and
 
Conclusions of Law; and Order Denying, in Part and Granting, in
 Part, Minor's Motion for Reconsideration" (Reconsideration
 Order); (2) the July 19, 2011 "Order Following a Contested
 Restitution Hearing on July 15, 2011" (Order Re: Restitution);
 and (3) the July 28, 2011 "Decree Re: Modification and Change of
 Law Violations Decree" (Decree Re: Modification).
 
On appeal, Minor raises the following points of error:
 
(1) the family court erred in awarding restitution because the
 State failed to prove what losses resulted from Minor's actions;
 and (2) the family court erred in failing to merge eight Burglary
 charges, seven Theft charges, and eight Criminal Property Damage
 charges into one charge each for Burglary, Theft, and Criminal

Property Damage because they arose out of the same continuing
 
course of conduct. With regard to his second point of error,
 Minor contends that Conclusions of Law (COL) 34, 35, and 44 in
 the Reconsideration Order are erroneous.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by Minor, as well as
 the relevant legal authority, we resolve Minor's points of error
 as follows:
 
(1) The family court ordered Minor to make restitution
 
in the amount of $2,545.40 for repairs to nine classroom door
 locks. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-48(11) (2006 Repl.)
 provides, in pertinent part, that the family court "may order any
 person adjudicated pursuant to section 571- 11(1) to make
 restitution of money or services to any victim who suffers loss
 as a result of the child's action[.]" Minor argues that the
 family court erred in awarding restitution without proof that the
 losses were caused by Minor's actions. 
In separate counts in the Petition, each relating to a
 
specific classroom, Minor was charged as a principal and/or
 accomplice of intentionally or knowingly damaging the "door, door
 handle, door knob, and/or locking mechanism" for ten classrooms
 (classrooms P-8, P-2, P-3, P-4, P-5, H-101, G-101, G-104, P-1,
 and I-102). After trial, the family court determined that the
 State had met its burden of proof as to eight counts of Criminal
 Property Damage relating to, respectively, classrooms P-8, P-2,
 P-3, P-4, P-5, H-101, G-101, G-104. The family court ruled that
 the State did not meet its burden of proof for the Criminal
 Property Damage charges alleged in counts 26 and 28, which relate
 to classrooms P-1 and I-102, respectively. 
On January 27, 2011, the family court initially ordered
 
restitution of $3,713.84. Subsequently, a contested restitution
 hearing was held on July 15, 2011, wherein the State submitted
 into evidence two invoices from the locksmith who repaired the
 doors. The first invoice (Invoice #1) shows repairs for ten
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
classrooms and twelve doors (two classrooms having two doors that
 
required repairs). The repairs reflected in Invoice #1 include
 the eight classrooms related to the Criminal Property Damage
 counts for which Minor was adjudicated a law violator (i.e., P-8,
 P-2, P-3, P-4, P-5, H-101, G-101, and G-104). The second invoice
 (Invoice #2) was for repairs to additional doors that were not
 included in the first invoice.
 
In the Order Re: Restitution, the family court reduced
 
the amount of restitution by omitting the charges from Invoice #2
 ($333.84), deducting the cost for three of the more expensive
 "Lever IC" classroom locks ($540.00) in Invoice #1, deducting
 labor for the three locks ($262.50), and deducting taxes on the
 costs deducted from Invoice #1 ($32.10). It appears that the
 three door locks removed from restitution correspond to "P-1: 1
 door and I-102: 2 doors" that, in turn, relate to the Criminal
 Property Damage charges in counts 26 and 28, which were
 dismissed. The family court thus reduced the restitution amount
 to cover nine doors in eight classrooms, resulting in the amount
 of $2,545.40. 
Minor argues on appeal that "[t]here is no way to
 
determine if the restitution award includes losses that did not
 result from [Minor's] actions." However, Minor does not
 challenge the family court's adjudication of him as a law
 violator for the eight Criminal Property Damage charges. 
Moreover, whether Minor was the principal or an accomplice in
 damaging the eight classroom doors, the loss was "a result of
 [Minor's] actions[.]" HRS § 571-48(11).
 
Restitution may thus be ordered for the damage as
 
alleged to each classroom identified in the Criminal Property
 Damage charges for which Minor was adjudicated. It appears that
 the family court relied upon Invoice #1 in ordering restitution
 for nine doors in the eight classrooms that Minor was found to
 have damaged. For the subject classrooms, invoice #1 reflects
 that each classroom had one door repaired, except classroom H-101
 had two doors repaired. We note, however, that the Petition in
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
count 19 only charged Minor with Criminal Property Damage to one
 
door for classroom H-101, and the family court's adjudication of
 Minor as a law violator for count 19 was based on the charge in
 the Petition. The family court thus erred in ordering
 restitution for damage to nine doors when Minor had been
 adjudicated for damage to eight doors.
 
The amount of restitution is therefore revised by 
subtracting the costs related to one door (i.e., the lock, labor,
 and tax), bringing the total restitution amount for repairing
 eight doors to $2,267.20.

(2) Minor argues that the family court erred by failing
 
to merge each set of charges for Burglary, Theft, and Criminal
 Property Damage into one offense for each type of charge. In
 particular, Minor relies upon HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (1993 Repl.),
 
which provides:
 
§701-109 Method of prosecution when conduct
establishes an element of more than one offense. (1) When
the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of
more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for
each offense of which such conduct is an element. The
 defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one
offense if:
 
. . .
 
(e)
	 The offense is defined as a continuing
course of conduct and the defendant's
 
course of conduct was uninterrupted,
unless the law provides that specific
periods of conduct constitute separate
offenses.
 
As expressed in  State v. Frisbee,  114 Hawai' i 76, 156 
P.3d 1182 (2007):
 
The statute "reflects a policy to limit the possibility of
multiple convictions and extended sentences when the
defendant has basically engaged in only one course of
criminal conduct directed at one criminal goal[.]" See
 
Commentary on HRS § 701–109.
 Whether a course of conduct gives rise to more than
one crime [within the meaning of HRS § 701–109(1)(e)]
depends in part on the intent and objective of the
 
2 This is calculated by subtracting the cost of one "Lever IC" lock
($180), labor for one lock ($87.50), tax on the lock and labor at 4% ($10.70)
from the family court's ordered amount of $2,545.40 for a total of $2,267.20.
$2,545.40 - (($180 + $87.50) x 1.04) = $2,267.20

defendant.  The test to determine whether the defendant
 
intended to commit more than one offense is whether
 
the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses
separate and distinct intents
. Where there is one
intention, one general impulse, and one plan, there is
but one offense. All factual issues involved in this
 determination must be decided by the trier of fact.
 
114 Hawai' i at 80-81, 156 P.3d at 1186-87 (underline emphasis 
added) (citations omitted) (block quote format altered). 
In this case, each Burglary count in the Petition 
alleged that Minor intentionally entered or remained unlawfully 
in a building and specifically identified a particular classroom; each Theft count alleged that Minor obtained or exerted unauthorized control over specified school property with intent to deprive the school of the property; and each Criminal Property Damage count alleged that Minor intentionally or knowingly damaged school property in specifically identified classrooms. The family court, as the trier of fact, determined that the State had met its burden of proof as to eight counts of Burglary, seven counts of Theft, and eight counts of Criminal Property Damage. The family court, as trier of fact, thus determined that Minor had distinct intents as to each count. Minor does not challenge the family court's findings and unchallenged findings of fact are binding on appeal. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 537, 280 
P.3d 88, 135 (2012). Moreover, in denying Minor's motion for reconsideration as to the merger issue, the family court properly recognized that factual issues related to merger must be decided by the trier of fact. 
As trier of fact, it was within the family court's
 
purview to determine if Minor intended to commit more than one
 offense of Burglary, Theft and Criminal Property Damage. Minor
 has not challenged the family court's findings in this regard.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the May 10, 2011 "Findings of
 
Facts and Conclusions of Law; Order Denying, in Part and
 Granting, in Part, Minor's Motion for Reconsideration" is
 affirmed. The "Decree Re: Modification and Change of Law

Violations Decree" entered July 28, 2011 and the "Order Following
 
a Contested Restitution Hearing on July 15, 2011" are revised to
 order restitution in the amount of $2,267.20, but in all other
 respects are affirmed.
