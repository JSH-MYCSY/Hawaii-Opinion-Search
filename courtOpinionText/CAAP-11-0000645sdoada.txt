OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
VICTOR F. MULU, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-1218)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Victor F. Mulu ("Mulu") appeals 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence; Notice of 
Entry, filed on August 16, 2011, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1 On July 29, 2010, Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai 'i ("State") entered a Felony Information 
against Mulu, charging him with Assault in the Second Degree "in violation of Section 707-711(1)(a) and/or Section 707-711(1)(b) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes [("HRS")]."
2 On June 6, 2011, 
Mulu was convicted by a jury of Assault in the Second Degree in 
1/ The Honorable Michael D. Wilson presided. 
2/ HRS § 707-711(1) provides, in relevant part: 
Assault in the second degree.  (1) A person commits
the offense of assault in the second degree if: 
(a) The person intentionally or knowingly causes
substantial bodily injury to another; 
(b) The person recklessly causes serious orsubstantial bodily injury to another[.]
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707-711(1)(a) and (b) (2013).
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
violation of HRS § 707-711(1)(b), and on August 16, 2011, was
 
sentenced to five years of probation, six months of concurrent
 imprisonment, and restitution and crime victim compensation fees
 totaling $1,908.16. 
On appeal, Mulu contends that the Circuit Court
 
erroneously: (1) denied his motion in limine to exclude medical
 and related testimony; (2) denied his motion for judgment of
 acquittal; (3) instructed the jury as to the charged offense; (4)
 convicted him upon insufficient evidence; and (5) "sentenc[ed]
 [him] to jail and . . . impos[ed] extreme conditions."

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mulu's points of error as follows and affirm:
 
(1) The general rule is that "[a] party is not required 
to accept a judicial admission of his adversary, but may insist on proving the fact." Parr v. United States, 255 F.2d 86, 88 
(5th Cir. 1958) (quoting 31 C.J.S. Evidence § 542). While parties may stipulate as to certain facts, this requires an acceptance by both parties as to the stipulation and the filing of a formal agreement with the court. See State v. Rivera, No. 
30080, 2012 WL 5831177, at *1-2 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2012). A party's unilateral concession of facts does not remove the State's ability to prove those facts with the evidence available. See State v. Edwards, 81 Hawai
'i 293, 298, 916 P.2d 703, 708 
(1996) (holding that photographs of a corpse were relevant and probative despite defendant's offer to concede to the nature and manner of the murder). 
Nothing in the record indicates that the State ever
 
accepted Mulu's offer to stipulate to substantial bodily injury. 
No stipulation or agreement was ever filed with the Circuit
 Court. In fact, the State repeatedly expressed an interest in
 calling Dr. Vincent Nip as a witness.
 
3/
 Mulu's second and fourth points of error contend that evidence
related to Mulu's identification was insufficient. Therefore, we address the
two points together.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
State v. Murray, 116 Hawai 'i 3, 16, 169 P.3d 955, 968 
(2007) does not require anything to the contrary. In Murray, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court adopted "an approach specifically 
concerning the use of prior convictions to prove an element of a charged offense." Id. at 19, 169 P.3d at 972 (emphasis added.) 
Here, Mulu offered to stipulate to substantial bodily injury, not to prior convictions. Therefore, Murray did not restrict the prosecution from introducing medical testimony to establish the extent of the injury. 
Dr. Nip's testimony consisted of medical and injury 
evidence establishing the complaining witness's ("CW") injuries and the possibility that they could have been caused by a punch. The testimony did not go into unnecessary or gruesome details. Similar evidence has previously been found not to be unfairly prejudicial. See, e.g., Edwards, 81 Hawai
'i at 296-300, 916 P.2d 
at 706-710. Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mulu's motion in limine to exclude Dr. Nip's testimony. 
(2) When an appellate court examines a motion for 
judgment of acquittal it must look "upon the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact, [to decide if] a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." State v. Pudiquet, 82 Hawai
'i 419, 423, 922 P.2d 1032, 
1036 (App. 1996) (quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai 'i 262, 265, 892 
P.2d 455, 458 (1995)). "Substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." State v. 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai
'i 87, 99, 997 P.2d 13, 25 (2000) (quoting State 
v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai 'i 108, 112-13, 952 P.2d 865, 869-70 (1997)). 
"[I]t is the province of the trier of fact, and not the appellate court, to determine the credibility of witnesses and to assess the weight and effect of the evidence adduced at trial." State 
v. Aplaca, 96 Hawai
'i 17, 23, 25 P.3d 792, 798 (2001) (citing 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai 'i at 101, 997 P.2d at 27).

The State produced evidence through the testimony of CW 
and an eyewitness that a man wearing a white t-shirt and with 
cornrows ran up and punched CW in the face. Mulu himself testified to wearing a white t-shirt and having cornrows the night of the incident. CW identified Mulu to a police officer as the man who had punched him. The State also produced evidence through the testimony of CW and Dr. Nip that CW suffered orbital bone fractures. Accordingly, the record is not devoid of substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that Mulu recklessly inflicted CW's injury. That there was conflicting testimony is of no benefit to Mulu because evaluating the credibility of witnesses is the province of the finder of fact, and not this court. State v. Bailey, 126 Hawai
'i 383, 405, 271 
P.3d 1142, 1164 (2012) (quoting State v. Kaleohano, 99 Hawai 'i 
370, 376, 56 P.3d 138, 144 (2002)). 
When viewed in the light most favorable to the
 
prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier
 of fact, the State produced sufficient evidence of probative
 value to support a prima facie case to enable a person of
 reasonable caution to support a conclusion that Mulu recklessly
 caused substantial bodily injury to CW. Therefore, the Circuit
 Court did not err in denying Mulu's motions for judgment of
 acquittal.
 
(3) An alleged instructional error "is not to be viewed 
in isolation and considered purely in the abstract. It must be examined in the light of the entire proceedings and given the effect which the whole record shows it to be entitled." State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai
'i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) (quoting 
State v. Gonsalves, 108 Hawai 'i 289, 293, 119 P.3d 597, 601 
(2005)). "The real question becomes whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to conviction." Id. (quoting Gonsalves, 108 Hawai
'i at 289, 119 
P.3d at 601). 
The Circuit Court explained that Mulu had been "charged
 
with one offense that is alleged to have been committed two
 different ways. Put differently, the Complaint charges
 alternative methods of proving the single offense of Assault in
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Second Degree." With respect to the second alternative, the
 
Circuit Court first explained that "a person commits the offense
 of Assault in the Second Degree if he recklessly causes bodily
 injury to another person." The qualifier "substantial" should
 have been inserted before the word "bodily," but was omitted from
 this portion of the instruction. Neither Mulu nor the State
 objected to the omission. 
The Circuit Court subsequently explained the elements
 
of each alternative and correctly included the word "substantial"
 before the phrase "bodily injury." The Circuit Court then read
 the instruction regarding the special interrogatory identifying
 the second alternative, and in doing so again read "substantial"
 before "bodily injury." The Circuit Court further instructed
 that: "'substantial bodily injury' means . . . a bone
 fracture[.]"
 
In addition to the multiple oral recitations of the
 
"substantial bodily injury" standard, the written instructions
 provided to the jury prior to the oral instructions included the
 word "substantial" before "bodily injury."
4 Thus, the word
 
"substantial" preceded "bodily injury" in every instance of the
 oral and written jury instructions except for the single
 identified omission.
 
Even as they considered their verdict, the jurors were
 
confronted with the requirement that "substantial bodily injury"
 must be proven. The verdict form signed by the jury foreperson
 and returned to the Circuit Court included the word "substantial"
 before "bodily injury." Further, the clerk of court included the
 word "substantial" before "bodily injury" when announcing the
 jury's verdict. The Circuit Court's poll of the jurors revealed
 each juror's agreement with the verdict as announced. 
We conclude that, taken as a whole, there is no
 
reasonable possibility that the Circuit Court's single omission
 of the word "substantial" in but one of several oral instructions
 
4/
 Although "a written copy of the court's instructions cannot serve
as a substitute for an oral charge," State v. Iosefa, 77 Hawai' i 177, 184, 880
P.2d 1224, 1231 (App. 1994), the written instructions ensure that the jury
"could not, therefore, have been led far afield by the [C]ircuit [C]ourt's
minor omission." State v. Staley, 91 Hawai' i 275, 285, 982 P.2d 904, 914
(1999).

to the jury might have contributed to Mulu's conviction when
 
"substantial" was used in all other instances and was
 subsequently confirmed by the jury. Therefore, any error
 committed was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and the Circuit
 Court's judgment of conviction will not be set aside. 
To the extent that Mulu contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in presenting two alternatives to the jury by which assault in the second degree might be proven, Hawai
'i law provides for 
the two alternatives, H AW. REV. STAT. 707-711(1), and the court's 
instruction merely reflected the charge.5 Jury instructions 
involving alternative means of establishing the mens rea of an offense comport with due process. State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai
'i 
577, 589, 994 P.2d 509, 521 (2000). The jury verdict reflects no confusion between the two alternatives, with the jury confirming that it had unanimously found that "the Defendant recklessly caused substantial bodily injury to [CW]." Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in providing the two alternatives to the jury. 
(4) For felonies, "the length of the sentence actually 
imposed is a matter of legislative prerogative and the judiciary should not interfere except in extreme cases." State v. Kido, 3 
Haw. App. 516, 530, 654 P.2d 1351, 1360-61 (1982). Assault in the second degree is a Class C felony. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707­
711(2). Hawai 'i law authorizes a prison term of up to five years 
for the felony that Mulu was found to have committed. H AW. REV. 
STAT. § 706-660 (Supp. 2013).  Therefore, the Circuit Court did 
not abuse its discretion by sentencing Mulu to a six-month term of imprisonment as part of his sentence. 
Mulu does not substantiate his claim that the
 
conditions of his sentence are cruel and unusual. We find
 nothing in the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the
 sentence "so disproportionate to the conduct proscribed and . . .
 of such duration as to shock the conscience of reasonable persons
 
5/
 Mulu further contends that "[o]n top of these breathtaking
alternatives, the Circuit Court added a special interrogatory[,]" but fails to
explain how doing so contributed to the alleged inconsistent and misleading
nature of the instructions. Therefore, we deem the argument waived. Haw. R.
 App. P. 28(b)(7).

or outrage the moral sense of the community." State v. Loa, 83 
Hawai'i 335, 357, 926 P.2d 1258, 1280 (1996) (quoting State v. 
Kumukau, 71 Haw. 218, 226–27, 787 P.2d 682, 687 (1990)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted); see also Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 
289–90 (1983) ("outside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences will be exceedingly rare" (brackets omitted) (quoting Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 272 (1980))). Accordingly, the terms of Mulu's sentence are within constitutional limits. 
Therefore, the Judgment of Conviction and Probation
 
Sentence; Notice of Entry, filed on August 16, 2011 in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
