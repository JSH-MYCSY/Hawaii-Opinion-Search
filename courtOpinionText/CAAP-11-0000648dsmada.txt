jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal and cross-appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000648 from the Honorable Edwin C. Nacino's August 5, 2011 judgment, because the August 5, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to case upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
A judgment that does not specifically identify the claim or 
claims on which a circuit court intends to enter judgment requires an appellate court to search the often voluminous record on appeal in order to determine the specific claim or claims on which judgment is entered. As the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
explained, "we should not make such searches necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although the various parties have asserted multiple
 
causes of action through Appellant Etzrodt's October 27, 2009
 complaint (asserting three separate causes of action) and Cross-
Appellant PACBLU's December 9, 2009 amended answer and
 counterclaim (asserting three separate causes of action), the
 August 5, 2011 judgment does not specifically identify the claim
 or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment in
 each instance, nor does the August 5, 2011 judgment expressly
 dismiss any specifically identified claim or claims. Therefore,
 the August 5, 2011 judgment is too vague to satisfy requirements
 for an appealable judgment in a multiple-claim case under HRCP
 Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins.
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Absent the entry of an appealable final judgment, the
 
appeal and cross-appeal are premature, and we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction over the appellate court case number CAAP-11­0000648. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal and cross-appeal
 
in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000648 are dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
