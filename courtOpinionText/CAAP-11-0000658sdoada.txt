IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
' OF THE STATE OF HAWAII 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MARWAN TIMOTHY SAAD JACKSON, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 06-1-0045)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Marwan Timothy Saad Jackson
 
(Jackson) appeals from the August 16, 2011 judgment of the
 
1
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  (circuit court), convicting
Jackson of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-702 (Count I)
 
and of violating an order of protection in violation of
 
HRS ยง 586-11 (Count IV).
 
On appeal, Jackson contends that he had ineffective
 
assistance of counsel. 
Jackson claims his trial counsel rendered
 
ineffective assistance by failing to properly counter the State's
 expert medical witness when counsel: (1) failed to hire a defense
 
medical expert, (2) failed to consult with a medical expert prior

to cross-examining the State's expert witness, (3) failed to ask
 
the State's medical expert about alternative explanations for the
 
decedent's injuries, and (4) misstated in closing arguments that
 
the medical examiner concluded that the decedent could not have
 
died from a fall.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised therein, we resolve
 
Jackson's appeal as follows:
 
To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a 
defendant is required to prove not only that there were "specific 
errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, 
or diligence[,]" but also that "such errors or omissions resulted 
in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potential 
meritorious defense." State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 516, 
78 P.3d 317, 329 (2003) (citation omitted). Jackson has not met this burden of proof. 
To the extent that Jackson argues defense counsel 
provided ineffective assistance by failing to obtain a medical 
expert, the claim fails because Jackson has not provided any 
information as to the testimony such a medical expert would have 
provided. It is well-established that "[i]neffective assistance 
of counsel claims based on the failure to obtain witnesses must 
be supported by affidavits or sworn statements describing the 
testimony of the proffered witnesses." State v. Richie, 88 
Hawai'i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (emphasis added). See 
also State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 481, 946 P.2d 32, 51 
(1997); State v. Reed, 77 Hawai' i 72, 84, 881 P.2d 1218, 1230 
(1994) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Balanza, 93 
Hawai'i 279, 1 P.3d 281 (2000)); State v. Aplaca, 74 Hawai' i 54, 
68-69, 837 P.2d 1298, 1306 (1992). In his Opening Brief, Jackson relies merely on his own speculation as to what favorable

testimony a medical expert could have provided. Hawai' i 
precedent is clear that this is insufficient support for an 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on failure to 
obtain a witness. 
To the extent Jackson argues that an expert should have 
been consulted, Jackson also fails to produce any evidence 
supporting this argument. Although Jackson provides speculative 
arguments about how consultation with a medical expert would have 
been beneficial, there is no actual evidence or information as to 
what a consultant would have done, given the circumstances of the 
case. Cf. Reed, 77 Hawai' i at 84, 881 P.2d at 1230; State v. 
Montalbo, 73 Haw. 130, 146, 838 P.2d 1274, 1283 (1992). 
To the extent that Jackson argues that defense 
counsel's assistance was ineffective due to counsel's failure to question the State's expert witness, Kanthi De Alwis, M.D. 
(Dr. De Alwis), in regards to whether injuries to the decedent's 
head could have been caused by falling, Jackson fails to 
demonstrate that counsel lacked skill, judgment, or diligence or 
that such questions would have bolstered a meritorious defense. 
Indeed, given the direct testimony by Dr. De Alwis, that the 
decedent died from injuries to her head and brain and that 
certain significant injuries could not have been caused by a 
fall, further questions on cross-examination as Jackson now 
asserts could have further underlined for the jury that Jackson's 
defense theory was unmeritorious. Cf. State v. Silva, 75 Hawai' i 
419, 440-41, 864 P.2d 583, 593 (1993). 
To the extent that Jackson alleges that defense
 
counsel's characterization of Dr. De Alwis's testimony during
 closing arguments substantially impaired his defense, Jackson
 
fails to demonstrate that counsel's characterization constitutes
 
ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the overall testimony
 
by Dr. De Alwis, defense counsel's characterization of her

testimony was not unfounded. Further, Jackson fails to 
demonstrate that counsel's statement was the result of something 
other than tactical decision-making. It is well established in 
Hawai'i that "'defense counsel's tactical decisions at trial 
generally will not be questioned by a reviewing court.'" Silva, 
75 Hawai' i at 441, 864 P.2d at 593 (brackets omitted) (quoting 
State v. Antone, 62 Hawai' i 346, 352, 615 P.2d 101, 106 (1980)). 
It is also understood that, "[l]awyers require and are permitted 
broad latitude to make on-the-spot strategic choices in the 
course of trying a case." Silva, 75 Hawai' i at 441, 864 P.2d at 
593. 
Given that defense counsel did not merely concede that
 
a fall could not have caused the decedent's injuries, but rather
 went on to argue that multiple falls could explain the injuries,
 
the statement can reasonably be viewed as a tactical decision to
 
address Dr. De Alwis's testimony. Therefore, it does not amount
 
to ineffective assistance of counsel. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 16, 2011 judgment 
of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
