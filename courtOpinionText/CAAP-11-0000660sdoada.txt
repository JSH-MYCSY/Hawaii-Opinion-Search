SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sylvia Cabral (Cabral) appeals from
 
the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment Against Defendant Sylvia
 Cabral and Summary Judgment Against Defendants Palisade Pointe
 Estates, Inc. and Wilmer A. Ayers and for Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure Filed June 15, 2011" (Judgment) entered on
 October 25, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 (circuit court).
1 The Judgment granted a decree of foreclosure
 
in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Great American Hotels and Resorts,
 Inc. (GAHR) and entered default judgment against Cabral. As part
 of her appeal, Cabral also challenges the circuit court's "Order

 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Denying Defendant Sylvia Cabral's Motion to Set Aside Default
 
Filed June 28, 2011" entered on September 26, 2011.
 
As best as can be discerned, Cabral raises the
 
following points in her appeal: 1) the circuit court's findings
 of fact contain errors and/or inaccuracies; 2) the court erred by
 denying her motion to set aside entry of default a) by not
 finding excusable neglect or attorney negligence and b) because
 she presented a meritorious defense; 3) the presiding judge was
 biased; and 4) her due process rights were violated. Cabral also
 raises various legal malpractice and improper conduct claims, and
 contract claims.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the applicable law, we resolve Cabral's points of error
 as follows:
 
(1) On appeal, Cabral refers in general terms to 
"[s]ignificant errors in the Findings of Fact," and general "inaccuracies[;]" however, she fails to point to specific findings of fact that she challenges. A review of the record indicates that the circuit court's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. Therefore, Cabral's point of error related to the circuit court's findings of fact is disregarded. See Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)(C); Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 135, 839 P.2d 10, 35 (1992) ("Alleged error in findings of fact not expressly challenged on appeal will be disregarded in the absence of plain error.") 
(2) We review the circuit court's denial of Cabral's 
"Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default entered Nov. 23, 2010" (Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default) for abuse of discretion. Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Hawai
'i, Ltd., 100 Hawai 'i 149, 
158, 58 P.3d 1196, 1205 (2002). "Generally, to constitute an abuse of discretion, it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant." Tri-S Corp. v. W. World Ins. Co., 110 Hawai 'i 473, 
489, 135 P.3d 82, 98 (2006) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by
 
denying Cabral's Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default. Nor did
 the circuit court abuse its discretion when it entered default
 judgment against Cabral in the Judgment. 
Cabral had previously failed to answer GAHR's complaint
 
for foreclosure. In her Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default,
 Cabral's argument was limited to assertions that the entry of
 default was the result of her attorney's failures, which
 constituted excusable neglect. In subsequent filings, Cabral
 additionally alleged, inter alia, that the mortgages on the
 subject property were fraudulently obtained and that she was the
 rightful owner of the property. 
Under Hawai
'i case law, entry of default or a default 
judgment can be set aside when the defaulting party shows 
(1) that the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by
the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a
meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not the
result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.
 
BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150
 
(1976) (emphasis added).
 
The circuit court determined that Cabral had failed to
 
show she had a meritorious defense to GAHR's complaint given that
 Cabral's claims to the subject Property, if any, are junior to
 GAHR's claims. We conclude the circuit court did not abuse its
 discretion in denying Cabral's Motion to Set Aside Entry of
 Default and in entering default judgment.
 
The circuit court properly determined that Cabral did
 
not show she had a meritorious defense. Cabral did not provide
 any meaningful showing that she is the rightful owner of the
 property or that her claims to the property are superior to
 GAHR's claims to the property. Cabral's allegations of fraud
 also did not set out the circumstances of the fraud with any
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
particularity. See Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 9(b) 
("In all averments of fraud . . ., the circumstances constituting 
fraud [] shall be stated with particularity."); Larsen v. Pacesetter Sys., Inc., 74 Haw. 1, 30-31, 837 P.2d 1273, 1288 (1992) (explaining that a party's fraud allegations must include who made the false representations and specify the representations made). Cabral's primary assertion in the circuit court, that the default was the result of her attorney's neglect, did not assist in establishing that she has a meritorious defense. 
We need not address the two other prongs of the BDM 
test because the test requires that all three prongs be satisfied. See Long v. Long, 101 Hawai
'i 400, 404, 69 P.3d 528, 
532 (App. 2003) ("If any one of [the] three prongs [of the BDM test] is not shown by the defaulting party, the trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to set aside the default judgment."). 
(3) Cabral has not met her burden to show that the
 
presiding judge was biased.
 
In Aga v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai
'i 230, 891 P.2d 1022 
(1995), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated that 
in the administration of justice by a court of law, no
principle is better recognized as absolutely essential than
that in every case, be it criminal or civil, the parties
involved therein are entitled to the cold neutrality of an
impartial judge. The right of litigants to a fair trial
must be scrupulously guarded.
 
Id. at 242, 891 P.2d at 1034 (brackets and ellipsis omitted)
 
(quoting Peters v. Jamieson, 48 Haw. 247, 262, 397 P.2d 575, 585
 (1964)). "[R]eversal on the grounds of judicial bias or
 misconduct is warranted only upon a showing that the trial was
 unfair. Unfairness, in turn, requires a clear and precise
 demonstration of prejudice." Id. (citations omitted).
 
In this case, the circuit court's ruling was well
 
grounded in law and fact. See id. As discussed above, under
 
BDM, 57 Haw. at 76, 549 P.2d at 1150, a defaulting party must
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
demonstrate that he or she has a meritorious defense, and Cabral
 
failed to make such a showing.
 
4) 
Procedural due process "requires notice and an 
opportunity to be heard . . . ." State v. Bani
, 97 Hawai 'i 285, 
293, 36 P.3d 1255, 1263 (2001). A review of the record indicates that Cabral had notice of the action and an opportunity to be heard. For instance, Cabral was served with GAHR's complaint, filed her motion to set aside entry of default, appeared at hearings, and was afforded an opportunity to speak. 
5)
 Cabral's claims related to legal malpractice and

 
other improper conduct allegedly committed by both her attorney
 and other attorneys involved in this case, as well as her
 contract claims, are beyond the scope of this appeal. Therefore,
 we do not address those issues.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of

 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 for Default Judgment Against Defendant Sylvia Cabral and Summary
 Judgment Against Defendants Palisade Pointe Estates, Inc. and
 Wilmer A. Ayers and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure filed

 Defendant Sylvia Cabral's Motion to Set Aside Default Filed
 June 28, 2011" entered on September 26, 2011, in the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit, are affirmed.
