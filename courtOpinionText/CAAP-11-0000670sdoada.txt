Consistent with his plea agreement and Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 11(e)(1), the Circuit Court sentenced 
Cantrell to (1) concurrent terms of twenty years for Counts I-V, 
VII, and VIII and (2) concurrent terms of ten years for Count IX, 
and five years for Counts VI and X, to be served consecutively to 
the twenty-year terms, for a total of thirty years incarceration.

Cantrell presents three points  on appeal:  (1) the
 
Circuit Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty
 
plea and to continue sentencing, (2) there was no undue delay in
 
the filing of this motion, and (3) the State did not meet its
 
burden to prove that it relied on his plea to its substantial
 
prejudice.
 
With regard to his first point, Cantrell argues that 
the "coercive, pressure-laden circumstance" he was placed in 
leading up to his plea renders it involuntary. 
Given the 
procedural posture of this case, Cantrell was required to show only that there was "a fair and just reason" to withdraw his 
plea. State v. Topasna, 94 Hawai' i 444, 451, 16 P.3d 849, 856 
(App. 2000) (citation omitted). 
However, while counsel submitted his own declaration
 
with the motion, there was none from Cantrell and at the hearing
 on his motion to withdraw, Cantrell offered no evidence and did
 
not testify in his own behalf. On appeal, he offers no authority
 
supporting his position that the circumstances he cites, even if
 
true, made his plea involuntary. Cantrell admits that in
 
"reading the transcript of the Defendant's change of plea one
 
finds no discernable error." Despite the fact that the colloquy

met the requirements of HRPP Rule 11(c),  Cantrell argues on
2
 We note that Cantrell's points on appeal are in violation of
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). Counsel is warned 
that future violations may result in sanctions. HRAP Rule 30.

 HRPP Rule 11(c) provides in pertinent part that a court:
 
shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without
first addressing the defendant personally in open court and
determining:
 
(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is
offered; and
 
(continued...)

appeal that his responses did not reflect his true beliefs at the
 
time. Our review of the change of plea colloquy supports the
 
denial of Cantrell's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. See
 
U.S. v. Lambey, 974 F.2d 1389, 1395 (4th Cir. 1992) ("Statements
 of fact by a defendant in Rule 11 proceedings may not ordinarily
 
be repudiated, and, similarly, findings by a sentencing court in
 
accepting a plea 'constitute a formidable barrier' to attacking
 
the plea.") (citation omitted).
 
Because there was no "fair and just" reason to allow 
Cantrell to withdraw his pleas, we need not address the remaining 
factors. See State v. Merino, 81 Hawai' i 198, 224, 915 P.2d 672, 
698 (1996) (absent any of the three factors, the trial court may, without abusing its discretion, refuse to permit the defendant to 
withdraw the plea); U.S. v. Nichols, 986 F.2d 1199, 1201 (8th 
Cir. 1993). 
Therefore, the July 12, 2011 Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 
affirmed.

(2) the maximum penalty provided by law, and the
maximum sentence of extended term of imprisonment,
which may be imposed for the offense to which the plea
is offered; and
 
(3) that the defendant has the right to plead not
guilty, or to persist in that plea if it has already
been made; and
 
(4) that if the defendant pleads guilty or nolo
contendere there will not be a further trial of any
kind, so that by pleading guilty or nolo contendere
the right to a trial is waived[.]
