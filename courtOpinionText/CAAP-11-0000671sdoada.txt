I.
 
On August 11, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellee Shakir Gangjee
 
(Gangjee) filed a complaint against Tutor, seeking $13,117.92 for
 
"unpaid wages, loans, expenses, and interest charges[.]" The
 complaint was served on Tutor through its President, Robert S.
 Allen (Allen). Because Tutor was a corporation, it could only
 appear in court and represent itself through a licensed attorney. 
Oahu Plumbing and Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60
 Haw. 372, 374-75, 590 P.2d 570, 572-73 (1979). At the return
 hearing held on August 23, 2010, Allen appeared, but no counsel
 appeared on behalf of Tutor. The District Court continued the
 case for a pretrial conference on December 20, 2010. The minutes
 for the return hearing indicate that the District Court advised
 Allen that Tutor must be represented by counsel at the next court
 date.
 
On November 30, 2010, Gangjee filed a motion for
 
summary judgment, which was scheduled for a hearing on December
 13, 2010. On December 6, 2010, Allen submitted a motion to
 continue the hearing on Gangjee's summary judgment motion. 
Allen asserted that he had been off island on business and needed
 more time to secure counsel. On December 7, 2010, the District
 Court granted the motion for continuance and moved the hearing on
 Gangjee's summary judgment motion to February 4, 2011.
 
On December 20, 2010, the District Court held a
 
pretrial conference. Gangjee appeared through counsel, but Tutor
 did not appear. The District Court ordered the entry of default
 against Tutor. On December 27, 2010, Gangjee submitted a non-
hearing motion for default judgment, and on December 30, 2010,
 Gangjee submitted a corrected non-hearing motion for default
 judgment. Both documents were served on Tutor by mail. On
 December 30, 2010, Allen filed a response to the initial motion
 for default judgment. Allen asserted that he mistakenly believed
 that a continuance had been granted for both the motion for
 summary judgment and the pretrial conference. On January 24,

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2011, the District Court entered a default Judgment in favor of
 
Gangjee and against Tutor in the total amount of $17,313,53.
 
Tutor, who still had not appeared through counsel, did
 
not appeal the Judgment. From February 18, 2011, through March
 24, 2011, Gangjee actively pursued collection on the Judgment
 through garnishment. On April 4, 2011, Tutor, through counsel,
 filed a Motion to Dissolve the Issuance of Garnishment and for
 Return of Funds Garnished or, in the Alternative, Motion to Set
 Aside Default Judgment and Quash the Issuance of Garnishment and
 for Return of Funds Garnished (Motion to Set Aside Default
 Judgment). Gangjee filed an opposition to the Motion to Set
 Aside Default Judgment. On June 8, 2011, the District Court
 filed an order denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside Default
 Judgment.
 
On August 8, 2011, Tutor submitted a motion for
 
reconsideration of the District Court's order denying Tutor's
 Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, which the District Court
 denied on August 12, 2011.
 
II.
 
On appeal, Tutor contends that the District Court erred
 
in: (1) denying Tutor's motion for reconsideration of the
 District Court's order denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside
 Default Judgment; and (2) denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside
 Default Judgment.
2
 
The procedural posture of this case is that Tutor is
 
appealing from the last order in a series of appealable
 decisions: (1) the January 24, 2011, Judgment; (2) the June 8,
 2011, order denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment;
 and (3) the August 12, 2011, Order Denying Tutor's Motion for
 
2
 Tutor's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellant
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(1) (2010) in several significant respects,
including: (1) its statement of the case fails to contain record references;(2) its statement of points of error fails to identify where in the record the
alleged error occurred and was objected to or brought to the attention of the
District Court; and (3) there is no statement of related cases. Counsel for
 Tutor is warned that future noncompliance with the HRAP may result in
sanctions against him.

Reconsideration of the Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Default
 
Judgment. Tutor did not appeal from the January 24, 2011,
 Judgment or the June 8, 2011, order denying Tutor's Motion to Set
 Aside Default Judgment, but only appealed from the August 12,
 2011, Order Denying Tutor's Motion for Reconsideration of the
 Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment.
 
A.
 
We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for 
reconsideration under the abuse of discretion standard. Ass'n 
of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai'i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). We conclude that the 
District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tutor's motion for reconsideration of the District Court's order denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. 
A motion for reconsideration "is not a device to 
relitigate old matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and should have been brought during the earlier proceeding." Id. (quoting Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai' i 505, 
513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000). Tutor's motion for reconsideration did not present arguments or evidence that could not have been raised in its previous Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. Therefore, the District Court properly denied Tutor's motion for reconsideration. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Wailea Elua, 100 Hawai' i at 110, 58 P.3d at 621. 
Tutor's motion for reconsideration was also untimely,
 
as the record reflects that it was filed more than ten days after
 the order denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
 was entered. See District Court Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 59
 
(1972). Although Tutor alleges that the order denying Tutor's
 Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment was "backdated," we
 conclude, based on the record before us, that Tutor's motion for
 reconsideration was untimely. 
B.
 
Because Tutor's motion for reconsideration was
 
untimely, it did not extend the time for Tutor to appeal from the 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
District Court's order denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside 
Default Judgment, see HRAP Rule 4(a) (2010), and we therefore lack jurisdiction to address Tutor's challenge to that order. Even assuming arguendo that we have jurisdiction, we would conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tutor's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. See County 
of Hawai' i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai' i 391, 423, 235 P.3d 
1103, 1135 (2010) (applying abuse of discretion standard to the denial of a motion to set aside default). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Tutor failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that it has a meritorious defense. See BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 77, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976); Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 
438-39, 16 P.3d 827, 843-44 (App. 2000). 
III.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District
 
Court's Order Denying Tutor's Motion for Reconsideration of the
 Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment.
