STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RICARDO APOLLONIO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAW
Â DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTC-10-010161)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ricardo Apollonio (Apollonio)
 
appeals the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment entered on August 23, 2011 in the District Court of
 
the First Circuit, Wahiawâ Division (district court).1
 
Apollonio was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) and
 
(c)(2) (2007 & Supp. 2011) arising from a citation issued by
 
Officer Robert Sepulveda (Officer Sepulveda) to Apollonio on
 
July 1, 2010 for excessive speeding of 76 miles per hour in a 35­
mile-per-hour zone.
 
On appeal, Apollonio contends that the district court
 
erred in admitting evidence of the laser gun reading without
 
evidence (1) of testing according to the manufacturer's
 
recommended procedures, and that the laser gun was operating

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
properly, (2) of the nature and extent of the officer's training
 
meeting the manufacturer's requirements, and (3) that the laser
 
had been inspected and serviced as required by the manufacturer.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Apollonio's points of error as follows.
 
Sufficient foundation for admission of the laser gun 
reading requires evidence: (1) "that the laser gun was tested 
according to manufacturer recommended procedures[,]" State v. 
Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233 (2009) 
(formatting altered); and (2) "whether the nature and extent of an officer's training in the operation of a laser gun meets the 
requirements indicated by the manufacturer[,]" Assaye, 121 
Hawai'i at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. The person proffering such 
foundational testimony should have personal knowledge of the 
manufacturer's recommendations for testing of the laser gun and 
of the laser gun testing according to said recommendations to 
overcome hearsay concerns. See Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213, 216 
P.3d at 1236 (analyzing the police officer's testimony consistent with State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai' i 343, 354, 167 P.3d 336, 347 
(2007), where the "expert's 'personal knowledge' that was adduced through his testimony at trial was sufficient 'to establish that 
the [gas chromatograph mass spectrometers (GCMS)] were in proper 
working condition'" (quoting Manewa, 115 Hawai' i at 354, 167 P.3d 
at 347)). 
With the foregoing principles in mind, evidence in the
 
instant case reflected the following. As to training on the
 laser gun and personal knowledge of the manufacturer's
 
recommended procedures in that regard, Officer Sepulveda, a
 
police officer for five-and-a-half years with the Honolulu Police
 
Department had been trained to use the LTI Ultralyte 20-20 laser
 
device for "eight hours" in "October, 2006", which included
 
"class work, going over the operator's manual, as well as hands-
on time with the laser itself, practical time" on the Ultralyte.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Officer Sepulveda confirmed that during training he was provided
 
with a training manual, which he acknowledged was provided by
 
Laser Technology, Incorporated, the manufacturer of the LTI 20­
20, which "says Operator's Manual, LTI 20-20 Operator's Manual"
 
although he later agreed that the manual may also say "Honolulu
 
Police Department" on it or have an HPD logo on it and could not
 
definitely say that the manual was not written or compiled by
 
HPD. Officer Sepulveda also confirmed that in his training, he
 
was taught tests recommended by the manufacturer to determine
 
whether the laser was working properly. Officer Sepulveda also
 
testified, as to review of the manual, that he had "glanced at it
 
many times since 2006."
 
Evidence from Officer Sepulveda's testimony described
 
four tests for the laser gun--the self test, display test, scope
 
alignment test, and the calibration or delta distance test--and
 
confirmed that he performed these four tests on the laser gun on
 
July 1, 2010, and that the results of the tests indicated that
 
the laser was operating correctly. Officer Sepulveda further
 
acknowledged that if the device was not functioning properly, he
 
"would have took [sic] it in and then notified the arsenal
 
sergeant and got a different machine, tested it, and made sure it
 
was working properly." Although Officer Sepulveda acknowledged
 
that he does not know whether the instrument was maintained on a
 
daily basis, as indicated above, he testified as to his training
 
on testing and use of the laser device in accordance with the
 
manufacturer's recommended procedures, and that his testing of
 
the device on the date of the incident, consistent with those
 
procedures, indicated that the laser device was functioning
 
properly.
 
In light of the foregoing, Officer Sepulveda's 
testimony was sufficient to establish that "the nature and extent 
of [Officer Sepulveda's] training in the operation of a laser gun 
meets the requirements indicated by the manufacturer." Assaye, 
121 Hawai' i at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. It also appears that 
Officer Sepulveda's testimony is consistent with the personal 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
knowledge of the Manewa chemist who testified that he tested the 
device and determined that "the parameters are within 
manufacturer's specifications[,]" and that "[he] would not have 
used any of the instruments if they were not in proper working 
condition in that particular days [sic]," Manewa, 115 Hawai' i at 
354, 167 P.3d at 347 (internal quotation marks omitted), upon which the Assaye court relied in stating that the "expert's 
'personal knowledge' that was adduced through his testimony at 
trial was sufficient 'to establish that the GCMSs were in proper 
working condition.'" 121 Hawai' i at 213, 216 P.3d at 1236 
(quoting Manewa, 115 Hawai' i at 354, 167 P.3d at 347). 
Although Apollonio cites to the Assaye concurring 
opinion in arguing that evidence must be presented to "show that the instrument has been inspected and serviced as required by the 
manufacturer[,]" as discussed above, where evidence of the 
manufacturer's recommended procedures exists by means of the 
officer's personal knowledge of the contents of the manual 
reflecting those recommended procedures, the Assaye court found 
no hearsay violation. See Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213-14, 216 
P.3d at 1236-37 (in part quoting Manewa, 115 Hawai' i at 354, 167 
P.3d at 347, and in part citing cases from other jurisdictions 
that involved testing of the laser in accordance with procedures 
recommended by the manufacturer). Moreover, within its 
calibration, the Assaye court discussed evidence of accepted 
procedures and cited with approval cases from other jurisdictions 
that involved testing of the laser in accordance with procedures 
recommended by the manufacturer. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 213-14, 
216 P.3d at 1236-37. This appears to reflect that the Assaye court required that, to overcome inadmissible hearsay as to 
calibration--similar to other foundational evidence regarding 
proper operation of the laser gun--evidence must be presented as 
to the manufacturer's accepted procedures for testing of the 
laser to ensure proper operation, and that the laser was tested 
in accordance with such procedures. However, the Assaye majority 
4

did not require any further showing of inspection and service as
 
required by the manufacturer.
 
Consequently, reviewing the determination of foundation 
for abuse of discretion, Assaye, 121 Hawai' i at 210, 216 P.3d at 
1233, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai' i 60, 69, 148 P.3d 493, 502 (2006) (quoting 
State v. Maldonado, 108 Hawai' i 436, 442, 121 P.3d 901, 907 
(2005)), Apollonio's first point that the district court erred in 
admitting the laser gun reading because of insufficient 
foundation as to training, testing, and operation of the laser 
consistent with the manufacturer's recommended procedures and was 
found to be working properly and second point alleging 
insufficient foundation of inspection and servicing as required 
by the manufacturer cannot be sustained. Based on the foregoing, 
therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on August 23,
 
2011 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiawâ
 
Division, is affirmed.
