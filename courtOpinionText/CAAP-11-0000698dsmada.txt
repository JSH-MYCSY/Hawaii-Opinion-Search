NO. CAAP-11-0000698
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
TROY CAPITAL, LLC., a Nevada limited liability company,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v. JAMES J. FRANCO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
PUNA DIVISION
 
(3RC11-1-132)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant James J. Franco's
 
(Appellant Franco) appeal from the Honorable Harry P. Freitas's
 
October 18, 2011 "Order Denying Defendant's Motion for
 
Reconsideration or New Trial" (the October 18, 2011 interlocutory
 
order), because, in the absence of a written final judgment or
 
written final order that adjudicates all claims, the October 18,
 
2011 interlocutory order is not appealable under Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011).
 HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate
 
court of appeals from a district court's final judgments, orders,
 
or decrees.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
. When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawaif i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted) (emphases added). The separate judgment document rule 
under Rule 58 of the Hawaif i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaif i 115, 869 
P.2d 1334 (1994) is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawaif i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). Nevertheless, when a party seeks appellate 
review, either a written final judgment or a written final order 
is necessary for the purpose of finality. Rule 4(a)(5) of the 
Hawaifi Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that "[a] judgment 
or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." Consequently, a district court's "oral decision 
is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawaif i 73, 
77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005). Although the district court minutes reflect the district court's oral announcement that it 
will enter a judgment in the future, "a minute order is not an 
appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 
88 Hawaif i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis 
added). "In civil cases before the district court, the filing of 
the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of 
the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such 
entry." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawaif i at 77, 110 P.3d at 401 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); cf State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawaif i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003) 
("Accordingly, we hold that, in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a 
written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."). In the instant case,
 
the district court has not entered a written judgment or written
 
order that ends the litigation by fully deciding the rights and
 
liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing further to be
 
adjudicated.
 
At first glance, it might appear that Appellant Franco 
is appealing from a post-judgment order, because the October 18, 
2011 interlocutory order denied Appellant Franco's August 8, 2011 
motion for reconsideration of the district court's oral decision 
(reflected in the district court minutes) to enter a judgment 
against Appellant Franco. Furthermore, "[a] post-judgment order 
is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order 
ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be 
accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawaif i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). Nevertheless, the instant case does not involve a post-judgment proceeding, because the 
district court has not yet actually entered a written "judgment," 
which Rule 54(a) of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure 
(DCRCP) specifically defines as "any order from which an appeal 
lies." DCRCP Rule 54(a) (emphasis added). Although Appellant 
Franco purported to invoke DCRCP Rule 59 in support of his 
August 8, 2011 motion for reconsideration, the district court 
had not yet entered any judgment, and, thus, DCRCP Rule 59 was 
inapplicable. DCRCP Rule 54(b) is the applicable rule 
authorizing that any "order or other form of decision is subject 
to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating 
all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the 
parties." DCRCP Rule 54(b). 
Under analogous circumstances, when the Supreme Court 
of Hawaif i has analyzed whether a party can invoke HRCP 
Rule 60(b) for post-judgment relief prior to the entry of a judgment, the Supreme Court of Hawaif i has explained that "a 
motion for reconsideration, pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), is authorized only in situations involving final judgments." Cho v. 
State, 115 Hawaif i at 382, 168 P.3d at 26 (citations and internal 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
quotation marks omitted); Crown Properties, Inc. v. Financial
 
Security Life Insurance Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. at 112, 712 P.2d
 
at 509 ("A Rule 60(b), HRCP, motion is authorized only in
 
situations involving final judgments."); Tradewinds Hotel, Inc.
 
v. Cochrane, 8 Haw. App. at 262, 799 P.2d at 65 ("Rule 60(b) 
applies to motions seeking to amend final orders in the nature of 
judgments."). Therefore, without a judgment, "relief pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 60(b) was not available[.]" Cho v. State, 115 Hawaif i 
at 383, 382, 168 P.3d at 27. 
Similarly in the instant case, the district court has 
not yet entered a written "judgment," as DCRCP Rule 54(b) defines that term. In the absence of a written judgment, the October 18, 
2011 interlocutory order is not a post-judgment order, but, 
instead, it is actually a pre-judgment order that will be 
eligible for appellate review only by way of an appeal from a 
written final judgment that adjudicates all of the claims. Cf. 
Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawaif i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) 
("An appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all 
interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which 
deal with issues in the case." (Citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted)). Absent a written judgment, the intermediate 
court of appeals lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the 
October 18, 2011 interlocutory order. 
Under Hawaif i case law, when an appellate court 
determines that it lacks jurisdiction, the only appropriate 
remedy is dismissal. 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

 We note, however, that upon dismissal of this appeal, Appellant
