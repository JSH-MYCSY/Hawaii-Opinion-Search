NO. CAAP-11-0000700
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RICHARD HOMER GIBSON, JR., Defedant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-105)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Appellant Richard Homer Gibson, Jr.'s
 
(Appellant Gibson), appeal from the Honorable Greg K. Nakamura's
 
August 31, 2011 judgment of conviction against Appellant Gibson
 
for assault in the third degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 707-712 (1993) because the August 31, 2011
 
judgment is not appealable under HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2011).
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v.
 Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or 
agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) 
(Supp. 2011). "Any party deeming oneself aggrieved by the 
judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to 
the intermediate appellate court[.]" HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2011). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the
 
judgment." Id. It appears that the sentencing in this case is
 
incomplete, however, because, although the August 31, 2011
 judgment sentences Appellant Gibson to imprisonment, the
 
August 31, 2011 judgment additionally provides that the circuit
 
court is sentencing Appellant Gibson to restitution in an amount
 
to be determined at some time in the future. The record does not
 
contain any order with a determination of the amount of
 
restitution that Appellant Gibson must pay as a part of his
 
sentence.
 
Under analogous circumstances in an appeal from a
 
district court judgment in a criminal case, we have held that a
 
judgment is not final and appealable unless the sentence is
 
final:
 
Judgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence. In the
 instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay restitution. The court did
 not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount. Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
appeal from the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005). Similarly in the instant case, the August 31, 2011 
judgment is not final, because the August 31, 2011 judgment 
indicates that the circuit court intends to sentence Appellant 
Gibson to restitution in an amount to be determined at some time 
in the future. Consequently, the sentence in the August 31, 2011 
judgment is not final, and, thus, the August 31, 2011 judgment is 
not an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-11. Absent an 
appealable final judgment in the record on appeal, we cannot

exercise appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number
 
CAAP-11-0000700. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Gibson's appeal in
 
appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000700 is dismissed for lack
 
of jurisdiction.
