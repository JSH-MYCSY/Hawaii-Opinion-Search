v.
 
SARAH V.P. SPEARMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(HPD TRAFFIC NO. 1DTA-11-02146)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sarah V.P. Spearman (Spearman)
 
appeals from the "Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment" 
(Judgment) filed on August 29, 2011, in the District Court of the
 First Circuit (District Court).
1 Spearman was charged by
 
complaint with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2011).
2 Prior to trial, the

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provide as follows:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the intoxicant.
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a 	person operates

District Court denied Spearman's oral motion to dismiss the
 
charge as deficient for failing to allege any mens rea. 
A bench trial was held before the District Court. The
 
District Court granted Spearman's motion for judgment of
 acquittal as to the violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), and it
 found Spearman guilty of OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E­61(a)(1). 
On appeal, Spearman contends that the OVUII charge was
 
deficient because it failed to alleged that she committed the
 offense intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. She therefore
 argues that the District Court erred in denying her motion to
 dismiss the complaint and in convicting her of OVUII in violation
 of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
 
In State v. Nesmith, Nos. SCWC-10-0000072, SCWC-30438, 
2012 WL 1648974 (Hawai' i April 12, 2012), the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court recently held that (1) mens rea must be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not be alleged (or proven) in a charge
 asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), because the
 legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. Pursuant to
 Nesmith, we conclude that Spearman's HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge
 was deficient for failing to allege mens rea.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 29, 2011, Judgment
 
of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded with
 
instructions to dismiss without prejudice the portion of the
 complaint alleging a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).

 We note that because the District Court acquitted Spearman with
respect to the alleged HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) violation, the protection against
double jeopardy would preclude Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i from 
reprosecuting Spearman for violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).
