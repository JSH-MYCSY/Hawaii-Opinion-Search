IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
EMERSON M.F. JOU, M.D., Plaintiff-Appellant, v.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2758)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D.'s 
(Appellant Dr. Jou), appeal in appellate court case number CAAP­
11-0000706 from the Honorable Rom A. Trader's September 8, 2011 
judgment, because the September 8, 2011 judgment does not satisfy 
the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 
of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or 
decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner 
. . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP 
Rule 58. The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal 
may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and 
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $     is hereby entered
in favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts
I through IV of the complaint." 
A statement that declares
 
"there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "
all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 
Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims 
against all parties or contain the finding necessary for 
certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although Appellant Dr. Jou asserted multiple causes of
 
action against Defendant-Appellee K. Kenneth Siu (Appellee Siu)
 
through a November 25, 2009 complaint, a June 15, 2010 first
 
amended complaint, and a September 27, 2011 second amended
 
complaint, the September 8, 2011 judgment enters judgment in
 
favor of Appellee Siu and against Appellant Dr. Jou only as to
 
Appellant Dr. Jou's November 25, 2009 complaint. The
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
September 8, 2011 judgment expressly provides that it does not
 
affect any subsequently filed complaint. Although the
 
September 8, 2011 judgment does not resolve all claims in this
 
case, the September 8, 2011 judgment does not contain an express
 
finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on
 
one or more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Therefore, the September 28, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the
 
requirements for an appealable judgment in a multiple party case
 
under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent the entry
 
of an appealable final judgment, the appeal is premature, and we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over the appellate court case number
 
CAAP-11-0000706. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in appellate court
 
case number CAAP-11-0000706 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
