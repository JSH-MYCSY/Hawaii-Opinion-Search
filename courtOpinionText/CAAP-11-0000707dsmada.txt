ORDER GRANTING FEBRUARY 10, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/
 
Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Lihue Townhouse
 
(Appellee AOAO Lihue Townhouse) and Defendants-Appellees Conrad
 
Murashige (Appellee Murashige), Shannon Brunner (Appellee

(Appellee Maher), Mark Myers (Appellee Myers), and RE3, LLC, Real
 
Estate Services' (Appellee RE3 LLC Real Estate Services)
 
February 10, 2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 
CAAP-11-0000707 for lack of jurisdiction, 
(2) the lack of any memorandum in opposition to Appellees AOAO 
Lihue Townhouse, Murashige, Brunner, Nishikawa, Maher, Myers, 
and RE3 LLC Real Estate Services' February 10, 2012 motion to 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000707 for lack of 
jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant 
Suzanne Kitamura's (Appellant Kitamura) appeal from the Honorable 
Kathleen N.A. Watanabe August 29, 2011 "Order Granting Motion to 
Withdraw as Counsel for Plaintiffs McGrath Properties I, LLC, and 
Suzanne Kitamura" (the August 29, 2011 interlocutory order) 
because the circuit court has not yet entered a final judgment on 
all claims pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), and the August 29, 2011 interlocutory order is not independently appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 641-1(a)(1993 & Supp. 2011). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
holds "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in 
favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the 
party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will 
be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment on all claims in this case. Absent a separate judgment, the August 11, 
2011 interlocutory order is not eligible for appellate review.

 Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine 
(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS 
§ 641-1(b), the August 11, 2011 interlocutory order does not 
satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) 
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the 
Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an 
appeal from an interlocutory order). We note, in particular, 
that under analogous circumstances, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
has held that an order granting a motion to disqualify counsel is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Chuck v. St. 
Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 61 Haw. 552, 556-57, 606 P.2d at 1323-24 (1980). Instead, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i "has 
determined that a petition for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is an appropriate vehicle for reviewing an order of 
disqualification." Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawai' i 
410, 414, 917 P.2d 1284, 1288 (1996) (citation omitted). Similarly in the instant case, an order granting counsel's motion 
to withdraw from representing a party is not immediately 
appealable by the party under the collateral order doctrine. 
Therefore, the August 11, 2011 interlocutory order is not an 
appealable order. Absent an appealable separate judgment, 
Appellant Kitamura's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000707. 
Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees AOAO Lihue
 
Townhouse, Murashige, Brunner, Nishikawa, Maher, Myers, and RE3
 LLC Real Estate Services' February 10, 2012 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000707 for lack of
 
3
 jurisdiction is granted, and this appeal is dismissed for lack of
 
appellate jurisdiction.
