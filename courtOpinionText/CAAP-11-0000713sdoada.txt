SUSAN BLAU, Claimant-Appellee, v.
AIG HAWAII INSURANCE COMPANY, JOHN DOES 1-10,
Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 09-1-0041)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J. and Fujise, J.,
with Ginoza, J., concurring separately)
 
Respondent-Appellant Farmers Insurance Hawaii, Inc.,
 
formerly known as AIG Hawaii Insurance Company, Inc. (AIG),
 
appeals from a Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)
 
September 1, 2011 order granting Claimant-Appellee Susan Blau's
 
(Blau) motion to confirm arbitration award and for attorneys'
 
fees, costs, and post-judgment interest.1 The arbitrator2

awarded Blau prejudgment  interest and costs in excess of the
$
20,000.00 insurance policy limit. The Circuit Court confirmed
 
1 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided. 
2 Andrew P. Wilson, Esq. was the arbitrator. 
3 We note that the arbitrator awarded "pre-award" interest, not
"prejudgment" interest, because "[t]he arbitrator's award is not a judgment of
a court of law." Kenneth H. Hughes, Inc. v. Aloha Tower Dev., Corp., 654 F.
Supp. 2d 1142, 1147 (D. Hawai' i 2009). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

the arbitration award in the amount of $24,620.17,  and granted
$1,800.00 in attorneys' fees to Blau for enforcing the award.
 
On appeal, AIG maintains that the Circuit Court erred
 
in confirming an award of prejudgment interest and costs that was
 
in excess of the $20,000.00 policy limit and abused its
 
discretion in awarding $1,800.00 in attorneys' fees associated
 
with Blau's motion for confirmation of arbitration award.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 
authority, we resolve AIG's points on appeal as follows and
 
affirm.
 
Although Blau does not raise this argument in her
 
Answering Brief, we conclude that the Circuit Court's
 
confirmation of the arbitration award should be affirmed on the
 
5
grounds  that AIG waived its right to challenge the arbitration
award by filing a memo in opposition to Blau's motion
 
to confirm rather than moving to modify or correct the
 
arbitration award pursuant to HRS § 658A-24 (Supp. 2013),6 or
 
4 The amount of $24,620.17 is the sum of the $20,000.00 policy
 
limit, $4,101.00 in prejudgment interest, and $519.17 in costs.

("It is well settled, however, that the appellate court may affirm a lower
court's decision on any ground in the record supporting affirmance, even ifnot cited by the lower court.")

Modification or correction of award.  (a) Upon motion
made within ninety days after the movant receives notice of
the award pursuant to section 658A-19 or within ninety days
after the movant receives notice of a modified or corrected
 award pursuant to section 658A-20, the court shall modify
or correct the award if:
 
(1)	 There was an evident mathematical miscalculation
 or an evident mistake in the description of a
person, thing, or property referred to in the
award;
 
(2)	 The arbitrator has made an award on a claim not
 submitted to the arbitrator and the award may be
corrected without affecting the merits of the
decision upon the claims submitted; or

7	 HRS § 658A-23 provides, in pertinent part:
 
Vacating award.  (a) Upon motion to the court by a
party to an arbitration proceeding, the court shall vacate
an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:

(A)	 Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator;
 
(B)	 Corruption by an arbitrator; or

the rights of a party to the arbitration
proceeding;
 
(3)	 An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing
upon showing of sufficient cause for
postponement, refused to consider evidence
material to the controversy, or otherwise
conducted the hearing contrary to the section
658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
 
(4)	 An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;
 
(5)	 There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the
person participated in the arbitration
proceeding without raising the objection under
section 658A-15(c) not later than the beginning
of the arbitration hearing; or
 
(6)	 The arbitration was conducted without proper
notice of the initiation of an arbitration as
 required in section 658A-9 so as to prejudice
substantially the rights of a party to the
arbitration proceeding.
 
(b) A motion under this section shall be filed
 
within ninety days after the movant receives notice of the
award pursuant to section 658A-19 or within ninety days

 HRS § 658A-22 provides:
 
[§658A-22] Confirmation of award.  After a party to an
arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the party may
make a motion to the court for an order confirming the award at
which time the court shall issue a confirming order unless the

658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section 658A-23.
 
(continued...)

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
language of HRS § 658A-22 unambiguously states that where a party
 
moves to confirm an arbitration award, the court must confirm the
 
award "unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to
 
section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section
 
658A-23." (Emphasis added.) 
Here, it is undisputed that AIG did not file a motion9 
to modify, correct, or vacate the arbitration award. Thus, 
pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 658A-22, the Circuit 
Court was statutorily mandated to confirm the award. See 
Malahoff v. Saito, 111 Hawai 'i 168, 191, 140 P.3d 401, 424 (2006) 
("It is well-established that, where a statute contains the word 
'shall,' the provision generally will be construed as 
mandatory."). 
In light of the foregoing, given that AIG seeks to
 
challenge the arbitration award but failed to file a motion to
 
vacate, modify, or correct pursuant to HRS § 658A-23 or § 658A­
24, it is foreclosed from appealing the confirmation order.
 
On appeal, AIG appears to recast its argument as a
 
challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, by arguing that
 
the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he awarded Blau
 
prejudgment interest and costs in excess of the $20,000.00 policy
 
limit. To the contrary, the record does not indicate that the
 
arbitrator manifestly exceeded his authority under the agreement
 
of the parties.
 
In Tropicana Manor, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that 
an arbitrator exceeded his authority by reopening an arbitration 
hearing after issuing an award, 73 Haw. at 203, 830 P.2d at 505, 
and that appellants could not have waived their right to object

(Emphases added.)

 Nor does AIG's memorandum in opposition to Blau's motion to
confirm state grounds that would have formed the basis for a motion to modify,
correct or vacate. AIG opposed the motion to confirm on the basis that the
arbitration award was contrary to (1) the "majority view" regarding pre-award
interest in excess of policy limits, (2) the arbitration agreement, and (3)
public policy insofar as it interfered with the parties' freedom to contract
for certain policy limits.

provided:
ARBITRATION
If we and an insured do not agree:

6to the arbitrator's authority to reopen the hearing and issue an
amended award even though they participated in the reopened
proceedings "because a jurisdictional issue as to the
arbitrator's authority to reopen the hearing is involved[.]"  Id.
at 211, 830 P.2d at 509. 
"Judicial review is limited to cases in which the
arbitrators manifestly exceed the agreement between the parties." 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai# i 226, 234, 54 P.3d 397, 405
(2002).  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has "reserved the phrase
'exceeded their powers' as reference to arbitrators' improper
consideration of matters outside the scope of the arbitration
agreement[.]"  Id. at 235, 54 P.3d at 406.  "Under Hawai# i law,
any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be
resolved in favor of arbitration."  Cnty. of Hawai #i v. UNIDEV,
LLC., 129 Hawai #i 378, 394, 301 P.3d 588, 604 (2013) (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted).  We determine "[w]hat
issues, if any, are beyond the scope of a contractual agreement
to arbitrate [] on the wording of the contractual agreement to
arbitrate."  UNIDEV , 129 Hawai #i at 394, 301 P.3d at 604
(emphasis in original; citation and internal quotation marks
omitted).  "[W]here the entire dispute is submitted to
arbitration and pre-award interest is not specifically excluded
by contract, arbitrators have the authority to make an award of
interest as part of the determination of the total amount of
compensation to which the prevailing party is entitled." 
Kalawaia v. AIG Hawai #i Ins. Co. , 90 Hawai #i 167, 173 n.11, 977
P.2d 175, 181 n.11 (1999).  
Assuming, arguendo, that AIG's arguments amount to a
challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, we conclude that
the arbitration provision here10 expressly permitted either partyNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to demand arbitration if there is a dispute concerning the amount 
of damages, and there was no specific prohibition against nor 
exclusion of the arbitrator's exercise of authority with respect 
to the issue of prejudgment interest and costs. In addition, 
where the parties agree to arbitrate, they "thereby assume all 
the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that 
the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law and 
in their findings of fact." Tatibouet, 99 Hawai 'i at 236, 54 
P.3d at 407 (citation omitted); Low v. Minichino, 126 Hawai 'i 99, 
105, 267 P.3d 683, 689 (App. 2011) (applying same principles of 
judicial review for HRS Chapter 658 to Chapter 658A). 
AIG also argues that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in awarding Blau $1,800.00 in attorneys' fees expended
 
to enforce the arbitrator's award. We disagree. 
The Circuit Court awarded attorneys' fees pursuant to 
HRS § 658A-25 (Supp. 2013).11 "Under the plain language of HRS § 
658A-25(c), [] reasonable attorney's fees may only be awarded to a party who prevails in a contested judicial proceeding to 
confirm, vacate, modify, or correct an arbitration award." In re 
Arbitration Between United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL­CIO & City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai
'i 201, 209, 194 P.3d

 HRS § 658A-25 provides in relevant part:
 
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a
contested judicial proceeding under section 658A-22, 658A­23, or 658A-24, the court may add reasonable attorney's fees
and other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in a
judicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgment
confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,
modifying, or correcting an award.

Here, AIG contested Blau's motion to confirm. 
Pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 658A-25(c), we cannot
 
conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion by awarding
 
$1,800.00 in attorneys' fees to Blau.
 
Based on the foregoing, the September 1, 2011 order 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
