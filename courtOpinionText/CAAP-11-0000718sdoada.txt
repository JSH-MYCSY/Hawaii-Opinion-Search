STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERT M. ANDERSON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAWÂ DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-06649)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Robert M. Anderson (Anderson)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 Plea/Judgment (Judgment and Order) entered on September 8, 2011
 
in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiawâ Division
 
(district court).
1 Anderson was charged by complaint with
 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII),
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1)

 The Honorable Lono Lee presided.

and/or (a)(3) and (b)(3) (Supp. 2011).2 The district court found
 
Anderson guilty of violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
 
On appeal, Anderson contends that the district court
 
erred in denying his motion to dismiss in which he argued that
 
the complaint was deficient for failing to allege that he
 
committed the OVUII offense intentionally, knowingly, or
 
recklessly and his right against self-incrimination was violated
 
when the district court imposed a penalty for pleading not guilty
 
to the offense.
 
In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617 
(2012), the Hawai' i Supreme Court recently held that: (1) mens 
rea must be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and 
cause of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not be alleged (or 
proven) in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), 
because the legislative intent to impose absolute liability for 
an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. Nesmith; see 
also State v. Yamahata, No. SCWC-30718 2012 WL 1571382 (Haw. May 3, 2012)(SDO); State v. Flynn, No. SCWC-10-0000245 2012 WL 
1560666 (Haw. May 1, 2012)(SDO); State v. Daniels, No. SCWC-10­
0000243 2012 WL 1560656 (Haw. Apr. 30, 2012)(SDO); State v. 
Shinsato, No. SCWC-30720 2012 WL 1560663 (Haw. Apr. 30, 
2012)(SDO); State v. Padilla, No. SCWC-30719 2012 WL 1560660 
(Haw. Apr. 30, 2012)(SDO). 
2	 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provides as follows:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
. . . .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that
 
mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge and
 
Anderson's HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing
 
to allege mens rea.
 
Our resolution of Anderson's first point of error makes
 
it unnecessary to address his second point of error.3
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the District Court of the
 
First Circuit, Wahiawâ Division's Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on September 8, 2011 is
 
vacated and the matter is remanded for dismissal of the charge
 
without prejudice.

Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 26, 2012.

 Because the parties do not address the alleged violation of HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(3) and the record with respect to this violation is incomplete,
we also do not address whether reprosecution of Anderson for violating HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(3) would be permissible.
