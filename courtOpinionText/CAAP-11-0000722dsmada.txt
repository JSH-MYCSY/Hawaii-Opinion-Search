Appellant Waltrip's appeal from the Labor and Industrial

Relations Appeals Board's  following three orders:
(1)	 July 25, 2011 decision and order;
 
(2)	 August 29, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's
request to reconsider the July 25, 2011 decision and
order; and
 
(3)	 September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's
motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order.
 
The Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
 
July 25, 2011 decision and order was a final decision and order
 
in a contested case" under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91­14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) that was appealable directly to the
 intermediate court of appeals pursuant to HRS § 386-88 (Supp.
 2011). Pursuant to Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47­53(a) (2011), Appellant Waltrip extended the thirty-day time
 period under HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2011) for filing a notice of
 appeal when Appellant Waltrip filed her August 23, 2011 request
 for reconsideration within thirty days after entry of the LIRAB's
 July 25, 2011 decision and order, as HAR § 12-47-53(a) requires. 
However, Appellant Waltrip did not file her October 3, 2011
 notice of appeal within thirty days after the Labor and
 Industrial Relations Appeals Board's August 29, 2011 mailing of
 the August 29, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's August 23,
 2011 request for reconsideration of the July 25, 2011 decision
 and order, in violation of the thirty-day time period for doing
 so under HAR § 12-47-53(a). Consequently, Appellant Waltrip's
 October 3, 2011 notice of appeal is untimely as to the Labor and

Industrial Relations Appeals Board's July 25, 2011 decision and 
order and August 29, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's request to reconsider the July 25, 2011 decision and order. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 
1128 (1986). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Appellant Waltrip's appeal as to the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's July 25, 2011 decision and order and August 29, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's request to reconsider the July 25, 2011 decision and order. 
Nevertheless, it appears that we might have appellate 
jurisdiction over Appellant Waltrip's appeal from the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order. Under analogous circumstances, Hawai' i 
appellate courts have acknowledged the appealability of a post-judgment order that ended a post-judgment proceeding and left nothing further to be accomplished in the post-judgment proceeding. Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 
978 (2003) (regarding HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 1993 & Supp. 2011)); Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai' i 105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 
2001) (regarding HRS § 571-54 (2006)), affirmed in part, and vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai' i 318, 
22 P.3d 965 (2001); State v. Johnson, 96 Hawai' i 462, 469, 32 
P.3d 106, 113 (App. 2001) (regarding HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2011)).

The Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's September 28, 
2011 order appears to have ended the post-judgment proceedings for Appellant Waltrip's September 23, 2011 motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order, and it left nothing further to be accomplished. Therefore, it appears that the September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order might be an appealable post-judgment order pursuant to HRS § 386-88. Appellant Waltrip filed her October 3, 2011 notice of appeal within thirty days after the September 28, 2011 mailing of the September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order, as HRS § 386-88 appears to require. Therefore, it appears that Appellant Waltrip's appeal might be timely as to the September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order. Consequently, we might have appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Waltrip's appeal as to the September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order. At this preliminary time in the appeal, we need not conclusively decide the issue whether we have appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Waltrip's appeal as to the September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Special Compensation
 
Fund's May 3, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000722
 for lack of jurisdiction is granted in part and denied in part. 
We grant Appellee Special Compensation Fund's May 3, 2012 motion
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000722 for lack of jurisdiction as 
to the following two orders: (1) the July 25, 2011 decision and order and (2) the August 29, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's request to reconsider the July 25, 2011 decision and order. We deny Appellee Special Compensation Fund's May 3, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000722 for lack of jurisdiction as to the September 28, 2011 order denying Appellant Waltrip's motion to vacate the July 25, 2011 decision and order, but we do so without prejudice to the parties' further addressing the issue of appellate jurisdiction in their respective appellate briefs. The parties shall proceed with briefing pursuant to Rule 28 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure.
