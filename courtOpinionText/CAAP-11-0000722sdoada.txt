DEBORAH J. WALTRIP, Claimant-Appellant v.
TS ENTERPRISES, INC., dba KIMO'S RESTAURANT,
Employer-Appellee, and FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE
COMPANY, Insurance Carrier-Appellee, and
SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL
 
RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD

 
(CASE NO. AB 2007-047(M); (7-02-00262))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
In this workers' compensation appeal, Claimant-
Appellant Deborah J. Waltrip ("Waltrip") appeals pro se from the
 
September 28, 2011 order ("Second Post-Judgment Order") of the
 Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board ("the Board")
 denying her September 23, 2011 post-judgment motion to vacate the
 Board's July 25, 2011 Decision and Order ("Decision"). Waltrip
 also appeals directly from the Decision and from the Board's
 August 29, 2011 order ("First Post-Judgment Order") denying her
 August 23, 2011 motion to reconsider the Decision. 
On May 31, 2012, this court granted in part the motion
 
to dismiss appeal for lack of jurisdiction filed by Appellee
 Special Compensation Fund, stating that this court lacked
 jurisdiction over Waltrip's appeal from the Decision and the
 First Post-Judgment Order. Accordingly, only the Second Post-
Judgment Order is considered in this appeal. 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Waltrip does not suggest a statutory or regulatory 
basis supporting her September 23, 2011 motion to vacate, which 
essentially was a second motion for reconsideration on the same grounds as the first, and we can find none. We hold that there was no authority for the Board to rule on the merits of the motion and, as such, rather than issuing a denial, the Board should have dismissed the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See Hawaii Mgmt. Alliance Ass'n v. Ins. Comm'r, 
106 Hawai
'i 21, 27, 100 P.3d 952, 958 (2004) (holding that the 
insurance commissioner's authority to hear external review appeals, as authorized by statute, was a question of subject matter jurisdiction); see also Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai
'i 474, 
480, 918 P.2d 1130, 1136 (1996) (stating that dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not an adjudication on the merits).
1 Accordingly, we vacate the Second Post-Judgment Order 
because the Board lacked subject matter jurisdiction. H AW. REV. 
STAT. ยง 386-87(d) (1993).  
Therefore,
 The September 28, 2011 Order Denying Claimant's Motion
 
to Vacate Decision of July 25, 2011 is vacated and the case is
 remanded to the Board for entry of an order dismissing the motion
 for lack of jurisdiction.

 Special Compensation Fund argues that "[t]o the extent that [the
Board] lacked jurisdiction, it would appear that [this court] would also lack
jurisdiction to entertain [Waltrip's] motion to vacate [the Board's] decisionand order." However, this court has jurisdiction to correct an error in
jurisdiction. See, e.g., Koga Eng'g & Const., Inc. v. State, 122 Hawai' i 60,
84, 222 P.3d 979, 1003 (2010).
