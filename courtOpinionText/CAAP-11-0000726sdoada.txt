Appellee Investors Funding Corp. (IFC) and against the Shumards 
and all other parties to this foreclosure action, pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b). 
On appeal, the Shumards raise two points of error,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary
 
judgment in favor of IFC because: (1) IFC "failed to allege and
 
prove the giving of the cancellation notice and recordation of an
 
affidavit to that effect," and (2) "predatory lending is a
 
defense to foreclosure and discovery was needed because the facts
 
were in the knowledge of [IFC]."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the Shumards' points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Shumards' first contention is without merit. 
First, this issue was not raised in the court below. Generally, 
issues not raised at the trial level will not be considered on 
appeal. See, e.g., Cox v. Cox, 125 Hawai' i 19, 26, 250 P.3d 775, 
782 (2011). Therefore, this argument is waived. In addition, the case relied on by the Shumards is inapplicable as it does not 
appear from the record that either the subject note or mortgage 
required any sort of cancellation notice or recordation of 
affidavit. 
(2) The Shumards' second contention is without merit. 
No such defenses were raised in the court below. Nor does it
 
appear from the record that the Shumards attempted to conduct
 
discovery. This argument is waived.
