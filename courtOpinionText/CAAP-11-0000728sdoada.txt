SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In an appeal arising out of a foreclosure lawsuit,
 
Defendants-Appellants Gary Mitsuhiro Yamamoto and Darrah
 
Kalahualani Rowe Yamamoto (Yamamotos) appeal from:
 
(1) the October 25, 2010 "Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against all Defendants on Complaint Filed March 18, 2009";
 
(2) the August 29, 2011 "Order Denying Defendants Gary
 
Mitsuhiro Yamamoto and Darrah Kalahualani Rowe Yamamoto's Motion
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to Set Aside on Jurisdictional Grounds this Courts October 25,
 
2010 (1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed March 18, 2009, and (2)
 
Judgment Thereon, Filed June 16, 2011"; and 
(3) the September 6, 2011 "Order Denying Defendants
 
Gary Mitsuhiro Yamamoto and Darrah Kalahualani Rowe Yamamoto's
 
Motion for Rehearing And/Or Reconsideration, Etc., Filed on
 
August 1, 2011" all entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court).
The judgment and orders were entered in favor of
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.S. (Wells Fargo) and 
(1)
 denied the Yamamotos' June 16, 2011 motion to set
 
aside the judgment (Motion to Set Aside);
 
(2) denied the Yamamotos' August 1, 2011 motion for
 
rehearing and/or reconsideration; and 
(3) confirmed the sale of the foreclosed property.
 
The Yamamotos contend the circuit court lacked personal
 
jurisdiction over them because they were never personally served
 with the summons and complaint until after the circuit court had
 
entered the summary judgment and decree of foreclosure against
 
them. The Yamamotos also contend that Wells Fargo was not the
 
owner of the underlying promissory note or the mortgage and
 
therefore lacked standing to foreclose.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
At the hearing on the Yamamotos' Motion to Set Aside,
 
the process server testified that he remembered serving Darrah
 
Yamamoto. His testimony is corroborated by two Return and

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Acknowledgment of Service documents with Darrah Yamamoto's
 
signature, accepting service on her and her husband's behalf. 
The return of service documents serve as prima facie evidence of
 
the events that occurred at the time of service. Tropic
 
Builders, Ltd v. Naval Ammunition Depot Lualualei Quarters, Inc.,
 48 Haw. 306, 313, 402 P.2d 440, 445 (1965). 
The Yamamotos also attack Wells Fargo's standing to
 
foreclose, arguing that Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems,
 
Inc.'s (MERS) role as SecurityNational Mortgage Company, Inc.'s
 
(SecurityNational) nominee did not give it the authority to
 
execute the Assignment of Mortgage to Wells Fargo.
 
The Yamamotos' assertion is inconsistent with the plain
 
language of the mortgage, which expressly establishes that MERS
 
is the mortgagee under the security instrument and permits MERS
 
to take action on the lender's behalf. The mortgage identifies
 
MERS as "a separate corporation that is acting solely as nominee
 
for Lender . . . . MERS is the mortgagee under this Security
 
Instrument." The mortgage also gives MERS "the right to
 
foreclose and sell the Property[,] and to take any action
 
required of Lender . . . ." Under this plain language, MERS had
 
the authority to take any action required of SecurityNational,
 
including assigning the mortgage to Wells Fargo.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that 
(1) the October 25, 2010 "Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against all Defendants on Complaint Filed March 18, 2009";
