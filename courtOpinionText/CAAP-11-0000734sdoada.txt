IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DJOMAR ROMUALDO ARIOS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTA-11-00601)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Djomar Romualdo Arios (Arios) 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, 
entered on September 27, 2011 in the District Court of the First 
Circuit, ' Ewa Division (District Court) in 1DTA-11-00601.1 
On February 14, 2011, Arios was charged by written 
complaint with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2012). 
On September 20, 2011, the court called two matters, 
Case Nos. 1DTA-11-00601 and 1DTI-11-0001838. 
Arios was orally 
charged with OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). The State elected not to proceed with trial upon a charge of 
violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). Arios was also orally charged 
with driving a motor vehicle 49 miles per hour in a

35 miles per hour zone, in violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1). 
Immediately after being charged, Arios moved to dismiss the OVUII
 
charge for failing to state an essential fact, mens rea. The
 
motion was denied, and after a trial, Arios was convicted of
 
OVUII.2
 
On appeal, Arios contends that the OVUII charge was 
deficient for failing to allege the requisite mens rea. The 
State concedes that the OVUII charge failed to state the 
requisite mens rea as required by State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 
48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Arios's points of error as follows:
 
In Nesmith, the Supreme Court held that mens rea must 
be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause 
of the accusation. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 52-56, 276 P.3d at 
621-25. Where the charge does not contain the requisite mens 
rea, Nesmith mandates dismissal without prejudice. State v. 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012). As 
such, we need not address Arios's argument regarding the laser 
2 In his Opening Brief, Arios also argues that evidence of a laser
gun reading should have been suppressed. However, it appears Arios failed to
appeal from his speeding infraction. Transcripts in the record on appeal
indicate that Case No. 1DTI-11-0001838 was called and heard concurrently with
1DTA-11-00601. Contrary to Arios's claim, the record does not indicate that
the cases were consolidated. The records for Case No. 1DTI-11-0001838 were
 not made part of the record on appeal. Arios's Notice of Appeal and
Jurisdiction Statement fail to reference Case No. 1DTI-11-0001838 and there is
 no copy of the judgment on the speeding infraction attached to his Notice of
Appeal or included in the record on appeal. Thus, there is no indication that
Arios intended to appeal Case No. 1DTI-11-0001838, until his Opening Brief.
As Arios failed to timely appeal the judgment in Case No. 1DTI-11-00001838,
this court lacks jurisdiction to address any points of error relating to Case
No. 1DTI-11-0001838.

speed reading to the extent it pertains to the OVUII charge. See
 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d at 798. 
THEREFORE, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order, entered on September 27, 2011 in the District Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division in 1DTA-11­
00601 is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the charge without prejudice.
