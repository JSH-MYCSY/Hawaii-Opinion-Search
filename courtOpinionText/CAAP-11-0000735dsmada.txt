 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
over this appeal that Respondent-Appellant Edward Kakalia
 
(Appellant Kakalia) has asserted from the Land Court’s October
 26, 2011 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Substituted
 Applicant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Apana 2 of Land
 Commission Award 8520 (Lot 1), Filed on 8/3/11" (the October 26,
 2011 summary judgment order), because the land court has not yet
 reduced the October 26, 2011 summary judgment to a separate
 judgment.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees of the land court to the intermediate court of appeals. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) apply to "[p]roceedings in the land court under chapter 501[.]" HRCP Rule 81(b)(1). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. The separate 
judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an order that is not reduced 
to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 
120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and 
Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) 
(citation omitted; emphasis added). 
The October 26, 2011 summary judgment order is not a
 
judgment. On December 8, 2011, the record on appeal for
 appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000735 was filed, at which
 time the record on appeal did not contain a separate judgment
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that either resolved all claims or contained an express finding
 
of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or
 more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), as
 HRCP Rule 58 requires for an appeal under the holding in Jenkins. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack jurisdiction over
 appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000735. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Kahoma Land's
 
November 2, 2011 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000735 is
 granted, and Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000735 is dismissed for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction.
