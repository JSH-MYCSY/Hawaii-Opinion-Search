JERRY MAGALION, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(1SD11-1-00006)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Jerry Magalion (Magalion) appeals 
from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying 
Amended [Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment" (Order Denying Amended Petition) filed by the District Court of the 
1
First Circuit (Circuit Court)  on October 4, 2011.  We affirm.
 
I.
 
In his underlying criminal case, Magalion pleaded
 
guilty to operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) (Supp. 2006).

represented by counsel. On May 2, 2007, the District Court
 
sentenced Magalion and filed its Judgment. Magalion did not
 appeal his conviction or sentence. 
On September 6, 2011, Magalion filed a petition for
 
post-conviction relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 (2006), and he
 filed an amendment to the petition on September 28, 2011.
 Magalion's petition, as amended, is referred to as the "Amended
 Petition." The District Court denied Magalion's Amended Petition
 through its Order Denying Amended Petition filed on October 4,
 2011.
 
On appeal, Magalion contends that the District Court 
erred in denying his Amended Petition because: (1) his OVUII charge was deficient pursuant to State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 
383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), because it failed to allege that he operated his vehicle "upon a public way, street, road or highway" (public-road element); and (2) in accepting his guilty plea, the trial court did not make any inquiry into the factual basis for his guilty plea and therefore failed to satisfy itself that there was a factual basis for his plea as required by HRPP Rule 11(f) (2007). 
II. 

We resolve Magalion's arguments on appeal as follows:
 
1. Magalion does not contend that he was in fact 
operating his vehicle on a non-public road or that he suffered any prejudice from the failure of his OVUII charge to specifically allege the public-road element. 
Under similar 
circumstances, this court in Christian v. State, 131 Hawai 'i 153, 
315 P.3d 779 (App. 2013), rejected Christian's collateral attack of his OVUII conviction, which was based on the failure of his OVUII charge to allege the public-road element. Based on Christian, we conclude that Magalion is not entitled to relief on his claim that his OVUII charge was deficient for failure to allege the public-road element. 
2. Magalion argues that the trial court's violation
 
of HRPP Rule 11(f), by accepting his guilty plea without

satisfying itself that there was a factual basis for the plea,
 
requires that his OVUII conviction be vacated. Magalion,
 however, did not file a direct appeal of his conviction to raise
 this claim. See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) (stating that HRPP Rule 40
 
proceedings are not available "where the issues sought to be
 raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived"). 
Moreover, Magalion does not contend that an actual
 
factual basis for his guilty plea was lacking, that is, he does
 not contend that if requested, the prosecution would have been
 unable to establish a factual basis for his plea. Magalion also
 does not explain why his decision to plead guilty would have been
 affected if the trial court had complied with HRPP Rule 11(f) and
 required a factual basis for his plea. Under these
 circumstances, we conclude that Magalion is not entitled to have
 his OVUII conviction vacated based on the trial court's failure
 to comply with HRPP Rule 11(f). See United States v. Timmreck,
 
441 U.S. 780, 785 (1979) ("'[C]ollateral relief is not available
 when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal
 requirements of [Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
 Procedure].'" (citation omitted)).
 
III.
 
We affirm the District Court's denial of Magalion's 
Amended Petition set forth in its October 4, 2011, Order Denying
 Amended Petition.
