NOLAN FRASER,
Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, and THOMAS READ,
Defendants-Appellees 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0709(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Nolan Fraser's (Appellant 
Fraser) appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000746 from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's October 10, 2011 judgment, because the October 21, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or 
decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.] 
Id. (emphases added). Although Appellant Fraser's amended 
complaint asserted multiple claims against multiple defendants, i.e., Defendants-Appellees State of Hawai' i (Appellee State) and 
Thomas Read (Appellee Read), the October 10, 2011 judgment enters judgment only on Appellant Fraser's claims against Appellee State. The October 10, 2011 judgment neither resolves Appellee Fraser's claims against Read nor contains an express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Although the October 10, 2011 judgment contains a statement that "[n]o other claims remain in this action[,]" the Supreme Court of 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i has specifically explained that 
A statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1339 n.4 (emphases 
added). When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under
 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to case upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Because the October 10, 2011 judgment neither resolves all claims against all parties nor contains an express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), the October 10, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment in a multiple-party case under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent the entry of an appealable final judgment, the appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over the Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000746. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in Appeal No.

CAAP-11-0000746 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
