IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
TODD EUGENE HART, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 11-1-029K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Todd Eugene Hart (Hart) appeals
 
from the September 14, 2011 Judgment (judgment) of the Family
 
1
Court of the Third Circuit  (family court).  Hart was convicted
 
of violating the Family Court Order for Protection (Order)
 
entered August 2, 2010.
 
On February 9, 2011, Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai
'i (State) filed a complaint charging Hart with "knowingly 
or intentionally" violating the Order, thereby, violating Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 586-11 (2006). At the conclusion of a 
bench trial, the family court found Hart guilty. 
On September 14, 2011, the family court entered the

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment against Hart and sentenced him to imprisonment for a
 
term of 48 hours, probation for a term of 2 years, and a fine
 
including fees. On October 13, 2011, Hart filed a notice of
 
appeal.
 
On appeal, Hart contends the family court erred in
 
denying his motion for acquittal and finding him guilty of
 
violating an order for protection because the State did not
 
adduce substantial evidence to establish he knowingly or
 
intentionally or violated the order. In the alternative, Hart
 
contends the family court erred in denying his oral motion to
 
dismiss based on de minimus.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Hart's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Hart was present with an attorney when the Order was
 
issued by the family court. Hart signed the Order acknowledging
 
he received a copy. The Order, contains, in part, the following
 
language:
 
B. Contact between the Parties
 
[Hart] and/or Petitioner shall not personally contact the
 
other party and shall not visit or remain within 100 yards
of the residence or place of employment of the other party.
 
[Hart] and/or Petitioner shall not telephone the other
party. Notwithstanding the foregoing order,
Respondent/Petitioner may have limited contact with
Petitioner/Respondent with counsel present or in joint
therapy with another adult present.
The order specified that custody was joint and that
visitation was as agreed between the parties.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The undisputed evidence is that Hart spoke with the
 
Petitioner on the telephone and that Hart initiated this contact. 
The contact was not "with counsel present, or in joint therapy
 
with another adult present" as is stipulated in the Order. The

family court did not err in denying Hart's motion for judgment of
 
acquittal:
 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when
the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such
evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies
whether the case was before a judge or jury. The test on
 appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence
to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.
 
State v. Richie
, 88 Hawai' i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241
(1998) (quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai' i 128, 145, 938
P.2d 559, 576 (1997)). "'Substantial evidence' as to every
material element of the offense charged is credible evidencewhich is of sufficient quality and probative value to enablea person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion."Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 33, 960 P.2d at 1241 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The standard to be applied by the trial court in
ruling upon a motion for a judgment of acquittal is
whether, upon the evidence viewed in the light most
favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition
of the province of the trier of fact, a reasonable
mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. An appellate court employs the same standard of
review.
 
State v. Keawe, 107 Hawai' i 1, 4, 108 P.3d 304, 307 (2005)
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai' i 262, 265,
892 P.2d 455, 458 (1995)). 
State v. Bayly, 118 Hawai' i 1, 6, 185 P.3d 186, 191 (2008). 
Hart's contention the family court erred in denying his
 
motion to dismiss based on de minimus is equally without merit:
 
The dismissal of a prosecution for a de minimis
infraction is not a defense. The authority to dismiss a
prosecution as de minimis rests in the sound discretion of
the trial court. A court abuses its discretion if it
 clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules
or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant.
 
State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai' i 329, 336, 235 P.3d 325, 332 (2010) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and ellipsis
 
omitted).
 
The family court's conclusion that a knowing and
 
intentional violation of a protective order was not de minimus
 
was not a abuse of discretion.
