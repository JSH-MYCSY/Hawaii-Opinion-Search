Defendant-Appellant JP Junior Tupito, also known as JP
 
Tupito ("Tupito"), appeals from the October 3, 2011 Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence, entered by the Circuit Court of the

 Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 708-840(1)(b)(ii),
2
 one count of
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle, in violation of HRS
 § 708-836,

 HRS § 708-840(1)(b)(ii) provides that "[a] person commits the
offense of robbery in the first degree if, in the course of committing theft
or non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle . . . [t]he person is armed with a
dangerous instrument and . . . [t]he person threatens the imminent use of
force against the person of anyone present with intent to compel acquiescence
to the taking of or escaping with the property[.]" H

 HRS § 708-836 provides that "[a] person commits the offense of
unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle if the person intentionally or
knowingly exerts unauthorized control over another's propelled vehicle by
operating the vehicle without the owner's consent or by changing the identity
of the vehicle without the owner's consent." H

On appeal, Tupito contends that the Circuit Court (1)
 
"plainly erred in failing to sua sponte provide the jury with a
 
specific instruction on eyewitness identification so that the
 jury's attention would be adequately focused on the
 identification issues"; (2) "erred in denying Tupito's Motion to
 Suppress Evidence and Identification [("Motion to Suppress")]";
 and (3) erred in entering judgment against him because "[t]here
 was no substantial evidence to support Tupito's convictions." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tupito's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Because this case was pending on appeal when the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court issued its decision in State v. Cabagbag, 
127 Hawai' i 302, 277 P.3d 1027 (2012), this court "appl[ies] the 
rule then in effect when the cases were tried." Id. at 317, 277 
P.3d at 1042. At the time of the trial in this case, the judge's duty was "to determine whether the jury's attention was adequately drawn to the identification evidence." State v. 
Vinge, 81 Hawai' i 309, 316, 916 P.2d 1210, 1217 (1996) (quoting 
State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai' i 383, 405, 894 P.2d 80, 102 (1995)). 
Whether such an instruction is necessary, rests "within the sound discretion of the trial court." Cabagbag, 127 Hawai' i at 315, 
277 P.3d at 1040. 
Here, the credibility of Ansen Nicho ("Nicho"), the
 
complaining witness, and his identification of Tupito were the
 central issues at trial. Among other references, defense counsel
 asked during voir dire of a juror's personal experience with
 misidentification, defense counsel's opening statement challenged
 Nicho's physical description of Tupito, his cross-examination of
 Nicho and another witness challenged the same, and, during
 closing, he again challenged the accuracy of Nicho's
 
4/
 HRS § 708-839.55 provides that "[a] person commits the offense of
 
unauthorized possession of confidential personal information if that person
intentionally or knowingly possesses, without authorization, any confidential
personal information of another in any form, including but not limited to
mail, physical documents, identification cards, or information stored in
digital form." H
AW.  REV.  STAT. § 708-839.55 (Supp. 2012).

identification. 
We conclude, therefore, that it was not plain error in
 
the instant case for the Circuit Court to not, sua sponte, issue
 
a specific eyewitness jury instruction.
 
(2) Tupito contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
denying his Motion to Suppress, arguing that the show-up
 procedure was impermissibly suggestive and that, under the
 totality of the circumstances, Nicho's identification of Tupito
 was not sufficiently reliable. At the suppression hearing, the
 Circuit Court agreed that the show-up was impermissibly
 suggestive, and we proceed here assuming the same.
 
The reliability of an eyewitness identification of a 
suspect is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances. Okumura, 78 Hawai' i at 391, 894 P.2d at 88. The factors to be 
considered include: 
the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the
time of the crime, the witness' degree of attention, the
accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal,
the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the
confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and
the confrontation[.]
 
State v. Padilla, 57 Haw. 150, 154, 552 P.2d 357, 360 (1976)
 
(quoting Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199-200 (1972)). 
Nicho had ample opportunity to clearly view the man who
 
robbed him. He spoke with Tupito in a lighted parking lot for
 roughly three minutes, before joining Tupito and his partner in
 the car. They drove around for the next thirty minutes; although
 the interior lights were off, Nicho could still see the two men.
 They later stopped near a house. Nicho testified that one of the
 men pointed a gun at him. The area was dark, but Nicho affirmed
 that there was "lighting enough to see the face of the person,"
 explaining "[i]n the car--get lights in the car, but I recognize
 who's the one pointing with the gun." Defense counsel questioned
 Nicho about his recognition of that person. Nicho responded "I
 saw the person, and I recognize him from what I see on his face,
 around. He got—hair is short, like haircut short, then he
 wearing hat."
 
Nicho identified Tupito with certainty as the one who
 
brandished the gun. Honolulu Police Officer Zachary Plevel, who

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
escorted Nicho to the show-up, testified that Nicho identified
 
Tupito as "the guy with the gun," and that "[t]here was no
 hesitation. As soon as we . . . pulled up to the [show-up]
 location, he identified him." 
The length of time between the offense and the 
identification does not render the identification suspect. It was on the order of one hour between the time that Nicho was threatened with the gun and Nicho's in-person identification of Tupito. Cf. In re Doe, 107 Hawai' i 439, 451, 114 P.3d 945, 957 
(App. 2005) (recognizing that a period of several weeks neither favors nor casts doubt on reliability, and suggesting that a mere two-hour span is not particularly significant). 
Considering the totality of the circumstances, and even 
in light of discrepancies in Nicho's description of his assailant and Tupito's actual height, weight, and wear, we conclude that it was highly unlikely that Nicho mistakenly misidentified his assailant. Therefore, we conclude that Nicho's identification of Tupito as his assailant was sufficiently reliable to present to the jury and the Circuit Court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. See State v. Araki, 82 Hawai' i 474, 486, 923 P.2d 
891, 903 (1996) ("Thus, the weight of the identification testimony and the credibility of the witnesses were for the jury to determine. The defense counsel could cross-examine the witnesses, point out any suggestibility in the identification procedure, and present countervailing testimony such as alibi." (quoting State v. Masaniai, 63 Haw. 354, 365, 628 P.2d 1018, 1026 (1981)). 
(3) Tupito contends that his convictions must be
 
overturned for lack of substantial evidence in support. In
 particular, Tupito argues that Nicho's testimony "was rife with
 contradictions and inconsistencies," and, therefore, was not
 credible evidence upon which a conviction may stand. 
To the contrary, however, there was substantial
 
evidence to support the jury's decision. Whether Nicho's
 testimony was contradictory or inconsistent, or whether the jury
 should have believed Tupito's version of events, was a matter
 peculiarly within the jury's province to weigh the witnesses'

testimony and to evaluate their credibility. The jury clearly 
credited Nicho's testimony over Tupito's, and it is not our place to second-guess its assessment. See State v. Mattiello, 90 
Hawai'i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) ("Verdicts based on 
conflicting evidence will not be set aside where there is substantial evidence to support the trier of fact's findings." (quoting Tsugawa v. Reinartz, 56 Haw. 67, 71, 527 P.2d 1278, 1282 (1974) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted))). 
Considering the evidence, as we must, in the light most
 
favorable to the State, there was substantial evidence to support
 Tupito's convictions. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence entered on October 3, 2011 is affirmed.
