Pursuant to its Amended Final Judgment, the circuit
 
court entered judgment partly in favor of Plaintiffs and partly
 
in favor of the State on all counts of Plaintiffs' complaint.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 14, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a complaint
 
challenging the State's transfer of approximately 15,200 active
 
and retired public school teachers and their dependants
 
(collectively, Teachers) into the Employer-Union Health Benefits
 
Trust Fund (EUTF).
 
In 2005, the Hawai' i State Legislature (Legislature) 
enacted Act 245 (partially codified in HRS Chapter 87D (2005), 
repealed by 2010 Haw. Sess. L. Act 106, §§ 1-2 at 198). Act 245 
authorized the Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association Trust 
(VEBA Trust) to provide health benefits to teachers, beginning on 
March 1, 2006. However, on December 31, 2010, Act 245 terminated 
pursuant to its sunset provision. See 2005 Haw. Sess. L. Act 
245, § 8 at 767. As a result, the Teachers were transferred from the VEBA Trust into the EUTF. 
Based on the transfer and on the State's allegedly 
wrongful taking of surplus funds from the VEBA Trust, Plaintiffs 
filed the underlying complaint against the State on the Teachers' 
behalf. The complaint alleged claims for violations of article 
XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution (for diminishing and 
impairing accured benefits and the source of accrued benefits), breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and injunctive and 
2
 Plaintiffs' notice of appeal from the Order Denying Plaintiffs'
Fees and Costs was docketed as appeal number CAAP 12-0000004. On January 19,
2012, this court entered an order consolidating appellate court case number
CAAP 12-0000004 under appellate court case number CAAP-11-0000755.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declaratory relief. The State filed its answer on October 4,
 
2010.
 
On October 12, 2010, the State filed a motion for 
judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(c) (MJP). On November 4, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction (MPI), 
seeking to maintain the status quo and prevent the transfer of 
Teachers from the VEBA Trust to the EUTF. 
The circuit court heard both parties' motions on
 
December 7, 2010. After hearing arguments, the court announced
 
it was denying both motions. The court also issued extensive
 
oral rulings that appeared to resolve the merits of the complaint
 
partly in Plaintiffs' favor and partly in the State's favor. The
 
Amended Final Judgment (discussed further below) summarizes the
 
court's oral rulings. At the end of the hearing, Plaintiffs'
 
counsel volunteered to prepare the order denying the MJP and the
 
MPI, and the court agreed. The court did not, however, order
 
either party to prepare a judgment, nor did it give any
 
indication it intended to enter a judgment at that time. 
The parties participated in a status conference on
 
January 6, 2011, during which the circuit court apparently
 
indicated its view that it had resolved all issues and that the
 
case was appropriate for final judgment. Plaintiffs submitted a
 
proposed order, to which the State objected. The State then
 
twice submitted proposed orders "granting in part and denying in
 
part" the State's MJP. In its second submission, the State also
 
included a proposed final judgment. Plaintiffs opposed both
 
submissions, objecting to the form of the proposed orders and
 
arguing that entry of a final judgment was procedurally improper. 
On March 15, 2011, the circuit court entered its (1)
 
Order Denying State's MJP; (2) Order Denying Plaintiffs' MPI; and
 
(3) Final Judgment. The Final Judgment stated "[a]ny remaining
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties and/or claims are dismissed," but it failed to
 
specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit
 
court intended to enter judgment. At the time the circuit court
 
entered the Final Judgment, there were no pending motions from
 
either party. 
On April 11, 2011, the State filed a notice of appeal 
from the Final Judgment. On June 30, 2011, this court dismissed 
the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the Final Judgment 
failed to satisfy the requirements of HRCP Rule 58 or the holding 
in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 
P.2d 1334 (1994). 
On July 11, 2011, Plaintiffs filed "Plaintiffs' Motion
 
for Leave to File First Amended Complaint." On July 20, 2011,
 the circuit court entered its Order Denying Amendment, concluding
 
the motion was "untimely" because all the claims had been
 
resolved pursuant to its Final Judgment.
 
On October 6, 2011, the circuit court entered its
 
Amended Final Judgment, pursuant to its December 7, 2010 oral
 
rulings. In its Amended Final Judgment, the circuit court set
 
forth the following:
 
(a)	 Act 106, Session Laws of Hawai' i 2010 ("Act 106"),3 
does not violate Article XVI, Section 2 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution ("Art XVI, § 2"); 
(b) 	The transfer of active and retired teachers who 
participated in the health benefits plans of the Hawai' i 
3 In Act 106, the Legislature declared it had no intention to make
Act 245 permanent or extend the sunset date further. Section 1 of Act 106
 stated, in pertinent part:
 
The legislature finds that the enabling law for the [VEBA
Trust], an alternative health-benefits system used by the
employee organization for public school teachers, will
sunset on July 1, 2010. The legislature declares that it
does not intend to make the enabling law permanent or extend
the sunset date for another pilot testing period.
 
2010 Haw. Sess. L. Act 106, § 1 at 198.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State Teachers Association Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary
Association Trust ("VEBA members") to the health benefitsplans of the Hawai' i Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust
Fund ("EUTF"), effective January 1, 2011, pursuant to Act106, does not violate Art. XVI, § 2 nor does it breach anycontract between VEBA members and the State of Hawai' i 
("State"); 
(c) 	Former VEBA members who transfer to the EUTF pursuant
to Act 106 are entitled to maintain the same standard 
of coverage benefits in their EUTF health benefits
plans;
 
(d) 	To the extent that the surplus funds that the VEBA
Trust returned to the State were part of accrued benefits of
the VEBA members who paid into the surplus, such funds
shall be used by the State to ensure that VEBA members can
maintain their standard of coverage benefits, as provided in
this Final Judgment[.]
 
Based on the above, the circuit court entered judgment partly in
 
favor of Plaintiffs and partly in favor of the State on all
 
counts.
 
The circuit court also entered an "Order Denying
 
[State's] Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees, Filed March 29,
 
2011" on May 17, 2011, and a post-judgment "Order Denying
 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs Filed October
 
20, 2011" on December 1, 2011.
 
On October 14, 2011, the State filed a timely notice of
 
appeal from the Amended Judgment, and Plaintiffs filed a notice
 
of cross-appeal on November 4, 2011.
 
On appeal, the State contends the circuit court erred:
 (1) in holding that "the teachers in the VEBA Trust
 
have constitutionally protected accrued benefits based on their
 past service" and are entitled to maintain the same standard of
 
coverage benefits in their EUTF health benefits plans; 
(2) in ordering the VEBA Trust surplus funds be used
 
to ensure the Teachers maintain the same standard of coverage
 
benefits; and
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) in entering its MJP Denial Order and its order
 
denying the State's motion for attorneys' fees.
 
On cross-appeal, Plaintiffs contend the circuit court
 
erred:
 
(1) in determining Act 245 (and its subsequent 
amendments) and the State's taking of the VEBA Trust surplus did 
not violate article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai' i Constitution; 
(2) in determining Act 245 and the taking of the
 
surplus did not violate the Teachers' contractual rights; 
(3) in entering its MPI Denial Order, its Order
 
Denying Amendment, and its order denying Plaintiffs' motion for
 
attorneys' fees and costs; and
 
(4) in issuing the Amended Final Judgment after
 
denying the State's MJP.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Questions of law are reviewed upon appeal under the 
right/wrong standard of review. Maile Sky Court Co., Ltd. v. 
City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 85 Hawai' i 36, 39, 936 P.2d 672, 675 
(1997). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs raise a challenge to the procedural
 
propriety of the circuit court's decision, arguing the circuit
 
court lacked authority to render its decision in the absence of
 
an appropriate pending motion from either party. We agree with
 
Plaintiffs' argument. 
The State contends that, based on the content of the
 
circuit court's oral ruling and its Amended Final Judgment, it is
 
apparent the circuit court intended to partially grant the
 
State's MJP with respect to all claims in Plaintiffs' complaint. 
Specifically, the circuit court concluded that Act 245 was not a
 
violation of the non-impairment clause or a breach of contract,
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and that the State was allowed to retain the VEBA Trust surplus
 
funds. The Final Judgment stated it was based on an "Order
 
Granting In Part And Denying In Part State Defendants' Motion for
 
Judgment On The Pleadings, Filed October 12, 2010, And Entering
 
Summary Judgment Partly In Favor Of Plaintiffs And Partly In
 
Favor Of Defendants."
 
No such order exists in the record.4 The written order
 
the circuit court entered was the "Order Denying State's MJP." 
The circuit court's decision to deny the MJP in its entirety was
 
apparently deliberate. At the hearing on the MJP and Plaintiffs'
 
MPI, the circuit court expressly stated it was denying both
 
motions. The circuit court also chose not to adopt either of the
 
State's two proposed orders, which would have granted in part and
 
denied in part the MJP, and instead entered Plaintiffs' proposed
 
order denying the MJP.
 
The written order, which denied the MJP in its
 
entirety, controls over the oral statements the circuit court
 
made. Nat'l Home Centers, Inc. v. Coleman, 257 S.W.3d 862, 863
 
(Ark. 2007) ("If a trial court's ruling from the bench is not
 reduced to writing and filed of record, it is free to alter its
 
decision upon further consideration of the matter. Simply put,
 
the written order controls.") (Citation omitted.); Lind v.
 
Raynor, 243 P.2d 783 (Nev. 1952); Owens v. Magill, 419 S.E.2d 786
 
(S.C. 1992) (holding that a judge was not bound by prior oral
 
ruling and could issue written order which conflicted with prior
 
oral ruling); Ladd by Ladd v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., 939 S.W.2d
 
83, 104 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996) ("A court speaks only through its
 
written orders."); In re JDN Real Estate-McKinney L.P., 211
 
4
 Other than this reference to a non-existent order, nothing in the
record indicates the court disposed of the case by summary judgment, either on
its own initiative or by treating the State's MJP as a motion for summary
judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(c).
 
8
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
S.W.3d 907 (Tex. App. 2006); Fredericksburg Const. Co., Inc. v.
 
J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc., 530 S.E.2d 148, 152 (Va. 2000);
 
Ratcliff v. Cyrus, 544 S.E.2d 93, 96 n. 14 (W. Va. 2001) ("[W]hen
 
presented with conflicting signals from a circuit court, the law
 
favors written orders over oral statements.").
 
When the circuit court entered its Final Judgment and
 
its Amended Final Judgment, there was no pending dispositive
 
motion on which the circuit court could terminate the litigation. 
Nothing in the HRCP or the RCCH grants the circuit court the
 
authority, after a complaint and answer has been filed, to sua
 
sponte enter a final judgment without a stipulation of the
 
parties or pursuant to a previous order of the court. Although
 
the State claims judgment on the pleadings was warranted as a
 
matter of law, the State failed to cite any argument or authority
 
in its briefs or at oral argument supporting the circuit court's
 
filing a final judgment sua sponte and contrary to its prior
 
orders.5
 
Because the circuit court's procedure in entering
 
judgment was premature and without basis in any authority, we
 
vacate the Amended Final Judgment. We further vacate the Order
 
Denying Amendment and the orders denying the parties' attorneys'
 
fees and costs.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we vacate the
 (1) March 15, 2011 "Final Judgment Partly in Favor of
 
Plaintiffs and Partly in Favor of Defendants";
 
(2) May 17, 2011 "Order Denying State Defendants'
 
Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees, Filed March 29, 2011";
 
5
 We also find no authority for the circuit court's action in
issuing the "Order Denying Plaintiffs' MPI" and then, within that same order,
ordering the State to apply the VEBA Trust's surplus funds "to ensure that
[Teachers] transitioning from the VEBA Trust receive the same standard of
coverage that they received while in the VEBA Trust."

Favor of Plaintiffs and Partly in Favor of Defendants." We
 
remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this
 
opinion.
