APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-1469)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Michael Robles (Robles) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered October 12,
 
1
2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  
On September 9, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) 
indicted Robles for second degree murder in the death of Charlys 
Tang (Tang), which occurred May 1, 2010. In a jury-waived trial, 
the circuit court found Robles guilty of manslaughter in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-702 (Supp. 
1

2011) and sentenced Robles to incarceration for a term of twenty
 
years and $10,000 in restitution. 
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this

appeal is without merit.

On appeal, Robles contends the circuit court erred in

finding him guilty of reckless manslaughter despite a lack of

sufficient evidence. Robles claims the record does not support

the finding that but for Robles's reckless conduct, Tang would

not have died.

The test to determine sufficiency of the evidence is 
whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion of the trier 
of fact. State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 
322, 330-31 (2007). This court need not determine whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether substantial 
evidence supports each material element of the offense. Id. 
Substantial evidence is "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a [person] of reasonable 
caution to support a conclusion." State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 
248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992). Evidence must be "viewed in light most favorable to the prosecution[.]" State v. Bayly, 118 
Hawai'i 1, 6, 185 P.3d 186, 191 (2008) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
In this case, the circuit court convicted Robles of

manslaughter. The State had the burden to produce credible
 
evidence that Robles caused the death of Tang and that Robles did

so recklessly. State v. Knight, 80 Hawai' i 318, 325, 909 P.2d 
1133, 1140 (1996). 
The State presented eyewitness testimony that three

males were quarreling in front of a taxicab in Waipahu and soon

after two males were seen running from the area. The eyewitness
 
found Tang, the driver of the taxicab, laying face-up in a pool

of blood. Robles testified that on May 1, 2010, he and Kilani

Derego (Derego) traveled by taxicab to Waipahu. Robles testified

that after the taxicab arrived in Waipahu, an altercation took

place between the driver, Tang, and Derego. On cross-
examination, Robles testified to kicking Tang more than once

during the altercation and that he may have kicked Tang in the

head. Robles practiced Muay Thai and mixed martial arts. A

medical expert testified that Tang died from complications of

blunt force trauma to the brain. Clearly, sufficient evidence

supports Robles's conviction.

Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction

and Sentence entered October 12, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the

First Circuit is affirmed.
