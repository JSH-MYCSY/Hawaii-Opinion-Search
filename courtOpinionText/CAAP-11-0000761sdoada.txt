Servicing, LP (BAC) and Bank of America, N.A. and against Mariani.
 
On appeal, Mariani contends the circuit court erred in:
 
(1)
 concluding Mariani's claim for injunctive and
 
declaratory relief was moot;
 
(2) denying Mariani's motion for leave to amend his
 
complaint; and
 
(3) granting BAC's motion for summary judgment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Mariani's appeal is without merit.
 
(1) Mariani contends the circuit court erred in
 
holding his claim for injunctive relief was moot. On November
 
13, 2009, Mariani filed his Complaint seeking injunctive relief
 
to enjoin BAC from conducting a foreclosure sale of his residence
 
but did not properly serve the Complaint or initially file proof
 
of service of the Complaint. BAC conducted the foreclosure sale
 
on March 5, 2010, releasing Mariani from any interest in the
 
property and effectively nullifying his request to enjoin the
 
sale.
 
"A case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer 
grant effective relief." Kemp v. State of Hawai' i Child Support 
Enforcement Agency, 111 Hawai' i 367, 385, 141 P.3d 1014, 1032 
(2006) (internal quotation marks, citation and brackets 
omitted). With the sale already finalized and recorded, the 
circuit court could not grant the relief requested by Mariani. 
Therefore, Mariani's request for injunctive relief was moot. See 
McCabe Hamilton & Renny Co., Ltd. v. Chung, 98 Hawai' i 107, 117, 
43 P.3d 244, 254 (App. 2002). 
(2) Mariani requested leave to amend his complaint in
 
his Memorandum in Opposition to BAC's Motion to Dismiss and
 
2

Motion for Summary Judgment. Mariani did not include the 
proposed amended complaint in support of his request as required 
by Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 15(a)(2) or an 
explanation of how his Complaint would be amended. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
Mariani's motion for leave to amend his complaint. Jou v. Dai-
Tokyo Royal State Ins. Co., 116 Hawai' i 159, 163, 172 P.3d 471, 
475 (2007). 
Furthermore, a motion to amend a complaint is not a 
"vehicle to circumvent summary judgment." Federal Home Loans 
Mortg. Corp. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 89 Hawai' i 157, 162, 969 
P.2d 1275, 1280 (1998) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). 
(3) Mariani contends the circuit court erred in
 
granting BAC's Motion for Summary Judgment. In support of their
 
Motion for Summary Judgment, BAC presented evidence that it had
 
the legal right, as supported by documentation, to foreclose
 
under the mortgage. Though Mariani argues BAC did not hold the
 
mortgage, Mariani himself, presented evidence of a recorded
 
Assignment of Mortgage transferring the right, title, and
 
interest in the mortgage from Mortgage Electronic Registration
 
Systems, Inc., as a nominee for Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., to
 
BAC. Additionally, Mariani does not dispute that he was in
 
default on the mortgage. Given the evidence produced by BAC to
 
support its motion for summary judgment, HRCP 56 obligated
 
Mariani to produce evidence to show that a genuine issue of
 
material fact remained to be adjudicated. Because Mariani did not
 
do so, the circuit court did not err in granting summary
 
judgment.
