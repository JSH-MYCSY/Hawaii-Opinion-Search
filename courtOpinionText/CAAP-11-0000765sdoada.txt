STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MATTHEW LOCKEY, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 11-1-1241)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise and Ginoza, JJ. with
Nakamura, C.J. dissenting separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Matthew C. Lockey (Lockey) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on
 
September 28, 2011 in the Family Court of the First Circuit
 
(family court).1
 
Lockey was convicted of Harassment, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106 (Supp. 2011).2

 The Honorable Wilson M.N. Loo presided.

 HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) states:
 
§711-1106 Harassment.  (1) A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other
person, that person:
(a)	 Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another
person in an offensive manner or subjects the other
person to offensive physical contact[.]

On appeal, Lockey contends that (1) the family court erred
 
by denying his oral motion to dismiss the charge on due process
 
grounds because it was defective for failing to provide Lockey
 
with notice of the prohibited conduct and (2) there was
 
insufficient evidence to convict him of harassment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Lockey's points of error as follows:
 
On March 1, 2011, a complaint was filed charging that
 
Lockey committed the offense of harassment. Subsequently, on
 
May 27, 2011, after the deputy prosecutor formally arraigned
 
Lockey and described the charge against him, Lockey made an oral
 
motion to dismiss the case because the charge of harassment was
 
made in the disjunctive and failed to provide notice as to the
 
actual charge. The family court denied the motion and the case
 
proceeded to bench trial that day.
 
The State contends that Lockey waived his objection to
 
the charge because it was untimely. The State contends that
 
Lockey was ordered to file all pretrial motions 72 hours in
 
advance of trial and failed to timely object to the lack of fair
 
notice in the complaint. We do not agree.
 
A charge that fails to sufficiently apprise a defendant 
of what he or she must be prepared to meet is a defective charge 
that fails to state an offense. State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 
312, 316, 55 P.3d 276, 280 (2002). As even the State notes in its answering brief, objections to defects in a charge based on a 
failure to charge an offense "shall be noticed by the court at 
any time during the pendency of the proceedings[.]" Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), Rule 12(b)(2). Thus, Lockey was not precluded from raising his objection to the complaint in this 
case, even though it was not raised 72 hours in advance of trial. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The State further argues that Lockey had both the
 
complaint and discovery for this case for almost three months
 
prior to raising his objection to the charge. "[I]n construing
 
the validity of an oral charge, we are not restricted to an
 
examination solely of the charge, but will interpret it in light
 
of all of the information provided to the accused." Sprattling
 
at 319, 55 P.3d at 283 (citation omitted). The State fails,
 however, to establish the type of information that was provided
 
to Lockey in discovery and fails to point to anything in the
 
record establishing the information that Lockey had, besides the
 
complaint. This argument, therefore, is not helpful to the
 
State.
 
The written complaint and the oral charge read to
 
Lockey on the day of trial were pled in the disjunctive, which
 
did not sufficiently apprise Lockey of what he must be prepared
 
to meet. See State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 283 n.4, 567 P.2d
 
1242, 1245 n.4 (1977). Under HRS § 711-1106(1)(a), there are
 multiple types of contact that could result in a conviction for
 
harassment if the other elements are met.
 
In State v. Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai' i 290, 22 P.3d 86 
(App. 2001), the defendant claimed that knocking off a person's 
hat did not constitute "touching another person in an offensive 
manner or subjecting the other person to offensive physical 
contact." 95 Hawai' i at 294, 22 P.3d at 90 (brackets omitted). 
In Pesentheiner, this court stated: 
The statute thus expressly proscribes contact
with an individual's person by way of a "strike[],
shove[], kick[]," or other method of "touching[.]"
However, HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) also prohibits, in the
disjunctive and alternatively, acts which "subject[]
[another] person to offensive physical contact[.]"
 
On appeal, the State contends that
Pesentheiner's conduct falls within the first of these
 prohibitions. We question this parsing of the
statute. On its face, HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) strains to
support a construction that defines the phrase
"[s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person" as anything less than actual bodily
contact, whether directly or indirectly through the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
clothing or other material intended to cover the body.
Such a construction would be contrary to the
commonsense understanding imparted by the statute's
choice of words.
 
That said, we move to examine whether
Pesentheiner nonetheless violated the alternative
 prohibition of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a), against
"offensive physical contact[.]" Pesentheiner argues
that "offensive physical contact" should be strictly
construed to mean only actual contact with or touching
of another individual's person. However, as stated
above, the plain language of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a)
makes clear that the statute already proscribes such
actions in its first prohibition against
"[s]trik[ing], shov[ing], kick[ing], or otherwise
touch[ing] another person[.]"
 
As a general rule, "[c]ourts are bound to give
effect to all parts of a statute, and . . . no clause,
sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous,
void, or insignificant if a construction can be
legitimately found which will give force to and
preserve all words of the statute." In re Doe, 90
Haw. 246, 250, 978 P.2d 684, 688 (1999). 
In light of
this consideration, it becomes apparent that
"offensive physical contact" must constitute more than
simply the "touch[ing] [of] another person in an
offensive manner" if the phrase in the disjunctive is
to hold any independent meaning or effect.
 
We believe that "offensive physical contact"
encompasses the conduct in question here, offensive
contact that, while separate and apart from the
various forms of actual bodily touching, nevertheless
involves contact with an item physically appurtenant
to the body. We believe that such a construction is
mandated by the plain meaning of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a),
read in its entirety.
 
Id. at 294-95, 22 P.3d at 90-91 (brackets in original, emphasis
 
added and footnotes omitted). Because "offensive physical
 
contact" has an independent meaning from "touching of another
 
person in an offensive manner," the terms are not synonymous and
 
the former is not inclusive of the latter. 
As the Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated many years ago: 
In charging the defendant in the disjunctive rather than in
the conjunctive, it left the defendant uncertain as to whichof the acts charged was being relied upon as the basis forthe accusation against him. Where a statute specifiesseveral ways in which its violation may occur, the chargemay be laid in the conjunctive but not in the disjunctive.

Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 283 n.4, 567 P.2d at 1245 n.4. Moreover,
 
in State v. McCarthy, 124 Hawai' i 129, 237 P.3d 1195, No. 29701 
2010 WL 3433722 at *4 (App. Aug. 31, 2010) (mem.), this court
 stated:
 
[a]lternatively, this court has recommended that the
better approach is to phrase the complaint in both the
conjunctive and the disjunctive. "[T]he most
appropriate method to allege one offense committed in
two different ways is to allege in one count that the
defendant committed the offense (a) in one way
'and/or' (b) in a second way." State v. Cabral, 8 Haw.
App. 506, 511, 810 P.2d 672, 675-76 (1991). The
supreme court has expressed agreement. State v.
 Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 250, 831 P.2d 924, 932 (1992).
 
(footnote omitted).
 
Because the charge in this case failed to sufficiently
 
apprise Lockey of what he must be prepared to meet, the charge
 
failed to state an offense. We need not address Lockey's claim
 
that there was insufficient evidence to convict him.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, filed on September 28, 2011 in the Family Court of
 the First Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded with
 
instructions to dismiss the case without prejudice.
