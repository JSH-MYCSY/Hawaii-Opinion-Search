IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
KALE J. THOMPSON, Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
ROBERT E. LUECKE, Defendant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CICRUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-1700)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kale J. Thompson ("Thompson")
 
appeals from the September 28, 2011 Order Denying Defendant's
 
Motion to Vacate Judgment of Bail Forfeiture and Reinstate Bail,
 entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
 Court").

On appeal, Thompson contends that the Circuit Court:
 
(1) erred in holding that, under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
 § 804-51, he did not have standing to move to vacate the judgment
 of forfeiture; (2) abused its discretion by denying Thompson's
 request for a continuance and, instead, issuing a bench warrant
 on August 11, 2011; (3) erred in issuing the bench warrant based
 on a finding of fact that a previous bench warrant had been
 issued and recalled on account of Thompson's tardiness; (4) erred
 in scheduling a hearing on Thompson's motion to recall the bench
 warrant twenty-six days after it was filed; and (5) erred in

denying a motion to shorten time for hearing on the motion to

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 address Thompson's points of error as follows:
 
We review the question of standing de novo. Haw. Med. 
Ass’n v. Haw. Med. Serv. Ass’n, 113 Hawai' i 77, 90, 148 P.3d 
1179, 1192 (2006). The plain language of HRS § 804-51 unambiguously grants the principal, in this case Thompson, standing to file a motion to vacate the judgment. 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits
any bond or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the
court shall immediately enter up judgment in favor of the
State and against the principal or principals and surety or
sureties on the bond, jointly and severally, for the full
amount of the penalty thereof, and shall cause execution to
issue thereon immediately after the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given via personal service
or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the surety
or sureties on the bond, of the entry of the judgment in
favor of the State, unless before the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given to the surety or
sureties on the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor
of the State, a motion or application of the principal or
 principals, surety or sureties, or any of them, showing good
cause why execution should not issue upon the judgment, is
filed with the court. 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 804-51 (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added); see also 
State v. Camara, 81 Hawai' i 324, 329–30, 916 P.2d 1225, 1230–31 
(1996) (determining the circumstances under which a principal or 
a surety may secure relief from a judgment of forfeiture). 
The State concedes that the statutory language of HRS 
§ 804-51 allows Thompson to independently file a motion to vacate the judgment of bail forfeiture. The State argues, however, that the Circuit Court did not err because Exodus Bail Bonds ("Exodus"), as surety, was a necessary party to Thompson's motion to vacate the judgment of bail forfeiture. To this end, the State argues that Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 
19 is implicated. This argument is without merit.

HRCP Rule 19 does not apply to "proceedings for the
 
forfeiture of bonds" within HRS § 804-51.2 Haw. R. Civ. P.
 
81(a)(8) (2011); see also Haw. R. Civ. P. 1.3 The State
 
explicitly concedes this fact. Nevertheless, the State argues
 
that lack of a mandatory joinder rule in bond forfeiture
 proceedings does not prevent a circuit court from using its
 "inherent power" to "protect itself" and "administer justice" by
 "provid[ing] process where none exists." See State v. Moriwake,
 
65 Haw. 47, 55, 647 P.2d 705, 712 (1982). Accordingly, the State
 argues that the Circuit Court "would not have erred in concluding
 that a rule similar to HRCP Rule 19 should apply in proceedings
 for forfeiture of bonds." 
The State's argument is unpersuasive. The Hawai'i
 
Rules of Civil Procedure expressly state that HRCP Rule 19 does
 not apply. There is no alternative rule requiring mandatory
 joinder of Exodus. Furthermore, the Circuit Court did not
 exercise its inherent power to provide process. As a party,
 Exodus had received notice of Thompson's motion.
4 Its decision
 
not to participate does not deprive the Circuit Court of
 jurisdiction. Therefore, the Circuit Court's conclusion that it
 lacked jurisdiction to rule on Thompson's Motion to Vacate
 Judgment of Bail Forfeiture and Reinstate Bail was in error. As
 to the remaining points of error, Thompson has failed to show
 
2/
 HRCP Rule 81(a)(8) provides that the Hawai'i Rules of Civil
Procedure "shall not apply . . . to [p]roceedings for the forfeiture of bonds
under section 709-51, as the same may be renumbered[.]" Haw. R. Civ. P.
 81(a)(8) (2006). Effective January 1, 1973, Section 709-51 was renumbered as
HRS Section 804-51. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 139, 142.
 
3/
 HRCP Rule 1 states that "[t]hese rules govern the procedure in the
circuit courts of the State in all suits of a civil nature whether cognizable
as cases at law or in equity, with the exceptions stated in Rule 81." Haw. R.
 Civ. P. 1 (2012). 
4/
 Furthermore, Exodus was necessarily aware of the fact that
Thompson's motion could lead to the award of costs because, by statute, the
text of HRS § 804-51, which explicitly states that costs may be subtracted,
"shall be considered to be set forth in full in words and figures in, and to
form a part of, and to be included in, each and every bond or recognizance
given in a criminal cause, whether actually set forth in the bond or
recognizance, or not." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 804-51.

We vacate the September 28, 2011 Order Denying

 Thompson failed to cause the transcript of proceedings held on
August 11, 2011 to be a part of the record on appeal, therefore, we are unable
to review the alleged errors.
