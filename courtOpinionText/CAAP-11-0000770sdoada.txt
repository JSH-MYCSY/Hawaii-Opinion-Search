APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2381)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Emilia Sambo Holcomb (Holcomb) 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit 
Court's) September 23, 2011 Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 54(b)-certified Judgment on Order Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale of Property at 
Public Auction, Directing Distribution of Proceeds and for a Writ

the Circuit Court's September 23, 2011 Order Approving Report of
 Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale of Property at
 Public Auction, Directing Distribution of Proceeds and for a Writ
 of Possession (Order Confirming Sale), as well as the Circuit
 
Court's November 9, 2011 Order Denying [Holcomb's] Combined
 
2
Motions  to (1) Set Aside Entry of Default; (2) Motion for Rule

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
60 Relief from Judgment; and (3) Emergency Motion for Stay of
 
Proceedings and Ejectment, Filed August 18, 2011 (Order Denying
Relief).
 
Holcomb raises the following points of error on appeal:
 
(1) the Circuit Court erred by confirming the sale of
 
the subject property;
 
(2) the Circuit Court erred by not permitting Holcomb
 
to set aside the default and/or allowing her HRCP Rule 60 relief
 from the foreclosure order and judgment; and
 
(3) the Circuit Court erred by granting summary
 
judgment in the underlying foreclosure because genuine issues of
 material fact existed. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve Holcomb's points of error as
 follows:
 
Before addressing Holcomb's contention that the Circuit
 
Court erred in conjunction with the confirmation of the sale of
 the subject property, we consider the Order Denying Relief, which
 rejected Holcomb's requests for relief from the earlier,
 unappealed, foreclosure order and judgment.
 
On September 16, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank
 
National Association (US Bank) filed Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants
 
on Complaint Filed October 13, 2009 (Motion for Summary
Judgment). On December 21, 2010, the Circuit Court entered its
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting the
 
Motion for Summary Judgment (FOFs, COLs, and Order Granting
Summary Judgment) and a Judgment on the FOFs, COLs, and Order
 
Granting Summary Judgment (Judgment on Foreclosure). Holcomb was
 
denied relief from these rulings in the Order Denying Relief.
 
To consider Holcomb's arguments regarding the Order
 
Denying Relief, we first must determine whether this court has
 
appellate jurisdiction to review it.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
4(a)(1) mandates that a notice of appeal "shall be filed within 
30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order," and failure to timely appeal is considered "a jurisdictional defect which cannot be waived by the parties or disregarded by the court in the exercise of its discretion." See Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 430, 16 P.3d 827, 835 (App. 2000) 
(citing Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986)). HRAP Rule 4(a)(2), however, provides that a judgment or order may in some cases be considered timely, despite being filed prematurely, stating: "If a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal." 
Holcomb filed the Combined Motions on August 18, 2011
 
(the same day that the Circuit Court announced its ruling
 confirming the sale of the subject property). On September 20,
 2011, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the Combined Motions
 and took the matter under advisement. Through a minute order
 issued on September 26, 2011, the court informed the parties that
 the requested relief was denied, thereby constituting an
 "announcement of a decision" under HRAP Rule 4(a)(2). 
On October 21, 2011, Holcomb filed a Notice of Appeal
 
from the Order Confirming Sale and Judgment Confirming Sale (both
 entered on September 23, 2011). Subsequently, on November 9,
 2011, the Circuit Court entered its Order Denying Relief. No
 further notice of appeal was filed.
 
The jurisdictional question is, therefore, whether
 
Holcomb's October 21, 2011 Notice of Appeal constitutes a timely
 appeal from the Order Denying Relief. First, we note that the
 Notice of Appeal failed to designate or in any way mention the
 Circuit Court's ruling on Holcomb's Combined Motions. HRAP Rule
 3(c)(2) provides that "[t]he notice of appeal shall designate the
 judgment, order, or part thereof and the court or agency appealed
 from" and that "[a] copy of the judgment or order shall be
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attached as an exhibit." However, the rule also states that
 
"[a]n appeal shall not be dismissed for informality of form or
 title of the notice of appeal." HRAP Rule 3(c)(2).
 
In Chun v. Bd. of Trustees of Employees' Ret. Sys. of 
State of Hawaii, 92 Hawai
'i 432, 448, 992 P.2d 127, 143 (2000), 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court dismissed the appellants' claim under 
HRAP Rule 3(c)(2) for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the appellants failed to designate the subject order in their notices of appeal, stating: 
The notice of appeal shall designate the judgment,
order, or part thereof appealed from.•HRAP Rule 3(c) (1996).
Inasmuch as Retirees did not, in either of their notices of
appeal, designate the July 17, 1998 order as an order from
which an appeal was being taken, they have not properly
appealed it. Accordingly, we lack appellate jurisdiction
over the propriety of the circuit court's refusal to
disqualify [attorney].
 
(Internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.)
 
The Supreme Court has also held that the designation 
requirement "should not result in loss of the appeal as long as 
the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misled by the mistake." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai
'i 228, 235, 74 P.3d 980, 
987 (2003) (emphasis and citations omitted); see also City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Midkiff, 57 Haw. 273, 275-76, 554 P.2d 233, 235 (1976) (notice of appeal from a judgment was valid despite that it mistakenly designated an incorrect date for the appealed judgment); Munoz v. Chandler, 98 Hawai
'i 80, 91, 42 P.3d 657, 668 
(App. 2002) ("[a]lthough not titled 'Notice of Appeal,' the document fairly communicated the Muñozes intent to appeal" and thus was sufficient for jurisdictional purposes (internal quotation marks and original brackets omitted)); State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai
'i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000) 
(notice of appeal from a judgment was valid, despite that it designated a nonexistent judgment, because it was obvious that appellant was "appealing from the only extant judgment" in the case). 
In this case, however, Holcomb's failure to designate
 
the Order Denying Relief (or the underlying ruling) in her Notice
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Appeal is not merely a technical mistake in form, such as 
writing down the wrong date or including the wrong title; rather, it involved a complete omission, with Holcomb attaching and referencing only the Order Confirming Sale and Judgment Confirming Sale and making no mention whatsoever of the court's ruling on her request for relief. We cannot fairly infer from the October 21, 2011 Notice of Appeal that Holcomb intended to appeal from the Circuit Court's denial of her Combined Motions for relief from the FOFs, COLs, and Order Granting Summary Judgment and Judgment on Foreclosure. See Bohannon, 102 Hawai
'i 
228, 235, 74 P.3d 980, 987 (2003) (stating that "a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should not result in loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misled by the mistake" (emphasis altered and citations omitted)); Chun, 92 Hawai
'i at 448, 992 P.2d at 143. Accordingly, we 
conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the Order Denying Relief. 
Holcomb also asserts that the Circuit Court erred when
 
it confirmed the sale of the subject property, and raises
 numerous related allegations and arguments. Holcomb first argues
 that she "filed a timely opposition to the motion to confirm
 sale," that she was entitled to oppose the motion even with a
 prior default entry, and that she moved to set aside the default
 and for relief. In making these arguments, though, Holcomb fails
 to explain how these assertions lead to the conclusion that the
 Circuit Court erred in some manner regarding its confirmation of
 the sale, or to cite any authorities supporting this proposition,
 and we find none. 
Holcomb also raises an alleged title defect, which
 
purportedly precluded a non-judicial foreclosure, and various
 other alleged problems, irregularities, and defects relating to
 the underlying note and mortgage and the assignment thereof. 
However, these issues should have been raised in opposition to
 and/or on timely appeal from the Circuit Court's FOFs, COLs, and
 Order Granting Summary Judgment and Judgment on Foreclosure

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and/or the Order Denying Relief and are not properly raised on 
appeal from the Judgment Confirming Sale. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(1); 
Sec. Pac. Mortg. Corp. v. Miller, 71 Haw. 65, 71, 783 P.2d 855, 858 (1989) (appellate "jurisdiction is limited to review of issues within the parameters of the orders from which timely appeal is taken" (citation omitted)); Cook v. Sur. Life Ins., Co., 79 Hawai
'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) ("this 
court will only consider other orders which were preliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was predicated or were part of the series of orders which collectively led to that Order" (citations omitted)). 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's September 23,
 
2011 Judgment Confirming Sale is affirmed.
