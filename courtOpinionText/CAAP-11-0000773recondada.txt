NO. CAAP-11-0000773
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
BARBARA ELLEN SHERRILL, Petitioner-Appellant
v.
 
ESTATE OF THOMAS MICHAEL PICO, JR.,
also known as, THOMAS M. PICO, JR., Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(P.
 NO. 10-1-0254 (Formal))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITIONER-APPELLANT BARBARA ELLEN SHERRILL'S
 
(1) 
MOTION TO ACCEPT LATE FILING OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
AND (2) MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
On January 5, 2015, Petitioner-Appellant Barbara Ellen
 
Sherrill (Sherrill) filed (1) a "Motion to Accept Late Filing of
 
Motion for Reconsideration" and (2) a "Motion for
 Reconsideration." Sherrill's Motion for Reconsideration requests
 reconsideration of this Court's Memorandum Opinion, which was
 filed on December 5, 2014.
 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40 
(2000) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) Time. A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a
party only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion,
dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave
additional time is granted during such period by a judge or
justice of the appellate court involved.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 Sherrill did not file her Motion for Reconsideration
 
within ten days after the filing of the Memorandum Opinion as
 
required by HRAP Rule 40. In addition, HRAP Rule 40 only permits
 an extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration through
 special leave granted within ten days after the filing of a
 memorandum opinion. Because Sherrill did not request an
 extension of time to file her Motion for Reconsideration within
 ten days after the filing of the Memorandum Opinion, this court
 had no opportunity to consider whether to grant her additional
 time by special leave during the ten day period. 
Accordingly, pursuant to HRAP Rule 40(a), (1) we deny
 
Sherrill's "Motion to Accept Late Filing of Motion for
 Reconsideration"; and (2) we deny Sherrill's "Motion for
 Reconsideration" as untimely.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 16, 2015.
