IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SYLVA RIVERA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-1327)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sylva Rivera (Rivera) appeals from
 
the Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence filed on September
 
9, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 
Court).1
 
After a jury-waived trial, Rivera was convicted of
 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(b)(3) (Supp. 2011) (OVUII with
 
priors).
 
On appeal, Rivera raises three points of error, 
including that: (1) the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction 
because he is a citizen of the Hawaiian Kingdom; (2) the Circuit 
Court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss for an alleged 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) violation; and (3) there 
was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for OVUII

with priors because (a) there was no substantial evidence that he
 
had operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in an
 
amount "sufficient to impair his normal mental faculties or
 
ability to care for himself and guard against casualty" and (b)
 
there was no evidence that Rivera operated his vehicle on a
 
public way, street, road or highway.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Rivera's points of error as follows: 
(1) As acknowledged by Rivera, in State v.
 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), 
this court held that:
 
the State of Hawai' i has lawful jurisdiction over all
persons operating motor vehicles on public roads or highways
within the State of Hawai' i. Persons claiming to be citizens
of the Kingdom of Hawai' i and not of the State of Hawai' i are 
not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai' i applicable
to all persons (citizens and non-citizens) operating motorvehicles on public roads and highways within the State ofHawai'i. 
Accordingly, we conclude that Rivera's first point of
 
error is without merit.
 
(2) Rivera asserts that the Circuit Court erred when
 
it excluded from the HRPP Rule 48 calculation the entire period
 
between September 27, 2010, when Rivera failed to appear and a
 
bench warrant was issued, and November 15, 2010, the rescheduled
 
trial date. Pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c)(5), "periods that delay
 
the commencement of trial and are caused by the absence or
 
unavailability of the defendant" are excluded. Here, at Rivera's
 
August 23, 2010 arraignment, a jury trial was scheduled for the
 
week of October 4, 2010, and a trial call was set for September
 
27, 2010. Rivera does not deny that he was absent on September
 
27, 2010. As a result, the trial court issued a bench warrant on
 
September 27, 2010. On Wednesday, October 6, 2010, the bench
 
warrant was recalled because, on September 27, 2010, Rivera had
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
mistakenly reported to district court, rather than Circuit Court.
 
The trial was nevertheless reset to November 15, 2010, presumably
 
because it had already been taken off of the trial calendar for
 
the week of October 4th. 
Rivera argues that the only period he was absent or
 
unavailable was the period between September 27, 2010 and October
 
6, 2010. He argues that, because his non-appearance on September
 
27, 2010 was "not willful" and due to miscommunication with the
 
public defender's office, the period from October 6, 2010 to
 
November 15, 2010 should not have been excluded. We disagree. 
HRPP Rule 48(c)(5) excludes periods that are "caused by the
 
absence or unavailability of the defendant" without regard to
 
whether the defendant's failure to appear was intentional or
 
willful. When Rivera failed to appear on September 27, 2010, his
 
absence caused the delay of the commencement of trial.
 
Accordingly, the delay until the trial week of November 15, 2010
 
was properly excluded. Rivera does not argue any other errors in
 
the Circuit Court's Rule 48 calculations and we find none.
 
(3) We reject Rivera's contention, viewing the
 
evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that
 
there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. 
Officer Rivera's testimony provided an ample basis for the trial
 
court's finding that Rivera was impaired, and the officer's
 
testimony, including reasonable inferences therefrom, along with
 
the court's judicial notice, provided substantial evidence that
 
Rivera operated a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or
 
highway. Rivera does not assert any other insufficiency in the
 
evidence supporting his conviction and we find none.
 
Finally, although not raised by Rivera at trial or on 
appeal, the State notes the Hawai' i Supreme Court's decision in 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), in which 
the court held that mens rea must be alleged in an HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) charge; hence, mens rea must be alleged in an HRS § 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
291E-61(b)(3) charge based on conduct described in HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1). The charge against Rivera did not allege a mens rea.
 
In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 53, 276 P.3d at 
622, the supreme court held that the failure to allege a mens rea 
in charging the offense of OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) rendered the charge insufficient. However, the supreme 
court's decision in Nesmith raises, but does not clearly answer, 
the question of whether a deficiency in a charge for failing to 
allege the requisite mens rea is a jurisdictional defect. In 
Nesmith, the concurring and dissenting opinion by Justice Acoba 
reads the majority opinion as concluding "that a state of mind is 
a 'fact' that must be included in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge 
for due process purposes only, but not an element of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) that must be included in a charge for purposes of 
jurisdiction." Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 66, 276 P.3d at 635 
(Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting) (brackets omitted). Although the Nesmith majority opinion does not state this 
distinction between the sufficiency of a charge for due process 
purposes and for jurisdictional purposes in unmistakable terms, 
pending further clarification, we adopt Justice Acoba's reading 
of the majority's opinion. Under this reading, the failure to 
allege a mens rea in the charge of OVUII with priors against 
Rivera would not constitute a jurisdictional defect in the 
charge. We therefore conclude that Rivera waived any challenge 
to the sufficiency of the charge for failure to allege a mens rea 
by not objecting on this basis in the Circuit Court and by not 
asserting this claim on appeal. See State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 
147, 150-51, 785 P.2d 1311, 1313 (1990); State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 584, 827 P.2d 648, 655 (1992) ("Our review of the 
record reveals that [the defendant] did not raise this argument 
at trial, and thus it is deemed to have been waived."); Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) (2008)("Points 
[of error] not presented in accordance with this section will be 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disregarded[.]"); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (2008) ("Points not argued
 
may be deemed waived.").
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's September 9,
 
2011 Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence is affirmed.
