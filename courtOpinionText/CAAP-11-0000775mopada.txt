APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Lynedon Van Ness (Van Ness) appeals 
from the Decision and Order of the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board (LIRAB) filed September 20, 2011, affirming the 
Disability Compensation Division, Department of Labor and 
Industrial Relations' (DLIR) denial of Van Ness's workers' 
compensation claim against Employer-Appellee State of Hawai' i, 
Department of Education (DOE). 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Van Ness was employed by the Department of Education as
 
a technology coordinator at Lahainaluna High School
 (Lahainaluna), on the island of Maui, from July 2005 until
 
November 2006. He maintained and repaired all the technology
 
equipment on campus, and he reported he spent the majority of his
 
time outside, walking to various buildings on campus. Because
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Lahainaluna campus is on the side of a mountain, getting
 
around campus required climbing stairs. Van Ness testified that
 
climbing the stairs from the school's main office up to his
 
office in the library took him about twenty minutes. Many of the
 
buildings were not air-conditioned, and the windows were left
 
open.
 
Before working at Lahainaluna, Van Ness had a pre­
existing asthma condition, which he controlled with medication. 
In late 2005, however, Maui faced days of unusually severe vog1
 
affecting the entire island. Van Ness testified that on the days
 of high vog, he experienced symptoms such as coughing and
 
wheezing, and his over-the-counter medication no longer worked.
 
Consequently, over the winter break Van Ness saw Russell M. Tom,
 
M.D. (Dr. Tom), who had been treating Van Ness since 1991. Dr.
 
Tom diagnosed Van Ness with chronic bronchitis and made note of
 
the vog in his clinical notes dated December 23, 2005 and January
 
28, 2006. Van Ness later saw James M. Sweet, M.D. (Dr. Sweet)
 
and David A. Mathison, M.D. (Dr. Mathison) as well, and all three
 
physicians opined that the vog on Maui worsened Van Ness's
 
symptoms. In March 2006, Dr. Tom wrote a letter recommending
 
that Van Ness transfer to Oahu to avoid further exacerbation, and
 
shortly after Van Ness received approval for a hardship transfer
 
to Oahu.
 
On September 20, 2007, Van Ness filed a claim for
 
workers' compensation benefits, identifying the date of injury as
 
on or about December 23, 2005 and alleging he was exposed to vog
 
while walking around the Lahainaluna campus, exacerbating his
 
asthma and bronchitis. On October 12, 2007, the DOE filed an
 
Employee's Report of Industrial Injury (WC-1) denying liability
 
for the claim. At the DOE's request, Ajit S. Arora, M.D. (Dr.
 
Arora) conducted an independent medical evaluation (IME) of Van
 
Ness on February 5, 2008. Dr. Arora prepared a post-IME report,

as well as a supplemental report prepared after reviewing
 
additional records from the various physicians who had treated
 
Van Ness. On April 21, 2008, the DLIR issued a decision denying
 
Van Ness's claim for compensation, and Van Ness filed an appeal
 
of the DLIR's decision.
 
The LIRAB conducted a hearing on April 6, 2010, and on
 
September 20, 2011 entered its Decision and Order affirming the
 
DLIR's denial of Van Ness's workers' compensation claims. At the
 
hearing before the LIRAB, the parties entered into evidence the
 
reports from Dr. Arora and records from Drs. Tom, Sweet, and
 
Mathison. Van Ness filed a timely notice of appeal to this court
 
on October 24, 2011.
 
On appeal, Van Ness contends the LIRAB erred in denying
 
his workers' compensation claim against the DOE. Specifically,
 
Van Ness challenges the following Finding of Fact (FOF):
 
9. The Board finds that Claimant's work or work
 
environment posed no greater vog exposure than that
posed to the general public. The hazard from vog
exposure Claimant faced while on the campus of
Lahainaluna School was no greater hazard or risk than
that faced by others off of the campus of Lahainaluna
School.
 
Van Ness did not raise FOF 10 as a point of error but 
challenged it in the arguments section of his brief. Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)(C) states "when 
the point [on appeal] involves a finding or conclusion of the 
court or agency, [the points of error shall include] either a 
quotation of the finding or conclusion urged as error or 
reference to appended findings and conclusions[.]" "[I]t is well 
settled that failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) is alone 
sufficient to affirm[.]" Morgan v. Planning Dept. Cnty. of 
Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 173, 180, 86 P.3d 982, 989 (2004). 
Nonetheless, noncompliance does not always result in dismissal, 
and "[t]his is particularly so where the remaining sections of 
the brief provide the necessary information to identify the 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
party's argument." Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 496, 280 
P.3d 88, 94 (2012).
 
Therefore, we review for clear error FOF 10, which
 
states: 
10. The Board has applied the presumption of
compensability and finds that Employer has presented
substantial evidence to overcome said presumption.
 
Van Ness also challenges the following language from
 
the LIRAB's Conclusion of Law:
 
Claimant argues that his asthma was a compensable
disease caused by conditions peculiar to his particular
employment with Lahainaluna School and was in excess
of ordinary hazards or risks faced by the general public.
Claimant also argues that although others in the
community were required to breathe the same air, they
may not have been required to do work that was
comparably strenuous to the work required of him. The
 Board is not persuaded by and does not adopt Claimant's
argument.
 
The Board further concludes that exposure to vog was
not accentuated or made worse by the nature and conditions
of Claimant's employment.
 
Claimant was a technology coordinator. His risk of
 
exposure to vog was walking outdoors and being in some
buildings that were not air-conditioned. These exposures
are no greater than that of the general public. The nature
 and conditions of his employment did not accentuate the
 exposure. Rather, the vog was in the air, and the general
public breathed the same air.
 
Claimant further argues that, but for work, he would
otherwise have been in a filtered environment at his
 home. However, the Board is not persuaded by and does
not accept this argument, since the relevant comparison is
made to the general public's exposure, not Claimant's
alleged comparatively hermetic and sterile home
environment.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"Review of a decision made by a court upon its review
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal. The
 standard of review is one in which [the appellate] court
must determine whether the court under review was right or
wrong in its decision." Lanai Co. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105
 
Hawai'i 296, 306-07, 97 P.3d 372, 382-83 (2004) (quoting 
Soderlund v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 96 Hawai' i 114, 118,
26 P.3d 1214, 1218 (2001)) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).
 
Appellate review of the LIRAB's decision is governed
by HRS § 91-14(g) (1993), which provides that:
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), [conclusions] are reviewable undersubsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regardingprocedural defects are reviewable under subsection (3);[findings] are reviewable under subsection (5); and anagency's exercise of discretion is reviewable under
subsection (6)." Potter v. Hawai� i Newspaper Agency, 89
Hawai'i 411, 422, 974 P.2d 51, 62 (1999) (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted). 
"'[T]he courts may freely review an agency's
conclusions of law.'" Lanai Co., 105 Hawai' i at 307, 97 
P.3d at 383 (quoting Dole Hawaii Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71 Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990)).
The LIRAB's conclusions will be reviewed de novo, under the 
right/wrong standard. Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co., 77 
Hawai'i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 1246, 1249 (1994) (citing State 
v. Furutani, 76 Hawai' i 172, 180, 873 P.2d 51, 59 (1994)). 
"An agency's findings are reviewable under the clearly
erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision was
clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence on the whole record." Poe v. Hawai� i 
Labor Relations Bd., 87 Hawai' i 191, 195, 953 P.2d 569, 573 
(1998) (citing Alvarez v. Liberty House, Inc., 85 Hawai' i 
275, 277, 942 P.2d 539, 541 (1997); HRS § 91-14(g)(5)).
"'An agency's findings are not clearly erroneous and will beupheld if supported by reliable, probative and substantialevidence unless the reviewing court is left with a firm and
definite conviction that a mistake has been made.'" Poe v. 
Hawai�i Labor Relations Bd., 105 Hawai' i 97, 100, 94 P.3d 
652, 655 (2004) (quoting Kilauea Neighborhood Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229-30, 751 P.2d 1031, 1034

III. DISCUSSION
 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-3(a) (Supp. 2011) 
pertains to workers' compensation coverage and states: "If an 
employee suffers personal injury either by accident arising out 
of and in the course of the employment or by disease proximately 
caused by or resulting from the nature of the employment[.]" 
(Emphasis added.) In Flor v. Holguin, 94 Hawai' i 70, 80, 9 P.3d 
382, 392 (2000), recon. in part, 94 Hawai' i 92, 9 P.3d 404 
(2000), the Hawai' i Supreme Court interpreted HRS § 386-3 as 
providing coverage for injuries caused by an "occupational 
disease." The supreme court held that an injury-by-disease is 
compensable under HRS § 386-3 when the disease "(1) is caused by 
conditions that are characteristic of or peculiar to the 
particular trade, occupation, or employment, (2) results from the 
employee's actual exposure to such working conditions, and (3) is 
due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment in 
general[.]" Id. at 81, 9 P.3d at 393 (internal citations 
2
omitted). Pursuant to HRS § 386-85 (1993),  the burden is on the
employer to demonstrate by substantial evidence that these
 
conditions are not present. Id.
 at 79, 9 P.3d at 391. 
In this case, Van Ness claims the exacerbation of his
 
asthma resulted from work-related vog exposure. It is undisputed
 
that Van Ness faced actual exposure to vog in his employment,
 
2
 HRS § 386-85 states:
 
§386-85 Presumptions. In any proceeding for the enforcement of a
claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the
absence of substantial evidence to the contrary:
 
(1) That the claim is for a covered work injury; 
(2) That sufficient notice of such injury has been given; 
(3) That the injury was not caused by the intoxication ofthe injured employee; and 
(4) That the injury was not caused by the wilful intentionof the injured employee to injure oneself or another. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
satisfying the second condition of the Flor test. However, "an
 
ailment does not become an occupational disease simply because it
 
is contracted on the employer's premises[.]" Id. at 80, 9 P.3d
 
at 392 (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude Van
 Ness's condition does not fall within the definition of a
 
compensable occupational disease because the DOE produced
 
substantial evidence that the first and third conditions of Flor
 
were not met.
 
The cases cited in Flor provide further clarification
 
of the definition of an occupational disease, establishing that
 
an occupational disease requires "a recognizable link between the
 
disease and some distinctive feature of the claimant's job,
 
common to all jobs of that sort." Id. at 80, 9 P.3d at 392. An
 
occupational disease cannot be "an ordinary disease of life to
 which general public was equally exposed outside of that
 
employment," and the disease must "have incidence substantially
 
higher in that occupation than in usual occupations or, in case
 
of ordinary disease of life, in general population." Id. at 81,
 
9 P.3d at 393 (citing Booker v. Duke Med. Ctr., 297 N.C. 458,
 475, 256 S.E.2d 189, 196 (1979), Wood v. Harry Harmon Insulation,
 
511 So.2d 690 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987)). In other words, the
 
Flor test requires that "the employer's working conditions
 
produced the ailment as a natural incident of the employee's
 
occupation in such a manner as to attach a hazard distinct from
 
and greater than the hazard attending employment in general." 
Id. at 80-81, 9 P.3d at 392-93. 
Van Ness's occupation was as a technology coordinator,
 
and his primary duties were maintaining and repairing technology
 
equipment. This work, in and of itself, could not have
 
exacerbated his asthma and Van Ness does not contend that it
 
does. Thus, his disease was produced not by "natural incident"
 
or "distinctive feature of the claimant's job, common to all jobs
 
of that sort," Id. at 80, 9 P.3d at 392, but rather by his
 
exposure to vog. Vog exposure itself cannot be considered a
 
condition characteristic of or peculiar to Van Ness's employment,
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
however, because it is undisputed that vog affected the entire
 
island of Maui at the time. As the LIRAB noted in its COL, "the
 
vog was in the air, and the general public breathed the same
 
air."
 
Van Ness contends his work environment and duties made
 
his employment unique and created a higher hazard of vog
 
exposure. The LIRAB specifically addressed this claim in FOF 9,
 
in which it found "[Van Ness's] work or work environment posed no
 
greater vog exposure than that posed to the general public. The
 
hazard from vog [Van Ness] faced while on the campus of
 
Lahainaluna School was no greater hazard or risk than that faced
 
by others off of the campus[.]" We conclude the record contains
 
substantial evidence supporting the LIRAB's finding and rebutting
 
the presumption that Van Ness's injury was work-related. 
The record contains medical reports from several
 
physicians. The reports all concluded the Maui vog exacerbated
 
Van Ness's asthma, but nothing in those reports noted any
 
relationship between the exacerbation and Van Ness's employment. 
One of Van Ness's treating physicians recommended that Van Ness
 
transfer to Oahu to alleviate his condition, not that he transfer
 
to another position or another school on Maui. This
 
recommendation indicates Van Ness's condition was not peculiar to
 
his employment at Lahainaluna but was instead due to his presence
 
on Maui, and in fact his condition improved upon moving to Oahu
 
in November 2006. Lahainaluna's vice principal also stated that
 
she and other employees on campus had experienced ill effects
 
from vog, and she observed that vog pollution was heavier in
 
other parts of the island. Thus, the evidence indicates Van Ness
 
faced a risk no different and no greater than that faced by any
 
member of the general public or in another field of work who
 
spent time outdoors. 
Furthermore, as part of the IME Dr. Arora interviewed
 
Van Ness about his work duties and history, and he noted Van Ness
 
spent about 90% of his time outdoors or in open environments and
 
climbed extensive stairs. However, after reviewing Van Ness's
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
medical records, Dr. Arora submitted a supplemental report in 
which he specifically concluded Van Ness's exacerbated asthma had 
"no relationship to his employment with the [DOE]." Van Ness 
correctly asserts that there is a distinction between the medical 
and legal standards of causation because "[i]n general, existing 
law treats the slightest factor of aggravation as an adequate 
'cause.'" Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 53 Haw. 
406, 410, 495 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1972). Nevertheless, we conclude that Dr. Arora's report, considered together with the other 
evidence in the record, constituted "relevant and credible 
evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a 
conclusion by a reasonable man that an injury or death is not 
work connected." Igawa v. Koa House Restaurant, 97 Hawai' i 402, 
407, 38 P.3d 570, 575 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
In preparing his supplemental report, Dr. Arora
 
examined and summarized extensive medical records dating back
 from 1994. The records indicate Van Ness had a complex medical
 
history and numerous health issues, and Dr. Arora identified a
 
diaphragmatic hernia as a possible cause or contributing factor
 
of Van Ness's exacerbated asthma. The hernia first manifested in
 
October 2004 and became progressively worse, requiring a
 
complicated surgery in May 2006, and Dr. Arora noted that Van
 
Ness's asthma may have been exacerbated by abdominal contents
 
pushing into his chest cavity. Dr. Arora's reports were
 
sufficiently specific and credible to constitute substantial
 
evidence, and given the complexity of Van Ness's medical history,
 
it was reasonable for the LIRAB to conclude Van Ness's condition
 
was unrelated to his work. 
Other than Van Ness's own testimony about his work
 
environment and his duties, there is no other evidence in the
 
record suggesting that vog exposure was a hazard peculiar to his
 
employment or in excess of the hazards of employment in general. 
Considering the substantial evidence previously discussed and in
 
light of the deference due to the LIRAB's role in assessing the
 
credibility and weight of the evidence, Nakamura v. State, 98
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 263, 270, 47 P.3d 730, 737 (2002), we conclude the 
LIRAB's decision was not clearly erroneous. Poe v. Hawai' i Labor 
Relations Bd., 87 Hawai' i 191, 195, 953 P.2d 569, 573 (1998) 
(mixed questions of fact and law reviewed under clearly erroneous 
standard).
