Defendants-Appellants Lambert K. Kaohelaulii and Brenda
 
L.V. Kaohelaulii ("Kaohelauliis") appeal from the September 27,
 
2011 Judgment for Possession1
 entered by the District Court of
the Second Circuit ("District Court").2 The District Court held
 
that Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company

 Referring to the document as "the judgment," the Kaohelauliis
designated the September 27, 2011 Order 1) Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession Filed May 12, 2011 and 2) DenyingDefendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Verified Complaint for EjectmentFiled July 1, 2011 as the document appealed from. However, Hawai' i appellate
courts have generally held that "a mistake in designating the judgment . . .should not result in the loss of the appeal as long as the intention to appealfrom a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the
appellee is not misled by the mistake." State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai' i 513,
516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quotingCity & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Midkiff, 57 Haw. 273, 275-76, 554 P.2d 233, 235

Trust 2007-1 Mortgage Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series
 
2007-1 was entitled to possession of real property located 22
 Kealohilani Street in Kahului ("Subject Property") and entered a
 Writ of Possession on September 27, 2011. 
On appeal, the Kaohelauliis contend that Deutsche
 
Bank's complaint should have been dismissed for want of subject
 matter jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 604­5(d) (Supp. 2011) and District Court Rules of Civil Procedure
 ("DCRCP") Rule 12.1. The Kaohelauliis also contend that the
 District Court erred in granting the Plaintiff's motion for
 summary judgment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 conclude that the Kaohelauliis' appeal is without merit.
 
The Kaohelauliis contend that the District Court lacked
 
subject matter jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5(d) and DCRCP Rule
 12.1 because the action concerns a title dispute.
 
Under HRS 604-5(d), the District Court lacks subject 
matter jurisdiction over matters of title to real estate. Under DCRCP Rule 12.1, defendants may raise a title dispute as a defense. DCRCP Rule 12.1 sets out requirements to prevent abuse of this defense. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 
Hawai'i 32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 1132 (2011). 
The Kaohelauliis declaration and attached exhibits
 
failed to satisfy the DCRCP Rule 12.1 requirements for raising an
 issue of title. Rule 12.1 requires a defendant to provide an
 affidavit stating the "source, nature, and extent of the title
 claimed by defendant" and "further particulars as shall fully
 apprise the court of the nature of defendant's claim." Dist. Ct.
 R. Civ. P. 12.1. (2012). The purpose of the affidavit is to provide the court with information to discern the interest claimed by the defendant. Peelua, 126 Hawai' i at 37, 265 P.3d at 
1133. Bare assertions are insufficient to sustain a claim that title is at issue so as to divest the District Court of jurisdiction. Id. at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134.

Here, the Kaohelauliis' declaration failed to provide 
any particulars about the source, nature, or extent of their 
title, saying only that they "believed [they] owned title to the Subject Property . . . ." The Kaohelauliis failed to state that they held, or even ever had, title to the Subject Property. Instead, in essence, the Kaohelauliis tried to impeach their own title to the Subject Property in an attempt to prove that they could not have validly mortgaged the property in the first place. See Uy v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Civ. No. 10-00204 ACK-RLP, 2011 WL 1235590, at *5 n.16 (D. Haw. Mar. 28, 2011) (rejecting a practically identical argument that, under "Hawai' i Kingdom law," 
plaintiff's own claim to title was deficient). The Kaohelauliis' declaration is insufficient; therefore, they failed to show that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. See, 
e.g., Kauai Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Pia, No. CAAP-11-0000823, 2013 WL 135423 (Haw. App. Jan. 7, 2013) (SDO); Peelua, 126 Hawai'i at 37–38, 265 P.3d at 1133–34. 
In addition to their argument concerning subject matter 
jurisdiction, the Kaohelauliis impeach their own claim to title in order to impair Deutsche Bank's quitclaim deed and thereby argue that Deutsche Bank did not present an adequate claim to title to warrant the District Court's grant of summary judgment. This argument is without merit. See Uy, 2011 WL 1235590, at *5 
n.16.; cf. State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i 479, ___, 291 P.3d 377, 
385 (2013). 
Therefore, the September 27, 2011 Judgment for
 
Possession is affirmed.
