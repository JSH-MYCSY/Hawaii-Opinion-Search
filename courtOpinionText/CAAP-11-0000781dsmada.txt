(Appellant Ellis) November 30, 2011 motion to remand for lack of

judgment, (2) Defendant-Appellant P.F. Three Partners' 
December 1, 2011 joinder in Appellant Ellis's November 30, 2011 motion to remand for lack of appellate jurisdiction with directions to vacate partial final judgment, (3) Plaintiff/ Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee BG Incorporated's December 2, 2011 memorandum in opposition to Appellant Ellis's November 30, 2011 motion to remand for lack of appellate jurisdiction with directions to vacate partial final judgment, and (4) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over the Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto's July 19, 2011 partial final judgment and December 21, 2011 final judgment, because neither the July 19, 2011 partial final judgment nor the December 21, 2011 final judgment satisfies the specificity requirements for an appealable final judgment in a case with multiple claims under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2010) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76

Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
 
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added).
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCPRule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to case upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
A judgment that does not specifically identify the claim or
 
claims on which it enters judgment requires an appellate court to
 search the often voluminous record on appeal in order to
 determine the specific claim or claims on which the circuit court
 intends to enter judgment. As the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
explained, "we should not make such searches necessary by
 allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of
 HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be
 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face,
 either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." 
Id. (emphasis added). 
Although multiple parties in this consolidated case
 
have filed multiple complaints with multiple claims, multiple
 counterclaims with multiple claims, and multiple cross-claims
 with multiple claims, the July 19, 2011 partial final judgment
 and December 21, 2011 final judgment purport to enter judgment
 "on the title claims in this [a]ction" without specifically
 identifying the count or counts in the multiple complaints,
 multiple counterclaims and/or multiple cross-claims on which the
 circuit court intends to enter judgment. Therefore, neither the
 July 19, 2011 partial final judgment nor the December 21, 2011
 final judgment satisfies the specificity requirements for an
 appealable judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
 Jenkins.
 
Absent the entry of an appealable judgment, this appeal
 
is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate
 court case number CAAP-11-0000781.
 
Jurisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction[,] . . . shall not require anything other than
a dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction,
a court is not in a position to consider the case further.
 
Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 64, 69 
n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Ellis's
 
November 30, 2011 motion to remand for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction with directions to vacate partial final judgment is
 denied.
