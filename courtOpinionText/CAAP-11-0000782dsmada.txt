THEODORICO ERUM, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. RC-11-1-0077)
 
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT THEODORICO ERUM, JR.'S,
MARCH 5, 2012 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Theodorico Erum,
 
Jr.'s (Erum), March 5, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11­
0000782 for lack of jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
by Plaintiff-Appellee Kauai Credit Adjusters Limited (KCAL) in
 
opposition to Erum’s March 5, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No.
 CAAP-11-0000782 for lack of jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it
 appears that Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (Supp.
 2011) does not authorize jurisdiction over this appeal from
 district court civil number 5RC11-1-0077, the Honorable Edmund
 Acoba presiding, because the district court has not yet entered a
 final judgment or final order that adjudicates Count 2 and Count
 3 in KCAL’s complaint.
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from a district
 
court's final judgment or final order that resolves all claims:
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted) (emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994) is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.

The September 6, 2011 judgment adjudicated only Count 1
 
of KCAL’s complaint. KCAL purported to unilaterally and
 
voluntarily dismiss Count 2 and Count 3 of its complaint pursuant
 to KCAL’s October 6, 2011 notice of voluntary dismissal of Count
 2 and Count 3 of KCAL’s complaint pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(i) of
 the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP). However,
 DCRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(i) provided a very limited time period during
 which KCAL could unilaterally and voluntarily dismiss its own
 claims without an order of the district court:
 
Rule 41. Dismissal of actions.
 
(a) Voluntary dismissal: Effect thereof.
 
(1) BY PLAINTIFF; BY STIPULATION. An action may be
dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by
filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the return
date as provided in Rule 12(a) or service by the adverse
party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment[.]
 
DCRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(i) (emphasis added). Despite the reference
 
in DCRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(i) to "service by the adverse party of an
 answer[,]" DCRCP Rule 12(a) does not absolutely require a
 defendant to "serve" a written "answer" on the plaintiff, but,
 instead, DCRCP Rule 12(a) allows the defendant the alternative of
 physically appearing in court on the return date and orally
 answering the plaintiff's complaint. See DCRCP Rule 12(a) ("All
 
defendants shall appear or answer at the time appointed in the
 summons, on the second Monday following the date or service,
 except where the district judge sets some other secular day; and
 should such Monday be a legal holiday then upon the next secular
 day."). The district court minutes indicate that on February 28,
 2011, Erum physically appeared at the return hearing for KCAL’s
 complaint, and Erum orally answered KCAL’s complaint by denying
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
liability. It appears that the time period under DCRCP Rule
 
41(a)(1)(i) for KCAL to unilaterally and voluntarily dismiss
 Count 2 and Count 3 expired when Erum appeared at the February 28,
 2011 return hearing and orally answered KCAL’s complaint, and,
 thus, KCAL’s October 6, 2011 DCRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(i) notice of
 voluntary dismissal of Count 2 and Count 3 was and is invalid. 
Consequently, the district court has not yet entered the
 appealable final judgment or final order in this case that will
 end the litigation by fully deciding the remaining rights and
 liabilities of all parties and leave nothing further to be
 adjudicated. Absent an appealable final judgment or final order,
 Erum’s appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 
Under Hawai' i case law, when an appellate court 
determines that it lacks jurisdiction, the only appropriate remedy is dismissal of the appellate case: 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original  action.
 Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack jurisdiction
shall not require anything other than a dismissal of the appeal or
action. Without jurisdiction, a court is not in a position to
consider the case further. Thus, appellate courts have an
obligation to insure that they have jurisdiction to hear and
determine each case. The lack of subject matter jurisdiction can
never be waived by any party at any time. Accordingly, when we
perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua
sponte, dismiss that appeal.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Erum’s March 5, 2012 motion
 
to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000782 for lack of jurisdiction is
 
granted, and Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000782 is dismissed for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction without prejudice to Erum’s initiating a
 new appellate court case by asserting a timely appeal from the
 district court's future judgment or order that is appealable.
