STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SONNY ATTAGUILE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2DTC-11-000602)
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sonny Attaguile (Attaguile) appeals
 
from the Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, entered on
 
September 30, 2011 in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 
Wailuku Division (District Court).1
 
Attaguile was found guilty of Driving Without a
 
License, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 286-102
 
(2007 and Supp. 2012) and No Motor Vehicle Insurance, in
 
violation of HRS ยง 431:10C-104(a) (2005 and Supp. 2012).
 
On appeal, Attaguile contends there was insufficient
 
evidence to support his convictions because the State did not
 
adduce substantial evidence to establish that Attaguile was the

same person stopped and cited on January 4, 2011 for Driving
 
Without a License and No Motor Vehicle insurance. Attaguile also
 
claims that the State failed to adduce substantial evidence to
 
negate Attaguile's defense, pursuant to HRS ยง 431:10C-117(a)(4)
 
(2005 and Supp. 2012), that he was an operator of a borrowed
 
motor vehicle and had a reasonable belief that the subject
 
vehicle was insured. Lastly, Attaguile argues that the State
 
failed to adduce substantial evidence that he acted with the
 
requisite state of mind in order to convict him of No Motor
 
Vehicle Insurance.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Attaguile's points of error as follows:
 
(1) When the evidence adduced at trial is considered
 
in the strongest light for the prosecution, there was substantial
 
evidence that Attaguile was the person cited by Officer Travis
 
Abarra (Officer Abarra) on January 4, 2011 for Driving Without a
 
License and No Motor Vehicle Insurance. Officer Abarra 
identified Attaguile at trial as the driver of a vehicle he
 
stopped and issued citations to on January 4, 2011. Moreover,
 
the last four digits of Attaguile's social security number and
 
his date of birth matched information that was provided to
 
Officer Abarra by the driver of the vehicle stopped on January 4,
 
2011. "The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established
 
beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State
 
v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). 
(2) The State was not required to adduce substantial
 
evidence to negate a defense that Attaguile had a reasonable
 
belief that the vehicle he was driving was insured. The State
 
had no obligation to negate such a defense until some evidence

was presented that Attaguile was an "operator of a borrowed motor 
vehicle" and that he held a reasonable belief that the subject 
vehicle was insured. State v. Bolosan, 78 Hawai' i 86, 89, 890 
P.2d 673, 676 (1995). See also, State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 
139-40, 976 P.2d 444, 453-54 (1999) (prosecution need not 
disprove self insurance unless some evidence of that defense has 
been introduced). 
At trial, Attaguile did state that he was not aware
 
whether the subject vehicle, which he claimed belonged to his
 
brother, was insured. However, Attaguile denied that he was
 
driving the subject vehicle, denied that he was the person who
 
was stopped by Officer Abarra, denied that he ever drove the
 
subject vehicle, and stated that he was at home at the time of
 
the incident. Attaguile did not produce any evidence that he was
 
an "operator of a borrowed vehicle" because he denied operating a
 
vehicle on that day and denied that he ever drove the subject
 
vehicle. Therefore, the State was not required to negate the
 
defense under HRS ยง 431:10C-117(a)(4).
 
(3) The State adduced substantial evidence that
 
Attaguile acted with the requisite state of mind to convict him
 
of No Motor Vehicle Insurance. 
Attaguile failed to produce an
 
insurance card and admitted that he did not have no-fault
 insurance on January 4, 2011. This evidence alone was sufficient
 
to establish that Attaguile and the vehicle were uninsured. Id.
 
at 135, 976 P.2d at 449.
 
Given the difficulty of proving the requisite state of
mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, "we have
consistently held that . . . proof by circumstantial
evidence and reasonable inferences arising from
circumstances surrounding the [defendant's conduct] is
sufficient. . . . Thus, the mind of an alleged
offender may be read from his acts, conduct and
inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances."
 
Id. at 140, 976 P.2d at 454 (citation and some brackets omitted). 
In the absence of any evidence implicating the "good faith
 
borrower" defense, the District Court could reasonably have
 
inferred from the fact that Attaguile drove the vehicle without

insurance that he did so either intentionally, knowingly, or
 
recklessly. Id.
