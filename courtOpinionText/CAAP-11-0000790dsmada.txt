KURT BUTLER, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MDDR HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., et al., Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0102(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Kurt Butler's (Appellant 
Butler) appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000790 from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's October 21, 2011 judgment, because the October 21, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. "[A]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify
the claims for which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims
not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be
 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face,
 either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the
 finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." 
Id. (emphasis added).
 
Although Appellant Butler asserted multiple causes of
 
action against multiple defendants through Appellant Butler's
 February 10, 2009 complaint and August 28, 2009 first amended
 complaint, the October 21, 2011 judgment merely dismisses
 Appellant Butler's claims against only one defendant, Defendant-
Appellee MDDR Health Solution, Inc. The October 21, 2011
 judgment neither resolves Appellant Butler's claims against the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
other remaining defendants in this case nor contains an express 
finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the October 21, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment in a multiple-party/multiple-party case under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. 
We note that the October 21, 2011 judgment contains the
 
following statement that declares that the circuit court resolved
 the other claims against the other remaining defendants through
 prior orders:
 
WHEREAS, Plaintiff's claims against the other
Defendants identified in Plaintiff's First Amended
 
Complaint have been determined by way of dismissal
or by the entry of default judgment.
 
October 21, 2011 Judgment at 2. Nevertheless, this statement
 
does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment
 under Jenkins because this statement does not contain operative
 language that actually disposes of the other claims against the
 other remaining defendants. Instead, the statement merely
 describes what previous orders effectuated in the past. One
 cannot confirm whether the previous orders actually disposed of
 the other claims unless one searches through the volumes of the
 record on appeal, finds the previous orders, and reads the
 previous orders in detail. In order to be appealable, however, a
 final judgment must, on its face, contain all the operative
 language necessary to dispose of each and every claim in the
 case, so that a search of the record on appeal is unnecessary for
 the purpose of confirming that the circuit court resolved all
 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims against all parties. One of the primary purposes of the 
holding in Jenkins is to prevent an appellate court and its staff from having to search the often voluminous circuit court record to confirm that the circuit court resolved each and every claim: 
If we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to case upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Thus, for example,
 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 120 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1339 n.4 (emphases added).
 
The October 21, 2011 judgment does not contain, on its
 
face, sufficient operative language to resolve Appellant Butler's
 
claims against the other remaining defendants in this case. The
 October 21, 2011 judgment does not contain an express finding of
 no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on the subset
 of claims that the October 21, 2011 judgment resolves pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the October 21, 2011 judgment does
 not satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment in a
 multiple-party/multiple-party case under HRCP Rule 58 and the
 holding in Jenkins. Absent the entry of an appealable final
 judgment, the appeal is premature, and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000790. 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in
 
Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000790 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
