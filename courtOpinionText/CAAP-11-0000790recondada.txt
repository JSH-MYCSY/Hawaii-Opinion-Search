OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
KURT BUTLER, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
CLINTON MYERS, JASON KEEFNER, MDDR HEALTH
SOLUTIONS, INC., ALPHA EXECUTIVE
SECURITY, Defendants-Appellees
 
ORDER DENYING FEBRUARY 27, 2012 HRAP RULE 40
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF FEBRUARY 24, 2012
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the February 24, 2012 order
 
dismissing Appeal CAAP-11-0000790 for lack of jurisdiction, (2)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Kurt Butler's (Butler) February 27, 2012
 
motion to reconsider the February 24, 2012 dismissal order
 
pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure, 
and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook or
 misapprehend any points of law or fact when we dismissed Appeal
 
No. CAAP-11-0000790 for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
Jurisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction[,] . . . shall not require anything other than
a dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction,
a court is not in a position to consider the case further.
 
Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 64, 69 
n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994) (emphases added). We note, 
however, that upon dismissal of this appeal Butler may make a request to the Second Circuit Court that the court enter an
 
appealable judgment.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Butler's February 27, 2012
 
HRAP Rule 40 motion to reconsider the February 24, 2012 dismissal
 order is denied.
