STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 11-1-0003(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Rodney I. Fukumoto (Fukumoto)
 
appeals from the "Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law, Order
 
Dismissing Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Rule 40 HRPP) To
 
Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment Or To Release Petitioner
 
from Custody and Order" entered October 6, 2011 in the Circuit
 
1
Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court).
Fukumoto is an inmate serving a sentence of life
 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole for attempted murder
 in the second degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) 705-500 (1993) and 707-701.5 (1993). 
Fukumoto previously
 
served a term of five years imprisonment for a charge of
 unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle (UCPV), a class C

felony in violation of HRS ยง 708-836 (1993). The maximum term of
 
the sentence imposed in his UCPV case has expired.
 
Fukumoto contends the circuit court erred when it
 
denied him relief on his claims the Hawaii Paroling Authority
 
(HPA) improperly set minimum terms of imprisonment for attempted
 
murder and UCPV. The minimum terms set by the HPA in both cases
 
have expired. Fukumoto served his maximum term of imprisonment
 
in the UCPV case, was released on parole in his attempted murder
 
case, violated that parole, and had his parole revoked.
 
Fukumoto is now serving the remainder of his maximum
 
term of life imprisonment in the attempted murder case. This
 
term is not based on the minimum term set by the HPA, but is
 
based on the HPA's setting of his recommitment term after his
 
revocation pursuant to HRS ยง 706-670(8).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Fukumoto's appeal is without merit.
 
Because the minimum terms set for both of Fukumoto's
 
sentences had expired, the circuit court correctly held that the
 
issues raised by Fukumoto were in fact moot.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has ruled that 
[t]he duty of this court, as of every other judicial
tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgmentwhich can be carried into effect, and not to give opinionsupon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declareprinciples or rules of law which cannot affect the matter inissue in the case before it. 
Courts will not consume time deciding abstract propositions of law
or moot cases, and have no jurisdiction to do so. 
Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, 312, 141 P.3d 480, 485 
(2006) (quoting Wong v. Bd. of Regents. Univ. of Hawai' i, 62 Haw. 
391, 394-395, 616 P.2d 201, 204 (1980)). 
Additionally, the circuit court ruled that no hearing
 
was required to address Fukumoto's claims of ineffective
 
assistance of counsel. The circuit court found "the assistance

provided by [Fukumoto's] attorney, when 'viewed as a whole,' was 
'within the range of competence demanded' of an attorney in this 
type of criminal case." See Dan v. State, 76 Hawai' i 423, 427, 
879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (citations omitted). The circuit court went on to point out that even if Fukumoto's allegations were 
taken as true, they would not entitle him to a post-conviction 
hearing. See State v. Allen, 7 Haw. App 89, 92, 744 P.2d, 789, 
792 (1987). The court found Fukumoto failed to show "that such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense," and 
noted Fukumoto's "request for a new minimum term hearing is moot. 
There is no benefit that could be gained by such a hearing, nor 
does any effective remedy exist." 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Facts,
 
Conclusions of Law, Order Dismissing Petition for Post-Conviction
 Relief (Rule 40 HRPP) To Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment Or
 
To Release Petitioner from Custody and Order" entered October 6,
 
2011 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
