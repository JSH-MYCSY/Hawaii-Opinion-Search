IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DAVID M. SCHLESINGER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KONA DIVISION
 
(CR. NO. 3DTC-11-0498096)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard)
 
Defendant-Appellant David M. Schlesinger (Schlesinger)
 
appeals pro se from the Order and Notice of Entry of Order
 
entered on September 30, 2011, in the District Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit (District Court).  After a hearing on Schlesinger's
 
motion to dismiss and a bench trial, Schlesinger was convicted of
 
Driving a Motor Vehicle Without a Driver's License, in violation
 
of HRS ยง 286-102 (2007).
 
Schlesinger raises two points of error on appeal,
 
contending that: 
(1) when denying Schlesinger's motion to
 
dismiss, the District Court "never addresse[d] the essential
 elements raised in [Schlesinger's] motion to dismiss"; and (2)
 
the District Court violated Schlesinger's due process rights when
 
it proceeded to trial without first giving Schlesinger a chance

 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo presided.

to review the court's written order denying his motion to dismiss.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Schlesinger's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Schlesinger provides no authority or cogent
 
argument supporting his contention that the District Court's oral
 
ruling and/or written order denying Schlesinger's motion was
 
legally insufficient and we find none. 
(2) No transcript was provided for the hearing on
 
Schlesinger's motion to dismiss and subsequent trial. "The law
 
is clear in this jurisdiction that the appellant has the burden
 
of furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record to
 
positively show the alleged error." Union Bldg. Materials Corp.
 
v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984); see also State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai' i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 
(2000). Schlesinger provides an insufficient record to review the court's communication of its ruling on the motion to dismiss, 
to discern whether Schlesinger objected to proceeding with the 
bench trial, or to review whether further elucidation of the 
court's ruling might have aided Schlesinger in his defense to the 
charge of driving without a license. Indeed, Schlesinger 
provides no authority or cogent argument supporting his 
contention that the District Court deprived him of due process 
when it failed to allow him to review the court's written order 
denying his motion to dismiss, prior to the trial on his driving 
without a licence charge. We find none.
