NO. CAAP-11-0000801
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
AWI MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellee v.
JANIS COWSER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC-11-1-500)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Janis Cowser (Cowser) appeals pro
 
se from the February 3, 2012 Judgment for Possession and Writ of
 
Possession, entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit
 
1
(District Court),  in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee AWI Management
Corp. and against Cowser.
 
Cowser's opening brief fails to even minimally comply 
with the requirements of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28, including failure to identify any points of error on 
appeal, and fails to provide any discernible argument in favor of 
vacating or reversing the District Court's Judgment for 
Possession and Writ of Possession. Upon careful review of the 
parties' submissions and the record of the District Court 
proceedings, we conclude that Cowser's appeal is without merit.
