        FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Casugay-Badiang (Casugay-Badiang) was charged with two counts of
 
Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1240.8 (Supp. 2011).2
 
On July 26, 2011, Casugay-Badiang pled guilty to both
 
counts. The applicable penalty for each count was an
 
indeterminate term of ten years of imprisonment, a mandatory
 
minimum term of one to four years of imprisonment, and up to a
 
$10,000,000 fine.
 
Sentencing was held on October 5, 2011. Defense
 
counsel stated that he understood the sentences for Casugay­
Badiang's offenses were mandatory, but asked the circuit court to
 
exercise its discretion with respect to the mandatory minimum
 
terms of imprisonment, and sentence Casugay-Badiang to one-year

 HRS § 712-1240.8 provides:
 
§712-1240.8 Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree. 
(1) A person commits the offense of methamphetamine trafficking in the
 
second degree if the person knowingly distributes methamphetamine
in any amount.
 
(2) Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree is a class B
felony for which the defendant shall be sentenced as provided in
subsection (3).
 
(3) Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640, 706-641, 706-660,
706-669, and any other law to the contrary, a person convicted of
methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree shall be sentenced to
an indeterminate term of imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory
minimum term of imprisonment of not less than one year and not greater
than four years and a fine not to exceed $10,000,000; provided that:
 
(a) 	If the person has one prior conviction for methamphetamine
trafficking pursuant to this section or section 712-1240.7,
the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment shall be not less
than three years, four months and not greater than six
years, eight months;
 
(b) 	If the person has two prior convictions for methamphetamine
trafficking pursuant to this section or section 712-1240.7,
the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment shall be not less
than six years, eight months and not greater than ten years;
 o r
 
(c) 	If the person has three or more prior convictions for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or
section 712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment shall be ten years.

     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. The State concurred
 
with Casugay-Badiang's position that one-year mandatory minimum
 
terms of imprisonment were appropriate, inasmuch as Casugay-
Badiang had "a clean record, no other arrests[,]" and admitted to
 
selling methamphetamine because he had a drug problem. Rather
 
than sentencing Casugay-Badiang to a mandatory one-year
 
imprisonment and maximum ten years of imprisonment pursuant to
 
HRS § 712-1240.8, the circuit court sentenced Casugay-Badiang as
 
a young adult offender to a maximum term of imprisonment of five
 
years pursuant to HRS § 706-667 (Supp. 2011).3 The court stated:
 
Okay. Um, sometimes, Counsel, the court asks you to
indulge the court whether you want to or not. Just by way
of editorializing here, you, I look at this PSI, this young
man was all of 19 years old when he committed these offenses
and he only 20 now. He just turned 20 several months ago. 
3
 HRS § 706-667 provides:
 
§706-667 Young adult defendants.  (1) Defined. A young adult
defendant is a person convicted of a crime who, at the time of the
offense, is less than twenty-two years of age and who has not been
previously convicted of a felony as an adult or adjudicated as a
juvenile for an offense that would have constituted a felony had the
young adult defendant been an adult.
 
(2) Specialized correctional treatment. A young adult defendant
who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding thirty days may be
committed by the court to the custody of the department of public safety
and shall receive, as far as practicable, such special and
individualized correctional and rehabilitative treatment as may be
appropriate to the young adult defendant's needs.
 
(3) Special term. A young adult defendant convicted of a felony,
in lieu of any other sentence of imprisonment authorized by this
chapter, may be sentenced to a special indeterminate term of
imprisonment if the court is of the opinion that such special term is
adequate for the young adult defendant's correction and rehabilitation
and will not jeopardize the protection of the public. When ordering a
special indeterminate term of imprisonment, the court shall impose the
maximum length of imprisonment, which shall be eight years for a class A
felony, five years for a class B felony, and four years for a class C
felony. The minimum length of imprisonment shall be set by the Hawaii
paroling authority in accordance with section 706-669. During this
special indeterminate term, the young adult shall be incarcerated
separately from career criminals, when practicable.
 
This section shall not apply to the offenses of murder or
attempted murder.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
He has absolutely no record. He has no juvie record. He
 
has no adult record. Now he's young, but he has no record,
no arrests, nothing, except for this.
 
And I understand why the legislature did what they did
in 2006. They're a political body, and, you know, there's
no question that ice was really and still is a scourge on
this community. And there were TV reports and lots of media
and, you, so they reacted like politicians do.
 
And I'm not faulting them. But you know, I look at
this PSI and I look at this young man and then I look at the
fact that they took away all discretion from the court, you
know, and they mandated an open ten and a mandatory minimum
and a fine and all of this.
 
And again I say I understand it, but I don't think
it's right. Uh, I think that's what the courts are for. I
 think that's why we should have some discretion, more
discretion than they gave us here.
 
I want to note that the statute at issue here,
712-1240.8 in the sentencing section which is Sub 3 it says
this, the plain language, it says "Notwithstanding Sections
706-620, 706-640, 706-641, 706-660, and 706-669."
Notwithstanding those specific sections. And then it does
 throw in this, "And any other law to the contrary, a person
convicted shall be sentenced to the open ten," et cetera, et
cetera. But they specifically mention these one, two,
three, four, five subsections of the sentencing Chapter 706.
 
And if you go back and look as I have, it's the
probation section, et cetera, et cetera. All right.
Because normally a sentence like this -- and until they pass
it, 712-124[0].8 would have been probationable. But they
specifically say "notwithstanding those sections" in effect
taking away the court's discretion. I would note, however,
that one section which is not mentioned specifically as one
of those five sections is 706-667. They don’t say
notwithstanding 706-667.
 
Now they do, like I say, throw in that "and any other
law to the contrary," but in my view, which are well-settled
principles of statutory construction, when they mention five
particular subsections in Chapter 706 and don't mention one,
706-667, I take that as then still keeping 706-667 in play.
 
I'm going to sentence Mr. Casugay-Badiang pursuant to
706-667. I'm going to find that he was less than 22 years
of age at the time of the offense[s]. That's undisputed.
I'm going to find that he's not been previously convicted of
a felony as an adult or adjudicated as a juvenile for an
offense that would have constituted a felony. I'm going to
find that a special term under 706-667 is adequate for this
young adult defendant's correction and rehabilitation and
will not jeopardize the protection of the public.
 
The long and short of it is I'm going to sentence him
as a young adult defendant in this case. And I suppose if
the prosecutors feel[] strongly enough about this, they'll
writ me and then we'll see. Okay. If [t]he supreme court
 
4
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
says I can't do it, fine. Obviously I will bow to my
superiors on the supreme court. But until they do, that’s
my, uh, that's my analysis of these sections and their
interplay.
 
So Mr. Casugay-Badiang is going to be committed to the
custody of the Director of the Department of Public Safety
for an open five as a young adult defendant, concurrent,
mandatory minimum one year. I have no discretion there I
 don't believe. He has to pay a fine -- that's mandatory—up
to ten million dollars. The fine's going to be one dollar.
He is going to provide buccal swab samples and print
impressions of each hand and, if required by the collecting
agency's rules or internal regulations, blood specimens
required for law enforcement identification analysis.
 
He will pay a monetary assessment of $500 or the
actual cost of DNA analysis, whichever is less, to the DNA
Registry Special Fund. Uh, he will pay a Crime Victim
Compensation Fee of $205, a Drug Demand Reduction Assessment
fee of $205. He will get credit for time served. The mitt
will be forthwith.
 
On October 6, 2011, the State filed its "Motion to
 
Correct Illegal Sentence." The State maintained that Casugay­
Badiang’s sentence under HRS § 706-667 was contrary to
 
HRS § 712-1240.8(3), and asked that the circuit court correct the
 
illegal sentence imposed upon Casugay-Badiang.
 
On October 17, 2011, the circuit court denied the
 
State's motion and on November 3, 2011, the State filed a timely
 
notice of appeal.
 
II.
 
On appeal, the State contends the circuit court abused
 
its discretion in sentencing Casugay-Badiang to five years
 
imprisonment under HRS § 706-667 as a young adult defendant as
 
opposed to sentencing him under HRS § 712-1240.8(3).
 
III.
 
HRS § 712-1240.8(3) provides:
 
(3) Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640,
706-641, 706-660, 706-669 and any other law to the contrary,
a person convicted of methamphetamine trafficking in the
second degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of
imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment of not less than one-year and not greater than
four years and a fine not to exceed $l0,000,000[.]
 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 712-1240.8 clearly precludes the
 
applicability of sentencing as a young adult defendant under
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 706-667 for cases involving methamphetamine trafficking in
 
the second degree because HRS § 706-667 is contrary to 
HRS § 712-1240.8. The legislature intended to divest the circuit
 
court of its discretion to sentence Casugay-Badiang under any
 
sentencing statute other than HRS § 712-1240.8(3). State v.
 
Dannenberg, 74 Haw. 75, 80-81, 837 P.2d 776, 778-79 (1992) (the
 language "notwithstanding any law to the contrary" in the
 
prostitution statute "clearly [limited] the discretion of the
 
trial court in sentencing prostitution offenses and to provide a
 
mandatory sentencing structure unlike that for other petty
 
misdemeanors."). In the instant case, the circuit court
 
acknowledged that the plain language of HRS § 712-1240.8(3)
 
appeared to impose limits on its discretion. The circuit court
 
stated:
 
I look at the fact that they took away all discretion from
the court, you know, and they mandated an open ten and a
mandatory minimum and a fine and all of this. 
And again I say I understand it, but I don't think it's
right. Uh, I think that's what the courts are for. I think 
that's why we should have some discretion, more discretion than
they gave us here."
 
The circuit court erred in disregarding the plain 
language of HRS § 712-1240.8(3) and sentencing Casugay-Badiang as 
a young adult offender pursuant to HRS § 706-667. State v. 
Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 127, 144, 890 P.2d, 1167, 1184 (1995). The 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that, when 
interpreting a statute, an appellate court's 
foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.
And where the language of the statute is plain and
unambiguous, [a court's] only duty is to give effect to [the
statute's] plain and obvious meaning.

(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in original

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The legislative history of HRS § 712-1240.8 is not
 
inconsistent with the statute's plain language. 
In 2004, the legislature stated that it enacted
 
HRS § 712-1240.6 (the predecessor to HRS § 712-1240.8) "to
 
address the devastating effects of crystal methamphetamine
 
(commonly known as ice) abuse in Hawaii[,]" and to "[i]ncrease
 
mandatory minimum sentences and impose large penalties for
 
methamphetamine trafficking[.]" H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 495-04,
 
in 2004 House Journal, at 1603. The legislature amended the
 
offenses of promoting dangerous drugs in the first, second, and
 
third degrees by "eliminat[ing] the manufacturing and
 
distribution of methamphetamine elements which are incorporated
 
in the new offense of methamphetamine trafficking. The mandatory
 
minimum sentences for methamphetamine trafficking are deleted
 
because of the creation of the new offense[.]" Id. The
 
legislature stated that its intent was to "[s]pecify that other
 
statutes relating to sentencing do not apply to the offense of
 methamphetamine trafficking[.]" Id. at 1604 (emphasis added).
 
The legislature expressed this intent by providing in
 
HRS § 712-1240.6(4) (Supp. 2005) that "[a] defendant convicted of
 
the offense of unlawful methamphetamine trafficking shall be
 
sentenced in accordance with this section, notwithstanding
 
sections 706-620(2), 706-659, 706-640, and 706-641."
 
In 2006, the legislature made it even clearer that no
 
other sentencing statutes applied to the offenses of
 
methamphetamine trafficking in the first and second degrees. The
 
legislature provided language in HRS § 712-1240.7(3) (Supp. 2011)
 
and HRS § 712-1240.8(3) that "[n]otwithstinding sections . . .
 
and any other law to the contrary, a person convicted of
 
methamphetamine trafficking in the [first and second degrees]
 
shall be sentenced to . . .." (emphasis added); see 2006 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 230, § 4 at 998-99.

IV.
 
Therefore, the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
entered October 5, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
is vacated, and this case is remanded to the circuit court for
 
sentencing pursuant to HRS § 712-1240.8.
