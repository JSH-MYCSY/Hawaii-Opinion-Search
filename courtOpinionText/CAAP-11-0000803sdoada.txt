TY D. BOYDSTUN, Claimant-Appellant, v.
POLYNESIAN CULTURAL CENTER, Employer-Appellee,
and
 
SEABRIGHT INSURANCE COMPANY, Insurance Carrier-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2008-528 (2-07-01585))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
On July 28, 2006, while working as a security guard for
 
the Polynesian Cultural Center ("Employer"), Claimant-Appellant
 
Ty D. Boydstun ("Boydstun") stepped and tripped on uneven ground. 
He experienced low back pain following the incident. On January
 30, 2007, Employer filed a "WC-1 Employer's Report of Industrial
 Injury" stating that Boydstun injured his back using a grass
 blower on January 27, 2007. The actual date of the event when
 Boydstun injured his back continues to be in dispute. Employer
 did not deny liability for the work injury, but challenges the
 extent of the alleged injury.
 
On May 12, 2008, Boydstun filed a "Form WC-5,
 
Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits". He
 described his injury as "[two] bulging discs in lower back
 causing severe pain [and] indiscriminate collapse of left leg." 
He noted the date of the accident as July 2006, and stated that
 the disability start date was January 27, 2007. As his reason
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
for filing, he wrote: "My doctor submitted a treatment form
 
(program) that has been virtually ignored, aside from a few
 
physical therapy treatments. Original treatment program was
 submitted [approximately] 1 year ago." 
Boydstun appeals from the October 12, 2011 Decision and
 
Order ("Decision and Order") of the Labor and Industrial
 Relations Appeals Board ("Board" or "LIRAB"), which affirmed in
 part, modified in part, and reversed in part the October 24, 2008
 Decision of the director of the Disability Compensation Division
 ("Director"), in which the Director concluded, among other
 things, that "the claimant is not entitled to further treatment
 as claimant's injury of 1/27/2007 resolved by 6/20/2007." 
Boydstun appears to challenge the majority of the
 
findings of fact ("FOF") contained in the Board's Decision and
 Order.
1 However, some of his challenges involve elaborations or
 
clarifications of the Board's findings rather than actual
 challenges.
2 He also appears to challenge the Board's
 
conclusions of law ("COL"). 
Boydstun appears to contend that (1) any identification
 
of January 27, 2007 as the date of his injury is clearly
 erroneous (FOF 2, 3, 5, 12, 18, 20, and 24–27; COL 1); (2) many
 of the other background findings articulated by the Board are
 clearly erroneous (FOF 6, 8, 13–19, and 20); (3) the Board erred
 in concluding that Employer is not liable for further temporary
 total disability ("TTD") after February 26, 2007 (FOF 21-27; COL
 2); (4) the Board's conclusion that Boydstun's lower back
 condition amounts to only 5% permanent partial disability ("PPD")
 is based on erroneous findings of fact (FOF 28 and 29; COL 3);
 
1
 Boydstun's opening brief fails to comply in many respects with the
requirements of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b).
Failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) is alone sufficient to affirm the
Board's Decision and Order. See Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104
Hawai'i 173, 180, 86 P.3d 982, 989 (2004) (citing Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. 
United Agri. Prods., 86 Hawai' i 214, 235, 948 P.2d 1055, 1076 (1997)).
However, taking into consideration that Boydstun is pro se, we note that it is
the policy of this court "to permit litigants to appeal and to have their
cases heard on the merits, where possible." O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu,
77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994). Thus, we address Boydstun's
arguments on the merits to the extent that they are discernible. 
2
 It does not appear that Boydstun is challenging FOF 1, 4, 7, 9,
10, or 11.

and (5) he is entitled to attorneys' fees.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Decision and Order and resolve Boydstun's appeal as
 follows:
 
(1) Boydstun contends that the Board mis-identified
 
the date of his work injury as January 27, 2007. Assuming for
 the sake of argument that the Board's identification of January
 27, 2007 as the injury date was erroneous, Boydstun does not
 explain and we are unable to discern how the date affected the
 Board's ultimate decision regarding Byodstun's entitlement to
 medical benefits or its other conclusions of law. Therefore, any
 alleged error is harmless.
3 See, e.g., Kahawaiolaa v. United
 
Airlines, Inc., 2012 WL 54497, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2012)
 ("Regardless of whether LIRAB's FOFs 14 and 15 are clearly
 erroneous, any error was harmless."); Kawamoto v. NHC, Inc., 2009
 WL 3350309, at *5 (Haw. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2009) (stating that a
 challenged LIRAB finding played no "meaningful role" in LIRAB's
 determination regarding claimant's injury and thus any potential
 error was harmless).
 
(2) The Board's findings that provide background for
 
its Decision and Order and support for its conclusion that
 Boydstun was entitled to compensation for medical care, services,
 and supplies as the nature of his work injury requires are
 consistent with the various MRI results, physician medical
 reports, letters releasing Boydstun to work full duty, the WC-5
 form, and testimony of the parties. Therefore, they are not
 clearly erroneous.
 
We specifically affirm the Board's findings crediting 
Dr. Leonard N. Cupo's opinion, because the record contains substantial evidence supporting his opinion. In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai
'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000) 
3
 In his challenge to FOF 5, Boydstun contends that he was not able
to recover certain documents from Employer in connection with the preparation
of his case. In light of our decision here, inasmuch as Boydstun indicates
that these documents would relate to the identification of the date of the
 injury, we need not further address the issue.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(substantial evidence is "credible evidence which is of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion" (quoting Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai
'i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1120, 1125 
(1999)). Dr. Cupo's report described in detail his review of all Boydstun's available medical records, including the reports by Dr. Christopher Brace, the MRI and other tests that were conducted, as well as records from Boydstun's more recent visits to mainland physicians. Under the circumstances, Dr. Cupo's report constituted substantial evidence upon which the Board could rely in making its ultimate conclusion regarding Boydstun's condition and compensation. Therefore, we affirm FOF 19 and 20. 
(3) With respect to the payment of TTD, the Board
 
concluded that "Employer is not liable for further TTD after
 February 26, 2007 and through June 4, 2010." Accordingly, it
 appears that the Board affirmed the TTD payments from February 2,
 2007 through February 26, 2007, and thus we review the Decision
 and Order as to its denial of TTD payments from February 26, 2007
 through the medical reports submission deadline of June 4, 2010. 
First, we address the "gap periods", for which there
 
are no disability certifications apparent in the record. The
 Board found at FOF 24 that "[t]he record contains no
 contemporaneous medical certification of total disability from
 work . . . from February 27, 2007 to February 19, 2008, from
 April 1, 2008 to April 3, 2008, and after May 15, 2008 through
 June 4, 2010, the medical reports deadline." Based on the
 chronology reflected in Dr. Brace's Work Status reports 
4 and Dr.
 
Cupo's independent medical examination ("IME"), we agree that
 there were no available certifications supporting a TTD award
 from February 27, 2007 through February 19, 2008 because the two
 Work Status Reports completed during that period, and Dr. Brace's
 December 19, 2007 letter, do not indicate that Boydstun was
 unable to work.
 
The two other "gap periods" indicated by the Board are
 
not as clearly delineated. Even taking ambiguities in the record
 
4
 This chain of events is reflected in the Board's FOF 25 and 26,
and Boydstun's challenge to that finding is therefore without merit. 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
into account, however, it appears that the Board did not err in
 
finding that the record contained no contemporaneous medical
 certifications of total disability for April 1, 2008 to April 3,
 2008 and from May 15, 2008 through June 4, 2010. 
HRS § 386-96 governs the reports of physicians and
 
requires that one rendering "service to an injured employee shall
 make a report of the injury and treatment on forms prescribed by
 and to be obtained from the [Department of Labor and Industrial
 Relations]," and that "[i]nterim reports . . . shall be made at
 appropriate intervals to verify the claimant's current diagnosis
 and prognosis[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 386-96(a)(2) (Supp. 2013). 
The statute further requires that the reports contain "the dates
 of disability, any work restrictions, and the return to work
 date." Id. Similarly, Hawaii Administrative Rules ("HAR") § 12­
15-80(a)(3)(E) provides that "[i]nterim WC-2 reports shall be
 submitted monthly . . . to the employer" and include "[d]ates of
 disability, work restrictions, if any, and return to work date."
 Haw. Admin. R. § 12-15-80(a)(3)(E) (2004). 
Because of these requirements, it was reasonable for 
the Board to credit the return to work dates provided in Dr. Brace's reports, rather than any generalizations about reevaluation or further treatment, in determining specific dates for which TTD compensation is appropriate. While "[c]laimants should not be denied benefits under Hawai
'i workers' compensation 
law simply because their physician failed to properly enter the requisite report in the prescribed manner[,]" the Board "needs sufficient evidence to render a TTD decision." Custino v. State, 
Dep't of Transp., 2014 WL 2007953, at *5 (Haw. Ct. App. May 15, 2014). Accordingly, there was insufficient evidence supporting TTD benefits for the "gap periods" identified by the Board, and we affirm the Board's determination at FOF 24 that there were no contemporaneous medical certifications for those periods. 
Second, we address the Board's conclusions regarding
 
the sufficiency of the certifications that were submitted,
 specifically for the dates of February 20, 2008 to March 31,
 2008, and April 4, 2008 to May 14, 2008. 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Although the Board found that there were medical
 
certifications from Dr. Brace in the record for the periods of
 
February 20, 2008 to March 31, 2008 and April 4, 2008 to May 14,
 2008, the Board did not credit those certifications. With
 respect to the February 20, 2008 disability certificate, the
 
5
Board noted that it did not identify the date of injury,  that
Boydstun had been released to work for almost a year and had confirmed at trial that his back was fine, and that Dr. Brace's diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy as the reason underlying the disability had been ruled out by MRI and EMG testing. On appeal, we defer to the Board's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and weight of the evidence, Moi v. State, Dep't of Public Safety, 118 Hawai
'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753 756 (App. 
2008), and Boydstun has not provided adequate support for his argument that the Board erred in its credibility determination about Dr. Brace's February 20, 2008 recommendation. 
As to the disability certification from April 4, 2008

 
to May 14, 2008, the Board noted that this off-duty certification
 was "despite [Boydstun's] report that his left leg pain resolved
 by April 4, 2008." Again, we defer to the Board's assessment of
 the credibility of Dr. Brace's recommendation as compared to
 Boydstun's report of his condition, and uphold the Board's
 discrediting of Dr. Brace's off-duty recommendation. As such, we
 affirm the Board's determinations as to the validity of the
 disability certifications for February 20, 2008 to March 31, 2008
 and April 4, 2008 to May 14, 2008.
6
 
In sum, the Board properly determined that (1) from
 
February 27, 2007 to February 19, 2008, there were no
 certifications, (2) the certification from February 20, 2008
 
5
 With respect to the lack of an injury date, Boydstun argues that
"[i]t is possible that Dr. Brace overlooked or just assumed all parties were
on board with the date of injury." Here, however, it appears that the Board
discredited Dr. Brace's certification for a number of reasons in addition to
 the lack of a specified injury date. 
6
 In contesting the Board's findings on this issue, Boydstun asserts
that his current physicians have prescribed surgery, therapy and medication to
treat his ongoing condition. However, the Board did not foreclose any
particular treatment option. It simply noted that Boydstun had not submitted
any treatment plans that it could consider, and it found that the
certifications had not been submitted as required in order to justify an award
of TTD benefits.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
through March 31, 2008 was discredited, (3) from April 1, 2008 to
 
April 3, 2008 there was no certification, (4) the certification
 from April 4, 2008 to May 14, 2008 was discredited; and (5) there
 were no valid certifications from May 15, 2008 onward.
 
(4) At FOF 29, the Board credited Dr. Cupo's
 
impairment rating of 5% permanent partial impairment of the whole
 person for Boydstun's lumbar spine and, at COL 3, deemed Boydstun
 entitled to that level of PPD compensation for his low back
 
7
condition. In contesting this conclusion,  Boydstun alleges that
"Dr. Cupo's prediction of 5% does not come close to my loss in
 mobility." 
Dr. Cupo's determination of a 5% whole-person 
impairment attributable to the lumbosacral spine work injury was based on "medical records available for review" up through September 1, 2009, and the American Medical Association Guide, Fifth Edition. 
HAR § 12-10-21(a) provides that "[i]mpairment 
rating guides issued by the American Medical Association . . . may be used as a reference or guide in measuring a disability." H
AW. ADMIN. R. § 12-10-21(a) (1981); see also Cabatbat v. Cnty. of 
Hawai'i, Dep't of Water Supply, 103 Hawai 'i 1, 6, 78 P.3d 756, 761 
(2003) (confirming that HAR § 12-10-21 permits reliance on the American Medical Association guides, although their use is not mandated to the exclusion of other guides). 
Although Boydstun disputes the validity of Dr. Cupo's
 
8
conclusion,  and the Board's reliance on that conclusion, we
reiterate that appellate courts 
7
This section also addresses Boydstun's challenge to FOF 28.
 
8
 In his Opening Brief, Boydstun specifically challenges FOF 28 on
the grounds that "[a]s of September 2009, my current physicians, some of the
best Spine Doctors and Surgeons in North America, arguably the world, have
prescribed surgery, therapy and medication for the remainder of my life." He
 also requests a functionality exam to determine his loss of mobility
"conducted by a physician of [his] doctor's choice with relevant
compensation." 
With respect to these contentions, we note that Dr. Cupo's IME
specifically credited the examination of Boydstun's lumbosacral spine by
orthopedist Dr. Charles Banta on September 1, 2009. Dr. Cupo noted that the
"[e]xamination by Dr. Banta on 9/1/09 revealed muscle spasm of the lower
lumbar spine and left hip. There was no motor or sensory deficit, reflex
asymmetry, or positive sciatic nerve tension signs of the lower extremities."
Thus, in making his determination, Dr. Cupo in fact referenced a recent
examination by a mainland physician of Boydstun's choice.

decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain
whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings,
or to review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon
the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony,
especially the findings of an expert agency dealing with a
specialized field. 
Nakamura, 98 Hawai 'i at 268, 47 P.3d at 735 (quoting Igawa v. Koa 
Pancake House Rest., 97 Hawai 'i 402, 409-410, 38 P.3d 570, 577-78 
(2001)). As noted before, the Board did not err in crediting Dr. 
Cupo's IME, and therefore we decline to second-guess the agency's crediting of Dr. Cupo's 5% impairment rating and affirm the Board's FOF 29 and COL 3. 
(5) Boydstun requests that "[a]ny related attorney
 
fees [be] covered in full." Inasmuch as Boydstun fails to
 suggest a basis for an award of attorneys' fees and we can find
 none, his request is without merit.
 
Therefore,

 
The Board's October 12, 2011 Decision and Order is
 
affirmed.
