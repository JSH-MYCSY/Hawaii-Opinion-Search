IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
MICHELLE PECK, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
ALAN KUIPER, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DOMESTIC ABUSE NO. 11-1-0489)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Michelle Peck (Peck) appeals from
 
the Order Dissolving Temporary Restraining Order for Protection,
 
entered on October 5, 2011 in the Family Court of the Second
 
Circuit (Family Court).1
 
On October 5, 2011, the Family Court dissolved a
 
temporary restraining order for protection against Respondent-
Appellee Alan Kuiper (Kuiper) that was issued on September 20,
 
2011.
 
On appeal, Peck contends the Family Court erred by
 
concluding that a protective order was not necessary to prevent
 
any acts or threatened acts of domestic abuse.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Peck's point of error as follows:

A temporary restraining order granted pursuant to
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 586 shall remain in effect
 
at the discretion of the family court. HRS ยง 586-5 (2006 and
 
Supp. 2012).
 
With respect to the issuance of a TRO, a relief in equity,
the relief granted by a court in equity is discretionary and
will not be overturned on review unless the court abused its
 discretion. . . . A court abuses its discretion whenever it
 exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party.
 
In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawaif i 211, 223, 151 P.3d 
692, 704 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets,
 
and ellipses in original omitted).
 
The Family Court did not abuse its discretion by
 
dissolving the temporary restraining order against Kuiper. HRS
 
ยง 586-5.5 (2006) states:
 
ยง 586-5.5 Protective order; additional orders. (a) If,
after hearing all relevant evidence, the court finds that
the respondent has failed to show cause why the order should
not be continued and that a protective order is necessary to
prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse, the court
may order that a protective order be issued for a further
fixed reasonable period as the court deems appropriate.
 
The Family Court stated that there may have been an
 
incident of domestic abuse, but that it did not feel that a
 
protective order was necessary to prevent further domestic abuse. 
Apparently, the Family Court believed that the domestic abuse
 
incident relied on by Peck occurred when Peck accused Kuiper of
 
serious misconduct and Peck asserted that Kuiper responded by
 
pushing and shoving her. The Family Court did not find that
 
Kuiper's nudging Peck with a car as she walked behind the
 
reversing vehicle constituted a prior incident of domestic abuse
 
as alleged by Peck in her petition. Due to the lack of a finding
 
of a prior history of domestic abuse and a finding that Kuiper's
 
apparent abuse of Peck was an isolated incident that occurred
 
after the accusations by Peck, this court cannot say the Family
 
Court abused its discretion by finding insufficient evidence to

support a conclusion that a protective order was necessary to
 
prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse.
 
THEREFORE,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Dissolving
 
Temporary Restraining Order for Protection, entered on October 5, 
2011 in the Family Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
