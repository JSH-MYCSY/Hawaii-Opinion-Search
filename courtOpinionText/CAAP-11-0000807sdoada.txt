NO. CAAP-11-0000807
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ILONA K. MILLER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-1934)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ilona K. Miller (Miller) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence, entered
 
on October 5, 2011 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1
 
Miller was convicted of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in
 
the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 712-1243 (Supp. 2012).
 
On appeal, Miller claims (1) plain error where the
 
deputy prosecuting attorney (DPA) made remarks during closing
 
argument and on rebuttal that constituted prosecutorial
 
misconduct and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support her
 
conviction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Miller's points of error as follows:
 
(1) When the DPA's initial comments are viewed in
 
context, his comments to the jury during closing argument related
 
to the law with respect to possession of any dangerous drug "in
 
any amount." When taken in context, the comments concerned the
 
possibility of jury nullification with respect to the quantity of
 
drugs necessary under the law, in light of the evidence
 
establishing that the baggie possessed by Miller contained only
 
0.012 grams of methamphetamine. Miller's argument that the DPA
 
admonished the jury that they had a duty to convict Miller is not
 
supported by the record when the comments are viewed in their
 
proper context.
 
In State v. Hatori, 92 Hawai' i 217, 220, 990 P.2d 115, 
118 (App. 1999), a defendant contended that a jury nullification 
instruction should have been given and objected on appeal to a 
prosecutor's comment in summation that "after being selected as a 
juror in this case, all of you swore that you would follow the 
law." This court stated: 
On balance we are persuaded by the position adhered to
by most jurisdictions. Therefore, we conclude that
Defendant had no substantial right to an instruction
informing the jury of jury nullification or to the
deletion of an instruction informing the jurors that
they were to follow the law as given them by the
court. It follows that the prosecutor's comments did
not infringe on any of Defendant's substantive rights.
We conclude that plain error was not committed by the
court.
 
Id. at 224, 990 P.2d at 122; see also United States v. Perez, 86
 
F.3d 735 (7th Cir. 1996) (jury nullification is not a right of
 
the jury or the defendant).
 
Thus, the DPA's initial comments were not inappropriate
 
when viewed in their proper context. As to the DPA's rebuttal
 
comments, the challenged comments were made after the DPA had,
 
inter alia, discussed the evidence, stated the jury's
 
consideration was to match the evidence to the statute, and had
 
discussed the evidence in light of the reasonable doubt standard.

Given these circumstances, the DPA's remarks in rebuttal were not
 
improper.
 
(2) Contrary to Miller's claim, there was sufficient
 
evidence to convict her of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the
 
Third Degree.
 
HRS § 712-1243(1) states:
 
§712-1243 Promoting a dangerous drug in the third
degree. (1) A person commits the offense of promoting
a dangerous drug in the third degree if the person
knowingly possesses any dangerous drug in any amount.
 
"'Dangerous drugs' means any substance or immediate
 
precursor defined or specified as a 'Schedule I substance' or a
 
'Schedule II substance' by chapter 329, or a substance specified
 
in section 329-18(c)(13), except marijuana or marijuana
 
concentrate." HRS § 712-1240 (Supp. 2011). Methamphetamine is
 
listed in Schedule II under HRS § 329-16(e)(2) (2010).
 
When the evidence adduced at trial is viewed in the 
strongest light for the prosecution, there was substantial 
evidence to support Miller's conviction on the grounds that she 
possessed methamphetamine found in the pocket of her shorts. 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). Officer Gaynor Minton (Officer Minton) testified that she searched Miller's shorts and emptied Miller's pockets. Among 
the items that were pulled out of Miller's pocket, and which fell 
to the ground, was a baggie containing a crystalized substance. 
Officer Minton testified that Miller then responded "Please, 
please, it's rubbish[,]" with a demeanor that was "sort of 
begging for me to possibly throw it away or ignore it." Testing 
of the substance inside the baggie showed it to be 
methamphetamine. 
[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state of
mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, "[w]e have
consistently held that . . . proof by circumstantial
evidence and reasonable inferences arising from
circumstances surrounding the [defendant's conduct] is
sufficient. . . . Thus, the mind of an alleged offender may
be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn
from all the circumstances."

State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) 
(quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai' i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 
(1997)). It could reasonably be inferred that Miller knowingly 
possessed methamphetamine stored in a baggie when she told 
Officer Minton in a begging tone, "Please, please, it's rubbish," 
in an attempt to have Officer Minton disregard it. 
Miller argues that the State's witness, who recovered 
the baggie containing methamphetamine from Miller, was not 
credible. However, credibility is for the trier of fact to 
determine. State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 
693, 697 (1999). 
THEREFORE,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment Of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence, entered on October 5, 2011 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
