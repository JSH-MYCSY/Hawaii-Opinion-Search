STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
PETER T. HOSHINO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1P111-1588)
 
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 26, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Peter T.
 
Hoshino's (Appellant Hoshino) April 26, 2012 motion to dismiss
 
Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000810 for lack of jurisdiction,
 (2)
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's lack of response
 
thereto, and (3) the record, it appears that the Honorable Paula
 Devens's October 12, 2011 judgment of conviction against
 Appellant Hoshino for negligent failure to control a dangerous
 dog in violation of Revised Ordinances of Honolulu § 7-7.2 (2011)
 does not contain the complete sentence that the district court
 intended to impose.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12 (Supp. 2011)
 
provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from
 
all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all
 criminal matters." Under similar circumstances where a district
 court judgment provided part, but not all, of the district
 court's intended sentence, we held that the judgment was not
 final and appealable:
 
Judgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence. In the
 instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay restitution. The court did
 not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount. Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from
the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005). In the instant case, the record indicates that, although 
the district court's October 12, 2011 judgment imposed part of the sentence against Appellant Hoshino, the district court did not include the intended restitution portion of the sentence in the October 12, 2011 judgment. Therefore, it appears that the October 12, 2011 judgment is not a final judgment, as HRS § 641­12 requires. Absent an appealable final judgment in the record on appeal, we cannot exercise appellate jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000810. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Hoshino's April 26,
 
2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-11-0000810 for lack of
 jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-11­0000810 is dismissed without prejudice to Appellant Hoshino

 Appellant Hoshino must pay as a part of his sentence.
