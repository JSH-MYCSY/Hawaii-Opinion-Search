CHARLES P. POUONO, Claimant-Appellee/Appellant, v. DAIICHIYA­
LOVES BAKERY, INC., and TRAVELERS PROPERTY CASUALTY COMPANY OF
AMERICA, Employer/Insurance Carrier-Appellant/Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-076 (2-08-00965))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal, Claimant-Appellee/Appellant
 
Charles P. Pouono (Pouono) appeals from the Labor and Industrial
 
Relations Appeals Board's (Board) October 17, 2011 Decision and
 
Order (Decision and Order) reversing the Director of the
 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations' Decision sustaining
 
Pouono's claim for workers' compensation benefits from Employer­
Appellant/Appellee Daiichiya-Loves Bakery, Inc. (Daiichiya-
Loves), and Insurance Carrier-Appellant/Appellee Travelers
 
Property Casualty Company of America.1
 
The Board ruled in Daiichiya-Loves's favor on the
 
following issues as defined by the Board:
 
(1) Whether [Pouono] sustained a personal injury to the
left hip on December 10, 2007, arising out of and in the
course of employment; and if so,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Whether [Pouono] is entitled to and [Daiichiya-Loves is]
liable for [Pouono's] total hip replacement surgery.
 
On appeal, Pouono essentially argues that the Board
 
failed to properly apply the presumption of compensability set
 
2
forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-85 (1993)  and that
the Board erroneously concluded that Daiichiya-Loves presented
 
substantial evidence to rebut the presumption.
 
After reviewing the record on appeal, the points

 
raised, the parties' arguments and the applicable legal
 
authority, we affirm.
 
We begin with the presumption that Pouono's claim for 
hip replacement surgery due to a hip injury is a covered work 
injury and then examine the record to determine whether 
Daiichiya-Loves was able to meet its heavy burden of providing 
substantial evidence to overcome the presumption. Van Ness v. 
State of Hawai 'i, 131 Hawai 'i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014). 
The Board clearly acknowledged that it was required to
 
apply the presumption of compensability, and thus, there is no
 question that the Board was aware of the correct legal standard. 
The issue on appeal is whether the Board properly applied the
 
presumption. 
Daiichiya-Loves "bore the initial burden of providing 
substantial evidence to rebut the presumption" that Pouono's work 
activities contributed to the collapse of his femoral head, which 
in turn led to the hip replacement surgery. Nakamura v. State, 
98 Hawai
'i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002). If Pouono's 
employment activity at work caused "the slightest aggravation or 
acceleration" of his injury, he was entitled to compensation. 
Van Ness, 131 Hawai 'i at 562, 319 P.3d at 481 (citation and 
2
 HRS § 386-85 provides, in relevant part:
 
§386-85 Presumptions. In any proceeding for the
enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter
it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence
to the contrary:
 
(1) That the claim is for a covered work injury[.]

Four out of the five doctors rendering opinions in this
 
case agreed that Pouono had developed avascular necrosis as a
 
result of a February 2007 motor vehicle accident (MVA). As the
 
Board found,
 
[a]vascular necrosis is progressive bone death caused by a
disruption in blood supply. Bone that is dying becomes weak
and loses its ability to support weight. Avascular necrosis
 in the hip could develop over time and may lead to collapse
of the femoral head.
 
14. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a
 
common sequelae of left acetabular fracture and dislocation
of the hip. [Pouono's] serious fracture and dislocation of
the left hip in the February 2007 MVA caused sufficient
trauma to blood vessels in the hip and likely interrupted
the blood supply to the femoral head.
 
The issue for the physicians was whether avascular necrosis could
 
be aggravated or accelerated by weight-bearing activities, such
 
as those performed by Pouono at work. Drs. Lau and Scoggin, who
 
conducted independent medical examinations and an independent
 
medical records review respectively, answered in the negative.
 
The Board concluded that Pouono's left femoral head 
collapse was not work-connected and therefore his total hip 
replacement surgery was not a compensable consequence. "[A] 
conclusion of law will not be overturned if supported by the 
trial court's findings of fact and by the application of the 
correct rule of law." Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 
Hawai'i 86, 93, 34 P.3d 16, 23 (2001). 
The Board's finding of non-compensability is consistent
 
with Van Ness because the Board credited the medical testimony
 that Pouono's work activities did not even slightly aggravate or
 
accelerate his pre-existing underlying condition of avascular
 
necrosis that led to his left femoral head collapse. The medical
 
opinions of orthopedic surgeons Drs. Lau and Scoggin supported
 
Daiichiya-Loves's position that Pouono's avascular necrosis was
 
not work-related. Drs. Lau and Scoggin each individually
 
prepared detailed reports that explained avascular necrosis,
 
concluded that Pouono's avascular necrosis could not be
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
aggravated or accelerated by weight-bearing activities at work,
 
and explained their reasoning for rejecting Pouono's contention
 
that alleged work-related activities caused him to aggravate his
 
condition and precipitated his need to undergo hip replacement
 
surgery at an earlier date. 
We conclude that the medical opinions of Drs. Lau and 
Scoggin concerning the cause of Pouono's femoral head collapse 
provided a sufficient degree of specificity to rebut the 
presumption of compensability and was more than a mere 
"generalized medical opinion" about Pouono's pre-existing 
condition. See Nakamura, 98 Hawai 'i at 268-69, 47 P.3d at 735­
36. The primary focus of the medical testimony was a specific
 
discussion on whether Pouono's employment effort, whether great
 
or little, in any way aggravated his avascular necrosis which
 
resulted in his femoral head collapse. 
Given the foregoing evidence, we conclude that 
Daiichiya-Loves presented substantial evidence that, as accepted 
by the trier of fact, was sufficient to rebut the presumption of 
compensability and to show that Pouono's avascular necrosis was 
not caused, aggravated, or accelerated by his work activities. 
These medical opinions constitute "a high quantum of evidence[,]" 
which was "relevant and credible evidence of a quality and 
quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable 
[person] that [Pouono's hip] injury . . . [wa]s not work 
connected." Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai 'i 402, 407, 38 
P.3d 570, 575 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
[H]aving concluded that [Daiichiya-Loves] adduced
substantial evidence which, if true, could rebut the
presumption of compensability, we review the Board's
decision in light of our deference to its role in assessing
the relative credibility and weight of the evidence for and
against compensability, mindful that [Daiichiya-Loves] bears
the burden of persuasion as to which [Pouono] should be
given the benefit of the doubt.
 
Nakamura, 98 Hawai 'i at 270, 47 P.3d at 737. 
When reviewing the Board's decision on the issue of
 
compensability, we must give deference to the Board's
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determinations regarding the witness credibility and evidentiary 
weight, and we conclude that the Board did not err in ruling that 
Pouono's hip injury was not compensable. Panoke v. Reef Dev., 
113 Hawai 'i 449, 329 P.3d 354, No. CAAP-11-0000556 2014 WL 
2949410 at *2 (App. June 30, 2014) (SDO) (citing Moi v. State, 
Dep't of Pub. Safety, 118 Hawai 'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 756 
(App. 2008)); Nakamura, 98 Hawai 'i at 268, 47 P.3d at 735; and 
Igawa, 97 Hawai 'i at 409-10, 38 P.3d at 577-78. The Board 
explicitly found that it believed Drs. Lau and Scoggin. It did not accept as credible the opinions of Drs. Uhr, Murray, and 
Nadamoto that work aggravated Pouono's condition and gave its 
rationale for discounting these opinions. 
The conflicting medical evidence regarding the cause of 
injury was not of equal weight and effect, and therefore, the 
Board did not err in reconciling the evidence presented in favor 
of Daiichiya-Loves. See Nakamura, 98 Hawai
'i at 270, 47 P.3d at 
737 (interpreting Chung v. Animal Clinic, Inc., 63 Haw. 642, 636 P.2d 721, (1981), to stand for the proposition that credible 
conflicting testimony should be resolved in favor of the claimant 
when the conflicting evidence regarding causation is of "equal 
weight and effect"). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the October 17, 2011
 
Decision and Order entered by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board.
