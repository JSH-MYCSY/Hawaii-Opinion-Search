On November 3, 2011, the family court entered Judgment 
against Kanaka' ole sentencing her to 35 hours of community 
service. On November 9, 2011, Kanaka' ole filed a notice of 
appeal. 
On appeal, Kanaka' ole contends the family court lacked 
jurisdiction because she is a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai' i. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude 
Kanaka'ole's appeal is without merit. See Adams v. State, 103 
Hawai'i 214, 222, 81 P.3d 394, 402 (2003); see also State v. 
Ferqerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 3, 2011
 
"Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" of the Family Court of the
 Third Circuit is affirmed.
