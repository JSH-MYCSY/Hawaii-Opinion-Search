IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHONG HUNG HAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 10-1-1098)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Chong Hung Han (Han) appeals from
 
the Family Court of the First Circuit's (Family Court's) Amended
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment), filed on October
 13, 2011.
1 After a jury trial, Han was convicted of Abuse of
 
Family or Household Member, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 709-906 (Supp. 2010), and sentenced to a two-day
 
term of imprisonment, domestic violence intervention, and payment
 
of various fees.
 
Han raises one point of error on appeal, contending 
that the Family Court violated Han's constitutional right to 
testify because it failed to properly advise Han of his right to 
testify, in accordance with Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 
900 P.2d 1293 (1995), and ensure that Han's waiver of his right to testify was voluntary and knowing.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Han's point of error as follows:
 
Tachibana requires that, "in order to protect the right 
to testify under the Hawai' i Constitution, trial courts must 
advise criminal defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in 
which the defendant does not testify." Id. at 236, 900 P.2d at 
1303 (footnote omitted). Where a defendant's waiver of his or her constitutional right to testify appears in the record, the 
issue on appeal is whether the defendant's waiver was sufficient 
to constitute a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his 
or her right to testify. See State v. Merino, 81 Hawai' i 198, 
220, 915 P.2d 672, 694 (1996). 
In this case, as instructed by the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court in Tachibana, the Family Court informed Han of his right to testify or not testify before trial commenced and conducted a 
brief colloquy with Han before the defense rested at trial, to 
ensure that Han's decision not to testify was his own. See 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 237 & n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304 & n.9. Han 
does not argue that the Family Court's initial advisement was 
constitutionally infirm. Han argues, however, that the Family 
Court's end-of-trial colloquy was inadequate because it was 
conducted with the assistance of an interpreter, it was 
relatively brief, and Han's responses to the court were simply 
"yes" or "no." We disagree. 
Han does not argue, and there is nothing in the record
 
to indicate, that the interpreter had any problem interpreting
 
the Family Court's colloquy or that Han did not understand the
 
colloquy because it was being interpreted. Han clearly
 
indicated, through his answers to the court's questions, that he
 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily decided not to testify.
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the
 
record in this case demonstrates that Han's waiver of his
 
constitutional right to testify was done knowingly,
 
intelligently, and voluntarily. 
Accordingly, we affirm the Family Court's October 13,
 
2011 Judgment.
