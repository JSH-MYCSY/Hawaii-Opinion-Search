 The Honorable Edmund D. Acoba presided .
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal Pia contends the district court erred in
 
denying Pia's motion for reconsideration because the district
 
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS)ยง 604-5(d) (Supp. 2011) and District Court Rules of
 
Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Pia's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Pia contends the district court lacked subject matter
 
jurisdiction under HRS ยง 604-5(d) and DCRCP Rule 12.1 inasmuch as
 
the action concerns a title dispute.
 
Under HRS ยง 604-5(d) the district court lacks subject 
matter jurisdiction over matters of title to real estate. Under 
DCRCP Rule 12.1, defendants may raise a title dispute as a 
defense. DCRCP Rule 12.1 sets out requirements to prevent abuse 
of this defense. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., v. Peelua, 126 
Hawai'i 32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 1132 (2011). 
Pia's affidavit and attached exhibits failed to satisfy 
the DCRCP Rule 12.1 requirements for raising an issue of title. Rule 12.1 requires a defendant to provide an affidavit stating 
the "source, nature, and extent of the title claimed by 
defendant" and "further particulars as shall fully apprise the 
court of the nature of the defendant's claim." DCRCP Rule 12.1. 
The purpose of the affidavit is to provide the court with 
information to discern the interest claimed by the defendant. 
Peelua, 126 Hawai' i at 37, 265 P.3d at 1133. Bare assertions are 
insufficient to sustain a claim that title is at issue so as to divest the district court of jurisdiction. Id. at 38, 265 P.3d 
at 1134. Pia's affidavit did not describe the source, nature, or the extent of title claimed by Pia.

Furthermore, even if Pia's assertions had merit, they
 
were not made in a timely manner. They were not made until after
 
judgment was entered.
 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated
motion. Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding.
 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 
Ltd., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) (quoting 
Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai' i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 
(2000)). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the (1) August 3, 2011 Writ
 
of Possession, (2) August 3, 2011 Judgment for Possession, (3)
 October 17, 2011 "Order Denying Defendant Jacob M. Pia's Motion
 
for Reconsideration or New Trial Filed on August 12, 2011" (4)
 
October 17, 2011 Writ of Possession, and (5) October 17, 2011
 
Judgment for Possession all entered in the District Court of the
 
Fifth Circuit are affirmed.
