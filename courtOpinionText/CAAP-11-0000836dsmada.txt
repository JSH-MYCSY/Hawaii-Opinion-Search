Upon review of the record, it appears that:

filed an "Ex Parte Motion to Waive Filing Fees and Surcharges Under Hawai' i Revised Statutes Chapter 607"; (2) on December 30, 
2011, this court denied the motion, ordered Scotto to pay the filing fee for the appeal within ten days from the date of the order, and stated that failure to pay the filing fee would result in dismissal of the appeal; (3) on January 9, 2012, this court denied Scotto's "Motion to Reconsider the December 30, 2011 Order Denying Petitioner Appellant's Motion to Waive Filing Fees and Surcharges Under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 607"; (4) Scotto has not paid the filing fee; and (5) Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(c) provides that "[f]ailure of the unsuccessful movant [to proceed in forma pauperis] to pay the unpaid filing fees . . . is ground for such action as the appellate court having jurisdiction over the appeal deems appropriate, and may include dismissal of the appeal."
