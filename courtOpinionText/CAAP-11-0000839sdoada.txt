NO. CAAP-11-0000839
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
YAN CHEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CR. NO. 1P111-5720)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Yan Chen (Chen) appeals from the
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order entered on October 18,
 
2011 by the Honolulu Division of the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit (District Court).  After a bench trial, Chen was found
 
guilty of Prostitution in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) ยง 712-1200(1) (1993 & Supp. 2011). 
Chen raises a single point of error, contending that
 
the District Court erred in adjudging Chen guilty of Prostitution
 
because the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove
 
that she engaged in, or agreed or offered to engage in, sexual
 
conduct with another person for a fee.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Russel S. Nagata presided.

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Chen's point of error as follows:
 
The standard of review on appeal for sufficiency of the 
evidence is substantial evidence. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
long held that evidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when
the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such
evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies
whether the case was before a judge or a jury. The test on
 appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence
to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed,
even if it could be said in a bench trial that the
 conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as
there is substantial evidence to support the requisite
findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material
element of the offense charged is credible evidence
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge is
free to make all reasonable and rational inferences
 under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial
evidence.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931
(1992).
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007).
 
Based upon the testimony of Detective Guy Yamashita,
 
which the District Court found to be credible [Tr. 36], and the
 
reasonable inferences arising from the circumstances surrounding
 
Chen's conduct, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to
support the District Court's conclusion that Chen intended to
 
engage in sexual conduct with Detective Yamashita in exchange for
the payment of a fee.
