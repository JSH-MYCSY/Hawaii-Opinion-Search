v.
 
JARRETT P. WOFFORD, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Ewa Division)
(CR. NO. 1P311-501)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jarrett P. Wofford (Wofford)
 
appeals from the Judgment filed on October 26, 2011, in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Wofford
 
was convicted of being an accomplice of another person in
 committing fourth-degree theft by shoplifting. Wofford's sole
 argument on appeal is that District Court erred in finding him
 guilty because there was insufficient evidence to support his
 conviction. We affirm.
 
The prosecution presented evidence that a Foodland loss
 
prevention agent observed: (1) Wofford and his female companion
 enter the Foodland store with a backpack; (2) the female placing
 three items, including a package of meat, into their shopping
 cart; (3) Wofford placing the three items into the backpack; (4)

the female grabbing the backpack; and (5) Wofford and the female
 
leaving the store without paying. Wofford and the female's
 version was that they walked into the Foodland store with the
 three items already in the backpack to purchase rice if it was on
 sale, but left the store upon discovering that rice was not on
 sale. The District Court resolved the conflicting evidence
 presented at trial by finding that the testimony of the loss
 prevention agent was more credible. Based on the loss prevention
 agent's testimony, the District Court found Wofford guilty. 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view 
the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981). "The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Richie, 
88 Hawai' i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (block quote format 
and citation omitted). We give "full play to the right of the finder of fact to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact." State v. Yabusaki, 58 Haw. 
404, 411, 570 P.2d 844, 848 (1977) (block quote format and citation omitted). 
Applying this standard of review, we conclude that
 
there was substantial evidence to support Wofford's conviction. 
Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's Judgment.
