JEFFREY LAMAR TUNLEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR NO. 09-1-2151)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jeffrey Lamar Tunley ("Tunley")
 
appeals from the Order Resentencing (Modified), filed on
 
October 25, 2011, in the Family Court of the First Circuit
 ("Family Court").

On February 25, 2010, the Family Court found Tunley
 
guilty of Criminal Contempt of Court, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ยง 710-1077(1)(g) (1993). In a summary
 disposition order in appellate case No. 30400, dated March 28,
 2011, this court vacated the original judgment and remanded the
 case for entry of a judgment stating the particular circumstances
 of the offense committed by Tunley and for re-sentencing before a
 different judge. On September 16, 2011, the Family Court entered
 the Findings and Judgment of Criminal Contempt of Court. On
 October 25, 2011, the Family Court filed the Order Resentencing

 The Honorable Darryl Y.C. Choy presided over the re-sentencing.

(Modified), which imposed a seven-day jail term.
 
On appeal, Tunley contends that (1) the Family Court
 
erred by admitting the testimony of Officer Will Scott regarding
 
the distance between Tunley and the complaining witness ("CW") as
 measured by a strollometer because the State failed to lay
 sufficient foundation concerning its accuracy and (2) there was
 insufficient evidence that Tunley approached or came within 100
 feet of or contacted the CW in violation of a temporary
 restraining order ("TRO"). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tunley's points of error as follows:
 
The State concedes that the Family Court erred by 
admitting the testimony of Officer Scott regarding the distance measured by a strollometer. Even if we were to conclude that the Family Court abused its discretion in admitting the distance measurement without sufficient foundation, however, we agree with the State that this does not render Tunley's conviction infirm because there was substantial evidence that Tunley violated the TRO issued against him on September 25, 2009 by contacting the CW. Tunley was prohibited from knowingly approaching or coming within 100 feet of the CW and from contacting the CW.

REV. STAT. ยง 710-1077(1)(g). Viewing the evidence in the 
strongest light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), Tunley

 The TRO mandated that Tunley not "contact, write, telephone, or
otherwise electronically contact (recorded message, pager, email, text
message, instant message, etc.)" the CW.

contacted the CW in violation of the TRO. 
The CW testified that it was her daily routine to go to
 
the Diamond Head Bark Park in the morning and that Tunley had
 
sometimes accompanied her there while they were still dating.3
 
The CW testified that Tunley did not live close to the dog park
 and had started exercising at a nearby location only after she
 and Tunley had stopped dating. Until that time, she said, she
 did not know Tunley to ever exercise. She also testified that
 prior to the issuance of the TRO, Tunley said to her: "I can go
 to the dog park every morning and every night and whatever
 happens, happens." The CW testified that on September 29, 2009,
 as she followed her dogs through the dog park, she noticed Tunley
 standing across the street from her, clasping his hands together
 and wriggling his wrists back and forth, looking straight at her,
 and grinning. The CW testified that Tunley remained there for at
 least a minute as she called the police. 
Tunley argues that he cannot be convicted of violating
 
the no-contact provision absent some sort of "verbal or
 linguistic communication." We disagree. The TRO prohibits
 contacting, writing, telephoning, or otherwise electronically
 contacting the CW. The common element to these proscribed acts
 is communication. Accord Cooper v. Cooper, 144 P.3d 451, 458 &
 
n.19 (Alaska 2006); see also Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
 Dictionary 268 (11th ed. 2003) (defining contact as "an

 Honolulu Police Department Officer William Lau testified that on
September 25, 2009, he served a TRO on Tunley that prohibited Tunley from coming
within 100 feet of or making contact with CW. According to Officer Lau, Tunley
said that he "always visited [Diamond Head Bark Park]." Officer Lau warned
 Tunley that it was "best to stay away from there because you never -- you don't
want to make a mistake and get arrested, you know, as far as the distance goes."

establishing of communication with someone or an observing or 
receiving of a significant signal from a person or object"). Tunley's lengthy staring and grinning at the CW were, while perhaps ambiguous, nonetheless communicative expressions. Based on the aforementioned context and the facts surrounding Tunley's contact with the CW, the Family Court was entitled to conclude that Tunley knowingly made contact with the CW in violation of the restraining order. See State v. Stanley, 110 Hawai' i 116, 
124, 129 P.3d 1144, 1152 (App. 2005); see also Cooper, 144 P.3d at 458 ("contact must involve some element of direct or indirect communication and does not merely mean coming within view"); State v. Lindell, No. 11-0822, 2012 WL 2819328, at *4 (Iowa Ct. App. July 11, 2012) (holding that eye contact between five and ten seconds violated an order prohibiting contact of any kind). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 25, 2011 Order
 
Resentencing (Modified), filed in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit, is affirmed.
