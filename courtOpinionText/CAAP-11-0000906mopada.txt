on Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed herein

of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
I. BACKGROUND
 
Suppa owns a one-eighth interest in "Lot 45-A" of Land
 
Court Application 828. Defendant-Appellee Association of
 Apartment Owners of the Kahala Beach (AOAO) leases Lot 229, which
 
contains a storm drainage system and a 30-inch diameter concrete
 
pipe that encroaches 30 feet from Lot 229 into Lot 45-A. On June
 
20, 2006, Suppa filed a complaint alleging claims of negligence,
 
trespass and nuisance, punitive damages and for an injunction
 
against the AOAO, based on the presence of the concrete pipe and
 
the pipe's discharge of water, silt, and debris gathered in the
 
drainage system.
 
The AOAO initially submitted two answers to Suppa's
 
complaint: one filed on August 2, 2006 by the AOAO's private
 
counsel, and one filed on August 11, 2006 by its defense counsel. 
The August 11, 2006 answer asserted an easement as a defense, but
 
the August 2, 2006 answer did not. The AOAO then filed an
 
amended answer on May 23, 2007 which omitted the language
 
discussing the easement, apparently by mistake. The AOAO also
 
filed a counterclaim against Suppa for negligence and trespass
 
and nuisance, alleging he had constructed an unauthorized
 
concrete wall.
 
On October 16, 2008, Suppa filed a motion for partial
 
summary judgment on his trespass and nuisance and injunction
 
claims and on the AOAO's counterclaims. Suppa submitted a
 
certified copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) issued
 
to him by the Land Court, which lists his interest in "Lot 45-A, 
1
 The Honorable Eden Elizabeth Hifo presided over the proceedings
relevant to this appeal.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Map 22, Land Court Application 828," and claimed his TCT does not
 
note any easement for the concrete pipe or the discharge of
 
water, silt, and debris.
 
The AOAO filed a cross-motion for summary judgment the
 
next day, asserting the existence of a drainage easement in Lot
 
45-A (Easement S) giving it the right to place the pipe and
 
discharge surface water. The AOAO attached as an exhibit Map 24,
 
which was filed with Land Court Application No. 828 and indicates
 
a designation of Easement S over Lot 45-A. On November 10, 2008,
 
Suppa and the AOAO filed oppositions to the other's motion for
 
summary judgment. In opposition to Suppa's motion for partial
 
summary judgment, the AOAO again submitted Map 24 and claimed
 
Easement S encumbers Suppa's interest.
 
On November 19, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing 
on the motions. The court denied Suppa's motion, as well as the 
AOAO's cross-motion. However, the circuit court granted summary 
judgment in favor of the AOAO on Suppa's motion. The court's 
reason for ruling in this manner was that the AOAO had filed two 
declarations accompanying Map 24, both submitted by the AOAO's 
attorney but with slight wording differences (discussed further 
below). The court found the declaration submitted with the 
AOAO's motion for summary judgment to be deficient, but found the 
declaration submitted with the AOAO's memorandum in opposition to 
Suppa's motion sufficient. The court admitted Map 24 as an 
ancient document pursuant to Hawai' i Rule of Evidence (HRE) 
901(b)(8) (1993) with respect to Suppa's motion for partial summary judgment, and it ruled Easement S was an express 
encumbrance granted in the AOAO's favor over Suppa's property. 
The circuit court granted partial summary judgment to
 
the AOAO on Suppa's claims, and the parties filed a stipulation
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to dismiss all remaining claims. Suppa timely appealed the
 
circuit court's November 2, 2011 judgment.2
 
We summarize Suppa's points of appeal as follows:
 (1) The circuit court erred in granting summary
 
judgment in the AOAO's favor based on its finding of an express
 easement (Easement S) over Suppa's land;
 
(2) The circuit court erred in allowing the AOAO to
 
submit evidence of an easement because the easement was an
 
affirmative defense that the AOAO waived by failing to include in
 
its amended answer;
 
(3) The circuit court erred in admitting Map 24 as an
 
ancient document because it was not authenticated; and
 
(4) The circuit court erred in denying Suppa's motion
 
for partial summary judgment.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawai' i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai' i 
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

 The circuit court initially entered judgment on February 5, 2009,
from which Suppa timely appealed. Under Appeal No. 29657, this court dismissed
the appeal because the judgment did not comply with the requirements of Jenkins
v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994). On 
November 2, 2011, the circuit court entered an amended stipulation and finaljudgment that did not differ substantively.

III.  DISCUSSION
A. The Circuit Court Erred In Granting Summary Judgment In
The AOAO's Favor
Suppa contends the circuit court erred in finding an
express easement (Easement S) encumbering his property.  Because
there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the AOAO
had the right to place the pipe and discharge water, silt, and
debris, we conclude the circuit court erred in granting summary
judgment to the AOAO. 
Relying on Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 501-82 and
501-88 (2006), Suppa argues his Land Court TCT is conclusive
evidence that there is no easement.  HRS § 501-82 states, in
relevant part:
§501-82  Tenure of holder of certificate of title. 
(a) Every applicant receiving a certificate of title in
pursuance of a decree of registration, and every subsequent
purchaser of registered land who takes a certificate of
title for value and in good faith, hold the same free from
all encumbrances except those noted on the certificate in
the order of priority of recordation[.]
HRS § 501-88 states:
§501-88  Certificate as evidence.  The original
certificate in the registration book, and any copy thereof
duly certified under the signature of the registrar or
assistant registrar, and the seal of the court, shall be
received as evidence in all the courts of the State and
shall be conclusive as to all matters contained therein,
except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
The circuit court apparently relied on two documents    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
when it found an express easement. The first document is Map 24,
 
a Land Court document entitled "Designation of Easement 'S'
 
Affecting Lot 45-A, as shown on Map 22." The map depicts
 
Easement S placed over Lot 45-A, and the circuit court concluded
 
Map 24 "expressly affects Lot 45-A . . . and expressly sets forth
 
[Easement S]." Suppa's TCT, however, contains no reference to
 
Map 24; it is unclear why, given that Map 24 was filed in 1966,
 
while Suppa's TCT was issued in 2006. Nevertheless, Suppa's TCT
 
refers only to Maps 22 and 29, and neither map was entered into
 
evidence. Map 29 is not in the record and apparently shows an
 
unrelated lot, Lot 238. Map 22, which is in the record as an
 
exhibit to Suppa's motion to certify the judgment, depicts Lot
 
45-A but does not contain any indication of Easement S. 
The second document the circuit court cited is Land
 
Court Document 1103430. Under a section entitled "Encumbrances,"
 
Suppa's TCT notes his interest is subject to the "[p]erpetual
 
covenants in Doc[] 1103430." Document 1103430 is a "Declaration
 
of Protective Provisions" (DPP) made in connection with the sale
 
of residential lots including Lot 45-A. The DPP lists covenants
 
running with the land and sets forth the maintenance obligations
 
of the co-tenants of Lot 45-A. Pursuant to HRS § 501-82(b),3 a
 
reference to a document containing an encumbrance can be
 sufficient to note an encumbrance on a certificate of title, and 
3
 HRS § 501-82(b) provides:
 
§501-82 Tenure of holder of certificate of title.
 
. . . .
 
(b) For the purposes of this section, an encumbrance shall be
deemed sufficiently noted on a certificate if the notation:
 
(1) References a document by name or number which
contains an encumbrance; and
 
(2) Indicates that the referenced document contains an
encumbrance to which the registered land is subject.
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
therefore Suppa's interest is subject to the DPP's covenants. 
However, the reference to the DPP on Suppa's TCT states Suppa's
 
interest is subject only to the "perpetual covenants" in the DPP,
 
giving no notice that the DPP contains any easements encumbering
 
Suppa's property. Moreover, nothing in the DPP itself expressly
 
grants a drainage easement to the AOAO or refers to the existence
 
of Easement S, and nothing in the record indicates any of the
 
other documents referenced under the "Encumbrances" section of
 
Suppa's TCT gives notice of Easement S.
 
The circuit court and the AOAO also rely on the DPP's
 
reference to the Owner's Certificate of Title No. 28,667 (Title
 
No. 28,667), the original title for Lot 45-A. Although the AOAO
 
claims Title No. 28,667 notes a designation of Easement S, Title
 
No. 28,667 was not in evidence and is not in the record. 
Instead, the AOAO relies on an Order of Subdivision directing the
 
Land Court to endorse a designation of Easement S on Title No.
 
28,667. Even assuming Easement S is properly noted on Title No.
 
28,667, however, we deem the reference to Easement S in this
 
manner to be an insufficient notice under HRS § 501-82(b). The
 
DPP's sole reference to Title No. 28,667 is located in the
 
property description section and only states: "All said Lots as
 
described in Owners' Transfer Certificate of Title No. 28667." 
HRS § 501-82 indicates the legislature's intent to require
 
encumbrances be noted with sufficient specificity to provide the
 
title holder with notice of the encumbrance. In this case, the
 
reference to the DPP on Suppa's TCT and the DPP itself gave no
 
notice of a drainage easement encumbering Suppa's land and did
 
not meet the requirements of HRS § 501-82(b).
 
Lastly, the AOAO argues the facts show an intent to
 
create a drainage easement. Evidence of intent alone does not
 
establish an express easement because "recognition of an express 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8easement in Hawai# i requires compliance with the land
registration statute, which is premised on preserving the
integrity of titles, rather than implementing the parties'
intent."  Ass'n. of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea
Resort Co., 100 Hawai# i 97, 122 n. 2, 58 P.3d 608, 633 n. 2
(2002) (Ramil, J., concurring).  Evidence of intent is relevant
to an implied easement theory, however.  The AOAO correctly
asserts that a valid unregistered encumbrance may be implied on
Land Court registered property, depending on the parties' intent
as shown by all the facts and circumstances under which the
conveyance was made.  Wailea Resort Co. , 100 Hawai #i at 106, 58
P.3d at 617.  See Henmi Apartments, Inc. v. Sawyer,  3 Haw. App.
555, 559, 655 P.2d 881, 885 (1982) ("Whether an implied easement
exists depends on the intent of the parties as shown by all the
facts and circumstances under which the conveyance was made.") 
At the summary judgment stage of this case, the AOAO
did not carry its burden of proof to establish an implied
easement.  The lack of a notation for a drainage easement on
Suppa's TCT is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material
fact as to whether an easement was intended.  Therefore, the
circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the AOAO.
B. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Denying Suppa's Motion
For Partial Summary Judgment
Suppa claims the circuit court erred when it denied his
motion for partial summary judgment for two reasons.  First, he
contends the existence of an easement is an affirmative defense
which the AOAO waived by omitting from its amended answer to
Suppa's complaint.  Although the AOAO asserted the easement in
its initial August 11, 2006 answer, Suppa contends the amended NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
answer supersedes the previous two answers.
 
Whether an affirmative defense has been waived due to a 
party's failure to plead the defense is a question of law 
reviewed de novo. Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 
F.3d 708, 713 (9th Cir. 2001). "The primary purpose of requiring affirmative defenses to be pleaded is to give notice to the 
parties of such defenses. . . . [I]ssues not raised by the 
pleadings [that] are tried by express or implied consent of the 
parties, . . . shall be treated in all respects as if they had 
been raised in the pleadings." Hawaii Broad. Co., Inc. v. Hawaii 
Radio, Inc., 82 Hawai' i 106, 112, 919 P.2d 1018, 1024 (1996) 
(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, the 
AOAO's August 11, 2006 answer sufficed to give notice to Suppa of 
the easement defense, and the AOAO consistently asserted the 
easement in its pre-trial statement, its motion for summary 
judgment, and its opposition to Suppa's motion. Additionally, 
Suppa has not claimed any prejudice from the AOAO's failure to 
assert the easement in its amended answer, nor is any suggested 
by the record. Suppa fully argued the issue of whether the AOAO 
had an easement both in his motion for summary judgment and at 
the hearing. Therefore, we conclude the circuit court did not 
err when it allowed the AOAO to assert Easement S as a defense. 
See also Camarillo v. McCarthy, 998 F.2d 638, 639 (9th Cir. 1993) 
(affirmative defense can be raised for the first time on summary 
judgment absent prejudice). 
Second, Suppa claims the circuit court erred by
 
admitting Map 24 as an ancient document because Map 24 was not
 
properly authenticated. We review the circuit court's rulings on
 
authentication under HRE Rule 901 for abuse of discretion. State
 
v. Konohia, 106 Hawai' i 517, 521, 107 P.3d 1190, 1194 (2005). 
HRE 901 provides that "[t]he requirement of authentication or 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is 
satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the
 
matter in question is what its proponent claims." In this case,
 
the circuit court concluded Map 24 was properly authenticated as
 
an ancient document and was admissible under the hearsay
 
exception for ancient documents. HRE 901(b)(8) states ancient
 
documents can be authenticated by evidence establishing the
 
document: "(A) is in such condition as to create no suspicion
 
concerning its authenticity, (B) was in a place where it, if
 
authentic, would likely be, and (C) has been in existence twenty
 
years or more at the time it is offered."
 The AOAO attached Map 24, dated May 20, 1966, as an
 
exhibit both to its memorandum in opposition to Suppa's motion
 
and to its motion for summary judgment. To authenticate the
 
exhibits, the AOAO attached declarations submitted by its
 
attorney. Suppa contends both declarations are defective because
 
neither indicates where Map 24 was found, thus failing to
 
establish Map 24 "was in a place where it, if authentic, would
 
likely be." HRE 901(b)(8)(B).
 
We conclude there was evidence in the record from which
 
the circuit court, in its discretion, might properly find Map 24
 
was obtained from the Land Court. The declaration submitted with
 
the AOAO's motion for summary judgment, which the circuit court
 
found defective, stated:
 
2. Attached hereto as Exhibit "A" is a true and correct copy
of Kamehame [sic] Schools Drainage Easement "S" was shown on
Map 24, filed with the Land Court Application No. 828, May
20, 1966. This document provides notice to the world that
Lot 45A is burdened by Easement "S."
 
The declaration the circuit court found sufficient to
 
authenticate Map 24 stated:
 
4. Attached hereto as Exhibit "2" is a true and correct copy
of Land Court document entitled Designation of Easement "S"
Affecting Lot 45A, as shown on Map 22, Land Court
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Application No. 828, referred to as Map 24, dated May 20,
1966.
 
The latter declaration's wording provided the circuit
 
court with a sufficient basis to find that Map 24 was found in
 
the Land Court. Nothing in the record creates suspicion
 
regarding Map 24's authenticity, and Suppa makes no argument and
 
cites no evidence indicating suspicion. The AOAO satisfied
 
HRE 901, and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when
 
it admitted Map 24.
 
We also conclude the circuit court did not err in
 
denying Suppa's motion for partial summary judgment. Based on
 
Map 24 and the other documents in the record, there remain
 
genuine issues of material fact as to whether the AOAO has the
 
right to place the pipe and discharge water, silt, and debris
 
over Suppa's property. Map 24 and the Order of Subdivision show
 
a designation of Easement S over Lot 45-A. Although Suppa
 
contends a designation is not the equivalent of a grant of
 
easement, the designation may be relevant to establishing the
 
parties' intent and to whether an implied easement exists. See
 
Henmi Apartments, Inc. v. Sawyer, 3 Haw. App. at 559, 655 P.2d at
 885. Therefore, summary judgment was not proper for either
 
party.
