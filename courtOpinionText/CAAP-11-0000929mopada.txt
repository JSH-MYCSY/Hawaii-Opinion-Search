STATE OF HAWAI

MOHOMIID A. WICKS, Defendant-Appellant
(CR. NO. 09-1-0847)
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Mohomiid A. Wicks (Wicks) timely
 
appeals from the Judgments entered by the Circuit Court of the
 
1
First Circuit (Circuit Court)  in Cr. Nos. 08-1-0988 (CAAP-11­
0000929, or "the Drug Case") and 09-1-0847 (CAAP-11-0000930, or
 
"the UEMV case"). 
The two cases were consolidated for
 
disposition pursuant to this court's June 12, 2012 Order.
 
In the Drug Case, Wicks entered no contest pleas to (1)
 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree (PDD3) in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1243 (Supp.
 
2012); (2) Unlawful Use of Drug Paraphernalia (Paraphernalia) in

 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided in both cases.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a) (2010); (3) Driving Without a
 
License in violation of HRS § 286-102 (2007 and Supp. 2012); (4)
 
and (6) Duty Upon Striking Unattended Vehicle or Other Property
 
in violation of HRS § 291C-15 (2007); (5) Promoting a Detrimental
 
Drug in the Third Degree in violation of HRS § 712-1249 (1993);
 
(7) Reckless Driving of Vehicle in violation of HRS § 291-2
 
(2007); and (8) Obedience to Police Officer in violation of HRS §
 
291C-23 (2007).
 
In the UEMV case, Wicks pleaded no contest to
 
Unauthorized Entry Into Motor Vehicle in the First Degree (UEMV)
 
in violation of HRS § 708-836.5 (Supp. 2012).
 
Wicks argues four main points of error with regard to
 
the Drug Case: (1) that his no contest pleas were not knowingly,
 
intelligently, and voluntarily entered; (2) that the Circuit
 
Court failed to inquire as to the pre-sentence report; (3) that
 
sentencing was held after he fired his attorney; and (4) that his
 
counsel was ineffective.
 
With regard to the UEMV case, Wicks argues that his
 
sentence was imposed in derogation of his right to be present at
 
sentencing, his right to allocution, and his right to review and
 
controvert his presentence report.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Wicks's points of
 
error as follows:
 
1. Entry of Plea
 
We conclude that Wicks's plea to all charges was
 
entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.2 No motion to

Q. Did you go over these forms with your lawyer before

A. Yes.
 Q. And did you read and understand these forms before
you signed it?
 
A. Yes.

A. Yes.
 
Q. And you understand for Promoting a Dangerous Drug

A. Yes.
 
. . . .
 Q. (By the Court:) Now, knowing the penalties that you

Q. Do you have any questions about any of these
rights?
 
A. No.
 
Q. Okay. Now, you understand that by pleading no
contest today, there will be no trial and you're giving up
all of these rights?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And you also understand that if I later sentence
you and you don't like the sentence, you cannot later on
change your mind and ask to have a trial?
 
A. Yeah.

 A. No.
 Q. Are you pleading no contest of your own free will?
 A. Yes.

you?
 
A. No, Your Honor.
 Q. Have you fully discussed your plea with your
lawyer?

 Q. Did you go over with your lawyer all of your
possible defenses to each of these charges?

withdraw has been filed, so the applicable "standard of review
 
for the withdrawal of a nolo contendere plea after sentencing is
 
based on a showing of necessity to avoid manifest injustice." 
State v. Cornelio , 68 Haw. 644, 646, 727 P.2d 1125, 1126 (1986). 
Wicks contends that he did not have the requisite
 
awareness of the circumstances and consequences surrounding his
 
plea because he did not believe that mandatory minimum sentencing
 
applied to him and because he was erroneously told that he could
 
fight his case "from Habilitat". His contentions are belied by
 
the exchange he participated in with the Circuit Court. See 
Cornelio, 68 Haw. at 646, 727 P.2d at 1127 ("[T]here is no
 manifest injustice when the trial court has made an affirmative
 
showing by an on-the-record colloquy between the court and the
 
defendant wherein the defendant is shown to have a full
 
understanding of what the plea of guilty connotes and its
 
consequences.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
2. Allocution
 
However, with regard to sentencing, our review of the
 
record reveals that Wicks may not have been present for
 
sentencing on all offenses and was not clearly advised of his
 
opportunity for allocution as to all charges before he was
 
sentenced.
 
A defendant's right to pre-sentence allocution is 
described in HRS § 706-604(1) (1993). 
It provides that "[b]efore 
imposing sentence, the court shall afford a fair opportunity to the defendant to be heard on the issue of the defendant's 
disposition." Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 32(a) 
also requires that "[b]efore suspending or imposing sentence, the court shall address the defendant personally and afford a fair 
opportunity to the defendant and defendant's counsel, if any, to 
make a statement and present any information in mitigation of 
2(...continued)
Q. Are you satisfied with his advice?
 
A. Yes.

punishment."
 
At the September 28, 2011 first sentencing hearing,
 
both cases were called. The Circuit Court first entertained the
 
State's motion for repeat offender sentencing and a vigorous
 
discussion ensued. After ruling on the motion, the Circuit Court
 
addressed Wicks, informed him that "this is sentencing" and that
 
before the court imposed sentence, Wicks was entitled to "make
 
any statement you want." The Circuit Court did not specify which
 
case or charge it was intending to impose sentence on. The
 
entire hearing, up until that point, had been on the State's
 
motion for repeat offender sentencing, which applied only to the
 
PDD3 charge.
 
Wicks made his statement, which began discussing the
 
merits of the State's motion and the Circuit Court cut short this
 
discussion on the basis that Wicks was making a legal argument. 
Wicks then spoke on how he conducted his life after the 2008 Drug
 
Case, but did not speak specifically to any particular charge or
 
charges or mention the UEMV incident. Our review of the record
 
reveals that this was the only statement Wicks made before the
 
Circuit Court imposed sentence on the UEMV and Drug Cases. Based
 
on this record, we cannot conclude that Wicks understood which
 
case, let alone which charges he would be speaking to when he was
 
given this opportunity for allocution. Therefore, we conclude
 
that he was not afforded a full opportunity for allocution on all
 
the charges for which he was to be sentenced.
 
In Hawai' i, it is established that "[t]he remedy for 
denial of Defendant's right of allocution is resentencing." 
State v. Chow, 77 Hawai' i 241, 248, 883 P.2d 663, 670 (App. 
1994). A showing of prejudice is not required in order to obtain remand for resentencing. See id., at 249, 883 P.2d at 671; 
Schutter v. Soong, 76 Hawai' i 187, 208, 873 P.2d 66, 87 (1994). 
On remand, the resentencing is to be had before another judge. 
State v. Schaefer, 117 Hawai' i 490, 498, 184 P.3d 805, 813 (App. 
2008); Schutter v. Soong at 208, n.6, 873 P.2d at 87, n.6 (even though the trial court judge conducted himself with the utmost 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judicial decorum and impartiality, remanding the matter to the
 
same judge would be inadequate because that judge previously
 
determined the appropriate length of the sentence).
 
3. Presence at sentencing
 
3
HRPP Rule 43(a)  requires the presence of the defendant
at every stage of the proceeding, from the arraignment to the 
imposition of the sentence. It is well-settled that there is a 
"fundamental right to be present at each critical stage of the 
criminal proceeding." State v. Walsh
, 125 Hawai' i 271, 285, 260 
P.3d 350, 364 (2011) (quoting Onaka v. Onaka, 112 Hawai' i 374, 
380, 146 P.3d 89, 95 (2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Wicks was present at the September 28, 2011 first
 
sentencing hearing, but the transcript does not reflect that the
 
sentence for the UEMV charge and the sentence for the
 
Paraphernalia charge were pronounced at that proceeding. 
Furthermore, at the October 26, 2011 hearing, when the Circuit
 
Court sentenced Wicks on Counts 3-8 and clarified that an
 
indeterminate five-year term was to be imposed on all three
 
felony charges, it is unclear from the transcript whether Wicks
 
was present. Under these circumstances, we conclude that a new
 
sentencing hearing should be held. See U.S. v. Rodriguez, 23
 
F.3d 919, 920 (5th Cir. 1994) (quoting U.S. v. Velasquez, 748
 
F.2d 972, 974 (5th Cir. 1984) ("Once it is found that the
 
district court failed to comply with a procedural rule of
 
3
 HRPP Rule 43(a) states, "Presence required. The defendant shall be
 
present at the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at evidentiary pretrial
hearings, at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and
the return of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as
otherwise provided by this rule."
 
The Hawai' i Rule is similar to the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 
Rule 43(a)(3), which states that unless otherwise provided for, "the defendantmust be present at: . . . sentencing." 
Presence is particularly key to sentencing because of the right of
allocution. § 723 Defendant's Right to Be Present – Alteration of Sentence, 3B
Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. § 722 (3d ed.).

sentencing, a new sentencing hearing should be ordered."))
 
(internal quotation marks omitted).
 
Based on our resolution of these issues, it is
 
unnecessary to address Wicks's other points on appeal.
 
Accordingly, the October 26, 2011 Judgment entered by
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in CAAP-11-0000929 and the
 
September 30, 2011 Second Amended Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence in CAAP-11-0000930 are vacated and both cases are
 
remanded for resentencing before a different judge.
