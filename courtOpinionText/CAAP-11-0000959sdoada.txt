NO. CAAP-11-0000959 and CAAP-11-0001098
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
CHRISTOPHER KALACINSKI, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
RITCHELLE DUNKLE, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DOMESTIC ABUSE NO. 11-1-7266)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Ritchelle Dunkle (Dunkle) appeals
 
from the Order for Protection, entered on October 26, 2011 in the
 
Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).1
 
On October 26, 2011, after a hearing, the Family Court
 
entered an Order for Protection finding that "The Respondent has
 
failed to show cause why the Temporary Restraining Order should
 
not be continued."
 
On November 23, 2011, the Family Court received a
 
Notice of Appeal by Dunkle, which was filed on November 28, 2011. 
An appeal was docketed as CAAP-11-0000959.
 
On December 21, 2011, the Family Court issued an order
 
denying Dunkle's Motion for Extension of Time to File The Notice
 
of Appeal.
 
On December 27, 2011, Dunkle filed another Notice of
 
Appeal from the Order for Protection and order denying Dunkle's
 
1
 The Honorable Lanson K. Kupau presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Motion for Extension of Time to File The Notice of Appeal. An
 
appeal was docketed as CAAP-11-0001098.
 
On January 25, 2012, this court ordered that both
 
appeals be consolidated under CAAP-11-0000959.
 
On January 26, 2012, the Family Court issued its
 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. On February 13, 2012,
 
the Family Court issued another set of Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law.
 
On appeal, Dunkle challenges the Findings of Fact (FOF)
 
Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 40 and
 
Conclusion of Law (COL) Nos. 29 and 52 from the February 13, 2012
 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Dunkle also contends
 
that the judge's "failure to recuse himself from adjudicating
 
Appellant's Motion violated rules and principles of due process
 
and judicial conduct and warrants his denial of Appellant's
 
Motion to be vacated."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Dunkle's points of error as follows:
 
Contrary to Dunkle's claim, FOF 21 and 22 are not 
clearly erroneous. "It is well-settled that an appellate court 
will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of 
witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of 
the trier of fact." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawaif i 41, 46, 137 
P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Dunkle claims that FOF 10, 11, 12, and 13 are
 
unsupported by substantial evidence because Kalacinski "did not
 
produce any evidence outside of his testimony to support these
 
claims."
 
[T]he question on appeal is whether the record contains
"substantial evidence" supporting the family court's
determinations, and appellate review is thereby limited to
assessing whether those determinations are supported by
"credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative
value." In this regard, the testimony of a single witness,
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
if found by the trier of fact to have been credible, will
suffice. 
In re Doe, 95 Hawaif i 183, 196, 20 P.3d 616, 629 (2001) 
(citations omitted). 
Kalacinski testified that on July 11, 2011, Dunkle
 
"threw the phone in the direction of my head. If I would not
 
have ducked, it would have struck me in the face." Kalacinski
 
also testified that the phone was damaged when it had two black
 
dots on the screen where he cannot read anything. He also
 
testified that after Dunkle threw the phone, she came at him and
 
caused scratch marks down his arms resulting in bleeding. 
Kalacinski then stated that Dunkle then struck him across the
 
left side of his face with both an open and closed hand. As
 
explained above, the Family Court did not err by finding that
 
Kalacinski was credible. Kalacinski's testimony constituted
 
substantial evidence to support FOF 10, 11, 12, and 13. 
Therefore, FOF 10, 11, 12, and 13 are not clearly erroneous.
 
Contrary to Dunkle's claim, FOF 15, 17, and 18 are not 
clearly erroneous. On appeal, Dunkle admits that Kalacinski 
"testified that Appellant called him seventy-two times in August 
and twenty-three times on September 16th," but claims that these 
statements lacked foundation because the calls were made from a 
"restricted" number and that without more the Family Court should 
not have found that Dunkle made those calls. Dunkle also claims 
that Kalacinski failed to produce his ex-wife and friends to 
testify, therefore, his testimony lacked foundation and 
constituted inadmissible hearsay which cannot amount to 
substantial evidence. Dunkle did not object to lack of 
foundation or on the basis of hearsay when Kalacinski made those 
statements. In her points of error, Dunkle does not cite where 
she objected for lack of foundation or hearsay to Kalacinski's 
testimony. Therefore, any error is waived. Hawaif i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). 
Contrary to Dunkle's claim, FOF 23 and 24 are not
 
wrong. Dunkle failed to show cause why the temporary restraining
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
order against her should not be continued. In addition, there
 
was substantial evidence that a protective order was necessary to
 
prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-1 (2006) defines
 
domestic abuse as:
 
(1) Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of
imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, extreme
psychological abuse or malicious property damage between
family or household members; or
 
(2) Any act which would constitute an offense under section
709-906, or under part V or VI of chapter 707 committed
against a minor family or household member by an adult
family or household member.
 
There was substantial evidence to support the Family
 
Court's findings that Dunkle caused physical harm, bodily injury,
 
and/or assault; malicious property damage; and extreme
 
psychological injury.
 
Judicial Misconduct
 
In her points of error, Dunkle claims that the
 
presiding judge violated rules of judicial conduct, due process,
 
and evidence in relation to FOF 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23,
 
and 24 and COL 29.
 
In the argument section of her Opening Brief, Dunkle
 
does not provide any argument that the presiding judge violated
 
rules of judicial conduct, due process, and evidence in relation
 
to FOF 10, 18, 23, and 24. Therefore, those points of error are
 
waived. HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
 
Dunkle argues that the presiding judge was not
 
impartial and unduly interfered with Kalacinski's testimony on
 
direct examination, cross-examination of Kalacinksi by Dunkle's
 
counsel, and examination of Dunkle by her counsel. Dunkle claims
 
that she was prejudiced by the undue interference and judicial
 
misconduct. Dunkle also claims that the Family Court made
 
several erroneous evidentiary decisions that prejudiced her.
 
FOF 11
 
With respect to FOF 11, Dunkle argues that "by
 
interrupting Appellee's testimony to ask about damage to his cell
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
phone, Judge Kupau not only asked leading questions 'not aimed at
 
clarifying certain points' but did so to 'confirm [. . .] the
 
necessary elements' of malicious property damage under HRS § 586­
1."
 
We note that Kalacinski was not represented by counsel
 
and thus, there was no counsel to question him on direct
 
examination once he took the stand. Dunkle failed to object to
 
the Family Court's questions. Thus, any error with respect to
 
FOF 11 is waived. Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 103. 
FOF 15 and 17
 
Dunkle also did not object to any question by the
 
Family Court and did not object to Kalacinski's responses. 
Therefore, any errors with respect to the questioning and
 
testimony related to FOF 15 and 17 are waived.
 
Exhibit 1, FOF 21 and 22 and COL 29(2) and (3)
 
Dunkle claims that the Family Court unduly interfered
 
with her counsel's cross-examination of Kalacinski by preventing
 
him from using Dunkle's Exhibit 1 to elicit an admission from
 
Kalcinski. Dunkle claims that the Family Court's action also
 
violated HRE Rule 613. Dunkle argues that this error affected
 
the credibility of Kalacinski and Dunkle, as determined by the
 
Family Court in FOF 21 and 22.
 
On appeal, Dunkle claims that her counsel was
 
improperly prohibited from using Exhibit 1 to elicit an admission
 
from Kalcinski.2 Dunkle cites HRE 613(a) and (b) which state:
 
Rule 613 Prior statements of witnesses.  (a)
Examining witness concerning prior statement. In
 
examining a witness concerning a prior statement made
by the witness, whether written or not, the statement
need not be shown nor its contents disclosed to the
 witness at that time, but on request the same shall be
shown or disclosed to opposing counsel.
 
(b) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent
statement of witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior
inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible
unless, on direct or cross-examination, (1) the
 
2
 Dunkle's Exhibit 1 is not part of the record on appeal.
Therefore, this court is unable to examine its content.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstances of the statement have been brought to the
attention of the witness, and (2) the witness has been asked
whether the witness made the statement.
 
From the record available, it appears that counsel
 
intended to use Exhibit 1 to obtain Kalacinski's admission that
 
he made certain statements to Dunkle, and to have the exhibit
 
admitted into evidence as extrinsic evidence. However, Dunkle's
 
counsel admitted that there was nothing on the face of Exhibit 1
 
that linked Kalacinski to any statements therein and that
 
foundation would be made by Dunkle's testimony later. Until
 
proper foundation was laid, counsel could not use Exhibit 1 to
 
obtain an admission from Kalacinski. Counsel was not prohibited
 
from inquiring whether Kalacinski made statements to Dunkle,
 
without reference to Exhibit 1. The Family Court also did not
 
err in refusing to admit Exhibit 1 in evidence as Dunkle never
 
laid a proper foundation for its admission. Therefore, the
 
Family Court did not unduly interfere with the cross-examination
 
of Kalacinski or violate HRE Rule 613.
 
Contrary to Dunkle's claim, the Family Court did not
 
disregard rules of judicial conduct and evidence in relation to
 
COL 29(2) and 29(3) by asking leading questions regarding the
 
elements of malicious property damage and by eliciting hearsay
 
testimony about calls from a restricted telephone number.
 
Lastly, Dunkle claims that the Family Court committed 
erroneous evidentiary decisions such as (1) preventing "Appellant 
from fully testifying of how Appellee's false claims of abuse 
affected her," (2) excluding Exhibit 1 from being entered into 
evidence and (3) allowing Kalacinski to introduce new facts 
during his closing argument that were not in evidence. In the 
section of her Opening Brief titled "Points of Error," Dunkle 
failed to specifically assert these errors. Therefore, the 
alleged errors are waived. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4); Kawamata Farms 
Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawaif i 214, 234-35, 948 P.2d 
1055, 1075-76 (1997).

FOF 40 and COL 52
 
Dunkle timely filed a Notice of Appeal when it was
 
submitted to the Family Court on November 23, 2011. Therefore,
 
Dunkle was not required to obtain an extension of time to file a
 
notice of appeal from the Family Court. Even if the Family Court
 
erred by denying Dunkle's Motion for Extension of Time to File
 
the Notice of Appeal and FOF 40 and COL 52 are wrong, it was
 
harmless error.
 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order for Protection,
 
entered on October 26, 2011 in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaif i, March 19, 2013.
