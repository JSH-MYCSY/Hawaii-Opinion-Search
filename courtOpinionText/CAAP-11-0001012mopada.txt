I. BACKGROUND
 
The following facts are not disputed. On February 15, 
2007, a Hawai fi County Police Department vice officer received 
information from a confidential informant about drug activities 
at a property and residence in the District of Puna, County of 
Hawaifi. The informant described the property as a church with 
an adjoining greenhouse containing approximately sixty marijuana plants growing inside. 
That same day, the officer and two other law
 
enforcement officers drove to the property. The officer
 
immediately smelled a strong odor of marijuana and, while
 
standing on the church's driveway, spotted a three-foot tall
 
marijuana plant outdoors. Several people, including Harris,
 
approached the officers on the property, identified themselves as
 
members of the church, and stated they had a right to grow
 
marijuana. Harris identified herself as the president of the
 
Sacred Truth Mission, and she said she was responsible for the
 
property and did not have a medical marijuana permit. One man
 
handed the officers a document stating: "Recognized Rastafarian,
 
Mandated to Smoke Copious Quantities of Marijuana in the Chalice
 
and to Grow Enormous Crops of Ganja[.]"
 
The officers arrested Harris and the man and secured
 
the property while one of the officers obtained a search warrant. 
The officer submitted the warrant at 10:27 p.m. on the same day. 
The warrant was approved and issued, and it indicated the warrant
 
could be executed "at any time of day or night." The officers
 
then commenced a search and seizure of evidence pursuant to the
 
warrant.
 
On August 23, 2007, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
fi 
(State) indicted Harris for violations of HRS §§ 712-1249.4(1), 
329-43.5, and 712-1248(1). On February 19, 2009, Harris filed 
her "Motions To Suppress Evidence And Dismiss Complaint For 
Remedy Of State And Federal Constitutional Violations And For 
Heightened Judicial Scrutiny." Harris argued the seized evidence 
should be suppressed because the warrant was invalid. Harris 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
also claimed her prosecution violated a number of rights under 
the United States Constitution and the Hawai fi Constitution. 
The circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing on
 
Harris's motion, which included testimony regarding Harris's
 
religious beliefs and practices as a Rastafarian. On November 3,
 
2010, it entered its FOFCOL denying Harris's motion. The case
 
proceeded to a jury trial, and the jury found Harris guilty as
 
charged on all counts. The circuit court entered its Judgment on
 
November 7, 2011, sentencing Harris to probation for concurrent
 
terms of five and ten years; imprisonment for concurrent terms of
 
two years, one year, and thirty days; and several monetary
 
assessments. Harris filed a timely notice of appeal from the
 
Judgment on November 30, 2011.
 
Harris raises several points on appeal essentially
 
contending the circuit court erred in entering its FOFCOL denying
 
her motion to dismiss the counts and to suppress evidence. 
Harris also argues the circuit court committed several errors
 
during the jury trial on the counts against her.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law
 A trial court's findings of fact are reviewed under the
 
"clearly erroneous" standard of review. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai
fi 
423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994). 
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record
lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2)
despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the
appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been made. The circuit
 court's conclusions of law are reviewed under the
 right/wrong standard.
 
State v. Locquiao, 100 Hawai fi 195, 203, 58 P.3d 1242, 1250 
(2002) (quoting State v. Harada, 98 Hawai fi 18, 22, 41 P.3d 174, 
178 (2002)). "A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial 
court's findings of fact and that reflects an application of the 
correct rule of law will not be overturned." Dan, 76 Hawai fi at 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
428, 879 P.2d at 533 (internal quotation marks and citations
 
omitted).
 
B. Constitutional Questions
 
The appellate court answers "questions of 
constitutional law by exercising our own independent judgment based on the facts of the case. Thus, [the court reviews] 
questions of constitutional law under the 'right/wrong' 
standard." State v. Fields, 115 Hawai
fi 503, 511, 168 P.3d 955, 
963 (2007) (internal quotation marks, citation, and ellipsis omitted). 
Where it is alleged that the legislature has acted 
unconstitutionally, the Hawai
fi Supreme Court has long held that 
"(1) legislative enactments are presumptively constitutional; (2) a party challenging a statutory scheme has the burden of
 
showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt; and
 
(3) the constitutional defect must be clear, manifest, and 
unmistakable." Convention Ctr. Auth. v. Anzai, 78 Hawai
fi 157, 
162, 890 P.2d 1197, 1202 (1995) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
C. Admissibility Of Evidence
 
[D]ifferent standards of review must be applied to
trial court decisions regarding the admissibility of
evidence, depending on the requirements of the
particular rule of evidence at issue. When
 application of a particular evidentiary rule can yield
only one correct result, the proper standard for
appellate review is the right/wrong standard.
However, the traditional abuse of discretion standard
should be applied in the case of those rules of
evidence that require a "judgment call" on the part of
the trial court.
 
Kealoha v. Cnty. of Hawai' i, 74 Haw. 308, 319-20, 844 P.2d
670, 676 (1993). 
State v. Heggland, 118 Hawai fi 425, 434, 193 P.3d 341, 350 
(2008). 
D. Discovery
 
A ruling limiting discovery is reviewed for an abuse of 
discretion. State v. Peseti, 101 Hawai fi 172, 178, 65 P.3d 119, 
125 (2003). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
E.	 Juror Misconduct
 
As a general matter, the granting or denial of a motion for
new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court
 and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of
 discretion. The same principle is applied in the context of
a motion for new trial premised on juror misconduct. 
The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly
exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.
 
. . . . 
. . . Because the right to an impartial jury in a
criminal trial is so fundamental to our entire judicial
system, . . . a criminal defendant is entitled to twelve
impartial jurors. Thus, the trial court must grant a motion
for new trial if any member (or members) of the jury was not
impartial; failure to do so necessarily constitutes an abuse
of discretion.
 
State v. Augustin, 89 Hawai fi 215, 219, 971 P.2d 304, 308 (App. 
1998) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Furutani, 76 Hawai fi 
172, 178-79, 873 P.2d 51, 57-58 (1994)). 
F.	 Cruel And Unusual Punishment 
In State v. Solomon, 107 Hawai fi 117, 111 P.3d 12 
(2005), the Hawai fi Supreme Court held that the appellate court 
addresses arguments of cruel and unusual punishment pursuant
to the following standard:
 
The standard by which punishment is to be
judged under the "cruel and unusual" punishment
provisions of both the United States and Hawaii
Constitutions is whether, in the light of
developing concepts of decency and fairness, the
prescribed punishment is so disproportionate to
the conduct proscribed and is of such duration
as to shock the conscience of reasonable persons
or to outrage the moral sense of the community.
 
Id. at 131, 111 P.3d at 26 (internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted) (quoting State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai fi 87, 114, 997 P.2d 
13, 40 (2000)). "The question of what constitutes an adequate penalty necessary for the prevention of crime is addressed to the 
sound judgment of the legislature and the courts will not 
interfere with its exercise, unless the punishment prescribed 
appears clearly and manifestly to be cruel and unusual." 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai
fi at 114, 997 P.2d at 40 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). In Solomon, the Hawai fi Supreme 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Court set forth the three-prong test that the court considered in
 
determining whether a punishment was "clearly and manifestly"
 
cruel and unusual: 
(1) the nature of the offense and/or the offender, with
particular regard to the degree of danger posed by both to
society; (2) the extent of the challenged penalty as
compared to the punishments prescribed for more serious
crimes within the same jurisdiction; and (3) the extent of
the challenged penalty as compared to the punishment
prescribed for the same offense in other jurisdictions. 
107 Hawai fi at 132, 111 P.3d at 27 (quoting Jenkins, 93 Hawai fi at 
114, 997 P.2d at 40). "In using this test, the nature of the 
offense and the danger the offender poses to society are the key 
factors in this determination." Solomon, 107 Hawai fi at 132, 111 
P.3d at 27 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Dismissal Of Counts
 
In her motion seeking dismissal of the counts against 
her, Harris claimed her prosecution for possessing marijuana violated a number of constitutional rights under the United 
States Constitution and the Hawai
fi Constitution. 
Harris's claim based on the free exercise clauses of 
the U.S. and Hawai fi Constitutions is unavailing because State v. 
Sunderland, 115 Hawai fi 396, 168 P.3d 526 (2007) applies. In 
Sunderland, the Hawai fi Supreme Court concluded HRS § 712-1249 
(1993) ("Promoting a detrimental drug in the third degree") is a neutral law of general applicability and does not create a 
mechanism allowing an individualized government assessment for 
exemptions, and therefore the free exercise clause is not a 
viable defense to prosecution. Id. at 403-04, 168 P.3d at 533-34 
(applying the rule in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990); see also State v. Kimmel, 
No. 28893 (App. Jan. 23, 2009) (SDO) (applying Sunderland to 
defendant's prosecution under HRS §§ 712-1249.5 (1993) and 329­
43.5)). 
Harris also contends she has pled a hybrid of
 
constitutional rights warranting strict scrutiny analysis of all
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of her claims. A "hybrid" case is one in which a claim under the
 
U.S. Constitution's free exercise clause can be linked to another 
constitutional claim and may thereby merit strict scrutiny review 
rather than the analysis used in Smith and Sunderland. See 
Smith, 494 U.S. at 881 ("The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally 
applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved . . 
. the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other 
constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the 
press."). In Sunderland, the Hawai
fi Supreme Court noted that 
case did not involve a hybrid rights situation because on appeal the defendant had failed to preserve his constitutional right to 
privacy argument, and the court expressed no opinion on the 
meaning and application of Smith's language regarding "hybrid 
situations." Sunderland, 115 Hawai
fi at 404 n.10, 168 P.3d at 
534 n.10. 
The circuit court concluded Harris failed to present a
 
hybrid claim and we agree. Harris's motion seeking dismissal and
 her opening brief state in a conclusory manner that her
 
prosecution violates multiple constitutional rights. Harris
 
provides almost no argument and states no facts to support these
 
general claims. Although the application and scope of the hybrid
 
2
claim doctrine is unclear,  it cannot be true that a party can
merely invoke a number of rights without support or detail,
 
combine it with a claimed free-exercise right, and thereby force
 
the government to demonstrate a compelling state interest. See,
 
e.g., Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1999)
 (requiring at minimum a "colorable claim" that a companion right
 
2
 See, e.g., Kissinger v. Bd. of Trustees of Ohio State Univ., 5
 
F.3d 177, 180 (6th Cir. 1993) (rejecting the "hybrid" claims doctrine as
"completely illogical"); EEOC v. Catholic Univ. of Am., 83 F.3d 455, 467 (D.C.
Cir. 1996) (requiring an independently viable claim of interference with a
companion constitutional right); see generally Note, The Best of A Bad Lot:
Compromise and Hybrid Religious Exemptions, 123 Harv. L. Rev. 1494 (2010)
(identifying and describing disagreement among courts and commentators).
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
has been violated: a fair probability or a likelihood, but not a
 
certitude, of success on the merits).
 
One of Harris's companion claims is that her 
prosecution infringes upon her right to privacy under the Hawai fi 
Constitution. She argues she should be free to grow and consume marijuana in the privacy of the church property. However, in 
State v. Mallan, 86 Hawai
fi 440, 446, 950 P.2d 178, 184 (1998), a 
plurality of the Hawai fi Supreme Court stated "the purported 
right to possess and use marijuana is not a fundamental right and 
a compelling state interest is not required." See also 
Sunderland, 115 Hawai fi at 408, 168 P.3d at 538 (stating the 
purported right to possess and use marijuana, which is not a 
fundamental right, is not transformed into a fundamental right 
when the activity is conducted in the home) (Moon, C.J., 
concurring and dissenting); Kimmel, SDO at 3. 
Harris also claims the statutes violate her equal 
protection rights under the U.S. and Hawai fi Constitutions. The 
equal protection clause "is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." City of 
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). Harris bases her argument on the fact that HRS § 281-101.5(b)(2) 
(2007 Repl.) permits possession of liquor by a minor in 
connection with the minor's participation in religious ceremonies 
and that federal law contains certain exemptions for peyote under 
21 C.F.R. § 1307.31. However, there is no religious 
classification in the statutes under which Harris was charged, 
and because no suspect classification or fundamental right is 
involved, our inquiry is whether there is a rational basis for 
the challenged statute. State v. Hatori, 92 Hawai
fi 217, 225, 
990 P.2d 115, 123 (App. 1999). Courts have held that the Rastafarian faith is not similarly situated to religions covered 
by exemption statutes because its marijuana use is not 
controlled, McBride v. Shawnee Cnty., Kansas Court Servs., 71 F. 
Supp. 2d 1098, 1101 (D. Kan. 1999); State v. McBride, 955 P.2d 
133, 139 (Kan. Ct. App. 1998), and moreover marijuana can be 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rationally distinguished from other substances for the purposes 
of equal protection analysis. Hatori, 92 Hawai fi at 226, 990 
P.2d at 124. There is no equal protection clause violation. 
We further reject Harris's claim that the statutes are 
void for vagueness. "A penal statute is vague if a person of ordinary intelligence cannot obtain an adequate description of 
the prohibited conduct or how to avoid committing illegal acts." 
State v. Bui, 104 Hawai
fi 462, 464, 92 P.3d 471, 473 (2004) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). The statutes at issue here are not vague because they describe the proscribed conduct in 
understandable terms and adequately inform a person on how to 
avoid committing the offense. The statutory provisions on the 
medical use of marijuana do not create vagueness because the 
statutes adequately define terms such as "debilitating medical 
condition," "qualifying patient," and "written certification" 
needed to fall within the medical use statutory scheme. 
B. Suppression Of Evidence
 
Harris also moved to suppress evidence before trial,
 
claiming the search warrant was invalid. Harris argues: (1) the
 confidential informant's tip was not trustworthy and could not be
 
used to establish probable cause; (2) the officer defaced the
 
warrant; (3) the warrant was vague because it failed to
 
distinguish between criminal and innocent possession of
 
marijuana; and (4) the warrant did not specifically list exigent
 
circumstances authorizing a nighttime search. All of Harris's
 
challenges to the warrant are without merit.
 
(1) The informant's tip provided probable cause because 
it was corroborated by officers who visited the area before 
obtaining the warrant. State v. Detroy, 102 Hawai
fi 13, 19-20, 
72 P.3d 485, 491-92 (2003) (stating that an officer's corroboration of an informant's tip could properly support the 
conclusion that the informant was truthful). The affidavit 
submitted in support of the warrant stated the officers had 
immediately smelled a strong odor of marijuana, observed a three-
foot marijuana plant while standing on the driveway, and spoke 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with several people on the property who identified themselves as
 
members of the church and asserted the right to grow marijuana.
 
(2) and (3) The circuit court found the warrant had
 
been properly signed and approved by a judge, and nothing in the
 
record supports Harris's allegation of defacement or indicates
 
the court clearly erred in its finding. The record also belies
 
Harris's claim that the officer fabricated statements in the
 
affidavit in support of the warrant and that the police failed to
 
document Harris's claims of religious use. Moreover, the warrant
 
was sufficiently particular, and Harris provides no authority for
 
her claim to "innocent possession of marijuana."
 
(4) The warrant's authorization of a nighttime search 
was not invalid. "Although it would be good practice for judges 
authorizing nighttime searches to include a separate paragraph on 
the face of the warrant specifically acknowledging the deviation 
from the ordinary prohibition against such searches . . . there 
is no requirement that a nighttime search warrant list exigent 
circumstances or contain a specific finding[.]" State v. 
Richardson, 80 Hawai fi 1, 3, 904 P.2d 886, 888 (1995) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Furthermore, a nighttime search warrant can be
 
justified when a search will not violate the policies underlying
 
the nighttime search prohibition. Id. at 7, 904 P.2d at 892. 
These policies include protection of the greater expectation of
 privacy at night and a heightened safety risk which may arise
 
from forcible nighttime entries. Id. Neither policy was
 
implicated in this case. The affidavit in support of the warrant
 stated the police had already arrested several people and secured
 
the property earlier that same day. The authorization for a
 
nighttime search in this case was justified.
 
C. Trial Proceedings
 
Harris raises several points of error relating to the
 
trial leading to her conviction. Harris contends the circuit
 court erroneously: (1) denied her motion to compel discovery;
 
(2)conducted its proceedings with a tainted jury; (3) denied
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Harris due process; (4) denied a proffered exhibit; (5) denied
 
her the opportunity to raise defenses regarding her mental state;
 
(6) concluded the the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
 
Persons Act (RLUIPA) inapplicable; and (7) imposed cruel and
 
unusual punishment.
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Harris's motion to compel discovery. In her motion,
 
Harris sought to compel production of, among other things, the
 
personnel files of all officers present at the search, the
 
officers' time cards for February 2007, and transcripts of any
 
and all police commission meetings regarding certain officers,
 
contending the information may be relevant to impeaching the
 
officers' credibility. The circuit court concluded the motion
 
was a vague and overly broad "fishing expedition," and the court
 
permitted Harris to file another motion stating more specific
 
reasons supporting disclosure, though Harris did not file another
 
motion. We conclude Harris fails to demonstrate an abuse of
 
discretion.
 
(2) Harris's claim of taint to the jury does not
 
warrant a new trial. The record indicates that before jury
 
selection, an unknown person distributed fliers regarding an
 
unrelated marijuana case to a number of potential jurors, without
 
either of the parties' knowledge or permission. The circuit
 
court identified the potential jurors who had contact with the
 
unknown person, and the court and the parties' attorneys
 
questioned each of the potential jurors about their contact and
 
whether the contact influenced their ability to be fair or
 
impartial. Harris's attorney then agreed to proceed with the
 
trial. The record indicates Harris did not move for a mistrial
 
or to disqualify a juror because of the alleged taint on the
 
jury. "The general rule is that where the juror misconduct is
 
known by a party or his counsel, he cannot await verdict and then
 
complain." Stratis v. Pac. Ins. Co., Ltd., 7 Haw. App. 1, 7, 739
 
P.2d 251, 255 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Harris claims she was denied the Sixth Amendment 
right to confront witnesses because the officer who obtained the 
warrant did not testify at her trial. However, the Confrontation 
Clause applies only to testimonial hearsay, Davis v. Washington, 
547 U.S. 813, 823 (2006); State v. Moore, 82 Hawai fi 202, 223, 
921 P.2d 122, 143 (1996), and Harris has not identified any hearsay from the officer that was admitted at her trial. Our 
independent review of the record indicates no hearsay was 
admitted. 
Harris claims she had the right to cross-examine the
 
officer about his role in obtaining the search warrant and
 
submitting the supporting affidavit. However, neither the
 
warrant nor the affidavit was entered into evidence at trial. At
 
the hearing on Harris's motion to dismiss the counts and suppress
 
evidence, the officer at issue was present in court, and Harris
 
had the opportunity to examine him then. Therefore, the circuit
 
court did not commit plain error by failing to sua sponte order a
 
subpoena for the officer's appearance at the jury trial. 
(4) and (5) The circuit court did not err when it 
excluded Harris's offer of an annotated copy of the Hawai
fi 
Constitution as hearsay. Nor did the circuit court err when it excluded evidence relating to a mistake of law defense pursuant 
to HRS § 702-220 (1993). Mistake of law is an affirmative 
defense "when the defendant acts in reasonable reliance upon an 
official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid 
or erroneous[.]" HRS § 702-220 (emphasis added). At trial, 
Harris sought to introduce an administrative ruling for the 
purpose of raising a mistake of law defense, but she made no 
showing that the ruling was "afterward determined to be invalid 
or erroneous." In fact, she argues the ruling is valid and 
supports one of her arguments. Therefore, the circuit court did 
not err in denying her proffered evidence, nor did it err when it 
denied her request for jury instructions on the mistake of law 
defense and the choice of evils defense under HRS § 703-302 
(1993). See Loevsky v. Carter, 70 Haw. 419, 432, 773 P.2d 1120, 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1128 (1989) (jury instruction should not be given unless there is
 
evidence introduced to support that instruction).
 
(6) The circuit court did not err in concluding RLUIPA
 
is inapplicable to this case. RLUIPA applies to "land use
 
regulation" and to impositions of a "substantial burden on the
 
religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an
 
institution[.]" 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000cc, 2000cc-1.
 
(7) Finally, "[t]here is no question here of cruel and
 
unusual punishment. It was within the prerogative of the
 
legislature to make the decision that possession of marijuana
 
should not be decriminalized. . . . [W]e find no warrant for
 
judicial interference in this case." State v. Baker, 56 Haw.
 
271, 284, 535 P.2d 1394, 1401-02 (1975) (footnote omitted).
