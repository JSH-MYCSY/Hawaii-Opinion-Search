OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DANIEL JOSEPH JOHNSON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 94-189K)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Daniel Joseph Johnson ("Johnson")
 
appeals from (1) the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 
Order Revoking Probation, and (2) the Second Amended Order of
 Resentencing; Revocation of Probation, both filed on November 17,
 2011 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ("Circuit
 Court").
1 Johnson was resentenced to a five year prison term
 
with credit for time served. 
I. Background
 
On November 3, 1994, an indictment was issued charging
 
Johnson, and another defendant, Benjamin Michael Johnson, with
 
(1) promoting a detrimental drug in the third degree, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 712-1249(1), and
 (2) promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, in violation
 of HRS § 712-1243(1) ("Count Two"). On June 26, 1995, Johnson
 pleaded guilty to Count Two.
 
On September 13, 1995, Johnson was granted a deferred 
acceptance of guilty plea ("DAG") and placed on probation for five years. On June 5, 1996, the State of Hawai
'i ("State") 
filed a Motion to Set Aside Deferred Acceptance of Guilty Plea, requesting that the DAG be set aside and that Johnson be

resentenced because, the State alleged, Johnson had violated the
 
terms of his probation. On June 5, 1998, the Circuit Court set
 aside the DAG and entered a Judgment; Guilty Conviction and
 Probation Sentence ("Judgment"). Johnson was resentenced to five
 years of probation. 
On May 16, 2000, the Circuit Court entered an Order of
 
Discharge and Dismissal. The order stated that Johnson was
 granted a deferral of plea, his deferral period ended on March
 30, 2000, and no motion to set aside the deferred acceptance of
 plea had been filed. The Circuit Court ordered that Johnson be
 discharged from supervision of the court and that the charge
 against Johnson be dismissed.
 
Despite that order, over the next nine years, the State
 
filed three motions for revocation of probation and resentencing
 on the grounds that Johnson had violated the terms of his
 probation. Each motion was granted.
2 Several mittimuses were
 
issued and Johnson served time in prison. Over that same period,
 and interspersed between the State's motions for revocation of
 probation, Johnson filed one motion to reduce his sentence and,
 later, another motion to vacate the Circuit Court's order
 revoking his probation. Throughout those years, neither party
 raised the issue of the Order of Discharge and Dismissal, nor did
 they appeal from any of the orders.
 
On September 25, 2009, the issue of the Order of
 
Discharge and Dismissal was finally raised, albeit not to the
 Circuit Court, when Johnson appealed from the September 3, 2009
 Order Granting Motion for Revocation and to Resentence. Johnson
 specified one point of error, asserting that the Circuit Court
 committed plain error when it revoked his probation and
 resentenced him to five years of imprisonment where the record in
 the case contained the Order of Discharge and Dismissal, which

 The last two of the orders granting revocation of probation were
the August 14, 2009 Order of Resentencing; Revocation of Probation, and the
September 3, 2009 Order Granting State's Motion for Revocation of Probation
and to Resentence ("September 3, 2009 Order Granting Motion for Revocation and
to Resentence"). Both orders were based upon the February 27, 2009 Motion for
Revocation of Probation and to Resentence, and Application for Warrant of
Arrest ("February 27, 2009 Motion for Revocation and to Resentence"), and upon
which a hearing was held on June 8, 2009, where witnesses were presented,
exhibits were submitted, and argument was offered.

purportedly terminated the prosecution against Johnson.
 
Despite the pending appeal, on November 18, 2009, the
 
State's Motion to Correct Clerical Mistake on Order Filed May 16,
 
2000 ("Motion to Correct Clerical Mistake") was filed in the
 Circuit Court. The State explained that the Order of Discharge
 and Dismissal had erroneously specified Johnson instead of his
 co-defendant, Benjamin Michael Johnson, and that it was Benjamin
 Michael Johnson who should have been discharged pursuant to his
 own deferred acceptance of plea entered on March 30, 1995. 
On March 30, 2011, this court issued a Summary
 
Disposition Order relating to Johnson's consolidated appeals in
 Cr. Nos. 94-189K and 01-1-00104K. We held that it was plain
 error for the Circuit Court to resentence Johnson in Cr. No. 94­189K because the Order of Discharge and Dismissal was in the
 record. State v. Johnson, Nos. 30044 and 30084, 2011 WL 1144855,
 
*1 (Haw. Ct. App. March 29, 2011) (SDO). Therefore, we vacated
 the Order of Resentencing and Revocation of Probation and
 remanded the case for further proceedings, including resolution
 of the State's Motion to Correct Clerical Mistake. Id. at *3. 
On June 6, 2011, the Circuit Court held a hearing on
 
the Motion to Correct Clerical Mistake. Johnson offered no
 opposition, and the court announced its intention to grant the
 motion. At that same hearing, parties discussed the process by
 which the court would again address the February 27, 2009 Motion
 for Revocation and to Resentence. At Johnson's request, the
 hearing on the motion was continued until October 17, 2011. On
 August 29, 2011, the Circuit Court issued its Order Granting
 State's Motion to Correct Clerical Mistake on Order Filed May 16,
 2000, and set aside the Order of Discharge and Dismissal. 
On September 8, 2011, Johnson filed a motion for
 
discharge from probation, contending that "[i]n May 2000, this
 action was dismissed[,]" and that his probation was the subject
 of revocation proceedings in 2009 "that were vacated by the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals on April 14, 2011[.]" Johnson
 
3
argued that our April 14, 2011  decision had "effectively

nullified all proceedings that occurred in this case after the
 
May 2000 dismissal order." "Hence," according to Johnson, "all
 actions taken subsequent to that order, including the re­sentencings on May 29, 2001, September 9, 2002, and June 15,
 2006, were also nullified by the appellate order." 
On November 17, 2011, the Circuit Court issued a Second
 
Amended Order of Resentencing; Revocation of Probation, which
 sentenced Johnson to incarceration for five years, consecutive to
 his sentence imposed in Cr. No. 01-1-0004K. The Circuit Court
 also issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 Revoking Probation. 
On December 1, 2011, Johnson filed a Notice of Appeal. 
II.	 Points of Error
 
On appeal, Johnson contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred by revoking his probation because (1) the Order of
 Discharge and Dismissal, filed May 16, 2000, made any actions in
 the case after that date a nullity, and (2) Johnson was not
 provided with written notice of the grounds to revoke his
 probation prior to his probation revocation hearing on
 October 17, 2011, in violation of HRS § 706-625(2).
 
III. Standards of Review
 
Resentencing
 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
decision. Factors that indicate a plain and manifest abuse
of discretion are arbitrary or capricious actions by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
contentions. In general, to constitute an abuse it must
appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.

(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
IV.	 Discussion
 
A.	 Johnson's claim that the Circuit Court's actions after
 
May 16, 2000 were a nullity is without merit.
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Irrespective of whether the Circuit Court properly set 
aside the Order of Discharge and Dismissal, the Circuit Court 
lacked jurisdiction to enter the order in the first instance. See State v. Reed, 77 Hawai
'i 72, 83, 881 P.2d 1218, 1229 (1994) 
("The [trial] court was without authority to waive the time requirements set forth in [Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rules] 29(c) and 33 and, therefore, was without jurisdiction to entertain Reed's motions for new trial and judgment of acquittal."), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai
'i 279, 1 P.3d 281 (2000). 
Although Johnson was granted a DAG on September 13,
 
1995, the DAG was subsequently set aside and Johnson was
 resentenced to probation for five years on June 5, 1998 when the
 Judgment was entered. As such, Johnson was now on probation
 pursuant to his conviction, not the DAG. Johnson's conviction
 was final well before the entry of the Order of Discharge and
 Dismissal on May 16, 2000. There is no statute or rule that
 authorizes the Circuit Court to dismiss a charge against a
 defendant after his conviction on such charge is final and
 Johnson identifies no inherent powers that permit it. Thus, the
 Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the Order of Discharge
 and Dismissal, and its actions after May 16, 2000 were not a
 nullity.

B. Johnson's claim that he was not provided written notice

of the grounds to revoke his probation  prior to his
4
 Even if the Order of Discharge and Dismissal were not void,
Johnson did not oppose the Motion to Correct Clerical Error which sought to
set aside the order, nor did he appeal from the Circuit Court's granting of
the Motion to Correct Clerical Error. Thus, the Order of Discharge and
Dismissal was set aside and had no effect upon the proceedings of the case as
it relates to Johnson.
 
5
 The law requires that the defendant be provided notice of the
time, place, and date of any revocation hearing, along with the basis of any
proposed action:
 
§706-625 Revocation, modification of probation
conditions. . . . 
(2) The prosecuting attorney, the defendant's
probation officer, and the defendant shall be notified by
the movant in writing of the time, place, and date of any
such hearing, and of the grounds upon which action under
this section is proposed.
 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
probation revocation hearing on October 17, 2011 is
without merit.
 
This court's Summary Disposition Order neither reversed
 
the Circuit Court's August 14, 2009 Order of Resentencing;
 
Revocation of Probation, nor did it remand the case with
 instructions to do so; rather, we remanded for the Circuit Court
 to conduct any further proceedings consistent with the opinion. 
Therefore, we observe nothing improper about the Circuit Court
 addressing the clerical error contained in the Order of Discharge
 and Dismissal and then essentially rescheduling the resentencing
 hearing previously held on June 8, 2009, without requiring the
 formality of restating the basis for the motion. 
Johnson does not contend that he and his counsel did
 
not receive notice of the date, time, or place of the reconvened
 hearing; and, according to a certificate of service dated
 February 26, 2009, Johnson was served with a copy of the
 underlying motion which specified the grounds for revoking his
 probation. Therefore, Johnson has not demonstrated that the
 State failed to comply with the notice requirement of HRS § 706­625(2).
 
Therefore, the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 
Order Revoking Probation, and the Second Amended Order of
 Resentencing, both filed on November 17, 2011 in the Circuit
 Court of the Third Circuit, are affirmed.
