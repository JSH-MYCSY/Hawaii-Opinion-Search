 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court).  The
 
circuit court entered judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees
 
Alan Arakawa, as Mayor of County of Maui; Office of Economic
 
Development, County of Maui (OED); Department of Planning, County
 
of Maui (DOP); and Lahaina Town Action Committee (LTAC)
 
(collectively, Defendants).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 23, 2011, LTAC and OED submitted a Special
 
Management Area Assessment Application to the DOP, seeking
 
approval for a Halloween event (Event) in Lahaina. 
Because some
 
of the event's activities and temporary structures would be
 within the Lahaina National Historic District, which is a
 
designated Special Management Area (SMA), the DOP was required to
 
conduct an assessment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
Chapter 205A (2001 Repl.), also known as the Coastal Zone
 
Management Act (CZMA).
 
The CZMA imposes stringent permit requirements for
 
"developments" within SMAs. HRS §§ 205A-28, 205A-26 (2001
 
Repl.). With respect to historic resources, the objectives of
 
the coastal zone management program are to "[p]rotect, preserve,
 
and, where desirable, restore those natural and manmade historic
 
and prehistoric resources in the coastal zone management area
 
that are significant in Hawaiian and American history and
 
culture." HRS § 205A-2(b)(2)(A) (2001 Repl.). In implementing
 
these objectives, agencies are required to give "full
 
consideration to ecological, cultural, historic, esthetic,
 
recreational, scenic, and open space values, and coastal hazards,
 
as well as to needs for economic development." HRS § 205A-4(a)
 
(2001 Repl.). The CZMA empowers the county authorities to adopt
 
rules implementing procedures for issuing SMA permits for
 
developments within SMAs. HRS § 205A-29(a) (2001 Repl.).

 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In accordance with statutory mandates, the Maui
 
Planning Commission's Special Management Area Rules (SMA Rule)
 
set out the assessment and determination procedures for issuing
 
SMA permits. SMA Rule § 12-202-12 requires evaluation of the
 
value of the activity, a determination of whether the activity is
 
a "development," and an assessment of any potential adverse
 
environmental and ecological effects. SMA Rule § 12-202­
12(d)(1). Upon reviewing the assessment application from LTAC
 
and OED, the County of Maui's Director of Planning (Planning
 
Director) concluded that the Event required an SMA minor permit.2
 
On August 30, 2011, the Planning Director issued an SMA 
permit for the Event. As required by HRS § 205A-30 (2001 Repl.), 
notice of the permit was transmitted to the State of Hawai' i 
Office of Environmental Quality Control (OEQC) and was published on September 23, 2011 in "The Environmental Notice," the OEQC's 
periodic bulletin. The Planning Director notified the Maui 
Planning Commission (MPC), as required by SMA Rule § 12-202-14, 
and the County Clerk posted an MPC agenda listing the permit 
issuance as an action item. 
The Planning Director assessed the event under HRS
 
Chapter 343 (2010 Repl. and Supp. 2011) because it involved the
 
following "triggers": (1) use of county land or funds
 
(HRS § 343-5(a)(1) (2010 Repl.)); (2) use of land within the
 
shoreline area (HRS § 343-5(a)(3) and HRS § 205A-41 (2001
 
Repl.)); and (3) use of land within any historic site (including
 
the Lahaina National Historic Landmark District). If an action
 
triggers HRS Chapter 343, an environmental assessment (EA) must
 
be conducted unless the proposed activity is declared exempt
 
pursuant to HRS § 343-6 (2010 Repl.). HRS § 343-5(c). 
2
 HRS § 205A-22 (2001 Repl. and Supp. 2011) states an SMA minor
permit may be issued for "an action by the authority authorizing development
the valuation of which is not in excess of $500,000 and which has no
substantial adverse environmental or ecological effect, taking into account
potential cumulative effects."
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 343-6(a)(2) defines exempt actions as those that "will 
probably have minimal or no significant effects on the 
environment," and Hawaii Administrative Rule (HAR) § 11-200-8 
provides a list of exempt classes of action. The exemption list 
for the County of Maui, which has been submitted to and concurred 
with by the State of Hawai' i Environmental Council, tracks the 
HAR's exemption list. The Planning Director determined that the event was exempt from preparation of an EA because it fell under 
the exemption for "construction or placement of minor structures 
accessory to existing facilities." 
The Planning Director also considered whether the
 
Cultural Resources Commission (CRC) had jurisdiction over any
 
part of the planned Event. The CRC's powers, which are
 
established in Maui County Code Chapter 2.88, include approving
 
or disapproving building permit and demolition permit plans and
 
applications for activities that involve vending under the Banyan
 
Tree Park, a county park located within the Lahaina historic
 
district. Maui County Code 2.88.060. The Planning Director
 
determined the Event did not involve any activities within the
 
CRC's approval authority and decided a review by the CRC for the
 
Event was not required.
 
SMA Rule § 12-202-26(a) provides, "[a]ppeal of the
 
director's decision may be made to the commission by the filing
 
of a notice of appeal with the department [of planning] . . . not
 
later than ten days after the meeting at which the commission
 
received notification of the director's decision." No appeal was
 
filed by the deadline.
 
Procedural History
 
On October 21, 2011, Dancil and an organization called
 
3
 Na Makua O'  Maui  (Plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the circuit
court objecting to the Event and seeking judicial review of the 
3
 Na Makua O'  Maui did not file a notice of appeal. 
4
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendants' action. The Plaintiffs asserted counts for "civil 
conspiracy" to circumvent review by the CRC; civil rights 
violations caused by holding the event without CRC review or an 
EA; fraudulent representation; violations of HRS §§ 343, 6E (2009 
Repl.), and 711-1101 (Supp. 2011); and violations of the Equal 
Protection clauses of the Hawai' i Constitution and the United 
States Constitution. The complaint requested injunctive relief, "[c]hange of venue of [the Event] from Lahaina Town 
District . . . to a more appropriate venue[,]" and general and 
punitive damages. 
On October 25, 2011, the Plaintiffs filed an ex parte
 
motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) seeking to stay
 
the Event. The circuit court issued a TRO that same day and held
 
a hearing on the motion on October 27, 2011. At the hearing's
 
conclusion, the circuit court ruled from the bench, dissolving
 
the TRO and dismissing the action.
 
On November 3, 2011, the circuit court entered its
 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order"
 
(FOFCOL) in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs. The
 
circuit court indicated it dismissed the case because "Dancil
 
lacks standing, because a favorable decision is not likely to
 
provide relief for the Plaintiff's alleged injury[]" and because
 
"Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by
 
failing to appeal the Planning Director's decision."
 
The circuit court entered its Final Judgment on
 
December 9, 2011 pursuant to the FOFCOL. Dancil filed his notice
 
of appeal from the FOFCOL on December 2, 2011.
4 On appeal,

 On October 24, 2012, Dancil filed a "Motion For a Stay," which asked
this court to enjoin a scheduled 2012 Halloween event in Lahaina pending this
appeal. Dancil filed his motion only seven days before the scheduled event.Because Dancil failed to provide an adequate basis for his motion, wesummarily denied his motion on October 29, 2012. See Stop Rail Now v. De 
Costa, 120 Hawai' i 238, 243-44, 203 P.3d 658, 663-64 (App. 2008) (requiring
party seeking injunction pending appeal to show: (1) the substantiallikelihood of success on the merits; (2) the balance of irreparable harms

Dancil contends the circuit court erred in dismissing the case
 
and denying injunctive relief.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"Whether the circuit court has jurisdiction to hear the 
plaintiffs' complaint presents a question of law, reviewable de 
novo." Right to Know Comm. v. City Council, City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 117 Hawai' i 1, 7, 175 P.3d 111, 117 (App. 2007) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Mootness
 
The Defendants contend this case is moot because the
 
event at issue occurred on October 31, 2011, and the record is
 
insufficient to allow analysis of future Halloween events. 
However, an exception to the mootness doctrine applies "when the
 
question involved affects the public interest, and it is likely
 
in the nature of things that similar questions arising in the
 
future would likewise become moot before a needed authoritative
 
determination by an appellate court can be made[.]" Kona Old
 
Hawaiian Trails Group v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 87, 734 P.2d 161, 165
 (1987) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). We
 
conclude Dancil's appeal retains vitality because the questions
 
here are of public concern and, in the likely event they recur in
 
the future, are of a nature that would likely become moot before
 
they could be determined on appeal. See Id. at 87-88, P.2d at
 
165-66 (concluding challenge to SMA permit issuance was not moot,
 even if all of the work sanctioned by the permits was finished by
 
the time of appeal).
 
favors issuance of the injunction; and (3) the public interest supports
granting the injunction). On October 30, 2012, Dancil filed a motion for
reconsideration of our order denying his request for an injunction pending
appeal, which we also summarily denied that same day.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B. Primary Jurisdiction
 
The circuit court concluded the Plaintiffs had failed 
to exhaust their administrative remedies by failing to appeal the 
Planning Director's decision to the MPC. The circuit court cited 
Kona Old, 69 Haw. 81, 734 P.2d 161, a case in which the 
plaintiff's noncompliance with available administrative remedies 
resulted in the Hawai' i Supreme Court's affirmance of the trial 
court's dismissal of the case pending agency review. In that case, Kona Old, an association of Kona residents, objected to the 
planning director's issuance of an SMA minor permit. The Hawai' i 
County Charter specifically provided an administrative procedure under which all actions of the planning director were appealable 
to the county Board of Appeals. However, Kona Old did not avail 
itself of this opportunity for an agency hearing and sought 
judicial review from the circuit court of the director's action. 
The supreme court's reasoning explained the related
 
doctrines of exhaustion of administrative remedies and primary
 
jurisdiction. Both are doctrines of comity outlining the
 
relationship between courts and administrative agencies. 
Exhaustion applies where a claim is "cognizable in the first
 
instance by an administrative agency alone[.]" Id. at 93, 734
 
P.2d at 169. On the other hand, "[p]rimary jurisdiction applies
 where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes
 
into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the
 
resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been
 
placed within the special competence of an administrative body." 
Id. at 93, 734 P.2d at 168 (internal quotation marks, ellipsis,
 
and brackets omitted). In such cases, "the judicial process is
 
suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative
 
body for its views." Id. at 93, 734 P.2d at 168 (internal
 
quotation marks omitted).
 
In Pavsek v. Sandvold, 127 Hawai' i 390, 400, 279 P.3d 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
55, 65 (App. 2012), this court read Kona Old as applying the
 
primary jurisdiction doctrine. In Kona Old, the supreme court
 
noted HRS § 205A-6 (2001 Repl.), which creates a private right of
 
action to enforce agency compliance with the CZMA, "seemingly
 
describes a claim 'originally cognizable in the courts,'" and the
 
exhaustion of remedies doctrine does not apply to claims
 
originally cognizable in the courts. Kona Old, 69 Haw. at 93,
 
734 P.2d at 169. The question in this case is whether claims
 Dancil asserts are originally cognizable in the circuit court. 
We conclude that Kona Old controls our disposition, and the
 
doctrine of primary jurisdiction warrants dismissal.
 
All of Dancil's claims are based on the Planning 
Director's decision to issue the August 30, 2011 SMA permit for 
the Event. The Maui County Charter and the SMA rules provide an 
express procedure for appealing the Planning Director's decision 
to issue the permit. We note that in GATRI v. Blane, 88 Hawai' i 
108, 111-12, 962 P.2d 367, 370-71 (1998), the supreme court examined the Maui County Charter and SMA rules and held that 
there was no express procedure for appeal of the Planning 
Director's decision on a minor permit application to the MPC. 
However, the relevant SMA Rules have been amended since GATRI. 
At the time the court decided GATRI, SMA Rule 12-202-14 stated, 
"The [Planning Director] shall approve, approve with conditions, 
or deny [an SMA minor] permit in accordance with the guidelines 
in HRS section 205A-26, as amended. Any final decision shall be 
transmitted to the applicant in writing." Id. at 111, 962 P.2d 
at 370. Based on this language, the supreme court concluded: 
The [MPC] has delegated the authority to render a final
decision on a minor permit application to the [Planning
Director]. The [Planning Director] is required to notify 
the Commission of permits which he has granted. Based on [Hawai'i's Thousand Friends v City and County of Honolulu,
75 Haw 237, 858 P.2d 276 (1993)], we hold that, under thisscheme, the circuit court had jurisdiction over this appealof a final decision of the [Planning Director.] 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 112, 962 P.2d at 371.
 
In contrast, SMA Rule § 12-202-14(b) currently states,
 
"Any final decision shall be transmitted to the applicant in
 
writing and shall be appealable [to the MPC] pursuant to section
 
5
 12-202-26"  (emphasis added).  This addition creates an express
 
procedure for appealing the Planning Director's decisions on an
 
SMA minor permit application to the MPC. 
The record in this case
 
does not indicate that recourse to this procedure would be futile
 or impractical.
 
As in 
Kona Old, this case involves judicial 
intervention in matters that have been placed "within the special 
competence of the [DOP]." Kona Old at 93, 734 P.2d at 169 
(internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai' i State 
Legislature delegated responsibility for administering the CZMA 
and its SMA provisions to the county planning commissions, and 
the County of Maui has specifically delegated "all matters 
relating to the Coastal Zone Management law," including the 
issuance of SMA minor permits, to the MPC. HRS § 205A-22; Maui 
County Charter § 8-8.4. 
Based on the complaint allegations in this case, we
 
conclude Dancil's claim, as in Kona Old, "involves the issuance
 
of a special management area minor permit, and its enforcement
 
requires the resolution of issues which, under the regulatory
 
scheme, have been placed within the special competence of the
 
[DOP]." Kona Old, 69 Haw. at 93, 734 P.2d at 169 (internal
 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). Accordingly, judicial
 intervention in the administrative process should not precede the
 
5
 SMA Rule 12-202-26 states: "Appeal of the director's decision may be
made to the commission by the filing of a notice of appeal with the department
not later than ten days after the receipt of the director's written decision, or,
where the director's decision is not required by the commission or these rules to
be served upon appellant, not later than ten days after the meeting at which the
commission received notification of the director's decision."
 
9
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resolution by the MPC of the question of whether the Planning
 
Director's action in issuing the minor permit was proper. Id. 
The plaintiff in Kona Old invoked HRS § 205A-6, which
 
creates a cause of action for enforcing the CZMA, and claimed the
 
planning director had violated the CZMA, breached the public
 
trust, and disturbed traditional public easement rights by
 
improvidently granting an SMA minor permit. Kona Old, 69 Haw at
 
86, 734 P.2d at 164. Here, although Dancil did not specifically
 allege a violation of the CZMA and did not invoke HRS § 205A-6 as
 
the basis for his entitlement to file suit, the complaint makes
 
clear that similar to the situation in Kona Old, Dancil is
 
challenging the administrative process by which the SMA minor
 
permit was issued. Dancil's allegations include, inter alia,
 
that: (1) the Defendants "circumvent[ed] the [CRC] review
 
process, and obtain[ed] a permit for [the Event], in a deceptive
 
and [sic] manner, in order to avoid such review," (2) "false
 
representations by Defendants have been made in order to
 
accomplish their objective of sponsoring [the Event,]" and (3)
 
"no appropriate review by competent authorities with proper
 
procedural safeguards[] has taken place." In addition, Dancil
 
did explicitly and timely allege the lack of a required
 
environmental assessment that gave the circuit court jurisdiction
 
of that claim under HRS § 343-7.
 
Dancil also asserted violations of rights under the 
Hawai'i Constitution and the United States Constitution. We 
acknowledge that deference to an agency is inappropriate in cases "in which the constitutionality of the agency's rules and 
procedures is challenged and questions are raised as to whether 
the agency has acted within the scope of its authority. The 
agency is not empowered to decide these questions of law." Aged 
Hawaiians v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 78 Hawai' i 192, 202, 891 P.2d 
10
     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
279, 289 (1995). However, "a fundamental and longstanding 
principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid 
reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of 
deciding them." Hawai'i Gov't Emp. Ass'n, AFSCME Local 152 v. 
Lingle, 124 Hawai' i 197, 208, 239 P.3d 1, 12 (2010) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Dancil cannot bypass the agency's 
review process by simply characterizing the issues as a violation 
of constitutional rights. Here, a determination by the MPC that 
the Defendants failed to follow proper procedure for the SMA 
minor permit would avoid the necessity of a constitutional 
determination.6 Therefore, the administrative remedy should be 
pursued first. 
Applying primary jurisdiction "conserves scarce 
judicial resources by allowing an administrative agency with expertise to decide the predicate issues." Jou v. Nat'l 
Interstate Ins. Co. of Hawai' i, 114 Hawai' i 122, 128, 157 P.3d 
561, 567 (App. 2007). The question of whether the Planning 
Director followed the proper procedures in issuing the permit is 
a question that is within the MPC's special competence, and the 
Maui County Charter and SMA Rules provide a process to address 
this type of question. The agency's resolution may reveal that 
there is no basis for Dancil's claim or may satisfy Dancil and 
obviate the need to further pursue his claims. See Id. Even if 
the MPC ultimately upheld the Defendants' actions, the administrative proceedings would produce information relevant and 
useful to judicial review. 
Our concern, as in Kona Old, "is with the timing of the
 
request for judicial relief." Kona Old, 69 Haw. at 93, 734 P.2d 
6
 Dancil's complaint is inartfully crafted containing other claims
that may or may not be cognizable at all; but since we affirm the circuit
court's dismissal of Dancil's complaint, albeit for different reasons, we need
not address every claim.
 
11
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 169. By requiring Dancil to first pursue resolution with the
 
Planning Director and the MPC,
 
[u]niformity and consistency in the regulation of business
entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the
limited functions of review by the judiciary are more
rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining
and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues
to agencies that are better equipped than courts by
specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by
more flexible procedure.
I d .
 
After pursuing the available administrative remedies, 
Dancil would eventually be entitled to judicial review pursuant 
to HRS § 91-14 (1993 and Supp. 2011). The Maui Planning 
Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure § 12-201-32 
provides: "Final decisions of the commission may be appealed 
pursuant to chapter 91, HRS, as amended." Administrative 
agencies have the authority to preliminarily review and determine 
the propriety of its own actions, so long as that determination 
is subject to a "check" by subsequent judicial review. This is 
not a case in which the agency would render a final unreviewable 
determination on the propriety of its own actions under the law. 
See Alakai Na Keiki, Inc. v. Matayoshi, 127 Hawai' i 263, 282, 286 
n 50, 277 P.3d 988, 1007, 1011 n 50 (2012). 
Where the doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies, the
 
court has the "discretion either to retain jurisdiction [and stay
 the proceedings] or, if the parties would not be unfairly
 
disadvantaged, to dismiss the case without prejudice." Reiter v.
 
Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 268–69, 113 S.Ct. 1213, 1220 (U.S.N.C.
 1993). Nothing in the record suggests the circuit court abused
 
its discretion in choosing to refrain from exercising
 
jurisdiction, and therefore we affirm the circuit court's
 
dismissal.
