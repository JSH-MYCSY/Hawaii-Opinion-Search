(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Appellant United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646,
 
AFL-CIO ("UPW") appeals from the November 25, 2011 Order Granting
 
Employer's Motion to Confirm Arbitrator Thomas E. Crowley's
 Arbitration Decision and Award Dated November 15, 2010, Filed on

I. Background
 
On May 14, 2009, UPW submitted a grievance on behalf of
 
Richard Condon ("Condon"), challenging whether Condon had been
 discharged by Appellee State of Hawaii, Department of Human
 Services, Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility ("DHS") for just and
 proper cause based on the allegations that he had used excessive
 force against two wards while he was a youth corrections officer

at the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility. On May 26, 2009, UPW
 
submitted a separate grievance contending that DHS failed to
 respond in a timely manner to UPW's information requests. DHS
 denied both grievances. 
An arbitration hearing was held on the grievances. The
 
Arbitration Decision and Award dated November 12, 2010
 ("Decision") held in favor of DHS, dismissed the grievances, and
 sustained Condon's termination. On September 20, 2011, DHS
 initiated proceedings in the Circuit Court by filing a motion to
 confirm Arbitrator Thomas E. Crowley's Decision ("Motion to
 Confirm"). The Motion to Confirm asked the court for an order
 confirming the Decision pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
2 3 
("HRS") § 658A-22  and for a judgment pursuant to HRS § 658A-25. 
On October 26, 2011, UPW filed a special appearance to 
oppose the Motion to Confirm ("Special Appearance"). 
UPW argued 
that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction due to improper service of process because the Motion to Confirm had not been served "in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action[.]" See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-5(b) 
(Supp. 2011). UPW presented evidence that it had not been served in accordance with either Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
4
("HRCP") Rule 4  or Rules of the Circuit Court of the State of
2 HRS § 658A-22 states:
 
Confirmation of Award. After a party to an
arbitration proceeding receives notice of an award, the
party may make a motion to the court for an order confirming
the award at which time the court shall issue a confirming
order unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to
section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to section
658A-23.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-22 (Supp. 2013).
 
3 HRS § 658A-25(a) states, in part: "Upon granting an order
confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting
an award, the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith. . . ."

(c) Same: By Whom Served. Service of all process shall
be made: (1) anywhere in the State by the sheriff or the

county by the chief of police or the chief's duly authorized
subordinate. A subpoena, however, may be served as provided
in Rule 45.
 
(d) Same: Personal Service. The summons and complaint
shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the
person making service with such copies as are necessary.
Service shall be made as follows:

and of the complaint to the individual personally or in case
the individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof at
the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with
some person of suitable age and discretion then residing
therein or (B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of
the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by
law to receive service of process.
 
. . . .
 
(3) Upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a
partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to suit under a common name, by delivering a copy of
the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing
or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by
appointment or by law to receive service of process and, if
the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service
and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the
defendant.
 
. . . .
 
(8) Upon a defendant of any class referred to in
paragraph (1) or (3) of this subdivision of this rule, it is
also sufficient if the summons and complaint are served in
the manner prescribed by any statute.

In response, DHS argued that UPW had "waived any
 
objection to service via motion by accepting service via motion
 
in a case involving the same parties and the same grievant[,]"
 referring to a motion to confirm filed in a separate case in
 2009. 
At a hearing held on November 2, 2011, the Circuit
 
Court held that under HRS chapter 658, a party moving to confirm
 an arbitration award was not required to serve notice of such a
 motion via a summons. The Circuit Court stated: 
the Court will treat this in terms of the regular
practice that had transpired under chapter 658 in
 terms of filing a motion to confirm an arbitration
award. And in looking at some of the comments
that underlie or underpin the Uniform Arbitration
Act, it was not meant to supersede the practice
that had been done previously.
 
(Emphasis added.) The Circuit Court granted the Motion to
 
Confirm and entered judgment in DHS's favor. 
II. Points of Error
 
On appeal, UPW argues that the Circuit Court erred by
 
(1) applying provisions from a repealed statute, HRS chapter 658,
 
rather than a statute still in effect, HRS chapter 658A; (2)
 disregarding the plain and unambiguous language of HRS § 658A­5(b); (3) failing to require compliance with HRCP Rule 4 and RCCH
 Rule 5; and (4) granting the Motion to Confirm without personal
 jurisdiction over UPW or Condon. 
III. Standard of Review
 
Statutory Interpretation

reviewable de novo.'" Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 128 Hawai

First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its
 plain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task
of statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
 legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
 indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists.

of the City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 114 Hawai 'i 184, 193, 159 P.3d

IV.
	 Discussion
 
A.	 The Circuit Court erred in failing to enforce the
requirements for service of "an initial motion" under
HRS § 658A-5(b).
 
We agree with UPW that the Circuit Court clearly erred
 
in not applying the plain language of HRS § 658A-5(b). 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. We must read
 
statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. When
 there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute an
ambiguity exists. . . .
 
Kanahele v. Maui Cnty. Council, 130 Hawai 'i 228, 244, 307 P.3d 
1174, 1190 (2013) (emphasis removed) (quoting Franks v. City &
 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 74 Haw. 328, 334-35, 843 P.2d 668, 671-72
 (1993)). "If we determine, based on the foregoing rules of
 statutory construction, that the legislature has unambiguously
 spoken on the matter in question, then our inquiry ends." Id.
 
(quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai
'i 97, 144, 
9 P.3d 409, 456 (2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
Service requirements under HRS § 658A-5, entitled
 
"Application for judicial relief," are unambiguous. The statute
 states, in relevant part:
 
(b) Unless a civil action involving the agreement to
arbitrate is pending, notice of an initial motion to the
 
5
     
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
court under this chapter shall be served in the manner
 
provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil
 action. Otherwise, notice of the motion shall be given in
the manner provided by law or rule of court for serving
motions in pending cases.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 658A-5(b) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added). That
 
is, if a civil case involving an agreement to arbitrate is
 
already pending — for instance, if the circuit court granted an
 earlier motion to compel arbitration and stayed proceedings — a
 notice of motion shall be served as other motions in pending
 cases. If, however, a motion brought under Chapter 658A
 initiates a civil case — functioning like a complaint — then it
 must be personally served. Id.; see Haw. R. Civ. P. 4. 
Here, the Motion to Confirm initiated the civil case
 
docketed as S.P. No. 11-1-0549. The Motion to Confirm sought
 relief under HRS §§ 658A-22 and 658A-25. Thus, notice of this
 initiating motion was required to be served "in the manner
 provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action." 
See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-5(b); Asset Acceptance, LLC v. Johnson,
 
268 P.3d 551, 555–56 (Okla. Civ. App. 2011) (treating petition
 for confirmation of arbitration award as an application for
 judicial review under analogous statute).
 
The Circuit Court did not rely on § 658A-5(b), but
 
instead treated this case "in terms of the regular practice that
 had transpired under chapter 658[.]"
6 The Circuit Court erred in
 
doing so. Chapter 658 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes was
 repealed in 2001. 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265, § 5 at 820. 
6 Although UPW does not make the point itself, we note that the
Circuit Court looked at "certain comments" in the Revised Uniform Arbitration
 
Act ("RUAA") in deciding to handle service of process "in terms of the regular
practice" under HRS chapter 658. The Circuit Court apparently perceived the
filing of a complaint summons and the filing of a motion as the forms of
"practice" referred to in the commentary, and concluded that HRS § 658A-5 was
"not meant to supersede the practice that had been done previously." 
The state legislature adopted the RUAA when drafting HRS § 658A in
2001. See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 115, in 2001 House Journal, at 1093–94, 2001
Senate Journal, at 905. HRS § 658A-5 was derived from section 5 of the RUAA
("Section 5"). The commentary to Section 5 reads that the section "is not
intended to alter established practice in any particular State"; however, the
remainder of the commentary makes clear that the "practice" in question is
whether a motion, or a "petition or [] complaint", is utilized to initiate
arbitration actions. U
NIF. ARBITRATION ACT (2000) § 5 cmt. 2, 7:1A U.L.A. 23
(2009). The commentary does not suggest that the service requirement does not
apply to whichever form is chosen.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"In the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary, 
repeal means the statute or statutory provision no longer exists." Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor & 
Indus. Relations, Unemployment Ins. Div., 70 Haw. 72, 83, 762 P.2d 796, 802 (1988). Here, Chapter 658A was enacted to replace Chapter 658. 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265, §§ 1, 5 at 810-19, 820; Trs. of Don Ho Revocable Living Trust v. Demattos, 126 Hawai
'i 179, 180, 268 P.3d 432, 433 (App. 2011) ("because HRS 
Chapter 658 was repealed and replaced by HRS Chapter 658A, we apply the statutory authority applicable to appeals under HRS Chapter 658A"). Thus, the procedures found in the long-replaced Chapter 658 cannot supersede the plain language of a statute found in Chapter 658A, which remains in effect. 
HRCP Rule 4 and RCCH Rule 5 provide how a summons is to
 
be served. Pursuant to HRS § 658A-5(b), these rules also govern
 how notice of the Motion to Confirm was to be served.
 
DHS does not dispute that it failed to comply with 
these rules but instead argues that UPW waived any objection to service in this case by accepting the same method of service in a previous case. Waiver, however, is "an intentional relinquishment of a known right, a voluntary relinquishment of rights, and the relinquishment or refusal to use a right." Daiichi Hawai
'i Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai 'i 325, 346 
n.17, 82 P.3d 411, 432 n.17 (2003) (citing Ass'n of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton & Walberg Co., 68 Haw. 98, 108, 705 P.2d 28, 36 (1985)). "To constitute a waiver, there must have existed a right claimed to have been waived and the waiving party must have had knowledge, actual or constructive, of the existence of such a right at the time of the purported waiver." Id., (citing 
Honolulu Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Pao, 4 Haw. App. 478, 484, 668 P.2d 50, 54 (1983)). DHS presents no authority in support of its theory that a party's failure to object to the sufficiency of process in one prior case constitutes a waiver of its right to legally sufficient service of process in subsequent cases. Thus, we hold that the argument is without merit, and that DHS failed to properly serve notice of the Motion to Confirm as 
7

required by law.7
 
B.	 The Circuit Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the
Appellee.
 
UPW was not properly served with notice of the Motion
 
to Confirm as required by HRCP Rule 4. Thus, the Circuit Court
 
lacked personal jurisdiction over UPW.
 
"A judgment rendered in the absence of personal
 
jurisdiction is void and must be set aside." Id. at 413, 922
 
P.2d at 1026 (quoting McGuire v. Sigma Coatings, Inc., 48 F.3d
 902, 907 (5th Cir. 1995)). Because the Circuit Court issued the
 Judgment against UPW without personal jurisdiction over UPW, the
 Judgment is void.
