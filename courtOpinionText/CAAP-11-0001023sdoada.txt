LISA MARIE BARROS; CORY BARROS; LINDSAY PUNA;

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In an appeal arising from an action for summary
 
possession and ejectment, Defendant-Appellant Travis Kaimana
 
1
Barros (Barros),  appearing pro se, appeals from the Judgment for
 
Possession in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Federal National
 
Mortgage Association, which was filed on November 3, 2011, in the
 Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).
2 We affirm.
 
On appeal, Barros contends that the Circuit Court
 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case because he has
 demonstrated the continuing existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom. 
Our appellate courts, however, have repeatedly held that claims

notice of appeal.

of this nature are without merit. In State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai'i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013), the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
reaffirmed this view where it stated: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from
the court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of
the Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm
that "[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness"
of its origins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now, a
lawful government." 
State v. Fergerstrom , 106 Hawai' i 
43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106
Hawai'i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). Individuals claiming
to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are
not exempt from application of the State's laws. See
 
id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77
Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State v.
French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182
(App. 1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d
444 (1999).
 
Thus we also reject Kaulia's argument that the
circuit court erred in precluding Kaulia from calling
a witness to present evidence concerning the existence
of the Kingdom in support of his Motion to Dismiss.
 
Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i at 487, 291 P.3d at 385 (brackets and 
ellipsis points in original).
 
Accordingly, the November 3, 2011, Judgment for
 
Possession is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 25, 2013.
