In the Matter of the Estate of DALE KANANI TIM SING, Deceased
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(PROBATE NO. 05-1-307)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Respondent-Appellant 
Marlene Tim Sing (Appellant Marlene Sing) has asserted from the Honorable Glenn S. Hara's November 3, 2011 "Order Granting 
Petition for Removal of Personal Representative for Cause and 
Appointment of Successor Personal Representative" (the November 3, 2011 interlocutory order) because the November 3, 2011 interlocutory order is not independently appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) and Rule 34 of the Hawai
» i Probate Rules (HPR). 
HRS § 641-1(a) is the law that authorizes appeals from
 
a probate court's final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by
 
the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of
 Hawai» i has promulgated HPR Rule 34, which generally requires the 
entry of a judgment for an appeal:
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
 
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see ,
 
e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 
P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the
 
timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with
 
the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Michie's Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
Annotated Court Rules, HPR Rule 34 cmt. (Michie 2010). Under the
 
holding in Jenkins , "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after
 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has
 been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
 
-2­ 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai» i 115, 119, 869 
P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. Furthermore, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced 
to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 
120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). Therefore, under HRS § 641-1 and HPR Rule 34, a probate court order is eligible for 
appellate review only if the probate court either 
(a)	 reduces the order to a separate and final judgment
pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a),
 
(b)	 certifies the order for appeal in the manner provided byRule 54(b) of the Hawai
»i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)
pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a), or 
(c)	 certifies the order for appeal in accordance with HRS
§ 641-1(b) pursuant to HPR Rule 34(b).
 
On December 23, 2011, the record on appeal for appellate court
 
case number CAAP-11-0001025 was filed, at which time the record
 on appeal did not  contain a separate and final judgment, as HPR
 
Rule 34(a) requires for an appeal. The probate court has not
 
certified the November 3, 2011 interlocutory order in the manner
 
provided by HRCP Rule 54(b). The probate court has not certified
 
the November 3, 2011 interlocutory order for an interlocutory
 
appeal in accordance with HRS § 641-1(b). Therefore, the
 
November 3, 2011 interlocutory order is not eligible for
 appellate review pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34.
 
Although common law exceptions to the final judgment
 
requirement exist under the Forgay  doctrine, Forgay v. Conrad, 47
 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
U.S. 201 (1848), and the collateral order doctrine, the November 
3, 2011 interlocutory order does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the 
collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai» i 18, 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai» i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). 
Absent an appealable judgment or an appealable order
 
that satisfies the requirements for an appeal under HRS § 641­
1(a) and HPR Rule 34, this appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0001025
 
is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
