v.
KALEO P. GOO-VIDINHA, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 1P109-10233)
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Kaleo Goo-Vidinha (Goo-Vidinha)
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment And/Or Order entered
October 25, 2011 by the District Court of the First Circuit,
Honolulu Division1 (district court).  The district court found
Goo-Vidinha guilty of assault in the third degree, in violation
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-712(1)(a)2 and sentenced
him to five days in jail.
On appeal Goo-Vidinha contends the district court erred
when it:
(1) denied his Motion to Withdraw Waiver of Jury Trial;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) abused its discretion in denying his Motion to
 
Compel Discovery of complaining witness's juvenile records; and
 
(3) convicted him despite the lack of substantial
 
evidence to refute his justification of self-defense.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 28, 2009, the complaining witness and Goo­
Vidinha's girlfriend were involved in a verbal altercation at
 
Campbell High School. Goo-Vidinha's girlfriend sent Goo-Vidinha
 
a text message asking him to come to the school. The girlfriend
 
testified that while waiting for Goo-Vidinha to arrive, the
 
complaining witness was cutting her own wrist with a razor blade. 
Goo-Vidinha, aware of past issues between his girlfriend and the
 
complaining witness, rushed to the school.
 
According to the complaining witness, when Goo-Vidinha
 
arrived at the scene, she proceeded to leave. The complaining
 
witness testified that she heard a male voice yell obscenities at
 
her as she was walking away. Complaining witness testified Goo-
Vidinha grabbed her neck, turned her around, and choked her for a
 
few seconds before flinging her to the ground. A teacher
 
testified that she saw Goo-Vidinha throw the complaining witness
 
to the ground.
 
Goo-Vidinha and his girlfriend testified that upon Goo­
Vidinha's arrival, the complaining witness and his girlfriend
 
were engaged in a verbal altercation. According to the
 
girlfriend, the complaining witness began yelling threatening
 
obscenities. Goo-Vidinha testified the complaining witness began
 
walking towards Goo-Vidinha and his girlfriend. According to
 
Goo-Vidinha, the complaining witness approached him and he
 
grabbed the pressure points of her neck to keep her away from his
 
girlfriend. After he grabbed her neck, Goo-Vidinha said the
 
complaining witness fell to the ground.
 
A teacher brought the complaining witness into her
 
classroom and tended to her bleeding wrist.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Validity of waiver
 
The validity of a criminal defendant's waiver of his
or her right to a jury trial presents a question of state
and federal constitutional law. Questions of constitutional
 
law are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard,
with the appellate court exercising its own independent
constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.
 
State v. Myers, 108 Hawai' i 300, 303, 119 P.3d 608, 611 (App. 
2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted) 
(citing to State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai' i 63, 67, 996 P.2d 268, 
272 (2000)). 
The validity of a defendant's waiver of the right to a 
jury trial is reviewed "under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the case, taking into account the defendant's 
background, experience, and conduct." Friedman, 93 Hawai' i at 
70, 996 P.2d at 275. 
B. Substantial evidence in a jury-waived trial
 
Substantial evidence as to every material element of 
the offense charged is "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable 
caution to support a conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial 
judge is free to make all reasonable and rational inferences 
under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence." 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 61 (1996) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai' i 262, 265, 
892 P.2d 455, 458 (1995)). Also, "[i]t is evidence which a 
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a 
conclusion." State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 565, 617 P.2d 820, 
823 (1980). Further, in reviewing whether substantial evidence exists to support a conviction, due deference must be given to 
the right of the trier of fact to "determine credibility, weigh 
the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact from the 
evidence adduced." Id. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that 
"[t]he mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
conduct, and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." 
Eastman, 81 Hawai' i at 141, 913 P.2d at 67. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.
 At a hearing held November 10, 2009, Goo-Vidinha
 
orally waived his right to a jury trial and presented a signed
 
waiver of this right. The district court conducted a colloquy on
 
the record as follows:
 
[Goo-Vidinha's Counsel]: Mr. Goo-Vidinha is present in
court with counsel. And may I approach with the waiver
form, Your Honor.
 
The Court: Okay.
 
[Goo-Vidinha's Counsel]: Waiving jury trial, ask the
matter be set for trial.
 
The Court: okay. Mr. Goo-Vidinha, how old are you?
 
[Goo-Vidinha]: 18.
 
The Court: You're a high school graduate?
 [Goo-Vidinha]: No.
 The Court: In the past 24 hours, have you taken any
alcohol, medication, or drugs?
 
[Goo-Vidinha]: No.
 
The Court: Is your mind clear today?
 
[Goo-Vidinha]: Yes, Your Honor.
 
The Court: You understand –- let me tell you what a
jury trial is. 
Jury trial is where 12 people from the
community determine whether you're guilty or not guilty.
Before you can be found guilty, all 12 would have to agree
beyond a reasonable doubt that you're guilty. You and your
attorney would have a right to help select those 12 people.
If you waive your right to a jury trial, only a judge would
decide your case. You understand that?
 
[Goo-Vidinha]: Yes. 
The Court: And you read the form?
 [Goo-Vidinha]: Yes.
 The Court: You understand it?
 [Goo-Vidinha]: Yes. 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Court: You've gone over this with your attorney?
 
[Goo-Vidinha]: (No audible response.)
 The Court: Is this your signature?
 [Goo-Vidinha]: Yes.
 The Court: Are you voluntarily waiving your right to
jury trial?
 
[Goo-Vidinha]: Yes.
 The Court: Okay. Court finds knowing, voluntary,
intelligent waiver to jury trial. Waiver form acknowledged
with the Court. Set this for trial.
 
On June 21, 2011, Goo-Vidinha filed a Motion to
 
Withdraw Waiver of Jury Trial. On June 23, 2011, the district
 
court heard and denied Goo-Vidinha's Motion to Withdraw Waiver of
 
Jury Trial. Goo-Vidinha contends the district court abused its
 
discretion in denying his Motion to Withdraw Waiver of Jury Trial
 
because he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to
 
a jury trial.
 
A defendant may relinquish his right to a jury trial 
through a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver. Friedman, 
93 Hawai' i at 68, 996 at 273. In order to ensure the validity of 
such a waiver, a court must conduct a colloquy on the record 
advising the defendant of his rights. Id. "The failure to 
obtain a valid waiver of this fundamental right constitutes reversible error." Friedman, 93 Hawai' i at 68, 996 P.2d at 273 
(citing State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. 118, 120, 857 P.2d 576, 577 (1993)). 
In considering the validity of a jury trial waiver 
under the totality of the circumstances, a salient factor is 
whether the defendant has demonstrated a "special disadvantage or 
disability" in the record that indicates he required a more 
extensive colloquy to ensure understanding. State v. Myers, 108 
Hawai'i 300, 304, 119 P.3d 608, 612 (App. 2005) (citing United 
States v. Duarte-Higareda, 113 F.3d 1000 (9th Cir. 1997) (not 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
speaking English as a salient fact of disadvantage or 
disability); See also, United States v. Christensen, 18 F.3d 822, 
825 (9th Cir. 1994) (mental illness as a salient fact of 
disadvantage or disability). The defendant bears the burden of 
showing the waiver was involuntary by a preponderance of 
evidence. Friedman, 93 Hawai' i at 69, 996 P.2d at 274. A court 
ascertains the validity of the waiver by "taking into account the defendant's background, experience, and conduct." Id. at 70, 996 
P.2d at 275. 
Goo-Vidinha contends that his lack of education and
 
inadequate advisement from counsel are salient facts indicating
 he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right during the
 
November 10, 2009 colloquy. The district court asked whether
 
Goo-Vidinha graduated from high school, yet when Goo-Vidinha
 
answered "no," the district court inquired no further. Further
 
inquiry would have disclosed that Goo-Vidinha had only an eighth
 
grade education. His lack of education may have necessitated a
 
more extensive colloquy to ensure the validity of the waiver. 
See Christensen, 18 F.3d 822, 825-26 (9th Cir. 1994). 
In Friedman, the waiver was deemed knowing, intelligent 
and voluntary where the defendant articulated his understanding 
of the right to a jury trial and "did not simply acknowledge his 
right to a jury trial with a simple 'yes'." Friedman, 93 Hawai' i 
at 70, 996 P.2d at 275. In the instant case, Goo-Vidinha did not articulate any understanding, but simply assented to the district 
court's inquiries. This simple assent, given his lack of 
education, raises doubts about what Goo-Vidinha understood about 
his right to a jury trial. 
The record is silent as to any advisements Goo-Vidinha
 
received from his counsel at the time of the waiver. Goo-Vidinha
 
had changed counsel numerous times throughout the litigation and
 
did not recall receiving any advisement on the waiver of a jury
 
trial. In Friedman, defendant's counsel expressly confirmed that
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
he explained the consequences of the waiver to the defendant. 
See Friedman, 93 Hawai' i at 70, 996 P.2d at 275; State v. Myers, 
108 Hawai' i 300, 119 P.3d 608 (App. 2005) (valid waiver where 
defendant received multiple advisements on the record about 
waiving the right to jury trial); State v. Barros, 105 Hawai' i 
160, 169, 95 P.3d 14, 23 (App. 2004) (the court referred Barros to counsel and counsel acknowledged discussing the waiver); State 
v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 312, 322, 55 P.3d 276, 286 (2002) 
(valid waiver where capable counsel confirmed discussion with Sprattling on the issue of waiver). In this case, not only did 
counsel not expressly confirm any advisement, but during the 
colloquy when the district court asked Goo-Vidinha if he 
discussed the waiver with counsel, there was no audible response. 
While no factor is singularly conclusive, when reviewed
 
cumulatively the facts support a contention that the lack of
 
education and absence in the record of any counsel advisement are
 
salient facts that show Goo-Vidinha required a more extensive
 
colloquy for him to knowingly and intelligently relinquish this
 
right. See United States v. Fuller, 941 F.2d 993 (9th Cir. 1991)
 
(sixth grade education, limited English proficiency, lack of
 counsel advisement, and lack of experience in legal system as
 
salient facts of disadvantage or disability). 
B.
 
Goo-Vidinha contends the Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i (State) failed to adduce substantial evidence to refute 
his justification of self defense and defense of others. He specifically challenges the State's reliance on the complaining 
witness's testimony and maintains that such testimony is not 
credible evidence to support a conviction. The district court 
found the complaining witness was walking away when Goo-Vidinha 
placed his hands on her neck. 
A conviction stands so long as there is substantial
 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. State

v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). The district court, acting as trier of fact, determines 
the credibility of witnesses and the weight of evidence adduced 
at trial. State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 
(1996). Though Goo-Vidinha maintains the complaining witness's testimony was not credible, an appellate court will not disturb 
the district court's assessment of credibility. See Eastman, 81 
Hawai'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996). Therefore, the 
district court did not err in finding substantial evidence to 
support Goo-Vidinha's conviction. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Notice of Entry of Judgment And/Or Order entered
 
October 25, 2011, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
Honolulu Division, is vacated and this case is remanded. Because
 
we vacate and remand, we decline to address Goo-Vidinha's
 
remaining points on appeal as moot.
