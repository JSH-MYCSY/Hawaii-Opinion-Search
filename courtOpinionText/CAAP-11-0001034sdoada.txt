SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Intervenor-
Appellant Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D. (Dr. Jou) appeals from a
 
November 29, 2011 Decision and Order (D&O) by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) dismissing Dr. Jou's
 
appeal from a decision by the Department of Labor and Industrial
 
Relations (DLIR) regarding Dr. Jou's request for his fees as a

medical service provider for Claimant-Appellee Francisco Alvarez (Alvarez).
 
Alvarez worked as an employee for Kyo-Ya, Inc. dba
 
Sheraton Waikiki Hotel (Sheraton). Sheraton obtained workers'
 
compensation insurance from Insurance Providers-Appellees First
 
Insurance Company of Hawaii, Ltd. (First Insurance), and
 
Adjusting Services of Hawaii, Inc. Alvarez suffered an injury in
 
the course of employment. Dr. Jou provided medical services for
 
Alvarez's injury. A dispute arose between Sheraton, First
 
Insurance and Dr. Jou regarding Dr. Jou's requested fees for his
 
medical services. The parties submitted this dispute to the DLIR
 
for resolution.
 
On November 5, 1998, the DLIR issued a decision
 
regarding which fees Dr. Jou could and could not recover.
 
On March 23, 2009, Dr. Jou appealed from the DLIR's
 
November 5, 1998 decision to the LIRAB.
 
On November 29, 2011, the LIRAB issued the D&O that
 
dismissed Dr. Jou's appeal as untimely. The LIRAB mailed this
 
D&O to the parties on the same day the D&O was issued.
 
On December 9, 2011, Dr. Jou filed a notice of appeal
 
from the LIRAB's D&O.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Jou's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 386-87(a),
 
Dr. Jou had twenty days after a copy of the DLIR's November 5,
 
1998 decision was sent to him to appeal therefrom to LIRAB. 
Kissell v. Labor and Indus. Relations Appeals Bd., 57 Haw. 37,
 
549 P.2d 470 (1976). Dr. Jou did not appeal the DLIR decision
 
until March 23, 2009.
 
This case is distinguishable from Jou v. Hamada, 120 
Hawai'i 101, 201 P.3d 614 (Haw. App. 2009), in which Dr. Jou 
filed a timely appeal to the circuit court pursuant to

HRS ยง 91-14 seeking a judicial declaration that the no-appeal
 
provision of Hawaii Administrative Rules ยง 12-15-94(d) was
 
invalid. There was no such appeal in this case.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 29, 2011
 
Decision and Order of the Labor and Industrial Appeals Board is
 affirmed.
