ANTHONY W. LUI, Claimant-Appellee,
v.
 
WAIKIKI BUSINESS PLAZA, Employer-Appellee,
and
 
LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,

vs.
 
EMERSON M.F. JOU, M.D., Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-312 (2-99-13848))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Appellant Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D. (Dr. Jou) appeals from
 
the Decision and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial
 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) on November 29, 2011. In its
 Decision and Order, the LIRAB dismissed Dr. Jou's appeal from the
 October 10, 2000, decision of the Director of the Department of
 Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) as untimely. We affirm
 the LIRAB's Decision and Order.
 
I.
 
On October 10, 2000, the Director issued a decision in
 
a cost review billing dispute between Dr. Jou and
 Employer/Insurance Carrier Waikiki Business Plaza/Liberty Mutual
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Insurance Company over services provided by Dr. Jou to a workers'
 
compensation claimant. On that same date, a copy of the
 Director's decision was sent to the parties. Over eight years
 later, Dr. Jou, on March 23, 2009, appealed the Director's
 October 10, 2000, decision to the LIRAB. On November 11, 2011,
 the LIRAB dismissed the appeal, concluding that it was untimely
 filed. 
II.
 
On appeal, Dr. Jou contends that the LIRAB erred by:
 
(1) dismissing his appeal and refusing to apply Jou v. Hamada, 120 Hawai
'i 101, 201 P.3d 614 (2009) retroactively; and (2) 
refusing to grant his motion to consolidate. 
We resolve Jou's arguments as follows:
 (1) The LIRAB did not err in dismissing Dr. Jou's
 
appeal as untimely. Under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386­87(a) (1993), Dr. Jou had twenty days after the copy of the
 Director's decision was sent to the parties on October 10, 2000,
 to appeal the Director's decision to the LIRAB. Dr. Jou did not
 appeal the Director's decision until March 23, 2009.
 
Dr. Jou's appeal to this court does not turn on whether 
Jou v. Hamada should be applied retroactively, but on whether Dr. Jou timely filed a notice of appeal from the Director's decision with the LIRAB. Dr. Jou could have judicially challenged the no-appeal provision of Hawai
'i Administrative Rules § 12-15-94(d) by 
filing an action for declaratory relief to invalidate the provision, as he did in Jou v. Hamada, or by timely appealing the Director's decision to the LIRAB and then seeking judicial review of any decision of the LIRAB dismissing the appeal. See Martin 
v. Green Magic, Inc., No. 29234 2009 WL 1090370 (Hawai
'i App. 
Apr. 23, 2009). Jou v. Hamada is distinguishable and does not 
support Dr. Jou's claim that the LIRAB erred in dismissing his appeal. Alverez v. Kyo-Ya, Inc., No. CAAP-11-0001034, 2012 WL 
5288759, at *1 (Hawai
'i App. Oct. 25, 2012), cert. denied, No. 
SCWC-11-0001034, 2013 WL 214844 (Hawai 'i Jan. 18, 2013).

(2) Because we conclude that the LIRAB did not err in
 
dismissing Dr. Jou's appeal as untimely, we do not address his
 
argument that the LIRAB erred in refusing to grant his motion to
 consolidate.
 
III. 
We affirm the LIRAB's Decision and Order.  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 13, 2014.
