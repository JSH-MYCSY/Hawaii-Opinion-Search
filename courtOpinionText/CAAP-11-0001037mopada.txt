Defendant-Appellant GVG (Father) appeals from the
 
"Order Granting Defendant [MSH's (Mother)] Motion For Relief
 
After Order Or Decree Filed September 27, 2010" entered in the
 
1
Family Court of the First Circuit  (family court) on November 10,
2011. 
The family court adjudicated the issue of child support
 
arrearage due by Father to Mother from January 2005 to September
 2009 and ordered Father to pay $
47,650.00.
 
I. Points On Appeal
 
On appeal Father contends the family court erred when
 
it (1) ordered Father to pay arrearage in the amount of
 
1
 The Honorable Na' unanikina' u A. Kamali' i presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
$47,650.00 to Mother; and (2) clearly erred in Findings of Fact
 
(FOFs) 33, 49-55 & 63-69.
 
Father challenges the following FOFs: 
33. The Court found credible Mother's testimony that Mother
and [Father] had sexual relations and conceived the subject
minor child in Manila, Philippines.
 
. . . .
 
49. Father's gross income for purposes of calculating child
support was based on the Child Support Guidelines for the
period from 2005 through 2009 which is sum of income from
all sources that were regular and consistent, including but
not limited to employment salaries and wages, military base
and special pay and allowances, such as basic allowance for
housing (BAH), basic allowance for subsistence (BAS),
hazardous duty pay, cost-of-living allowance (COLA),
selective reenlistment bonus (SRB), retired/retainer pay,
and reserve pay was higher than the amount reported as total
income on each of his tax returns for that period.
 
50. Evidence was introduced at trial that for the year
2005, Father's monthly gross income was $6,579 or the sum of
his gross monthly: 1) base pay ($
39,302.70 divided by 12 =
$3,275.23) plus 2) Second job ($20,000 divided by 12 =
$1,666.67 plus 3) BAH at $1376 and 4) BAS at $260.82. 
51. [Father] testified at trial that he had no reason to
believe that [Mother's] evidence of his BAS and BAH was
incorrect.
 
52. Evidence was introduced at trial that for the year
2006, Father's monthly gross income was $11,675.59 or the
sum of his gross monthly 1) base pay & 2nd job ($120,184
divided by 12 = $10,015) plus 2) BAH at $1,388 and 3) BAS
$272.26.
 
53. Evidence was introduced at trial that for the year
2007, Father's monthly gross income was $4884.63 or the sum

$3,153.75) plus 2) BAH at $1451 and 3) BAS at $279.88.
 
54. Evidence was introduced at trial that for the year
2008, Fathers monthly gross income is $5849.11 or the sum of
his gross monthly 1) base pay ($39,224.19 divided by 12 =
$3,268.68[)] plus 2) BAH at $2286 and 3) BAS at $294.43. 
55. 
Evidence was introduced at trial that for the year
2009, Fathers monthly gross income is $6866.87 or the sum of

$3,369[)] plus 2) BAH at $2,274 plus 3) BAS $323.87 and 4)
COLA at 900.00.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Findings of Fact in Family Court
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal under
the "clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is clearly
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in
support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has
 been made. "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable
a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 
(2001)). 
B. Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
C. Evidence - Foundation for Introduction
 
"When a question arises regarding the necessary 
foundation for the introduction of evidence, the determination of 
whether proper foundation has been established lies within the 
discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not be 
overturned absent a showing of clear abuse." State v. Assaye, 
121 Hawai' i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233 (2009) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted).

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Findings of Fact
 
1. FOF 33
 
The family court clearly erred in FOF 33 which finds
 
the child was conceived in the Philippines. Both Mother and
 
Father testified that Mother conceived the child in Seoul, South
 
Korea. Since this FOF does not have any bearing on the dispute
 
concerning arrearage, the error was harmless. 
2. FOFs 50-55 and 63-69
 
Father contends FOFs 50 through 55 and 63 through 69
 
are clearly erroneous where the family court based the findings
 on inadmissible evidence. FOFs 50 through 55 and 63 through 69
 
pertain to the family court determination of Father's income for
 
the years 2005 through 2009. Father presented evidence of his
 
taxable income for the years at issue and Mother sought to show
 
Father received additional income not listed on his tax returns
 
in the form of non-taxable military allowances. Though Father
 
did not deny receiving the additional income, Father testified he
 
was unsure of the amounts received for the years in question.
 
At the July 21, 2011 hearing, during direct examination
 
of Father, Mother offered into evidence exhibits U through FF,
 
which consisted of printed web pages from the internet. Mother
 
offered nothing other than these web pages as evidence of
 
authentication, stating the exhibits were "public record
 
information off of the Internet." Father objected on grounds
 
that the exhibits were not properly authenticated as required by
 
the Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE). Despite Father's objections
 
to the admissibility of Mother's exhibits U through FF, the
 
family court admitted the exhibits into evidence as public
 
records because they were from a "government website containing
 
public information."
 Evidence must be authenticated by extrinsic evidence
 
under HRE Rule 901 (1993) or qualify under HRE 902 (1993) as
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
self-authenticating. HRE Rule 901(a) (1993) provides, "[t]he
 
requirement of authentication or identification as a condition
 
precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to
 
support a finding that the matter in question is what its
 
proponent claims." Mother provided no extrinsic evidence to
 
authenticate or identify these web pages, and therefore, failed
 
to satisfy HRE 901(a) as to exhibits U through FF. 
HRE 902 provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 902 Self-authentication.  Extrinsic evidence
 
of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is
not required with respect to the following:
 
(1)	 Domestic public documents under seal. A document
 bearing a seal purporting to the be that of the United
States, or of any state, district, commonwealth,
territory, or insular possession thereof, . . . or of
a political subdivision, department, officer, or
agency thereof, and a signature purporting to be an
attestation or execution.
 
(2) 	Domestic public documents not under seal. A
 document purporting to bear the signature in the
official capacity of an officer or employee of any
entity included in paragraph (1), having no seal, if a
public officer having a seal and having official
duties in the district or political subdivision of the
officer or employee certifies under seal that the
signer has the official capacity and that the
signature is genuine.
 . . . . 
(4) 	Certified copies of public records. A copy of
an official record or report or entry therein, or of a
document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and
actually recorded or filed in a public office,
including data compilations in any form, certified as
correct by the custodian or other person authorized to
make the certification, by certificate complying with
paragraph (1), (2), or (3) or complying with any
statute or rule prescribed by the supreme court.
 
(5) 	Official publication. Books, pamphlets, or
other publications purporting to be issued by public
authority.
 
Mother's exhibits U through AA consisted of printed web
 
pages entitled "Basic Allowance for Housing[,] Rate Query
 
Results" with a website address containing a ".mil" domain
 
printed in the lower left hand corner of the document and the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
date the web page was printed. Each exhibit provided the amount
 
of housing allowance received by a service member of a certain
 
rank and housing area for each year from 2005 through 2009 and
 
2011. The ".mil" domain name is a top level domain name required
 
to be used by the Department of Defense. U.S. Dep't of Def.,
 
Instr. 8410.01 Internet Domain Name Use and Approval (Apr. 14,
 
2008), http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/841001p.pdf. 
Similarly, Mother's exhibit FF is a printed web page
 
entitled "Military Compensation: Basic Allowance for Subsistence
 
(BAS)" for the year 2009 bearing a seal from the Office of the
 
Secretary of Defense and the website address
 
http://militarypay.defense.gov/pay/bas/. The exhibit also bears
 
the notation: "This web site is published by the Office of the
 
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness." 
Generally, the internet domain ".gov" denotes a website
 
administered by a government entity. 41 C.F.R. §§ 102-173.5
 
(2012).2 As exhibits U through AA and FF appear to be "other
 
publications purporting to be issued by public authority," HRE
 Rule 902(5), they were self-authenticating and were properly
 
admitted. See Williams v. Long, 585 F. Supp. 2d 679, 689 (D. Md.
 
2008) ("A proponent . . . could use the URL, date, and/or
 official title on a printed webpage to show that the information
 
was from a public authority's website, and therefore,
 
self-authenticating.")
 
However, Mother's exhibits BB through EE consisted of
 
printed web pages from about.com.USMilitary, which displayed
 
"Basic Allowance for Sustenance Rates" for the years 2005 through
 
2
 Internet GOV Domain refers to the Internet top-level domain "dot­
gov" operated by the General Services Administration for the registration of
U.S. government-related domain names. In general, these names reflect the
organization names in the Federal Government and non–Federal government
entities in the United States. These names are now being used to promote
government services and increase the ease of finding these services.

2008, showed no evidence that the information is in any way
 
authored by the Department of Defense. Information obtained from
 
private websites do not qualify as self-authenticating under HRE
 
Rule 902. Fraserside IP L.L.C. v. Letyagin, 885 F.Supp.2d 906,
 
921 n.9 (N.D. Iowa 2012); Martinez v. America's Wholesale
 
Lender, 446 Fed. App'x. 940, 944 (9th Cir. 2012). 
In this case, the parties disputed the amount of child
 
support arrearage due by Father for the care of the child from
 
birth to November 1, 2009. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 576D­
3
7 (2006 Repl.),  which establishes guidelines for determining the
amount of child support, lists income as the first consideration
 
for calculating child support. HRS § 576D-7(a)(1) (Repl. 2006). 
Mother offered unauthenticated evidence and therefore,
 
inadmissible evidence to prove some of Father's income. The
 
family court used this inadmissible evidence to render its
 
decision in this matter. 
At the July 28, 2011 hearing, the family court stated: 
The Court: There's evidence and testimony –- we did
not have your –- your financial statements, but the Court
did look at the –- the evidence which was deduced from
 [Father] based upon what is public record based on his pay.
So that testimony was very compelling to the Court in
determining what his gross income is.
 . . . .
 
The testimony touched on a lot of your BAH, BAS, and
whether you did or did not receive it. And I believe based
 upon your testimony that you did receive those additional
amounts –- the BAH and BAS –- and that they were in the
amounts as stated for those particular years given your pay
grade in those particular amounts.
 
3
 HRS § 576D-7 provides in relevant part, 
§576D-7 Guidelines in establish amount of child support.
. . . .
 
The guidelines may include consideration of the following:
 (1)	 All earnings, income, and resources of both parents;
provided that earnings be the net amount, after deductions
for taxes, and social security. Overtime and cost of living
allowance may be deducted where appropriate[.]
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Now, if you had your pay stub, we would certainly be
able to refute that. But that is what the Court is going to
rely on based on the testimony and based upon the government
website, so to speak, for those years that are in question.
 
The income documentation provided by Father shows an
 
income far less than what was determined by the family court. No
 
other admissible evidence in the record supports the BAS income
 
figures used by the family court for the years 2005 through 2008. 
The family court erred in determining the amount of child support
 
arrearage based on exhibits BB through EE. 
Since the issue of child support arrearage must be
 
remanded, Father's additional arguments challenging certain
 
conclusions of law are moot. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The "Order Granting [MSH's] Motion For Relief After
 
Order Or Decree Filed September 27, 2010" entered in the Family
 
Court of the First Circuit on November 10, 2011 is vacated and
