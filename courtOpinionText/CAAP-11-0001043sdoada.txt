IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NOLAN K. CRABBE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 08-1-2331)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nolan K. Crabbe (Crabbe) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered on
 
October 14, 2011 in the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family
 
Court).1
 
Crabbe was found guilty of two (2) counts of Violating
 
a Temporary Restraining Order, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 586-4 (Supp. 2008).
 
On appeal, Crabbe contends the Family Court erred by
 
denying his motion to dismiss the charges as de minimis
 
violations.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Crabbe's point of error as follows:
 
1
 The Honorable Patrick W. Border presided over the motion to
dismiss. The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided over the trial.

This case involves violations of a restraining order
 
obtained by Crabbe's brother, who was the live-in caretaker for
 
their parents. The restraining order protected not only Crabbe's
 
brother, but anyone living with him. In pursuing his motion,
 
Crabbe argued that the violations were de minimis because they
 
occurred when he took his mother to and from church.2
 
A defendant’s conduct may be a de minimis infraction
 
under HRS § 702-236(1)(b) (1993) if it "[d]id not actually cause
 
or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law
 
defining the offense or did so only to an extent too trivial to
 
warrant the condemnation of conviction[.]"
 
In Rapozo, the supreme court stated: 
We have recognized previously that it is the
defendant's burden to place "all" of the relevant attendant
circumstances before the trial court, and to establish whydismissal is warranted in light of those circumstances.See, e.g., State v. Park, 55 Haw. 610, 616, 525 P.2d 586,591 (1974); State v. Viernes, 92 Hawai' i 130, 134, 988 P.2d
195, 199 (1999) (quoting State v. Vance, 61 Haw. 291, 307,602 P.2d 933, 944 (1979)). 
State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai' i 329, 331, 235 P.3d 325, 327 (2010). 
All the relevant attendant circumstances must be 
considered by the court. Id. at 337-38, 235 P.3d at 333-34. 
Appellate review of the court's determination under the de 
minimis statute is for abuse of discretion. State v. Park, 55 
Haw. 610, 617, 525 P.2d 586, 591-92 (1974). 
Crabbe presented his conduct through his attorney’s 
declaration and memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss. Crabbe offered no further evidence or testimony to corroborate 
the asserted explanation. Rapozo at 345, 235 P.3d at 341. On 
appeal, Crabbe concedes that his "actions caused the harm or evil sought to be prevented," but argues that "it was too trivial to 
warrant the condemnation of conviction." Crabbe does not explain 
2
 Crabbe's citation to trial testimony in his appeal is not relevant
to whether the Family Court properly denied his motion to dismiss. The Family
Court denied his motion to dismiss prior to trial. Crabbe did not renew his
 motion after trial testimony was concluded. Thus, Crabbe failed to bring this
evidence to the Family Court's attention in pursuing his motion to dismiss.
As a result, this court will only consider the facts and circumstances
proffered in Crabbe’s motion and argument at the hearing on the motion.

why his actions were too trivial to warrant conviction for
 
violating a TRO twice in the same day. Crabbe failed to carry
 
his burden of establishing that his conduct was a de minimis
 
violation, pursuant to HRS § 702-236. Therefore, the Family
 
Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied his motion to
 
dismiss. Rapozo at 348, 235 P.3d at 344.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, entered on October 14, 2011 in the Family Court of
 the First Circuit is affirmed.
