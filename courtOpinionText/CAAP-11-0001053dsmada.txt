v.
 
CC&D BUILDERS HAWAII, INC.,
Employer-Appellee
and
 
FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD., and

APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2008-439(M)
(7-05-45231))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Claimant-Appellant Larry W. Fousek's
 
(Appellant Fousek) appeal from the State of Hawai
'i Labor and 
1
 October 13,
 Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (the LIRAB)2011 decision and order.
 
1
 The State of Hawai' i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
was composed of Chairman Roland Q. F. Thom, Member Melanie S. Matsui, and
Member David A. Pendleton. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
 
(Supp. 2011) and HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), an aggrieved
 
party may appeal a decision or order by the LIRAB directly to the
 intermediate court of appeals.
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The supreme court has "held that an order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under the worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo 
Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai' i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 
(2004) (citation omitted). "[A] workers' compensation case . . . is an ongoing proceeding[;] . . . an inherent and unique characteristic of a workers' compensation case is its piecemeal nature." Id. at 169, 86 P.3d at 978 (citation omitted; brackets 
and ellipsis points in original). The LIRAB's October 13, 2011 decision and order finally ended the proceedings by affirming in part, modifying in part and reversing in part the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations' August 26, 2008 decision. The LIRAB's October 13, 2011 decision and order left nothing further to be accomplished. Therefore, the LIRAB's October 13, 2011 decision and order is "a final decision and order in a contested 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
case" under HRS § 91-14(a) that is appealable directly to the
 
intermediate court of appeals pursuant to HRS § 386-88.
 
However, Appellant Fousek did not file his December 12,
 
2011 notice of appeal within thirty days after the LIRAB's
 October 13, 2011 mailing of the LIRAB's October 13, 2011 decision
 and order, as HRS § 386-88 required. Therefore, Appellant
 Fousek's appeal is untimely. The failure to file a timely notice
 of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
 parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
 the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP­
11-0001053 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
