NO. CAAP-11-0001055
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RICHARD A. VIERRA, Claimant-Appellee,
 
v.

 
ASI SERVICES, INC., Employer-Appellant,
 
and
 
 
HAWAI'I EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, INC.,
 
Insurance Carrier-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-423; (2-06-13315))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
In this workers' compensation benefits case, Employer-
Appellant ASI Services, Inc. and Insurance Carrier-Appellant
 Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. (collectively,
 "Employer") appeal from the Decision and Order of the Labor and
 Industrial Relations Appeals Board ("Board"), filed October 25,
 2011 ("Decision"), and the Board's subsequent Order Denying
 Motion for Reconsideration, filed November 30, 2011.
 
On appeal, Employer contends that the Board (1) erred
 
by finding and concluding in Findings of Fact ("FOF") 9, 10 and
 11, and Conclusions of Law 1 and 2, that Claimant-Appellee
 Richard A. Vierra ("Vierra") was entitled to permanent partial
 disability ("PPD") benefits and compensation for the
 disfigurement to his left hand, which Vierra sustained following
 his October 24, 2006 work accident; and (2) abused its discretion
 by denying Employer's motion for reconsideration.
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 







 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the records and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments that they advance and the issues that they raise,
 we resolve Employer's points of error as follows and affirm:
 
(1) In its first point of error on appeal, Employer
 
argues that the Board erred by crediting the report prepared by
 Dr. Ronald O. Kienitz, D.O. following his independent medical
 examination of Vierra on March 24, 2008, and by disregarding Dr.
 Kienitz's supplemental report and the report prepared by Clifford
 K.H. Lau, M.D., which were both based on evidence obtained after
 March 24, 2008 from surveillance records and Vierra's pre-trial
 deposition. Employer also contends that "[t]he [Board's]
 Decision inexplicably relied on Dr. Kienitz's first report
 although not ruling that the surveillance records, Dr. Kienitz's
 supplemental report[, or] Dr. Lau's report lacked reliability." 
We review these assertions according to our established

 
standards of review:
 
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is
 
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial 

evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2)
 
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or
 
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite
 
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.
 
 
In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai 'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 
409, 431 (2000). Additionally, we ordinarily give deference to
 
 
decisions of administrative agencies such as the Board when those
 
 
agencies act within the scope of their expertise. Coon v. City &
 
 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai 'i 233, 245, 47 P.3d 348, 360 (2002). 
In so doing, we follow the established rule and
 
 
decline to consider the weight of the evidence [considered
by the Board] to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the
administrative findings, [and we will not] review the
agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of
witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially [because the
Board's] findings [are those] of an expert agency dealing
with a specialized field.
 
Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai 'i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002) 
(quoting Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai 'i 402, 409–10, 38 
P.3d 570, 577–78 (2001)). As long as substantial evidence 
supports the Board's findings on the credibility of witnesses, we do not disturb those findings. See Tamashiro v. Control 
Specialist, Inc. 97 Hawai
'i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001).

Substantial evidence is defined as "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai
'i at 119, 9 P.3d at 431 (quoting 
Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai 'i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 
1225 (1999)). 
With these standards in mind, we turn to the evidence. 
The Board did not ignore, but instead duly considered, both the
 surveillance records and each of the subsequent medical reports
 prepared by Drs. Kienitz and Lau. As for surveillance, the
 Board's FOF 4, which is unchallenged, states that its "close and
 specific review of the video with respect to [how Vierra used
 his] left hand [after the work injury] revealed that [Vierra]
 sometimes rubbed or massaged his left fingers with his right
 hand[] and held his left ring and pinky fingers in a fully flexed
 position." The subsequent medical reports were specifically
 referenced in FOFs 5 and 7. Thus, any assertion that the Board
 did not consider this evidence is misplaced. In sum, the Board
 considered and accorded sufficient weight to each of the
 subsequent medical reports submitted by Dr. Kienitz and Dr. Lau.
 
Furthermore, the Board did not err in failing to 
specifically rule on the reports. See Tamashiro, 97 Hawai
'i at 
92, 34 P.3d at 22 (holding that the Board did not err in according substantial weight to the testimony of certain witnesses and not according weight to others); Delaney v. Immanuel Enterprises, Ltd., No. 29384, 2011 WL 5561154, at *3 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2011) (concluding that the Board was not required to reject in its entirety a physician's report containing improper assumptions because the Board's findings and conclusions were not a "blanket adoption" of the report in its entirety, but were also "'[b]ased on the Board's review of the record[.]'") 
Employer contests Vierra's entitlement to PPD in light
 
of what it claims is "overwhelming evidence regarding [Vierra's]
 false disability presentation and history of deception." The
 Board's determination, however, was based largely on the relative
 weight it accorded to medical reports and Vierra's testimony. If
 
3
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
substantial evidence supports the Board's findings that are based on the credibility of witnesses, we do not disturb them. See 
Tamashiro, 97 Hawai
'i at 89, 34 P.3d at 19. Considering the 
Board's findings and the evidence in the record, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. 
Moreover, cases offered by the Employer in support of 
its contention that the Board "misconstrued the evidence, used flawed reasoning[,] and applied incorrect legal principles" to reach its Decision are misplaced. In Duque v. Hilton Hawaiian Vill., 105 Hawai
'i 433, 440, 98 P.3d 640, 647 (2004) and Cabatbat 
v. Cnty. of Hawai 'i, Dep't of Water Supply, 103 Hawai 'i 1, 7-8, 78 
P.3d 756, 762-63 (2003), for instance, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
reversed the Board, finding that the Board erred by only considering medical reports that relied on a particular medical text to determine impairment ratings, irrespective of the physician's training and education. Here, however, the Board considered all of the evidence before it. In fact, the Board considered the video that the Director disregarded in his original decision. 
Employer also attempts to analogize the instant case 
and Tauese v. State, Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations, 113 Hawai
'i 1, 147 P.3d 785 (2006). The argument seems to be that 
because the Board determined that the Tauese claimant committed fraud, it was inconsistent in its failure to reach the same conclusion about Vierra. The analogy fails. 
First, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that clear and 
convincing evidence was required to prove fraud, so it remanded to the Board for further proceedings because the Board erroneously applied the preponderance of the evidence test in reaching its decision. Id. at 36-37, 41, 147 P.3d at 820-21, 
825. Second, unlike the situation in Tauese, we are not asked to
 
review a fraud complaint against Vierra under HRS § 386-98(a)(8),
 nor does the record indicate that Employer filed such a complaint
 at any stage in this case. Finally, unlike its interpretation of
 the evidence in Tauese, here, the Board reviewed the surveillance
 video and noted that Vierra's left hand seemed affected even when
 he thought nobody was watching.

Based on the foregoing, we find that the Board did not
 
err with respect to its treatment of the evidence, and we reject
 Employer's first point of error accordingly.
 
(2) In its second point of error on appeal, Employer
 
argues that the Board abused its discretion when it denied
 Employer's motion for reconsideration. Employer contends that
 the Board's order both failed to address Employer's contention
 that the Decision was inconsistent with prior Board decisions in
 similar cases and disregarded the objective evidence of Vierra's
 misrepresentation of his alleged physical disability and
 disfigurement. We disagree.
1
 
Significantly, Employer fails to explain how, even if
 
true, its arguments show that the Board's order denying the
 motion for reconsideration was an abuse of discretion.
 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated
motion. Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding.
 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 
100 Hawai 'i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) (quoting Sousaris v. 
Miller, 92 Hawai 'i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Employer does not explain why an inconsistency argument
 
of this sort does not necessarily constitute "relitigat[ion of]
 old matters." Id. at 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621; see Tri-S Corp. v.
 
W. World Ins. Co., 110 Hawai
'i 473, 489, 135 P.3d 82, 98 (2006) 
("A circuit court does not abuse its discretion when no new argument is presented on reconsideration." (citing Sentinal Ins. Co. v. First Ins. Co. of Haw., 76 Hawai
'i 277, 290, 875 P.2d 894, 
907 (1994))). The substantive issues of Vierra's entitlement to PPD and the alleged misrepresentation of his condition were 
1/
 We reach that conclusion despite noting that the Board provided no
explanation for its decision to deny the motion. None of the cases cited 
support the proposition that a motion for reconsideration requires an 
explanation when the moving party argues that a prior decision was
inconsistent or reflected an improper weighing of the evidence. Cf. Ryan v. 
Tanabe Corp., 97 Hawai' i 305, 315, 37 P.3d 554, 564 (App. 1999) (holding that
the trial court did not "exceed[] the bounds of reason or disregard[] the
rules or principles of law or practice . . . when it granted Defendant'smotion for rehearing.")

thoroughly presented in the original Board proceeding. Even if
 
we were to ignore the threshold prohibition against relitigation
 of old matters, Employer's cases do not establish any
 inconsistency on the Board's part. Consequently, the argument is
 unpersuasive. 
Finally, Employer offers no reason why Vierra's alleged
 
misrepresentation of his condition, a central issue in the
 original Board proceeding, required the introduction of new
 evidence that was not and could not have been presented earlier.

Accordingly, we cannot hold that the Board abused its discretion
 in denying the motion for reconsideration, and Employer's second
 point of error fails.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 25, 2011 Decision
 
and Order, and the November 30, 2011 Order Denying Motion for
 Reconsideration of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 Board are affirmed.

 Employer cites to Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 Hawai' i 459, 466, 121 P.3d
924, 931 (App. 2005), in arguing that the Board incorrectly denied the motion
for reconsideration because the motion presented "important new evidence." In 
Tagupa, the Intermediate Court of Appeals held that the family court erred in
denying a claim for annulment of marriage without considering a supplementaldeclaration containing the deposition of the respondent's undivorced living
spouse. See Tagupa, 108 Hawai' i at 465-66, 121 P.3d at 930-31. However,
Employer fails to explain, and we do not discern, how any such "important new
evidence" was presented in the motion for reconsideration in this case.
