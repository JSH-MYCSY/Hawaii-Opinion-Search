APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(CRIMINAL NO. 00-1-0300))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Nolan L.K. Crabbe appeals from the 
September 16, 2011 "Order Denying Hearing, Dismissing Petition To 
Vacate, Set Aside, Or Correct Judgment Pursuant to Rule 40, HRPP 
(Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure) And Summarily Denying 
Petitioner's Ex Parte Motions" (September 16, 2011 order) filed 
1
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
I.
 
On June 9, 1998, the Respondent-Appellee State of 
Hawai
'i (State) indicted Crabbe on one count of extortion in the 
first degree and one count of terroristic threatening in the 
first degree in Cr. No. 98-1244. Represented by the Office of 
the Public Defender, Crabbe moved to dismiss the indictment. On

July 12, 1999, the circuit court  granted Crabbe's motion without
prejudice on the basis that the circuit court found that the
 
State failed to present clearly exculpatory evidence to the grand
 
jury.
 
On February 15, 2000, the State indicted Crabbe, for a
 
second time, in Cr. No. 00-1-0300 on one count of extortion in
 
the first degree based on the same facts underlying the previous
 
indictment in Cr. No. 98-1244. On September 12, 2000, Crabbe
 
filed a motion to dismiss for failure to present clearly
 
exculpatory evidence. On November 6, 2000, the circuit court3
 
denied the motion because the exculpatory evidence had been
 presented to the grand jury, albeit in a different form.
 
On November 17, 2000, Crabbe filed a second motion to
 
dismiss claiming that a prior ruling by Judge Town required
 
dismissal of the indictment in Cr. No. 00-1-0300. The circuit
 
court
4 denied the motion concluding that it was not bound by
 
Judge Town's decision in Cr. No. 98-1244.
 
During a status conference, Myles Breiner (Breiner)
 
replaced the Deputy Public Defender as Crabbe's attorney. 
Breiner then informed the circuit court that Crabbe wished to
 
change his plea. The following exchange occurred:
 
MR. BREINER: Your honor, I've prepared a change
of plea form. I've gone over it with Mr. Crabbe.
I have a copy and the original and I believethree other copies are with the court. 
THE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Crabbe. 
[CRABBE]: Good afternoon, your honor. 
THE COURT: It is the court's understanding that
you wish to change your plea now to guilty tothe charge of Extortion in the Third Degree; isthat correct? 
[CRABBE]: Yes, it is.

THE COURT: Okay. Okay. Because of that, the court
will be asking you some questions, Mr. Crabbe,
to make sure you understood the rights you mayhave had at trial. These rights you'll bewaiving because you're pleading to the chargeagainst you. You understand that? 
[CRABBE]: Yes, your honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. Could we have your full name please?

THE COURT: Okay. And your age? 
[CRABBE]: 43 
THE COURT: And the last grade completed? 
[CRABBE]: Six year college. 
. . . . 
THE COURT: You understand what the maximum jail time
and fine is for Extortion in the Third Degree? 
[CRABBE]: Yes, your honor. 
THE COURT: And what is that? 
[CRABBE]: A year imprisonment, $2,000 fine. 
. . . . THE COURT: Okay. Now, in this matter, in exchange for
your plea, the State -- you do have an agreement
with the State as reflected in a May 12th, 2001letter; is that correct? 
[CRABBE]: Yes. 
THE COURT: And in that situation they are reducing
the -- in exchange for your plea they arereducing this original charge down to Extortionin the Third Degree, correct? 
[CRABBE]: Yes, your honor. 
THE COURT: Also, that parties would be free to argue
at sentencing in this matter, correct? 
[CRABBE]: Yes. 
THE COURT: In addition, you are agreeing to the
revocation of your deferred acceptance of nocontest in Criminal numbers 97-0304 and 97-1355,correct? 
[CRABBE]: Yes. 
3
  Judge, I'm happy with that. I'm happy with
their -- there is a factual basis to the charge.
All we need to make sure that Mr. Crabbe agrees
that there is a factual basis.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
THE COURT: And in that case, resentencing will also
be open to both parties? 
MR. BREINER: That's correct. 
[CRABBE]: Yes, Your honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. Now, the court has had some pretrial
conferences regarding your matters in this caseand the court has expressed that it is inclinedto grant you probation. Now other than that, hasthere been any promises -- other promises,deals, favors made to you to change your plea inhis case? 
[CRABBE]: No, your honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. Has there been any threat, coercion
or pressure placed upon you to change your pleatoday? 
[CRABBE]: No, your honor?

THE COURT: Mr. Crabbe, you understand those
representations made by your attorney that there
is a factual basis for the existence of the
 charge?
 
[CRABBE]: Yes, I do. I understand it.
 
THE COURT: Thank you. And you accept that?
 
[CRABBE]: I accept it.
 
THE COURT: Thank you. Now, as to the charge of
Extortion in the Third Degree, Mr. Crabbe, how
do you plead?
 
[CRABBE]: Guilty.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On June 12, 2001, the following exchange occurred
 
during sentencing :
 
THE COURT: Based on the stipulation of the parties
for an order revoking no contest pleas in
Criminal Nos. 96-0-1355 and 97-0-0304, the court
will grant such stipulated order and will be
signing the stipulation revoking the previously
given deferred acceptance of no contest plea.
 
Has counsel been able to review the 
presentence report in this matter? Any changes
or corrections?
 
[DPA]: Your Honor, there was no presentence
report in 00-1-0300. However, the State has
reviewed the presentence investigation report in
Criminal Nos. 97-0304 and 96-0-1355. We have no
 changes, corrections, or additions.
 
THE COURT: Thank you.
 
MR. BREINER: Same for the defense, Your Honor. We 
agree by stipulation that a new PSI was not
necessary since they essentially involved the
same issues in these cases and parties as in the
other two cases. Likewise we reviewed it. No
 additions or modifications.
 
THE COURT: Thank you.
 
Any arguments as to sentencing, [DPA]?
 
[DPA]: Your Honor, the State will ask the court
to sentence Mr. Crabbe to probation for a term
of five years in the felony matters and for one
year in the 0300 matter. That was reduced to a
misdemeanor. Standard terms and conditions. We
 also ask for a stay-away order[.]
 
MR. BREINER:  Your Honor, on behalf of Mr. -- excuse me.
On behalf of Mr. Crabbe, we have no objection to
the conditions outlined by [the DPA]. However,
under the terms and conditions of the plea offer
which is attached as an exhibit and the court
 agreed to be bound to the Rule 11 to the plea,
although the defendant agreed to the revocation
of his deferred acceptance in Criminal
No. 97-0304 and 96-1355, the State insisted
that -- and I'm quoting -- resentencing of those
two cases, argument also open to the parties.
 
Under those terms, since in my mind we're
starting from scratch and counsel is asking that
[Crabbe] be placed on probation in all
three cases including this one, we believe the
court can effectively give him deferred
acceptance and apply it across the board. So I'm
asking on behalf of Mr. Crabbe that the court
 
5
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
permit the defendant a deferred acceptance of
guilty plea in this matter.
 
.  .  .  .
 
Under the circumstances we believe a
 
deferred acceptance would be appropriate. These
 
are the only issues that arise in his life that
resulted in a criminal conviction. They're
three years old going on four years on this
violation. He's had no other violations on his
 deferred acceptance. There's been no issues of
violence, drugs, not even a DUI or a traffic
s t o p .
 
So he did well on the deferred acceptance.
In my mind we believe the court has the
authority because he's being resentenced to all
three. I know the court --- or, excuse me,
counsel disagrees with that interpretation, but
that's my viewpoint of the statute and your
authority.
 
[DPA]: If I can just briefly address myself to
that. The State takes the position that because
Mr. Crabbe has agreed to the revocation of his
deferral status in the two felony matters that
he is now statutorily ineligible for any further
deferrals from this court. And we believe that
 such a disposition would be illegal. Thank you.
 
THE COURT: Thank you.
 
Mr. Crabbe, you also have the right and
opportunity at this time to make a statement
regarding sentencing that the court shall
consider before sentencing you.
 
[CRABBE]: I just appreciate the court's time in
reviewing this matter and the offers to the
court as long as it's taken to resolve this
matter. And I am confident that Your Honor will
 choose what is best for myself based on what's
been presented so far.
 
THE COURT: Thank you.
 
Mr. Crabbe, the court will follow has had
pretrial conferences regarding this matter, will
follow the State's recommendation that there be
 five years probation given in the two felony
matters with only special condition that you
stay away from Harrison Mew and Island Auto Air,
Inc., as that's the only two special conditions.
 
As to No, 00-1-0300, this misdemeanor,
there will be one year probation. So basically,
Mr. Crabbe, there aren't many special conditions
to the probation on the standard conditions of
probation we believe because of the
circumstances involved here. I'm sure you have
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a solid background of employment as well as
community service that is actually quite
impressive. So I'm sure that you will maintain
your successful future and will not be returning
to this court.
 
The circuit court approved the stipulated agreement to revoke
 
Crabbe's deferred acceptance of no contest pleas in Cr. Nos.
 
96-1355 and 97-0304 and sentenced him to five years probation in
 
each of those cases. The circuit court then sentenced Crabbe to
 
one year probation in Cr. No. 00-1-0300.
 
Nine years later, on November 17, 2010, Crabbe filed a
 
"Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment" (Petition).
 
Subsequently, Crabbe filed numerous motions and requests. On
 
September 16, 2011, the circuit court denied the Petition finding
 
"Crabbe's claims to be patently frivolous and without trace of
 
support either in the record or from other evidence submitted[.]" 
The circuit court also denied Crabbe's other motions and
 
requests.
 
II.
 
"[W]hether the trial court erred in denying a Rule 40 
petition without a hearing based on no showing of a colorable claim is reviewed de novo thus, the right/wrong standard of 
review is applicable." State v. Dan, 76 Hawai' i 423, 427, 879 
P.2d 528, 532 (1994). 
III.
 
For purposes of this appeal we need only address one of
 
the numerous issues Crabbe raises, whether he was entitled to a
 
hearing on his Rule 40 claim of ineffectiveness of counsel. 
Because we conclude Crabbe was entitled to such a hearing we
 
vacate the September 16, 2011 order of the circuit court, making
 
Crabbe's other points on appeal premature.
 
HRPP Rule 40(f) provides that: 
[i]f a petition alleges facts that if proven would
entitle the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a
hearing which may extend only to the issues raised in the
petition or answer. However, the court may deny a hearing
if the petitioner's claim is patently frivolous and is
 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
without trace of support either in the record or from other
evidence submitted by the petitioner.
 
Hawai'i appellate courts have applied the following law in 
reviewing appeals from a denial of an HRPP Rule 40 petition:
 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule
40 petition for post-conviction relief where the petition
states a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim,
the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as
true the facts alleged would change the verdict, however, a
petitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true. Where
examination of the record of the trial court proceedings
indicates that the petitioner's allegations show no
colorable claim, it is not error to deny the petition
without a hearing. The question on appeal of a denial of a
 Rule 40 petition without a hearing is whether the trial
 
record indicates that Petitioner’s application for relief
 made such a showing of a colorable claim as to require a
 hearing before the lower court.
 
Dan, 76 Hawai' i at 427, 879 P.2d at 533 (quoting State v. Allen, 
7 Haw. App 89, 92-93, 744 P.2d 789, 792-93 (1987)). 
The question posed in an effective assistance of 
counsel claim is "when viewed as a whole, was the assistance 
provided to the [defendant] within the range of competence 
demanded of attorneys in criminal cases?" State v. Richie, 88 
Hawai'i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
[T]he defendant has the burden of establishing ineffective
assistance of counsel and must meet the following two-part
test:
 
1) that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting
counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that
such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal
 or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense.
 
Id. (quoting State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 480, 946 P.2d 32, 
50 (1997)). 
Crabbe contends "Breiner fraudulently induced him into
 
pleading guilty constituted ineffective assistance of counsel."
 
(formatting and emphasis omitted). The circuit court in denying
 
Crabbe's Rule 40 petition without a hearing apparently relied on
 
the court's colloquy with Crabbe. Crabbe indicated that he was
 
college educated, he understood the possible sentence for
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pleading guilty, and that he agreed to the revocation of his
 
deferred acceptance of no contest in Cr. Nos. 96-1355 and 97-304.
 
Crabbe also indicated that he was not coerced and that he was
 
satisfied with the work of his attorney.
 
Crabbe claims that he was induced to enter that plea. 
In his rule 40 petition, which was supported by his declaration,
 
Crabbe claimed:
 
BREINER UNLAWFULLY INDUCED CRABBE INTO A PLEA OF
 
GUILTY, WITHOUT EXPLAINING TO CRABBE THE LEGAL EFFECT and
EACH and EVERY CONSEQUENCE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A PLEA OF
GUILTY IN THIS 2000 CASE[.]
 
IF BREINER WAS AS EFFECTIVE . . . CRABBE WOULD HAVE
 
BEEN LAWFULLY AND PROPERLY ADVISED, SO THAT CRABBE COULD
HAVE MADE AN INTELLIGENT CHOICE ABOUT PLEADING GUILTY IN
 THIS 2000 CASE. BUT BREINER WAS INEFFECTIVE AS CRABBE'S
 DEFENSE COUNSEL BECAUSE HE ILL-INFORMED CRABBE AND AVOIDED
 TELLING CRABBE THE ENTIRE TRUTH ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD
RESULT FROM PLEADING GUILTY, BEFORE CRABBE MADE THE CHOICE TO
DO SO.
 
BY PLEADING GUILTY IN THIS 2000 CASE, CRABBE BECAME A
CONVICTED FELON TO 3 FELONY COUNTS AS OF THE DATE THE
 JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION WAS ENTERED HEREIN, WHICH WAS JUNE
12, 2001. CRABBE WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE WAS A CONVICTED
 FELON SINCE THEN, BECAUSE BREINER ONLY TOLD CRABBE ABOUT
THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY TO THE LESSER CHARGE OF
EXTORTION IN THE THIRD DEGREE, AS A MISDEMEANOR.
 
BY PLEADING GUILTY IN THIS 2000 CASE, THE MARCH 25,
1998 DANC PLEA CRABBE WAS GRANTED IN THE 1996 GUN CASE AND THE
 1996 THEFT CASE, WAS REVOKED BY THIS COURT. IF CRABBE KNEW THAT
 THE MARCH 25, 1998 DANC PLEA WAS GOING TO BE REVOKED BEFORE CRABBE
PLEADED GUILTY IN THIS 2000 CASE, CRABBE WOULD NEVER HAVE AGREED
TO PLEAD AS BREINER ADVISED AND INDUCED CRABBE TO PLEAD.
 
. . . .
 
BREINER PUPOSELY DID NOT ADVISE CRABBE THAT WHEN CRABBE
 
BECAME A CONVICTED FELON AS A RESULT OF HAVING HAD THE MARCH 25,
1998 DANC PLEA REVOKED IN THE 1996 GUN CASE AND THE 1996 THEFT
 CASE, AS SOON AS CRABBE PLEADED GUILTY IN THIS 2000 CASE, CRABBE
WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE AND SUBJECT TO BE SENTENCED AS A REPEAT
 OFFENDER, IF CONVICTED OF ANY FELONY AT ANY TIME AFTER CRABBE
PLEADED GUILTY IN THIS 2000 CASE, AND SUBJECT TO AN EXTENDED
MANDATORY TERM OF IMPRISONMENT, LIKE CRABBE WAS SENTENCED TO SERVE
BY JUDGE DEXTER DEL ROSARIO ON JANUARY 27, 2010.
 
. . . .
 
BREINER told CRABBE ". . . just keep on doing what
you're doing and keep your nose clean like you have been,
and everything will be alright. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT
 YOU'LL HAVE A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION ON YOUR RECORD. EVEN
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
I'VE GOT ONE ON MY RECORD, AND ITS NO BIGGIE, YOU'LL BE FINE
NOLAN.
 
BREINER also told CRABBE that CRABBE's probation was
revoked. But when he articulated the NEW 5-YEAR PROBATION
 conditions of WHITE's guilty plea agreement offer to CRABBE
BREINER DISSEMBLED THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MARCH 25, 1998 DANC PLEA,
BY NOT BRINGING THE WORDS "DANC PLEA" INTO THE DISCUSSION, and
thus INDUCED CRABBE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL 5-YEAR PROBATION WHICH WAS REVOKED; AND TO
WHICH A DEFERRED ACCEPTANCE OF NO CONTEST WAS ATTACHED, AND THE
 
NEW 5-YEAR PROBATION, WHICH DID NOT
.
 
. . . .
 
NOT ONCE, DID BREINER TELL CRABBE TO HIS FACE, OR
OTHERWISE, THAT CRABBE WOULD BECOME A CONVICTED FELON TO 3
FELONY COUNTS, AS SOON AS CRABBE PLEADED GUILTY IN THIS 2000
CASE.
 
. . . .
 
THE ONLY CONVICTION BREINER FOCUSED ON DURING HIS
 
DISCUSSION WITH CRABBE ABOUT JULIAN WHITE's GUILTY PLEA AGREEMENT
 
OFFER, WAS THE MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION[.]
 
(Emphases omitted.)
 
In his memorandum in reply to the State's answer to his
 
Rule 40 petition, which was supported by his declaration, Crabbe
 
alleged that: (1) shortly after advising Crabbe that Breiner
 
could exonerate Crabbe at trial, Breiner "out of the blue" called
 
Crabbe and advised him to accept the prosecutor's plea offer; (2)
 
prior to the change of plea hearing, Breiner instructed Crabbe to
 
agree to everything the judge asked at the hearing and to tell
 
the judge that he understood everything and Breiner had explained
 
everything; (3) Crabbe entered his plea in Cr. No. 00-1-0300
 
because, based on his discussions with Breiner, Crabbe understood
 
that he "would be granted a brand new DANC plea with a new 5-year
 
probation in consolidated cases Cr. No. 96-1355 and Cr. No.
 
97-0304, and a 1-year probation in Cr. No. 00-1-0300 to run
 
concurrently" and that these cases would be "expunged from my
 
criminal record"; (4) in response to the judge's questions at the
 
change of plea hearing, Crabbe answered "yes" and said that he
 
understood things, even though he did not, because Breiner
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advised him to do so "in order to make the plea agreement work";
 
(5) Breiner did not present or explain the guilty plea form to
 
Crabbe before the change of plea hearing, and Crabbe was not
 
given the opportunity to read the form, but he signed the form at
 
the hearing because he believed it reflected his discussions with
 
Breiner; (6) Breiner concealed the guilty plea form from Crabbe
 
because Breiner knew it contained terms that were inconsistent
 
with the terms he discussed with Crabbe; and (7) if Breiner had
 
disclosed the actual terms of the plea agreement to Crabbe,
 
Crabbe would not have signed the guilty plea form or pleaded
 
guilty in Cr. No. 00-1-0300. 
In determining whether a hearing was required on 
Crabbe's Rule 40 petition, we must consider whether the petition 
"alleges facts that 
if proven would entitle the petitioner to 
relief[.]" HRPP Rule 40(f) (emphasis added). That is, "[t]o establish a colorable claim, the allegations of the petition must 
show that if taken as true the facts alleged would change the 
verdict [or outcome], however, a petitioner's conclusions need 
not be regarded as true." Barnett v. State, 91 Hawai' i 20, 26 
979 P.2d 1046, 1052 (1999) (quoting Allen, 7 Haw. App at 92-93, 744 P.2d at 792-93) (block quote format altered, emphasis added). 
Taking Crabbe's allegations as true would lead to the 
conclusion that Crabbe was denied effectiveness of counsel. 
Crabbe's allegations include that Breiner concealed the actual 
terms of the plea agreement from him, induced Crabbe into 
believing that his DANC pleas would remain in effect on his prior 
felony cases, and improperly advised him to plead guilty in Cr. 
No. 00-1-0300. The State did not submit an affidavit from Breiner 
in response to Crabbe's Rule 40 petition. Crabbe alleges Breiner 
made "specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of 
skill, judgment, or diligence" and that "such errors or omissions 
resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a 
potentially meritorious defense." Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 39, 360 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d at 1247 (quoting Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i at 480, 946 P.2d at 
50) (block quote format altered). Crabbe's guilty plea resulted 
in the waiver of important constitutional guarantees, including a 
right to trial, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the 
right to confront his accusers. See Reponte v. State, 57 Haw. 
354, 362, 556 P.2d 577, 583 (1976) "Such a waiver is not constitutionally acceptable unless made voluntarily and with full 
understanding of the consequence." Id. (internal quotation marks 
omitted).
