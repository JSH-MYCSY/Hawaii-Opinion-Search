ANTHONY K. SELVAGE, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LAURA MOIRE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 08-1-0252)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth, J.
and Ginoza, J., concurring and dissenting)
 
Defendant-Appellant Laura Moire appeals from the
 
November 16, 2011 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 
Divorce Decree ("Decree"), entered in the Family Court of the
 Third Circuit, South Kohala Division ("Family Court").
1 In
 
addition to granting Moire and Plaintiff-Appellee Anthony K.
 Selvage a divorce, the Decree divided the couple's marital
 property, and, among other things, credited Selvage with
 $2,270,199.90 of Marital Partnership Property Category 3 assets 
("Category 3 Credit Award") associated with Selvage's inheritance
 of his parents' trust.

 Five categories of net market value ("NMV") are utilized by the
family court in dividing marital assets. Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 
126, 147, 276 P.3d 695, 716 (2012) (citing Cox v. Cox, 125 Hawai' i 19, 26, 250
P.3d 775, 782 (2011)). Category 3 (Marital Partnership Property) includes
"[t]he date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or minus, of property separately acquiredby gift or inheritance during the marriage but excluding the NMV attributableto property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the other
spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party." Id. at 147 n.3, 276 P.3d at
(continued...)
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Without expressly challenging any specific findings of
 
fact ("FOF") or conclusions of law, Moire raises three points of
 
error on appeal, asserting that the Family Court erred by: (1)
 failing to deduct inheritance-related litigation expenses from
 Selvage's Category 3 Credit Award; (2) including the trust income
 and interest that Selvage received after his mother's death in
 its calculation of the Category 3 assets; and (3) failing to
 deviate from the Partnership Model.
3
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Moire's points of error as follows and affirm:
 
(1) The Family Court did not abuse its discretion4
 by
failing to deduct inheritance-related litigation expenses from
 Selvage's Category 3 Credit Award. 
Prior to the final distribution, Selvage engaged in
 
several inheritance-related legal disputes with his sister over
 what he alleged to be the wasting of trust assets for which he
 incurred approximately $385,000 in costs and fees. 
According to
 
Selvage, these expenses were incurred at the express
 encouragement of Moire. Selvage paid the expenses with trust
 funds, which he requested and received from the trust. 
Moire does not contest that the inheritance was a
 
Category 3 asset, or that Selvage should receive a credit for the
 bulk of it. Rather, she contends that the litigation expense
 portion did not "contribute" to the couple's marital partnership
 
2(...continued)
716 n.3 (quoting Cox, 125 Hawai' i at 26, 250 P.3d at 782). "Generally,
assuming all valid and relevant considerations are equal, the Category 1 and 3
NMVs are the partner's contributions to the Marital Partnership Property that
are repaid to the contributing spouse[.]" Id. at 147, 276 P.3d at 716
(quoting Cox, 125 Hawai' i at 26, 250 P.3d at 782) (internal quotation marks
omitted). 
3
 Although Moire initially raised an additional point of error in
her opening brief related to an inheritance from Selvage's father, she later
withdrew the point, so we do not discuss it here. 
4
 Because property division "is discretionary with the trial court,"
it "will not be disturbed on review unless abuse of discretion is clearly
shown." Baker v. Bielski, 124 Hawai' i 455, 458, 248 P.3d 221, 224 (App. 2011)
(quoting Farias v. Farias, 58 Haw. 227, 231, 566 P.2d 1104, 1108 (1977)).

and should therefore be deducted from Selvage's Category 3 Credit
 
Award.5
 
Hawai'i courts have never held that an inheritance's 
NMV reflects the inheritance minus any acquisition or maintenance costs. Upon divorce in such cases, Hawai
'i law requires only 
that, if all valid and relevant considerations are equal, Category 3 NMVs are repaid to the contributing spouse. Hussey v. 
Hussey, 77 Hawai
'i 202, 207, 881 P.2d 1270, 1275 (App. 1994), 
overruled on other grounds by State v. Gonsalves, 91 Hawai 'i 446, 
984 P.2d 1272 (App. 1999). 
Moire does not contend that the litigation expenses
 
were unreasonable or represented waste, or that the expenses and
 resulting acquisition of the asset occurred outside the marital
 partnership.
6 Therefore, apart from the issue of whether the
 
valid and relevant considerations were unequal (which Moire
 addresses in her third point of error), the Family Court did not
 abuse its discretion in declining to deduct the litigation
 expenses from Selvage's Category 3 Credit Award, and Moire's
 first point of error fails.
 
(2) Moire's second point of error relates to trust
 
distributions between 2004 and 2010 that are referred to in
 Selvage's exhibit as "Trust income," which Moire contends should
 have been recognized as a Category 4 asset and not a Category 3
 asset. This is so, according to Moire, because "there was [an]
 increase in the value of the [trust] corpus through income and
 interest BEFORE [Selvage] finally had possession of the corpus,"
 which should be treated as a Category 4 asset. We disagree.
 
Moire correctly states the point of law, but fails to
 
5
 Moire's argument to the Family Court was even more limited.
Citing no authority for the proposition that NMV requires deduction of any
acquisition or maintenance costs, she contended simply that "the marital
estate should not be taxed with the cost of [Selvage] securing the very funds
he is seeking to be awarded solely." Contrary to what she now argues on
appeal, Moire proposed instead that the litigation expenses should be included
as a marital asset and assigned to Selvage. 
6
 A marital partnership exists until the date of the conclusion of
the evidentiary part of the trial. See Jackson v. Jackson, 84 Hawai' i 319,
335, 933 P.2d 1353, 1369 (App. 1997). Here, the evidentiary part of the trialconcluded on April 4, 2011, which was subsequent to the determination of thetrust inheritance. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
establish that the trust distributions in question, although
 
denominated as "Trust income," represented anything other than
 periodic distributions to Selvage of the trust corpus. Nothing
 in the exhibit to which Moire refers establishes that any of the
 distributions reflect an increase in the value of the trust
 corpus after its acquisition by Selvage on the dates stated in
 the exhibit. 
Although Moire contends that Selvage's interest in the
 
trust vested in early 2004 when Selvage's mother passed away, she
 also acknowledges that Selvage "finally [took] possession of the
 [trust] corpus" in October 2010. Moire provides no authority,
 and we are unaware of any, to support the proposition that
 Selvage could have "acquired" the trust assets prior to receiving
 them through draws or distribution. Moreover, Moire does not
 demonstrate that the Family Court disregarded the net market
 value of trust assets distributed to Selvage. Therefore, the
 Family Court did not abuse its discretion in not excluding any
 increase in the value of the inheritance corpus before its
 acquisition by Selvage.
 
(3) In her third point of error, Moire contends that
 
the Family Court (a) abused its discretion in not deviating from
 the Partnership Model
7 when it divided the marital property,8
 and
that it (b) erred when it made no findings "as to whether there
 were facts present which authorized a deviation from the
 [P]artnership [M]odel."
 
(a)
 Whether the facts presented at trial constituted

considerations [], each partner is generally awarded his or her capital
contribution, while the appreciation is split fifty-fifty." Kakinami, 127
Hawai'i at 130 n.4, 276 P.3d at 699 n.4. 
8
 Moire argues that the Family Court should have considered five
factors: (1) Moire "was a practicing doctor but only [earned] about $6,666 per
month," was limited by a hand injury, and had invested the compensation thatshe had received for the injury "into the Hawaii house (which the trial courtultimately awarded to [Selvage])"; (2) Moire would be "homeless" if Selvagewere awarded both houses; (3) an award to Selvage of Category 3 maritalpartnership property credit would "eat up" an otherwise fair distribution ofmarital assets; (4) the length of the marriage "justified a more equitabledistribution of non-Category 3 property"; and (5) "[a]n award of the [MountainView, Hawai' i] home to [Moire] would have been equitable and left [Selvage]
with still over $2,000,000 in assets and a home in California." 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
valid and relevant considerations ("VARCs") warranting deviation
 
from the Partnership Model is a matter of law which we review
 under the right/wrong standard. Schiller v. Schiller, 120
 
Hawai
'i 283, 287, 205 P.3d 548, 552 (App. 2009) (quoting Jackson 
v. Jackson, 84 Hawai 'i 319, 332-33, 933 P.2d 1353, 1366-67 (App. 
1997)). Of the five factors that Moire raises on appeal, she
 only addressed the first, third, and fourth, even briefly, to the
 court below.
9 Argument as to the second and fifth factors,
 
therefore, is waived.10 Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7); Cox, 125
 
9 Moire's deviation argument below was limited to a single paragraph
in each of her written closing argument and the subsequent responsive closing
argument. In its entirety, the argument in the written closing argument read:
 
Wife is lastly asking for deviation. As has been
 
testified to, this was a very long marriage with substantial
assets at stake. Wife worked and paid the bills, and when
could not, paid them with her disability settlement.
Husband was a working musician who testified he took care of
the home and family while Wife paid the bills. If Husband's
 requests are followed, it will result in Husband receiving
all, or a disproportionate share of the marital estate,
generally and in consideration of the efforts of the parties
to create that estate. Hawaii law requires the distribution
to be equitable, and does not limit the Court to an equal
division, just as it does not mandate that the return of
category one or three is mandatory if equity demands
otherwise. In the present instance equity requires that
both parties share in the fruits of their labor and that the
property division reflect that. Wife is asking the Court to
deviate from standard partnership principles if such is
necessary to effect an equitable result.
 
In relevant part, the argument in the responsive closing argument read:
 
Defendant further requests the Court to view the
attached property division chart as fair based upon the
position the parties will be left in at the conclusion of
this case. If Plaintiff's position is accepted, after a 26
year marriage in which Wife worked and provided, Wife will
be left with nothing but debt, and Husband will have
approximately $3,000,000 in cash, equities, and real
property. This Court . . . has the discretion to issue
 awards which will take into account the condition each party
will be left in at the conclusion of the case.
 
10
 Moire did argue, however, that it would be inequitable to award
Selvage both the Topanga Canyon, California and the Mountain View, Hawai' i 
residences. In fact, the dissent contends that the award of both residencesindicated an inequity constituting a VARC. We disagree. The Family Courtfound that the Topanga Canyon residence was purchased by Selvage prior to themarriage, and was thus his sole and separate property. As for the Mountain View residence, Selvage testified that he had lived in Hawai' i for more than 
twenty years, and the parties stipulated that Selavage was living in Hawai' i 
for at least six months prior to the filing of the divorce complaint. Moire testified that she was currently employed in a California hospital, butprovided little to no testimony or any other evidence as to her currentresidence other than that she "fe[lt]" she lived part-time in Hawai' i and that

Hawai'i at 26, 250 P.3d at 782.
 As to the first factor, Moire claimed that the
 
compensation that she received for her hand injury was "invested
 
into the Hawaii house (which the trial court ultimately awarded
 to [Selvage])." Money being both liquid and fungible, however,
 Moire does not point to anywhere in the record where those
 investments are demonstrated. Furthermore, Moire failed to
 provide evidence that her hand injury limited her current ability
 to work, or that her current earning capacity would leave her in
 a disadvantageous condition relative to Selvage.
 
As to the third factor, Moire argued that she would be
 
left with "nothing but debt" while Selvage would have
 approximately $3,000,000 in property, and attached a property
 division chart indicating that the initial division would leave
 her $49,484.39 in debt. Neither Moire's characterization of her
 status nor her property division chart, however, prove accurate.
 
When determining whether VARCs exist that authorize the 
family court to deviate from the Partnership Model, the family court must consider a number of factors listed in Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 580-47(a), including "the respective merits of the parties, . . . the condition in which each party will be left by the divorce, . . . and all other circumstances of the case." Gordon v. Gordon, ___ Hawai

12-0000806, 2015 WL 3540523, at *28 (Haw. June 4, 2015) (quoting Haw. Rev. Stat. § 580-47(a) (2006)). See also, e.g., Jackson, 84 
Hawai
'i at 333, 933 P.2d at 1367 (quoting Epp v. Epp, 80 Hawai 'i 
79, 89, 905 P.2d 54, 64 (App. 1995)); Jacoby v. Jacoby, 134 Hawai
'i 431, 447-48, 341 P.3d 1231, 1247-48 (App. 2014). The 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has recently clarified that "the court's 
analysis in deciding whether or not to apply a deviation should focus on the abilities of the parties and the circumstances in which each party will be left by the divorce."

Hawai'i at ___, ___ P.3d at ___, 2015 WL 3540523, at *11. 
In 2011, HRS § 580-47(a) was amended to specify that 
the family court must also consider "the concealment of or 
failure to disclose income or an asset[.]" See Haw. Rev. Stat. 
§ 580-47(a) (Supp. 2011); Gordon, ___ Hawai 'i at ___, ___ P.3d at 
___, 2015 WL 3540523, at *6 n.8. Although this amendment did not have an effect on the Family Court's November 16, 2011 Decree,
12 
the 2011 amendment reflects the fact that the family court must rely upon the evidence it has before it, and that, when considering circumstances where a party has provided an incomplete record of assets and debts, the court should refrain from deviating. That principle applies here as well. Here, Moire did not provide credible evidence of an inequity justifying a finding of a VARC. While the Family Court did not make an express finding regarding inequity, it did find that there was no credible evidence for many of Moire's claimed assets and debts. 
Furthermore, contrary to Moire's calculations, the
 
Family Court (i) determined that the balance in her 401k account
 at the conclusion of the trial was approximately $10,000 more
 than Moire represented, and (ii) awarded the parties' joint
 Ameriprise account to Moire. Thus, the Family Court's property
 division did not leave Moire in "debt," as she received
 $66,278.87 after the initial division, and was left with
 $37,059.11 after the equalization payment. 
Selvage's acquisition of a large amount of Category 3 
credit is, by itself, not a VARC. Cf. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 
143, 276 P.3d at 712 (a Marital Separate Property inheritance "does not, without more, mandate deviation from the Marital Partnership Model." (quoting Kakinami v. Kakinami, 2011 WL 1836718, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. May 11, 2011) (SDO)) (emphasis omitted)). Although Moire claimed that the result was inequitable, considering the court's findings that Moire failed

 See 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 140, § 3, 5 at 356 (providing that
although the Act had an effective date of October 1, 2011, it did "not affect
. . . proceedings that were begun before its effective date.")
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
to provide credible evidence, we cannot say that the Family Court 
erred in not finding the alleged inequity to be a VARC. Cf. 
Gordon, ___ Hawai 'i at ___, ___ P.3d at ___, 2015 WL 3540523, at 
*12 (holding that the family court abused its discretion in deviating from the partnership model after erroneously considering financial misconduct to be a VARC). 
As to the fourth factor, the Family Court recognized 
the length of the parties' marriage as relevant, but correctly did not conclude that it amounted to a VARC. See Jackson, 84 
Hawai
'i at 334, 933 P.2d at 1368 (holding that the "shortness" of 
a marriage was not a VARC). "Other than relative circumstances of the parties when they entered into the marital partnership and possible exceptional situations . . ., HRS § 580-47(a) requires the family court to focus on the present and the future, not the past." Id. at 333, 933 P.2d at 1367 (quoting Epp, 80 Hawai
'i at 
89, 905 P.2d at 64 (App. 1995)). In sum, therefore, the Family Court did not err in failing to find facts sufficient to constitute VARCs. 
(b) As to the second argument, the Partnership Model 
requires that the court "itemize" its "considerations" only if it first decides that the facts present VARCs authorizing deviation. Schiller, 120 Hawai
'i at 287, 205 P.3d at 552 (quoting Jackson, 
84 Hawai 'i at 332, 933 P.2d at 1366). Nothing requires that a 
court make findings "as to whether there were facts present which authorized a deviation from the partnership model," as Moire contends. 
Here, the Family Court set out what it deemed to be the
 
relevant facts and proceeded from there to allocate the parties'
 assets and debts in accordance with the Partnership Model. 
Implicitly, then, it found no VARCs warranting deviation from the
 model. We know of no authority that requires a court to enter
 explicit findings if it finds no VARCS that warrant deviation,
 nor does Moire cite to any. Thus, the Family Court did not err
 when it made findings of relevant facts but did not enter express
 findings "as to whether there were facts present which authorized
 a deviation from the partnership model."
