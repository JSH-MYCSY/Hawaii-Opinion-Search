NO. CAAP-11-0001068
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
PALISADE POINTE ESTATES, INC., a Georgia Corporation,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v. SYLVIA CABRAL, Appellant, ADRIENNE PUANANI
GONSALVES; et al., Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 97-0730(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Appellant Sylvia Cabral (Cabral) appeals pro se from
 
the Order Denying Motion to Join Person as Party entered by the
 
Circuit Court for the Second Circuit (Circuit Court) on
 
January 10, 2012.1 This case arises out of Plaintiff-Appellee
 
Palisade Pointe Estates, Inc.'s (Palisade) September 24, 1997
 Complaint to Quiet Title.
 
Cabral argues that the Circuit Court erred because
 
(1) it denied her motion to join; (2) it discriminated against 

 
her or permitted discrimination against her; (3) it did not grant
 quiet title in her favor; (4) it committed judicial
 
transgressions; (5) it did not recognize or permitted attorney
 
negligence; and (6) it violated her due process rights.
 
After a careful review of the points raised by Cabral,
 
the arguments made by Cabral and Palisade, the applicable

 
authority, and the record, we resolve Cabral's points as follows
 and affirm.

 The Honorable Shackley F. Rafetto presided.

A.	 This Court has Jurisdiction to Hear Cabral's
 
Appeal.
 
Initially, we note that Palisade contests the 
jurisdiction of this court to consider Cabral's appeal because 
the appeal was not timely filed pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). 
Although Final Judgment was filed on April 22, 2009, 
Cabral appealed from the January 10, 2012 post-judgment order completely resolving the post-judgment proceeding initiated by 
Cabral's October 3, 2011 Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
post-judgment "Motion to Join Person As Party," (Motion) which the Circuit Court treated as a motion to intervene pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 24(a)(2). After a circuit court enters an appealable 
judgment, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order 
under [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] ยง 641-1(a) if the order 
ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be 
accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003). See also Hoopai v. Civil Service Comm'n, 106 
Hawai'i 205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 375 (2004) ("An order denying an 
application for intervention under HRCP Rule 24 is a final appealable order under HRS ยง 641-1(a)."). Thus, the January 10, 
2012 Order denying Cabral's Motion is an appealable final order.
 Cabral's notice of appeal was timely. Although filed
 
before the January 10, 2012 Order Denying Motion to Join Person 
As Party, Cabral's December 19, 2011 Notice of Appeal was filed
 
after the Circuit Court's November 30, 2011 announcement of its
 
decision to deny the Motion. HRAP Rule 4(a)(2). Palisade's
 
argument is without merit.
 
B. The Circuit Court Did Not Err When It Denied
 
Cabral's Motion to Intervene.
 
Although styled as a request for joinder, Cabral's
 
2
Motion  was more properly a motion to intervene under HRCP
2
 Cabral cited to HRCP Rule 28(a), "Persons Before Whom Depositions
May be Taken . . . . (a) Within the United States[;]" HRCP Rule 31(b)
(continued...)

Rule 24. W.H. Shipman, Ltd., 8 Haw. App. at 370, 802 P.2d at
 
1211.
 
A motion to intervene 
is reviewed under the right/wrong standard. This court
 
considers four factors in determining intervention as of
right pursuant to HRCP Rule 24(a)(2): (1) "whether the
application was timely"; (2) "whether the intervenor claimed
an interest relating to the property or transaction which
was the subject of the action"; (3) "whether the disposition
of the action would, as a practical matter, impair or impede
the intervenor's ability to protect that interest"; and (4)
"whether the intervenor's interest was inadequately
represented by the existing defendants."
 
Hoopai, 106 Hawai 'i at 216, 103 P.3d at 376 (citing Ing v. 
Acceptance Ins. Co., 76 Hawai 'i 266, 271, 874 P.2d 1091, 1096 
(1994)). "Failure to meet even one [factor] prevents 
intervention 'by right' under HRCP Rule 24(a)(2)." Baehr v. 
Miike, 80 Hawai 'i 341, 345, 910 P.2d 112, 116 (1996). 
Cabral fails to meet the first factor, that her Motion 
was timely. Hoopai
, 106 Hawai 'i at 216, 103 P.3d at 376. 
To determine whether the motion to intervene was timely, we
must consider the totality of circumstances, but especiallyrelevant is: (1) the lapse of time between when [applicantsfor intervention] should have sought intervention and whenit actually did; and (2) the prejudice caused to the[parties] by the lapse of time. 
Ing, 76 Hawai 'i at 271, 874 P.2d at 1096. "[M]otions to 
intervene filed after judgment has been entered are viewed with 
disfavor; and the moving party has a heavy burden to show facts 
or circumstances that justify intervention at that late date." 
Chierighino v. Bowers, 2 Haw. App. 291, 294, 631 P.2d 183, 186 
(1981) (denying a motion to intervene because it was filed more 
than two years after judgment and "there [were] no circumstances 
justifying any delay at all"). 
Upon the totality of the circumstances present here,
 
Cabral's attempt to intervene was untimely. Palisade filed its
 
2(...continued)
"Depositions Upon Written Questions . . . . (b) Officer to Take Responses and
Prepare Record[;]" and HRCP Rule 19(a), "Joinder of Persons Needed for Just
Adjudication." Although this last rule does concern joinder, "[i]ntervention
under HRCP Rule 24(a),[] not joinder under [this rule,] is the appropriate
procedure to be used by a nonparty to enter a case." W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v.
Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., 8 Haw. App. 354, 370, 802 P.2d 1203, 1211
(1990).

Complaint to Quiet Title on September 24, 1997. On or about
 
June 13, 2002, Cabral received a letter from Palisade's attorney
 
informing her that its Motion for Final Judgment and Decree had
 
been granted and that entry of said judgment was imminent, thus
 
resolving the quiet title litigation involving the real property
 
in which Cabral had an interest. On July 3, 2002, the Circuit
 
Court entered an Amended Final Judgment and Decree purporting to
 
resolve all claims against all parties. On April 22, 2009, the
 
Circuit Court entered a Supplemental Amended Final Judgment and
 
Decree. Cabral did not file her Motion until October 3, 2011. 
Cabral asserted no facts or circumstances in support of
 
her Motion or in her opening brief that justify late
 
intervention. In her Reply Brief, Cabral asserts for the first
 
time--without citation to the record in support--that she did not
 
attempt to intervene "until foreclosure proceedings were
 
instigated" because she "understood from [Palisade's attorney]
 
that there was no title report and no final survey." Cabral does
 
not explain why the lack of foreclosure proceedings justify her
 
late Motion. See Chierighino, 2 Haw. App. at 294, 631 P.2d at
 
186 (denying a motion to intervene because it was filed more than
 two years after judgment and "there [were] no circumstances
 
justifying any delay at all"). The Circuit Court did not err in
 
denying Cabral's Motion to Join. Because this fully resolves
 
Cabral's appeal, we need not address her other arguments.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Circuit Court of the Second
 
Circuit's January 10, 2012 Order Denying Motion to Join Person as
 
Party is affirmed.
