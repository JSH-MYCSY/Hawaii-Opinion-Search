IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SCOTT GORDON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1P111-10067)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J. and Fujise, J.,
with Reifurth, J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Scott Lee Gordon (Gordon) appeals
 
from the November 25, 2011 Judgment entered by the District Court
 
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1
 
Gordon was convicted of Theft in the Fourth Degree, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 708-833(1) (1993).
 
On appeal, Gordon contends (1) the District Court 
plainly erred by failing to dismiss the charge because of the 
failure to preserve video surveillance of Gordon, thereby 
violating his right to due process under the United States and 
Hawai'i Constitutions, (2) Gordon's right to testify was violated 
by an inadequate colloquy required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995) and State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai' i 
292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000), and (3) there was insufficient evidence 
to demonstrate that Gordon acted with the requisite mens rea.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Gordon's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The District Court did not plainly err by failing
 
to dismiss the charge due to unavailability of a surveillance
 
video. In State v. Matafeo , 71 Haw. 183, 185-86, 787 P.2d 671,
 
672 (1990), the court stated:
 
In Brady v. Maryland, the United States Supreme Court
held that the suppression by the prosecution of
evidence favorable to the accused violates due process
where the evidence is material to guilt or punishment,
regardless of the good faith or bad faith of the
prosecution. [373 U.S. 83, 87, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 218,
83 S. Ct. 1194, 1196 (1963)]. The Brady rule has been
incorporated into the Hawaii due process jurisprudence
and relied upon frequently by this court. See
 
generally State v. Estrada, 69 Haw. 204, 738 P.2d 812
(1987); State v. Arnold, 66 Haw. 175, 657 P.2d 1052
(1983); State v. Marzo, 64 Haw. 395, 641 P.2d 1338
(1982).
 
In this case, no surveillance video recording was given
 
to the State. Consequently, the State did not suppress any
 
evidence. Furthermore, Gordon's assertion that the video
 
surveillance footage was exculpatory or otherwise favorable to
 
him is not supported by the evidence presented to the District
 
Court. An asset protection coordinator employed by the
 
complainant testified that he reviewed the surveillance video
 
following Gordon's arrest in order to determine whether what was
 
being reported by the loss prevention officer was consistent with
 
the recording and that if the video surveillance footage was not
 
accurately reflected in the report he would have saved the video
 
at that time. The asset protection coordinator did not save the
 
video at that time.
 
(2) Gordon did not validly waive his right to testify 
because the District Court did not properly advise Gordon of his 
Tachibana rights or conduct a colloquy that involved a verbal 
exchange in which the District Court could ascertain Gordon's 
understanding of his rights. State v. Han, ___ Hawai' i ___, 306 
P.3d 128, SCWC-11-0000814, 2013 WL 3063769, at *1 (Haw. June 19, 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2013). In Han, the Supreme Court further clarified the colloquy
 
requirement under Tachibana and Lewis by noting,
 
"Colloquy" is defined as "[a]ny formal discussion, such as
an oral exchange between a judge, the prosecutor, the
defense counsel, and a criminal defendant in which the judge
ascertains the defendant's understanding of the proceedings
and of the defendant's rights." Black's Law Dictionary 300
 
(9th ed. 2009) (emphases added).
 
Id. at 135.
 
The District Court's pre-trial advisement was
 
inadequate under Lewis in that it failed to advise Gordon
 
regarding his right not to testify. The District Court merely
 
advised Gordon that he had an absolute right to testify, even if
 
it was against his attorney's advice.
 
The District Court did not comply with the requirements 
of Tachibana by engaging in a colloquy with Gordon that 
ascertained Gordon understood that he had a right to testify, 
that if he wanted to testify no one could prevent him from doing 
so, and that if he testifies the prosecution will be allowed to 
cross examine him. Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 
1303 n.7. In addition, the District Court failed to discuss Gordon's right not to testify at all. Id. The need for a proper 
Tachibana advisement and colloquy was especially important in light of the abrupt change of heart regarding his decision on 
whether to testify. 
Contrary to the State's assertion, the failure to
 
properly advise Gordon of his Tachibana rights and to conduct an
 
adequate colloquy was not harmless error.
 
"The relevant question under the harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt standard is 'whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed toconviction.'" State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawai' i 432, 450, 279
P.3d 1237, 1255 (2012) (quoting State v. Duncan, 101 Hawai' i 
269, 278, 67 P.3d 768, 777 (2003)) (emphases in original).As stated, the ICA observed in Hoang that, "it is inherentlydifficult, if not impossible, to divine what effect aviolation of the defendant's constitutional right to testifyhad on the outcome of any particular case," [State v. Hoang,94 Hawai' i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (2000) (citing State
v. Silva, 78 Hawai' i 115, 126, 890 P.2d 702, 713 (App.
1995))], and thus the burden rests on the State to establish"the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 240, 990 P.2d at 1307. 
Han at 138.

Here, Gordon's defense challenged the credibility of
 
the State's main witness, the store's loss prevention officer,
 
and the fact that when Gordon was apprehended, no property
 
belonging to the store was found on his person. In Han, the
 
court found that the failure to obtain a knowing, intelligent,
 
and voluntary waiver of a defendant's right to testify was not
 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because there was no way of
 
assessing the effect of defendant's testimony on the jury's
 
credibility determination. Similarly here, had Gordon testified
 
it would be impossible to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that
 
his testimony could not have created a reasonable doubt in the
 
mind of the factfinder or that the error could not have
 
contributed to his conviction based on the credibility of the
 
witness testimony presented at trial. Id. 
(3) When the evidence is considered in the strongest 
light for the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 
157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), there was sufficient 
evidence that Gordon acted with the requisite mens rea in order 
to convict him of Theft in the Fourth Degree. Gordon admits 
there was evidence of his "criminal mens rea," although he 
maintains it was "very slight circumstantial evidence." 
The loss prevention officer, Cecelia Reeves (Reeves)
 
testified that another male and Gordon went to the electronics
 
department where Gordon initially attempted to pull an earphone
 
device off of a locked peg. However, Gordon later returned with
 
another male to the electronics department twenty minutes later, 
pulled a packaged "Scandisk" from a peg, and later handed the
 
item to another male. Reeves stated that customers require
 
assistance to remove items from a peg. Reeves also testified
 
that at some point while they were in the store, the other male
 
tore open the packaging and placed the "Scandisk" into his pants
 
pocket. Both Gordon and the other male then walked past open
 
registers toward an emergency exit on Sheridan Street, the other
 
male exited but Gordon came back into the store before exiting on
 
Keeaumoku Street. The District Court found Gordon guilty

pursuant to HRS ยง 702-222(1)(b) because Gordon aided or agreed or
 
attempted to aid another person in planning or committing an
 
offense.
 
"[G]iven the difficulty of proving the requisite state 
of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, 'we have 
consistently held that . . . proof by circumstantial evidence and 
reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the 
[defendant's conduct] is sufficient. . . . Thus, the mind of an 
alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and 
inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances.'" State v. 
Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (quoting 
State v. Sadino, 64 Haw. 427, 430, 642 P.2d 534, 536-37 (1982)). 
Gordon's acts, conduct and the inferences fairly drawn from all 
of the circumstances support the finding that Gordon acted with 
the requisite state of mind to be convicted of Theft in the 
Fourth Degree as an accomplice. 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment entered on
 
November 25, 2011 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division is vacated and the case is remanded for a new
 
trial.
