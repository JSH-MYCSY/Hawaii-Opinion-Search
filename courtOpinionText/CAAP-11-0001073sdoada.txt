NO. CAAP-11-0001073
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RAYMOND GONSALVES, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAI'ANAE DIVISION
 
(Case Nos. 1DTI-06-012226 and 1DTI-07-109698)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Pro se Defendant-Appellant Raymond Gonsalves, Jr.,
 
(Gonsalves) appeals from the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
1
Wai'anae Division's (District Court)  December 12, 2011 order
denying Gonsalves's Motion to Dismiss All Charges With Prejudice 
Case Nos. 1DTI-07-109698 and 1DTI-06-012226 (Motion to Dismiss). 
On appeal, Gonsalves appears to argue that the District

 
Court erred because: (1) it violated his right, under the Sixth
 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to confront adverse
 
witnesses; (2) it violated his right, under the Fifth or Sixth
 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to be represented by counsel;
 
(3) it violated his right, under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S.
 
Constitution, to a public trial by an impartial jury; and (4) it
 
failed to dismiss the case for unnecessary delay.

Based on a careful review of the issues raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 
authority, we resolve Gonsalves's appeal as follows:
 
Initially we consider whether we have jurisdiction to
 
consider Gonsalves's appeal. In District Court case number 1DTI­
07-109698, no judgment appears in the record. Therefore, the
 
citation in District Court case number 1DTI-07-109698 appears to
 
still be pending before the District Court. Gonsalves cannot
 
invoke this court's appellate jurisdiction to review any orders
 
in District Court case number 1DTI-07-109698 until the District
 
Court enters an appealable final order or judgment that ends the
 
proceedings in District Court case number 1DTI-07-109698, as
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2013) requires for
 
appealability.
 
By contrast, default judgment was entered in District 
Court case number 1DTI-06-012226. However, Gonsalves did not 
appeal from this July 25, 2007 default judgment. Instead, on 
December 20, 2011, Gonsalves timely appealed from the 
December 12, 2011 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss (Order), 
finally disposing of his Motion to Dismiss in both District Court 
case numbers 1DTI-06-012226 and 1DTI-07-109698. The Order is, in 
a literal sense, a post-judgment order as to District Court 
number 1DTI-06-012226 and finally disposed of Gonsalves's Motion 
to Dismiss. See Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 
426, 984 P.2d 1251, 1252 (1999) ("When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and 
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be 
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and 
appealable.") Thus, we have jurisdiction to consider Gonsalves's 
appeal from the Order as to District Court case number 1DTI-06­
012226. 
We conclude that the District Court properly denied 
Gonsalves's motion to dismiss. Hawai
'i Civil Traffic Rules 
(HCTR) Rule 18 provides that "[n]o post judgment request for relief will be allowed except for a motion to set aside default

judgment, motion to convert monetary assessment to community 
service, motion to amend judgment, or a request for trial after a 
contested hearing." Even looking at the substance of Gonsalves's 
motion rather than its title, Anderson v. Oceanic Props., Inc., 3 
Haw. App. 350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617 (1982) ("it is the 
substance of the pleadings that controls, not its nomenclature"), 
we cannot say that his Motion to Dismiss invoked any of the types 
of relief provided for in HCTR Rule 18. Rather, for the various 
reasons he stated, he sought a dismissal with prejudice of these 
traffic infraction cases. Thus, Gonsalves's motion was 
unauthorized and the District Court correctly denied the motion. 
See State v. Ranger Ins. Co., 83 Hawai 'i 118, 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 
288, 294 n.5 (1996) (in construing bail bond forfeiture statute noting that the trial court was "without power to consider" a 
motion filed after the statutorily defined deadline.) 
Therefore, we affirm the District Court of the First 
Circuit, Wai
'anae Division's December 12, 2011 Order Denying 
Motion to Dismiss as to District Court case number 1DTI-06­012226. We dismiss Gonsalves's appeal as to District Court case 
number 1DTI-07-109698.
