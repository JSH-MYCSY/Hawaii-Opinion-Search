IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
SANDRA C.J. BALOGH, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DONALD RAYMOND BALOGH, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 10-1-0149)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
  
(By: Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ., with
Foley, Presiding Judge, concurring separately)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Sandra C.J. Balogh ("Wife") appeals
 
from the December 2, 2011 Divorce Decree ("Decree") and the
 
February 15, 2012 Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law entered
 
1
in the Family Court of the First Circuit  ("Family Court").  The
 
Family Court dissolved Wife's marriage to Defendant-Appellee
 Donald Raymond Balogh ("Husband") and divided and distributed the
 parties' property pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") §
 580-47 (2006 Repl.). 
I. BACKGROUND
 
The parties married on June 19, 1981 in New Jersey. 
After moving to Oahu in October 2003, the couple began
 constructing a home on a vacant lot they had purchased at
 Kahalakua Street ("Property"). 
The parties held title to the
 
Property as tenants by the entirety.

 The Honorable Paul T. Murakami presided over the portion of the
proceedings relevant to this appeal. 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On October 6, 2008, following a period of tension
 
between the parties, Husband handwrote a document stating that if
 
the couple separated, Wife would receive 75% of the sale proceeds
 from the Property, the contents of their home excluding Husband's
 clothing and tools, and all vehicles. Both parties signed this
 agreement. On October 24, 2008, Wife prepared a typewritten Memo
 of Understanding ("MOU") stating the above terms and adding that
 Wife would receive $100,000 in cash from Husband in lieu of
 alimony and court proceedings. The parties intended that the MOU
 would supersede the October 6, 2008 agreement. The parties
 signed the MOU before a notary public. 
On August 15, 2009, Husband agreed to leave their home
 
because of the ongoing tension. On September 1, 2009, Husband
 signed a quitclaim deed stating that Husband transferred his
 
2
interest in the Property to Wife as tenant in severalty  in
consideration of $10. At the time, Husband had already moved out
 of the Property. He met with Wife to execute the deed before a
 notary public. 
Wife filed a complaint for divorce on January 14, 2010. 
On August 16, 2011, the Family Court orally ruled in pertinent
 part that it was awarding each party a one-half interest in the
 Property, notwithstanding the quitclaim deed, and the court set
 the value of the Property at $1.6 million. 
The Decree, entered
 
December 2, 2011, reflected the Family Court's oral ruling
 regarding the Property. The Family Court entered its findings of
 fact and conclusions of law ("COLs") on February 15, 2012 with
 the following pertinent COLs:
 
N. After thirty years of marriage, the Court concludes
it would be unconscionable to award [Wife] the [Property] by
enforcing the Quitclaim Deed. Kuroda v. Kuroda, 87 
[Hawai'i] 419, 958 P.2d 541 ([App.] 1998); and Lewis v.
Lewis, 69 Haw. 497, 748 P.2d 1362 (1988). 
O. Further, after considering their testimony, the
Court finds that the parties were motivated to save the
marriage when they signed the various agreements. When
 [Husband] signed the Quitclaim Deed, [Husband] was
protecting their marital home from potential lawsuits and
had no intent of permanently transferring his interest to

jointly with another person. B LACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1604 (9th ed. 2009).
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Wife]. Neither party intended their marriage to result in
a divorce and to divide their marital estate accordingly.
 
P. The Court finds [Husband] was suffering from
extreme distress as a result of the ongoing construction oftheir [Property], the contractor's walk-off and lawsuit in2006, the penalties assessed by [The Association of Ownersof Kahala Kua ("AOAO")] and parties' lawsuit against AOAO,his high security clearance job which also requiredtwenty-four hour/seven days on call one week a month, thecontinuing issues with the subcontractors, and hisuncontrollable obsessive behavior that escalated from his backyard nudity to public display, his shame andembarrassment, his fear of being discovered, and theconstant argument with [Wife] about his inappropriatebehavior. At the same time, [Wife] suspected him ofinfidelity which further exacerbated the maritalrelationship and escalated the tension and the friction intheir home. [Husband] was thus under duress and coercionwhen he signed the agreements. Prell v. Silverstein, 114 
[Hawai'i] 286, 162 P.3d 2 ([App.] 2007). 
Q. Therefore, the Court concludes that the parties'
agreements on October 6, 2008, October 24, 2008, and
September 1, 2009, are not enforceable.
 
R. Accordingly, each party shall be awarded
fifty-percent (50%) interest in their [Property]. The
parties may sell said property and divide the net sales
proceeds equally or [Wife] may buy out [Husband's] interest
for the amount of Eight Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($800,000.00). Said provision shall take place within 90
days of the effective date of the Divorce Decree.
 
S. In making these orders, the Court has considered
the relevant factors pursuant to HRS §580-47 and said orders
are just and equitable.
 
On appeal, Wife challenges the above COLs and the
 
Family Court's disposition of the Property. Wife also challenges
 
the Family Court's factual findings that (1) Wife told Husband he
 should leave on August 15, 2009, and (2) Husband thought the
 quitclaim deed would protect the Property from potential lawsuits
 but believed title would eventually be transferred back to joint
 ownership. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decision[s] will not be
set aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. 
Thus, [an appellate court] will not disturb the family
court's decisions on appeal unless the family court
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.

Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and
is freely reviewable for its correctness. [An
appellate] court ordinarily reviews COLs under the
right/wrong standard. Thus, a COL that is supported
by the trial court's FOFs and that reflects an
application of the correct rule of law will not be
overturned. However, a COL that presents mixed
questions of fact and law is reviewed under the
clearly erroneous standard because the court's
conclusions are dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of each individual case.

(App. 2009). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
"All contracts made between spouses, whenever made 
. . . and not otherwise invalid because of any other law, shall 
be valid." H AW. REV. STAT. § 572-22 (2006). During-the-marriage 
agreements are permissible whether or not made in contemplation of divorce. Epp v. Epp, 80 Hawai' i 79, 84, 905 P.2d 54, 59 (App. 
1995). In divorce cases, the family court must enforce all valid and enforceable marital agreements, Epp, 80 Hawai' i at 88, 905 
P.2d at 63, and property that has been excluded from the marital partnership by a valid contract is not subject to division by the family court. Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 126, 142, 276 
P.3d 695, 711 (2012). 
A marital agreement may be unenforceable under contract
 
law if there is "1) the absence of true assent to the agreement
 due to duress, coercion, undue influence, or any other
 circumstance indicating that [a party] did not freely and
 voluntarily enter into the agreement; and 2) unconscionability." 
Lewis v. Lewis, 69 Haw. 497, 501, 748 P.2d 1362, 1366 (1988). A
 contract that is merely inequitable is not unenforceable under
 contract law, nor can it be said that enforcement of inequitable
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreements violates public policy. Id. at 500 n.1, 748 P.2d at
 
1366 n.1.
 
In this case, the Family Court concluded Husband signed
 
the October 6, 2008 agreement, the October 24, 2008 MOU, and the
 
September 1, 2009 quitclaim deed under duress and coercion. The
 Family Court also concluded that the quitclaim deed was
 unconscionable. Consequently, it determined that all three
 agreements were unenforceable. We agree with Wife that the
 Family Court erred with regard to the agreements' enforceability,
 and we conclude that the MOU and the deed should be enforced
 against Husband.
 
A. Unconscionability
 
As derived from the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC"), 
unconscionability of a marital agreement encompasses two basic 
principles: one-sidedness and unfair surprise. Lewis, 69 Haw. at 
502, 748 P.2d at 1366; Chen v. Hoeflinger, 127 Hawai' i 346, 357, 
279 P.3d 11, 22 (App. 2012); Prell v. Silverstein, 114 Hawai' i 
286, 297, 162 P.3d 2, 13 (App. 2007). One-sidedness means that the agreement leaves a post-divorce economic situation that is unjustly disproportionate; unfair surprise means that one party did not have full and adequate knowledge of the other party's financial condition when the agreement was executed. Lewis, 69 
Haw. at 502, 748 P.2d at 1366. 
In Kuroda v. Kuroda, 87 Hawai' i 419, 958 P.2d 541 (App. 
1998), this court ruled that a marital agreement made in contemplation of divorce was unconscionable and apparently based its ruling on a determination of one-sidedness alone. The agreement had been entered into in 1975 and wife sought to enforce it when husband filed for divorce more than seventeen years later in 1993. The agreement was held to be unconscionable because it provided that the wife would be entitled to all personal property and all real property, implicitly allowed the wife to keep all her personal property and accounts, required the husband to pay wife one-half of his net income from every source (including retirement fund and royalties) after taxes until either wife or husband died, and required husband to pay all 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and court costs related to all divorce and
 
separation proceedings. Id. at 428, 958 P.2d at 550. Thus,
 
under Kuroda, there need not be both one-sidedness and unfair
 surprise in reaching a determination that a marital agreement is
 unconscionable. The circumstances in Kuroda, however, were quite
 exceptional.
 
One-sidedness is often referred to as "substantive" 
unconscionability and unfair surprise is often referred to as "procedural" unconscionability. See J
OSEPH M. PERILLO, CALAMARI AND 
PERILLO ON CONTRACTS § 9.37, at 332 (6th ed. 2009). "Most cases of 
unconscionability involve a combination of procedural and substantive unconscionability, and it is generally agreed that if more of one is present, then less of the other is required." 1 F
ARNSWORTH ON CONTRACTS § 4.28, at 585 (3d ed. 2004). "A court will 
weigh all elements of both substantive and procedural unconscionability and may conclude that the contract is unconscionable because of the overall imbalance." Id. "Some 
cases hold that the defense of unconscionability cannot be invoked unless the contract or clause is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, but there is no basis in the text of [UCC § 2-302] for such a conclusion, and cases of purely substantive unconscionability exist." P
ERILLO, supra, § 9.37, at 
332 (footnote omitted); see, e.g., Kuroda, 87 Hawai' i at 428, 958 
P.2d at 550. Nevertheless, as noted above, we believe that it is the "exceptional case[] where a provision of the contract is so outrageous as to warrant holding it unenforceable on the ground of substantive unconscionability alone." See Gillman v. Chase 
Manhattan Bank, N.A., 534 N.E.2d 824, 829 (N.Y. 1988). 
Here, as the concurrence notes, nothing in the record
 
indicates unfair surprise. Husband was involved in all stages of
 the Property's purchase and construction. At trial and on
 appeal, Husband did not assert that Wife concealed or
 misrepresented any material facts. The Family Court did not make
 any findings indicating that Husband was unaware of Wife's
 financial condition or the Property's value, and nothing in the
 record supports such a finding. Indeed, Husband's contention in
 his answering brief that "it appears [he] was unaware that Wife
 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
had about $500,000 in retirement, not including her New Jersey
 
pension" is not supported by the record to which he cites.
 
Furthermore, we hold that this is not an exceptional
 
case where the agreement was so one-sided that it is
 unconscionable even without a showing of unfair surprise. It is
 true that on September 1, 2009, Husband signed a quitclaim deed
 transferring his interest in the Property to Wife for $10. This
 fact alone might suggest that the gross disparity between the
 value of the Property and price is itself unconscionable. Cf.
 
R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 208 cmt. c (1981) ("Inadequacy of
 
consideration does not of itself invalidate a bargain, but gross
 disparity in the values exchanged may be an important factor in a
 determination that a contract is unconscionable . . . ."). 
However, here, the quitclaim deed is not so 
outrageously oppressive as to be unconscionable in the absence of unfair surprise. The Family Court found that Husband quitclaimed his interest in the Property to Wife for the specific purposes of both protecting it from potential judgment creditors and to show further commitment to the marriage. Indeed, the legal transfer of the Property to Wife for a de minimis fee was the entire point of the transaction from Husband's standpoint — certainly not the recovery of a $10 purchase price. The fact that Husband's (perhaps shortsighted) decision to quitclaim his interest to Wife ultimately turned out to be a bad one from his perspective is irrelevant and does not warrant invalidating the quitclaim deed. Chen, 127 Hawai' i at 357, 279 P.3d at 22 ("[T]he issue of 
unconscionability of a provision governing division of property . . . should be evaluated at the time the agreement was executed."). 
Furthermore, this case is unlike Kuroda because here
 
the parties separately agreed to an equitable distribution of
 their retirement and securities accounts, which had a combined
 worth of about $760,000. Moreover, unlike in Kuroda, Husband
 need not pay wife any portion of his income in the future.
3 Only

 We also note that, under the October 24, 2008 MOU, Husband agreed to
pay Wife $100,000 "in lieu of [a]limony and court proceedings," but Wife
thereafter initiated court proceedings by filing the Complaint for Divorce in
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
in exceptional cases, with facts not present here, is a contract
 
so oppressive that it is unconscionable without any showing of
 unfair surprise. Therefore, the Family Court erred in concluding
 the quitclaim deed was unconscionable.
 
B. Voluntariness
 
"Involuntariness is shown by evidence of duress, 
coercion, undue influence, or any other circumstance indicating 
lack of free will or voluntariness." Chen, 127 Hawai' i at 357, 
279 P.3d at 22 (quoting Prell, 114 Hawai' i at 298, 162 P.3d at 
14) (internal quotation marks omitted). A contract is voidable under the doctrine of duress "[i]f a party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative[.]" Standard Fin. 
Co. v. Ellis, 3 Haw. App. 614, 621, 657 P.2d 1056, 1061 (1983) (quoting R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 175(1) (1981)). 
Here, Husband testified that Wife did not threaten
 
divorce or exposure of his inappropriate behavior, and there is
 nothing in the record showing that Wife used threats or any other
 improper methods of persuasion. Moreover, a threat of divorce,
 even if adequately proven, does not amount to duress because the
 threatened act is lawful. See Kam Chin Chun Ming v. Kam Hee Ho,
 
45 Haw. 521, 558, 371 P.2d 379, 402 (1962) (stating that a threat
 to exercise a legal right does not constitute duress); see also
 Rubenstein v. Sela, 672 P.2d 492, 494 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1983);
 Autin v. Autin, 617 So. 2d 229, 233 (La. Ct. App. 1993) (holding
 that threats to leave marriage did not constitute duress). Based
 on the uncontroverted evidence of Wife's conduct, we conclude
 that the circumstances described in the Family Court's findings
 of fact and COLs do not rise to a level of duress or coercion
 that negated Husband's free will. 
Furthermore, the record indicates that Husband freely
 
and voluntarily entered into the agreements. Both parties had
 advanced degrees and were capable of understanding the
 agreements' terms. After signing the October 6, 2008 agreement,
 
this case. Thus, on remand the Family Court should determine whether Husband
owes Wife the $100,000 under the MOU.
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Husband had adequate opportunity to consider the terms and seek
 
counsel. He subsequently exercised his free will by signing and
 having notarized the October 24, 2008 MOU, replacing the
 October 6, 2008 agreement, and the September 1, 2009 quitclaim
 deed to the Property. Until the divorce proceedings commenced,
 Husband did not attempt to revoke any of the agreements and made
 no indication that he had acted against his will. We conclude
 that Husband executed the agreements voluntarily, and the Family
 Court erred in failing to enforce the MOU and the deed. 
Husband also attempted to attack the quitclaim deed by
 
testifying that the parties intended to shelter the Property from
 potential lawsuits and claiming that he never intended to convey
 his interest. However, Husband's statements regarding intent
 were inadmissible for purposes of contradicting the deed's clear
 language, under which he granted his interest in the Property to
 Wife as tenant in severalty. A quitclaim deed is sufficient to
 transfer all interest which the grantor possesses. Hustace v.
 
Kapuni, 6 Haw. App. 241, 245, 718 P.2d 1109, 1112 (1986);
 Christian v. Waialua Agricultural Co., 35 Haw. 352, 373 (Haw.
 Terr. 1940). When a deed is unambiguous, as it is in this case, 
"extrinsic evidence of the surrounding facts and circumstances
 existing prior to, contemporaneously with and subsequent to the
 execution of the deed . . . is not competent to contradict,
 defeat, modify or otherwise vary the meaning or legal effect of
 the deed." Midkiff v. Castle & Cooke, Inc., 45 Haw. 409, 421,
 
368 P.2d 887, 894 (1962). The Family Court erred in failing to
 classify the Property as Wife's separate property pursuant to the
 plain language of the deed.
 
We further conclude that the quitclaim deed supersedes 
the MOU only to the extent that it modifies the MOU's disposition of the Property. "[A] modification of a contract is a change in one or more respects which introduces new elements into the details of the contract and cancels others but leaves the general purpose and effect undisturbed." Shanghai Inv. Co. v. Alteka 
Co., 92 Hawai' i 482, 497, 993 P.2d 516, 531 (2000) (quoting Int'l 
Bus. Lists, Inc. v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co. 147 F.3D 636, 641 (7th Cir. 1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted), overruled on 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
other grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai' i 327, 31 P.3d 184 
(2001). "The original contract generally remains in force except 
as modified or superseded by the new agreement." Id. (quoting 
Scott v. Majors, 980 P.2d 214, 218 (Utah App. 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The quitclaim deed is a valid and enforceable modification of the MOU's provisions regarding the Property and does not otherwise conflict with the MOU. 
We need not address Wife's remaining points of error
 
challenging the Family Court's factual findings because, even
 assuming that the Family Court did not clearly err in its factual
 findings, we conclude that the agreements were enforceable.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate paragraph 4 of the
 
December 2, 2011 Divorce Decree and the February 15, 2012
 
Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law and remand for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion.
