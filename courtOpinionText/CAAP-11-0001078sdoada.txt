NO. CAAP-11-0001078
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ANTHONY SANTIAGO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-1319)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Anthony Santiago (Santiago) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered on
 
November 29, 2011 by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1 Santiago was convicted of one count of Robbery
 
in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 708-841 (Supp. 2012), and one count of Assault in the
 
First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-710 (1993). Santiago was
 
sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years for each count.
 
On appeal, Santiago argues two main points. 
First, he
 
argues that the Circuit Court failed to specifically instruct the
 
jury that its verdict must be unanimous as to the elements of
 
each count of the Complaint. Second, he argues that, by
 
instructing with regard to his co-defendant's charge, strictly as

an accomplice to robbery the Circuit Court violated his due
 
process rights by, in effect, adopting the testimony of some
 
witnesses and rejecting Santiago's testimony.
 
1. The Circuit Court did not plainly err when it did
 
not include a specific unanimity instruction directing the jury
 
that it must unanimously agree on the acts and/or injury
 
corresponding to each count. The prosecution presented evidence
 
of one criminal episode and charged two separate crimes; this

does not require an Arceo  unanimity instruction. State v. 
Kassebeer, 118 Hawai' i 493, 508, 193 P.3d 409, 424 (2008) citing 
State v. Valentine, 93 Hawai' i 199, 208, 998 P2d 479, 488 (2000) 
(two preconditions for an Arceo unanimity instruction are proof 
of two or more separate and distinct culpable acts and submission 
to the jury that only one offense was committed). 
2. The Circuit Court did not plainly err when it
 
instructed the jury as to Kaulana Akau (Akau) solely as an
 
accomplice. Santiago argues that the Circuit Court "improperly
 
limited the jury's focus" by appearing to adopt the State's
 
version of the facts by instructing the jury as to Akau only as
 
an accomplice. Santiago argues that the Circuit Court's
 
instruction caused the jury to reject any evidence that Akau was
 
the actual perpetrator. The indictment against Akau was for one
 
count of Accomplice to Robbery in the First Degree, in violation
 
of HRS §§ 702-221(2)(c), 702-222(1)(b), and 708-840(1)(a). 
Santiago does not provide authority for the proposition that it
 
was a comment on the evidence to limit instructions to the
 
specific charge, nor does he present authority for the
 
proposition that it was plain error when the Circuit Court failed

to, sua sponte, advance Santiago's alternate defense theory of
 
the case via jury instruction.
 
Therefore, the November 29, 2011 Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 
affirmed.
