JOYCELYN WANDA UNCIANO, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
GMAC MORTGAGE, LLC, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LAND COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
(1L.D. CASE NO. 11-1-2518; APPLICATION NO. 1069)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Petitioner-Appellant Joycelynn Wanda Unciano's 
(Appellant Unciano) appeal from the Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's November 28, 2011, "Order Denying Petition of Joycelyn Wanda Unciano to Cancel Land Court Order 18675 and Amendment of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 546,739, Filed August 4, 2011" (the November 28, 2011 order), because the land court has not yet reduced the November 28, 2012 order to a separate judgment or decree, as Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
requires under the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees 
of the land court to the intermediate court of appeals. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure apply to "[p]roceedings in the land court under chapter 501[.]" HRCP Rule 81(b)(1). The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
adopted HRCP Rule 58, which requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." (Emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. A judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP 
Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "Accordingly, an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and County of 
Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation 
omitted; emphasis added). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed."

Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
In land court, sometimes the land court refers to the final 
separate document as a decree rather than a judgment. See, e.g., 
Price v. Magoon, 75 Haw. 164, 179, 858 P.2d 712, 720 (1993) ("The final decree of the land court constitutes the final judgment in a land court action and is akin to a final judgment in a civil case."). 
The land court has not reduced the November 28, 2011
 
order to a separate judgment or decree that either enters
 judgment on all claims or contains an express finding of no just
 reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but
 fewer than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). On
 February 16, 2012, the record on appeal for appellate court case
 number CAAP-11-0001080 was filed, at which time the record did
 not contain a final judgment or final decree. Absent a separate
 appealable judgment or decree, Appellant Unciano's appeal is
 premature and we lack jurisdiction. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-11-0001080 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
