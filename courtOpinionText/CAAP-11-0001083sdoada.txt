NO. CAAP-11-0001083
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
BRISON PALENCIA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-0114)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Brison Palencia (Palencia) appeals
 
from the Order of Resentencing entered December 7, 2011 in the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court) revoking his
probation and re-sentencing him to imprisonment.
 
On January 28, 2009, Palencia was indicted for sexual
 
assault in the first degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-730 (Supp. 2012). 
Palencia pleaded guilty
 
to the included offense of sexual assault in the second degree in
 violation of HRS ยง 707-731(1)(a) (Supp. 2012). On 
1
 The Honorable Steven S. Alm presided over the revocation
proceeding.

August 17, 2009, the circuit court entered a judgment of
 
conviction and sentenced Palencia to probation of a term of five
 
years.2
 
On October 4, 2011, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i 
(State) filed a motion to revoke Palencia's probation. On 
December 7, 2011, the circuit court granted the State's motion 
and re-sentenced Palencia to the maximum term of imprisonment of 
ten years. On December 23, 2011, Palencia filed a notice of 
appeal. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Palencia's appeal is without merit.
 
HRS ยง 706-625(3) (Supp. 2012) provides that "[t]he 
court shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably 
failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a 
condition of the order or has been convicted of a felony." "The 
circuit court's decision that [the defendant] failed to comply 
with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the 
order of probation is a finding of fact. A finding of fact is 
reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard[.]" State v. 
Reyes, 93 Hawai' i 321, 327, 2 P.3d 725, 731 (App. 2000) 
(citations omitted). "A finding of fact is clearly erroneous 
when (1) the records lacks substantial evidence to support the 
finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the 
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite 
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." State v. 
Locquiao, 100 Hawai' i 195, 203, P.3d 1242, 1250 (2002) (quoting 
State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai' i 383, 392 894 P.2d 80, 89 (1995)).

 The circuit court entered a second amended judgment on August 24,
2009 that was essentially identical to the August 17, 2009 judgment.

"The decision that the failure was inexcusable is a conclusion of 
law. A conclusion of law is reviewed de novo under the 
right/wrong standard. A conclusion of law that is supported by 
the trial court's findings of fact and that reflects an 
application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." 
Reyes, 93 Hawai' i at 327, 2 P.3d at 731 (citations and brackets 
omitted). 
Substantial evidence existed to support the circuit
 
court's finding that Palencia violated the conditions of his
 
3
probation that prohibited contact with minors  and required him
to participate satisfactorily in the sex offender treatment
 program until clinically discharged with the concurrence of the
 
probation officer.
 
The terms of conditions requiring Palencia to
 
participate satisfactorily in the sex offender treatment program
 
and prohibiting contact with minors were crucial to his
 
rehabilitation and necessary for the protection of the public. 
Violating these conditions was not excusable. 
The circuit
 
court's findings that Palencia lied, was frequently late to group
 sessions, lacked motivation to address his problems, and was not
 
reporting accurately his compliance with his medication regimen 
supported the court's conclusion that Palencia's failure to
 
participate satisfactorily in the sex offender treatment program
 
was inexcusable. The circuit court's findings that Palencia had
 
contact with a minor and then lied about it supported the court's
 
conclusion that Palencia inexcusably violated the condition of
 
probation prohibiting contact with minors.
 
Therefore,
 
3
 Palencia was prohibited from "associating with or being in the
presence of minors without the prior authorization of [his] probation
officer."
