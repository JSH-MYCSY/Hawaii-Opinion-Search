IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
BRUCE A. FRANK, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 11-1-008K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
  
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Petitioner-Appellant Bruce A. Frank's 
(Appellant Frank) appeal from the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's December 2, 2011 "Order Setting Hearing to Set Restitution Payments" (the December 2, 2011 interlocutory order) in S.P.P. No. 11-1-008K, because the December 2, 2011 interlocutory order is not an appealable final judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), Rule 40(h) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), and 
the holding in Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai' i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 
937, 940 (1995). 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai' i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "In a circuit court criminal case, a defendant may appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, see HRS § 641-11 (1993), from a certified interlocutory order, see HRS § 641-17 (1993), or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy." State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai' i 
309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (citation omitted). Therefore, pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2011) and "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made 
from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori, 79 Hawai' i at 13, 897 P.2d at 
940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet
 
entered a final judgment or final order that resolves all of the
 issues raised in Appellant Frank's HRPP Rule 40 petition for
 post-conviction relief. The December 2, 2011 interlocutory order
 resolves some, but not all, of the issues raised in Appellant
 Frank's HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief. 
According to the language of the December 2, 2011 interlocutory
 order, the circuit court intends to determine the manner in which
 Appellant Frank must pay the restitution portion of the sentence
 that the circuit court imposed against Appellant Frank in a
 September 26, 2000 judgment of conviction in Criminal No. 98­252K, but the record in S.P.P. No. 11-1-008K shows that the
 circuit court has not yet made this determination. Therefore,
 the December 2, 2011 interlocutory order is not appealable
 pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and HRPP Rule 40(h). Appellant Frank's
 appeal from the December 2, 2011 interlocutory order is
 premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appeal is dismissed for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction without prejudice to Appellant Frank
 asserting a timely appeal from a future final judgment or final
 order that resolves the final remaining issue in his HRPP Rule 40
 petition for post-conviction relief in S.P.P. No. 11-1-008K.
