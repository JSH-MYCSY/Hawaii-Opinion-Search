SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant William S. Ellis, Jr. (Ellis),
 
appearing pro se, appeals from the following judgments filed in
 
t
he Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court):1 (1)
 
"Partial Final Judgment in Favor of Plaintiffs," which was filed
 
on September, 16, 2011; and (2) "Final Judgment Dismissing Cross-
Claim Against Defendants Barbara A. Sumida, et al., filed by
 [Ellis] on April 28, 2011, or in the Alternative, For Summary
 Judgment" (Judgment Dismissing Cross-Claim), which was filed on
 October 13, 2011. The "Partial Final Judgment in Favor of
 Plaintiffs" dismissed Ellis's counterclaim against PlaintiffsÂ­

Appellees Bryan Funia, Cynthia J. Funai, and BG Incorporated
 
(collectively, "Plaintiffs"). The Judgment Dismissing Cross-
Claim dismissed Ellis's cross-claim against Defendants-Appellees
 Barbara A. Sumida, Stanley Unten, Tamae S. Shiraishi, and Debra
 Shiraishi-Pratt, in their respective capacities (collectively,
 "SUS Defendants").
 
On appeal, Ellis argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
dismissing his counterclaim against Plaintiffs and his cross-
claim against the SUS Defendants.
2 We conclude that Ellis's
 
arguments are without merit. 
At the outset, we note that Ellis's (1) counterclaim
 
against Plaintiffs for abuse of process and (2) his counterclaim
 
against Plaintiffs and cross-claim against the SUS Defendants for
 
conspiracy to abuse process are based on alleged abuse of process
 
arising out of lawsuits filed by Plaintiffs against P.F. Three
 
Partners (PF3), a limited partnership. Ellis is not an attorney,
 
and he cannot represent the interests of PF3.3 See In re Ellis,
 
55 Haw. 458, 460, 522 P.2d 460, 462 (1974) ("There can be, and
 is, no doubt that Mr. Ellis has openly and continually ignored
 
the order of this Court, dated September 23, 1971, enjoining him
 
from the further unauthorized practice of law.")  Ellis lacks
 
standing to raise claims asserting injury or damage to PF3.
 
To the extent that Ellis seeks to assert claims of
 
injury or damage to himself, we conclude that the Circuit Court
 
properly dismissed Ellis's counterclaim and cross-claim pursuant
 to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) (2000) for
 failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The
 Circuit Court properly dismissed Ellis's counterclaim against
 Plaintiffs for abuse of process because Ellis failed to allege
 
2
 Ellis filed a counterclaim against Plaintiffs for abuse of process as
well as a two-count counterclaim against Plaintiffs and cross-claim against
the SUS Defendants for conspiracy to abuse process (Count 1) and "conspiracy
for interference with and breach of SUS settlement" (Count 2). 
3
 Indeed, the SUS Defendants assert that PF3 has been represented by its
own lawyer during the proceedings.

"'a wilful act in the use of process which is not proper in the 
regular conduct of the proceeding.'" Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 
119 Hawai' i 403, 412, 198 P.3d 666, 675 (2008) (citation 
omitted). Because Ellis did not validly state a counterclaim for abuse of process against Plaintiffs, his counterclaim against Plaintiffs and cross-claim against the SUS Defendants for conspiracy to abuse process likewise failed to state a claim for relief. 
The Circuit Court properly dismissed Ellis's 
counterclaim against Plaintiffs and cross-claim against the SUS Defendants for "Conspiracy for Interference with and Breach of the SUS Settlement" because Ellis failed to allege facts that would show that the SUS Defendants breached their settlement agreement or would establish the elements of a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. See Meridian Mortg., 
Inc. v. First Hawaiian Bank, 109 Hawai' i 35, 44, 122 P.3d 1133, 
1142 (App. 2005) (describing the required elements for a claim of tortious interference with contractual relations). 
We affirm the Circuit Court's (1) "Partial Final
 
Judgment in Favor of Plaintiffs" filed on September, 16, 2011,
 and (2) Judgment Dismissing Cross-Claim filed on October 13,
 2011.
