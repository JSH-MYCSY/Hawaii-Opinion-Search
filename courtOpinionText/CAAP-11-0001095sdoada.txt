IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
ANGSTER EDWARD, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1SD11-1-4)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In a post-conviction special prisoner proceeding,
 
Petitioner-Appellant Angster Edward (Edward) appeals from the
 
November 29, 2011 "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of
 
Order Denying Rule 40 Petition" entered in District Court of the
 
1
First Circuit  (district court), denying reconsideration of his
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 petition (Rule 40 
Petition) for post-conviction relief from a judgment of conviction for sexual assault in the fourth decree. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Edward's
 
appeal is without merit.

 The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided.
      If you are not a citizen of the United States, you are
hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you
have been charged may have the consequences of deportation,
exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of
naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.
 
     Upon request, the court shall allow the defendant
additional time to consider the appropriateness of the plea
in light of the advisement as described in this section.

Edward based his motion for reconsideration on his
 
argument the court taking his plea did not adequately inform him
of the possible immigration consequences of his plea.
  
When the district court entertained Edward's no contest
 
plea on December 8, 2010, the following colloquy occurred:
 
THE COURT: Now, if you're not a U.S. citizen, some
pleas might affect your stay in the country. You might be
deported, detained, denied naturalization, denied entry into
the country.
 
So, Mr. Edward, have you understood everything so far?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 802E-2 (1993) 
provides:
 
§ 802E-2 Court advisement concerning alien status
required.  Prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere to any offense punishable as a crime under state
law, except offenses designated as infractions under state
law, the court shall administer the following advisement on
the record to the defendant:
 
Edward contends the district court did not comply with
 
HRS § 802E-2 because the court advised Edward that "some pleas"
 
might affect his stay in the country as opposed to the language
 
in HRS § 802E-2, stating "the conviction of the offense for which
 
you have been charged may have . . . consequences[.]"
 
The majority of states with statutes similar to HRS chapter 802E
require substantial, not literal, compliance with the statutory
advisement requirement. See, e.g., State v. Malcolm, 257 Conn.
653, 778 A.2d 134, 139 (2001); Slytman v. United States, 804 A.2d
1113, 1116 (D.C. 2002); State v. Francis, 104 Ohio St.3d 490, 820
N.E.2d 355, 363 (2004); Machado v. State, 839 A.2d 509, 513 (R.I.
2003). These courts hold that although verbatim recitation of the
statutory advisement is preferable, the denial of a defendant's
guilty or nolo contendere plea will be upheld on appeal as long as
the defendant is substantially informed of the three specific
immigration consequences of (1) deportation, (2) exclusion, and
(3) denial of naturalization.

State v. Sorino, 108 Hawai' i 115, 124, 117 P.3d 847, 856 (Haw. 
App. 2005) (Watanabe, Acting C.J., concurring and dissenting). 
We conclude Chapter 802E (1993) requires substantial, 
not literal, compliance with the requirement of advising the 
defendant in accordance with HRS § 802E-2. When interpreting 
statutes, this court's "foremost obligation is to ascertain and 
give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute 
itself. And we must read statutory language in the context of 
the entire statute and construe it in a manner consistent with 
its purpose." Silva v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 115 Hawai' i 1, 
6, 165 P.3d 247, 252 (2007) (citation omitted). The purpose of chapter 802E is reflected in HRS § 802E-1 (1993), which 
states that, in cases in which a conviction 
is grounds for deportation, exclusion from admission to the
United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the
laws of the United States. . . . [I]t is the intent of the
legislature in enacting this section to promote fairness to
such accused individuals by requiring in such cases that
acceptance of a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere be
preceded by an appropriate warning of the special
consequences for such a defendant which may result from the
plea.
 
The purpose of the statute is to ensure that the defendant is
 
advised of those consequences prior to entering a plea, and as
 
long as those consequences are sufficiently addressed, the
 
purpose of the statute is accomplished. Put another way, there
 
is nothing in section 802E-1 that suggests that any deviation
 
from the text of 802E-2 requires that the judgment be vacated.
 
The district court's advisement to Edward substantially
 
complied with HRS § 802E-2 because the court explicitly warned
 
Edward of the possible immigration and naturalization
 
consequences of his plea. The district court expressly warned
 
Edward he "might be deported, detained, denied naturalization,
 
denied entry into the country." It was clear this advisement was
 
given to Edward because of the plea he was entering.
