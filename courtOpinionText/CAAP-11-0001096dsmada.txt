APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0791(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Karen Ryan's (Appellant
 
Ryan) appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-11-0001096 from the Honorable
 Rhonda I.L. Loo's November 28, 2011 judgment and December 22,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2011 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider Order 
denying Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal, Filed 11/14/11" (the December 22, 2011 interlocutory order), because the November 28, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994), and, absent an appealable final judgment, the December 22, 2011 interlocutory order is not eligible for appellate review. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal 
may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified
[.] 
Id. (emphases added). When interpreting the requirements for a 
judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted 
that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 
parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. 
Although the parties asserted multiple claims through a
 
complaint and multiple cross-claims, the November 28, 2011
 judgment enters judgment only on the claims in Appellant Ryan's
 complaint. The November 28, 2011 judgment does not contain
 operative language that enters judgment on or dismisses the
 multiple cross-claims. Instead, the November 28, 2011 judgment
 merely summarizes that, at earlier times in this case, the
 circuit court entered
 
•	 a prior September 8, 2011 order dismissing Defendant/Cross-
Claim Plaintiff/ Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Alpha
Executive Security, Inc.'s, cross-claim, and
 
•	 a prior October 6, 2011 order dismissing Defendant/Cross-
Claim Plaintiff/ Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Lowson
Associates Lowson's cross-claim.
 
Language such as this within a judgment that describes past 
rulings does not have the operative effect of resolving, on its face, all of the parties' claims, as a judgment must do under the holding in Jenkins. Nor does the November 28, 2011 contain an express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on one or more but less than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Although the November 28, 2011 judgment concludes with a statement that "[t]here are no remaining claims or parties[,]" the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has specifically 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
explained that 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1339 n.4 (emphases 
added). The November 28, 2011 judgment does not, on its face, 
resolve all of the parties' claims, and, thus, the November 28, 2011 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, the December 22, 2011 interlocutory order is an interlocutory order that is not eligible for appellate review. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-11-0001096. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in
 
Appeal No. CAAP-11-0001096 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
