APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-150K)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Counterclaim Defendants/Appellants Dennis K.
 
Kanahele, et al. (Plaintiffs) appeal from the November 30, 2011
 
Judgment entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit1
 
(circuit court). Judgment granted summary judgment in favor of
 Defendants/Appellees Bill and Suzanne Brodbeck (Brodbecks) and
 
Defendant-Intervenor Counterclaimant/Appellee Myra Mitchell Trust
 
(collectively, Defendants) as to Plaintiffs' complaint to quiet
 
title and as to Myra Mitchell Trust's counterclaim to quiet title
 
to an easement.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal arises out of Plaintiffs' November 16, 2004 
complaint to quiet title to a six-acre parcel of land in Hawai' i 
County (Parcel 4). In their complaint, Plaintiffs asserted they were the descendants of Kamaka Pakiko, who had received sole 
title and interest to Parcel 4 through a deed dated December 23, 
1905 and recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on October 7, 
1935. Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment 
against several defendants (not including the Brodbecks and the 
Myra Mitchell Trust), seeking an order that those defendants have 
no interest in Parcel 4. The circuit court granted Plaintiffs' 
motion on September 29, 2009, quieting title in favor of 
Plaintiffs. 
The remaining issue before us concerns an easement
 
agreement between the Brodbecks and one of the Plaintiffs, Leland
 
Pali, Jr. (Pali). Pali owns a one-fifth interest in Parcel 4 and
 
was the only Plaintiff in possession of Parcel 4 when Plaintiffs
 
filed their complaint. In the complaint, Plaintiffs stated the
 
1

2
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreement is valid as to Pali's one-fifth interest because Pali
 
entered into the agreement. However, Plaintiffs alleged the
 
easement agreement is invalid as to the Plaintiffs who did not
 
agree to it and claimed the easement is adverse to their
 
interests. Plaintiffs requested the following relief regarding
 
the easement:
 
E. That this court determine that title to [Parcel
4] is held by the Plaintiffs, free and clear of all claims,
liens, encumbrances, and clouds of any kind on said title,
pursuant to Hawaii Revised [Statutes (HRS)], Chapter 669
[(1993)], save and except for the easement conveyed by
Plaintiff LELAND PALI, JR. to Defendants BILL M. BRODBECK
and SUZANNE BRODBECK that only affects Plaintiff LELAND
PALI, JR.'s one-fifth interest in [Parcel 4]. 
. . . .
 
G. That the court eject all parties that it finds
not to have a valid title or claim to [Parcel 4] from
[Parcel 4], including but not limited to entering an order
of ejectment as to Defendants BILL M. BRODBECK and SUZANNE
BRODBECK and ordering them to remove any and all
improvements that they have constructed on [Parcel 4].
 
The Brodbecks own Parcel 5, which adjoins Parcel 4.
 
Parcels 4, 5, and 6 (which is owned by the Myra Mitchell Trust
 
and adjoins Parcel 5) all adjoin the Mamalahoa Highway. In 1994,
 
the Brodbecks entered into an agreement with Pali which purported
 
to grant the Brodbecks a fifty-foot easement for a roadway from
 
the Mamalahoa Highway and over Parcels 4 and 5. The agreement
 
provided that the easement would be for the use of the owners of
 
Parcels 4 and 5. The agreement stated Pali "claims to be and has
 
good reasons to believe that he is the owner of [Parcel 4]" but
 
further noted:
 
1. Easement in Favor of Parcel 5. . . . PALI does
 
not warrant or guaranty that he is the exclusive owner of
the subject property or other person with authority to bind
all owners and makes this grant, conveyance or transfer on a
quitclaim basis only, which BRODBECK understands and
accepts.
 
*  *  *
 
8. Acknowledgment of Other Possible Claimants.
BRODBECK acknowledges that there are or may be persons other
than PALI who claim or may have an interest in Parcel 4.
PALI's agreements herein may not bind such others, and
BRODBECK acknowledges and agrees that he shall take no
action against and releases all claims against PALI and his
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
successors based upon or arising from any claims or
interests of such others.
 
In accordance with the agreement, the Brodbecks
 
constructed a roadway. The easement agreement gave the Brodbecks
 
the power to grant use of the easement area to others, and the
 
Brodbecks gave the Myra Mitchell Trust the right to use the
 
roadway.
 
After the circuit court entered partial summary
 
judgment quieting title to Parcel 4 in Plaintiffs' favor,
 
Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming an
 
easement by necessity and an express easement pursuant to the
 
easement agreement. Plaintiffs' opposition to the motion
 
included a declaration from Plaintiff Dennis Kanahele stating
 
that a locked gate had been placed over the easement area,
 
blocking Plaintiffs' access to the roadway and to the remainder
 
of Parcel 4 beyond the gate. Kanahele stated he had requested
 
but never received the access code for the gate.
 
The circuit court held a hearing on Defendants' motion
 
for summary judgment on July 27, 2010. On October 29, 2010, the
 
circuit court entered its order granting Defendants' motion for
 
summary judgment, concluding "a necessity for an easement exists
 
for access to and from the [Defendants'] parcels and Mamalahoa
 
Highway, the location of the easement is reasonable, and the
 
agreement signed by Plaintiff Leland Pali, Jr. is valid and
 
binding against the co-tenants of the subject property."
 
On August 31, 2011, Defendants filed a "Motion to 
Certify Order Granting Summary Judgment as a Final Judgment Under 
Rule 54(b), [Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)]." The 
circuit court granted the Defendants' motion to certify and entered the HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified Judgment on November 30, 
2011. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on December 29, 2011. 
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend the circuit court erred
 
in granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment because (1)
 
an issue of material fact exists as to whether the requisites for
 
an easement by necessity were shown, and (2) the easement
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5agreement signed by Pali was not valid and binding upon the
remaining Plaintiffs.
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo.  See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawai# i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai# i
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001).
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  A fact is material if
proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party.  In other
words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.
Kahale v. City and County of Honolulu, 104 Hawai# i 341, 344,
90 P.3d 233, 236 (2004) (citation omitted).
Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai# i 90,
96, 194 P.3d 531, 537 (2008).
III.  DISCUSSION
A. Jurisdiction
Defendants contend this court lacks jurisdiction
because Plaintiffs' notice of appeal was untimely.  The Judgment
states "this judgment will take effect as of November 21, 2011,"
but the circuit court did not enter the Judgment until November
30, 2011.  Defendants argue Plaintiffs should have filed their
notice of appeal within thirty days of the Judgment's effective
date of November 21, 2011.
We disagree.  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
4(a)(1) states "the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30
days after entry of the judgment or appealable order."  (Emphasis
added.).  Thus, although the Judgment states its effective date
is November 21, 2011, the Judgment did not trigger the thirty-day
time period for filing a notice of appeal until its entry on
November 30, 2011.  Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal onNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
December 29, 2011, within thirty days after the November 30, 2011
 
entry of the Judgment. Therefore, Plaintiffs' appeal is timely,
 
and this court has jurisdiction.
 
B. Easement By Necessity
 
In their motion for summary judgment, Defendants 
claimed a right-of-way easement by necessity arose from the government's realignment of the Mamalahoa Highway. In the 1930s, 
the Territory of Hawai' i obtained permission from the previous 
owners of Parcels 4, 5, and 6 to realign the adjoining Mamalahoa Highway. Defendants claim the realignment eliminated their 
parcels' access to the realigned highway but left Parcel 4's 
access intact. Defendants contend the facts and circumstances 
establish their need for an easement, as well as the intent of 
the owner of Parcel 4 to grant a right-of-way to the "landlocked" 
parcels following the realignment project's completion. 
2
At common law,  an easement can be implied on the basis
of necessity. See, e.g., Kalaukoa v. Keawe, 9 Haw. 191, 2 (1893)
 
("A way of necessity is merely a way created by an implied grant
 or reservation[.]"). It is well established, however, that
 
"[a]ll implications of easements necessarily involve an original
 
unity of ownership of the parcels which later become the dominant
 
and servient parcels." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua
 
v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai' i 97, 105, 58 P.3d 608, 616 
(2002) (quoting Neary v. Martin, 57 Haw.577, 561 P.2d 1281 
(1977)); see also 28A C.J.S. Easements § 112 ("Ways of necessity 
cannot exist where there was never any unity of ownership of the 
alleged dominant and servient estates."). In Kalaukoa v. Keawe, 
the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hawai' i concluded the 
defendant established entitlement to an implied easement by necessity by showing, inter alia, that plaintiff's and the 
defendant's lands formerly belonged to the same person. 
Kalaukoa, 9 Haw. at 1. 
2
 Hawai'i also recognizes easements by necessity under HRS § 7-1 (2009
Repl.). However, Defendants did not raise or argue entitlement to an easement by
necessity under HRS § 7-1. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7In this case, Defendants concede there was no common
ownership of Parcels 4, 5, and 6.  Defendants failed to establish
an implied easement by necessity, and the circuit court
erroneously concluded "a necessity for an easement exists for
access to and from the [Defendants'] parcels and Mamalahoa
Highway[.]" 
C. Easement Agreement Signed By Pali
The agreement between Pali and the Brodbecks, which
purported to grant an express easement for a roadway over Parcel
4, was signed by Pali but notes the possibility that other
persons besides Pali may have an interest in Parcel 4.  Although
Plaintiffs concede the agreement may be valid as to Pali's one-
fifth interest, Plaintiffs claim the circuit court erred in
denying their ejectment action and in concluding the agreement is
"valid and binding against the co-tenants of the subject
property."
Our courts have held that one co-tenant may "convey a
specific part of the common property by a deed perfectly valid
between the grantor and grantee and voidable by the nonassenting
tenants in common to the extent only that the conveyance may
impair or vary their rights."  Foster v. Waiahole Water Co.,  25
Haw. 726, 736 (1921);  see also Marks v. Ah Nee, 48 Haw. 92, 98,
395 P.2d 620, 623 (1964).  In Foster, 25 Haw. at 736, the Hawai# i
Supreme Court held that this rule applies equally to the grant of
an easement by one co-tenant.  The supreme court stated: "[I]t is
immaterial whether the deed conveys the fee or an easement only. 
In either case there must be no material injury to the rights and
interests of the other cotenants."
We vacate and remand for further proceedings because
the record indicates Defendants interfered with Plaintiffs' use
of and access to a portion of Parcel 4 by placing a locked gate
over the roadway area.  The easement agreement states: "Parcel 4
and/or any portion thereof may utilize the easement," and at the
summary judgment hearing, Defendants' attorney stated Defendants
were willing to give Plaintiffs the gate's access code and toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
record a document confirming Plaintiffs' access. However, one of
 
the Plaintiffs submitted a declaration stating he has asked for
 
and has not received the access code, which is sufficient to
 
raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the easement
 
conveyance impaired or varied the rights of the nonassenting
 
Plaintiffs.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The November 30, 2011 Judgment entered in the Circuit
 
Court of the Third Circuit is vacated, and this case is remanded
 
for further proceedings.
