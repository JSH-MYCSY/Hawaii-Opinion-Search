(10)

(11) a November 30, 2011 "Order Denying Request for

Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
 
(Supp. 2011) and HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), an aggrieved
 
party may appeal a final decision and order by the LIRAB directly
 to the intermediate court of appeals:
 
1
 At relevant times, the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
Board (the LIRAB) was composed of Chairperson Roland Q.F. Thom, Member Melanie
S. Matsui, and Member David A. Pendleton.

The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). Appellant Gomes is appealing from twelve interlocutory orders that did not end the proceedings before the LIRAB and leave nothing further to be accomplished. According to the record on appeal, the LIRAB has yet to enter a final order that finally adjudicates the substantive issues in Appellant Gomes's appeal before the LIRAB, which is currently scheduled for a future trial on September 18, 2012. Therefore, the twelve interlocutory orders are not appealable final orders under HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a). Although exceptions to the final order requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the twelve interlocutory orders do not satisfy all the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order

doctrine). Absent an appealable final decision and order by the
 
LIRAB, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP­
11-0001102 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
