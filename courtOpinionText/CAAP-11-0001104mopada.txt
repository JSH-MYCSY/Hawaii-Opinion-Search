I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 24, 2011, U.S. Bank filed a complaint for 
ejectment in the district court against Defendants. U.S. Bank 
alleged it was the fee simple owner of the subject property 
(Property) by virtue of a non-judicial foreclosure sale held on 
March 29, 2011, and the subsequent recording on July 29, 2011 of 
a Quitclaim Deed identifying U.S. Bank as the grantee and 
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawaif i 
1
 In the record on appeal, Herminia Castro's name is spelled
alternatively as "Herminia" and "Hermina." We use the spelling set forth in
Defendants' briefs and motions.

(BOC). The complaint alleged Defendants were wrongfully
 
occupying the Property despite written notice to vacate, and U.S.
 
Bank requested a judgment for possession, writ of possession, and
 
money damages. U.S. Bank filed a motion for summary judgment and
 
writ of possession on October 27, 2011. U.S. Bank's supporting
 
documentation included a "Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure
 
Under Power of Sale" and the resulting quitclaim deed issued in
 
its favor, both recorded in the BOC. On November 7, 2011,
 
Defendants' counsel opposed the motion and filed additional
 
motions, including a motion to dismiss U.S. Bank's complaint for
 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
 
On December 13, 2011, the district court entered its
 
order 1) granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment and
 
writ of possession; 2) granting Defendants' motion to set aside
 
entry of default; 3) denying Herminia Castro's motion for leave
 
to file an answer and counterclaim against U.S. Bank; and 4)
 
denying Herminia Castro's motion to dismiss U.S. Bank's complaint
 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court
 
entered a judgment for possession and a writ of possession in
 
U.S. Bank's favor the same day.
 
Defendants filed a timely notice of appeal on December 
30, 2011. On appeal, Defendants contend the district court erred 
in (1) denying Herminia Castro's motion to dismiss, (2) denying 
her request for a continuance of the summary judgment hearing 
pursuant to Hawaif i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f), 
and (3) granting summary judgment in U.S. Bank's favor. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing a
case where the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not
on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit court
without subject matter jurisdiction is void.

CIO, 107 Hawaif i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting

Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawaif i 152, 158-59, 977 P.2d 160, 166-67 
(1999)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Defendants contend the district court erred in denying
 
Herminia Castro's motion to dismiss U.S. Bank's complaint for
 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 604-5(d) (Supp. 2012) precludes the district courts from
 
exercising jurisdiction in "real actions . . . in which the title
 
to real estate comes in question[.]" Pursuant to District Court
 
3
Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1 , defendants may
assert, as a defense to the district court's jurisdiction, that
 
the action is one in which title to real estate will come in
 
question. 
DCRCP Rule 12.1 requires defendants provide an 
affidavit setting forth the "source, nature, and extent of the 
title claimed by defendant" and "such further particulars as 
shall fully apprise the court of the nature of the defendant's 
claim." 
"[T]he source, nature, and extent of title claimed by 
the defendant, must be described to the court with some detail and specificity." Deutsche Bank Nat'l. Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 
Hawaifi 32, 37, 265 P.3d 1128, 1133 (2011). 
In Monette v. Benjamin, 52 Haw. 246, 473 P.2d 864, 
(1970), the Hawaif i Supreme Court examined an affidavit in which 
the declarant claimed title to the property on behalf of herself 
3
 DCRCP Rule 12.1 states:
 
Rule 12.1. DEFENSE OF TITLE IN DISTRICT COURTS
 
Pleadings.  Whenever, in the district court, in
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.

and her five brothers, who had inherited the property from their
 
deceased father. Id. at 248, 473 P.2d at 865. The supreme court
 
concluded the affidavit, though "very clumsily worded," set forth
 all of the information called for in the rule and put in issue
 
the title to the land involved. Id. (internal quotations
 
omitted). The court stated:
 
A fair reading of the affidavit show[ed] that [the
defendant] claimed title to the land in question by
inheritance from her father, who in turn had inherited from
his father, and that the title claimed by her was an
undivided one-sixth interest in fee simple, which descended
to her by intestate succession from the immediately
preceding sole owner. 
 
Id. Cf. Peelua, 126 Hawaif i at 38-39, 265 P.3d at 1134-35 
(concluding the defendant's affidavit, which stated that the 
defendant's family had owned the property since the Great Mahele4 
and deeded the property to the defendant, "failed to provide any detail or specificity regarding the source, nature, or extent of 
title claimed"); Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawaif i 95, 
100, 110 P.3d 1042, 1047 (2005) (affidavit's mere assertion that "title is at issue" was insufficient to validate jurisdiction 
defense). 
5
The declaration  Herminia Castro submitted in
opposition to U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment satisfies
 
the DCRCP Rule 12.1 requirements for raising an issue of title. 
The declaration states the following regarding the "source,
 
nature, and extent" of Defendants' claim to title:
 
3. 	[Herminia Castro] and her husband purchased the
[Property] from the prior owners in 2002.
 
4. 	She and her husband owned the property in fee simple as
tenants by the entirety. 
5. 	Her husband died in 2005.
 
6. 	She owned the property after her husband died.
 
4
 See Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawaif i 239, 172 P.3d 983
(2007).

 Herminia Castro submitted an unsworn declaration subscribed to be 
true under penalty of law, and Rule 7(g) of the Rules of the District Courtsof the State of Hawaif i authorizes submission of a declaration in lieu of an 
affidavit.

. . . .
 
13. 	She and her son made a [mortgage refinance] loan with New
Century [Mortgage Corporation].
 
. . . .
 22. 	She and her son hold title as joint tenants having acquired
the property from Herminia Castro, who acquired title from
Herminia Castro and her husband, now deceased, and title was
recorded in the names of Herminia Castro as Joint Tenants. 
Similar to the affidavit in Monette, Defendants' declaration
 
apprised the court that Herminia Castro acquired title by
 
succession after her husband's death, that she refinanced the
 
mortgage on the Property with her son, and that she claims an
 
undivided interest in fee simple with her son. Therefore, the
 
declaration contained sufficient information regarding the
 
source, nature, and extent of title claimed by Defendants. 
Defendants' declaration and motion to dismiss also 
contended the underlying transactions involving the Property were 
void and did not result in proper title to U.S. Bank. Defendants 
alleged the loan was void because it was based on fraud in the 
inducement or unfair and deceptive acts and practices. 
Defendants also alleged U.S. Bank lacked standing to foreclose 
because of a break in the chain of title of the loan documents. 
The assertions sufficed to apprise the court of Defendants' claim 
that the non-judicial foreclosure was void and that Defendants 
retained title. Cf. Peelua, 126 Hawaif i at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134 
(defendant's reference to having been "defrauded, duped, coerced, and tricked" into engaging in transactions involving the property 
did not provide sufficient detail for the court to ascertain how 
or whether the allegation had any bearing to title). 
We conclude Defendants' declaration contained
 
sufficient detail and specificity to fully apprise the court of
 
the source, nature, and extent of Defendants' claim of title to
 
the Property. Accordingly, the district court lacked
 
jurisdiction in this matter. In light of our conclusion, we do
 
not address Defendants' remaining points of error.
