SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2This is a consolidated secondary appeal arising from a
labor dispute between Complainant-Appellant/Appellant Hawai #i
State Teachers Association (HSTA), Respondents-
Appellees/Appellees Neil Abercrombie, Governor, State of Hawai# i;
Kalbert Young, Director, Department of Budget and Finance, State
of Hawai #i; Neil Dietz, Chief Negotiator, Office of Collective
Bargaining, State of Hawai #i; Kathryn Matayoshi, Superintendent,
Department of Education, State of Hawai# i; Donald G. Horner,
Chairperson, Board of Education, State of Hawai #i; and James D.
Williams, Member, Board of Education, State of Hawai# i
(collectively, Abercrombie), and Agency-Appellees/Appellees
Hawai#i Labor Relations Board, James B. Nicholson, Sesnita A.D.
Moepono, and Rock B. Ley (collectively, HLRB).  HSTA appeals from
the following: 
(1)  "Order Granting Agency-Appellees Hawaii Labor
Relations Board, et al.'s Ex-Parte Motion For Leave To Extend
Time Within Which To File Certified Record On Appeal," filed
October 19, 2011 (Motion for Extension); 
(2)  "Order Granting Respondents-Appellees' Motion To
Dismiss For Lack Of Jurisdiction filed October 17, 2011," filed
December 9, 2011; 
(3)  "Order Denying HSTA's Motion To Continue Hearings
On Respondents-Appellees' Motion To Dismiss For Lack Of
Jurisdiction And Agency-Appellee Hawaii Labor Relations Board's
Substantive Joinder Thereto filed November 1, 2011," filed
December 7, 2011;
(4)  "Order Denying HSTA's Motion For Reconsideration,
Filed on October 28, 2011," filed December 13, 2011; 
(5)  Judgment, filed December 9, 2011;
(6)  "Notice of Entry of Judgment," filed December 9,
2011; and
(7)  "Order Denying Agency Appellee Hawaii Labor
Relations Board, et al.'s Motion To Amend The Complainant-  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant's Designation Of Record On Appeal, Dated September 30,
 
2011 And Order Of Certification And Transmittal Of Records, Dated
 
September 30, 2011 And For Extension Of Time To File Certified
 
Record On Appeal, Filed October 14, 2011," filed January 20,
 
2012.1 All orders and judgments were entered in the Circuit
 
2
Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court) in favor of
Abercrombie and HLRB and against HSTA in the review of an
 
interlocutory order issued by HLRB.
 
HSTA contends the circuit court erred when it:
 (1) found the "Order Denying Complainant's Motion to
 
Shorten Time to Hear Motion for Interlocutory Relief and To
 Expedite Issues Before the Board filed July 26, 2011" (Order No.
 
2814) by HLRB was not an appealable preliminary order thereby
 
granting Abercrombie's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
 
Jurisdiction;
 
(2) denied HSTA's motion for continuance and hearing
 
the motion to dismiss without reviewing the designated record on
 
appeal; and
 
(3) granted HLRB's Motion for Extension and decided the
 
substantive motion to dismiss without reviewing the complete
 
record on appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude HSTA's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
(1) HSTA contends the circuit court erred by
 
dismissing the appeal before reviewing the designated record and
 
holding Order No. 2814 was not an appealable interlocutory order. 
1
 HSTA filed a separate Notice of Appeal regarding this matter in
CAAP-12-0000047. Subsequently, CAAP-12-0000047 and CAAP-11-0001107 were
consolidated under CAAP-11-0001107 by order of this court dated February 9,
2012.

"The right to appeal is purely statutory and exists 
only when jurisdiction is given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." Lingle v. Hawaii Gov't Emp. Ass'n, AFSCME, 
Local 512, AFL-CIO, 107 Hawai' i 178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 
(2005). "Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a 
contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature that 
deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final decision 
would deprive appellant of adequate relief is entitled to 
judicial review thereof under this chapter[.]" Hawaii Revised 
Statutes ยง 91-14(a) (2012 Repl.). 
HSTA asserts Order No. 2814 was "immediately appealable
 
because appellant and the employees represented by HSTA were
 
faced with the prospect of irreparable injury to the integrity of
 
the collective bargaining process with no practical means of
 
procuring effective relief after the close of agency
 
proceedings." HSTA characterizes Order No. 2814 as an indefinite
 
stay precluding injunctive relief. The circuit court, on the
 
other hand, described Order No. 2814 as "a scheduling order
 
[that] decides no issue of law or fact."
 
Order No. 2814 arose from HSTA's July 26, 2011 "Motion 
To Shorten Time To Hear Motion For Interlocutory Relief and To 
Expedite Resolution Of Issues Before The Board" requesting an 
expedited hearing for injunctive relief. In order to qualify for 
judicial review, the preliminary order must result in 
"irreparable injury" should the appellant be required to await 
final adjudication on the matter. See Mitchell v. State of 
Hawai'i Dep't of Educ., 77 Hawai' i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 
(1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). HSTA failed to show 
how failing to expedite a hearing that already took place caused 
irreparable harm. 
The circuit court correctly concluded that Order No.
 
2814 decided a procedural issue of scheduling that did not
 
deprive HSTA of injunctive relief. Even assuming that failing to 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
expedite the hearing resulted in delay, this does not 
automatically render a preliminary order appealable. "[T]he mere 
fact that there is delay or extra expenses involved would not 
amount to prejudice and allow a preliminary order to be subject 
to judicial review." Mitchell, 77 Hawai' i at 308, 884 P.2d at 
371 (quoting Inouye v. Bd. of Trustees of the Emp. Ret. Sys., 4 Haw. App. 526, 532 n.6, 669 P.2d 638, 642 n.6 (1983)). 
(2) HSTA contends the circuit court erred by
 
dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction before reviewing
 
the record on appeal.
 
The circuit court was not required to review the record 
on appeal to ascertain jurisdiction. "Our review of a motion to 
dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is based on the 
contents of the complaint, the allegations of which we accept as 
true and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff." 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 94 Hawai' i 330, 337, 13 P.3d 1235, 
1242 (2000) (quoting Love v. United States, 871 F.2d 1488 (9th Cir. 1989)) (formatting and brackets omitted). 
"When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 
12(b)(1) the trial court is not restricted to the face of the 
pleadings, but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and 
testimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence 
of jurisdiction." Casumpang, 94 Hawai' i at 337, 13 P.3d at 1242 
(citing McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.3d 558, 560 (5th Cir. 1988) (emphasis added and brackets omitted). "Neither the 
parties nor counsel have the right to cast upon this court the 
burden of searching a voluminous record" to determine 
jurisdiction when jurisdiction is not apparent on the face of the 
judgment or order giving rise to the appeal. Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1134, 
1338 (1994). HSTA could not require the circuit court to examine 
the record in order to find jurisdiction when it was not apparent 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from the Order No. 2814, pleadings, motions, or other documents
 
submitted to the circuit court. 
(3) HSTA contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in granting HLRB leave to extend time to file the
 
certified record on appeal and yet decided substantive motions
 
without that record. With the Notice of Appeal to the circuit
 
court, HSTA designated the "entire record of agency proceedings"
 
related to the contract dispute. HLRB claimed the designation
 
constituted an "overly broad and burdensome" request of documents
 
unrelated to Order No. 2814 and evidenced this assertion with the
 
HLRB log sheets documenting the numerous pleadings in this
 
dispute. HLRB asserted that the dispute over the designation of
 
the record would be moot if the circuit court dismissed the
 
appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The circuit
 
court granted HLRB's Motion for Extension, allowing until
 
December 12, 2011, "subject to further extension as warranted." 
HSTA maintains the circuit court violated HSTA's right to due
 
process by improperly granting leave to delay filing the record.
 
In an appeal to the circuit court, the official or body 
that rendered the order on appeal must certify and transmit the 
designated record "within 20 days of the date of the order or 
within such further time as may be allowed by the court." 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 72(d). HRCP Rule 
72(d) gives the circuit court discretion to grant leave for extended time to certify and transmit the designated record on 
appeal. HRCP Rule 72(d). The circuit court did not clearly 
exceed bounds of reason nor disregard rules of law by granting 
leave in light of HLRB's assertion that the voluminous record of 
a pending action required more time to certify and transmit. 
Furthermore, the circuit court acted within the bounds 
of reason to determine subject matter jurisdiction through review 
of the motions and opposition before mandating transmission of 
the record. See, Casumpang, 94 Hawai' i at 337, 13 P.3d at 1242. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Since the record on appeal was not necessary to the assessment of 
jurisdiction, the circuit court acted within its discretion to
 
allow HLRB more time to produce the record on appeal.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
 
(1) "Order Granting Agency-Appellees Hawaii Labor
 
Relations Board, et al.'s Ex-Parte Motion For Leave To Extend
 Time Within Which To File Certified Record On Appeal," filed
 
October 19, 2011;
