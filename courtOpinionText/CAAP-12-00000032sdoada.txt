(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Chadwick T. Rushforth (Rushforth)
 
appeals from the "Order and Notice of Entry of Order," filed

 
December 20, 2011, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
1
Honolulu Division (district court),  in which, after a bench
trial, the district court found Rushforth guilty of Operating a
 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp.
 2013).

 HRS § 291E-61 provides in pertinent part:
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Rushforth contends that (1) the charge was 
insufficient because Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) 
failed to allege the requisite mens rea, and (2) there was 
insufficient evidence to support the conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and briefs submitted
 
by the parties, and having given due consideration to the
 arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Rushforth's appeal as follows and remand the case to the
 district court with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
I. Sufficiency of the Charge
 
Rushforth did not challenge the sufficiency of the
 
charge in the district court and instead raises this issue for
 the first time on appeal. Addressing a similar situation, this
 court recently stated,
 
[w]here the appellant alleges a charge is defective for the
first time on appeal, an appellate court must "liberallyconstrue the indictment in favor of validity." State v. 
Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 93, 657 P.2d 1019, 1021 (1983); see alsoState v. Wells, 78 Hawai' i 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995). In such 
circumstances, a conviction will not be vacated 'unless the
defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime." Motta, 66 
Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020 (emphasis added). 
State v. Nabarro, No. CAAP-12-0000279, 2014 WL 1744076, at *1
 
(App. Apr. 29, 2014) (SDO) (original brackets omitted).
 
We further noted in Nabarro, however, that the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court has "ruled that, even under the liberal construction standard, because the charge failed to allege the required mens rea, the charge 'cannot be reasonably construed to state an offense.'" Id. (citation omitted) (quoting State v. 
Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 358, 311 P.3d 676, 681 (2013)). 
The charge in this case was deficient for failing to 
allege the requisite mens rea. Pursuant to State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), a charge under HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) must allege the requisite mens rea. Id. at 50, 276 P.3d 
at 619. Because HRS § 291E-61 itself does not specify a state of mind, HRS § 702-204 (1993) applies. 127 Hawai
'i at 53, 276 P.3d 
at 622. HRS § 702-204 provides, "[w]hen the state of mind 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
required to establish an element of an offense is not specified
 
by the law, that element is established if, with respect thereto,
 a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly." 
Accordingly, the charge should have alleged that Rushforth acted
 intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly as to the elements of the
 offense. 
II. Sufficiency of the Evidence
 
Although the charge was deficient, we must also address
 
Rushforth's assertion that there was insufficient evidence
 adduced at trial to support his conviction. See State v. Davis,
 
No. SCWC-12-0000074, 2014 WL 747422, at *20 (Haw. Feb. 26, 2014);
 On appeal, Rushforth argues that the State failed to adduce
 sufficient evidence that the H-1 freeway (H-1), where the offense
 allegedly occurred, was a "public way, street, road, or highway." 
"[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, 
road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense." State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009) (citing 
HRS § 702-205 (1993)). In this case, therefore, the State was required to prove, among other things, that Rushforth operated a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway. See HRS 
701-114(1)(a) (1993). 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we apply
 
the following standard:
 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before a judge or jury. The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.
 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) 
(citation omitted, brackets in original). 
During the bench trial, the evidence established that
 
Rushforth was in a collision while driving on the H-1 near the
 
Lunalilo exit. Rushforth contends, however, that the State
 failed to adduce sufficient evidence that the offense charged
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
took place upon a "public way, street, road, or highway." 
The definition of "public way, street, road, or
 
highway," as set forth in HRS § 291E-1 (2007 and Supp. 2013),
 
provides in part that:
 
"Public way, street, road, or highway" includes:
 
(1)	 The entire width, including berm or shoulder, of every
road, alley, street, way, right of way, lane, trail,
highway, or bridge; . . . 
(Emphasis added.)
 
In the Statewide Traffic Code, "highway" is defined as
 
"the entire width between the boundary lines of every way
 
publicly maintained . . . when any part thereof is open to the
 use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel." HRS § 291C­1 (2007). Based on the evidence adduced during the bench trial, 
H-1 was clearly open to the public for the purposes of vehicular
 travel. Moreover, we take judicial notice that H-1 is publicly
 maintained.
3 See HRS § 264-43 (Supp. 2013) ("The department of
 
transportation shall . . . maintain . . . all highways comprising
 the state highway system . . . ."); Hawaii Administrative Rules
 § 19-102-2 (providing that interstate highways are part of the
 state highway system); Stop H-3 Ass'n v. Dept. of Transp., 68
 Haw. 154, 156 n.1, 706 P.2d 446, 448 n.1 (1985) ("The [interstate
 highway] system is comprised of H-1, H-2, and H-3."). Therefore,
 H-1 comes within the definition of a "public way, street, road,
 or highway" because it meets the definition of a "highway." 
Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence adduced to
 
prove that Rushforth operated his vehicle on a "public way,
 street, road, or highway." The State is thus not precluded on
 double-jeopardy grounds from retrying Rushforth. See Davis, 2014
 
WL 747422, at *22-23. 
3
 The State requests that we take judicial notice, pursuant to Hawai' i 
Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201 (1993), that H-1 is a "public way, street,
road, or highway." Under HRE Rule 201(f), "[j]udicial notice may be taken atany stage of the proceeding."

Due to the deficient charge in this case, the "Order
 
and Notice of Entry of Order," filed December 20, 2011, in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is
 vacated. The case is remanded to the district court with
 instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
