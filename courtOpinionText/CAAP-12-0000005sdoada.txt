IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DAVID CARL GUSTAFSON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2P110-01759)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant David Carl Gustafson (Gustafson)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order entered
 
on December 6, 2011 (Judgment) by the District Court of the
 
1
Second Circuit (District Court).  Gustafson was charged with and
 
convicted of criminal trespass in the second degree in violation
 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) ยง 708-814(1)(a) (Trespass 2nd).
 
On appeal, Gustafson raises a single point of error,
 
contending that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of
 
Trespass 2nd because, even when the evidence is viewed in the
 
light most favorable to the State, there was insufficient
 
evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gustafson
 
knowingly, entered or remained without license, invitation, or
 
privilege in or upon the complaining witness's fenced property.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Gustafson's point of
 
error as follows:
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has 
long held that evidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when
the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such
evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies
whether the case was before a judge or a jury. The test on
 appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence
to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed,
even if it could be said in a bench trial that the
 conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as
there is substantial evidence to support the requisite
findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material
element of the offense charged is credible evidence
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge is
free to make all reasonable and rational inferences
 under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial
evidence.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931
(1992).
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). 
In addition, "[a]n appellate court will not pass upon 
the trial judge's decisions with respect to the credibility of 
witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because this is the 
province of the trial judge." Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai' i 42, 60, 
169 P.3d 994, 1012 (App. 2007) (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996)); see also State v. 
Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999). 
To sustain a conviction for Trespass 2nd in violation 
of HRS ยง 708-814(1)(a), the prosecution is required to prove that the defendant (1) knowingly; (2) entered or remained; (3) without 
license, invitation, or privilege; (4) in or upon premises that 
are enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders or are 
fenced. See, e.g., State v. Cavness, 80 Hawai' i 460, 463-64, 911 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 95, 98-99 (App. 1996); State v. Hanapi, 89 Hawai' i 177, 182, 
970 P.2d 485, 490 (1998). 
Here, the District Court specifically found that the
 
testimony of the complaining witness was more credible than that
 
of Gustafson, specifically including the testimony that Gustafson
 
was not invited or given permission to be on her property that
 
day when she observed him, from a few feet away, picking the lock
 
of and opening a sliding glass door to her home, which was
 
surrounded by a six-foot-tall fence and closed gate. The
 
complaining witness further testified that, after the door popped
 
open and Gustafson saw her, her turned and ran. Also, the
 
complaining witness testified that there was damage to the door
 
and the locking mechanism and that there were cracks in the
 
drywall around the door frame.
 
Based on this evidence, together with the entirety of
 
the other evidence presented, and reasonable inferences
 
therefrom, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to
 
support Gustafson's conviction and for the District Court to
 
reject Gustafson's defense that he believed that he was an
 
invited guest at the complaining witness's home because of prior
 
visits.
 
Accordingly, the District Court's December 6, 2011
 
Judgment is affirmed.
