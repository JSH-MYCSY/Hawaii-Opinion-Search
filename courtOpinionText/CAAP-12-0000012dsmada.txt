SUSAN S.Y. QUIMBY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
GATE GOURMET, INC. and STATE OF HAWAI» I, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2053)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant Susan S.Y.
 
Quimby (Appellant Quimby) has asserted from the Honorable Karl K.
 Sakamoto's December 13, 2011 "Order Summarily Denying Plaintiff
 Quimby's Motion for New Trial/Reconsideration of Order Dismissing
 
Complaint Filed Oct. 24, 2011" (the December 13, 2011
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interlocutory order).
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees.  Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai» i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate  document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis 
added). The Supreme Court of Hawai» i has held that "[a]n appeal 
may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a 
judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 Hawai» i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n order disposing of a circuit 
court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate 
judgment." Alford v. City and County of Honolulu, 109 Hawai» i 
14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; emphasis added). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai» i has held that, 
"[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of 
prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate 
document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires 
that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" 
Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corp. , 81 Hawai» i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 
1364, 1369 (1996) (emphasis added). In contrast, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai» i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). Because a judgment has 
already been entered by the time any post-judgment proceeding 
takes place, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto v. 
McCurdy, 103 Hawai» i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
At first glance, Appellant Quimby's appeal from the
 
December 13, 2011 interlocutory order might appear to be an
 appeal from a post-judgment order, because 
(a)	 HRCP Rule 60(b) expressly authorizes relief "from a
final judgment, order, or proceeding[,]"
 
(b)	 "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment relief
under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order
under HRS § 641-1(a)" (Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai »i 
at 160, 80 P.3d at 981 (citation omitted), and 
(c)	 the December 13, 2011 interlocutory order denied
Appellant Quimby's motion to set aside the circuit
court's September 14, 2011 dismissal order pursuant toRule 12(q) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the
State of Hawai
»i (RCCH). 
However, although the December 13, 2011 interlocutory order 
denied, in effect, Appellant Quimby's motion to set aside the September 14, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order, the September 14, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was not  an independently 
appealable order, because the circuit court did not reduce it to a separate judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 58. Price, 81 Hawai» i 
at 176, 914 P.2d at 1369 (a dismissal order is not eligible for appellate review absent the entry of a separate judgment). As an 
order that was not independently appealable, the September 14, 
2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was not a "judgment," as defined by HRCP Rule 54(a). See HRCP Rule 54(a) ("'Judgment' as 
used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an 
appeal lies."). Hawai» i appellate courts have held that "a 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion for reconsideration, pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), is 
authorized only in situations involving final judgments." Cho v. 
State, 115 Hawai» i 373, 382, 168 P.3d 17, 26 (2007) (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted); Crown Properties, Inc. v. Financial Security Life Insurance Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985) ("A Rule 60(b), HRCP, motion is authorized only in situations involving final judgments."); Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochrane, 8 Haw. App. 256, 262, 799 P.2d 60, 65 (1990) ("Rule 60(b) applies to motions seeking to amend final orders in the nature of judgments."). Similarly in 
federal courts, "[t]he standard test for whether a judgment is 'final' for Rule 60(b) purposes is usually stated to be whether 
the judgment is sufficiently 'final' to be appealed." 12 James 
Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice  § 60.23, at 81-82 (3d 
ed. 2009) (footnote omitted). Thus, the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has explained that "Rule 60(b) [of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] . . . applies only  to 
motions attacking final, appealable  orders[.]" United States v. 
Martin, 226 F.3d 1042, 1048 n.8 (9
th Cir. 2000) (emphases added). 
The September 14, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was an interlocutory order, and an interlocutory "order or other form of 
decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties." HRCP Rule 54(b). HRCP Rule 59 and HRCP Rule 60(b) are neither applicable to nor necessary for a motion for reconsideration prior to the entry of an appealable final judgment. Therefore, although Appellant Quimby purported 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to invoke HRCP Rule 60(b) in Appellant Quimby's motion to set 
aside the circuit court's September 14, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order, Appellant Quimby was actually attempting to invoke the circuit court's inherent authority (as reflected in HRCP Rule 54(b)) to revise any and all interlocutory orders prior to the entry of a judgment. Because the September 14, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order was not an appealable judgment (under the definition in HRCP Rule 54(a)), and because the circuit court did not enter any appealable separate judgment pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins, 76 Hawai» i 
at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338, HRCP Rule 60(b) did not apply to 
Appellant Quimby's motion to set aside the circuit court's 
September 14, 2011 RCCH Rule 12(q) dismissal order. 
Consequently, the December 13, 2011 interlocutory order is not a "post-judgment order" from which a party may appeal. Absent the 
entry of an appealable final judgment, the December 13, 2011 
interlocutory order is an interlocutory order that will be eligible for appellate review whenever a party asserts a timely 
appeal from the future entry of an appealable final judgment, because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review 
all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right 
which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski , 107 
Hawai» i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). Absent an appealable final judgment, Appellant Quimby's appeal from the December 13, 2011 interlocutory order is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000012 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
