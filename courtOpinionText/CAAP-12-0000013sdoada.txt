OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DIETRICH W. WASHINGTON, Defendant, and
EXODUS BAIL BOND, Real Party in Interest-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-1255)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Real-Party-in-Interest/Appellant Exodus Bail Bond
 
(Exodus) appeals from the December 12, 2011 Order Denying
 
Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture (Order re
 Forfeiture) entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (Circuit Court).

On appeal, Exodus fails to identify points of error, 
fails to provide any citations to the record, and otherwise fails 
to comply with the requirements of Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b). Exodus contends that the Order re 
Forfeiture is void and should be set aside because the Office of 
the Prosecuting Attorney (Prosecutor) is not permitted to 
represent the State of Hawai 'i in a bail forfeiture proceeding. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we address Exodus's
 
appeal as follows:
 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides that "[p]oints not
 
presented in accordance with [HRAP Rule 28(b)] will be
 
disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may
 
notice a plain error not presented." 
Moreover, in the proceedings before the Circuit Court, 
Exodus did not raise its claim that the Prosecutor may not 
represent the State's interests in a bond forfeiture proceeding. 
"As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at 
trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on 
appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil cases." 
State v. Moses, 102 Hawai 'i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). 
This court will consider new arguments when justice so requires. Id. However, under the circumstances of this case, and in light 
of the issue presented, Exodus's argument is deemed waived. 
Accordingly, the December 12, 2011 Order re Forfeiture
 
is affirmed.
