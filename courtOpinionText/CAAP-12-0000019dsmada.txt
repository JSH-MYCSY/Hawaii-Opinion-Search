APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 08-11707)
 
ORDER GRANTING DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES' MOTION
 
TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-12-0000019
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Petitioner-Appellee Department of
 
Human Services' (Appellee DHS) May 22, 2012 motion to dismiss
 
Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000019, (2) the lack of any memorandum in
 opposition to Appellee DHS's May 22, 2012 motion to dismiss
 appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000019, and (3) the record,
 it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Father­Appellant's appeal from the Honorable Bode A. Uale's November 28,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2011 "Order Denying Father's Motion to Waive filing Fees and 
Other Relief" (the November 28, 2011 interlocutory order) because the November 28, 2011 interlocutory order is not an appealable final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006). 
HRS § 571-54 governs the intermediate court of appeals'
 
jurisdiction over Father-Appellant's appeal. Under HRS § 571-54,
 "appeals in family court cases, as in other civil cases, may be
 taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or decree, . . . or
 (2) a certified interlocutory order." In re Doe, 96 Hawai' i 272, 
283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citations omitted). "Final order means an order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Familian Northwest v. Central Pacific Boiler, 
68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "However, it is widely acknowledged that a final judgment or decree is not necessarily the last decision of a case. What determines the finality of an order or decree is the nature and effect of the order or decree." In re Jane Doe, 77 Hawai' i 109, 114, 883 P.2d 30, 35 (1994) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "The very nature of a family court chapter 587 proceeding entails an ongoing case which does not result in a final order, as that term is generally defined, . . . because, under chapter 587, the family court retains continuing jurisdiction over the case in order to prevent future harm or threatened harm to a child." In 
re Doe, 96 Hawai' i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and original brackets omitted).

"[P]arents have fundamental liberty interests in the care, 
custody, and management of the[ir] child[ren]." In re Jane Doe, 
77 Hawai' i at 115, 883 P.2d at 36 (citations, internal quotation 
marks, and original brackets omitted). Thus, a family court order that "infringe[s] upon parental custody rights is an appealable decision even though the requisite finality normally required for appeals is lacking." Id. at 114, 883 P.2d at 35 
(citations omitted). 
No party asserted a timely appeal from the family
 
court's September 29, 2010 order terminating Father-Appellant's
 parental rights over his two children and awarding custody of the
 two children to Appellee DHS. Thus, the family court went
 forward with the proceeding for finalizing a permanent plan for
 the two children that has a projected adoption date of
 September 1, 2012. The family court has not yet entered an
 appealable final order in the proceeding for finalizing the
 permanent plan for the two children. The November 28, 2011
 interlocutory order is merely an interlocutory order within that
 unfinished proceeding, and the November 28, 2011 interlocutory
 order did not end that proceeding for finalizing a permanent plan
 for the two children, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. 
Therefore, the November 28, 2011 interlocutory order is not an
 appealable final order pursuant to HRS § 571-54. Absent a final
 order that is appealable pursuant to HRS § 571-54, this appeal is
 premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), the collateral
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
order doctrine, and certified interlocutory appeals under HRS 
§ 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2011), the November 28, 2011 interlocutory order does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under any of these exceptions. See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under Forgay); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 
631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641­1(b) (certified interlocutory appeals). 
Absent a timely appeal from an appealable final order,
 
we lack appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY
 ORDERED that Appellee DHS's May 22, 2012 motion to dismiss is
 granted, and Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000019 is dismissed for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction.
