I. BACKGROUND
 
On May 14, 2007, Defendants executed a note and a 
mortgage encumbering the subject property (Property) to First 
Magnus Financial Corporation (First Magnus). On January 6, 2011, 
an assignment of the mortgage was recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances of the State of Hawaif i (BOC), assigning the mortgage 
to FNMA. 
On May 9, 2011, FNMA filed a verified complaint for
 
ejectment in the district court against Defendants. FNMA alleged
 it was the fee simple owner of the Property by virtue of a non-
judicial foreclosure sale held on January 12, 2011, and the
 
subsequent recording on April 14, 2011 of a Quitclaim Deed
 
identifying FNMA as the grantee and recorded in the BOC. The
 
complaint alleged Defendants were wrongfully occupying the
 
Property despite written notice to vacate, and FNMA requested a
 
judgment for possession, writ of possession, and money damages.
 
FNMA filed a motion for summary judgment and writ of
 
possession on July 22, 2011. FNMA's supporting documentation
 
included a "Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of
 
Sale" (Mortgagee's Affidavit) and the resulting quitclaim deed
 
(Deed) issued in its favor, both recorded in the BOC. On
 
September 27, 2011, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
 
complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (Motion to
 
Dismiss).
 
On October 5, 2011, the district court held a hearing
 
on the motions, and it orally denied Defendants' Motion to
 
Dismiss and granted FNMA's motion for summary judgment. The
 
district court entered its order and a writ of possession and
 
judgment for possession on October 19, 2011. Defendants filed a
 
motion for reconsideration on October 26, 2011, which the
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
district court denied. Defendants filed a timely notice of
 
appeal on January 12, 2012.
 
On appeal, Defendants contend the district court erred
 
in denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and in granting summary
 
judgment.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing a
case where the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not
on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit court
without subject matter jurisdiction is void.
 
Lingle v. Hawaif i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL­
CIO, 107 Hawaif i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting 
Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawaif i 152, 158-59, 977 P.2d 160, 166-67 
(1999)). 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawaif i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawaif i 
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
 
Defendants contend the district court lacked subject
 
matter jurisdiction because the ejectment action raised an issue
 of title to the Property. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 604-5(d) (Supp. 2012) precludes district courts from exercising
 
jurisdiction in "real actions . . . in which the title to real
 
estate comes in question[.]" Pursuant to District Court Rules of
 
2
Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1,  defendants may assert, as a
defense to the district court's jurisdiction, that the action is
 
one in which title to real estate will come in question. 
DCRCP Rule 12.1 requires defendants to provide an 
affidavit setting forth the "source, nature, and extent of the 
title claimed by defendant" and "such further particulars as 
shall fully apprise the court of the nature of the defendant's 
claim." Bare assertions are insufficient to sustain a claim that 
title is at issue so as to divest the district court of 
jurisdiction. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 
Hawaifi 32, 37-38, 265 P.3d 1128, 1133-34 (2011). 
2
 DCRCP Rule 12.1 ("Defense of Title in District Courts") states:
 
Pleadings.  Whenever, in the district court, in
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Motion to Dismiss and the supporting declaration
 
failed to raise a question regarding title. Steven Medeiros's
 
declaration states in conclusory terms that "[First Magnus] was
 
undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization when they assigned my
 
mortgage. As further discussed in my attorney's memorandum,
 
attached hereto, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.'s
 
[(MERS)] act of assigning the Mortgage was an apparent violation
 
of Federal law[.]"
 
The sole question of title Defendants raised hinged on
 
the proposition that MERS lacked authority to assign any
 
interests of First Magnus if First Magnus was in bankruptcy. The
 
memorandum supporting the Motion to Dismiss cited no authority
 
for supporting its proposition, however. Defendants cited 11
 
U.S.C. § 362, which generally stays actions or proceedings
 
"against the debtor," "against property of the debtor," and
 
"against property of the estate." 11 U.S.C. § 362 does not
 
support Defendants' claims to title.
 
To the extent that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is
 
based on the assertion that the bankruptcy precluded assignment
 
of the mortgage, the declaration in support of the Motion to
 
Dismiss fails to provide any detail or specificity regarding the
 
particulars of such claim. The declaration simply asserts that
 
there was an "apparent violation of Federal law," but as in
 
Peelua, without further detail it cannot be ascertained how or
 
whether the allegation has any bearing on title to the property. 
126 Hawaii at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134.
 
Here, MERS's assignment of the mortgage was at First
 
Magnus's behest, and in executing the mortgage, Defendants
 
expressly permitted MERS to act on First Magnus's behalf. The
 
mortgage identifies MERS as "a separate corporation that is
 
acting solely as nominee for Lender . . . . MERS is the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mortgagee under this Security Instrument." The mortgage gives
 
MERS "the right to foreclose and sell the Property[,] and to take
 
any action required of Lender[.]" Under this plain language,
 
MERS had the authority to take any action required of First
 
Magnus, including assigning the mortgage to FNMA. 
Therefore, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss failed as a
 
matter of law, and the district court did not err in dismissing
 
the motion. 
B. Summary Judgment 
Defendants also contend there are genuine issues of
 
material fact regarding the propriety of the underlying non-
judicial foreclosure. We disagree. 
Defendants argue FNMA was required to produce "a
 
complete chain of title of the subject mortgage loan from the
 
initiation of the loan through the foreclosure." HRS § 667-5
 
(Supp. 2011) sets forth the specific actions a mortgagee must
 
take for a non-judicial foreclosure under a power of sale, and
 
nothing in the statute requires the mortgagee to produce a
 
complete chain of title. 
FNMA made a prima facie showing of the validity of the
 
foreclosure proceedings and of its entitlement to ejectment. In
 
support of its motion for summary judgment, FNMA attached as
 
exhibits the Mortgagee's Affidavit and the resulting Deed to the
 
Property issued in its favor, both recorded in the BOC. The
 
affidavit sets forth the mortgagee's acts related to the Property
 
fully and particularly and is evidence that the power of sale was
 
duly executed. See HRS § 667-8 (1993 Repl.). 
When the moving party satisfies its initial burden of 
production, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to 
establish that genuine issues of material fact exist. Stanford 
Carr Dev. Corp., v. Unity House, Inc., 111 Hawaif i 286, 296, 141 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d 459, 469 (2006). The party opposing summary judgment must 
show more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. 
Yoneda v. Tom, 110 Hawaif i 367, 384-85, 133 P.3d 796, 813-14 
(2006). Defendants' unsupported allegations that the Mortgagee's Affidavit and the Deed are fraudulent fail to raise a genuine 
factual issue.
