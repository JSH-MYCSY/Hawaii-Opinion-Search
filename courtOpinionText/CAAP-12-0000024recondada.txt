NO. CAAP-12-0000024
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
STEVEN MEDEIROS and LIZEL K. MEDEIROS, Defendants-Appellants
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-50 JANE DOES 1-50, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3RC11-1-467)
 
ORDER GRANTING JULY 19, 2012 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
OF JULY 18, 2012 DISMISSAL ORDER, AND ORDER TEMPORARILY
REMANDING THIS CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT,
WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO MAKE FORMAL FINDINGS
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the July 18, 2012 order dismissing
 
Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000024 for lack of jurisdiction, 
(2) Defendants-Appellants Steven Medeiros and Lizel K. Medeiros's
 (Appellants) July 19, 2012 motion for reconsideration of the July
 18, 2012 dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears 
that the issue of whether the Appellants' January 12, 2012 notice of appeal is untimely as to the Honorable Harry P. Freitas's October 19, 2011 judgment for possession under HRAP Rule 4(a) hinges on whether the Appellants actually submitted their motion for reconsideration (which was file-stamped on November 1, 2011) within ten days after entry of the October 19, 2011 judgment for possession. Rule 59 of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) requires a timely motion for reconsideration in order to invoke the tolling provision under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for filing a notice of appeal. The date on which a court clerk actually receives a document prevails over any subsequent file-stamped date on the document. See, e.g., Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai' i 
144, 151, 44 P.3d 1085, 1092 (2002). The record on appeal indicates that the motion for reconsideration was filed on November 1, 2011, which is more than ten days after entry of the October 19, 2011 judgment for possession. However, counsel for the Appellants asserts that the district court clerk stamped the reverse side of a page in the Appellants' November 1, 2011 motion for reconsideration that indicates that the district court clerk actually received the document on October 26, 2011. The electronic record on appeal for Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000024 does not contain the alleged clerk's stamp on the reverse side of a page of the November 1, 2011 file-stamped motion for reconsideration. Given the current record, we are unable to determine whether the district court clerk actually received the Appellants' motion for reconsideration on or before Monday,

October 31, 2011, the final day for a timely DCRCP Rule 59 motion
 
for reconsideration of the October 19, 2011 judgment for
 possession. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Appellants' July 19, 2012
 
HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the July 18, 2012
 dismissal order is granted, and this case is temporarily remanded
 to the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo

all for the purpose of determining the factual
issue of when the District Court actually received
the document entitled "Defendants Steven Medeiros
 and Lizel K. Medeiros' Motion for Reconsideration
 of the October 19, 2011 Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Summary Judgment and for Writ of
Possession[,]" which has a file-stamped date of

District Court clerk shall supplement the
electronic record on appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-12­0000024 with the District Court's written
 findings.
 
4.	 If the District Court's written findings indicate
that the Appellants' November 1, 2011 DCRCP Rule
59 motion for reconsideration was not timely under
DCRCP Rule 59 and HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), then
Plaintiff-Appellee Federal National Mortgage
Association shall promptly file a motion to
dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000024 for lack of
jurisdiction.
