THE MEMORANDUM OPINION

 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
On August 8, 2016, Defendants-Appellees/Cross-
Appellants DAVID W. LACY and LACY AND JACKSON, LLLC (the Lacy
Parties) filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Memorandum
 
Opinion, Filed July 29, 2016 (JEFS DOC 342), along with a
 
memorandum in support and a declaration of counsel (Motion for
 
Partial Reconsideration).1
 
In the Motion for Partial Reconsideration, the Lacy
 
Parties request reconsideration of this court's July 29, 2016
 
Memorandum Opinion to the extent that it vacated and remanded the
 award of attorneys' fees and costs in favor of the Lacy Parties
 and against Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee GORAN PLEHO, LLC,
 a Hawaii Limited Liability Company (GPLLC).
 
1
 On August 10, 2016, this court suspended the time requirement of
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 40(d) and extended the time for
disposition of the Motion for Partial Reconsideration to September 6, 2016. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for Partial
 
Reconsideration is denied as unnecessary, as it was not this
 
court's intent to disturb the award of attorneys' fees and costs
 in favor of the Lacy Parties and against GPLLC. 
Nevertheless, IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that this
 
court's July 29, 2016 Memorandum Opinion shall be clarified and
 amended, as follows: (1) on page 62 of the Memorandum Opinion,
 in the sentence immediately preceding Section G., after
 "attorneys' fees and costs award," to add "to the extent that it
 held Goran and Maria jointly and severally liable," and to
 thereafter add another sentence stating "The January 9, 2012
 order awarding attorneys' fees and costs is otherwise affirmed."; 
and (2) on page 65 of the Memorandum Opinion, in the sixth line,
 after "Parties," to add "to the extent that it held Goran and
 Maria jointly and severally liable to the Lacy Parties,".
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, August 26, 2016. 
On the motion:
 
Chief Judge

Keith K. Hiraoka,
