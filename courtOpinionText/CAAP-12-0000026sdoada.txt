IN THE INTEREST OF J CHILDREN:
 
KJ, KJ
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 09-12253)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Father-Appellant (Father) appeals from the Order
 
Terminating Parental Rights, filed December 28, 2011 in the
 
1
Family Court of the First Circuit  (family court).
On appeal, Father argues the family court lacked
 
personal jurisdiction over him because the "record is absent any
 
proof of service of the petitions and summons filed herein upon
 
appellant." 
Father claims that he was not personally served with
 
the Petition for Foster Custody, filed November 6, 2008 and an
 Amended Petition for Family Supervision, filed November 18, 2008,
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) ยง 587-33 (Repl.
 
2006).

 The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
conclude Father's appeal is without merit.
 
Father's claim that the family court lacked 
jurisdiction over him is without merit. A claim of lack of 
personal jurisdiction is waived when a party fails to assert the 
defense in a timely manner and in compliance with Hawai' i Family 
Court Rules 12(b), (g), (h)(1), and Rule 15(a). Puckett v. 
Puckett, 94 Hawai' i 471, 481, 16 P.3d 876, 886 (App. 2000) 
(husband's defense of lack of personal jurisdiction waived by failure to assert defense in first pleading, answer, first motion 
to dismiss, and personal appearance in court for hearing on pre-
decree relief). 
Father appeared at a hearing on July 13, 2009 to
 
determine the paternity of the children. Father appeared at
 
another hearing on August 20, 2009 in which he inquired about
 
placement of the children with relatives but had no objection to
 
continued foster custody. At a hearing on January 11, 2010,
 
Father's counsel stated that Father had no objection to DHS's
 
proposed order, which required DHS to assess whether visitation
 
with Father was appropriate, and also asked that foster custody
 
be continued. During that hearing, Father's counsel noted that
 
Father was previously defaulted on Maui for not appearing, but
 
Father's counsel only requested an expedited visit since Father
 
was presently incarcerated. Since January 11, 2010, Father
 
and/or his court appointed counsel attended every hearing before
 
the family court. Father also participated in the trial to
 
terminate his parental rights. Father waited until his closing
 
argument at trial before asserting a claim of lack of personal
 
jurisdiction. Therefore, Father's claim that the family court
 
lacked personal jurisdiction over him was waived.
