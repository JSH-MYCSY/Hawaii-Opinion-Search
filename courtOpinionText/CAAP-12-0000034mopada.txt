OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JOSEPH VAIMILI, Defendant-Appellee,
and
 
FREEDOM BAIL BONDS, Surety-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0410)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Surety-Appellant Freedom Bail Bonds (Freedom) appeals
 
from the "Findings Of Fact, Conclusions Of Law, And Order Denying
 
Freedom Bail Bonds' Motion For Relief From Judgment Of Forfeiture
 
Of Bail Bond" entered December 13, 2011 in the Circuit Court of
 
1
the First Circuit  (circuit court).
On appeal, Freedom contends the circuit court erred
 
when it:
 
1
 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided. 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) concluded Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 60(b) did not apply to bond forfeiture proceedings; and 
(2) denied Freedom's HRCP Rule 60(b) motion and
 
violated Freedom's right to due process. 
The circuit court set bail at $250,000 for Joseph
 
Vaimili (Vaimili), who was charged with Kidnapping, Terroristic
 
Threatening in the First Degree, Promoting Prostitution in the
 
First Degree, and Carrying or Use of a Firearm in the Commission
 
of a Separate Felony. On July 23, 2009, Freedom posted a bail
 
bond of $250,000 for Vaimili. After numerous continuances, trial
 
was set to commence June 23, 2010. On June 23, 2010, Vaimili
 
failed to appear. The circuit court then issued a bench warrant
 
for Vaimili's arrest, set a "cash only" bail at $250,000, and
 
issued a Bond Forfeiture.
 
On June 28, 2010, the circuit court entered a Judgment
 
of Forfeiture of Bail Bond and Freedom received notice of the
 
judgment on July 6, 2010. On July 27, 2010, Freedom filed a
 
motion to set aside the bond forfeiture judgment. At the August
 
9, 2010 hearing, Vaimili had not yet been located and the circuit
 
court denied Freedom's motion and ordered immediate execution of
 
the bond. The circuit court entered the "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [Freedom's] Motion to Set
 
Aside Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond" on August
 
16, 2010. On September 16, 2010, Freedom filed a Notice of
 
Appeal with this court, which was subsequently dismissed for lack
 
of appellate jurisdiction on December 30, 2010.
 
On June 27, 2011, Freedom filed a "Motion For Relief
 
From Judgment of Forfeiture Of Bail Bond" pursuant to HRCP Rules
 
7 and 60(b). At the July 5, 2011 hearing, Vaimili had still not
 
been located. The circuit court entered the "Order Denying
 
2
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[Freedom's] Motion for Relief From Judgment Of Forfeiture Of Bail
 
Bond" on July 18, 2011.
 
In October 2011, federal authorities arrested Vaimili 
and returned him to Hawai' i. Freedom filed a second motion for 
relief of bond forfeiture judgment pursuant to HRCP Rules 7 and 60(b) on November 2, 2011. The circuit court heard Freedom's 
motion on November 22, 2011 and entered the "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [Freedom's] Motion For 
Relief From Judgment Of Forfeiture of Bail Bond" (December 2011 
Order) on December 13, 2011. 
On January 10, 2012, Freedom filed a Notice of Appeal
 
from the December 2011 Order.
 
Freedom contends the circuit court erred by concluding
 
HRCP Rule 60(b) did not apply to bond forfeiture proceedings due
 
to the criminal nature of the suit.
 
HRCP Rule 1 provides in relevant part, "[t]hese rules
 
govern the procedure in the circuit courts of the State in all
 
suits of a civil nature whether cognizable as cases at law or in
 
equity, with the exceptions stated in Rule 81." HRCP Rule 1
 
(emphasis added). HRCP Rule 81 provides in relevant part,
 
Rule 81. APPLICABILITY.
 
(a) To what proceedings not applicable.  Except as
expressly otherwise provided in this Rule 81 or another rule
of court, these rules shall not apply to the following
proceedings (pursuant to specific provisions of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes when cited below) in any circuit court:
 
. . . .
 
(8) Proceedings for the forfeiture of bonds under
section 709-51, as the same may be renumbered[.]

 The State legislature recodified HRS § 709-51 as HRS § 804-51
effective January 1, 1973. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws 139. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 81(a)(8) (emphasis added). HRCP Rule 1 together with
 
HRCP Rule 81(a) expressly confirm that the HRCP do not apply to
 
bond forfeiture proceedings. 
Furthermore, HRCP does not apply where Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (Supp. 2012) addresses matters regarding
 
bail forfeiture, including the process to challenge a judgment of
 
bond forfeiture. HRS § 804-51 provides in relevant part, 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any bond
or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shall
immediately enter up judgment in favor of the State and
against the principal or principals and surety or sureties
on the bond, jointly and severally, for the full amount of
the penalty thereof, and shall cause execution to issue
thereon immediately after the expiration of thirty days from
the date that the notice is given via personal service or
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the surety or
sureties on the bond, of the entry of the judgment in favor
of the State, unless before the expiration of thirty days
from the date that the notice is given to the surety or
sureties on the bond of the entry of judgment in favor of
the State, a motion or application of the principal or
principals, surety or sureties, . . . showing good cause why
execution should not issue upon the judgment, is filed with
the court. . . . If the motion or application, after a
hearing held thereon, is overruled, execution shall
forthwith issue and shall not be stayed unless the order
overruling the motion or application is appealed from as in
the case of a final judgment.
 
HRS § 804-51 (emphases added). HRS § 804-51 establishes the 
exclusive means for an aggrieved party to seek relief from a 
judgment of forfeiture through a motion showing good cause. If 
that motion is denied, the statute prescribes the means for the 
challenging party to appeal the motion. Under HRCP 81(f) "Rule 
4(a) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure, shall apply to 
appeals (1) from a circuit court in proceedings listed in [HRCP Rule 81(a)]." HRCP Rule 81(f). As previously noted, HRCP Rule 
81(a) includes bond forfeiture under HRS § 804-51. HRS § 804-51, 
with HRCP Rule 81(f), expressly defines the procedure to obtain 
relief from a judgment of forfeiture through the appeals process. 
As such, the circuit court correctly ascertained Freedoms' 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reliance on HRCP Rule 60(b) misplaced within bond forfeiture
 
proceedings. 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Freedom's Rule 60(b) motion.
 
Freedom's other arguments are equally unpersuasive and
 
without merit.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Findings Of Fact, Conclusions Of Law,
 
And Order Denying Freedom Bail Bonds' Motion For Relief From
 
Judgment Of Forfeiture Of Bail Bond" entered December 13, 2011 in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
