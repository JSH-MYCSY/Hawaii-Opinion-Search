SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Association of Apartment Owners of
 
Makaha Valley Plantation (AOAO) appeals from an "Order on
 
Commissioner's Motion for Instructions" (Order re Commissioner's
 Motion) filed on September 28, 2011, and an "Order Denying [the
 AOAO's] Motion for Reconsideration of Order on Commissioner's
 Motion for Instructions and/or for Certification Pursuant to
 [Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule] 54(b)" (Order Denying  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Reconsideration) filed on December 15, 2011, in the Circuit Court
 
of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
 
Both orders stem from the AOAO's assertion of a right
 
to recover outstanding common expenses, owed on a condominium
 unit, by way of a special assessment authorized by Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 514B-146(g) (2006) against a person who
 purchases the unit in a judicial foreclosure. Here, in the Order
 re Commissioner's Motion, the circuit court ruled that, under
 HRS § 667-3 (1993), the AOAO's nonjudicial foreclosure on the
 unit extinguished its right to collect the special assessment
 from a purchaser. On appeal, the AOAO asserts the circuit court
 erred in relying on HRS § 667-3 because at the time of the AOAO's
 foreclosure, the statute did not apply to nonjudicial
 foreclosures or special assessments. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant legal authorities, we vacate the Order re
 Commissioner's Motion and the Order Denying Reconsideration.
I. Background
 
In October 2009, Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National 
Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Securities 
Corporation Trust 2006-WF1 (U.S. Bank), initiated judicial foreclose proceedings on a condominium unit located in Wai
'anae, 
Hawai'i (Unit) pursuant to a mortgage executed by the unit 
owners, John Robert Bautista and Maureen Palanggoy Bautista. Nearly a year later, the AOAO filed a "Notice of Lien and Notice of Special Assessment Lien" (Notice) on the Unit in the Office of Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of Hawai
'i 
(Land Court) (Doc. No. 4004350). The Notice identified two separate liens: one for "[a]mounts assessed and unpaid up to and including September 21, 2010 are $6,660.56[;]" and another for a special assessment lien pursuant to HRS § 514B-146 (2006 and 2009

Supp.), "being the total amount of unpaid regular monthly common
 
assessments during the six months immediately preceding the
 completion of a judicial or non-judicial power of sale
 foreclosure, however, the amount of such special assessment will
 not exceed $3,600.00." 
While U.S. Bank's judicial foreclosure proceeding was
 
pending, the AOAO conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure on the Unit
 as authorized under HRS § 514B-146. On January 11, 2011, the
 AOAO filed in the Land Court an affidavit of nonjudicial
 foreclosure under power of sale (Doc. No. 4037895) which provides
 that the AOAO acquired title to the Unit subject to U.S. Bank's
 mortgage. 
Subsequently, U.S. Bank conducted a public auction in
 
its judicial foreclosure at which it was the high bidder. At the
 hearing on the motion to confirm the sale, bidding was reopened
 and Jimmy Wu (Wu) submitted the highest bid. On June 20, 2011,
 the circuit court entered an order that inter alia confirmed the
 sale of the Unit to Wu. While the sale of the Unit to Wu was in
 escrow, the AOAO asserted a right to a special assessment in the
 amount of $5,519.32. Johnson S. Chen, acting commissioner in the
 judicial foreclosure, filed a motion with the circuit court
 requesting instruction on what to do with the AOAO's request for
 payment of a special assessment. The circuit court ruled that,
 pursuant to HRS § 667-3, the AOAO extinguished all of its claimed
 liens on the Unit when it purchased the Unit at its own
 nonjudicial foreclosure.
II. Special Assessment
 The AOAO asserts that the circuit court erred because
 
the version of HRS § 667-3 effective at the time of the AOAO's
 
foreclosure did not apply to nonjudicial foreclosures and did not
 extinguish subsequent special assessments.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
U.S. Bank responds that HRS § 667-3 expressly provides
 
that the AOAO extinguished all other liens on the Unit.2
 
However, U.S. Bank concedes that if HRS § 667-3 does not apply,
 
the AOAO has the statutory right pursuant to HRS § 514B-146(g) to
 seek a special assessment from a purchaser of the Unit at the
 judicial foreclosure. 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of
law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.
 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following
well established principle[]:
 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature,
which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself.
 
Lingle v. Hawaii Gov't Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 
107 Hawai 'i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (citation 
omitted). 
We agree with the AOAO that at the time of the AOAO's
 
nonjudicial foreclosure, the applicable version of HRS § 667-3
 did not preclude the AOAO's subsequent recovery of a special
 assessment. The nonjudicial foreclosure was completed once the
 affidavit was filed with the Land Court. See HRS §§ 667-5 to -10
 
(1993 and 2010 Supp.). The AOAO filed its affidavit on
 January 11, 2011. At that time, HRS § 667-3 did not contain any
 language whereby a nonjudicial foreclosure extinguished liens. 
It read, in pertinent part, "[m]ortgage creditors shall be
 entitled to payment according to the priority of their liens, and
 not pro rata; and judgments of foreclosure shall operate to
 extinguish the liens of subsequent mortgages of the same
 property, without forcing prior mortgagees to their right of
 recovery." HRS § 667-3 (emphasis added). Judgments of
 
2
 U.S. Bank also seems to argue that the AOAO already foreclosed on the
 
special assessment lien through its nonjudicial foreclosure, thus precluding
its subsequent assertion of a right to collect. However, U.S. Bank
contradictorily concedes in briefing that the AOAO's right to collect from Wu
(or any subsequent purchaser) had not arisen as of the time of the AOAO's
nonjudicial foreclosure. U.S. Bank does not explain how the AOAO could have
foreclosed on a special assessment lien prior to a legal right to collect a
special assessment. Thus, U.S. Bank defeats its own argument.

foreclosure are entered in judicial foreclosures and are not part
 
of a nonjudicial foreclosure. See HRS §§ 667-1, -5 (1993 & Supp.
 
2010). Additionally, HRS § 667-3 only extinguished mortgage
 liens, and the AOAO's lien pursuant to HRS § 514B-146 is not
 based on a mortgage, but rather outstanding common expenses owed
 on the Unit. See HRS § 514B-146; HRS § 667-40 (2013 Supp.). 
Therefore, the circuit court erred in relying on HRS § 667-3 as
 constituted at the time of the AOAO's nonjudicial foreclosure.

As stated above, U.S. Bank admits that if HRS § 667-3
 
does not apply, the AOAO had the right to collect the special
 assessment from the judicial foreclosure purchaser of the Unit.
 Both parties appear to agree that the AOAO's right to a special
 assessment arose under HRS § 514B-146(g)(2). At the time
 relevant to this case, HRS § 514B-146(g) read in pertinent part:
 
(g) 	Subject to this subsection, and subsections (h) and
(i), the board may specially assess the amount of the
unpaid regular monthly common assessments for common
expenses against the person who, in a judicial or
nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure, purchases a
delinquent unit; provided that:
 
3 U.S. Bank correctly points out that as of May 5, 2011 (2011 Haw.
Sess. Laws Act 48, § 45 at 117), HRS § 667-3 was amended as follows: 
§667-3 Proceeds, how applied. Mortgage and other
creditors shall be entitled to payment according to the
priority of their liens, and not pro rata; and judgments of
foreclosure and foreclosures by power of sale that are
conducted in compliance with this part and for which an
affidavit is recorded as required under section 667-5 shall
operate to extinguish the liens of subsequent mortgages and
liens of the same property, without forcing prior mortgagees
or lienors to their right of recovery. The surplus after
payment of the mortgage foreclosed, shall be applied pro
tanto to the next junior mortgage[,] or lien, and so on to
the payment, wholly or in part, of mortgages and liens
junior to the one assessed.
 
2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 48, § 16 at 103. However, the AOAO filed its
affidavit finalizing the nonjudicial foreclosure on January 11, 2011, prior to
the amendment of HRS § 667-3. It is a "well-established rule of construction"
 that statutes apply retroactively only with clearly expressed legislative
intent. Yamaguchi v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 65 Haw. 84, 89, 648 P.2d 689, 693
 
(1982). The legislature expressed no such intent in this instance.
 
Further, we note that in 2012, the legislature again amended HRS § 667-3
to delete the language providing that "foreclosures by power of sale"
extinguish the liens of subsequent mortgages and liens of the same property.
2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 12 at 658-59.

. . . .
 
(2)	 . . . the mortgagee or subsequent purchaser may
require the association to provide at no charge
a notice of the association's intent to claim
 lien against the delinquent unit for the amount
of the special assessment, prior to the
subsequent purchaser's acquisition of title to
the delinquent unit. The notice shall state the
amount of the special assessment, how that
amount was calculated, and the legal description
of the unit.
 
Emphasis added. The legislature included the notice provision
 
because "[it] is only fair, [to require the association to]
 provid[e] the purchaser with actual notice of the total amount of
 the delinquencies." 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 39, § 1 at 69. 
The AOAO's notice of special assessment lien served as
 
notice of "an intent to claim lien against the delinquent unit"
 in an amount not to exceed $3,600.00. The stated ceiling of
 $3,600.00 was in line with the version of HRS § 514B-146 in
 effect at the time the lien was filed (September 30, 2010). See
 
HRS § 514B-146(h). The legislature subsequently raised the limit
 on special assessments to $7,200 effective on May 5, 2011, see
 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 48, §§ 14 & 45, at 103, 117, but the
 AOAO did not amend its notice. The AOAO only gave notice of a
 special assessment "not [to] exceed $3,600.00[,]" and thus should
 be limited to collecting up to that amount.
 
In sum, therefore, the circuit court erred in
 
concluding that HRS § 667-3 precluded recovery of the special
 assessment in this case. The AOAO properly asserted a right to
 collect a special assessment from the purchaser of the Unit via
 U.S. Bank's judicial foreclosure, but only in an amount "not [to]
 exceed $3,600.00." 
III. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the "Order on 
Commissioner's Motion for Instructions" filed on September 28, 
2011, and the "Order Denying [the AOAO's] Motion for Reconsideration of Order on Commissioner's Motion for Instructions and/or for Certification Pursuant to [Hawai

of Civil Procedure Rule] 54(b)" filed on December 15, 2011, in
