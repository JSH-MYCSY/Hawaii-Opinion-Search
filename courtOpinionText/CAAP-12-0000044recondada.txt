MARY LOU JACK, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
THOMAS EDWARD JACK, II, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 10-1-0269)

 
ORDER DENYING MARCH 4, 2015
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION

OF FEBRUARY 26, 2015 SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Attorney Donna Davis Green's 
(Attorney Green) March 4, 2015 motion for reconsideration, of the 
February 26, 2015 Summary Disposition Order, (2) the February 26, 2015 Summary Disposition Order, and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook or misapprehend any points of fact or law when we included footnote 3 in the Summary Disposition Order. Hawai
'i Family Court Rule 87(a) does not excuse an attorney who 
has received a notice of appeal from opposing counsel from notifying the appellate court that he or she is no longer counsel for the appellee. This is especially true where, as here, silence on appellee's counsel's part led to the continued service NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of documents to appellee's counsel rather than to appellee
 
herself. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the March 4, 2015 motion for
 
reconsideration of the February 26, 2015 Summary Disposition
 Order in case number CAAP-12-0000044 is denied.
