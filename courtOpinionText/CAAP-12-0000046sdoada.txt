 Travis actually appeals from the January 19, 2012 Order Denying
his Motion to Reconsider Order Affirming Commission's Final Order. However,
as "a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should not result in [the]loss of the appeal as long as the intention to appeal from a specific judgmentcan be fairly inferred form the notice and the appellee is not misled by themistake." State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai' i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal before this court, Travis maintains that the
 
Circuit Court erred in affirming the Commission's Final Order
 
because the Commission: (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction
 and (2) wrongfully revoked his license by concluding that his
 conduct violated Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 436B-19(12)
 (2013), 467-14(8) (2013), and 467-14(20) (2013).
 
After reviewing the record on appeal, the points
 
raised, the parties' arguments and the applicable legal
 authority, we resolve Travis's points as follows and affirm.
 
1. The Commission had jurisdiction to revoke Travis's 
license. "The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of a cause of action." Lingle v. Hawaii Gov't Emps. Ass'n, 
AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 Hawai
'i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 
591 (2005) (citation omitted); see also, HRS § 91-14(g)(2) (2012) (providing for judicial review of an agency's decision in a contested case for jurisdictional defects). The Commission had jurisdiction over Travis's real estate license pursuant to HRS §§ 26-9(b) (2009), 92-17(b) (2012), 467-4 (2013), and 467-14 (2013). Travis's arguments regarding HRS § 831-3.1(b) (Supp. 2013) do not deprive the jurisdiction of the Commission to revoke a real estate broker's license. 
2. The Commission did not err in its conclusion that
 
Travis's conduct violated the statutes governing his real estate
 license.
 
If the legislature has granted the agency discretion over a
particular matter, then we review the agency's action
pursuant to the deferential abuse of discretion standard
(bearing in mind the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion).
 
Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai 'i 412, 419-20, 91 
P.3d 494, 501-02 (2004). Travis argues that the Commission erred 
in concluding that his conduct violated HRS §§ 436B-19(12), 467­14(8), and 467-14(20). We disagree. 
a. HRS § 436B-19(12) provides that the licensing
 
authority may revoke a license due to "[f]ailure to comply,
 observe, or adhere to any law in a manner such that the licensing
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority deems the applicant or holder to be an unfit or
 
improper person to hold a license[.]"
 
The conclusions of law set forth in the Hearing
 
Officer's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Conclusions of
 Law), later adopted by the Commission, were as follows:
 
[Travis] does not dispute that he failed to comply
with the applicable tax laws that formed the basis for his
Criminal Case. Rather, [Travis] argues that his
noncompliance was not done in a manner such that the
 
Commission can deem him to be an unfit or improper person to
hold a license in violation of HRS § 436B-19(12).
 
The undisputed evidence, however, was more than
sufficient to justify such a conclusion. [Travis's]
intentional evasion of his tax obligations over a number of
years, the filing of a false tax return, and the filing of
multiple, frivolous lawsuit[s] against the federal
government, raise genuine and serious concerns over
[Travis's] honesty and integrity. Moreover, [Travis's]
well-documented and ongoing delusional behavior and his
obvious willingness to act upon them even to the detriment
of his family, certainly raise the potential for consumer
harm and cannot be ignored.
 
While Travis argues the significance of these described
 
events, he has not disputed these facts. We cannot find error in
 
the conclusion that Travis's license should be revoked pursuant
 to HRS § 436B-19(12).
 
b. 
HRS § 467-14(8) provides that "the commission may
 
revoke any license issued under this chapter . . . for any cause
 authorized by law, including but not limited to . . . [a]ny other
 conduct constituting fraudulent or dishonest dealings[.]"
 
The Conclusions of Law set forth as follows:

 
[W]ith respect to HRS §467-14(8), [Travis] contends that his
misguided protest of the tax laws does not amount to
"fraudulent or dishonest dealings" relevant to real estate
transactions. [Travis] apparently argues that the numerous
letters in support of his good character are enough to raise
a genuine issue of material fact for hearing. Even viewing
those letter[s] in [the] light most favorable to [Travis,]
however, the fact of the matter is that the circumstances
upon which [Travis] was convicted were undoubtedly
fraudulent and dishonest and beyond any genuine dispute.
 
We cannot find error in the conclusion that Travis was
 
unfit to hold a license pursuant to HRS § 467-14(8) in light of
 
the evidence that he intentionally evaded tax obligations over a
 few decades, filed a false tax return, and filed frivolous
 lawsuits against the federal government.

c. HRS § 467-14(20) provides that "the commission may
 
revoke any license issued under this chapter . . . for any cause

 
authorized by law, including but not limited to . . . [f]ailure
 
to maintain a reputation for or record of competency, honesty,
 truthfulness, financial integrity, and fair dealing[.]"
 
The conclusions of law set forth as follows:
 
[Travis] also points to the numerous letters he
attached to his responsive brief that support [Travis's]
good character, and argues that those letters are sufficient
to raise a genuine issue of material fact for hearing in
connection with his reputation. Notwithstanding those
letters, [Travis's] criminal conviction is of record and
that conviction together with the nature of that conviction
constitutes a failure to maintain a record of honesty and
truthfulness.
 
Additionally, as discussed earlier, the uncontroverted
evidence also raises a serious concern over [Travis's]
competency. The uncontroverted opinions of two
professionals along with [Travis's] continued delusions and
willingness to act upon them also lead the Hearings Officer
to conclude that [Travis] has failed to maintain a record of
competency.
 
(footnote omitted).
 
The nature of Travis's actions raises serious concerns
 
regarding his honesty and financial integrity. His intentional
 
evasion of tax obligations over an extensive period of time,
 filing of a false tax return, and filing of frivolous lawsuits
 against the federal government all exhibit his failure to
 maintain a record of honesty, truthfulness, financial integrity,
 and fair dealing. See HRS § 467-14(20). Moreover, Travis's
 
treating psychiatrist's concern over Travis's ongoing delusions
 and willingness to act upon them raise serious concerns over his
 competency to hold a real estate license and ability to freely
 interact with the general public.
 
d. Travis raises four additional arguments in his 
opening brief but fails to include them in his points of error. We may disregard points not presented in accordance with Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). ("Points not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may notice a plain error not presented."). Nevertheless, we address these additional arguments and find them to be without merit. See 
Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai
'i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) 
(substantial compliance "where the remaining sections of the 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
brief provide the necessary information to identify the party's
 
argument").
 
First, Travis argues that his procedural due process 
rights were violated. "At its core, procedural due process of law requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner before governmental deprivation of a significant liberty interest." State v. Bani, 97 Hawai
'i 285, 293, 36 P.3d 1255, 1263 (2001). "However, we have 
repeatedly recognized that due process is not a fixed concept requiring a specific procedural course in every situation. Instead, due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." Id. at 296, 36 
P.3d at 1266 (internal citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Here, Travis participated in the administrative 
hearing, presented evidence, and appealed the Commission's Final Order, arguing before the Circuit Court. Any argument that Travis did not receive sufficient notice of the charge based upon HRS § 467-14(20) due to the erroneous citation to HRS § 467-14(2) when the text of the proper provision was quoted in the petition is without merit. Under these circumstances, Travis was provided with sufficient notice and the opportunity to be heard. See 
Bani, 97 Hawai
'i at 293, 36 P.3d at 1263. 
Second, Travis argues in the alternative, that the
 
Commission's Final Order was obtained via unclean hands, stating,
 "When it chose to ignore HRS § 831-3.1 and cite only four general
 statutes to claim that REC had SMJ, the DCCA chose to violate
 Travis' due process rights." However, as discussed above, the
 Commission had jurisdiction over Travis's real estate license and
 did not violate his due process rights. Moreover, Travis
 provides no evidentiary support for his allegations of bad faith.
 
Third, Travis argues that HRS §§ 436B-19(12), 467­
14(8), and 467-14(20) are unconstitutional as they "interfered with both his free exercise of religion as well as his right to free speech; i.e., his tax protest." The Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
"has consistently held that every enactment of the legislature is presumptively constitutional, and a party challenging the statute has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
doubt. The infraction should be plain, clear, manifest, and 
unmistakable." Kaho'ohanohano v. State,  114 Hawai 'i 302, 339, 162 
P.3d 696, 733 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Travis fails to carry his burden to demonstrate how his constitutional rights to free speech or freedom of religion were violated. 
Finally, in light of our rejection of Travis's

 
arguments, we reject his conclusory contention that even if the
 above arguments are individually insufficient, they are
 cumulatively convincing.
 
Accordingly, in light of our circumscribed role in this 
secondary appeal, see Befitel, 104 Hawai
'i at 416, 91 P.3d at 
498, we do not find error. 
Based on the foregoing, the December 15, 2011 Judgment
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
