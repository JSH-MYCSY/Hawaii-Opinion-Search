NO. CAAP-12-0000049
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LOUIS PALAMA, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0283)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Louis Palama (Palama) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence (Judgment)
 
entered on January 19, 2012, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court).  Judgment was entered against Palama
 
for (1) Driving a Motor Vehicle without a Valid Driver's License,
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 286-102 (2007 &
 
Supp. 2012) and (2) Conditions of Operation and Registration of
 
Motor Vehicles, in violation of HRS ยง 431:10C-104 (2005 Repl.). 
Palama's point of error on appeal is that the circuit
 
court erred by not allowing him to present evidence of the
 
existence of the Kingdom of Atooi. 
Although the circuit court

allowed some evidence in this regard, it limited the evidence
 
that could be presented.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Palama's
 
appeal as follows:
 
Palama asks this court to reconsider its decision in 
State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 101 P.3d 652 (App. 2004) to 
the extent necessary "to reverse his convictions or, in the alternative, to vacate and remand to the circuit court with 
instructions that the court find that he has a valid registration 
and driver's license issued by the Kingdom [of Atooi], and no 
obligation to carry motor vehicle insurance within the Kingdom." 
As Palama correctly acknowledged, in Fergerstrom this
 
court held that
 
the State of Hawai' i has lawful jurisdiction over all
persons operating motor vehicles on public roads or highways
within the State of Hawai' i. Persons claiming to be citizens
of the Kingdom of Hawai' i and not of the State of Hawai' i are 
not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai' i applicable
to all persons (citizens and non-citizens) operating motor
vehicles on public roads and highways within the State of
Hawai'i. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i at 55, 101 P.3d at 664. Similarly, a 
person claiming to be a citizen of the Kingdom of Atooi is not 
exempt from the motor vehicle laws of the State of Hawai' i. 
Recently, and subsequent to Fergerstrom, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court, in State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i 479, 291 P.3d 377 
(2013), reaffirmed that an individual claiming to be a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai' i rather than a citizen of the State is not 
exempt from the State's laws. The supreme court ruled as follows: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the court's
jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the Kingdom
government. In that regard, we reaffirm that "[w]hatever

may be said regarding the lawfulness" of its origins, "the
State of Hawai' i ... is now, a lawful government." State v. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 
(App.2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004).
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and notof the State are not exempt from application of the State'slaws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App.1994); State v. French, 77 
Hawai'i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App.1994); Nishitani v. Baker, 82 
Hawai'i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.1996); State v. Lee, 90 
Hawai'i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385. The supreme court in Kaulia thus 
rejected the defendant's argument that the lower court should 
have allowed him to call a witness to present evidence of the 
existence of the Kingdom of Hawai' i to support a motion to 
dismiss. Id. at 482, 487, 291 P.3d at 380, 385. Consistent with Fergerstrom and Kaulia, Palama is not
 
exempt from application of the State's laws and the circuit court
 did not err in limiting the evidence that he could present
 
regarding the existence of the Kingdom of Atooi.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence entered on January 19, 2012, in the
 Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
