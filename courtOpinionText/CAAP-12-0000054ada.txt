OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
In this secondary appeal of an administrative agency 
decision, Petitioners-Appellants Thomas E. Fratinardo and Joseph 
Self, Jr. (Petitioners) appeal from the Final Judgment entered 
January 24, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 
(circuit court). The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Respondent-Appellee the Employees' Retirement System of the State 
of Hawai' i (ERS) and against Petitioners pursuant to the circuit 
court's "Order Affirming the Final Decision of the Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of the State of 
Hawai'i and Dismissing Appeal" (Order), entered January 20, 2012. 
On appeal, Petitioners contend the circuit court erred
 
in affirming the ERS's construction of "compensation" to exclude
 
the car, firearm, and uniform allowances paid to Petitioners in
 
calculating Petitioners' retirement benefits.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Petitioners are retired police officers. Self retired
 
in 2002, and Fratinardo retired in 2004. During their
 
employment, in addition to their salaries, they received car,
 
uniform, and firearm allowances. The car allowance was a fixed
 
payment of $488 per month provided to police officers who were
 
required by the employer to purchase and regularly use their
 
private automobiles for official duty. The allowance amount did
 
not vary based on the type of car owned, how much the car was
 
driven, or any other cost of operation, maintenance, or ownership
 
to the Petitioners. The uniform and firearm allowances were also
 
fixed payments but were paid only once per year until 1994. In

 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1994, under a new collective bargaining agreement between the 
State of Hawai' i Organization of Police Officers (SHOPO) and 
Petitioners' employers, the uniform and firearm allowances were classified as a "Standard of Conduct Differential" (SOCD) and 
were paid monthly at a fixed rate. The allowances and the SOCD 
were benefits guaranteed by the collective bargaining agreements 
and could not be changed without union approval. 
As police officers, Petitioners were members of ERS's
 
state and county pension plan and were required to contribute
 
12.2% of their "compensation" to the retirement plan. Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 88-42 (Supp. 1994) and 88-45 (1993). 
Pursuant to HRS § 88-46 (Supp. 1997), Petitioners' employers
 
deducted Petitioners' contributions from their paychecks and
 
transmitted them to ERS. It is undisputed that Petitioners and
 
their employers did not make any contributions to ERS for the
 
amounts Petitioners received for the car, uniform, and firearm
 
allowances. When Petitioners retired, ERS calculated their
 
pension benefits and did not include the car, uniform, or firearm
 
allowances as compensation.
 
Petitioners then filed a Petition for Declaratory
 
Relief to ERS, arguing ERS had improperly denied them higher
 
retirement benefits by excluding the uniform, firearm, and car
 
allowances from the calculation of their retirement benefits. 
The ERS hearing officer heard oral arguments and issued a
 
Recommended Decision concluding Petitioners had "failed to carry
 
their burden of proof and burden of persuasion in seeking to
 
establish that the ERS had violated HRS Chapter 88 [(1993)],
 
particularly HRS §§ 88-45 and 88-81, by excluding car, uniform
 
maintenance, and firearm maintenance allowances" from the
 
calculation of their retirement benefits. Pursuant to ERS

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4administrative rules, the Board of Trustees of the Employees'
Retirement System of the State of Hawai #i (Board) issued a
Proposed Decision adopting the hearing officer's Recommended
Decision with minor modifications.
Both parties filed exceptions to the Proposed Decision,
which were argued to the Board on February 14, 2011.  The Board
then issued its Final Decision affirming the Proposed Decision
and adopting the Recommended Decision, including the hearing
officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law, with further
modifications.  The Board concluded "compensation" as used in HRS
Chapter 88 is "pay or salary that is tied to services rendered
and not reimbursement for employee expenses."  The Board
determined the car, uniform, and firearm allowances were cost
reimbursements and were not tied to services rendered, and
therefore the allowances should not be considered "compensation"
in calculating Petitioners' retirement benefits.
Petitioners appealed the Board's Final Decision to the
circuit court.  After hearing oral argument on December 21, 2011,
the circuit court entered its Order affirming the Board's Final
Decision and dismissing the appeal.  The court then entered the
Final Judgment on the Order, from which Petitioners timely
appealed to this court.
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
A.Secondary Appeal
"'Review of a decision made by a court upon its review
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal.  The
standard of review is one in which [the appellate] court
must determine whether the court under review was right or
wrong in its decision.'"  Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals of County
of Hawaii, 109 Hawai# i 384, 391, 126 P.3d 1071, 1078 (2006)
(quoting Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai# i
296, 306-07, 97 P.3d 372, 382-83 (2004) (other citation
omitted)).  The standards as set forth in HRS § 91-14(g)
(1993) are applied to the agency's decision.  Ka Pa# akai OFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ka'aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai' i 31, 40, 7 P.3d 1068,
1077 (2000). HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
"'Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewableunder subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regardingprocedural defects under subsection (3); findings of factunder subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion
under subsection (6).'" Sierra Club v. Office of Planning,

B.Deference to Administrative Agency Decision
In determining whether an agency determination should
be given deference, the standard to be applied is as
follows:
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrative
agency, we first decide whether the legislature
granted the agency discretion to make the
determination being reviewed.  If the legislature has
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then we review the agency's action pursuant to
the deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearing
in mind that the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion).  If the legislature has not
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then the agency's conclusions are subject to
de novo review.

Olelo:  The Corp. for Cmty. Television v. Office of Info.
Practices, 116 Hawai #i 337, 344, 173 P.3d 484, 491 (2007).
"[I]n deference to the administrative agency's
expertise and experience in its particular field, the courts
should not substitute their own judgment for that of the
administrative agency where mixed questions of fact and law are
presented.  This is particularly true where the law to be applied
is not a statute but an administrative rule promulgated by the
same agency interpreting it."  Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212,
216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984) (citation omitted).
C.Statutory Interpretation
The interpretation of a statute is a question of
law that is reviewed de novo.FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself. And we must read statutory language in the
context of the entire statute and construe it in a
 manner consistent with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists[.]
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning
of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the
context with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their
true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to
extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent. One
 avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the
reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which
induced the legislature to enact it [] to discover its
true meaning. Laws in pari materia, or upon the same
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to
each other. What is clear in one statute may be
called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in
another.
 
Morgan v. Planning Dep't, County of Kaua' i, 104 Hawai' i 173,
179-80, 86 P.3d 982, 988-89 (2004) (citations and internalquotation marks omitted). 
[W]here an administrative agency is charged with the
responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a
statute which contains words of broad and indefinite
 meaning, courts accord persuasive weight to
administrative construction and follow the same,
unless the construction is palpably erroneous.
 
Id. at 180, 86 P.3d at 989 (citing Ka Pa' akai O Ka ' Aina v. 
Land Use Comm'n, State of Hawai' i, 94 Hawai' i 31, 41, 7 P.3d
1068, 1078 (2000)). Stated differently: 
Where an agency is statutorily responsible for
carrying out the mandate of a statute which contains
broad or ambiguous language, that agency's
interpretation and application of the statute is
generally accorded judicial deference on appellate
review. Vail v. Employees' Retirement System, 75 Haw.
42, 59, 856 P.2d 1227, 1237 (1993). However, an
interpretation by an agency of a statute it
administers is not entitled to deference if the
 interpretation is plainly erroneous and inconsistent

III. DISCUSSION
 
This appeal turns on the meaning of the word
 
"compensation" as used in HRS Chapter 88 and whether the car,
 
firearm, and uniform allowances constitute compensation. We
 
apply the following principles in construing statutes:
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there
is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or
uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity
exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguous statute, the
meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining
the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true
meaning.
 
Estate of Roxas v. Marcos, 121 Hawai' i 59, 66, 214 P.3d 598, 605 
(2009) (quoting Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 256, 
195 P.3d 1177, 1188 (2008)). 
Pursuant to HRS § 88-74(1) (Supp. 2002), the formula
 
for calculating a police officer's retirement benefits is:
 
average final compensation x years of credited service x 2.5%. 
In relevant part, HRS § 88-81(a) (2002) defined "average final
 
compensation" as "the average annual compensation pay or salary
 
upon which a member has made contributions as required by
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sections 88-45 and 88-46." HRS § 88-45 required Petitioners to
 
"contribute twelve and two-tenths per cent of their compensation
 
to the annuity savings fund for service in that capacity."
 
At the time Petitioners retired, HRS Chapter 88 did not 
define "compensation," and there is no administrative rule or 
case law interpreting the term. In its Final Decision, the Board 
construed "compensation" as "pay or salary that is tied to 
services rendered and not reimbursement for employee expenses[,]" 
and it concluded the car, uniform, and firearm allowances were 
reimbursements. Petitioners, on the other hand, contend the 
plain and ordinary meaning of "compensation" is expansive and 
includes payments such as the car, uniform, and firearm 
allowances. Pursuant to HRS § 1-14 (1993), "[t]he words of a law 
are generally to be understood in their most known and usual 
signification," and where a term is not statutorily defined, the 
court may resort to legal or lay dictionaries to determine the 
ordinary meaning of the term. Gillan v. Gov't Employees Ins. 
Co., 119 Hawai' i 109, 115, 194 P.3d 1071, 1077 (2008). 
Petitioners cite Black's Law Dictionary, which defines 
"compensation" in the employment context as "[r]emuneration and 
other benefits received in return for services rendered; esp., 
salary or wages. . . . [Compensation] includes wages, stock 
option plans, profit-sharing, commissions, bonuses, golden 
parachutes, vacation, sick pay, medical benefits, disability, 
leaves of absence, and expense reimbursements." Black's Law 
Dictionary 322 (9th Ed. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) 
(emphases added). Consequently, Petitioners contend ERS's 
interpretation is an unjustified departure from the plain and 
unambiguous meaning of the statutory language. 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Because the parties proffer two different reasonable 
interpretations, however, we conclude the term "compensation" is 
not "plain and unambiguous." See Roxas, 121 Hawai' i at 68, 214 
P.3d at 607 ("[A] statute is ambiguous if it is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed people in two or more 
different senses."). "[I]n the case of broad or ambiguous 
statutory language, the applicable standard of review regarding 
an agency's interpretation of its own governing statute requires 
this court to defer to the agency's expertise and to follow the 
agency's construction of the statute unless that construction is 
palpably erroneous." Vail v. Employees' Ret. Sys., 75 Haw. 42, 
66, 856 P.2d 1227, 1240 (deferring to the employees' retirement system's reading of an ambiguous term in HRS § 88-43 (1993), 
because the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the reading 
was palpably erroneous). 
Although Petitioners present a plausible 
interpretation, the dictionary definition of "compensation" is 
only a starting point in ascertaining its meaning, and the plain 
language rule of statutory construction does not prelude an 
examination of other sources and of the context of the entire 
statute. Shipley v. Ala Moana Hotel, 83 Hawai' i 361, 364-65, 926 
P.2d 1284, 1287-88 (1996). Furthermore, the dictionary does not clearly set the scope of the term "compensation." For instance, 
Black's Law Dictionary indicates the definition is especially 
tied to "salary or wages." Because nothing in the statutory 
language of HRS Chapter 88 or in the legislative record directly 
corroborates Petitioners' interpretation or undermines ERS's, we 
conclude Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that ERS's 
construction is "palpably erroneous." Therefore, the circuit 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court did not err in affirming ERS's decision against
 
Petitioners.
 
When construing an ambiguous statute,
the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning. Moreover, the courts may
resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent.
One avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool. This court may also consider the reason
and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning. Laws
in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be
construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one
 
statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is
doubtful in another.
 
Roxas, 121 Hawai' i at 68, 214 P.3d at 607 (quoting In re Water 
Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 144, 9 P.3d 409, 456 
(2000). Because legislative history does not clarify the 
ambiguity in this case, we resort to other aids. 
The Board primarily based its definition on reading HRS
 
§§ 88-81 and 88-45 in pari materia. HRS § 88-81 provided, in
 
relevant part, "[a]verage final compensation is the average
 
annual compensation pay or salary[.]" Applying the doctrines of
 
2 3
noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,  ERS contends the more
 
generic term "compensation" must take its color of meaning from
 
2 "[F]reely translated as 'words of a feather flock together,' that
is, the meaning of a word is to be judged by the company it keeps." Kamalu v. 
Paren, Inc., 110 Hawai' i 269, 278 n. 10, 132 P.3d 378, 387 n. 10 (2006). See 
also HRS § 1-15(1) (1993) ("The meaning of ... ambiguous words may be soughtby examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, andsentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning."). 
3
 Where specific words follow general words in a statute, the
doctrine restricts application of the general term to things similar to thoseenumerated. Holi v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., Inc., 113 Hawai' i 196, 204, 150 P.3d
845, 853 (App. 2007). The doctrine construes all parts of a statute togetherand treats no word as superfluous, noting "[i]f the general words are giventheir full and natural meaning, they would include the objects designated bythe specific words, making the latter superfluous." Id. (quoting Sutherland 
Statutory Construction § 47.17) (5th ed. 1992). 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"pay" and "salary," and therefore the whole refers to
 
remuneration for services rendered or work performed. See
 
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1659, 2003 (1986)
 (defining pay as "to satisfy (someone) for services rendered" and
 
salary as "to pay (as a person) for something done"). ERS also
 
argues HRS Chapter 88's provisions express an overall purpose and
 
policy of providing benefits based on services rendered. See 
HRS § 88-45 (requiring officers to contribute a portion of their
 compensation "for service in that capacity"); HRS § 88-21
 
(defining "membership service" as "all service rendered by a
 
member"). The Board characterized the allowances as payments to
 
reimburse or subsidize the costs the officers incurred during
 
employment and concluded it would be "unfair and unreasonable" to
 
interpret HRS §§ 88-45 and 88-81 such that officers who used
 
their private automobiles would receive more retirement benefits
 
than officers who used county-owned or public automobiles.
 
Although the phrase "compensation pay or salary" may be
 
too short and indistinct to apply noscitur a sociis and ejusdem
 
4
generis as ERS urges,  a review of HRS Chapter 88 strengthens
ERS's case for narrowing the interpretation of "compensation." 
First, at the time Petitioners retired, the Hawai' i State 
Legislature (Legislature) did not provide a definition for any of 
5
the terms "compensation," "pay," or "salary,"  and HRS Chapter
4 See, e.g., Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. U.S.
 
ex rel. Wilson, 130 S. Ct. 1396, 1403 (2010), reh'g denied, 130 S. Ct. 3351
(2010) (rejecting application of noscitur a sociis to the phrase
"congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office," stating the
substantive connection between the terms "is not so tight or self-evident as
to demand that we 'rob' any one of them 'of its independent and ordinary
significance'").
 
5
 Effective 2012, the Legislature added a definition of
"compensation" which is discussed further below. The Legislature also added a
(continued...)
 
12
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
88's provisions do not clearly indicate the Legislature viewed
 
the terms "compensation," "pay," and "salary" as distinct terms,
 
at least at the time it enacted these provisions.6 HRS § 88-26
 
(1993) also indicates the Legislature did not view reimbursements
 as a form of compensation. HRS § 88-26 provides that ERS's
 
trustees "shall serve without compensation but they shall be
 
reimbursed from the expense fund for all necessary expenses and
 
for any loss of salary or wages they may suffer through serving
 
the board of trustees." HRS § 88-26 (emphases added). Therefore,
 
the statutory language of HRS Chapter 88 viewed in pari materia
 
supports ERS's construction, at least to such an extent to
 
justify our conclusion that ERS's position is not "palpably
 
erroneous" and is entitled to deference.
 
Moreover, the Legislature's subsequent definition of 
compensation does not alter our conclusion. The definition 
provided in HRS § 88-21.5 is not binding in this case because it 
took effect in July 7, 2004, after Petitioners retired. See Act 
182, 2004 Session Laws of Hawai' i. "Although we look to 
subsequent legislative history to confirm our interpretation of 
earlier statutory provisions, we weigh such arguments with 
extreme care." First Ins. Co. of Hawai' i, Ltd. v. Dayoan, 124 
5(...continued)
definition of "base pay" to address significant increases in an employee's
compensation immediately preceding retirement attributable to "non-base pay"
such as overtime. See HRS §§ 88-21, 88-21.5, 88-100 (Supp. 2012); Stand.
Comm. Rep. No. 3008, available at http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2012/
CommReports/HB2487_SD1_SSCR3008_.HTM. 
6
 For instance, HRS § 88-46 (Supp. 2002) uses the terms
interchangeably. HRS § 88-46 is entitled "Deducting employee contributions
from salary and employer pick up of employee contributions[,]" but the text of
the statute largely uses "compensation" throughout, stating for instance,
"[t]he head of each state department and the finance director of each county
shall deduct from the compensation of each [member][.]" HRS § 88-46(a)
(emphases added).

    FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 426, 433, 246 P.3d 358, 365 (2010) (citation omitted). 
In this case, the definition of HRS § 88-21.5 does not undermine 
ERS's interpretation and does not control our determination. 
In 2004, the Legislature made several amendments to HRS
 
Chapter 88 to conform to the requirements of section 401(a) of
 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code). Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 
2692, in 2004 Senate Journal, at 1358-59. The amendments
 
included adding a new section, section 88-21.5, which added a
 
definition of compensation to satisfy the Code's requirement that
 
a member's benefit be "definitely determinable." See 26 U.S.C.A.
 
§ 401(a) (2002) (listing requirements to constitute a qualified
 pension plan under the Code).
7 Nothing in the legislative
 
history indicates the Legislature intended to alter the content
 of "compensation" by adding this definition, and according to
 
ERS's administrator, ERS's internal working definition of what
 
was included in compensation remained unchanged. HRS § 88-21.5
 
states:
 
§88-21.5 Compensation. (a) For a member who became a
member before July 1, 2012, unless a different meaning is

(2) 	Overtime, differentials, and supplementary
payments;
 
(3) 	Bonuses and lump sum salary supplements; and
 
(4) 	Elective salary reduction contributions under
sections 125, 403(b), and 457(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
HRS § 88-21.5.
 
Both parties contend subsection (a)(2) supports their
 
respective interpretations. Petitioners claim the reference to
 
"supplementary payments" indicates the allowances should be
 
included as compensation. ERS applies ejusdem generis and
 
suggests the Legislature intended the term "supplementary
 
payments" to be related to the amount or type of services
 
provided by an employee. Overtime is "extra wages paid for
 
excess hours worked[,]" Black's Law Dictionary 1214, and
 
differentials are likewise paid based on the type of work or
 
service performed. For example, police officers receive pay
 
differentials for work performed at night; work performed under
 
unusually hazardous conditions; being subject to departmental
 
standards of conduct twenty-four hours a day; and work as a bomb
 
technician or canine handler.
 
Although again both interpretations are plausible, the
 
most recent amendment to HRS § 88-21.5 provides further support
 
to ERS's position and indicates the Legislature viewed
 
"supplementary payments" and "allowances" as distinct and
 
separate forms of payment. In 2012, the Legislature enacted Act
 
152, which amended the definition of "compensation" for those who
 
become members after June 30, 2012 by excluding "additional or
 
extra payments" from compensation. Thus, the Legislature added 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subsection (b) to HRS § 88-21.5, which provides:
 
§88-21.5 Compensation.
. . . .
 
(b) For a member who becomes a member after June 30, 2012,
unless a different meaning is plainly required by context,
"compensation" as used in this part: 
. . . .
 
(2) 	Shall not include any other additional or extra payments to
an employee or officer, including overtime, supplementary 
payments, bonuses, lump sum salary supplements, allowances,
or differentials[.]
 
HRS § 88-21.5(b) (emphases added). If, as Petitioners contend,
 
the Legislature intended to include allowances as a form of
 
supplementary payment, it would not have listed the two items
 
separately. The exclusion of "allowances" from HRS § 88-21.5(a)
 
also supports ERS's argument that, had the Legislature intended
 
to include allowances as "compensation," it would have expressly
 
done so.
 
Finally, "[a]lthough not controlling, the uniform
 
practical construction of a statute by those charged with
 
carrying out the statute is entitled to much weight." Chun v.
 
Employees' Ret. Sys., 61 Haw. 596, 602, 607 P.2d 415, 419 (1980). 
See also Treloar v. Swinerton and Walberg Co., 65 Haw. 416, 424,
 
653 P.2d 420, 426 (1982) ("[A]dministrative practice, consistent
 
and generally unchallenged, will not be overturned except for
 
very cogent reasons[.]"). ERS is the agency designated to
 
administer the State's retirement system. HRS § 88-22 (1993). 
Acting in that capacity, ERS's uniform practical construction for
 
decades has been to exclude the car, uniform, and firearm
 
allowances from its definition and calculation of
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"compensation."8 That consistent interpretation has apparently
 
never been formally challenged before Petitioners' claim. 
Furthermore, Petitioners do not dispute that their employers
 
never made contributions to ERS based on the allowances, and the
 
statements of earnings and deductions issued by the employers to
 
Petitioners indicated the allowances were excluded from
 
retirement deductions. Therefore, Petitioners had no reasonable
 
basis to expect retirement benefits based on the allowances. We
 
conclude ERS's uniform construction of "compensation" should not
 
be overturned.
 
Petitioners contend ERS's interpretation and practices
 
are arbitrary because ERS classifies meal allowances and the SOCD
 
(which replaced the uniform and firearm allowances after 1994) as
 
compensation. We agree, however, with ERS's argument that the
 
meal allowances are a component of overtime compensation rather
 
than a reimbursement. Under the collective bargaining
 
agreements, the meal allowances are paid only when an officer
 
works overtime, and the agreements expressly use the term
 
"compensate" to characterize the payments. The SOCD is more
 
difficult to distinguish because it is in effect a replacement of
 
the uniform and firearm allowances. However, ERS has been
 
consistent insofar as it has always included differentials as
 
compensation, and the collective bargaining agreements
 
accordingly characterized the payments as a differential paid for
 
additional services rendered. The agreements noted the SOCD was
 
being provided for the "unique working conditions" which "subject
 
officers to departmental standards of conduct whether on or off
 
8
 The precise number of years is uncertain. During deposition,
ERS's administrator stated ERS's policy of excluding the allowances has never
changed since he joined ERS in 1982.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
duty, 24 hours per day." The agreements also expressly state the
 
SOCD are "paid in the same manner as the employee's regular
 
salary. In contrast, the agreements expressly characterized the
 
uniform and firearm allowances as payments for "maintenance"
 
costs. Thus, the collective bargaining agreements provided ERS
 
with grounds to classify the SOCD as compensation, and ERS's
 
interpretation is not arbitrary.
 
Petitioners also contend the allowances were not
 
reimbursements because Petitioners' employers provided the
 
allowances in fixed amounts regardless of the amount of money the
 
officers spent and did not require the officers to submit
 
receipts or otherwise account for their expenditures. However,
 
we agree with ERS's position that the allowances are in the
 
nature of reimbursements and are not paid in exchange for
 
services. The fixed payments and lack of accounting requirements
 
promote administrative convenience, sparing officers from
 
maintaining records and employers from reviewing and calculating
 
costs. Moreover, the language in the collective bargaining
 
agreements providing for the allowances indicates the allowances'
 
purpose is to help an officer offset whatever purchasing,
 
maintenance, and repair costs he or she is likely to incur. 
Although some officers may not use the full allowance allotment
 
for these purposes, the unused amount bears no relation to the
 
officer's service, but rather is simply a reward for conserving
 
those items. 
Finally, Petitioners emphasize the allowances were
 
taxed as income. However, nothing in the legislative history of
 
HRS § 88-21.5 indicates any legislative intent to adopt or
 
reference federal tax law definitions of compensation.
 
Furthermore, federal tax regulations expressly permit
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
governmental pension plans to exclude items such as
 
reimbursements and allowances from their calculation of
 
retirement benefits, even if such items are gross income under
 
federal income tax laws. 26 C.F.R. § 1.414(s)-1(c)(3) (2007)
 
provides that a pension plan's definition of compensation may be
 
"reduced by all of the following items (even if includible in
 
gross income): reimbursements or other expense allowances, fringe
 
benefits (cash and noncash), moving expenses, deferred
 
compensation, and welfare benefits." Therefore, the taxability
 
of the allowances is not controlling.
 
In sum, given the ambiguity of the statutory language
 
at issue and its subsequent history, the entire statutory scheme,
 
and ERS's long standing interpretation and consistent practice,
 
we conclude ERS's interpretation was not "palpably erroneous" and
 
is entitled to persuasive weight. The circuit court did not err
 
in affirming ERS's decision against Petitioners.
