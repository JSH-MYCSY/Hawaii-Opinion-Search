STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MICHAEL STASZKOW, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-10-03518)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Michael Staszkow (Staszkow) appeals
 
from the Notice and Entry of Judgment and Order (Judgment)
 
entered on December 30, 2011 in the District Court of the Third
 
Circuit, North and South Hilo Division (District Court).1 After
 
a bench trial, the District Court found him guilty of one count
 of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
 
(OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­
1
 The Honorable Harry P. Freitas presided.

61(a) (Supp. 2012),  and sentenced him to pay a $150 fine plus
various fees and take a mandatory driver's education class.
 
On appeal, Staszkow argues the following:
 (1) The District Court clearly erred by finding that
 
"the margin of error allowed for accuracy tests under [Hawaii
 Administrative Rules (HAR)] § 11-114-7(a)(5)[ 
3
] was inapplicable
to the actual breath result that [Staszkow] provided on the date
 of the offense." Staszkow cites primarily to 
State v. Boehmer, 1
 
Haw. App. 44, 613 P.2d 916 (1980), to support this point.
 
(2) The District Court erred when it admitted into 
evidence Officer Andres Fojas's (Officer Fojas) opinion testimony that he determined Staszkow was impaired based on his performance 
on the standardized field sobriety tests (SFSTs). 
Staszkow cites 
to State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i 8, 24, 904 P.2d 893, 909 (1995), 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty;
 
(2) While under the influence of any drug that
impairs the person's ability to operate the vehicle in
a careful and prudent manner;
 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath; or
 
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.
 
3 HAR § 11-114-7(a)(5) provides:
 
(a) Every accuracy test procedure shall be approved by
the DUI coordinator in writing and shall include, but not be
limited to the following requirements:
 
. . . .
 
(5) Reference sample test results which vary from the
target value by more than plus or minus 0.0lgm alcohol /210
liters or plus or minus ten percent, whichever is greater,
shall be cause for the breath alcohol testing instrument
used to be removed from service until the fault has been
 corrected[.]

and State v. Ito, 90 Hawai' i 225, 244, 978 P.2d 191, 210 
(App. 1999), to support this point. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Staszkow's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Any error the District Court committed in finding
 
that the margin of error set forth in HAR § 11-114-7(a)(5) was
 
inapplicable to Staszkow's Intoxilyzer 5000 (Intoxilyzer) test
 
result was harmless. The test result would have been competent
 
evidence of Staszkow's guilt under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), even if
 
the court had applied this margin of error. See HRS §§ 291E-61 &
 
291E-3(b)(2) (Supp. 2012). Boehmer is inapplicable here because
 
no evidence was adduced regarding the Intoxilyzer's margin of
 
error. 1 Haw. App. at 45-46, 613 P.2d at 917-18.
 
(2) The District Court did not abuse its discretion by 
admitting into evidence Officer Fojas's testimony that based on 
Staszkow's performance on the SFSTs, Staszkow was impaired. The 
State laid a sufficient foundation for the introduction of the 
testimony pursuant to Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i at 26, 904 P.2d at 
911. The State was not required to demonstrate that Officer 
Fojas's SFST training met National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration's requirements. Cf. Ito, 90 Hawai' i at 244, 978 
P.2d at 210 (holding that it must be shown that the officer administering the test was "duly qualified to conduct the test 
and grade the test results.") 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice and Entry of
 
Judgment and Order entered on December 30, 2011 in the District
