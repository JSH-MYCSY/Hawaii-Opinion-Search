(4) January 24, 2012 "Order Denying Intervenor-
Plaintiff The Huntington National Bank's Motion to Reconsider the 
Order Granting Defendants The Essential Planning Group, Inc., 
Steve Buss and Margaret Bowen's Motion to Dismiss Comerica Bank & 
Trust, N.A.'s Intervenor Complaint Treated as a Motion for 
Summary Judgment under Rule 56, File November 17, 2011, and State 
of Hawaif i's Joinder" all entered in the Circuit Court of the 
1
First Circuit  (circuit court).  
This appeal is part of a larger dispute involving
 
multiple parties involved with the RightStar trusts. 
The primary
 
parties in this appeal are Huntington for the Amended RightStar
 
Resolution Agreement (ARRA) Pooled Claims Representation, and
 
Defendants-Appellees The Essential Planning Group, Inc., dba
 
American Funeral & Cemetery Trust Services, Hal Martin, Steve
 
Buss and Margaret Bowen (collectively, AFCTS).
 
On appeal Huntington contends the circuit court erred
 
when it:
 
(1) converted AFCTS's motion to dismiss into a motion
 
for summary judgment and failed to give the parties prior notice
 
and opportunity to present all pertinent evidence;
 
(2) granted AFCTS's motion to dismiss, which the court
 
converted into a motion for summary judgment, and entered a final
 
judgment in favor of AFCTS dismissing the Intervenor Complaint;
 
and
 
(3) denied Huntington's motion for reconsideration.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In 2001, RightStar International (RightStar) created a
 
trust to provide pre-need funeral and cemetery services and
 designated AFCTS as RightStar's agent to manage the pre-need
 
service trust funds. RightStar and AFCTS amended the agreement
 
in July 2001, naming AFCTS as agent to administer perpetual care
 
funds and pre-need trusts for each RightStar entity. AFCTS
 
continued to serve in this capacity for RightStar and the

2
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subsequent receiver from 2001 through 2004. RightStar allegedly
 
misused pre-need trust funds from 2002 through 2004.
 
This is an appeal from consolidated cases known
 
collectively as In re RightStar Related Cases. The circuit
 
court2 consolidated the following fourteen cases in this matter:
 
04-1-2112 Bennett v. Hawaii Cemetery
 
04-1-2126 Vestin v. RightStar AMG
 05-1-0712 IFC v. HIP
 06-1-0383 ADP v. Dooley
 06-1-0384 Vestin v. Derizo
 06-1-0385 Vestin v. Chang
 06-1-0386 Vestin v. Edgecore
 06-1-0387 Vestin v. di Mauro-Pender
 06-1-0388 Vestin v. Newby
 06-1-0389 Vestin v. Haffner
 06-1-0390 Vestin v. Moses
 06-1-0391 Vestin v. American Media
 06-1-0392 Vestin v. IFC
 06-1-0679 Vestin v. State of Hawaii
 
Litigation began with Bennett v. Hawaii Cemetery and Funeral 
Trusts, et al., Civil No. 04-1-2112, an action brought by the 
State of Hawaif i (State) as parens patriae in 2004, and continued 
with various actions including a third party action brought by 
Vestin Mortgage, Inc. (Vestin), Vestin Mortgage, Inc., v. State 
of Hawaif i, et al., Civil No. 06-1-0679. 
In 2004, Comerica Bank & Trust, N.A. (Comerica) became
 
successor trustee for the RightStar trusts. In May 2007, the
 
State, Vestin, and Comerica executed the RightStar Resolution
 
Agreement (RRA) and agreed to terminate claims against each other
 
while pursuing recovery from RightStar defendants. In 2009, the
 
State, Vestin, and Comerica amended the RRA. In the Amended
 
RightStar Resolution Agreement (ARRA), the parties agreed to stay
 
RightStar litigation for six years and pursue pooled claims
 
against former trustees and third parties. The ARRA created a

3
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claim sharing agreement whereby a "Recovery Team" would pursue
 
claims on behalf of the State, Vestin, and Comerica. 
On September 8, 2010 Comerica filed a "Motion to
 
Intervene And To File Intervenor Complaint" in the Bennett and
 
2006 Vestin actions as the successor trustee for the ARRA
 
3
Recovery Team. The circuit court  granted Comerica's motion to
intervene on February 15, 2011. On February 16, 2011,
 
Intervenor-Plaintiff Comerica as Successor Trustee filed an
 
Intervenor Complaint against Defendants-Appellees John F. Dooley;
 
Richard Bricka; Kathy Hoover; Charles C. Cashner; Douglas G.
 
Draper; Steven C. Dugan; Bruce Dooley; Stephen E. Harris; M.
 
Tyler Pottenger; Reed B. Rohrer; John D. Waihee; Verner,
 
Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand; Cantella & Co., Inc.;
 
Lance Newby; John Turner; American Funeral & Cemetary Trust
 
Services; Hal Martin; Steve Buss; Margaret Bowen; Estate
 
Admististrative Services, Inc.; The Mortgage Group; James A.
 
Wager; Wagner Choi and Verbrugge; and John Does 1-10. 
On March 10, 2011, the State and Comerica filed a joint 
motion to replace Comerica as trustee and real party in interest. 
AFCTS filed a motion to dismiss the Intervenor Complaint on March 
31, 2011. 
On April 25, 2011, Comerica and the State filed a 
"Notice of Designation of Huntington National Bank as Chapter 441 Replacement Trustee Under Joint Motion of State of Hawaif i and 
Comerica Bank & Trust, N.A. As Trustee" naming Huntington as trustee for the "RightStar Trusts" and the "Recovery Trust" 
established by the ARRA. This notice also named Huntington the 
nominal plaintiff to pursue claims for the ARRA Recovery Team. 
On May 31, 2011, the circuit court entered an order granting the 
motion to name Huntington as the replacement trustee, but denying 
the motion to name Huntington as the real party in interest. 
Comerica and the State filed a motion for
 
reconsideration and/or clarification and the circuit court named
 
Huntington co-plaintiff with Comerica on the Intervenor

Complaint. The circuit court clarified Huntington's position as
 
trustee of the "Trust Recovery Mechanism", giving them authority
 
to pursue claims as the plaintiff for the ARRA Recovery Team.
 
The circuit court heard AFCTS's motion to dismiss on
 
June 23, 2011 and again on July 12, 2011. The circuit court
 
converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary
 
judgment and granted the motion. Huntington filed a motion for
 
reconsideration on November 11, 2011. On January 24, 2012, the
 
circuit court entered an order denying Huntington's motion for
 
reconsideration filed November 17, 2011. Huntington filed a
 
notice of appeal on January 27, 2012.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant
 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107
 
Hawaifi 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. 
Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawaif i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). 
The Hawaif i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Querubin, 107 Hawaif i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawaif i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71). 
Rule 56. Summary judgment.
. . . .
 
(e) Form of affidavits; further testimony; defense
 
required. . . . When a motion for summary judgment is made
. . . , an adverse party may not rest upon the mere
allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise
provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing
that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse
 party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate,
shall be entered against the adverse party.
 
Thus, "[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment cannot
 
discharge his or her burden by alleging conclusions, 'nor is [the
 
party] entitled to a trial on the basis of a hope that [the
 
party] can produce some evidence at that time.'" Henderson v.
 
Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387, 401, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991)
 (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay
 
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2727 (1983)).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Huntington contends the circuit court erred in its
 
decision to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for
 
summary judgment inasmuch as: (1) the materials submitted by both
 
AFCTS and Huntington were not materials outside the pleadings,
 
and (2) the circuit court denied Huntington notice and
 
opportunity by denying any leave to submit affidavits. 
Huntington asserts that the exhibits submitted by both
 
parties were alleged in the pleadings and, thus, not outside the
 
pleadings. AFTCS submitted the memorandum in support of the
 
motion to dismiss with three exhibits: an email sent from the
 
Deputy Attorney General to the counsel for AFTCS; a copy of the
 
2003 RightStar Agreement with AFTCS; and a declaration from the
 
President and Chief Financial Officer of AFCTS, Craig Martin. 
Huntington then submitted a memorandum in opposition with ten
 
attached exhibits: the 2001 RightStar agreement with AFTCS, the
 
July 2001 agreement between RightStar and AFCTS, three sealed
 
exhibits, the December 8, 2004 Order Granting Appointment of
 
Receiver Pendente Lite, the May 2007 agreement between RightStar
 
and AFCTS, the 2009 agreement between RightStar and AFCTS, and
 
Combs v. Bigelow & Lombardi, No. 28773, 2010 Haw. App. LEXIS 25
 
(Jan. 27, 2010). At the June 23, 2011 hearing on the motion to
 
dismiss, the parties referred the court to the attached exhibits
 
during arguments on the motion. At the July 12, 2011 hearing the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for
 
summary judgment in light of the exhibits submitted to the
 
circuit court for consideration.
 
Hawaifi law is well settled that when a party presents 
a motion to dismiss and refers the court to materials outside the 
pleadings, the court may convert the action into a motion for 
summary judgment.4 Wong v. Cayetano, 111 Hawaif i 462, 476, 143 
P.3d 1, 15 (2006). 
The circuit court did not err in concluding that the
 
exhibits and documents submitted by both parties required the
 circuit court to treat the motion as a motion for summary
 
judgment. 
Huntington contends that even if the circuit court did 
not err in converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for 
summary judgment, the circuit court erred by failing to give 
Huntington proper notice or opportunity to present materials. 
Huntington claims the circuit court decision to convert the 
motion unduly prejudiced Huntington by denying any opportunity to 
present materials in support of their position. Huntington did 
not, however, state what materials it could present or what 
discovery may have been required, to oppose the motion for 
summary judgment as to the statute of limitations. As such, this 
case is distinguishable from Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawaif i 46, 292 
P.3d 1276 (2013). 
HRCP Rule 12(c) provides that once a motion on the
 
pleadings has been converted into a motion for summary judgment,
 "all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all
 
material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56." HRCP Rule
 
12(c). Notice and opportunity can be accomplished through the
 
party's recognition that the opposing party relied on materials
 
4
 Hawaifi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(c) provides in
part, "[i]f, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the
pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall betreated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56[.]"HRCP Rule 12(c). 
7

outside the pleadings in the motion. Gonsalves v. First Ins.
 
Co., 55 Haw. 155, 161, 516 P.2d 720, 724 (1973). 
Huntington presented ten exhibits for the circuit
 
court's consideration. Huntington cannot claim to be surprised
 
by the circuit court's decision to convert the motion when it
 
submitted outside materials with its memorandum in opposition. 
During the June 23, 2011 hearing both the movant and Huntington
 
referred the circuit court to attached exhibits during arguments
 
on the motion. The circuit court did not deprive Huntington of
 
notice or opportunity when Huntington's own actions should have
 
put it on notice. 
Huntington asserted three claims against AFCTS:
 
negligence, intentional interference with contract, and aiding
 
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. All claims against AFCTS
 
arose from the alleged misuse of trust funds that occurred from
 
2001 until 2004. AFCTS contended Huntington's claims were
 
outside the statute of limitations and did not relate back to the
 
original complaints. Though Huntington intervened into ongoing
 
litigation, neither Bennett nor Vestin named AFCTS as a party. 
Huntington's intervenor complaint added AFCTS as a party to the
 
RightStar litigation. 
Huntington contends the applicable statute of
 
limitations is Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-1 (1993
 
Repl.), which provides that actions "shall be commenced within
 
six years next after the cause of action accrued[.]" Even if HRS
 
§ 657-1 applied, the claims against AFCTS accrued by 2004 and
 
Huntington did not file the Intervenor Complaint until February
 
2011, seven years after the accrual of claims against AFCTS.
 
Huntington contends its claims relate back to the 
Bennett and Vestin actions. Relation back allows for a 
subsequent pleading that arises from the same transaction or 
occurrence to "relate back" to an earlier pleading, thus 
preserving the statute of limitations for that subsequent 
pleading. See, e.g., HRCP Rule 15(c); See also, Fujimoto v. Au, 
95 Hawaif i 116, 142, 19 P.3d 699, 725 (2001) (applying relation 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
back to HRCP Rule 17(a)). Under the theory of "relation back,"
 
courts can allow for amended pleadings to add or substitute
 
parties to litigation and to present additional claims. Kest v.
 
Hana Ranch, Inc., 7 Haw. App. 565, 570, 785 P.2d 1325, 1329
 (1990) (citing Meredith v. United Air Lines, 41 F.R.D. 34, 39
 
(S.D. Cal. 1966); Gridley v. Sayre & Fisher Co., 409 F.Supp. 1266
 
(D.S.D. 1976)). The original pleadings must put the defendant on 
notice of the claims and parties that may arise for the 
subsequent pleading to relate back without subjecting the 
defendant to undue prejudice. Id. (citing 6 C. Wright & A. 
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1497 (1971)). To 
avoid abuse or prejudice, courts "[restrict] relation back to 
situations involving honest or understandable mistakes to prevent 
plaintiffs from using the rule to join or substitute persons 
whose interests were not contemplated from the beginning of the 
suit." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawaif i 116, 143, 19 P.3d 699, 726 
(2001) (citing Rinke v. Johns-Manville Corp., 47 Wash. App. 222, 230, 734 P.2d 533, 538 (1987)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
In this case, the original pleadings did not provide
 
AFCTS with adequate notice. Neither Bennett nor Vestin named
 
AFCTS as a defendant. The original pleadings provided no notice
 
to AFCTS of the claims subsequently brought against them. As
 
such, Huntington may not use relation back to bring claims
 
against AFCTS beyond the statute of limitations since AFCTS would
 
suffer unfair prejudice.
 
Huntington contends the statute of limitations
 
equitably tolled while Huntington awaited authority to pursue
 
claims on behalf of the ARRA.
 
Equitable tolling allows claims to be asserted beyond 
the expiration of the statute of limitations when the claimant 
has diligently pursued its rights, and "extraordinary 
circumstance" prevented filing within the statute of limitations. 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 Hawaif i 338, 360, 133 
P.3d 767, 789 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
9
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Huntington's assertion of equitable tolling fails because no
 
party to the RightStar litigation pursued claims against AFCTS
 
and Huntington points to no extraordinary circumstance preventing
 
filing within the statute of limitations.
 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err in granting
 
summary judgment where the statute of limitations bars
 
Huntington's claims against AFCTS. 
Huntington presented no argument to support a review of 
the motion for reconsideration. Therefore, this point is waived 
under Hawaif i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7).
