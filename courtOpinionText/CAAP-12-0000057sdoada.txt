Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 56(f) request for a continuance, and (2)
 
erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee
 U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for Citigroup Mortgage
 Loan Trust 2006-WFHE4 ("U.S. Bank") because (a) "the moving
 papers were deficient as a matter of law" and failed to meet U.S.
 Bank's burden of proof; (b) U.S. Bank did not disprove every
 affirmative defense against it; (c) there were genuine issues of
 fact as to the validity of the foreclosure and the standing of
 the moving party; and (d) Long was denied due process.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Long's points as follows and affirm:
 
(1) Long argues that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion in denying his request for a continuance under HRCP Rule 56(f). We disagree. See U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai
'i 28, 39, 313 P.3d 717, 728 (2013) (concluding that the 
trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying HRCP Rule 56(f) request because appellant failed to show how the proposed discovery would demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact). See also Wilder v. Tanouye, 7 Haw. App. 247, 253-54, 753 P.2d 816, 821 (1988) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying HRCP Rule 56(f) request, when requesting party failed to provide any reason for not conducting adequate discovery during twenty-nine month period since the filing of the original complaint); Briggs v. Wilcox, 991 N.E.2d 262, 263, 271 (Ohio Ct. App. 2013) (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying substantially similar Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(f) motion by substitute counsel, when issue had been raised in pleadings and was pending for over a year, yet discovery was not sought until motion for summary judgment).

 The argument section of Long's opening brief does not contain any
citations to the record. Long also declines to provide any page cites to the
cases discussed in the argument. Accordingly, Long fails to comply with theHawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure and his arguments may be deemed waived.
See Haw. R. App. P. Rule 28(b)(7). However, as "the policies of this courtare to permit litigants to appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits,
where possible[,]" O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885
P.2d 361, 364 (1994), we address the merits of Long's appeal, to the extent we
can discern them.

(2) Long contends that U.S. Bank's moving papers were 
deficient, because "the declarations submitted in support of the 
motion [for summary judgment were] defective as a matter of law and did not show affirmatively that the declarants/affiants were competent to testify, did not set forth admissible evidence based on personal knowledge, and otherwise violated rules of professional conduct." The documentary evidence of Long signing the note and mortgage, coupled with the declaration of indebtedness, record of delinquent payments, and the assignment, however, was "clearly sufficient" to satisfy U.S. Bank's initial burden of production. See Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB v. Russell, 99 
Hawai
'i 173, 184, 53 P.3d 312, 323 (App. 2002). See also Castro, 
131 Hawai 'i at 41, 313 P.3d at 730 (counsel's declaration was not 
deficient as a matter of law as it included self-authenticating documents along with other documents establishing a direct chain of title). 
Relying on GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 79 Hawai
'i 
516, 904 P.2d 530 (App. 1995) ("Jaffarian I"), Long further argues that U.S. Bank was required to "disprove every affirmative defense asserted against it in this case" and that there were genuine issues of fact as to the validity of the foreclosure and U.S. Bank's standing. 
Long's reliance on Jaffarian I is misplaced. GECC Fin. 
Corp. v. Jaffarian, 80 Hawai
'i 118, 119, 905 P.2d 624, 625 (1995) 
("a plaintiff-movant is not required to disprove affirmative defenses asserted by a defendant in order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment"). A plaintiff-movant "is only obligated to disprove an affirmative defense on a motion for summary judgment when 'the defense produces material in support of an affirmative defense.'" Castro, 131 Hawai
'i at 41, 313 P.3d at 730 (quoting 
Jaffarian I, 79 Hawai 'i at 526, 904 P.2d at 540 (Acoba, J., 
concurring) (footnote omitted)). Here, Long's declaration merely speculated that discovery would result in a certain outcome and did not provide sufficient evidence of Long's interest in or ownership of the Note and Mortgage. Therefore, the declaration did not demonstrate the existence of genuine issues of material fact as to whether U.S. Bank was a real party in interest, and

Long, as defendant, did not meet his burden of proving facts
 
essential to his defense. See id. at 41-42, 313 P.3d at 730-31.
 
Finally, as to Long's claim that he was denied due
 
process, Long failed to include transcripts of the Circuit Court
 proceedings, including the November 1, 2011 hearing on the motion
 for summary judgment, in the record on appeal. Thus, the record
 on appeal is "factually undeveloped with respect to the due
 process claim." Id. at 42, 313 P.3d at 731. Furthermore, the
 
record indicates, and Long does not dispute, that he received
 written notice of and personally attended the November 1, 2011
 hearing on the motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the
 record does not indicate that Long was denied "notice and an
 opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful
 manner[,]" Id. at 42, 313 P.3d at 731, and the Circuit Court did
 not err in granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Bank.
 
Therefore,
 The December 28, 2011 Judgment on Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Second Motion
 for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
 Defendants on Complaint Filed May 13, 2009, Filed September 2,
 2011 is affirmed.
