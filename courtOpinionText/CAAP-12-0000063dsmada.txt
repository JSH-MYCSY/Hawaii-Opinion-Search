IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
PAUL PERRONE, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GENBAO GAO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1154)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL NO. CAAP-12-0000063
 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Defendant/Counterlaim-Plaintiff/Appellant 
Genbao Gao's (Appellant Gao) appeal from the Honorable Rom A. Trader's January 3, 2012 judgment, because the January 3, 2012 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments,
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in
 
the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate
 document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under
 HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced
 to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and
 against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) 
must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "[A]n appeal from 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties 
or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although the parties asserted multiple claims through
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Paul Perrone's
 (Appellee Perrone) complaint and Appellant Gao's counterclaim,
 the January 3, 2012 judgment enters judgment only as to Appellee
 Perrone's claim of defamation. The January 3, 2012 judgment, on
 its face, neither resolves Appellant Gao's counterclaim nor
 contains an express finding of no just reason for delay in the
 entry of judgment on one or more but less than all claims
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the January 3, 2012
 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in
 Jenkins. Absent an appealable judgment, the appeal in Appeal No. 
CAAP-12-0000063 is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000063. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000063 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
