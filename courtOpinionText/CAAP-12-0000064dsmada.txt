APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-1981-11)
 
ORDER GRANTING JULY 12, 2012 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL NO. CAAP-12-0000064 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Appellee/Cross-Appellee 
Coastal Construction Co., Inc.'s (Appellee Coastal Construction), 
July 12, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000064 for lack of jurisdiction, (2) the failure of any party to file a memorandum in opposition to Appellee Coastal Construction's July 12, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000064 for lack of jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000064 because the Honorable Rom A. Trader's January 9, 2012 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), 
Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the 
holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have 
been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if
 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims
 against all parties or contain the finding necessary for
 certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added).
 
Although the parties have asserted numerous causes of
 
action, including those asserted in the second amended complaint,
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the third-party complaint, the counterclaim, the fourth-party
 
complaint, and numerous cross-claims, the January 9, 2012
 judgment does not always specifically identify the claim or
 claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment. For
 example, on page three of the January 9, 2012 judgment, the
 circuit court enters judgment by merely referring to the titles
 of interlocutory orders instead of specifically identifying the
 claim or claims that the circuit court intends to resolve:
 
Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Fourth-Party
Defendant PACIFIC FENCE and against Plaintiffs pursuant to
the "Order Granting Fourth-Party Defendant Pacific Fence,
Inc.'s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed on May 6,
2010" filed on September 16, 2010.
 
Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Third-Party
Defendant/Fourth-Party Plaintiff KIEWIT and against
Plaintiffs pursuant to the "Order Granting Third-Party
Defendant and Fourth-Party Plaintiff Kiewit Pacific Co.'s
Motion for Summary Judgment filed Herein on May 17, 2010"
filed on October 18, 2010.
 
The above-quoted language does not specifically identify the
 
claim or claims that the circuit court intends to resolve. 
Similarly, page six of the January 9, 2012 judgment purports to
 enter judgment in favor of and against certain parties pursuant
 to interlocutory orders, but the language on page six of the
 January 9, 2012 judgment does not specifically identify the claim
 or claims that the circuit court intends to resolve. Pages seven
 through nine of the January 9, 2012 judgment purport to enter
 judgment on numerous interlocutory orders without identifying the
 claim or claims that the circuit court intends to resolve. The
 judgment document should enter judgment only on specifically
 identified substantive claims and the relief, if any, that the
 circuit court intends to award; the judgment document should not
 enter judgment on interlocutory orders that do not resolve
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims. In fact, an appealable final judgment does not need to 
refer to any interlocutory orders to ensure appellate review of the interlocutory orders, because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawai' i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 
902 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Because the January 9, 2012 judgment does not specifically identify each and every claim on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, the January 9, 2012 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, the appeal and cross-appeals in Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000064 are premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000064. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Coastal
 
Construction's July 12, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP­12-0000064 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and the appeal
 and cross-appeals in Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000064 are dismissed for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction.
