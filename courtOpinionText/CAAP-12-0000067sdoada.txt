STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GABRIEL L. PIEPER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1P111-02243)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Gabriel L. Pieper (Pieper) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on
 
January 11, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
1
Honolulu Division (District Court).  Pieper was found guilty of
 
Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 707-712(1)(a) (1993).
 
On appeal, Pieper contends he was deprived of his right
 
to due process by an unduly suggestive pretrial identification.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Pieper's point of error as follows:
 
Pieper failed to object to any pretrial identification
 
by a percipient witness to the incident. 
In support of his
 
assertion that he objected to the pretrial identification by the
 witness, Pieper points to one remark in his closing argument:

And one witness says that the attackers were shorter
than her, she was six-one and she said they were
shorter than her, the other witness says he’s six-
three and the attackers were taller than him, you
know. So their testimony at the bar is not all that
great. What they’re doing is identifying people who
were present at the lineup. And, you know, kind of
suggestive. 
(Emphasis added).
 
Counsel's comment during Pieper's closing argument does 
not constitute an objection to any witness pretrial 
identification. Even if the remark were considered an objection, the objection was made during closing argument, well after the witness had finished her testimony. "Except as otherwise provided by the rules of court, there shall be no reversal for any alleged error in the admission or rejection of evidence or the giving of or refusing to give an instruction to the jury unless such alleged error was made the subject of an objection noted at the time it was committed or brought to the attention of the court in another appropriate manner." HRS § 641-16 (1993); State v. Mathias, 57 Haw. 96, 101, 550 P.2d 900, 903-04 (1976); Lee v. Elbaum, 77 Hawai' i 446, 452-53, 887 P.2d 656, 662-63 (App. 
1993) (point of error waived when no objection to foundation raised until after close of evidence and just prior to settling of jury instructions). Therefore, the point of error is waived. 
To the extent that Pieper argues that there was 
insufficient evidence to convict him because the suggestiveness of the initial identification caused the witnesses' testimony to be unreliable, and therefore, not credible, we reject this argument. "An appellate court will not pass upon the trial judge's decisions with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence because this is the province of the trial judge." Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai' i 42, 60, 169 P.3d 
994, 1012 (App. 2007) (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 
139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996)). In addition, the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court has

long held that evidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when
the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such
evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies
whether the case was before a judge or a jury. The test on
 appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a
reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence
to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. Indeed,
even if it could be said in a bench trial that the
 conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as
there is substantial evidence to support the requisite
findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material
element of the offense charged is credible evidence
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion. And as trier of fact, the trial judge is
free to make all reasonable and rational inferences
 under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial
evidence.
 
State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931
 
(1992).
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). Upon review, we conclude there was substantial evidence
 
in the record to support Pieper's conviction.
 
For these reasons, the District Court's January 11,
 
2012 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order is affirmed.
