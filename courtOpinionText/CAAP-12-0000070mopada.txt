MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
I.
 
Defendants-Appellants Ke Kailani Development, LLC,
 
(KKD) and Michael J. Fuchs (Fuchs) (collectively the "Borrowers")

 
appeal from several orders and judgments entered by the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 Borrowers' appeal
 
arises out of a failed commercial real estate development on the
 Island of Hawai
'i and the subsequent foreclosure proceedings.

Between 2005 and 2007, KKD and Ke Kailani Corporation
 
(KKC) entered into and modified an Infrastructure Loan Agreement
 
(Infrastructure Loan) with the Bank of Hawaii, Central Pacific
 Bank, and Finance Factors, Limited (collectively the "Banks"),
 whereby the Banks agreed to loan, and KKD and KKC agreed to
 borrow, moneys for the purpose of financing the development of a
 certain 65.526 acres of land located in the District of South
 Kohala, County of Hawai
'i (Project). KKD and KKC executed a 
promissory note (Infrastructure Note) in favor of the Banks and
 secured the note with a mortgage on the Project property.
 
Fuchs executed and delivered to the Banks a Guaranty
 
and Indemnification (Infrastructure Guaranty), in which Fuchs
 guaranteed full payment and performance of all obligations

 These facts are largely taken from the Circuit Court's
September 1, 2010 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting
[Banks'] Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Filed April 22,2010" (Decree of Foreclosure). As Borrowers have not challenged the Decree ofForeclosure or these findings of fact, we are bound by them. Okada Trucking
Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defined therein, including but not limited to, payment of all
 
sums due under the Infrastructure Note.
 
Between 2006 and 2007, the Banks, KKD, and KKC also
 
entered into and modified a Loan Agreement (Villas Loan
 Agreement) for the purpose of further development of a certain
 8.14 acres of land in South Kohala, Hawai
'i (Villa Property). 
KKD and KKC executed and delivered a promissory note (Villas Note) and a mortgage securing the note to the Banks. Fuchs also personally guaranteed this loan. 
On or about October 1, 2009, the Banks sent a letter to

 
Borrowers, notifying them that the amended Infrastructure Note
 and the Villas Note each had matured on July 20, 2009, and that
 the failure of Borrowers to repay those notes constituted
 default. The Banks demanded immediate payment of the entire
 unpaid amounts due thereunder.
 
As of October 1, 2009, KKD and Fuchs, as guarantor,
 
jointly and severally, owed the Banks (1) the principal amount of
 $14,128,422.76 under the amended Infrastructure Note plus accrued
 and unpaid interest, late charges, advances, expenses, and
 attorneys' fees incurred and to be incurred by the Banks, in
 connection with the collection of the amounts due and unpaid
 under the Infrastructure Loan Documents, and (2) the principal
 amount of $8,099,303.75 under the Villas Note plus accrued and
 unpaid interest, late charges, advances, expenses, and attorneys'
 fees incurred and to be incurred by the Banks in connection with
 the collection of the amounts due and unpaid under the Villas
 Loan Documents.
 
At some unspecified point, KKC was dissolved.
 On October 27, 2009, the Banks initiated the instant
 
foreclosure action pursuant to defaults on the Infrastructure
 Loan and Villas Loan which was assigned Civ. No. 09-1-2523-10.
 
On December 23, 2009, Borrowers filed counter-claims
 
for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of good faith and fair
 dealing; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) interference with
 advantageous economic relations; (5) unfair and deceptive banking
 practices; (6) fraud and deceit; (7) rescission; (8) dissolution
 of partnership; (9) discharge of guaranties; (10) declaratory and
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
injunctive relief; (11) abuse of process; (12) wrongful
 
foreclosure; and (13) punitive damages.
 
On April 22, 2010, the Banks moved for summary judgment
 
and decree of foreclosure as well as summary judgment on
 Borrowers' counterclaims. On September 1, 2010, the Circuit
 Court entered its Foreclosure Order finding that, as of that
 date, Borrowers owed the Banks a total of $26,114,860.79, with an
 additional per diem interest of $9,261.55272 to the date of
 payment of the indebtedness and also concluded that the Banks
 were entitled to a deficiency judgment against Fuchs,
 individually, for the difference between the amount owed to the
 Banks under the Infrastructure Loan Documents and the Villas Loan
 Documents and the foreclosure sale proceeds applied thereto, and
 entered summary judgment in the Banks' favor on the Borrowers'
 counterclaims.
 
On December 6, 2010, the Banks filed Plaintiffs' Motion
 
for Substitution of Parties. The Banks requested that the
 Circuit Court substitute KKP in place of the Banks. The Banks
 asserted that on or about November 30, 2010, the Banks sold all
 of their interests in the Infrastructure Loan and Villas Loan and
 associated documents to Hawaii Renaissance Builders, LLC (HRB). 
The Banks further asserted that on or about December 1, 2010, HRB
 transferred all of those interests to KKP. The Circuit Court
 granted the substitution on December 30, 2010 without opposition
 by Borrowers.
4
 
4 On December 30, 2010, Borrowers filed a notice of appeal from the
Foreclosure Order, Counterclaim Order and respective judgments, which was
assigned appellate case number CAAP-11-0000009. Borrowers did not challenge
the Order Granting Substitution.
 
On January 5, 2011, KKD filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
protection. On March 1, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawaii
entered its "Order Regarding Secured Creditor [KKP's] Motion for Relief From
Stay" (Bankruptcy Order). The Bankruptcy Order required as a condition of
lifting the stay that, inter alia, Borrowers would dismiss with prejudice the
appeal filed December 30, 2010. The Bankruptcy Order further required that
Borrowers not appeal any order, finding, conclusion, judgment, or other
decision in Civil No. 09-1-2523-10 entered or rendered prior to the date of
the Bankruptcy Order.
 
On March 18, 2011, Borrowers and KKP, "substituted as
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants in this matter, in place of" the Banks, as
well as others, filed a Stipulation to Dismiss Appeal in CAAP-11-0000009.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 21, 2011, an auction of the Infrastructure
Property and Villas Property was held. KKP was the sole bidder
 
and submitted a credit bid of $10,000,000.00.
 
 
On July 8, 2011, KKP moved for confirmation of the
 
foreclosure sale, which was opposed by Borrowers on July 27,
 2011. Borrowers alleged that KKP had no standing to foreclose or
 continue with confirmation of the sale because (1) the Banks'
 assignments to HRB and KKP were unlawful and void; and (2) HRB's
 transfer to KKP was unlawful and void. Borrowers' allegation was
 "based upon the facts set forth in the attached Complaint filed
 today in Civil No. 11-1-1577-07 BIA[.]"
5
 
On August 1, 2011, KKP replied to Borrowers' July 27,
 
2011 memorandum in opposition. KKP asserted that (1) it did have
 standing; and (2) Borrowers waived any objection (a) by failing
 to object to the December 6, 2010 Plaintiffs' Motion for
 Substitution of Parties, and (b) by stipulating to the March 1,
 2011 Bankruptcy Order requiring them not to object to any
 decision in Civil No. 09-1-2523-10 entered or rendered prior to
 the date of the March 1, 2011 Bankruptcy Order.
 
On August 4, 2011, Borrowers filed a motion to
 
consolidate Civil No. 09-1-2523-10 and Civil No. 11-1-1577-07.
 
On October 3, 2011, the Circuit Court entered its (1)
 
Order Confirming Sale; (2) judgment; and (3) writ of possession.
 
4(...continued)
This court approved the Stipulation to Dismiss Appeal and CAAP-11-0000009 was
dismissed with prejudice on March 24, 2011.
 
5 On July 27, 2011, Borrowers filed a Complaint in Civil No.
11-1-1577-07 against KKP, HRB, the Banks, and George Van Buren, the
commissioner appointed to conduct the foreclosure sale. Those defendants
 moved to dismiss Borrowers' July 27, 2011 Complaint on September 6, 2011.
While that motion was still pending, on November 4, 2011, Borrowers filed an
Amended Complaint with an additional party, the law firm of Bays Deaver Lung
Rose & Holma (Bays).
 
The Amended Complaint purports to assert the following twelve
counts: (1) breach of contract; (2) "business compulsion"; (3) "tortious
interference"; (4) "wrongful contract repudiation"; (5) breach of services
contract; (6) misrepresentation; (7) legal malpractice; (8) "indemnification";(9) specific performance; (10) a prayer for reformation of contracts;
(11) "rescission of escrow cancellation"; and (12) "rescission of sale
agreements."
 

For these facts we take judicial notice of the files and records

in Civil No. 11-1-1577-07 BIA. Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 201.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On October 14, 2011, Borrowers filed a motion for post-
judgment relief from the October 3, 2011 Order Confirming Sale. 
Borrowers requested "(1) reconsideration of the Order under Rule 59(e) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure [HRCP]; (2) to 
vacate the Order under HRCP Rule 60(b)(2) based on newly discovered evidence; and (3) to stay the Order under HRCP Rule 62(h) until the final disposition of a separate related action[, Civil No. 11-1-1577-07.]" 
On November 4, 2011, Borrowers' counsel sent a letter
 
to presiding Judge Bert I. Ayabe. The letter cited alleged
 conflicts of interest and requested that Judge Ayabe recuse
 himself. The alleged conflict of interest arose because
 Borrowers named Bays as an additional defendant in Civil No. 11­1-1577-07.
 
On November 7, 2011, Borrowers filed a Request for
 
Judicial Notice of the November 4, 2011 letter and Borrowers'
 First Amended Complaint in Civil No. 11-1-1577-07.
 
On November 15, 2011, KKP filed a Motion for
 
Determination of Deficiency Amount. Three days later, Borrowers
 moved to continue KKP's motion until there was a final judgment
 in Civil No. 11-1-1577-07. Borrowers filed their opposition to
 this motion on November 28, 2011.
 
On November 25, 2011, Borrowers filed a Motion to
 
Disqualify the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe from all Proceedings in
 Civil No. 09-1-2523-10. The Circuit Court orally denied the
 motion after a hearing held on December 20, 2011 and followed
 with a written order entered on January 27, 2012.
 
On December 19, 2011, the Circuit Court entered its
 
order denying Borrowers' August 4, 2011 motion to consolidate.
 
On January 5, 2012, the Circuit Court entered its order
 
denying Borrowers' October 14, 2011 motion for post-judgment
 relief.
 
On February 3, 2012, the Borrowers filed a Notice of
 
Appeal from: (1) the Order Confirming Sale; (2) the October 3,
 2011 Judgment; (3) the October 3, 2011 Writ of Possession;
 (4) the December 19, 2011 order denying Borrowers' August 4, 2011
 motion to consolidate; and (5) the January 5, 2012 order denying
 
7
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Borrowers' October 14, 2011 motion for post-judgment relief. 
This appeal was given appellate case number CAAP-12-0000070.
 
On April 23, 2012, the Circuit Court entered its
 
(1) order granting KKP's November 15, 2011 Motion for
 Determination of Deficiency Amount; and (2) Judgment.
 
On April 24, 2012, Borrowers filed a Notice of
 
Supplemental Objections to the form of KKP's proposed Order on
 KKP's Motion for Determination of Deficiency Amount and proposed
 Judgment thereon.
6
 
On May 3, 2012, Borrowers moved for reconsideration and
 
rehearing based upon alleged manifest error and admissions
 against interest.
7 The request was based upon three claimed
 
errors by the Circuit Court: (1) the failure to adequately
 explain the deficiency judgment; (2) the failure to consolidate
 Civil No. 09-1-2523-10 and Civil No. 11-1-1577-07; and (3) the
 violation of due process when it determined the deficiency
 amount.
 
On May 11, 2012, Borrowers' counsel again sent a letter
 
to the Circuit Court urging Judge Ayabe to recuse himself.
 Borrowers' counsel alleged that Judge Ayabe had a conflict of
 interest based upon alleged ownership of Bank of Hawaii stock
 valued between $25,000 and $50,000.
 
On May 17, 2012, the May 11, 2012 letter was filed with
 
the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court convened a status
 conference during which Judge Ayabe explained that the Bank of
 Hawaii stock at issue was held in a custodial UTMA account for
 the benefit of his adult daughter. Judge Ayabe concluded that
 the Bank of Hawaii stock did not violate Hawaii disqualification
 statutes and orally indicated that any motion to disqualify would
 be denied.
 
On June 12, 2012, Borrowers filed a second motion to
 
disqualify Judge Ayabe from all proceedings in Civil No.
 
6
 These objections appear to constitute a memorandum in opposition
to the November 15, 2011 Motion for Determination of Deficiency Amount, which
was granted the day before. 
7
 Apparently there was no written order denying the May 3, 2012
motion for reconsideration and rehearing.

09-1-2523-10 and to set aside all orders and judgments entered by
 
Judge Ayabe, which was denied by order entered July 30, 2012.
 
On August 31, 2012, Borrowers filed a Notice of Appeal
 
from: (1) the April 23, 2012 order granting KKP's November 15,
 2011 Motion for Determination of Deficiency Amount; (2) the
 April 23, 2012 Judgment; (3) the July 30, 2012 order denying
 Borrowers' June 12, 2012 motion to disqualify Judge Ayabe from
 all proceedings in Civil No. 09-1-2523-10 and to set aside all
 orders and judgments entered by Judge Ayabe; and (4) the
 August 1, 2012 deemed denial of Borrowers' May 3, 2012 motion for
 reconsideration and rehearing. This appeal was given appellate
 case number CAAP-12-0000758.
 
III.
 
A.
 
To the extent that it can be discerned, Borrowers'
 
8
first point error  apparently is that KKP lacked standing to
foreclose, bid at auction, or receive a deficiency judgment. 
Borrowers allege that the Circuit Court erred in its October 3,
 2011 Order Confirming Sale and Judgment Confirming Sale. 
Borrowers provide only limited and sporadic record citations for
 the facts they assert are related to this issue.
 
Moreover, the September 1, 2010 Foreclosure Order

 
unambiguously concluded that Borrowers consented to the Banks'
 right to sell their interests in the loans to third parties. On
 December 6, 2010, the Banks filed their motion to substitute KKP
 in the place of the Banks. The Banks asserted that on or about
 November 30, 2010, the Banks sold all of their interests in the
 Infrastructure Loan and Villas Loan and associated documents to
 
8
 Borrowers' Amended Opening Brief is in substantial non-compliance
with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b), most notably
because it provides inadequate record citations throughout. This deficiency
is particularly disturbing in light of this court's March 27, 2013 Orderstriking Borrowers' opening brief and exhibits for violations of HRAP Rule28(b) with the admonition that "[f]ailure to comply with HRAP Rule 28 or thisorder may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the appeal." Both briefs were filed by Borrowers' counsel, Gary V. Dubin. 
This court adheres to the policy of deciding parties' cases on the
merits where possible, O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386,
885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994), and we will endeavor to do so here. However, inlight of the repeated violations of court rules by counsel, we will also referhim to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for his conduct in this case. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRB and that on or about December 1, 2010, HRB transferred all
 
of those interests to KKP. Borrowers did not object to the
 substitution of KKP for the Banks. On December 30, 2010, the
 Circuit Court entered its Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for
 Substitution of Parties Filed December 6, 2010 and Borrowers did
 not appeal or otherwise challenge this order at the time.
 
Finally, Borrowers' arguments do not undermine KKP's 
standing in this case. As best as can be determined, Borrowers argue that, because KKP and its predecessor in interest HRB, allegedly made misrepresentations, failed to disclose information and otherwise breached agreements in Borrowers' failed attempt to secure their release from the loans involved in this action, KKP does not have standing to pursue the foreclosure and deficiency awarded in this case. Whatever attempts Borrowers may have made to renegotiate their loans in the interim, it is undisputed that the Banks ultimately assigned their interests in the Infrastructure and Villas Notes and mortgages to HRB, who in turn assigned its interest to KKP. "[B]orrowers do not have standing to challenge the validity of an assignment of [their] loans because they are not parties to the agreement and because noncompliance with a trust's governing document is irrelevant to the assignee's standing to foreclose." U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. 
Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175, 338 P.3d 1185, 1190 (App. 2014). 
Similarly, Borrowers arguments here do not undermine KKP's standing to pursue this action. 
B.
 
Borrowers' second point of error appears to be that
 
Civil No. 09-1-2523-10 and Civil No. 11-1-1577-07 should have
 been consolidated. Borrowers provide no citations to the parts
 of the record relied on and no legal authority whatsoever in
 their argument.
 
Although Rule 42(a) is designed to encourage
consolidation where a common question of law or fact is
present, the trial court is given broad discretion to decide
whether consolidation would be desirable. The trial court's
 discretionary determination will not be reversed on appeal
absent clear error or exigent circumstances.
 
Kainz v. Lussier, 4 Haw. App. 400, 407, 667 P.2d 797, 803 (1983)
 
(internal quotations marks and citations omitted). 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Borrowers failed to carry their burden of persuasion. 
In Sheehan, this court applied Kainz to uphold the trial court's 
denial of appellant's HRCP Rule 42(a) motion to consolidate. Sheehan v. Grove Farm Co., 114 Hawai
'i 376, 394, 163 P.3d 179, 
197 (App. 2005). Under facts similar to the instant case, the Sheehan court upheld the denial because, although the two cases involved the same issues, the two cases were in completely disparate procedural postures. Id. In the instant case, Civil 
No. 09-1-2523-10 was in its final stages, awaiting a confirmation of foreclosure sale, whereas Civil No. 11-1-1577-07 was newly filed and attempting to resuscitate claims decided in Civil No. 09-1-2523-10. 
The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it
 
denied Borrowers' August 4, 2011 Motion to Consolidate.
C.
 
Borrowers' third point on appeal denominated "KKD and
 
Fuchs' Claims Should Not Have Been Dismissed Absent Discovery," 
summarized in their argument section as
 
Genuine issues of material fact existed precluding summary
adjudication, which however Judge Ayabe granted in awarding
confirmation of sale over objections as to adequacy of price
and in dismissing the new action against HRB and KKP based
on his interpretation of documents that were being
challenged for fraud and rescission
 
is incomprehensible and therefore could be considered waived. 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). Moreover, to the extent it challenges the
 confirmation of sale based on the existence of genuine issues of
 material fact, Borrowers have failed to identify those facts or
 where they were brought to the attention of the Circuit Court. 
To the extent it seeks review of the dismissal of the "new
 action"--we presume Civil No. 11-1-1577-07 BIA--we have no
 jurisdiction to do so, as that case is not before us in this
 appeal.

In their fourth asserted point of error, Borrowers
 
challenge the Circuit Court's July 30, 2012 Order denying their

 We note that on March 30, 2016, this court dismissed the appeal in
appellate case CAAP-13-0004290 from Civil No. 11-1-1577-07 BIA for lack of
jurisdiction.

Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), "[a]n HRCP Rule 60(b)

Lua, 92 Hawai
'i 228, 234, 990 P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999). The 
Borrowers did not file their June 12, 2012 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion within ten days after entry of the April 23, 2012 deficiency judgment (or any previous judgment), and therefore the June 12, 2012 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion did not invoke the tolling provision under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) that would enable the Borrowers to obtain appellate review of the July 30, 2012 post-judgment order by way of their appeal from the April 23, 2012 deficiency judgment pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).

Borrowers' June 12, 2012 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to
 set aside all judgments (based upon the argument that the
 presiding judge should have been disqualified) is an
 independently appealable post-judgment order that the Borrowers
 failed to timely appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). Therefore this
 court lacks jurisdiction over the Borrowers' appeal to the extent
 that they challenge the July 30, 2012 post-judgment order denying
 Borrower's June 12, 2012 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to
 set aside all judgments. 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Therefore, Borrowers'
 August 31, 2012 notice of appeal is untimely as to the July 30,
 
10
 Although Borrowers also moved to disqualify Judge Ayabe on
November 25, 2011, they have not presented any legal argument regarding the
January 27, 2012 order denying this motion We therefore deem any challenge to
this order waived. HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).

Borrowers argue that the Circuit Court violated their 
due process rights when it "determined the amount of the deficiency judgment here by merely using a calculator to subtract the net proceeds of sale from the amount found owed." Although Borrowers provide no citations to the parts of the record relied on, they appear to assert (1) that the final bid price at auction was grossly inadequate, and (2) the process in Hawai
'i for 
determining deficiency judgments violates procedural due process. The crux of Borrowers' argument is that this court should adopt a "fair market value"-based approach to deficiency judgment calculations and that there should be an evidentiary hearing to determine the value of the property received by the foreclosing mortgagee which would then be subtracted from the amount owed in order to determine the amount of the deficiency judgment. 
However, Borrowers have waived this challenge to the
 
method used to determine the deficiency judgment. The
 Foreclosure Order provided: "Plaintiffs are entitled to a
 deficiency judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Fuchs,
 individually, for the difference between the amount owed to
 Plaintiffs under the Infrastructure Loan Documents and the Villas
 Loan Documents, and the foreclosure proceeds applied thereto." 
Borrowers' appeal from the Foreclosure Order was dismissed by
 stipulation. Therefore, Borrowers are precluded from indirectly
 challenging the Foreclosure Order and the method by which the
 deficiency judgment would be ascertained that was contained
 therein.
 
Moreover, Borrowers identify no evidence in the record
 
that demonstrates the fair market value of the Infrastructure
 Property and Villas Property at the time of foreclosure sale. 
Borrowers presented no evidence with their Memorandum in

 As no transcript of the hearing on the motion has been included in

was at the time of the foreclosure sale or disposition of the
 
motion to determine the deficiency amount. Therefore, even if we
 were to accept Borrowers' contention, Borrowers did not present
 to the Circuit Court evidence that the foreclosure sales price
 was short of fair market value. 
Furthermore, Borrowers' argument that due process 
requires this court to change the procedure and method of determining any deficiency is unsupported by the authority they cite. First, Borrowers ignore that under existing Hawai
'i case 
law, they had the opportunity to challenge the fairness of the auction price, and thus, the resulting deficiency judgment. See 
Hoge v. Kane, 4 Haw. App. 533, 540, 670 P.2d 36, 40 (1983) (stating, in a case where foreclosure defendants objected to the auction price, that "[i]f the highest bid is so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience, the court should refuse to confirm"); see also Indus. Mortg. Co. v. Smith, 94 Hawai
'i 502, 
17 P.3d 851 (App. 2001); Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai
'i 11, 18, 304 P.3d 1192, 1199 (2013) (noting the 
right to object to confirmation of a sale due to a grossly inadequate sale price). Here, Borrowers did not object to confirmation of the sale based on the sales price. Second, even if the majority of jurisdictions use the fair market value in calculating the deficiency amount, the vast majority of these have had it imposed by statute and primarily to address deficiencies arising from non-judicial foreclosure sales. See, 
e.g., Sostaric v. Marshall, 766 S.E.2d 396 (W. Va. 2014) (citing, in support of its assertion use of fair market value is the majority view, twenty-two states who adopted this measure by statute and four who did so by judicial decision). Hawai
'i's 
foreclosure statute has been amended several times, most recently in 2015. The Legislature has not yet seen fit to provide this measure in determining a deficiency in judicial foreclosure actions. By contrast, we note the Legislature, in 2012, saw fit 
11(...continued)
reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of
providing an adequate transcript.'" Bettencourt v. Bettencourt
, 80 Hawai' i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (brackets omitted) (quoting Union Bldg.Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87(1984)).

to limit deficiency judgments against resident-homeowner­
mortgagors involved in a power of sale (non-judicial) foreclosure. HRS § 667-38 (Supp. 2015). Therefore, it appears the Legislature has afforded protections to mortgagors when it deems it appropriate to do so. We decline to adopt further protections beyond those already provided by Hawai
'i case law or 
granted by the Legislature.
