IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
TERRY J. DAVIS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-11-032838)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Terry J. Davis (Davis) appeals from 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment 
(Judgment and Order) filed on January 11, 2012 in the District 
Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division (district court).1 
Davis was charged by an amended complaint with
 
Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been
 
Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence
 
of An Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2011).
 
After the charge against Davis was read, Davis moved to
 
dismiss the case because the charge was insufficient for failing
 
to include a state of mind allegation.

The motion was denied and Davis was found guilty as
 
charged after trial. 
On appeal, Davis contends:
 
(1) the State failed to adduce sufficient evidence to
 
support the conviction because there was insufficient evidence
 (a) that Davis operated a vehicle on a public, way, street, or
 
highway; (b) to connect Davis to Exhibit 1, the Judgment of
 
Conviction and Probation Sentence in Cr. No. 06-1-0933; (c) to
 
establish that Davis was the individual sentenced to a driver's
 
license revocation, suspension, or restriction; (d) to establish
 
that on July 22, 2011, Davis intentionally, knowingly, or
 
recklessly operated a vehicle while his driver's license had been
 
revoked, suspended, or restricted; (e) to establish that Davis'
 
driver's license was revoked, suspended or restricted pursuant to
 
the applicable statutes on July 22, 2011; (f) to establish that
 
Davis' operation of the vehicle on July 22, 2011 was in violation
 
of the restrictions placed on his driver's license; (g) to
 
establish that Davis was subject to sentencing for a second
 
offense in a five-year period;
 
(2) the District Court erred by admitting Exhibit 1
 
because it was not properly certified and thus not self-
authenticating;
 
(3) double jeopardy precludes a retrial on the same
 
charge; 
(4) assuming arguendo that there is sufficient evidence 
to sustain the conviction, State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 
P.3d 617 (2012) mandates a new trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
hold that the charge against Davis was defective and thus
 
2
 Supreme Court held that the offense under HRS § 291-4.5 requires 
an intentional, knowing, or reckless state of mind. The 
statutory language does not expressly impose absolute liability 
and there is nothing in the legislative history of HRS § 291-4.5 
or § 291E-62 that "unequivocally indicates an intent to eliminate 
the state of mind requirement." State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i 
314, 321, 288 P.3d 788, 795 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Therefore, the charge against Davis needed to allege 
the required mens rea. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 P.3d at 
625.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to Nesmith, the case must be dismissed without
 prejudice.
 
In Nesmith, the Supreme Court held: (1) mens rea must 
be alleged in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause 
of the accusation and (2) mens rea need not be alleged (or 
proven) in a charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), 
because the legislative intent to impose absolute liability for 
an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. Nesmith, 127 
Hawai'i at 52-56, 276 P.3d at 621-25. 
The State concedes that HRS § 291E-62 is not a strict 
or absolute liability offense and that a charge for violating 
HRS § 291E-62 requires an allegation of mens rea pursuant to 
Nesmith. We agree. As noted by the State, HRS § 291E-62 
substantially reenacted HRS § 291-4.5. State v. Young, 107 
Hawai'i 36, 38, 109 P.3d 677, 679 (2005). Previously, in State 
v. Vliet
, 95 Hawai' i 94, 99, 19 P.3d 42, 47 (2001), the Hawai' i 
Since Davis objected to the charge at the beginning of 
trial and the charge failed to allege the requisite state of mind, the District Court erred in denying Davis' motion to 
dismiss the case. In 
Gonzalez, the Hawai' i Supreme Court stated 
that "Nesmith held that state of mind must be included in a 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
charge or the case must be dismissed without prejudice. Because 
the charge here did not contain the requisite state of mind, as 
the State concedes, Nesmith mandates dismissal without 
prejudice." Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d at 798. 
Davis contends that, because his appeal also challenges
 
the sufficiency of the evidence, double jeopardy principles apply
 
even though the initial charging document was defective. In
 
other words, Davis' argument is that there was insufficient
 
evidence to sustain the conviction and therefore double jeopardy
 
precludes a retrial on the same charge; but, assuming arguendo
 
that there is sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction,
 
Nesmith mandates a new trial. We do not agree that we should
 
reach the sufficiency of the evidence or double jeopardy issues.
 
As noted above, the Hawai' i Supreme Court in Gonzalez 
stated that where the charge did not contain the requisite state 
of mind, "Nesmith mandates dismissal without prejudice." 128 
Hawai'i at 324, 288 P.3d at 798 (emphasis added). Moreover, the 
supreme court reached this conclusion even though the defendant 
had also challenged whether the State had carried its burden of 
proof at trial. That is, the defendant in Gonzalez had been 
convicted of excessive speeding and his appeal challenged both 
(1) the charge for failing to allege the requisite mens rea and
 
(2) the trial court's finding that the State had put forth a 
prima facie case, alleging that the State had failed to lay a 
sufficient foundation for admission of a laser gun speed reading. 
128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d at 790-91. After determining that 
the charge was defective and that the case should be dismissed without prejudice, the supreme court stated that "[d]ue to the 
likelihood of retrial on remand, Defendant's argument that the 
State failed to lay an adequate foundation for the introduction 
of the speed reading from the laser gun is addressed to prevent 
further error." Id. at 316-17, 288 P.3d at 798 (emphasis added). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The court then determined that the State had failed to lay a
 
proper foundation for the speed reading. Id. at 327, 288 P.3d at
 
801. The supreme court thus reached the evidence question only
 
to provide guidance for the anticipated retrial on the same
 
charge, and notwithstanding its determination that critical
 
evidence was improperly admitted, the court expected that a
 
retrial on the charge was likely.
 
Although double jeopardy was not raised in Gonzalez,
 
the supreme court has addressed the issue sua sponte when the
 
court has deemed it necessary. See State v. Bannister, 60 Haw.
 
658, 660, 594 P.2d 133, 135 (1979) (addressing double jeopardy
 
issue although defendant did not raise it because the court's
 
determination that the State failed to prove a required element
 
at trial required the court to decide whether to remand for a new
 
trial or instruct the trial court to enter a judgment of
 
acquittal.) Thus, Gonzalez suggests that, where a charge is
 
defective for failing to allege the requisite mens rea, it is not
 
necessary to reach the questions of sufficiency of the evidence
 
and double jeopardy.
 
Relying on Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969),
 
Davis contends that "double jeopardy principles apply even where,
 
as here, the initial charging document was defective." Benton,
 
however, does not benefit Davis in this case. Rather, in Benton,
 the United States Supreme Court held that double jeopardy
 
prohibited a retrial of a larceny charge because the defendant
 
had previously been acquitted of that charge. 395 U.S. at 796­
97. The need to re-indict the defendant in that case was not the
 
reason why double jeopardy applied.
 
We therefore hold that under Nesmith, the charge in
 
this case against Davis was defective for failing to allege the
 
requisite mens rea and the case should have been dismissed

without prejudice. We need not address Davis' other points of
 
error.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on January 11, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division is 
vacated. The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case without prejudice.
