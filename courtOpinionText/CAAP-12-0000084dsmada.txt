APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC10-1-9873)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/
 
Appellants Michael S.C. Rompel and Karla Lima Rompel's (the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rompel Appellants) appeal from the Honorable Michael K.
 
Tanigawa's January 10, 2012 judgment, because the district court
 has not yet expressly resolved all of the parties' multiple
 claims in this district court case, as Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) requires for an appeal from
 a district court civil case.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. A final order means an order ending the proceeding,
leaving nothing further to be accomplished. When a written
 judgment, order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving
nothing further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or
decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The requirement of a separate judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is "not 
applicable to district court cases." Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 
142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253. Nevertheless, a 
district court judgment or order is not final and appealable unless the judgment or order ends the proceeding by resolving the last remaining cause of action, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. Id. at 426, 984 P.2d at 1252. 
In the instant case, the district court has attempted
 
to resolve the claims in this case through a series of three
 documents: (1) an April 14, 2011 judgment for possession, (2) an
 October 4, 2011 memorandum of decision, and (3) the January 10,
 2012 judgment. Under analogous circumstances, the supreme court
 has held that,
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.
 
S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw.
 
480, 494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal
 quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted). However, the
 April 14, 2011 judgment for possession, the October 4, 2011
 memorandum of decision, and the January 10, 2012 judgment do not
 specifically address and resolve each and every one of the five
 counts in Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Helen E.
 Paglinawan's (Appellee Paglinawan) December 21, 2010 first
 amended complaint and each and every one of the fifteen counts in
 the Rompel Appellants' December 20, 2010 first amended
 counterclaim. For example, the April 14, 2011 judgment for
 possession, the October 4, 2011 memorandum of decision, and the
 January 10, 2012 judgment do not expressly resolve Count 3 (for
 breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing) in
 Appellee Paglinawan's December 21, 2010 first amended complaint,
 nor do they expressly resolve Count 13 (for assumpsit) in the
 Rompel Appellants' December 20, 2010 first amended counterclaim. 
Furthermore, several of the references to causes of action in the
 October 4, 2011 memorandum of decision and the January 10, 2012
 judgment are too vague in that they do not specify the counts to
 which they relate. Consequently, the January 10, 2012 judgment
 is not a final judgment that is appealable pursuant to HRS § 641­1(a). Absent written, operative language that expressly
 adjudicates each and every one of the five counts in Appellee

Paglinawan's December 21, 2010 first amended complaint and each
 
and every one of the fifteen counts in the Rompel Appellants'
 December 20, 2010 first amended counterclaim, the Rompel
 Appellants' appeal is premature, and we lack jurisdiction over
 Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000084. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000084 is
 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
