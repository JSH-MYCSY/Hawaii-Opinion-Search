SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Pro se Claimant-Appellant Vinh Alkire-Clemen (Alkire-
Clemen) appeals from the "Order Adopting Proposed Decision and
 
Order" filed January 11, 2012, and the "Order Denying Claimant's
 
January 13, 2012 Request For Reconsideration And Oral Argument"
 
filed January 19, 2012 by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board (LIRAB). LIRAB decided in favor of Employer-
Appellee Castle Medical Center and Insurance Adjuster-Appellee
 
Crawford and Company.
 
On appeal, Alkire-Clemen contends LIRAB erred in
 
finding her claim for Workers' Compensation was time barred.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Alkire­
Clemen's appeal is without merit. 
Alkire-Clemen contends LIRAB erred by concluding her
 
August 2002 claim for Workers' Compensation was time barred. In
 
the Proposed Decision and Order filed December 12, 2011, LIRAB
 
made the following findings: (1) the injury manifested itself in
 
February 1999; (2) Alkire-Clemen first contacted LIRAB about the
 
injury in October 2001; and, (3) Alkire-Clemen filed a claim with
 
LIRAB in August 2002.
 
In order for a workers' compensation claim to be
 
timely, the claimant must satisfy Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
ÿÿ 386-82 (1993), which provides in relevant part: 
The right to compensation under this chapter shall be barred
unless a written claim thereof is made to the director of
 labor and industrial relations (1) within two years after
the date at which the effects of the injury for which the
employee is entitled to compensation have become manifest,
and (2) within five years after the date of the accident or
occurrence which caused the injury.
 
"The limitation period for a claim does not begin to run until 
the claimant, as a reasonable person, should recognize the 
nature, seriousness, and probable compensable character of an 
injury or disease." Hayashi v. Scott Co. , 93 Hawai» i 8, 10, 994 
P.2d 1054, 1056 (2000) (citing Demond v. Univ. of Hawai» i, 54 
Haw. 98, 104, 503 P.2d 434, 438 (1972)). Manifestation of an 
injury may become apparent when the injury prevents the claimant 
from performing ordinary work duties or when the claimant seeks 
medical attention for the injury. Hayashi, 93 Hawai» i at 12, 994 
P.2d at 1058; Tomita v. Hotel Service Center , 2 Haw. App. 157, 
159, 628 P.2d 205, 208 (1981). 
Alkire-Clemen concedes that she filed a claim for the
 
February 1999 injury more than 30 months after the date of the
 
injury. However, Alkire-Clemen claims the injury did not

manifest until March 2001, making her August 2002 claim timely. 
The first medical documentation of the manifestation of Alkire­
Clemen's February 1999 injury was September 1, 1999, when a
 
physician treating Alkire-Clemen noted her complaint of increased
 
pain since the February 1999 work incident. The physician
 
documented that Alkire-Clemen sought treatment for the worsening
 
pain which prevented Alkire-Clemen from returning to work. LIRAB
 
did not err in finding Alkire-Clemen's February 1999 injury
 
manifested when Alkire-Clemen sought treatment for this injury in
 
September 1999. Therefore, LIRAB did not err in concluding
 
Alkire-Clemen's claim was time barred.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Adopting Proposed
 
Decision and Order" filed January 11, 2012, and the "Order
 Denying Claimant's January 13, 2012 Request For Reconsideration
 
And Oral Argument" filed January 19, 2012 by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board are affirmed.
