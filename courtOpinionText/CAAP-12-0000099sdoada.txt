and against Plaintiff-Appellee County of Hawai' i. 
Tierney allegedly burglarized a store that Defendants-
Appellees H. Kimura Store, Inc., Irene Kimura and Brian Kimura
 
owned and operated. Tierney allegedly stole money in the amount
 
of $3,698. The County arrested Tierney and seized the $3,689. 
However, the County never asserted criminal charges against
 
Tierney. Consequently, the County desired to return the $3,698
 
to the rightful owner. In an attempt to return the money to the
 
rightful owner, the County filed a complaint for interpleader
 
against the Kimuras and Tierney. The County never served Tierney
 
with the complaint.
 
On June 7, 2001, the circuit court entered an order 
dismissing the County's complaint for want of service as to 
Tierney pursuant to the Rules of the Circuit Court of the State 
of Hawai' i (RCCH) Rule 28. 
On July 30, 2001, the circuit court entered an order
 
dismissing the remainder of this case for want of prosecution
 
pursuant to RCCH Rule 12(q).
 
The circuit court did not immediately enter a final
 
judgment.
 
This case remained inactive for approximately nine
 
years.
 
On April 7, 2010, Tierney filed a motion entitled 
"Chief Judge Ronald Ibarra Police Report F-93960 Motion for 
Return of Property $5,000.00[.]" The circuit court deemed this 
motion to be an Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b) 
motion to set aside the June 7, 2001 order dismissing the County's complaint as to Tierney.

On July 1, 2010, the circuit court entered an order
 
denying Tierney's motion entitled "Chief Judge Ronald Ibarra
 
Police Report F-93960 Motion for Return of Property $5,000.00[.]"
 
On July 21, 2010, Tierney filed a document that appears
 
to be a notice of appeal from the July 1, 2010 order denying
 
Tierney's motion entitled "Chief Judge Ronald Ibarra Police
 
Report F-93960 Motion for Return of Property $5,000.00[.]" The
 
appellate court clerk gave this appeal appellate court case
 
number 30630.
 
On September 2, 2011, this court entered an order
 
dismissing appellate court case number 30630 for lack of
 
jurisdiction.
 
On January 27, 2012, the circuit court entered a final
 
judgment in favor of Tierney and the Kimura Defendants and
 
against the County.
 
On February 15, 2012, Tierney filed a notice of appeal
 
from the January 27, 2012 judgment. This appeal received
 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000099.
 
On March 6, 2012, Tierney filed a second notice of
 
appeal from the January 27, 2012 judgment. This appeal received
 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000136.
 
On May 21, 2012, this court entered an order
 
consolidating appellate court case numbers CAAP-12-0000099 and
 
CAAP-12-0000136 under appellate court case number CAAP-12Â­
0000099.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
submitted and having given due consideration to the argument
 
advanced and the issue raised, as well as the relevant statutory
 
and case law, we conclude this appeal is without merit.
