IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
LINDA KIDWELL, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
 
MVCI WAIOHAI BEACH CLUB, Employer-Appellee,
and
 
INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee,

APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(AB NO. 2009-247(K); (4-07-00388))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Linda Kidwell appeals from the
 
Decision and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board ("Board") on January 11, 2012 ("January 2012
 Decision and Order"). After a work-related incident occurring on
 September 22, 2006 ("September 2006 Work Injury"), the Director
 of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations Disability
 Compensation Division ("Director") entered a decision on
 December 24, 2007 ("December 2007 Decision") in which Employer-
Appellee MVCI Waiohai Beach Club ("Employer"), Insurance Carrier-
Appellee Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania and
 Insurance Adjuster-Appellee Marriott Claims Services voluntarily
 accepted liability for Kidwell's injury. 
Director augmented the December 2007 Decision with a
 
supplemental decision on April 3, 2009 ("April 2009 Supplemental
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Decision"). On April 23, 2009, Kidwell requested reconsideration
 
of, and in the alternative appealed from, the Director's April
 2009 Supplemental Decision to the Board. The Director denied
 reconsideration and forwarded the appeal to the Board. 
The instant dispute arises out of the Board's January
 
2012 Decision and Order where the Board affirmed the Director's
 April 2009 Supplemental Decision, stating that Employer properly
 denied Dr. J. Julian Grove's treatment plans, and credited the
 opinions of Dr. James H. Maxwell, Dr. Zoran Maric, and Dr. Paul
 M. Francis, and declined to credit the opinion of Dr. Grove. We
 conclude that the Board did not err and, therefore, we affirm the
 January 2012 Decision and Order.
 
I.	 BACKGROUND
 
On September 22, 2006, Kidwell was employed by Employer
 
as a salesperson of time share interests. While showing a time
 
share property to a potential customer on that day, Kidwell
 stepped off of a paved path and lost her footing, sustaining
 multiple injuries. Kidwell reports that she attempted to
 continue working, but was unable to do so due to increasing pain
 in her back. 
A.	 Kidwell's relevant pre-September 22, 2006 medical
history
 
It is unclear from the record exactly what injury
 
Kidwell sustained prior to the September 2006 Work Injury, but an
 
MRI dated May 22, 2006 is discussed in the record, specifically
 the L4-5 area. According to Dr. Maric, this MRI shows "a small
 broad-based disc bulge at L4-5." Kidwell claims that she was
 asymptomatic prior to the September 2006 Work Injury. 
B.	 Kidwell's post-injury physician evaluations
 
1.	 Dr. Grove's Opinions
 
Kidwell was originally seen at the Kauai Medical
 
Clinic, where she was treated with medications and epidural
 
steroid injections. She moved from Kauai to Arizona in September
 2007. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kidwell presented to Dr. Grove on October 23, 2007. 
Dr. Grove initially assessed Kidwell as having degeneration of
 
lumbar or lumbosacral intervertebre, and Thoracic or lumbosacral
 neuritis or radiculitis. In a letter dated March 12, 2008, Dr.
 Grove distinguished between Kidwell's objective and subjective
 issues, noting that objectively she had a cervical annular tear
 at C4-5, disk dessication at T4-5 through T9-10, and multileval
 degenerative disease and disc herniation at L3-4 with an annular
 tear at L4-5. Dr. Grove concluded that Kidwell was "totally and
 permanently disabled" with a long-term outlook of "chronic pain
 syndrome." He noted that, subjectively, she was reporting whole
 body pain and severe pain with mild palpitation to her joints. 
According to Dr. Lisa S. Splittstoesser's telephone
 
call record dated April 1, 2008, Dr. Grove felt that Kidwell's
 pain was out of proportion to her objective findings. Dr.
 Splittstoesser further noted that she was not sure whether
 Kidwell's condition was work related based upon Dr. Grove's
 opinion. 
In a September 23, 2008 letter, Dr. Grove reported that
 
Kidwell was functionally disabled and unable to work from
 August 1 to December 1, 2008, and noted that he hoped she could
 return to work in 2009. On October 22, 2008 Dr. Grove prepared a
 Workers' Compensation Treatment Plan form on which he diagnosed
 Kidwell with "Chronic low back pain [with] left leg radiating
 pain." On November 7, 2008, Dr. Grove rated Kidwell's impairment
 at 75%. By December 12, 2008, Dr. Grove's diagnosis was simply
 "pain."
 
While Kidwell was being treated by Dr. Grove, she was
 
also seen by Dr. Ali Araghi. Records indicate that she saw Dr.
 Araghi on April 30, 2008, and again on July 9, 2008. Dr. Araghi
 reportedly was "unable to explain what is causing [Kidwell's]
 right leg pain and the severe amount of pain that she has." He
 "d[id] not think she [was] a good surgical candidate," and
 recommended "that she follow up with pain management." 
2. Dr. Maxwell's Opinions
 
Dr. Maxwell met with Kidwell on November 6, 2008 and
 
reported his findings, specifically that she was symptomatic of
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[s]evere pain in back to both legs. She report[ed] 'electric
 
shocks' pains[,] [and Dr. Maxwell] [o]bserved uncontrollable
 crying." Dr. Maxwell referred Kidwell to Dr. Maric, and
 commented that "[n]o surgical interventions [were] available" and
 that there was "no evidence of industrially-related spine
 disorder." In a supplemental report of the same date, Dr.
 Maxwell stated that he told Kidwell that she had no treatable
 spine lesion and concluded that Kidwell was "now permanent and
 stationary with a zero percent work impairment rating." 
3. Dr. Maric's Opinions
 
Dr. Maric examined Kidwell on December 3, 2008, and
 
authored a report of his findings. Dr. Maric reported that
 Kidwell stated that she was involved in a motor vehicle accident
 several years ago and that she had a lumbar discectomy in 1996. 
Kidwell stated that she had complete relief of her pain with that
 surgery, though she experienced some "pressure" in her lower back
 now and then with weather changes. She added that she
 experienced low back pain in May 2006, and that it was "driving
 [her] insane." Kidwell said that she went to Dr. Rao, received a
 shot and her pain resolved. 
Dr. Maric reviewed Kidwell's medical records, including
 
a pre-work-accident MRI of her spine. Specifically, Dr. Maric
 reported that he relied on MRI images from May 22, 2006 (preÂ­work-accident), March 26, 2007, April 3, 2007, October 24, 2007,
 and March 28, 2008. Dr. Kidwell opined, based on these images,
 that there had been no significant change from the May 2006 image
 to the October 2007 image. Dr. Maric further opined that the
 March 2008 image revealed that the L3-4 disc bulge had narrowed
 and was downgraded to a small disc bulge. He also considered x-
ray images of Kidwell's spine dated September 10, 2008, in which
 he noted a similar narrowing of the L4-5 and L5-S1 disc space,
 and commented that there had been no degenerative change. 
Ultimately, Dr. Maric concluded that Kidwell "at most
 
sustained a lumbar sprain/strain with the work-related incident
 in question" and that "[t]here is no objective evidence of any
 type of structural injury to her spine." In commenting on the
 L4-5 bulge present in the various MRI images, Dr. Maric commented
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
that if the bulge were the cause of Kidwell's pain, she would be
 
experiencing pain in the buttock, groin, and anterior thigh down
 to the knee, and that the pain would be limited to the left side. 
Dr. Maric cited to an attached pain chart to indicate
 
that the pain Kidwell reports must have a nonorganic source, as
 "[t]hese types of global complaints . . . are typical of
 individuals who have nonorganic pain." Dr. Maric found that
 Kidwell was not a candidate for any active treatment. 
Furthermore, he concluded that there was no basis for any present
 work restrictions. Finally, he concluded that "[i]f the
 nonorganic nature of her condition needs to be confirmed[,] then
 I would recommend an independent psychological evaluation with a
 personality inventory (MMPI)." 
Dr. Maric authored an addendum report reviewing an MRI
 
dated January 13, 2009, in which he identified that there was now
 a "large left-sided disc herniation at L3-4". He stated that the
 new MRI images do not change his medical opinion, that the areas
 where she would be experiencing pain would be the same as his
 first report, the left buttock, groin, and leg ending at the
 knee. He concluded that "I do not find any objective evidence
 that she injured the L3-4 disc on September 22, 2006," and stated
 that the later scans confirmed in his mind that Kidwell's pain
 complaints were nonorganic. 
4. Dr Francis's Opinions
 
Dr. Francis performed a neurosurgical consultation upon
 
referral by Dr. Grove. Dr. Francis recommended repeat MRI and
 EMG studies. In his July 31, 2009 Progress Note, Dr. Francis
 noted that he saw no evidence of any nerve root compression, but
 did see evidence of multilevel degenerative disc disease, present
 at L5-S1, and a C4-5 disc herniation. On November 16, 2009, Dr.
 Francis performed a discectomy, in which he decompressed the
 exiting L3 nerve root and the L5 nerve root.
 
C. Kidwell's treatment claims
 
Pursuant to the Director's December 2007 Decision,
 
Employer was ordered to pay for medical care, services, and
 
supplies as the nature of the injury may require, in addition to
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
temporary total disability ("TTD") benefits from March 13, 2007
 
to October 25, 2007. Based on a hearing which occurred on
 
July 3, 2008, the Director ordered that additional TTD benefits
 for be paid out for the period of October 26, 2007 to August 31,
 2008. 
Dr. Grove submitted a Worker's Compensation Treatment 
Plan in letter format to Employer on October 8, 2008 ("October 8, 2008 Plan"), a Workers' Compensation Treatment Plan dated October 22, 2008 ("October 22, 2008 Plan"), a Provider Treatment Plan dated November 7, 2008 ("November 7, 2008 Plan"), and a Provider Treatment Plan (Ltd) dated December 31, 2008 ("December 31, 2008 Plan"). Each plan was denied by Employer as insufficient under Hawai
'i Administrative Rules section 12-15Â­
32(b) and because Employer's position was that the September 2006 Work Injury was not the cause of Kidwell's ongoing spine condition. The Director's April 2009 Supplemental Decision noted that the parties agreed that the purported October 8, 2008 Plan "was not in fact a treatment plan." The Director found that the October 22, 2008 Plan, the November 7, 2008 Plan, and the December 31, 2008 Plan were properly denied. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Kidwell contends that the Board erred in (1)
 
crediting Dr. Maxwell's opinion (Finding of Fact ("FOF") 18); (2)
 
crediting Dr. Maric's opinion (FOF 26); (3) crediting Dr.
 Francis's opinion (FOF 44); (4) refusing to credit Dr. Grove's
 disability opinions (FOF 47); (5) crediting the opinions of Drs.
 Maxwell, Maric, and Francis over the opinions of Drs. Grove and
 Christopher A. Yeung, and in finding that the medical care,
 services, and supplies requested by Dr. Grove's treatment plans
 were not reasonably required by the nature of Kidwell's
 September 22, 2006 Work Injury (FOF 48); (6) concluding that
 Kidwell was not entitled to the medical care, service, and
 supplies requested by Dr. Grove's treatment plans (Conclusion of
 Law ("COL") 1); (7) in finding no evidence that Kidwell was
 temporarily and totally disabled after December 12, 2008 as a
 result of her September 22, 2006 Work Injury (FOF 49); (8)
 
6
  
 
 
     
    
    
    
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
concluding that Kidwell is not entitled to further TTD benefits
 
beyond December 12, 2008 (COL 2); and (9) ruling on the period of
 Kidwell's period of disability when the compensability of her
 subsequent falls and injuries had not been determined by the
 Disability Compensation Division (FOF 48). 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Administrative Agency Appeals - From LIRAB
 
Ordinarily, deference will be given to decisions of
administrative agencies acting within the realm of their
expertise. The rule of judicial deference, however, does
not apply when the agency's reading of the statute
contravenes the legislature's manifest purpose.
Consequently, we have not hesitated to reject an incorrect
or unreasonable statutory construction advanced by the
agency entrusted with the statute's implementation.
 
Coon v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai 'i 233, 245, 47 P.3d 
348, 360 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citations, and
 
brackets omitted).
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS
Â§ 91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
 instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse
or modify the decision and order if the substantial
rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced
 because the administrative findings, conclusions,
decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In	 violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2) In	 excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly 	 erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6) Arbitrary, 	 or capricious, or characterized by
 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
 exercise of discretion.
 
We have previously stated: 
[Findings of Fact] are reviewable under the clearly
erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision
was clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record. 
[Conclusions of Law] are freely reviewable to determine
if the agency's decision was in violation of
 constitutional or statutory provisions, in excess of
statutory authority or jurisdiction of agency, or
affected by other error of law.
 
7
  
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
A [Conclusion of Law] that presents mixed questions of
fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous
standard because the conclusion is dependent upon the
facts and circumstances of the particular case. When
 mixed questions of law and fact are presented, an
appellate court must give deference to the agency's
expertise and experience in the particular field. The
 court should not substitute its own judgment for that of
the agency.
 
Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai 'i 402, 405-06, 38 P.3d 570, 
573-74 (2001) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets
 
in original omitted) (quoting In re Water Use Permit
 Applications, 94 Hawai
'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)). 
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial
 
evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2)
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  We have
 defined "substantial evidence" as credible evidence which is
 of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

IV.	 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Board did not err when it credited the opinions of
Dr. Maxwell, Dr. Maric, and Dr. Francis, and declined
to credit the opinions of Dr. Grove. 
The Board credited the opinions of Dr. Maxwell, Dr.
 
Maric, and Dr. Francis in FOF 18, 26, and 44, respectively. The
 
Board declined to credit the opinions of Dr. Grove in FOF 47. 
Appellant claims that the Board erred in making those findings. 
The four primary physicians in this case, all reviewed
 
the same documents, the various MRI images, and concluded the
 same thing, that there is a mild stable bulging disc at L4-5.
 Drs. Maric and Grove also found evidence of an annular tear
 present. Two of the four (Dr. Grove and Dr. Maric) have
 commented that Kidwell's objective and subjective symptoms don't
 match, with Dr. Maric going further to state that her complaints
 aren't related to any medical issue, and that the pain she
 reports is not related to the L4-5 disc. 
While there is evidence to support both parties'
 
conclusions regarding the degree of disability, it is not the
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
duty of this court to re-weigh the evidence. Igawa, 97 Hawai 'i 
at 405-06, 38 P.3d at 573-74. "In a worker's compensation case, 
the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." Yadao v. State, Dept. of Land & Nat. Res., 137 Hawai
'i 162, 172, 366 P.3d 1041, 
1051 (App. 2016) (quoting Tamashiro v. Control Specialists, Inc., 97 Hawai
'i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001)). "The Board is not 
mandated to reconcile conflicting expert testimony in favor of the claimant, because doing so would 'eviscerate the well-established rule that the Board's determination of credibility and weight are entitled to deference.'" Nobunaga v. State, 
Judiciary Dept., No. CAAPâ11â0000375, 2014 WL 1271025 at *12 (Haw. App. Mar. 28, 2014) (quoting Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai
'i 
263, 270, 47 P.3d 730, 737 (2002)). 
The most meaningful disagreement among the doctors is
 
the amount of disability. Drs. Maxwell and Maric both opined
 that there was zero basis for Kidwell to be restricted from work
 and she had a zero percent impairment rating, and Dr. Maric
 concluded that Kidwell suffered a back strain or sprain and
 required no further treatment; Dr. Francis, as a consulting
 surgeon, did not comment on disability; and Dr. Grove has
 maintained since Kidwell came into his care that she is unable to
 work, and is currently permanently and totally disabled. Based
 on the testimonies of Drs. Maxwell and Maric, the Board found
 that the proposed medical treatments and any temporary total
 disability were not the result of Kidwell's September 2006 Work
 Injury.
 
Nobunaga is instructive. Claimant's doctors there
 
opined that his treatment while under Employer's supervision did
 not cause an aggravation of a pre-existing condition. Nobunaga,
 
2014 WL 1271025 at *5. Employer's doctors contended that
 Claimant suffered a recurrence of the symptoms, irrespective of
 his employment duties, rather than an aggravation of his
 condition. Id. at *6. This court found that, while there was
 
evidence to support both conclusions, the Board ultimately had
 the best perspective to judge credibility of witnesses and decide
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
which doctors to credit, and affirmed the Board's assessment of
 
the witness testimony and evidence. Id. at *12. 
Dr. Maxwell and Dr. Maric's assessment of Kidwell's
 
condition was based on reasoned consideration and medical
 examination, and differed from Dr. Grove's primarily in the
 percentage of disability. Each doctor agreed on the condition of
 Kidwell's spine. While there was disagreement in the result of
 that condition, Kidwell provides this court with no compelling
 rationale nor citation to substantiate a firm conviction that a
 mistake has been made. 
The Board may weigh and judge the credibility of the
 
witnesses and evidence as the trier of fact. Nobunaga, 2014 WL
 
1271025 at *12. The Board was, therefore, not clearly erroneous
 in finding that the proposed medical treatments and any temporary
 total disability were not the result of Kidwell's work injury. 
Accordingly, FOF 18, 26, 44, and 47 are not clearly erroneous,
 and points of error (1) through (4) are without merit.
 
B.	 The Board did not err when it denied the treatment
 
plans submitted by Dr. Grove. 
Dr. Grove submitted three treatment plans, the
 
October 22, 2008 Plan, the November 7, 2008 Plan, and the
 
December 31, 2008 Plan. Employer denied all three plans.
 Kidwell challenges FOF 48 and COL 1, which presents a mixed
 question of fact and law, and argues that the Board's denial of
 the treatment plans was based on the Board's erroneous decision
 to credit the testimony of Drs. Maric, Francis, and Maxwell over
 that of Dr. Grove. This issue is addressed above with regard to
 points of error (1) through (4). 
In addition, Kidwell cites to Bell Brothers Heating and
 
Air Conditioning v. Gwinn, 779 N.W.2d 193 (Iowa 2010), and urges
 us to adopt a "retrospective test" to determine whether medical
 care was reasonable. However, there is sufficient evidence upon
 which the Board relied in concluding that the treatment plans
 were not medically necessary. In FOF 48 and COL 1, the Board
 explicitly found that the treatment plans submitted by Dr. Grove
 are not medically necessary as a result of the September 2006
 Work Injury. This conclusion is supported by Dr. Maric's
 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
assessment that no further treatment is required to address any
 
physical issue with Kidwell's spine. Accordingly the plans
 submitted by Dr. Grove are not medically reasonable or necessary
 as a result of the September 2006 Work Injury, irrespective of
 whether they are necessary generally. Accordingly, FOF 48 and
 COL 1 are not clearly erroneous, and points of error (5) and (6)
 are without merit.
 
C.	 The Board did not err in affirming the end of TTD
payments after December 12, 2008. 
Kidwell argues that the Board erred in affirming the 
end of TTD payments on December 12, 2008. Point of error (7) 
relates to FOF 49, and point of error (8) relates to COL 2, which presents a mixed question of fact and law. Accordingly, both are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i 
at 405-06, 38 P.3d at 573-74. 
Kidwell's argument rests on the premise that the Board
 
erred in crediting the opinions of Drs. Maxwell, Maric, and
 Francis, and essentially restates her arguments regarding points
 of error (1) through (4). As Kidwell has failed to make
 arguments that do not rely on crediting Dr. Grove's opinions over
 all other doctors, these points of error are addressed entirely
 above. Accordingly, FOF 49 and COL 2 are not clearly erroneous,
 and points of error (7) and (8) are without merit. 
D.	 The Board did not err in affirming the Director's end
date of the TTD period. 
Kidwell reiterates her challenge to FOF 48 and claims
 
that the Board erred in ruling the end of the TTD period to be
 
December 12, 2008 when the compensability of her falls which
 occurred after her 2009 surgeries had not yet been adjudicated.
1/
 
The Board did not, however, address Kidwell's March 16, 2011
 second claim and neither do we. The Board, therefore, did not
 err in addressing the end date of the TTD period on the basis of
 the claim and evidence before it. Accordingly, point of error
 
1/
 Claims for falls and injuries occurring on March 31, 2009,
February 6, 2010, and February 11, 2011 were made on March 21, 2011.

(9) is without merit.
