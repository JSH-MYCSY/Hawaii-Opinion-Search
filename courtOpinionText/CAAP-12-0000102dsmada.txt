ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF/APPELLEE/CROSS-APPELLANT
RAYMOND GURROBAT'S MAY 7, 2012 MOTION TO DISMISS
APPEAL NO. CAAP-12-0000102 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellant
 
Raymond Gurrobat's (Appellant Gurrobat) May 7, 2012 motion to
 
dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000102 for lack of jurisdiction, 
(2) the lack of any opposition thereto, and (3) the record, it
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appears that the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's January 18, 2012 
judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) 
(1993 & Supp. 2011), Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994), and, thus, we lack jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-12­0000102. 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held 
that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) 
must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
Although Appellant Gurrobat's second amended complaint
 
asserted multiple causes of action against Defendants/Appellants/
 Cross-Appellees HTH Corporation (Appellant HTH Corporation) and
 Pacific Beach Corporation, LLC, dba Pacific Beach Hotel
 (Appellant Pacific Beach Corporation), pursuant to HRS § 480-2
 (2008), HRS § 481B-14 (2008) and HRS § 388-6 (1993), the
 January 18, 2012 judgment does not specifically identify the
 cause of action or causes of action on which the circuit court
 intends to enter judgment in favor of Appellant Gurrobat and
 against Appellee HTH Corporation and Appellee Pacific Beach
 Corporation. Therefore, the January 18, 2012 judgment does not
 satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment under HRS
 § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an
 appealable judgment, the appeal and cross-appeal in Appeal No.
 CAAP-12-0000102 are premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000102.

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant
 
Gurrobat's May 7, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12­
0000102 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and the appeal and
 cross-appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000102 are dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
