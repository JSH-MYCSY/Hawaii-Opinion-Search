NO. CAAP-12-0000106
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DANIEL S. NAKANO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-02743)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Defendant-Appellant Daniel S. Nakano's
 
timely April 27, 2013 motion for reconsideration of the April 26,
 
2013 summary disposition order of the court, it appears that
 
Nakano argues, relying on State v. Grindles, 70 Haw. 528, 77 P.2d
 
1187 (1989), a due process violation in permitting the State to
 
prosecute the Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 
Intoxicant (OVUII) offense under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3)
 
(breath/blood measurement), because the State agreed to his plea
 
to OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (impairment) and thus chose
 
not to proceed under (a)(3).
 
Grindles is inapposite, where it concerned violations
 
of due process and the right against self-incrimination by the
 
district court's requiring the defendant to testify (as to one
 
1
method of DUI)  before conclusion of the State's evidence (on
1
 Driving Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, the precedessor
charge to OVUII.

another method of DUI) in a bifurcated trial. In the instant
 
case, where no effective (a)(1) charge existed because of a lack
 
of alleged mens rea, Nakano was not placed in jeopardy by that
 
defective charge.2 Additionally, the record does not reflect
 
that the State or the district court understood that Nakano was
 
pleading only to (a)(1), where no confirmation of such by the
 
State occurred, and where the district court inquired if Nakano
 
3
was pleading "as charged,"  to which Nakano's counsel answered in
the affirmative, and then the district court proceeded to convict
 
Nakano under (a)(3) in addition to (a)(1). Thus, the State's
 
right to proceed to trial notwithstanding the plea does not
 
prejudice Nakano's right to due process. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant-Appellant's 
April 27, 2013 motion for reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 7, 2013.

2 The prevailing rule regarding invalid
indictments enunciated by the United States Supreme
Court is that such an indictment “is no bar to a
 
prosecution upon a good one.” United States v.
 Oppenheimer, 242 U.S. 85, 87, 37 S.Ct. 68, 69, 61
 L.Ed. 161 (1916); United States v. Kimbrew, supra [380
F.2d 538 (6th Cir. 1967)]. “If . . . (the indictment)
is not sufficient, then jeopardy does not attach upon
the swearing of the jury. (Citations omitted).” United
 States v. LeMay, supra, [330 F.Supp. 628 (D. Mont.
1971)] at 630; The Queen v. Poor, 9 Haw. 295 (1893).
 
State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 364, 374, 616 P.2d 193, 199-200 (1980).
