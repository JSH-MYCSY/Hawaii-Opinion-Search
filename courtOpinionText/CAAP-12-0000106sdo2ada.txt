STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DANIEL S. NAKANO, Defendant-Appellant

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

HONOLULU DIVISION

(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-02743)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER1

(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Daniel S. Nakano (Nakano) appeals

from the January 23, 2012 Judgment entered by the District Court

of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division(District Court).2

Nakano was charged with Operating a Vehicle Under the

Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii

Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (2007)

arising from an incident occurring on June 10, 2011. Nakano

entered a conditional change of plea to no contest as to

HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), stipulating to a factual basis, and

reserving for appeal the issue raised herein. Nakano did not

enter a plea to HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). The District Court accepted
 
Nakano's no contest plea on HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), and entered a

judgment of conviction on subsections HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), (a)(3)

and/or (b)(1).

The change-of-plea colloquy appears to indicate that the District
Court believed that Nakano was entering a plea to the "original charge."

On appeal, Nakano, in his opening brief, does not

contest the conviction as to HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), but contends

that the District Court erred in failing to grant his oral motion

to dismiss the complaint for OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)

because it did not allege a state of mind. Nakano sought "that
 
the case be dismiss[ed] by the District Court for lack of

jurisdiction because the Complaint fails to state a proper

charge." 
 
' Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii (State) argues that 
Nakano should be permitted to withdraw his plea as to 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), but that the conviction under HRS § 291e­
61(a)(3) should be affirmed. 
In his reply brief, Nakano disagrees with the State

that his conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) could be affirmed,

arguing that he did not plead to that subsection, that there is

no reason to address the (a)(3) charge, and that the entire

complaint should be dismissed without prejudice.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we

resolve Nakano's point of error as follows.

Based on the Hawai' i Supreme Court's decision in State 
v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 61, 276 P.3d 617, 630 (2012), we 
conclude that the complaint was sufficient to charge OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), but was insufficient to charge OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Thus, no effective charge against Nakano under HRS § 291e-61(a)(1) existed, but the State was entitled to proceed to trial on the OVUII offense charged under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). However, where no trial ensued on the (a)(3) offense, and where Nakano neither entered a no contest plea nor stipulated to a factual basis for the OVUII charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), no proof has yet been adduced to support a conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), and said conviction cannot be sustained. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment filed on

January 23, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit is

vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court for
