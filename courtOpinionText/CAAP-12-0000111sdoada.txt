NO. CAAP-12-0000111
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
KAMALEI K. COZO, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
DEREK HALL, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
PUNA DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 3SS11-1-299)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Derek Hall (Hall), pro se, appeals
 
from the Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against
 
Harassment, entered on January 23, 2012 in the District Court of
 
the Third Circuit, Puna Division (District Court).1
 
On appeal, Hall contends (1) there was not clear and
 
convincing evidence of harassment because the evidence presented
 
varied from the allegations in the petition for temporary
 
restraining order (TRO) and (2) offers of proof regarding
 
separate shotgun and shovel incidents were ignored by the
 
District Court and.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Hall's points of error as follows:

(1) Hall contends that there was no clear and
 
convincing evidence to support issuance of an Injunction Against
 
Harassment. Hall specifically notes discrepancies between the
 
allegations in Petitioner-Appellee Kamalei K. Cozo's (Cozo) TRO
 
application and the evidence presented by witnesses at the
 
hearing. Hall points out that although Cozo alleged that he
 
threatened to put holes in Cozo with a shotgun, there was no
 
evidence that Hall possessed a shotgun.
 
The District Court did not base its decision to grant
 
an injunction against harassment upon Hall's possession of a
 
shotgun. Rather, the District Court found that Hall had
 
threatened to put holes in Cozo on more than one instance and
 
Hall admitted that he tapped Cozo on the head with a shovel. 
There was clear and convincing evidence that Hall committed
 
Harassment, as defined in HRS § 604-10.5(a) (Supp. 2010). 
Therefore, the District Court did not err by issuing an Order
 
Granting Petition for Injunction Against Harassment.
 
(2) Hall contends that the District Court refused his
 
offer of proof, i.e. photographs of his property, he was not
 
allowed to approach the bench, and his testimony was ignored. 
Hall contends that his "substantial rights are being affected as
 
I am not being allowed to present evidence to show the court the
 
measures I have had to take to protect my property from repeated
 
intrusions by Mr. Cozo."
 
Hall confuses an offer of proof with a request to admit
 
his photographs into evidence. Hall requested to approach the
 
bench with some pictures. The trial transcript does not indicate
 
whether the District Court reviewed the photographs, only that
 
Hall was asked whether he had copies for Cozo, to which he
 
responded in the negative. Hall indicated that the pictures were
 
"of various circumstances -- I mean various situations at my
 
house and the extraordinary measures I’ve had to take to keep
 
[Cozo] out." Hall did not lay the proper foundation to admit the
 
photographs into evidence. Moreover, the physical
 
characteristics of Hall's property was not at issue. Thus, the

photographs were also not relevant to rebutting Cozo's
 
description of two incidents that occurred between Cozo and Hall
 
which Cozo contended constituted Harassment, as defined in HRS
 
§ 604-10.5. Therefore, the District Court did not err by
 
refusing to admit and consider Hall's photographs.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Granting Petition
 
for Injunction Against Harassment, entered on January 23, 2012 in
 the District Court of the Third Circuit, Puna Division is
 
affirmed.
