STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FERDINAND MALINAY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 05-1-0101)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ferdinand Malinay (Malinay) appeals
 
from the February 10, 2012 Amended Judgment entered by the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),  convicting
him of the included offense of Assault in the 
First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 707-710 (1993) (Count I) and Assault Against a Law Enforcement
 
Officer in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-712.5
 
(Supp. 2012) (Count II).
 
On appeal, Malinay contends that the Circuit court
 
erred in convicting him because evidence of Malinay's state of

mind relating to his conduct in each offense  was insufficient in

 Malinay argues that insufficient evidence of his state of mind for
the conduct element of the two offenses was presented. Malinay does not
contest that serious bodily injury in Count I or bodily injury in Count II,
occurred.

light of evidence reflecting that Malinay suffered from a major
 
mental illness aggravated by alcohol abuse that day.3
 
Based on a careful review of the point on appeal, the
 
arguments made, the record, and the applicable authority, we
 
conclude, from the stipulated reports of the mental health
 
examiners and from the witness statements contained in the police
 
reports stipulated into evidence, that (1) there was substantial
 
evidence that Malinay intentionally and knowingly caused serious
 
bodily injury in Count I and bodily injury in Count II, and
 
(2) the affirmative defense that Malinay's conduct stemmed from a 
mental disease, disorder, or defect excluding responsibility was 
not supported by a preponderance of the evidence presented.

Therefore, the February 10, 2012 Amended Judgment of 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
