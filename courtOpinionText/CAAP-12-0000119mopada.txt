MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D. (Jou)
 
appeals from "Defendant K. Kenneth Siu's Second Judgment Against
 
Plaintiff Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D.," entered on February 3, 2012 in
 
1
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court) in favor
of Defendant-Appellee K. Kenneth Siu (Siu).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November 25, 2009, Jou filed a complaint (Complaint)
 
against Siu, alleging Siu had made false representations and had
 
induced Jou into entering into an agreement to lease a dwelling

 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided over this matter until
November 2, 2011. The matter was reassigned to the Honorable Karen T.
Nakasone effective November 2, 2011.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unit to Siu. On April 21, 2010, Siu filed a motion to dismiss
 
the Complaint and for attorney's fees pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 607-14 (Supp. 2012).
 
On June 15, 2010, Jou filed an opposition to Siu's
 
motion to dismiss. On the same day, Jou filed a first amended
 
complaint (FAC) purporting to assert a cause of action based on
 
Siu's false representations, plus claims for conversion,
 
negligence, and violations of HRS § 663-1 (Supp. 2012).
 
On July 19, 2010, the parties participated in a
 
settlement conference and placed a conditional settlement on the
 
record. The settlement was contingent upon Siu's provision of
 
certain financial disclosure statements (specifically, the asset
 
and debt statements and income and expense statements Siu had
 
filed in the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court)). 
Siu would then pay two thousand dollars to Jou in exchange for a
 
release and indemnification, and the parties would stipulate to a
 
dismissal of Jou's Complaint.
 
On July 30, 2010, Jou filed a motion to set aside the
 
settlement and for attorney's fees and costs. Jou contended the
 
settlement should be set aside because Siu had failed to provide
 
his asset and debt statements and had concealed assets. The
 
circuit court held a hearing on the motion on August 3, 2010. At
 
the hearing, the circuit court set aside the contingent
 
settlement agreement and dismissed Jou's FAC, noting the FAC
 
failed to correct deficiencies in the original Complaint.
 
Jou filed a motion for reconsideration on August 11,
 
2010, which the circuit court granted in part. The court
 
reconsidered its dismissal of the FAC because Siu had filed a
 
motion to dismiss the original Complaint but not the FAC. On
 
December 23, 2010, the circuit court entered an order dismissing
 
the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a
 
claim, and the court awarded attorney's fees to Siu.
 
On January 6, 2011, Jou filed a motion for leave to
 
file a second amended complaint (SAC). On September 8, 2011, the
 
circuit court decided the motion in part, permitting Jou to
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assert a single claim for breach of the lease agreement. The
 
court denied the remaining claims (discussed below) as being
 
futile.
 
Jou filed his SAC on September 27, 2011. On October 
19, 2011, Siu moved to dismiss the SAC pursuant to Hawaif i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). On November 10, 2011, Jou filed a motion for summary judgment, 
partial summary judgment, or an HRCP 56(d) order (November 10, 
2011 MSJ). At the hearing on both parties' motions, held on 
December 7, 2011, the circuit court granted Siu's motion for 
dismissal, concluding the SAC was not well-pled and failed to 
state a cognizable claim. The court also concluded it lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction because the SAC failed to establish 
that Jou's claim for damages exceeded the minimum jurisdictional 
amount pursuant to HRS § 604-5 (Supp. 2012).
2 
On February 3, 2012, the circuit court entered
 
"Defendant K. Kenneth Siu's Second Judgment Against Plaintiff
 
Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D.," entering final judgment in favor of Siu
 
and against Jou and dismissing all claims in Jou's Complaint,
 
FAC, and SAC. Jou filed a timely notice of appeal on February
 
27, 2012.
 
2 HRS § 604-5 states in relevant part:
 
§604-5 Civil jurisdiction.  (a) Except as otherwise
provided, the district courts shall have jurisdiction in all civil
actions where the debt, amount, damages, or value of the property
claimed does not exceed $25,000, except in civil actions involving
summary possession or ejectment, in which case the district court
shall have jurisdiction over any counterclaim otherwise properly
brought by any defendant in the action if the counterclaim arises
out of and refers to the land or premises the possession of which
is being sought, regardless of the value of the debt, amount,
damages, or property claim contained in the counterclaim.
Attorney's commissions or fees, including those stipulated in any
note or contract sued on, interest, and costs, shall not be
included in computing the jurisdictional amount. Subject to
subsections (b) and (c), jurisdiction under this subsection shall
be exclusive when the amount in controversy, so computed, does not
exceed $10,000.
 
HRS § 604-5(a) (emphasis added).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jou raises several points on appeal, generally
 
contending the circuit court erred in:
 
(1) dismissing Jou's original Complaint and awarding
 
attorney's fees to Siu;
 
(2) denying in part Jou's motion for leave to file his 
SAC; 
(3) dismissing the SAC and awarding attorney's fees to 
Siu; and 
(4) denying Jou's November 10, 2011 MSJ on the SAC.3 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Motion to Amend Answer 
"[T]he grant or denial of leave to amend under [HRCP] 
Rule 15(a) is within the discretion of the trial court." 
Associated Eng'rs & Contractors, Inc. v. State
, 58 Haw. 187, 218,
 
567 P.2d 397, 417 (1977).
 B. Motion to Dismiss
 
A circuit court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is
reviewed de novo. Wright v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 111
Hawaifi 401, 406, 142 P.3d 265, 270 (2006). 
A complaint should not be dismissed for failure
to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of
his or her claim that would entitle him or her to
 relief. [The appellate court] must therefore view a
plaintiff's complaint in a light most favorable to him
or her in order to determine whether the allegations
contained therein could warrant relief under any
alternative theory. For this reason, in reviewing [a]
circuit court's order dismissing [a] complaint . . .
[the appellate court's] consideration is strictly
limited to the allegations of the complaint, and [the
appellate court] must deem those allegations to be
true.

1190, 1195-96 (2003) (citations omitted) (some brackets andellipsis in original) (some brackets added).

 Jou failed to provide a discernable argument with regard to his
second point of error, in which he contended the circuit court erred indenying in part his August 11, 2010 motion for reconsideration. Therefore, wedeem Jou's second point of error waived. Hawaif i Rules of Appellate Procedure
Rule 28(b)(7); Int'l Sav. and Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawaif i 464,
473, 5 P.3d 454, 463 (App. 2000) ("An appellate court need not address mattersas to which the appellant has failed to present a discernible argument.").

Cnty. of Kauaf i v. Baptiste, 115 Hawaif i 15, 24, 165 P.3d 916, 926 
(2007). 
C. Attorney's Fees
 
"The trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees 
and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 120 Hawaif i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1242 (2009) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Dismissal of Complaint and Award of Attorney's Fees
 We agree with Jou's contention that the circuit court 
erred in dismissing his original Complaint and in granting Siu's April 21, 2010 request for attorney's fees under HRS § 607-14.
4 
Jou filed his FAC as a matter of course, as permitted under HRCP Rule 15(a)(1). An amended complaint supersedes the original 
complaint and renders the original complaint of no legal effect. 
Beneficial Hawaif i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawaif i 159, 167, 45 P.3d 
359, 367 (2002). Therefore, Siu's motion to dismiss the original Complaint was moot, and the circuit court erred in granting the 
motion to dismiss. The circuit court also erred in granting 
Siu's request for attorney's fees when it dismissed the original 
complaint because Siu was not the prevailing party of the 
proceeding at that point. See HRS § 607-14. 
B. Denial of Proposed Amendments in Jou's SAC
 Jou contends the circuit court erred in denying Jou's
 
request to state seven tort claims in his SAC. In his proposed
 SAC, Jou sought to assert a claim for "fraudulent inducement of
 
lease;" three claims for fraud based on Siu's alleged wrongful
 
subletting, retention of subtenant deposits, and payment through
 
a check drawn on insufficient funds; and claims for conversion,
 
4
 A motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading with the meaning
of the rule. Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 60, 451 P.2d 814, 824 (1969). 
5
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
negligence, and violations of HRS § 663-1.5 The circuit court
 
concluded Jou's proposed amendment of the Complaint to add these
 
claims would be futile. 
HRCP Rule 15(a), which governed Jou's request to amend 
his Complaint, states: "[A] party may amend the party's pleading 
only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse 
party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires." 
A court may deny a motion for leave to amend a pleading if the 
amendment appears futile. Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 
110 Hawaif i 338, 365, 133 P.3d 767, 794 (2006). An amendment to 
a pleading is futile if the proposed claim could not withstand a 
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Id. 
Siu's motion opposing Jou's motion for leave to amend
 
argued Jou's additional claims were futile pursuant to HRS § 663­
1.2 (Supp. 2012). HRS § 663-1.2 states: "No person may recover 
damages, including punitive damages, in tort for a breach of a 
contract in the absence of conduct that: (1) Violated a duty that 
is independently recognized by principles of tort law; and (2) 
Transcended the breach of the contract." Thus, as a general 
rule, a breach of contract does not give rise to a tort action. 
See Francis v. Lee Enterprises, Inc., 89 Hawaif i 234, 971 P.2d 
707 (1999). Siu argued the seven tort claims were indistinguishable from Jou's contract claim for breach of the 
lease agreement, and HRS § 663-1.2 required dismissal of the tort 
claims. 
Fraud and fraudulent inducement, however, are contract-
related torts for which tort recovery may be available. In
 
5
 HRS § 663-1 states:
 
§663-1 Torts, who may sue and for what. Except as otherwise
provided, all persons residing or being in the State shall be
personally responsible in damages, for trespass or injury, whether
direct or consequential, to the person or property of others, or
to their spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, children under
majority, or wards, by such offending party, or the offending
party's child under majority, or by the offending party's command,
or by the offending party's animals, domestic or wild; and the
party aggrieved may prosecute therefor in the proper courts.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Francis,  89 Hawaif i at 242, 971 P.2d at 715, the Hawaif i Supreme 
Court stated: "[T]he existence of a contract will not defeat 
otherwise valid claims for relief sounding in tort, such as 
fraud, where punitive damages are allowed in order to vindicate 
social policy." See also TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 
Hawai
fi 243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 734 (1999) (concluding 
plaintiff's complaint, which included a claim for fraudulent 
inducement to enter into contract, sounded in tort rather than in 
contract for the purposes of the attorney's fees statute). 
Therefore, a claim for fraud, if properly stated, would not be 
futile or barred by HRS § 663-1.2. 
HRCP Rule 9(b) provides: "In all averments of 
fraud . . . the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall 
be stated with particularity." "The rule is designed, in part, 
to insure the particularized information necessary for a 
defendant to prepare an effective defense to a claim which 
embraces a wide variety of potential conduct." Larsen v. 
Pacesetter Sys., Inc., 74 Haw. 1, 30, 837 P.2d 1273, 1288 (1992). See also Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc.,
 622 F.3d 
1035, 1042 (9th Cir. 2010) (stating plaintiff "must allege the time, place, and content of the fraudulent representation; 
conclusory allegations do not suffice."). A party claiming 
fraudulent inducement must establish that "(1) false 
representations were made by defendants, (2) with knowledge of 
their falsity (or without knowledge of their truth or falsity), 
(3) in contemplation of plaintiff's reliance upon these false 
representations, and (4) plaintiff did rely upon them." TSA 
Int'l, Ltd.
, 92 Hawaif i at 255, 990 P.2d at 725. 
The original Complaint and the FAC contained conclusory
 
allegations that Siu had made false representations, intending to
 induce Jou into leasing a dwelling unit and did not expressly
 
allege fraud. Therefore, the Complaint and FAC failed to give
 
Siu fair notice of a fraud claim with sufficient particularity to
 
satisfy the requirements of HRCP Rule 9(b). See Larsen, 74 Haw.
 
at 31, 837 P.2d at 1289. The proposed SAC, however, expressly
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stated a claim for "fraudulent inducement of lease," requested
 
general, special, and punitive damages, and added the following
 
relevant allegations:
 
4. Prior to February 8, 2008, . . . [Siu] orally and
repeatedly represented to [Jou] the material fact that he
was a physician able to afford the lease[.]
 
5. These false representations, made by [Siu] before the
lease was signed, were made with intent to induce [Jou] to
act; i.e.[,] to lease to [Siu] his residence at 65 Old PaliPlace, Honolulu, Hawaif i 96817. 
6. 
When [Siu] made these representations, as aforesaid, he
knew at the time that the representations were made that
they were false, . . . in that [Siu's] medical license had
been revoked on or about September 8, 2006.
 
. . . .
 
9.
 [Jou] relied on these false representations and each of
them; and did in fact allow Defendant to occupy the
property.
 
The above allegations are distinct from those giving 
rise to Jou's breach of contract claim and are stated with 
sufficient particularity under the standards of HRCP Rule 9(b). 
Furthermore, Jou may pursue multiple or alternative remedies 
during the course of trial (although, to the extent Jou's damages 
were the same for his fraudulent inducement and breach of 
contract claims, he cannot recover on both theories). Exotics 
Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawaif i 
277, 291, 172 P.3d 1021, 1035 (2007). Consequently, Jou's 
proposed amendment was not futile, and the circuit court abused 
its discretion in failing to allow the amendment to assert a 
claim for fraudulent inducement. 
The circuit court did not err, however, when it 
concluded Jou's fraud claims for "fraudulent subletting," "fraud­
retention of subtenant deposit," and "fraud-check drawn on 
insufficient funds" were futile. "Fraud cannot be predicated on 
statements which are promissory in their nature, or constitute 
expressions of intention, and an actionable representation cannot 
consist of mere broken promises[.]" TSA Int'l, Ltd., 92 Hawaif i 
at 255, 990 P.2d at 725 (quoting Stahl v. Balsara, 60 Haw. 144, 149, 587 P2d 1210, 1214 (1978)). The alleged false 
8
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
representation must relate to a past or existing material fact
 
and not the occurrence of a future event. Id.
 
Jou based the three fraud claims solely on allegations
 
of Siu's promises to perform future acts. The "fraudulent
 
subletting" and "fraud-retention of subtenant deposit" claims
 
were based on Siu's promise to sublet the unit, pass all rent
 
from the subtenants to Jou, and refund the subtenants' deposits. 
The claim for "fraud-check drawn on insufficient funds" was based
 
on Siu's promise to "send[] a check for a payment of the November
 
2008[] rent owed to [Jou]." Because the three causes of action
 
were based solely on Siu's alleged failure to perform promised
 
future acts, the circuit court did not err when it concluded the
 
proposed amendments failed to state a claim for fraud.
 
The circuit court also did not err when it concluded
 
that Jou's claims for conversion, negligence, and violations of
 
HRS § 663-1 were futile. The three claims were predicated on the
 
same set of facts as Jou's contract claim for breach of the lease
 
agreement, and the SAC failed to allege a breach of any duty
 
separate and distinct from Siu's contractual obligations under
 
the lease agreement. Pursuant to HRS § 663-1.2, Jou's remedy for
 
these allegations lie solely in his action on the contract, and
 
the circuit court properly denied these claims as futile. 
C. Dismissal of The SAC and Award of Attorney's Fees
 
The circuit court dismissed the SAC for failure to
 
state a claim for breach of contract, concluding the SAC was not
 well-pled and was ambiguous. We disagree and conclude the
 
circuit court erred in dismissing the SAC. 
HRCP Rule 8(a)(1) sets for the requirements for
 
pleading a claim and calls for "a short and plain statement of
 
the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]" We
 
conclude the SAC satisfied this standard. The SAC stated, in
 
relevant part:
 
4. On or about February 8, 2008, Defendant Siu and
Plaintiff Emerson M.F. Jou entered into a fixed written 
lease, ending February 28, 2009. Under the terms of the agreement Plaintiff leased to Defendant a residentialproperty at 65 Old Pali Place, Honolulu, Hawaif i 96817. A 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
copy of the lease is attached as Exhibit A.4 and A.5 and is
made a part hereof.
 
5. Plaintiff has performed all conditions, covenants, and
promises required of the lessor to be performed under the
terms and conditions of the lease.
 
. . . .
 
7.
 Defendant has breached his obligations under the lease by
failure to pay $2,300.00 per month by the first day of each
month, as agreed at Exhibit "A.4", paragraph 6.
 
8. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach of
his obligations under the lease, Plaintiff has suffered
expenses, losses and damages[.]
 
Such allegations suffice to put the defendant on notice as to the 
nature of Jou's claim for breach of the lease contract and, 
taking the allegations as true and in the light most favorable to 
the plaintiff, Baptiste, 115 Hawaif i at 24, 165 P.3d at 925, 
would entitle Jou to relief. 
The circuit court also erred to the extent it dismissed
 
the SAC for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. At the hearing
 on Siu's motion to dismiss the SAC, the circuit court concluded
 
it lacked jurisdiction because the SAC failed to establish that
 
Jou's claim for damages exceeded the minimum jurisdictional
 
amount for civil jurisdiction in the circuit court, pursuant to
 
HRS § 604-5. Pursuant to HRS § 604-5, the district courts have
 
exclusive jurisdiction in civil actions in which the amount in
 
controversy does not exceed $10,000, and the district courts and
 
circuit courts have concurrent jurisdiction when the amount in
 
controversy exceeds $10,000 but does not exceed $25,000. Here,
 
the SAC expressly requested damages in excess of $10,000. 
Because we must deem these allegations to be true, we conclude
 
the SAC was within the concurrent jurisdiction of the circuit
 
courts and the district courts and not within the exclusive
 
jurisdiction of the district courts. 
Therefore, the circuit court erred in dismissing the
 
SAC for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject-matter
 
jurisdiction. Because the dismissal was erroneous, the court 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
also erred in granting Siu's request for attorney's fees pursuant
 
to HRS § 607-14.
 
D. Denial of The November 10, 2011 MSJ 
Jou contends he is entitled to summary judgment on his 
SAC. Jou relies on the asset and debt statements Siu had filed 
in the Family Court, in which Siu noted a debt for $12,125.41
 
owed to Jou. Jou argues the statements should be deemed an
 
admission by Siu.
 
The record, however, contains conflicting evidence
 
sufficient to preclude summary judgment. The entry for the
 
$12,125.41 debt to Jou referred to a document attached to the
 
asset and debt statements. The document stated Siu "may owe his
 
prior landlord for back rent." (Emphasis added.) Thus, the
 
asset and debt statements do not amount to an admission, and
 
genuine issues of material fact remain to be resolved on remand.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We vacate the February 3, 2012 "Defendant K. Kenneth
 
Siu's Second Judgment Against Plaintiff Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D."
 
entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit and remand this
 
case for further proceedings.
