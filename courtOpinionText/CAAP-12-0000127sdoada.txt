APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-2051)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kaleookalani K. Kekaualua, also
 
known as Kurt K. Kekaualua and Aunty Kaleo ("Kekaualua"), appeals
 
from the February 1, 2012 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
 Court").
1
 
On appeal, Kekaualua argues that: (1) he was denied his
 
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel when his
 trial counsel (a) failed to object to hearsay evidence
 establishing identification and (b) moved into evidence the
 report authored by Honolulu Police Department ("HPD") Officer
 Khan Le; and (2) the deputy prosecutor engaged in misconduct when
 
1
 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
she made statements regarding Officer Le's integrity during
 
closing arguments.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kekaualua's points as follows:
 
(1) Kekaualua argues that his trial counsel was
 
ineffective because counsel did not object to hearsay statements
 made by HPD Officer Chad Tanaka, and moved Officer Le's follow-up
 report regarding a photographic lineup into evidence.
2
 
a. Officer Tanaka's Hearsay Testimony
 
Kekaualua contends that his counsel's "fail[ure] to 
object to . . . hearsay statements establishing [Kekaualua] as the person who sold drugs to Officer Le" impaired his defense, in which he sought to show that Officer Le had mistakenly identified Kekaualua as the seller. He focuses on two statements made during the prosecutor's direct examination of Officer Tanaka: (a) "[Officer Le] said he conducted a transaction with a male known as Kaleo[,]" and (b) "I conducted a photographic lineup with Officer Le, at which time he pointed out the defendant as the same male with whom he purchased drugs from." Kekaualua argues that because these hearsay statements served to bolster Officer Le's later testimony, and that no other witness testified as to the seller's identity, counsel's performance was deficient for failing to have them excluded under Hawai
'i Rules of Evidence 
("HRE") Rule 801.3 
2
 Kekaualua further argues in his reply brief that trial counsel's
failure to object to the deputy prosecutor's closing argument "should also be
considered as part of trial counsel's performance as a whole when determining
the merits of [Kekaualua's] ineffective assistance of counsel claim." Because
 this argument was not raised in Kekaualua's opening brief, however, we deem it
waived. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7).
 
3
 HRE Rule 801 provides, in relevant part:
 
"Hearsay" is a statement, other than one made by the
declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered
in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
 
"Statement" is an oral assertion, an assertion in a
writing, or nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended
by the person as an assertion.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
For Kekaualua to prevail, he must establish, in part,
 
"specific errors or omissions of defense counsel reflecting
 
counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence." State v.
 
Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980) (citing State
 v. Kahalewai, 54 Haw. 28, 30, 501 P.2d 977, 979 (1972)). 
Kekaualua fails, however, to identify any error, as Officer
 Tanaka's two unchallenged statements, while hearsay, were exempt
 as prior identification from the rule against hearsay under HRE
 Rule 802.1(3).
4
   
"A police officer may testify as to the prior 
identification by a witness, but only where the person making the identification 'is present at trial, testifies to the prior identification, and is subject to cross-examination.'"  State v. 
Tafokitau, 104 Hawai
'i 285, 290, 88 P.3d 657, 662 (App. 2004) 
(quoting State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980)). Similarly, if these conditions are satisfied, an "officer who conducted [a] photographic lineup may also testify to such identification[.]" Naeole, 62 Haw. at 570, 617 P.2d at 
826. Here, the hearsay declarant, Officer Le, testified at trial
 as to each of his identifications of Kekaualua to Officer Tanaka
 and was, thereafter, subject to cross-examination. Thus, Officer
 Tanaka's statements about Officer Le's prior identification were
 admissible under HRE Rule 802.1(3), and defense counsel did not
 demonstrate a "lack of skill, judgment, or diligence" in not
 objecting to the statements. 
Haw. R. Evid. 801 (Supp. 2013).

 HRE 802.1 provides, in relevant part:
 
The following statements previously made by witnesses
who testify at the trial or hearing are not excluded by the
hearsay rule:
 
. . . .
 
(3)	 Prior identification. The declarant is subject
to cross-examination concerning the subject
matter of the declarant's statement, and the
statement is one of identification of a person
made after perceiving that person[.]
 
Haw. R. Evid. 802.1 (1993).

b. Officer Le's Follow-up Report
 
Kekaualua argues that his trial counsel was also
 
ineffective because counsel moved Officer Le's follow-up report
 
into evidence after Officer Le admitted that, in the original
 report, he had indicated the wrong photograph. Officer Le
 testified that although he indicated, in the report, that he had
 selected photograph number three, he had circled photograph
 number four, Kekaualua's photograph on the actual photographic
 lineup.
 
Kekaualua contends that "[m]oving the [follow-up]
 
report into evidence alone might not have been too bad, but this
 line of questioning led the deputy prosecutor to move the
 photographic lineup into evidence on re-direct examination." He
 contends that these actions "further cemented the identity of the
 seller as [Kekaualua] . . . [and] further demonstrated defense[]
 counsel['s] lack of skill and judgment."
 
Kekaualua's argument is unpersuasive. "[M]atters 
presumably within the judgment of counsel, like trial strategy, will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." State v. 
Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 39-40, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247-48 (1998) 
(emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Smith, 68 Haw. 304, 311, 712 P.2d 496, 501 (1986). Defense counsel's decision here to move Officer Le's follow-up report into evidence amounted to a strategic decision to contest Officer Le's prior inconsistent statement under HRE 802.1(1).
5 The fact 
5
 HRE 802.1(1) provides: 
The following statements previously made by witnesses
who testify at the trial or hearing are not excluded by the
hearsay rule:
 
(1)	 Inconsistent statement. The declarant is subject to
cross-examination concerning the subject matter of the
declarant's statement, the statement is inconsistent
with the declarant's testimony, the statement is
offered in compliance with rule 613(b), and the
statement was:
 
(A)	 Given under oath subject to the penalty of
perjury at a trial, hearing, or other
proceeding, or in a deposition; or
 
(B)	 Reduced to writing and signed or otherwise
adopted or approved by the declarant; or
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the State had what subsequently proved to the jury to be a
 
satisfactory response to that challenge does not mean that
 counsel's decision amounted to ineffective assistance. 
Therefore, we conclude that Kekaualua's ineffective
 
assistance of counsel arguments are meritless.
 
(2) Kekaualua argues that the deputy prosecutor engaged
 
in prosecutorial misconduct because her comments about Officer Le
 during rebuttal closing argument "amounted to personal views as
 to [his] credibility[.]" Specifically, Kekaualua complains that
 the deputy prosecutor:
 
expressed that because Le also works on occasion for federal
agencies, and because they would not take just anybody, that
"[t]hey're going to pick the good ones. They picked Officer
Le." Additionally, she stated that Le "has integrity . . .
He cares about his job. He's a good officer." Later, she
opined about Le: "He's credible." 
(Record citations omitted.)6
 
(C)	 Recorded in substantially verbatim fashion by
stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other
means contemporaneously with the making of the
statement[.]
 
Haw. R. Evid. 802.1(1) (1993). 
During trial, the court mistakenly referred to
this rule as "803.1."
 
6
 The prosecutor's following comments occurred during a portion of
rebuttal closing argument in which the prosecutor addressed the claim made by
defense counsel in his own closing argument that the HPD witnesses, including
Officer Le, had lied, offered perjured testimony, and blatantly fabricated
testimony:
 
What matters here is what the defendant did, okay,
and, it's clear from the evidence what the defendant did.
The evidence is as strong as it is in this case.
 
And, what does the defendant do?
 
I have an idea. Let's come up with a dirty â€“ with a
dirty cop story. Let's make Officer Le seem like he's a
 
dirty cop who has affairs with prostitutes and then he busts
them for drugs and he spearheads his whole operation to take
people down.
 
Let's create this smoke screen.
 
Let's talk about how HPD is dirty.
 Let's talk about this affair.
 Let's talk about how HPD messed up.
 Let's point out every typographical error.
 Small stuff.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kekaualua did not object to the challenged statements
 
during the prosecutor's rebuttal argument. Therefore, we
 
determine first whether the prosecutor's statements were improper
 and, if so, whether they constituted plain error that affected
 the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Clark, 83 Hawai
'i 
Let's bring up the small stuff because if the jury
gets caught up behind the smoke screen they might not see
the evidence, they might get confused and be led off track.
 
When you have nothing else, that's what you do, you
create a smoke screen.
 
The defense does not want you to focus on these
things. They don't want you to focus on Officer Le's
experience 23 years as an officer, nine years as an
undercover officer. He has done undercover officer work
 with ATF, Immigration, DEA, federal agencies. And, if we
think that HPD standard for undercover work is strict, he
worked for the feds. The federal agencies are not going to
be like just send us over any cop. We'll take anybody. We
 don't care about their experience, how good they are.
They're going to pick the good ones. They picked Officer
Le.
 
He's a good undercover cop. He has integrity. You
 
can tell by the way he testifies. He's passionate about
what he does. He cares about his job. He's a good officer.
 
Does he care about his job enough he'll just make up
anything just to convict anybody?
 
No.
 
His goal in this case was to see if people were
selling drugs. He wanted to bust drug dealers. And, that's
what he did. That's what the defendant is.
 
You saw him testify. He was credible.
 
Granted, he gets a little excited sometimes. He's
 
passionate again. You know that's his personality. It came
 
out to you on the stand.
 
But what you did see is that he knows what he's doing
and that he's honest to you when he testifies.
 
He had nothing to hide.
 
Every single time he went in for a drug transaction,
he's on tape. He's not turning off the tape because
something crooked is going down. He's on tape.
 
He has other officers around listening to him,
listening to how he's interacting, what he's doing.
 
He's credible.
 
He has evidence that supports what he testified to.

289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996). 
"[A] prosecutor, during closing argument, is permitted 
to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude 
is allowed in discussing the evidence." Clark, 83 Hawai 'i at 
304, 926 P.2d at 209 (citing State v. Apilando, 79 Hawai 'i 128, 
141â€“42, 900 P.2d 135, 148 (1995)). A prosecutor also "ha[s] latitude to respond in rebuttal closing to arguments raised by defense counsel in their closing. State v. Mars, 116 Hawai
'i 
125, 142, 170 P.3d 861, 878 (App. 2007) (citing People v. Sutton, 631 N.E.2d 1326, 1335 (Ill. App. Ct. 1994)). It is improper, however, for prosecutors to "express[] their personal views as to a defendant's guilt or the credibility of witnesses." Clark, 83 
Hawai
'i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209 (citing State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 
659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986); cf. Ex parte Waldrop, 459 So. 2d 959, 961 (Ala. 1984) ("Attorneys should be careful in their arguments to the jury to refrain from an injection of their own personal experience or knowledge in support of their argument, as distinguished from what they deem to be reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence." (quoting Brown v. State, 393 So. 2d 513 (Ala. Crim. App. 1981) (internal quotation marks omitted))). 
At what point legitimate argument and inferences 
traverse into the expression of improper personal views is not always clear, as a prosecutor need not explicitly indicate an expression as her own for it to constitute her personal view. See, e.g., State v. Suan, 121 Hawai
'i 169, 174â€“75, 214 P.3d 1159, 
1164â€“65 (App. 2009) (holding as improper: "The fact is that these officers have integrity. [T]heir testimony really is a testament to the fact that the system does work. They were telling the truth. They have integrity. They could have come in here[,] no reports, told you anything. They didn't." (emphasis omitted)). Also, the context in which statements are made necessarily informs their interpretation. See State v. Krueger, No. CAAP-12Â­
0000801, 2013 WL 6231717, at *12 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 29, 2013) ("We review the Prosecutor's remarks in context." (citing State v. Moore, No. 30001, 2010 WL 1843665 (Haw. Ct. App. May 10, 2010))); see also State v. Schmidt, 84 Hawai
'i 191, 203, 932 P.2d 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
328, 340 (App. 1997) (when "[t]he prosecutor's use of the term 
'we'" is "taken in context . . . ."). An "unqualified endorsement," however, is indicative of a personal opinion. See 
State v. Basham, ___ Hawai
'i ___, ___ P.3d ___, 2014 WL 502985, 
at *18 (Feb. 6, 2014). 
Here, none of the prosecutor's remarks could be 
construed as an unqualified endorsement. See id. The prosecutor 
was well within bounds when, in rebuttal, she confronted defense counsel's assertions that Officer Le and others had engaged in "blatant fabrication." See Mars, 116 Hawai
'i at 142, 170 P.3d at 
878. Significantly, in doing so, each of her statements touching
 on credibility is tethered directly to evidence before the jury:
 
He's a good undercover cop. He has integrity. You can tell
 
by the way he testifies.
 
. . . .
 
You saw him testify. He was credible.
 
Granted, he gets a little excited sometimes. He's
 
passionate again. You know that's his personality. It came
 
out to you on the stand.
 
But what you did see is that he knows what he's doing and
that he's honest to you when he testifies.
 
. . . .
 He's credible.
 
He has evidence that supports what he testified to.
 
(Emphasis added.) Cf. Krueger, 2013 WL 6231717, at *12
 
(concluding as proper a statement that "was ultimately tethered
 
to evidence"). As to the prosecutor's argument that Officer Le
 was a good cop, this was an inference legitimately drawn from
 evidence in the record, including Officer Le's lengthy work
 history, his time as an HPD undercover officer, and his selection
 for work details by several federal agencies.
7 Accordingly, and
 
"particularly when viewed in the context of the closing arguments
 as a whole," see Moore, 2010 WL 1843665, at *2, the prosecutor's
 remarks were not improper. Kekaualua was not deprived of a fair
 trial.
 
7
 The prosecutor's implication that selection for federal work is
itself indicative of a good officer may have been a step too far absent
supporting record evidence, but we decline to recognize this alone as
constituting reversible error.
