SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Appellants Dubin Financial, LLC, (Dubin Financial) and
 
Gary V. Dubin (Dubin) (collectively, Appellants) appeal from the
 
Order Affirming the Director's Final Order and Final Judgment
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 
1
Court)  on February 13, 2012.  This appeal arises out of a
 recommended order by the Hearings Officer of the Department of
 
Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA), and entry of such order by
 
the Director of DCCA, revoking Appellants' Mortgage Solicitor
 
License and Mortgage Broker License and imposing a fine based on
 
material misstatements on Dubin's license applications.

On appeal, Appellants argue that the Circuit Court
 
erred when it affirmed the order of the DCCA because (1) the DCCA
 
cannot revoke a withdrawn license pursuant to Chapter 454 of the
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS); (2) violation of HRS § 436B-19
 
does not permit imposition of a monetary fine; (3) the DCCA
 
lacked standing to bring a consumer complaint pursuant to HRS
 
§ 92-17; (4) the DCCA erroneously relied upon unpublished
 
decisions; and (5) there is not substantial evidence in the
 
record to support the conclusion that Dubin's alleged
 
misrepresentations were intentional or material.
 
Based on a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the applicable authority, and the
 
record, we resolve Appellants' points on appeal as follows and
 
affirm.
 
1. The expiration of Appellants' licenses was not a
 
bar to disciplinary action. Appellants argue that the DCCA erred
 
when it revoked their respective licenses because a previously
 
withdrawn license cannot be revoked. By a "withdrawn" license,
 
Appellants apparently mean "forfeiture, nonrenewal, surrender, or
 
voluntary relinquishment" thereof. The DCCA has jurisdiction
 
over a license regardless of withdrawal or forfeiture and has the
 
authority to revoke "withdrawn" licenses. HRS § 436B-22 (2013)2
 
2 Chapter 436B contains the Uniform Professional and Vocational
Licensing Act. HRS § 436B-22 provides that
 
The forfeiture, nonrenewal, surrender, or voluntary
relinquishment of a license by a licensee shall not bar
jurisdiction by the licensing authority to proceed with any
investigation, action, or proceeding to revoke, suspend,
condition, or limit the licensee's license or fine the
licensee.
 
"'Licensing authority' or 'authority' means the director," and the "'Director'
means the director of commerce and consumer affairs." HRS § 436B-2 (2013).
Chapter 436B "shall only be applicable to the professions and vocations
required by law to be regulated by the licensing authority." HRS § 436B-3(a)
(2013). Chapter 454 (1993) required licensing of mortgage brokers and
mortgage solicitors by the director of commerce and consumer affairs. See HRS
 
§ 454-3 (1993 and Supp. 2009), "Licensing, requirements, application." and
§ 454-1 (1993), "Definitions." (defining the "commissioner" as the director of
commerce and consumer affairs.)

and § 454-5(a) (1993).3
 
2. The DCCA has authority to fine a licensee. HRS
 
§§ 436B-22, 436B-18 (2013)4.
 
3. The DCCA has standing to investigate a licensee
 
upon its own motion. HRS § 92-17 provides that, "upon receipt of
 
an investigation report generated by the board on its own
 
motion," the DCCA may sanction a licensee.
 
4. The Hearings Officer did not err when he
 
considered unpublished opinions. Appellants do not indicate
 
3 The Petitions in this case were filed on November 9, 2010.
Chapter 454 was repealed and replaced by Chapter 454F, effective January 1,
2011. Act 84, §§ 29 and 38, 2010 Haw. Sess. Laws 156, 158. However, the
repeal of Chapter 454 "does not affect rights and duties that matured,
penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before
[January 1, 2011]. Act 84, § 35 Id., at 158. 
HRS § 454-5(a) provided that "[i]f the commissioner [DCCA Director,
HRS § 454-1] has reason to believe that a licensee or any person has violated
this chapter, or rules adopted pursuant thereto, or that any license issued
under the chapter may be subject to suspension or revocation," the DCCA could
investigate and take legal action. HRS § 454-5(a) (emphasis added).
 
4 HRS § 436B-18 provides that 
In addition to the licensing sanctions or remedies provided
by section 92-17 against any licensee, the licensing
authority may also impose conditions or limitations upon a
licensee's license after a hearing conducted in accordance
with chapter 91. The violation of any condition or
limitation on a licensee's license may be cause to impose
additional sanctions against the licensee. Unless otherwise
 provided by law, any fine imposed by the licensing authority
after a hearing in accordance with chapter 91 shall be no
less than $100 for each violation, and each day's violation
may be deemed a separate violation.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
HRS § 92-17 (2012) provides that
 
(b) Upon receipt of a written complaint or upon receipt of
an investigation report generated by the board on its own
motion or upon staff investigation which establishes an
alleged violation of any provision of law or rule, the board
or its authorized representative shall notify the licensee
or person regulated of the charge against the licensee or
person and conduct a hearing in conformity with chapter 91
if the matter cannot be settled informally. If the board
 finds that the charge constitutes a violation, the board may
order one or more of the following remedies as appropriate
relief: . . . (5) Imposition of a fine[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)

where in the record on appeal such an allegedly improper reliance 
occurred. Appellants thus failed to meet their burden of 
demonstrating "error by reference to matters in the record." 
State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i 333, 334, 3 P.3d 499, 500 (2000)). 
"[W]e will not presume error from a silent record." Id. at 336, 
3 P.3d at 502. Moreover, Appellants present no supporting 
authority for their assertion that a Hearings Officer may not 
rely on prior agency decisions. 
Regardless, we can find no clear prohibition, and the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has noted administrative decisions in the 
past. See Kim v. Contractors License Bd., 88 Hawai 'i 264, 268, 
965 P.2d 806, 810 (1998) (referencing a real estate broker's 
disciplinary hearing) and Gov't Emp. Ins. Co. v. Dang, 89 Hawai 'i 
8, 15, 967 P.2d 1066, 1073 (1998) (applying an earlier agency decision to that case). 
5. There was substantial evidence to support the
 
Hearing Officer's determination that violations occurred. 
Appellants argue that "the record and hearing transcript contain
 
insufficient evidence to establish the requisite intent and/or
 
materiality of the alleged violations." Appellants apparently do
 
not dispute that misrepresentations regarding Dubin's prior
 
conviction occurred, but rather whether such misrepresentations
 
were immaterial.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g)(5), administrative findings of
fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard,which requires [the appellate] court to sustain its findings"unless the court is left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made." Bumanglag v. Oahu
Sugar Co., Ltd., 78 Hawai' i 275, 279, 892 P.2d 468, 472
(1995) (block format and citation omitted). Administrative conclusions of law, however, are reviewed under the de novostandard inasmuch as they are "not binding on an appellatecourt." Id. (block format and citation omitted). "Where 
both mixed questions of fact and law are presented,deference will be given to the agency's expertise andexperience in the particular field and the court should notsubstitute its own judgment for that of the agency." Dole 
Hawaii Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71 Haw. 419, 424,794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990). "To be granted deference,however, the agency's decision must be consistent with thelegislative purpose." Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212, 216,
685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984).

Peroutka v. Cronin, 117 Hawai 'i 323, 326, 179 P.3d 1050, 1053 
(2008). 
The Hearings Officer made the following Findings of
 
Fact:
 
23. Question No. 6 on Respondent Dubin Financial's
mortgage broker's application and Question No. 8 on
Respondent Dubin's mortgage solicitor's [] application
require information that the commissioner has determined to
be necessary in order to further the appropriate licensing
of mortgage brokers and mortgage solicitors pursuant to
Chapter 454.
 
24. A "Yes" answer to those questions would not
necessarily result in a denial of a license. However, it
would provide information that could lead the commissioner
to request further information and/or make further inquiries
regarding the reported criminal convictions in order to
determine if the convictions had a bearing on the fitness of
the applicant for a license. A "No" answer to those
 questions, on the other hand, would not lead the
commissioner to request further information and/or make
further inquiries regarding the unreported criminal
convictions, and such an answer thus precludes the
commissioner from determining whether the criminal
convictions have a bearing on the fitness of the applicant
for a license.
 
25. A misrepresentation of the absence of criminal
convictions would be likely to induce the commissioner to
approve a license application whereas a correct statement
about the existence of criminal convictions could
 detrimentally affect the applicant's license application.
 
These unchallenged findings by the Hearings Officer indicate that 
the type of misrepresentations in question were material to the 
DCCA's application procedure. Appellants did not challenge these 
findings, and therefore they are binding on appeal. Pila'a 400, 
LLC v. Bd. of Land & Natural Res., 132 Hawai 'i 247, 268, 320 P.3d 
912, 933 (2014). 
To the extent the Hearings Officer's findings represent
 
mixed questions of law and fact, given the deference we must give
 
such agency determinations, Peroutka, id., he was not wrong. 
In Hawai 'i, an incorrect answer on a license 
application "is material if it would be likely to induce a 
reasonable person to manifest his assent, or the maker knows that 
it would be likely to induce the recipient to do so." Kim, 88 
Hawai'i at 271, 965 P.2d at 813 (citing Restatement of Contracts 
§ 162(2)). Furthermore, 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[t]he materiality of a misrepresentation is determined from
the viewpoint of the maker, while the justification of
reliance is determined from the viewpoint of the recipient.
The requirement of materiality may be met in either of two
 ways. First, a misrepresentation is material if it would be
likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent.
Second, it is material if the maker knows that for some
special reason it is likely to induce the particular
recipient to manifest his assent. There may be personal
considerations that the recipient regards as important even
though they would not be expected to affect others in his
situation, and if the maker is aware of this the
misrepresentation may be material even though it would not
be expected to induce a reasonable person to make the
proposed contract.
 
Id., 88 Hawai 'i at 271-72, 965 P.2d at 813-14 (quoting 
Restatement of Contracts § 162, cmt. c). In Kim, the Supreme 
Court of Hawai 'i held that contractors made material 
misrepresentations on their license applications when they negligently and carelessly provided false information in response 
to questions regarding previous debts and bankruptcy because HRS 
Chapter 444, the relevant licensing chapter, implicitly required 
applicants to have a sound financial history. Id., 88 Hawai
'i at 
272-73, 965 P.2d at 814-15. 
Similarly, in the instant case HRS Chapter 454 was
 
concerned with the financial integrity of applicants and
 licensees. For example, the DCCA "require[d] information with
 
regard to the applicant as the commissioner [DCCA] may deem
 
desirable, with due regard to the paramount interests of the
 
public, as to the experience, financial integrity, and competency
 
of the applicant as to the financial transactions involving
 
primary or subordinate mortgage financing." HRS § 454-3(d). 
Further, mortgage brokers were required to post $15,000 bond to
 
assure compliance with licensing statutes. HRS § 454-3(c). 
Finally, "[f]ailure to maintain a record or history of
 
competency, trustworthiness, fair dealing, and financial
 
integrity" were grounds for revocation or denial of all licensees
 
or applicants. HRS § 436B-19(8) (2013).
 
Taken together, financial integrity is a factor in
 
determining whether to award a license and where license
 
application questions are relevant to a statutorily-mandated

inquiry, those questions are necessarily material. See Kim, 88 
Hawai'i at 272, 965 P.2d at 814 (holding that application 
questions addressing the financial integrity and solvency of the 
applicant, by asking about past debts and bankruptcy, were 
material). The Appellants' "NO" answers were material because 
failing to disclose three convictions for failing to file federal 
tax returns could have induced the Program not to request further 
information or make further inquiries regarding the unreported 
criminal convictions, thus interfering with the Program's ability 
to determine whether Appellants had "maintain[ed] a record or 
history of competency, trustworthiness, fair dealing and 
financial integrity." In short, the misrepresentations 
undermined the Program's applicant evaluation process and 
therefore warranted revocations and imposition of fines by the 
DCCA. 
Based on the foregoing, the February 13, 2012 Order
 
Affirming the Director's Final Order and Final Judgment entered
 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
