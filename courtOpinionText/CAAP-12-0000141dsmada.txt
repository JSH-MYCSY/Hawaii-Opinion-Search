IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
DESIREE HOEWA' A-FONTANILLA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FELIPE BARROGA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(DC-CIVIL NO. 11-1-0362)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant Felipe
 
Barroga (Appellant Barroga) has asserted from the Honorable
 Blaine J. Kobayashi's March 23, 2012 "Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order Denying Defendant Felipe
 Barroga's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment Filed December 7,
 2011" (the March 23, 2012 interlocutory order), because the
 March 23, 2012 order is not an appealable final order pursuant to
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011).
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994) is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). In addition, "[a] post-judgment order is an 
appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto 
v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) 
(citation omitted). 
At first glance, Appellant Barroga's appeal from the
 
March 23, 2012 interlocutory order might appear to be an appeal
 from a post-judgment order, because Rule 55(c) of the District
 Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) provides that, "[f]or good
 cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a
 judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside
 in accordance with Rule 60(b)." Furthermore,
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) DCRCP Rule 60(b) expressly authorizes relief "from
a final judgment, order, or proceeding[,]"
 
(b) under analogous circumstances in a circuit court,"[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgmentrelief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealablefinal order under HRS § 641-1(a)" (Ditto v.McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i at 160, 80 P.3d at 981
(citation omitted), and 
(c) the March 23, 2012 interlocutory order deniedAppellant Barroga's motion to set aside thedistrict court clerk's July 5, 2011 notation inthe district court minutes that the district court intended to enter a default judgment in favor ofPlaintiff-Appellee Desiree Hoewa' a Fontanilla 
(Appellee Fontanilla). 
However, the district court specifically noted in finding of fact
 
number 7 in the March 23, 2012 interlocutory order that, to date,
 Appellee Fontanilla had not filed a written judgment in this
 case. The actual document that Appellant Barroga was attempting
 to set aside was the district court clerk's July 5, 2011 notation
 in the district court minutes that the district court intended to
 enter a default judgment in favor of Appellee Fontanilla. The
 district court clerk's notations in the district court minutes do
 not constitute an independently appealable order or judgment. 
Absent an appealable judgment or appealable order, the
 
March 23, 2012 interlocutory order does not qualify as an
 appealable post-judgment order disposing of a DCRCP Rule 60(b)
 post-judgment motion to set aside a judgment. In a district
 court case, "[f]or good cause shown the court may set aside an
 entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered,
 may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b)." DCRCP
 Rule 55(c). Nevertheless, "Rule 60(b) . . . applies only to
 motions attacking final, appealable orders[.]" United States v.
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Martin, 226 F.3d 1042, 1048 n.8 (9th
 Cir. 2000) (emphases added). 
"The standard test for whether a judgment is 'final' for 
Rule 60(b) purposes is usually stated to be whether the judgment is sufficiently 'final' to be appealed." 
12 James Wm. Moore et 
al., Moore's Federal Practice
 § 60.23, at 81-82 (3d ed. 2009) 
(footnote omitted). Therefore, under analogous circumstances in circuit court cases, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
acknowledged that "a motion for reconsideration, pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), is authorized only in situations involving final judgments." Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i at 382, 168 P.3d at 26 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); Crown Properties, Inc. v. Financial Security Life Insurance Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. at 112, 712 P.2d at 509 ("A Rule 60(b), HRCP, motion is authorized only in situations involving final judgments."); Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochrane, 8 Haw. App. at 262, 799 P.2d at 65 ("Rule 60(b) applies to motions seeking to amend final orders in the nature of judgments."). Without an appealable judgment or an appealable order, "relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b) was not available[.]" Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i at 
383, 382, 168 P.3d at 27. 
In the instant case, the district court has not yet 
entered a written final order or written final judgment that is independently appealable under HRS § 641-1(a) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 
1253. Therefore, the March 23, 2012 interlocutory order is not an appealable post-judgment order that resolves a DCRCP Rule 60(b) motion for post-judgment relief, but, instead, the 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
March 23, 2012 interlocutory order is merely a prejudgment, 
interlocutory order that will become eligible for appellate review by way of a timely appeal from a future written final order or written final judgment that formally ends this case by resolving all of the parties' claims. Cf. Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 
Hawai'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) ("An appeal from a 
final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Absent an appealable final order or appealable final judgment, Appellant Barroga's appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000141 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
