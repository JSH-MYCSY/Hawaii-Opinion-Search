(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
In an appeal arising from an action for ejectment,
 
Defendants-Appellants Landish K. Armitage and Robin R. Armitage
 
appeal from the February 9, 2012 Judgment for Possession entered
 
in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo Bank N.A., as Trustee

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

 The Honorable Barbara T. Takase presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that claims
 
involving the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i laws are 
without merit. The Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai
'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) reaffirmed this 
holding where it wrote:
 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the
Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm that
"[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness" of its
origins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now a lawful 
government." 
State v. Fergerstrom , 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 
P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d
225 (2004). Individuals claiming to be citizens of the
Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application
of the State's laws. See Id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State
 
v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai' i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State 
v French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.
1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment for Possession
 
entered February 9, 2012 in the District Court of the Third
 Circuit is affirmed.
