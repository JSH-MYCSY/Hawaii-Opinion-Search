APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-1487)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginzoa, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not 
have jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Patsy Naomi Sakuma's 
(Appellant Sakuma) appeal pursuant to her Notice of Appeal filed 
on March 7, 2012 from Civil No. 07-1-1487, the Honorable Bert I. 
Ayabe presiding, because the circuit court has not yet entered an 
appealable post-judgment order that adjudicates Appellant 
Sakuma's December 13, 2011 motion for relief pursuant to 
Rule 60(b) of the Hawai» i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
In the underlying foreclosure case, Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)(1) (Supp. 2011) authorized a timely
 
appeal from the circuit court's June 10, 2008 judgment on the
 
decree of foreclosure (June 10, 2008 judgment), and HRS § 667­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
51(a)(2) authorized a timely appeal from the circuit court's 
August 31, 2010 judgment on the order confirming the sale of the 
foreclosed property (August 31, 2010 judgment). Appellant Sakuma 
did not assert a timely appeal from either of these two 
judgments. Instead, Appellant Sakuma's March 7, 2012 notice of 
appeal asserts an appeal from the purported denial of Appellant 
Sakuma's December 13, 2011 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion 
to set aside the June 10, 2008 judgment and/or the August 31, 
2010 judgment. Once a circuit court has entered a judgment, as 
HRCP Rule 54(a)1 defines the word "judgment," a subsequent "post­
judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be 
accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai» i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). "[T]he separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins [v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai» i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994)] is 
inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai» i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
Clearly, the rule in Jenkins -- to wit, that circuit court
orders resolving claims against parties must generally be
reduced to a judgment and the judgment must be entered in
favor of or against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP
Rule 58 before an appeal may be taken  is limited to
 circuit court orders disposing of claims raised in a circuit
court complaint.
 
Id. at 159, 80 P.3d at 980. For example, "[a]n order denying a
 
motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an
 
appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a)." Id. at 160, 80
 
P.3d at 981 (citation omitted). However, in the instant case,
 
the circuit court has not yet entered a written post-judgment
 
order that ends the post-judgment proceeding for Appellant
 
Sakuma's December 13, 2011 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion.
 
In Appellant Sakuma's May 3, 2012 statement of
 
jurisdiction in appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000145,
 
Appellant Sakuma asserts that her December 13, 2011 HRCP Rule
 
1
 "'Judgment' as used in these rules includes a decree and any order
from which an appeal lies." HRCP Rule 54(a) (emphasis added).

60(b) post-judgment motion was automatically deemed denied under 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),2 which provides that, when a party files a 
timely post-judgment motion that invokes the tolling provision 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), "the failure to dispose of any motion by 
order entered upon the record within 90 days after the date the 
motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the motion." HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(3).3 However, the tolling provision under HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3) does not usually apply to an HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion. See, e.g., Simbajon v. Gentry, 81 Hawai» i 193, 
196, 914 P.2d 1386, 1389 (App. 1996) (noting that a motion under HRCP Rule 60(b) usually does not extend the time for filing a 
notice of appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)). Under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), 
"[a]n HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment may toll 
the period for appealing a judgment or order, but only if the 
motion is served and filed within ten (10) days after the 
judgment is entered." Lambert v. Lua,  92 Hawai» i 228, 234, 990 
P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999) (citation omitted). Appellant Sakuma 
did not file her December 13, 2011 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment 
motion within ten days after entry of either the June 10, 2008 
judgment or the August 31, 2010 judgment. Therefore, the 
provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) that deems timely post-judgment 
2 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions.
If any party files a timely  motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
 
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion.

 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) "provides that the court has 90 days to dispose
of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . , regardless of when the noticeof appeal is filed." Buscher v. Boning , 114 Hawai
»i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814,
833 (2007). When "the court fail[s] to issue an order on [the movant]'s[post-judgment tolling] motion by . . . ninety days after [the movant has]filed the [post-judgment tolling] motion, the [post-judgment tolling] motion
[i]s deemed denied." County of Hawai
»i v. C&J Coupe Family Limited
Partnership, 119 Hawai »i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008).

motions as being denied after ninety days does not apply to
 
Appellant Sakuma's December 13, 2011 HRCP Rule 60(b) post-
judgment motion. Absent an appealable final post-judgment order
 
that adjudicates Appellant Sakuma's December 13, 2011 HRCP
 
Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion, Appellant Sakuma's March 7, 2012
 
notice of appeal is premature, and we lack jurisdiction over
 
Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000145. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000145 is
 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
