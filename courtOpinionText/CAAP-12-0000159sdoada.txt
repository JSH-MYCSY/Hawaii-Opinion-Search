IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WEBSTER ALULI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(EWA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA–11-03226)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Webster Aluli (Aluli) appeals from 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment 
entered on February 14, 2012 (Judgment), by the District Court of 
the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division.1 Aluli was charged with and 
convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2012) and Driving Without Motor Vehicle 
Insurance (DWMVI) in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005). On 
appeal, Aluli raises six points of error. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Aluli's points of
 
error as follows:

Aluli's sole contention relating to the DWMVI
 
conviction (which he also asserts as to the OVUII conviction), is 
that the District Court erred as a matter of law by failing to 
grant judgment in his favor due to the failure of the prosecution 
to prove facts establishing venue in the ' Ewa Division of the 
District Court. This argument is without merit. See State v. 
Stanley, 110 Hawai' i 116, 122, 129 P.3d 1144, 1150 (App. 2005). 
With respect to the OVUII charge, Aluli argues, and the 
State acknowledges, that the District Court erred when it denied 
Aluli's motion to dismiss the OVUII charge because the charge 
does not allege the requisite state of mind. We agree. See 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). 
Therefore, we vacate Aluli's OVUII conviction and remand this 
case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII 
charge without prejudice. Id. at 54, 276 P.3d at 623; see also 
State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 
(2012). Accordingly, we need not address Aluli's remaining 
arguments. 
For these reasons, the District Court's February 14,
 
2012 Judgment is affirmed in part, with respect to Aluli's
 
conviction for DWMVI, and vacated and remanded for dismissal
 
without prejudice of the OVUII charge against Aluli.
