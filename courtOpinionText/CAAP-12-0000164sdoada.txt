SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Plaintiff Counter Claimant/Appellant Lee T.Y.
 
Bise appeals from the November 29, 2011 Judgment for Possession
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Federal National Mortgage
 
Association in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit1.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 appeal is without merit.
 
Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that claims
 
involving the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i laws are 
without merit. The Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai
'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) reaffirmed this 
holding where it wrote:
 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the
Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm that
"[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness" of its
origins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now a lawful 
government." State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 
P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), 
aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d
225 (2004). Individuals claiming to be citizens of the
Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application
of the State's laws. See Id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State
 
v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai' i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State 
v French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.
1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Therefore,
 
1
 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
