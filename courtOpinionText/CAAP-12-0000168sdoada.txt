Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Interlocutory Decree
 
Of Foreclosure Filed May 26, 2011"; 
(2) the February 16, 2012 "Order Granting Plaintiff's
 
Motion For Confirmation Of Sale, For Deficiency of Judgment, For
 
Writ Of Possession And Cancellation Of Notice Of Pendency Of
 
Action";
 
(3) the February 16, 2012 "Judgment"; and 
(4) the April 9, 2012 "Order Denying Defendant Binh's
 
Motion for Reconsideration of Judgment And Order Dated January
 10, 2012 of Plaintiff Summary Judgment of Defendant's
 
Counterclaim Filed Sept 28, 2010 Pursuant to Rule 59 And Rule
 
60(b)(3) and (6) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure." The
 
circuit court found in favor on Plaintiff/Counterclaim
 
Defendant/Appellee Finance Factors, Limited (Finance Factors) in
 
this foreclosure action against Binh. 
In this consolidated appeal Binh contends the circuit
 
court erred when it:
 
(1) violated Title II of the Americans with
 
Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to provide reasonable
 
accommodations for Binh's severe hearing impairment;
 
(2) denied Binh's motion for relief from judgment under 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b); and 
(3) denied Binh's motion for reconsideration.
2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted
 
by the parties and having given due consideration to the
 arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well
 
as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Bihn's appeal
 
is without merit.
 
(1) Binh contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion by denying her motion for relief from judgment despite
 
2
 Binh listed a fourth point of error alleging prejudicial actions of
the circuit court in her opening brief, but presented no arguments in support
of the fourth point of error. Under Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule
28(b)(7), "[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived." Therefore, Binh'sfourth point of error is deemed waived. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the failure to provide reasonable accommodations for her severe
 
hearing impairment as required under Title II of the Americans
 
with Disabilities Act (ADA).
 
Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 12132 (2012), Title II of the ADA is
 
"[s]ubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified
 
individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,
 
be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of
 
the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be
 
subjected to discrimination[.]" In order to establish that the
 
circuit court violated Title II of the ADA, Binh must show that:
 
"(1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) she was
 
excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against
 
with regard to a public entity's services, programs, or
 
activities[;] and (3) such exclusion or discrimination was by
 
reason of her disability." Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039,
 
1052 (9th Cir. 2002). 
Neither party disputes whether Binh is a qualified
 
individual under ADA since Binh was a party litigant that suffers
 from severe hearing impairment. The issue is whether the
 
accommodations provided by the circuit court were reasonable as
 
to allow Binh to participate equally in the proceedings. In
 
order to prevail on this issue, "[Binh] must show that the
 
accommodations offered by the [circuit court] were not
 
reasonable, and that [s]he was unable to participate equally in
 
the proceedings at issue." Duvall v. Cnty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d
 
1124, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). 
Federal regulations provide "[a] public entity shall
 
furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary
 to afford individuals with disabilities, . . . an equal
 
opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a
 
service, program, or activity of a public entity." 28 C.F.R.
 
ยง 35.160(b)(1) (2011). Binh requested a headset hearing device
 
and the circuit court provided a headset hearing device at each
 
proceeding.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nothing in the record indicates that Binh was unable to
 
equally participate in the proceedings. At the proceeding held
 
December 7, 2011, Binh claimed she was unable to hear in the
 
previous proceedings which hindered her ability to participate in
 
the hearing. Binh stated the headsets were uncomfortable and the
 
sound was not ideal. However, the transcripts from both the May
 
4, 2011 and October 5, 2011 hearings show that although Binh
 
expressed some dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the
 
headset, she actively participated in the proceeding.
 
Binh fails to show that the accommodation provided by
 
the circuit court prevented her from equally participating in the
 
proceedings. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Binh's request for relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) for
 
any violations under Title II of the ADA. 
(2) Binh contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion by failing to consider the new evidence submitted in
 
support of her Rule 60(b) motion. Binh presented an audit report
 
performed by a forensic loan expert (Audit Report) in support of
 
her claim that Finance Factors engaged in predatory lending
 
practices.
 
HRCP Rule 60 provides in part that "(b) . . . the court
 
may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or
 
proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (2) newly discovered
 
evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in
 
time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)[.]" In order to
 
warrant relief, newly discovered evidence must meet the following
 
criteria: "(1) it must be previously undiscovered even though due
 
diligence was exercised; (2) it must be admissible and credible;
 
(3) it must be of such a material and controlling nature as will 
probably change the outcome and not merely cumulative or tending 
only to impeach or contradict a witness." Kawamata Farms, Inc v. 
United Agri Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 251, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092 
(1997) (quoting Orso v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 56 Haw. 241, 
250, 534 P.2d 489, 494 (1975). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Audit Report fails to satisfy the first criterion
 
because it was not undiscovered despite due diligence. The Audit
 
Report analyzes information available in loan documents from
 
2008. Though the Audit Report provides a more in depth analysis
 
of the language contained within the loan documents, Binh could
 
have sought such an analysis prior to Plaintiff's motion for
 
summary judgment. 
In Matsumoto v. Asamura, 5 Haw. App. 628, 632-33, 706
 
P.2d 1311, 1314 (1985), a party sought relief from a final
 
judgment by submitting results of a medical examination revealing
 
a previously undiagnosed injury as newly discovered evidence. 
This court held that since the medical examination merely
 
provided confirmation of information that was readily available
 
to the party prior to the conclusion of proceedings, it was not
 
previously discovered even though due diligence was exercised. 
Matsumoto, 5 Haw. App. at 633, 706 P.2d at 1315. In this case,
 
the audit did not provide.
 
Furthermore, the circuit court did not err in ruling
 
the Audit Report did not present any outcome determinative
 
evidence. The Audit Report failed to create any genuine issues
 
of material fact as to Binh's allegations of various violations
 
of the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures
 
Act.
 
(3) In support of her motion for reconsideration, Binh 
offered the Audit Report presented at the proceedings held 
January 24, 2012, on her Rule 60(b) motion. "It is well 
established that the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is 
to allow the parties to present new evidence or arguments that 
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated 
motion. . . . [The] motion for reconsideration is not time to 
relitigate old matters." Ass'n Of Home Owners of Kai Nui Court 
ex. rel. Bd. of Dir. v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai' i 
119, 121, 185 P.3d 867, 869 (App. 2008) (internal quotation marks 
and citations omitted). Binh made the same arguments and 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
presented the same evidence as she did in her prior Rule 60(b)
 
motion. The circuit court did not err by denying Binh's motion
 
for reconsideration. 
Therefore the 
(1) February 16, 2012 "Order Denying Defendant Joan
 
Binh's Motion for an Emergency Stay to Vacate, Amend And, Or
 Modify Order, Pursuant To HRCP 60(b)(1), (3) and (6), Granting
