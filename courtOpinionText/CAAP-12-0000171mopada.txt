I. BACKGROUND
 
Roman was struck by a vehicle on February 18, 2010. 
Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) insured the
 
vehicle under a policy that included both personal injury
 
protection (PIP) and additional personal injury protection
 
(APIP). The policy's terms limited PIP benefits to $10,000,
 
which GEICO paid to Roman. Roman also claimed $20,000 in APIP
 
benefits. However, GEICO asserted that under the policy language
 
Roman was not eligible for APIP coverage, and it disputed Roman's
 
claim for $20,000.
 
On August 25, 2010, Roman filed a complaint to the
 
Insurance Division, challenging GEICO's determination that he did
 
not qualify for APIP benefits and requesting a hearing. The
 
Insurance Commissioner denied Roman's hearing request, stating
 
the Insurance Division lacked jurisdiction over Roman's claims.
 
On January 12, 2011, Roman filed a notice of appeal in
 
the circuit court pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91­
14 (2012 Repl.). The circuit court heard oral argument on June
 
16, 2011. The circuit court then entered the July 5, 2011 "Order
 
Denying Claimant-Appellant Appeal And Affirming The Insurance
 
Commissioner's Jurisdictional Abstention" and the February 16,
 
2012 "Judgment," affirming the Insurance Commissioner's decision. 
Roman filed a timely notice of appeal on March 14,
 
2012. On appeal, Roman contends he is entitled to an
 
administrative hearing before the Insurance Commissioner.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.
In an appeal from a circuit court's review of an
administrative decision the appellate court will utilize
identical standards applied by the circuit court. . . . [A]n
agency's legal conclusions are freely reviewable.

Indus. Relations, 110 Hawai' i 259, 265, 132 P.3d 368, 374 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

III. DISCUSSION
 
Pursuant to HRS § 431:10C-212 (2005 Repl.), the
 
Insurance Commissioner's jurisdiction is limited to "review[ing]
 
any denial of [PIP] benefits" made pursuant to HRS § 431:10C­
304(3)(B). Under HRS § 431:10C-212, the Insurance Commissioner
 
has the authority to "[a]ffirm the denial or reject the denial
 
and order the payment of benefits as the facts may warrant," and
 
to "assess the cost of the hearing upon either or both of the
 
parties." HRS § 431:10C-212(c)(3), (d).
 
Here, GEICO did not deny Roman's claim for PIP
 
benefits, but it refused to extend APIP coverage based on its
 
interpretation of the insurance policy. Roman's complaint to the
 
Insurance Division asserted that he is entitled to APIP coverage,
 
and he raised several equitable claims. Specifically, Roman
 
argued a portion of the policy agreement is "void as a matter of
 
law," and the doctrines of waiver and estoppel apply against
 
GEICO and prevent GEICO from disclaiming APIP coverage to Roman.
 
However, such claims are not within the Insurance 
Commissioner's powers of administrative review. Nothing in 
HRS § 431:10C-212 or in HRS Chapter 431:10C (2005 Repl.) gives 
the Insurance Commissioner the authority to order an insurer to 
provide coverage (as opposed to benefits) when the insurer 
disclaims coverage under the insurance policy. The Insurance 
Commissioner also lacks the statutory authority to provide the 
equitable relief Roman requested. An administrative agency can 
only wield powers delegated to it by the legislature, and "an 
agency cannot exercise general or common law powers." Preble v. 
Bd. of Trustees of Employees' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai' i, 111 
Hawai'i 498, 505, 143 P.3d 37, 44 (2006) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). Therefore, the circuit court did not err when it affirmed the Insurance Commissioner's denial of an administrative 
hearing.
