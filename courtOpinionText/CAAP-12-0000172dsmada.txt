INTEGRATED HEALTH RESOURCES, LLC d/b/a INTEGRATED HEALTH
SERVICES, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GENEVIEVE WALKER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC 12-1-608)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Genevieve Walker (Appellant Walker) has asserted from the
 Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes's February 28, 2012 order
 striking Appellant Walker's answer and counterclaim, the
 February 28, 2012 order striking Appellant Walker's answer and
 counterclaim is an interlocutory order, and the district court
 has not yet entered an appealable final order or final judgment
 in this case.
 
Appellant Walker is appealing pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). 
The district court has not entered a final order or 
final judgment that fully disposes of this action in the district 
court. Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b), the February 28, 2012 order striking Appellant Walker's answer and counterclaim does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three
 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order
 doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an
 appeal from an interlocutory order). Therefore, the February 28,
 2012 order striking Appellant Walker's answer and counterclaim is
 not an appealable order. Absent an appealable order or
 appealable judgment, this appeal is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction over Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000172. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000172 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
