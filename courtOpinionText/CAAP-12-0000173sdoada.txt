APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(DC CIVIL NO. 11-1-0353)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this action for ejectment, Defendant-Appellant
 
Barbara J.K. Duarte (Duarte) appeals from the Judgment for
 
Possession entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Federal
 National Mortgage Association, which was filed on February 15,
 2012, in the District Court of the Second Circuit (District
 Court).

The sole argument raised by Duarte on appeal is that
 
the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over her
 case because she has demonstrated the continuing existence of the
 Hawaiian Kingdom. Our appellate courts, however, have repeatedly
 held that claims of this nature are without merit. In 
State v.
 
1The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided.

Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013), the Hawai'i Supreme 
Court reaffirmed this view where it stated: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from
the court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of
the Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm
that "[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness"
of its origins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now, a
lawful government." State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 
43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106
Hawai
'i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). Individuals claiming
to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are
not exempt from application of the State's laws. See
 
id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77
Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State v.
French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182
(App. 1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d
444 (1999).
 
Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i at 487, 291 P.3d at 385 (ellipsis points and 
brackets in original).
 
Accordingly, the February 15, 2012, Judgment for
 
Possession entered by the District Court is affirmed.
