(REPORT NO. C11033120/KN (3P711-1899))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant James David Kalili (Kalili) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, entered on
 
February 22, 2012 in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 
Kona Division (District Court).1
 
Kalili was found guilty of Criminal Contempt of Court,
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 710-1077(1)(g)
 
(1993).2

 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo, Jr. presided.

 HRS § 710-1077 states:
 
§710-1077 Criminal contempt of court. (1) A person
commits the offense of criminal contempt of court if:
 
. . . .
 
(g)	 The person knowingly disobeys or resists the
process, injunction, or other mandate of a
court;
 
(continued...)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Kalili contends (1) the judge plainly erred
 
by not recusing himself from the case because the same judge
 
issued the order which Kalili was accused of disobeying, (2)
 
there was insufficient evidence to convict him, and (3) the
 
District Court erred by failing to enter written findings as
 
required by HRS § 710-1077(5) (1993).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
2(...continued)
 
. . . .
 
(2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (7),
criminal contempt of court is a misdemeanor.
 
(3) The court may treat the commission of an offense
under subsection (1) as a petty misdemeanor, in which case:
 
(a)	 If the offense was committed in the immediate
 
view and presence of the court, or under such
circumstances that the court has knowledge of
all of the facts constituting the offense, the
court may order summary conviction and
disposition; and
 
(b)	 If the offense was not committed in the
 
immediate view and presence of the court, nor
under such circumstances that the court has
 knowledge of all of the facts constituting the
offense, the court shall order the defendant to
appear before it to answer a charge of criminal
contempt of court; the trial, if any, upon the
charge shall be by the court without a jury; and
proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt shall
be required for conviction.
 
. . . .
 
(5) Whenever any person is convicted of criminal
contempt of court or sentenced therefor, the particular
circumstances of the offense shall be fully set forth in the
judgment and in the order or warrant of commitment. In any
proceeding for review of the judgment, sentence, or
commitment, no presumption of law shall be made in support
of the jurisdiction to render the judgment, pronounce the
sentence, or order the commitment. A judgment, sentence, or
commitment under subsection (3)(a) shall not be subject to
review by appeal, but shall be subject to review in an
appropriate proceeding for an extraordinary writ or in a
special proceeding for review.
 
All other judgments, sentences, or commitments for
criminal contempt of court shall be subject to review by
appeal, in a proceeding for an appropriate extraordinary
writ, or in a special proceeding for review.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kalili's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Kalili did not move to disqualify the judge at 
trial. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that "it will apply 
the plain error standard of review to correct errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of 
judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to 
prevent the denial of fundamental rights." 
State v. Miller , 122 
Hawai'i 92, 100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010) (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and emphasis omitted). A procedure whereby the 
judge who caused a criminal contempt proceeding to be instituted 
and who conducts the trial, without a jury, upon the charge, 
denies the accused due process and is a matter of public concern 
warranting plain error review. State v. Brown, 70 Haw. 459, 466­
67, 776 P.2d 1182, 1187 (1989). 
Kalili was charged with Criminal Contempt of Court for 
failing to surrender at the Hawai 'i Community Correctional Center 
(HCCC) as ordered by the District Court. The presiding judge was 
the same judge that issued the order that Kalili was accused of 
violating. Kalili's alleged failure to surrender was not 
committed in the immediate view and presence of the judge nor 
under circumstances that would have given the judge knowledge of 
all of the facts constituting the offense. Therefore, this was a 
case of indirect constructive criminal contempt. Evans v. Takao, 
74 Haw. 267, 289, 842 P.2d 255, 265 (1992). The judge that presides over an indirect constructive criminal case must be a 
different judge than the one whose order the defendant is accused 
of violating. Gowan v. Kubo, No. SCPW-13-0000017 2013 WL 1919393 
at *2 (Haw. May 8, 2013) (unpublished order) (citing Brown, 70 Haw. at 467, 776 P.2d at 1187-88). Therefore, we hold that the 
presiding judge plainly erred by failing to recuse himself from 
presiding over Kalili's trial. 
(2) Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the prosecution, State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 
P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), we conclude there was substantial

evidence to support Kalili's conviction. Kalili does not
 
challenge the admissibility of any of the evidence presented at
 
trial. Kona District Court Bailiff Joseph Gusman (Gusman)
 
identified Kalili as the person who, on October 3, 2011, was
 
ordered to report to the HCCC on October 10, 2011 to serve a
 
thirty-day sentence. State's Exhibit 4, the "HCCC Non­
Admission/Late Admission/Violations Report" indicated that
 
James D. Kalili, Jr. failed to report to HCCC on October 10,
 
2011. Kalili testified that he appeared in court on October 3,
 
2011 and acknowledged that the judge told him when to go to jail. 
Kalili also agreed that on October 3, 2011 he signed the court's
 
notice that he was to report to HCCC on October 10, 2011 to serve
 
a thirty-day sentence.
 
On appeal, Kalili argues that he lacked the requisite
 
intent to commit the offense. Kalili maintained at trial that he
 
"didn't know exactly how many days I had from that day,
 
October 3rd, to when I was to turn myself in because I had
 
motioned to the Court for more time. I needed to file a motion
 
with the Court for stay of execution to file an appeal." 
Nevertheless, Kalili also acknowledged that the court did not
 
grant his motion for time or a stay of execution. This is
 
consistent with a copy of the court's minutes for October 3,
 
2011, which states, "DEFT PRESENT. REQUEST OF DEFT TO CONTINUE
 
TO FILE MOTION FOR MISTRIAL-DENIED. JAIL SENTENCE IMPOSED." 
Therefore, there was substantial evidence from which the District
 
Court could infer that Kalili knowingly disobeyed a court's order
 
to report to HCCC.
 
(3) Kalili contends, and the State concedes, that it
 
was error for the District Court to not issue written findings,
 
pursuant to HRS § 710-1077(5). "HRS § 710-1077(5) expressly
 
provides that '[w]henever any person is convicted of criminal
 
contempt of court and sentenced therefor, the particular
 
circumstances of the offense shall be fully set forth in the
 
judgment and in the order or warrant of commitment.'" State v.
 
Schutter, 60 Haw. 221, 221, 588 P.2d 428, 429 (1978) (quoting HRS
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 710-1077(5)). The failure of the trial court to comply with 
the statute also warrants vacation of the judgment. State v. 
Lloyd, 88 Hawai 'i 188, 190, 964 P.2d 642, 644 (1998). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order, entered on February 22, 2012 in the
 District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division is vacated and
 
the case is remanded for a new trial before a different judge.
