NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree in violation of HRS

§ 708-823 (Supp. 2012). On appeal, Sanford contends that the
 
Circuit Court plainly erred in failing to properly instruct the

jury on the UEMV charge.

Upon careful review of the records and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we

resolve Sanford's appeal as follows:

Sanford contends that the Circuit Court erred because 
its UEMV instruction "failed to separate the intent element and the actual act[,]" and because that instruction "failed to specify and separate the state of mind for the first and second elements of the offense of UEMV." Sanford further argues that the Circuit Court's erroneous instructions "'adversely affected' [his] 'substantial rights and, as such, constituted [plain] error[,]'" citing State v. Aganon, 97 Hawai' i 299, 302-03, 36 
P.3d 1269, 1272-73 (2001). 
As to his first structure-of-the-instruction argument, 
Sanford notes that he requested that the court issue Hawai' i 
Pattern Jury Instructions – Criminal ("HAWJIC") 10.45A, but that, over the objection of both Sanford and the State, the court refused and issued its own UEMV instruction. The failure to strictly conform to an HAWJIC standard jury instruction, however, "does not automatically result in [an] incomplete and confusing jury instruction[]." State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 325, 
335, 966 P.2d 637, 647 (1998). Furthermore, "the trial court is not required to instruct the jury in the exact words of the applicable statute but to present the jury with an understandable instruction that aids the jury in applying that law to the facts of the case." Id. at 330, 966 P.2d at 642 (quoting State v. Apo, 
59 Haw. 625, 645, 586 P.2d 250, 263 (1978)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawai' i 206, 230, 
297 P.3d 1062, 1086 (2013). 
Sanford claims that "[b]y virtue of the Court's failure

to instruct the jury regarding the state of mind as to each

material element, the jury could have found [him] guilty of UEMV

even though it did not find the requisite state of mind with

2

respect to each element of the offense." Sanford does not

explain how the instruction's modification affected the outcome

of his case. He does not elaborate on how the Circuit Court's

instruction lacked accurate definitions; that is, how one can

"unlawfully enter" a motor vehicle but not enter it "without

being invited, licensed or otherwise authorized to do so." 
 Furthermore, he fails to address how the modified instruction

does not specify the required state of mind for each element.

Similar to the case in State v. Sale, 110 Hawai' i 386, 
133 P.3d 815 (App. 2006), the Circuit Court here addressed a redundancy in the standard jury instruction in order to create a clearer instruction. Instead of omitting an element as the court did in Sale, however, the Circuit Court here combined the first and second HAWJIC UEMV elements into one element in its modified instruction.
3/ The Circuit Court looked at the meaning of 
"unlawful entry"4/ in the definitions section of the criminal 
statutes and concluded that: 
if you look at the definition of "unlawfully entering or
remaining" that prefaces the entire 708 chapter, and it
mainly is in the burglary context, the definition of
unlawfully entering is exactly without being invited,
licensed or otherwise privileged is the word used, instead
of authorized in the standard 708 definition of unlawful

entry, what it means.

The court then viewed the second element in the HAWJIC

instructions – "did so without being invited, licensed, or

otherwise authorized to enter or remain within the vehicle" – and

determined that the only difference between that element and the

term "unlawful entry" were the words "authorized" and

"privileged," which the court regarded as immaterial. 
 
But [in] this Court's view, the difference between
authorized and privileged is immaterial. Essentially, as I
say, the definition of an unlawful entry is an entry without
being invited, licensed or otherwise privileged or
authorized to do so. 
 
3/

The State had no objection to the instruction having two elements,
as opposed to three.

4/

"Enter or remain unlawfully" means to enter or
remain in or upon premises when the person is not
licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to do so.

In other words, the statute is completely redundant,
in my view. It reads, in effect, intentionally or knowingly,
unlawfully enters a motor vehicle unlawfully with the intent
to commit within the motor vehicle a crime.

The Circuit Court did not err in following Sale. What 
occurred here is arguably clearer than what occurred in Sale, 
because the element "unlawful entry" was not removed and the modified instruction, through the preposition "by," then provided a definition for that element. Additionally, the Circuit Court included a definition for "entry" following the two material elements, pursuant to case law. See State v. Faria, 100 Hawai' i 
383, 389, 60 P.3d 333, 339 (2002). Thus, the resulting jury instruction provided definitions of "unlawful entry" and "entry," without being repetitive or confusing. 
Although the HAWJIC pattern jury instructions contain 
four elements, the Circuit Court was not obligated to follow them. The court is required to provide "an understandable instruction that aids the jury in applying that law to the facts of the case." See Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i at 330, 966 P.2d at 642 
(quoting Apo, 59 Haw. at 645, 586 P.2d at 263). Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that the two terms were redundant, and thus did not err in modifying the instruction and providing an instruction that aided the jury in understanding the law while eliminating redundancy. 
As to Sanford's second, substantial rights, argument, 
in Aganon, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that a trial court 
erred when it adversely affected defendant's substantial rights by requiring unanimous agreement as to only one of three material elements. 97 Hawai' i at 302-03, 36 P.3d at 1272-73. Aganon, 
however, is distinguishable from the instant case, because here the Circuit Court required that the jury unanimously agree to each element, twice instructing the jury on the matter. 
Similarly, the Circuit Court's combination of elements 
in this case, if error at all, does not constitute prejudicial error. See State v. Sugihara, 101 Hawai' i 361, 367, 68 P.3d 635, 
641 (App. 2003) ("But we look to the Aganon court's further conclusion, that 'the jury instructions were substantively, if not technically, correct' in this respect. . . . The combination 
4

of conduct and result in a single element does not, in and of

itself, portend prejudice." (citations omitted))

The instruction required the jury to find two, rather

than three elements: that Sanford (1) intentionally or knowingly

"unlawfully entered" by entering "without being invited,

licensed, or otherwise authorized to enter or remain within the

vehicle," and (2) that he did so while intending to commit a

crime. The state of mind remained applicable to the first two

HAWJIC elements, now combined into one. Sanford does not address

why the first two HAWJIC elements differ, or why they should not

be combined. Therefore, the Circuit Court's modified instruction

was substantively correct and, thus, it did not adversely affect

Sanford's rights. 
 
Therefore, the February 22, 2012 Judgment of Conviction

and Probation Sentence and Judgment of Conviction and Sentence,

entered and filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are

affirmed.
