ANDREW JOSIAH RODRIGUEZ, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0819)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Andrew Josiah Rodriguez (Rodriguez)
 
appeals from a Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment)
 
filed on March 19, 2012, in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court).  Judgment was entered against Rodriguez
 for Kidnapping in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
2
§ 707-720(1)(e) (Supp 2012),  and Assault in the Third Degree in
violation of HRS § 707-712 (1993 Repl.).

 HRS § 707-720(1)(e) provides that "[a] person commits the offense of
kidnapping if the person intentionally or knowingly restrains another person
with intent to . . . [t]errorize that person or a third person[.]"
3
 HRS § 707-712(1) provides that "[a] person commits the offense of
assault in the third degree if the person: (a) Intentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly causes bodily injury to another person; or (b) Negligently causes
bodily injury to another person with a dangerous instrument."

On appeal, Rodriguez contends that (1) the circuit
 
court's instructions were prejudicially erroneous when they
 
failed to define the term "terrorize," and (2) there was no
 
substantial evidence to support Rodriguez's conviction for
 
Kidnapping. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 
Rodriguez's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err when it gave the jury 
instruction on the elements of the offense of Kidnapping without 
defining the term "terrorize." At trial, Rodriguez did not 
object to the jury instruction; therefore, it is his burden to 
rebut the presumption that jury instructions not objected to are 
correct. State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 337 n.6, 141 P.3d 
974, 984 n.6 (2006). 
"It is a grave error to submit a [criminal] case to a
 
jury without accurately defining the offense charged and its
 elements." State v. Pinero, 70 Haw. 509, 526, 778 P.2d 704, 715
 
(1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). An
 erroneous jury instruction is grounds for reversal "unless it
 
affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error
 
was not prejudicial." Pinero, 70 Haw. at 526, 778 P.2d at 716
 
(citation and internal quotation mark omitted).
 
The circuit court instructed the jury as follows:
 
In Count 1, Defendant Andrew Josiah Rodriguez is
charged with the offense of Kidnapping.
 
A person commits the offense of Kidnapping if he
intentionally or knowingly restrains a person with intent to
terrorize that person.
 
There are three material elements of the offense of
 
Kidnapping, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond
a reasonable doubt.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
These three elements are:
 
1. That, on or about May 15, 2010, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, the Defendant Andrew
Josiah Rodriguez restrained Ezra Kualaau; and
 
2. That Defendant Andrew Josiah Rodriguez did so
intentionally or knowingly; and
 
3. That Defendant Andrew Josiah Rodriguez did so with
the intent to terrorize Ezra Kualaau.
 
(Emphases added.) 
In the jury instructions, the circuit court gave the
 
statutory definitions of "intentionally," "knowingly," and
 
"restrain," among others. The court did not provide a definition
 
of "terrorize," nor did either party request a definition or
 
object to the absence of a definition of "terrorize." 
Neither the HRS nor the Hawai' i Pattern Jury 
4
Instructions  provide a definition of the term "terrorize."  See
 
HRS § 707-700 (1993 Repl. and Supp. 2012) (definitions of terms
 relating to offenses against the person). 
Where there is no
 
5
statutory definition, HRS § 701-104 (1993 Repl.)  applies, which
provides the principles of construction for interpreting 
provisions of the Hawai' i Penal Code (Code). See State v. 
Cavness
, 80 Hawai' i 460, 466, 911 P.2d 95, 101 (App. 1996) 
(HRS § 701-104 applies where criminal statute did not define a 
phrase). Pursuant to HRS § 701-104, provisions of the Code 
"shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair 
4
 See Hawaii Standard Jury Instructions Criminal, Instruction 9.35,
 
Kidnapping–-Intent to Terrorize: H.R.S. § 707-720(1)(e).
5
 HRS § 701-104 provides:
 
§701-104 Principles of construction.  The provisions of
this Code [Hawaii Penal Code] cannot be extended by analogy so as
to create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to
promote justice and effect the objects of the law, all of its
provisions shall be given a genuine construction, according to the
fair import of the words, taken in their usual sense, in
connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of
the provision.
 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
import of the words, taken in their usual sense[.]" HRS § 701­
104. 
Applying the foregoing principles, we note that the
 
ordinary and usual meaning of "terrorize" is "1: to fill with
 
terror or anxiety: SCARE 2: to coerce by threat or violence[.]" 
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1213 (10th ed. 2000). 
Rodriguez relies on State v. Yamamoto, 98 Hawai' i 208, 
46 P.3d 1092 (App. 2002), to assert that the circuit court erred 
in failing to instruct the jury on the definition of "terrorize." 
Yamamoto, however, does not support Rodriguez's assertion. In 
Yamamoto, the trial court instructed the jury that "[t]errorize 
means the risk of causing another person serious alarm for his or 
her personal safety." Yamamoto, 98 Hawai' i at 209, 46 P.3d at 
1093 (emphasis added). This court concluded that the trial court had erred because the definition had "no basis in our criminal 
statutes," and the instruction was erroneous for "implying that a 
person is guilty of kidnapping if he or she intends the mere risk 
of causing another person serious alarm for his or her personal 
safety[.]" Yamamoto, 98 Hawai' i at 217, 46 P.3d at 1101 
(emphasis added). The ruling in Yamamoto does not require a trial court to provide a definition of "terrorize" for a 
Kidnapping charge, nor does that case suggest that it would be 
error not to provide such a definition.
6 Rodriguez fails to 
establish that the omission of a definition for "terrorize" was erroneous and thus presumptively harmful. 
At the end of the first day of deliberations, the jury
 
sent "Communication No. 1 from the Jury," asking the circuit
 
court, "What is the definition of terrorize?" The court
 
6
 Indeed, it was noted in Yamamoto that the defendant in that case had 
objected to the instruction defining "terrorize" because, inter alia, it was
not a statutory definition and "it is a common everyday thing that the jurycan define for themselves." 98 Hawai' i at 215 n.3, 46 P.3d at 1099 n.3. 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
responded, "Please refer to all of the Court's instructions to
 
you." Neither party objected to the circuit court's response. 
Rodriguez's contention that the jury's question suggested the
 
jury was confused about the definition of "terrorize" is purely
 
speculative. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the
 
jury applied anything other than the ordinary and usual meaning
 
of "terrorize." Based on that meaning, the jury could reasonably
 
find that Rodriguez intended to terrorize Kualaau. 
Furthermore, the record does not show that the court's
 
reference back to the jury instructions confused or left an
 
erroneous impression in the minds of the jurors. See State v.
 
Laurie, 56 Haw. 664, 672, 548 P.2d 271, 277 (1976). The jury's
 review of the instructions would have revealed that there was no
 
definition provided for "terrorize." The jury was thereafter
 
able to reach a verdict.
 
Based on the foregoing, Rodriguez failed to rebut the 
presumption that the unobjected-to jury instruction was correct. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i at 337 n.6, 141 P.3d at 984 n.6. 
(2) Next, Rodriguez argues that "there was no
 
substantial evidence to support [his] conviction for Kidnapping,
 
either as the primary or accomplice where neither [he] nor Bailey
 
restrained [Kualaau] with the intent to terrorize him." At most,
 
Rodriguez contends, the jury could only find him guilty of the
 
lesser included offense of Unlawful Imprisonment in the Second
 
7
Degree,  which does not require a finding of an "intent to
terrorize." 
"'Substantial evidence' as to every material element of
 
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient
 
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
 
7
 Pursuant to HRS § 707-722(1) (1993 Repl.), "[a] person commits the
offense of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree if the person knowingly
restrains another person."

caution to support a conclusion." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 
19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). Regarding intent, our courts 
have long held that intent can be proven inferentially:
 
The law recognizes the difficulty by which
intent is proved in criminal cases. We have
consistently held that since intent can rarely
be proved by direct evidence, proof by
circumstantial evidence and reasonable
 inferences arising from circumstances
surrounding the act is sufficient to establish
the requisite intent. Thus, the mind of an
alleged offender may be read from his acts,
conduct, and inferences fairly drawn from all
the circumstances.
 
State v. Sadino, 64 Haw. 427, 430, 642 P.2d 534, 536–37
(1982) (citations omitted).
 
State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai' i 494, 502-503, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188-89 
(2012). 
Rodriguez asserts that Kualaau's testimony was not 
credible, so should not be considered as "substantial evidence." 
We note that "[i]t is well-settled that an appellate court will 
not pass upon issues dependant upon the credibility of witnesses 
and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier 
of fact." State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai' i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 
697 (1999) (citation, internal quotation marks, and some brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai' i 85, 90, 976 P.2d 
399, 404 (1999)). Moreover, the testimony of a single percipient witness may constitute substantial evidence to support a 
conviction. State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 
67 (1996). 
Although Rodriguez testified at trial and argues on
 
appeal that "his only intent was to retrieve the stolen money
 from [Kualaau,]" there was substantial evidence at trial to
 
support the jury's conclusion that Rodriguez intended to
 
terrorize Kualaau. The jury heard not only from Kualaau, but
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from two eyewitnesses who saw Kualaau, with his hands bound
 
behind his back, being thrown by his shoulders and legs into the
 
trunk of the car by the defendants, who then closed the trunk. 
A police officer testified that when he was dispatched to a
 
resident's home, he observed that Kualaau was crying and appeared
 
to be scared. The emergency room physician testified as to
 
Kualaau's bruises and abrasions and a fracture on the nose. 
Rodriguez acknowledged that Kualaau's appearance in the
 
photographs taken at the emergency room was different than his
 
appearance at the beginning of the day.
 
Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there
 
was substantial evidence to support the reasonable inference that
 
Rodriguez acted with the requisite intent to terrorize Kualaau,
 
thereby meeting the statutory definition of Kidnapping.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on March 19, 2012, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
