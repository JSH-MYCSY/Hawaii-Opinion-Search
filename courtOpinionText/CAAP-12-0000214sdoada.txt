IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ADVANCED AIR CONDITIONING, INC.,
Plaintiff-Appellee/Cross-Appellant,
v.
 
GORDON SMITH, Defendant-Appellant/Cross-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC10-1-5773)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Gordon Smith (Smith)
 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order"
 
(FOF/COL) filed on December 30, 2011, and the Judgment filed on
 February 22, 2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division (district court).
1 Smith also challenges the
 
"Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as
 Plaintiff's Claims are Barred by the Statute of Limitations and
 Laches" filed on April 29, 2011, and the district court's denial
 of "Defendant's Motion in Limine as to Plaintiff's Expert Witness
 Cedric Chong's Report Paragraphs 3 and 4."
 
This case arises from Plaintiff-Appellee/Cross-
Appellant Advanced Air Conditioning, Inc.'s (Advanced Air)
 complaint against Smith seeking payment for air conditioning
 materials, labor, and services provided during the construction
 of Smith's home. In the FOF/COL, the district court ordered

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
judgment to be entered in favor of Advanced Air and against Smith
 
in the amount of $17,835, dismissed Smith's counterclaims with
 prejudice, and awarded Advanced Air reasonable attorneys' fees
 and costs. 
In his points of error, Smith contends the district
 
court erred by (1) denying Smith's motion in limine; (2) entering
 its findings of fact (FOF) and conclusions of law (COL) which
 found that Advanced Air completed installation of the air
 conditioning system in April 2005 and thus concluding that
 Advanced Air's claims are not barred by the statute of
 limitations or the doctrine of laches; (3) denying Smith's motion
 for summary judgment; (4) entering judgment in favor of Advanced
 Air; and (5) concluding that Advanced Air did not engage in
 unfair or deceptive trade practices.

Advanced Air cross-appeals from the Judgment and the
 
district court's January 26, 2012 order partially granting
 "[Advanced Air's] Non-Hearing Motion for Attorney's Fees, Costs
 and Prejudgment Interest." Advanced Air contends that the
 district court abused its discretion by (1) denying prejudgment
 interest, and (2) declining to award expert witness costs and all
 of the requested attorneys' fees.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
 parties' points of error as follows and affirm. 
2 Although not directly cited by Smith, it appears that his points of
error challenge FOF nos. 23 and 24, and COL nos. 5, 10-11, 14, and 16.

 Both parties violate Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
28(b)(4) by failing to provide citation to where alleged errors occurred and
where alleged errors were objected to in the Points of Error section of theiropening briefs. "Points not presented in accordance with this section will bedisregarded[.]" HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). "Nonetheless, noncompliance with Rule 28does not always result in dismissal of the claims, and [appellate courts have]consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity tohave their cases heard on the merits, where possible."

Smith's Appeal
(1) Motion in Limine  Smith contends that the district
 
court erred by denying his motion in limine and admitting into
 
evidence two paragraphs from Advanced Air's exhibit 29, a report
 from Advanced Air's expert witness, Cedric Chong (Chong). Smith
 contends that paragraphs 3 and 4 of Chong's report contained
 inadmissible hearsay.
4
 
The district court admitted the report into evidence 
pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 703 over Smith's hearsay objection. "[T]he trial court's decision whether to disallow expert testimony under HRE Rule 703 involves a judgment call and is therefore reviewed for abuse of discretion." Tabieros v. Clark Equipment Co., 85 Hawai
'i 336, 383, 944 P.2d 
1279, 1326 (1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. at 351, 944 P.2d at 1294 (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Smith does not challenge on appeal admission of the 
disputed paragraphs under HRE 703, only asserting that paragraphs 3 and 4 contain hearsay and do not qualify for an exception under HRE Rule 803. Smith thus waives any argument related to HRE 703. Moreover, it appears that paragraphs 3 and 4 were properly admitted under HRE 703. HRE Rule 703 specifically permits expert witnesses to form their opinions based on facts or data that need not be admissible, as long as such evidence is "of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field[,]" and does not indicate a lack of trustworthiness. See Tabieros, 85 
Hawai
'i at 386-87, 944 P.2d at 1329-30 (noting that an expert 
witness may reveal data upon which they have actually and 
4
 Smith also contends that admission of paragraphs 3 and 4 violated the
district court's pre-trial conference order that "[o]ther than a rebuttal
report from an expert on behalf of [Advanced Air], the parties shall not be
allowed to submit any additional evidence or identify any additional
witnesses." Chong was Advanced Air's rebuttal expert witness. Thus, the
district court expressly permitted Advanced Air to submit Chong's report.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonably relied in forming opinions as long as the evidence
 
does not indicate a lack of trustworthiness). Phone calls that
 Chong, a mechanical engineer, had with the project manager appear
 to be evidence "of a type reasonably relied upon" by mechanical
 engineers and the phone calls do not indicate a lack of
 trustworthiness. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its
 discretion. 
(2) Motion for Summary Judgment  Smith contends that
 
the district court erred in denying his motion for summary
 judgment because, even when viewing the evidence in the light
 most favorable to non-movant Advanced Air, Advanced Air's claims
 were barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine of
 laches. 
The appellate courts review "the [trial] court's grant 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 
Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law. . . . The evidence must be viewed in the light most
favorable to the non-moving party. In other words, we must
view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom
 in the light most favorable to the party opposing the
motion.
 
Id. (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 
Hawai'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). Additionally, the 
statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches are both affirmative defenses for which the defendant carries the burden of proof. See Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 8(c); 
U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai 'i 28, 41, 313 P.3d 
717, 730 (2013) ("Generally, the defendant has the burden of proof on all affirmative defenses, which includes the burden of proving facts which are essential to the asserted defense." (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
The statute of limitations for actions to recover any
 
debt founded upon a contract is six years. Hawaii Revised

Statutes (HRS) § 657-1 (1993).5 The contract in this case
 
provided that "[p]ayment will be made promptly upon completion of
 
task." Smith contends that Advanced Air did one-half of the work
 in 2003 and then "walked off the job." Alternatively, Smith
 argues that, even viewing the evidence in the light most
 favorable for Advanced Air, the latest date its work could have
 been completed was in April 2004 before Smith moved into the
 residence, and yet Advanced Air filed suit in May 2010, more than
 six years thereafter. Smith contends that there is no genuine
 issue of material fact because Advanced Air presents no
 substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that installation
 was completed in 2005.
 
In support of his motion for summary judgment, Smith
 
submitted a declaration in which he attested that by late 2003,
 only half of the installation was complete; Advanced Air ignored
 his repeated requests to complete the installation, essentially
 walking off the job; he was forced to hire a new company to
 complete the installation prior to February 2004; he began
 occupancy of the home in April 2004; and he never received a
 final invoice in 2005 from Advanced Air, which in turn, is in no
 way evidence of completion of the installation.
 
In opposing the summary judgment motion, Advanced Air
 
provided the declaration of John Aguada (Aguada), president and
 an owner of Advanced Air, in which he attested that the last work
 performed by Advanced Air was in April 2005, and that it was
 Advanced Air's standard business practice to send a bill upon
 completion of the job and to offer the customer an agreement to
 service the equipment. Submitted with Aguada's declaration were
 the April 2005 invoice and a proposed service maintenance
 contract dated May 25, 2005. The counter evidence submitted by
 Advanced Air raised genuine issues of material fact, including
 when Advanced Air's services were allegedly completed and thus
 
5
 HRS § 657-1 provides in pertinent part that "[a]ctions for the
recovery of any debt founded upon any contract, obligation, or liability,"
must "be commenced within six years next after the cause of action accrued,
and not after[.]"
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
when any alleged breach by Smith occurred. "[I]f the evidence 
presented on the motion is subject to conflicting interpretations, or reasonable men might differ as to its significance, summary judgment is improper." Makila Land Co. v. 
Kapu, 114 Hawai
'i 56, 67, 156 P.3d 482, 493 (App. 2006) (block 
quote format altered; citation omitted). The district court did not err in denying Smith's motion for summary judgment. 
In the alternative, Smith asserts the district court
 
should have granted summary judgment because Advanced Air's
 claims were barred by the doctrine of laches.
6 Assuming a laches
 
argument is appropriate for summary judgment, a party claiming
 laches must demonstrate prejudice from any delay. Adair v.
 
Hustace, 64 Haw. 314, 321, 640 P.2d 294, 300 (1982).
 
Smith asserts that the prejudice suffered is the loss
 
over time of documentation that would demonstrate the statute of
 limitations had lapsed. This argument is without merit. Smith
 points to Advanced Air's inability due to the passage of time to
 produce evidence showing when work was completed. It is unclear
 how this would prejudice Smith, but in any event Advanced Air did
 claim to have evidence showing when work was completed. The only
 lost defense evidence Smith cites is evidence demonstrating he
 had to hire another company to complete installation. Yet, such
 evidence would not necessarily establish the pertinent trigger
 for the statute of limitations, which is breach by Smith due to
 his alleged failure to pay. See Almeida v. Almeida, 4 Haw. App.
 
513, 520, 669 P.2d 174, 180 (1983) ("Generally, the statute of
 limitations does not begin to run on a contract until it is
 breached."). 
The district court did not err in denying Smith's
 
motion for summary judgment.
 
6
 We note that, "[a]lthough a court of equity is not bound by the
statute of limitations, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, it will
usually grant or withhold relief [under the doctrine of laches] in analogy to
the statute of limitations relating to law actions of like character."

internal quotation marks, ellipses and original brackets omitted).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) FOF/COL  Smith contends the record is devoid of
 
substantial evidence supporting the district court's FOF nos. 23
 
and 24, which provide that Advanced Air completed installation in
 April 2005 and did not walk off the job. Smith contends that FOF
 nos. 23 and 24 are clearly erroneous and that COL nos. 10 and 11,
 holding that Advanced Air's claims are not barred by the statute
 of limitations and the doctrine of laches, are wrong. 
"In this jurisdiction, a trial court's FOFs are subject 
to the clearly erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of 
Emps. Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai
'i, 106 Hawai 'i 416, 430, 106 
P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "An FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. [The Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court has] defined 'substantial evidence' as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai
'i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 
1225 (1999) (block quote format altered; citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Smith has not demonstrated that the district court 
clearly erred. The only evidence supporting Smith's contention that Advanced Air walked off the job in 2003 is Smith's own testimony. "[I]t is within the province of the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and this court will refrain from interfering in those determinations." LeMay v. Leander, 92 Hawai
'i 614, 626, 994 P.2d 
546, 558 (2000). It is undisputed that an air conditioning system was installed in Smith's house. The evidence adduced at trial by Advanced Air, including the testimony of Aguada, the final invoice in April 2005, and the proposed maintenance contract in May 2005, support the district court's findings. Moreover, Smith offers no substantive argument against the district court's FOFs that describe the work done by Advanced Air 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the interactions between Advanced Air and Smith upon
 
completion of the installation in 2005. 
Thus, Smith has failed to demonstrate the district
 
court clearly erred in regards to the challenged findings.
(4) Smith's Counterclaim  Smith contends the district
 
court erred when it concluded that Advanced Air did not engage in
 unfair or deceptive trade practices under HRS § 480-2 (2008). 
See COLs 14 and 16. At trial, Smith asserted Advanced Air
 engaged in unfair or deceptive practices by failing to provide
 materials and services as set forth in the contract, and "failing
 to meet industry standards." 
Smith does not dispute the following COLs:
 
12. Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 672E-5 [(Supp.
2013)] requires that a contractor be given 90 days written
notice of any claimed construction defect prior to filing of
a claim against a contractor.
 
13. Smith did not comply with the notice requirements
of the Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 672E-5.
 
. . . .
 
17. There is a basis to dismiss Smith's Counterclaim
 
because it exceeds the statutory limit of HRS Section 604-5
[(Supp. 2013)] and because of Smith's failure to abide by
HRS Section 672E-3 [(Supp. 2013)] and HRS Section 672E-13
[(Supp. 2013)].
 
Unchallenged COLs are binding on this court. Wong v. Cayetano, 
111 Hawai 'i 462, 479, 143 P.3d 1, 18 (2006). Thus, even without 
addressing Smith's substantive arguments, there exists an 
independent basis to affirm the district court's dismissal of Smith's counterclaim. 
Even considering Smith's arguments, Smith's assertion
 
of unfair or deceptive practices was dependant in part on a
 conclusion that Advanced Air breached the contract, yet as noted
 above, Smith failed to demonstrate that Advanced Air walked off
 the job. 
Also, Smith contends that Advanced Air provided a
 
substandard product. In COL no. 5, the district court concluded
 that "[a]ny failure in the air conditioning system to adequately
 cool the house to Smith's satisfaction was the result of Smith's
 failure to cut openings and provide soffits to accommodate the
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ductwork." Smith contends that it was not his duty to perform
 
such actions. 
"A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is 
freely reviewable for its correctness. This court ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard. Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial court's FOFs and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." Chun, 106 Hawai
'i at 430, 106 P.3d at 353 (citations, internal 
quotation marks and original brackets omitted). 
The district court's COL no. 5 was not wrong. The
 
contract called for the "[c]ontractor to provide soffits and
 chase for pipes and duct work as needed." "[T]erms of a contract
 should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary and
 accepted use in common speech, unless the contract indicates a
 different meaning." Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co.,
 
74 Haw. 85, 108, 839 P.2d 10, 24 (1992) (citation and quotation
 marks omitted). 
The contract reflects that it was drafted pursuant to
 
"verbal discussion." Aguada testified that during the pertinent
 verbal discussion, he told David Dolman (Dolman), Smith's project
 manager, that it was Smith's responsibility to provide soffits
 and openings. Although Dolman denied telling Smith specifically
 that Smith was the "contractor" referred to in the contract,
 Dolman verified his discussion with Aguada. Dolman further
 testified that in his experience, the framers hired by the owner
 provide soffits. Dolman handled all negotiations for Smith. Any
 potential failure on the part of Dolman to explain the terms of
 the deal to Smith does not constitute deceptive practices on the
 part of Advanced Air.
 
Smith offers no substantive argument against FOF nos.
 
18 and 19 which provide that, during installation, Advanced Air
 requested that openings be cut and soffits be provided to
 accommodate the ducts, but was told by Smith's on-site supervisor
 that Smith refused to do such work and Advanced Air should make
 the ducts fit within the frame already in place.
 
Smith has not demonstrated the district court erred.

Advanced Air's Cross-Appeal
(1) Prejudgement Interest  Advanced Air contends the
 
district court abused its discretion in denying prejudgment
 
interest despite Smith's failure to pay the amount due under the
 contract for almost seven years. "Prejudgment interest, where
 appropriate, is awardable under HRS § 636-16 [(1993)] in the
 discretion of the trial court." Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at 136, 839
 
P.2d at 36. 
HRS § 636-16 authorizes courts in civil cases to award
 
interest. "The purpose of the statute ... [is] to allow the
 court to designate the commencement date of interest in order to
 correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long period of
 time for any reason, including litigation delays." Amfac, Inc.,
 
74 Haw. at 137, 839 P.2d at 36 (internal quotation marks
 omitted). "[A] trial court can award prejudgment interest for any
 substantial delay in the proceedings, and no purposeful delay on
 the part of the non-moving party is required." Cnty. of Hawaii
 
v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 124 Hawai
'i 281, 312, 242 P.3d 
1136, 1167 (2010) (citation, quotation marks, original brackets and emphasis omitted). Advanced Air does not contend that there was any undue delay during the course of litigation, resting its argument solely on Smith's alleged refusal to pay the $17,835 due under the contract. However, based on our review of the record, at least part of the delay in entering judgment in this case was due to the time it took Advanced Air to file suit.
7 
Advanced Air has not demonstrated that the district
 
court abused its discretion. See Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at 137,
 
839 P.2d at 36 ("Because there is no evidence in the record that
 any of Amfac's conduct unduly delayed the proceedings in this
 case, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion
 in denying [counter-claimant] prejudgment interest.").
 
7
 In 2007, Advanced Air filed a complaint to collect the $17,835 from
Smith but the complaint went unserved. Aguanda also testified at trial that
prior to the 2007 complaint, he explored the option of combining with other
unpaid contractors to pursue Smith in concert. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(2) Costs  Advanced Air contends that the district 
court abused its discretion by failing to award expert witness 
fees. "The [trial] court's grant or denial of attorneys' fees and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai
'i 92, 105, 
176 P.3d 91, 104 (2008) (citation omitted). 
While Advanced Air admits that ordinarily expert
 
witness fees are not awardable as costs, it contends that under
 
8
HRCP Rule 68  courts have awarded expert witness fees, citing
Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Service Center, Inc.
, 89 Hawai 'i 292, 
972 P.2d 295 (1999). Regardless of whether Rule 68 may permit recovery of expert witness fees, we note that Advanced Air acknowledges that it did not make a Rule 68 settlement offer in this case. 
Alternatively, Advanced Air contends that it was unable 
to make a formal Rule 68 settlement offer because Smith disclosed his expert witness opinions one week before trial was originally scheduled to begin. However, Advanced Air cites no authority suggesting that where a Rule 68 settlement offer has not been made, a party may still receive any potential rights afforded to offerors under the rule. Cf. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea 
Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 120, 58 P.3d 608, 631 
(2002) ("[A]n offer that does not satisfy the requirements of [HRCP] Rule 68 does not entitle the offeror to the special benefits of [HRCP] Rule 68." (block quote format altered; citation omitted)). Advanced Air provides no other theory for recovery of expert witness fees. Advanced Air has not demonstrated the district court abused its discretion. 
8
 HRCP Rule 68 provides in pertinent part:
 
At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, any
party may serve upon any adverse party an offer of
settlement or an offer to allow judgment to be taken against
either party for the money or property or to the effect
specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. . . . If
the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more
favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs
incurred after the making of the offer.
 
11
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(3) Attorneys' Fees  Advanced Air contends that the
 
district court abused its discretion by denying the full amount
 
of requested attorneys' fees. 
The statutory basis for attorneys' fees cited by
 
Advanced Air before the district court was HRS § 607-14 (Supp.
 2013).
9 HRS § 607-14 authorizes recovery of reasonable
 
attorneys' fees in all actions in the nature of assumpsit but
 caps recovery at twenty-five percent of the judgment. "[W]here
 the plaintiff prevails on both his complaint and on the
 defendant's counterclaim, the maximum amount of § 607-14
 attorney's fees awardable is computed by applying the schedule to
 the judgment amount in plaintiff's favor and to the amount sued
 for in the counterclaim separately and adding the resulting
 products." Rodrigues v. Chan, 5 Haw. App. 603, 608, 705 P.2d 67,
 
71 (1985). The district court awarded attorneys' fees, as
 
10
requested by Advanced Air's counsel on their claim,  totaling
$10,708.75, twenty-five percent of the judgment ($17,835 x .25 =
 $4,458.75) and twenty-five percent of the amount sued for in
 Smith's counterclaims ($25,000 x .25 = $6,250).
11
 
Advanced Air's only argument that the district court 
abused its discretion is that if Smith had prevailed on his counterclaim, his attorney's fees under HRS § 480-13 (2008) would not have been capped at twenty-five percent of the amount sued for, thus it is unfair to cap Advanced Air's fees. See Cieri v. 
Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Hawai
'i 54, 73, 905 P.2d 29, 48 
(1995) (noting that the amount of attorney fees under HRS § 480­13 awarded to plaintiff's counsel "need not be restricted to the 
9 In its motion for attorneys' fees, Advanced Air also cited HRS § 607­
14.5 (Supp. 2013). HRS § 607-14.5 requires the trial court to make a specific
finding that Smith's claims or defenses were frivolous. The district court
 did not make such a finding. Advanced Air offers no argument that the
district court erred on this basis. 
10 Advanced Air had separate counsel for its claim and its defense to
Smith's counterclaims.
11 Smith asserted damages around $45,000. The district court's
 
jurisdiction was limited to claims not to exceed $25,000. HRS § 604-5 (Supp.
2013). The district court thus limited the total sued for in the counterclaims
to $25,000. 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amount of actual damages.") However, HRS § 480-13 only provides
 
for recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees for plaintiffs who
 obtain judgment in actions brought under HRS Chapter 480. 
Advanced Air cites no authority to support the argument that
 HRS § 480-13 applies to defendants. The only basis for awarding
 attorneys' fees to Advanced Air was HRS § 607-14.
 
Advanced Air has not demonstrated the district court
 
abused its discretion.
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of 
Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order" filed on December 30, 2011, and Judgment entered on February 22, 2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, are affirmed.
