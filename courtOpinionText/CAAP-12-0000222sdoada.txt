SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Solomon Amadeo (Amadeo) appeals
 
from a February 22, 2011 judgment of conviction for (1) Robbery
 
in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 708-841 (Supp. 2012); (2) Kidnapping in violation of HRS
 
§ 707-720 (1993 and Supp. 2012); and (3) Unauthorized Possession
 
of Confidential Personal Information in violation of HRS § 708­
839.55 (Supp. 2012) entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit.1
 
Amadeo raises a single point of error on appeal. He
 
argues that the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney "engaged in
 
prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument by interjecting
 
his personal opinion and attempting to persuade the jury through
 
inappropriate commentary," thereby "den[ying] [Amadeo] of his
 
constitutional right to a fair trial."

After a careful review of the point raised, the
 
arguments presented by counsel, the record and the applicable
 
authority, we resolve Amadeo's point as follows.
 
Hawai'i courts have consistently held that "wide 
latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence" by prosecutors 
during closing arguments. State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 304, 
926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996). "It is not improper for a prosecuting attorney to argue during closing arguments that a defendant's 
testimony was untruthful." State v. Belen, 120 Hawai' i 255, 203 
P.3d 675, No. 28925 2009 WL 418651 at *1 (App. Feb. 20, 2009) (SDO) (citing State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 425, 56 P.3d 
692, 727 (2002)) ("Comments to the effect that a defendant or a defense witness were lying have repeatedly been upheld.") (other 
citations omitted). Furthermore, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
held that "[a] prosecuting attorney may comment on the evidence and the credibility of witness[es] and, in the process, may 
belittle and point to the improbability and untruthfulness of 
specific testimony." Cordeiro at 425, 56 P.3d at 727 (quoting 
Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 305, 926 P.2d at 210). 
"It is generally recognized under Hawai' i case law that 
prosecutors are bound to refrain from expressing their personal 
views as to a defendant's guilt or the credibility of witnesses." 
Id. at 424-25, 56 P.3d at 726-27 (2002) (quoting Clark, 
83 Hawai' i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209). "However, a prosecutor, 
during closing argument, is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude is allowed in 
discussing the evidence." Id. at 425, 56 P.3d at 727 (quoting 
Clark, 83 Hawai' i at 304, 926 P.2d at 209). 
Here, upon review of the prosecutor's argument we
 
conclude that no misconduct occurred. The remarks identified by
 Amadeo, when taken in context of the prosecutor's argument as a
 
whole, including an explicit acknowledgment that it was for the
 
jury to determine the credibility of witnesses, a discussion of
 
the factors the jury had been given to determine the credibility
 
of the witnesses, reminders that it was the jury that needed to

make decisions about what happened in the case and determine
 
which witnesses to believe. The vast bulk of the argument
 
concerned how the evidence supported the charges, discussed the
 
various charges, special interrogatories, and lesser included
 
offenses to which there was no objection at trial nor challenged
 
on appeal. On this record, we conclude that the argument was not
 
improper and, consequently, that Amadeo was not deprived of a
 
fair trial.
 
Therefore, the February 22, 2011 Judgment of the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
