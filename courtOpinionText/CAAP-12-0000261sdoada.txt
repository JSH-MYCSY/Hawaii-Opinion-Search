STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
RONALD IONA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)
(Case No. 1DTA-11-04699)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ronald Iona (Iona) appeals from the
 
Judgment filed on March 1, 2012, in the District Court of the
 
First Circuit (District Court).1 Iona was charged by complaint
 
with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
 (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291E–61(a)(1) (Supp. 2011). Prior to trial, Iona orally moved
 to dismiss the OVUII charge for failure to allege a mens rea. 
The District Court denied the motion. After a bench trial, the
 District Court found Iona guilty as charged. 
On appeal, Iona argues that the District Court erred in 
denying his motion to dismiss because the OVUII charge was deficient for failing to allege a mens rea. In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 53, 61, 276 P.3d 617, 622, 630 (2012), the Hawai' i 
1 The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.

Supreme Court held that a mens rea must be alleged in an OVUII 
charge asserting a violation of HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) in order to provide fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation. Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i concedes error, and we agree 
with that concession. Pursuant to Nesmith, we conclude that Iona's HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) charge was deficient for failing to allege a mens rea. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court's Judgment
 
is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court with
 instructions to dismiss the complaint without prejudice.
