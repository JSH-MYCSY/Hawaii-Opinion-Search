(1) granted summary judgment despite genuine issues of
 
material fact concerning the validity of the mortgage assignment;
 
and 
(2) awarded damages and attorneys' fees and costs
 
without legal authorization. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 26, 2012 "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion For Summary Judgment Filed November
 21, 2011," and the March 9, 2012 "Final Judgment In Favor of
 
Plaintiff And Against Defendants Eleana Umilani Koahou and Yvonne
 
Mokihana Keahi," both entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit are affirmed.
