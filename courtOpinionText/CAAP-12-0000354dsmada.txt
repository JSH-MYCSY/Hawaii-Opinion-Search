 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court construes as responses to the December 1, 2015 Order and 
Orders to Show Cause, the Declaration of Charles R. Prather in Response to the December 29, 2015 Order, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that: 
(1) On May 11, 2012, Appellants filed a Notice of
 
Filing of Bankruptcy, indicating Appellants filed a bankruptcy
 case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
 Hawaii, case number 12-00757, on April 5, 2012;
 
(2) Appellants' bankruptcy case stayed this appeal, 
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) and (3) (2010), and Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 54(c); 
(3) On June 6, 2012, the bankruptcy court filed an
 
order granting Appellee's motion for relief from automatic stay
 in Appellants' bankruptcy case;
 
(4) On July 23, 2012, the bankruptcy court entered a
 
final decree terminating Appellants' bankruptcy case;
 
(5) However, until December 11, 2015, neither party
 
filed notice with this court of the lifting or termination of the
 automatic stay;
 
(6) On December 1, 2015, the court ordered the parties
 
to, among other things, show cause why the appeal should not be
 dismissed for failure to prosecute;
 
(7) Appellants responded that they do not wish to
 
proceed with this appeal, and request the court to dismiss the
 appeal. Appellee does not object to the appeal being dismissed
 for failure to prosecute; and
 
(8) There does not appear to be any reason for this
 
appeal to continue.
