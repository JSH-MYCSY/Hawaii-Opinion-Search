NO. CAAP-12-0000355
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 4642375MO & 4642377MO)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Michael C. Tierney ("Tierney"),
 
appeals 
pro se from the "Order Denying Defendant's Motion Under
 
Rule 60(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure" ("Order
 
Denying Motion"), filed on January 23, 2012, in the District
 Court of the First Circuit ("District Court").
1 The District
 
Court denied Tierney's motion for relief pursuant to Federal
 Rules of Civil Procedure ("FRCP") Rule 60(b) ("Motion") on the
 basis that FRCP Rule 60(b) did not apply to Tierney's cases,
 which were heard in state court and involved criminal traffic
 matters. 
On appeal, Tierney appears to argue that the District
 
Court deprived him of his right to (i) a jury trial, (ii) counsel
 at trial, (iii) confront witnesses, (iv) appeal, and (v) counsel
 on appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tierney's points of error as follows:

Rather than dismissing Tierney's Motion on the basis 
that FRCP Rule 60(b) did not apply, the District Court should 
have treated it as a nonconforming Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 40 petition. See Sparks v. State, No. 
30238, 2012 WL 5834575 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2012) (holding that petitioner's motion should have been treated as an HRPP Rule 40 nonconforming petition); Kekona v. State, No. 30245, 2011 WL 6934912 (Haw. Ct. App. Dec. 29, 2011) (same). 
HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) sets out the criteria for the court
 
to consider when determining whether to treat a nonconforming
 petition as an HRPP Rule 40 petition:
 
NONCONFORMING PETITION. Where a post-conviction petition
deviates from the form annexed to these rules, it shall
nevertheless be accepted for filing and shall be treated as
a petition under this rule provided that the petition (i)
claims illegality of a judgment or illegality of "custody"
or "restraint" arising out of a judgment, (ii) is
accompanied by the necessary filing fee or by a well-founded
request to proceed without paying filing fees, and (iii)
meets minimum standards of legibility and regularity.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(c)(2) (2013).
 
Tierney's Motion meets the criteria for a nonconforming
 
petition under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2). The Motion is legible and
 
claims, in essence, that the judgment was illegal because Tierney
 was denied due process. See Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(a)(1)(i). There
 
has been no indication that Tierney failed to pay, or did not
 qualify for an exemption from paying, the necessary filing fee.
 
HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) sets out the procedure to follow in
 
handling a nonconforming petition under HRPP Rule 40:
 
When treating a nonconforming petition as a petition
under this rule, the court shall promptly clarify by written
order that the requirements of this rule apply and, if the
information in the petition is incomplete, may require the
petitioner to file a supplemental petition in the form
annexed to these rules before requiring the state to
respond.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(c)(2). Thus, the District Court may address
 
any missing information in the nonconforming petition by entering
 an order instructing Tierney to supplement his petition as
 necessary.

Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Denying Motion
 
filed on January 23, 2012, in the District Court of the First
 Circuit is vacated and this case is remanded for the District
 Court to address Tierney's Motion as a nonconforming HRPP Rule 40
 petition.
