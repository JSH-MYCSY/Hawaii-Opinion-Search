(DOCKET NO. AB 2010-211 (K); 4-08-00769)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Employer-Appellant Apex Explosives, LLC and Insurance
 
Carrier-Appellant Hawaii Employer's Mutual Insurance Company,
 
Inc. (HEMIC) (collectively, Apex, unless otherwise stated) appeal
 
from a Decision and Order filed January 4, 2012 (Decision and
 
Order) by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
 
(LIRAB) affirming in part and modifying in part a May 17, 2010
 
decision by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations (the
 
Director) regarding Claimant-Appellee Craig M. McGinnity-Farris's
 
(McGinnity-Farris's) claim for workers' compensation benefits, an
 
Order Denying Request for Reconsideration filed by the LIRAB on
 
March 5, 2012, and an Amended Decision and Order filed by the
 LIRAB on May 14, 2012 (Amended Decision and Order).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. McGinnity-Farris's Work Injury and Subsequent Surgeries
 On June 16, 2008, McGinnity-Farris was employed by Apex
 
when he sustained a right shoulder injury at work. As a result
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the injury, he was not able to work beginning on June 16,
 
2008. 
As his injury did not sufficiently improve, McGinnity-
Farris underwent surgery on his right shoulder on October 14,
 2008 for a subacromial decompression and a repair of the Superior
 Labrum Anterior and Posterior (SLAP) lesion. The surgery was
 
performed by Dr. Floyd Pohlman (Dr. Pohlman). According to Dr.
 
Pohlman's description of the procedure, the surgery involved
 
creating at least two (2) incisions as Dr. Pohlman described the
 closing of "ports" after the surgery.
1 One of these ports was
 
described as a posterior portal.
 
Dr. Pohlman performed another surgery on April 9, 2009,
 
described as a right shoulder arthroscopy, release of the biceps
 tendon, and open biceps tenodesis. Dr. Pohlman's report
 indicated that at least three (3) incisions were made: a
 posterior portal, an anterior portal, and an incision made in the
 axillary line. It was not indicated whether any of these
 incisions were made through any of the scars from the October 14,
 2008 surgery.
 
On April 23, 2009, McGinnity-Farris sustained a non­
work-related exacerbation of his injury when someone fell and grabbed his arm. He sought treatment at Wilcox Memorial Hospital emergency room on that date. On the following day, April 24, 2009, he was treated by physician's assistant Terrie Johnson (Johnson) at Kaua
'i Medical Clinic, and consented to surgery to 
repair the damage done by the re-injury. This surgery took place on April 28, 2009 and was again performed by Dr. Pohlman. The procedure was described as a [right] shoulder arthroscopy with debridement and open biceps tenodesis. Dr. Pohlman's report describes the use of at least four (4) incisions: a posterior

 In medical parlance, a port is "an opening, passage, or channel
through which something can be introduced into the body" such as "an incision
. . . for passing a medical instrument (as an endoscope) into the body."

A "portal" is a "small (e.g. ± 1-cm) incision over a joint to provide access
for arthroscopy." Medical Dictionary, T HEFREEDICTIONARY .COM,

portal, an anterior portal, the re-opening and enlargement of the
 
previous incision made during the tenodesis procedure (presumably
 the incision in the axillary line), and a mid-forearm incision. 
On September 16, 2009, HEMIC notified McGinnity-Farris
 
that it had scheduled an Independent Medical Examination (IME)
 
with Dr. John Sterling Endicott (Dr. Endicott). On December 1,
 
2009, McGinnity-Farris was examined by Dr. Endicott pursuant to
 
the IME request by HEMIC for an Independent Medical Examination
 and Impairment Assessment. In his report on the IME and his
 Impairment Assessment, which was not completed until March 3,
 
2
2010, Dr. Endicott noted the following regarding McGinitty­
Farris's scars: 

The right shoulder shows arthroscopic scars that
are multiple. Anteriorly there is a crossed scar that
is 1.5 cm x 2.5 cm. The lateral scar is 1.5 cm normal
 and flat. The posterior scars are 1.5 cm and 1.0 cm.
There are two larger scars with the superior anterior
scar at 7.5 cm, and the inferior anterior scar 5 cm.
 
According to Dr. Pohlman, McGinnity-Farris was released
 
to a home exercise program as of October 6, 2009, he achieved
 
maximum medical improvement as of October 12, 2009, and was
 cleared to return to work as early as October 13, 2009. This
 report was sent to HEMIC's claim adjuster, Rose PeBenito
 (PeBenito), on October 12, 2009. 
B. Procedural History
 As a result of his work injury, McGinnity-Farris was
 
paid temporary total disability (TTD) benefits by HEMIC at a rate
 
of $392.02 per week from June 20, 2008 through October 29, 2009
 
for a total of $27,833.42. He was also compensated for medical
 costs associated with his injury in the total of $25,758.74. 
Promptly after receiving Dr. Pohlman's report, but
 
while the IME and a report from Dr. Endicott was still pending,
 HEMIC sent a letter dated October 15, 2009 to McGinnity-Farris
 and the State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations
 (DLIR), indicating that TTD benefits would be terminated as of
 
October 29, 2009 and notifying them that HEMIC would be

 On February 19, 2010, HEMIC wrote to Dr. Endicott noting that his
report was overdue and requested that he forward the report.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requesting a credit for overpayment of TTD benefits paid after
 
October 13, 2009. 
Shortly after receiving Dr. Endicott's report of his
IME and Impairment Assessment, which was dated March 3, 2010,
 HEMIC sent a letter dated March 12, 2010 notifying McGinnity-
Farris and the DLIR hearings officer that it would be seeking
 credit and/or reimbursement for overpayment of TTD benefits paid
 out from April 23, 2009 to October 29, 2009 in the amount of
 $10,640.54 and for medical care benefits paid as of April 23,
 2009. 

 
A hearing was held before a hearing officer of the
 
DLIR, Disability Compensation Division on March 18, 2010.
 Thereafter, the Director issued an initial decision on May 17,
 2010 (Director's Decision) and later, an amended decision on June
 
3, 2010 (Director's Amended Decision), which was based on certain  
 
errors alleged by HEMIC in a May 20, 2010 Request for
 
Reconsideration. The Director's Amended Decision, with notations
 added to point out the differences between it and the original
 Director's Decision, includes the following:
 
1. Sections 386-21 and 386-26, HRS, said employer shall pay
for such medical care, services, and supplies as the nature
of the injury may require up to 4/22/2009. [original
decision did not list a date]
 
2. Section 386-31(b), HRS, said employer shall pay to
claimant weekly compensation of $392.02 for temporary total
disability from work beginning (waiting period: 6/17/2008
through 6/19/2008) 6/20/2008 through 4/22/2009 for 43.8571
weeks, for a total of $17,192.88.
 
3. Section 386-32(a), HRS, said employer shall pay to
claimant weekly compensation of $392.02 for 11% permanent
partial disability of the arm, beginning 4/23/2009 for
137.2800 weeks, for a total of $23,886.72.
 
4. Section 386-32(a), HRS, said employer shall pay to
claimant one lump sum of $550.00 for disfigurement as
follows: three (3) scars: One (1) 2-inch hyperpigmented,
linear, scar on right upper arm, one (1) 1/2-inch
hyperpigmented, linear, scar on posterior shoulder, and one
(1) 2-inch hyperpigmented, linear, scar on anterior
shoulder.
 
5. Section 386-52, HRS, employer is authorized to credit of
$10,640.54 for temporary total disability benefits paid from
4/23/2009 through 10/29/2009 against the award for permanent
partial disability benefits.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 27, 2010, McGinnity-Farris sent a letter to the
 
DLIR appealing the Director's Decision. 
After an initial conference, the LIRAB issued a
 
pretrial order setting a trial for August 17, 2011, before the
 
LIRAB in Honolulu. The order narrowed the issues to be
 determined at trial to the following:
 
a. Whether Employer is liable for, and Claimant entitled to,
medical care, services, and supplies after April 22, 2009.
 
b. Whether Claimant is entitled to temporary total
disability after April 22, 2009.
 
c. What is the extent of permanent partial disability
resulting from the work injury of June 16, 2008.
 
d. What is the extent of disfigurement resulting from the
work injury of June 16, 2008.
 
e. Whether Employer is entitled to a credit against
permanent partial disability for temporary total disability
benefits paid for the period April 23, 2009 through October
29, 2009 in the amount of $10,640.94.
 
The parties stipulated that neither would be presenting
 
witnesses and waived their rights to appear in person at the
 
trial, but they reserved the right to submit their respective
 position memoranda and briefs by October 3, 2011. This
 stipulation was approved on August 30, 2011. Each party timely
 
submitted their post-trial memoranda. 
The LIRAB issued its Decision and Order on January 4,
 
2012. The LIRAB credited Dr. Endicott's description of
 
McGinnity-Farris's scars as an accurate description of the scars
 resulting from the work injury and increased the disfigurement
 award to $1,000. In addition, the LIRAB held in Conclusion of
 Law (COL) 5 that Apex was not entitled to credit against
 
permanent partial disability (PPD) for TTD benefits paid for the
 
entire period of April 23, 2009 through October 29, 2009 in the
 
amount of $10,640.94.
3 Specifically, it held that: "Despite
 
being aware of the potentially subsequent intervening event of
 April 23, 2009 as early as May 1, 2009, Employer did not provide
 Claimant notice of its intent to seek credit for any overpayments
 
3
 As indicated below, the October 29, 2009 date was later amended to
October 13, 2009.
 
5
   
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of temporary total disability benefits on this basis until March
 
12, 2010." However, the LIRAB held that Apex was entitled to a
 credit for TTD benefits paid from October 13, 2009 through
 October 29, 2009.
4
 
On February 3, 2012, Apex timely filed a Request for
 
Reconsideration of the January 4, 2012 Decision and Order
 disputing the increase of the disfigurement award and the denial
 of credit for the overpayment of TTD benefits from April 23, 2009
 through October 29, 2009.
5
 
The LIRAB issued its Order Denying Request for
 
Reconsideration on March 5, 2012. The LIRAB declined to disturb
 its increase of the disfigurement award, stating: 
[T]he reports of the first two surgeries note five incisions
or portal points, not three, as argued by Employer. The
 third surgery that Claimant underwent included an incision
to his mid forearm, which was not identified in the shoulder
area scars described by Dr. Endicott, and which was not
included in the disfigurement description by the Board. 
 
Additionally, the LIRAB held "[w]ith regard to the issue of
 
Employer's credit, the Board does not adopt the reasoning posed
 by Employer. The cases cited by Employer are distinguishable." 
Apex timely appealed the Decision and Order and the
 
March 5, 2012 Order Denying Request for Reconsideration on April
 3, 2012. 
The LIRAB issued an Amended Decision and Order on May
 
14, 2012 for the purpose of correcting certain typographical
 errors. Relevant to this appeal, the LIRAB corrected its COL 5
 to read: "The Board concludes that Employer is not entitled to a
 credit against permanent partial disability for temporary total
 disability benefits paid for the period April 23, 2009 through
October 13, 2009 in the amount of $10,640.94." The LIRAB amended
 
additional language in the same COL to read: "The Board
 
concludes, however, that Employer is entitled to a credit against

 As indicated below, the October 13, 2009 date was later amended to
October 14, 2009.

 Under Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-53, the LIRAB may,
at the request of any party, reconsider or reopen its decision within thirty
days after mailing a copy of its decision or order.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
permanent partial disability for temporary total disability
 
benefits paid for the period October 14, 2009 through October 29,
 
2009." 
Apex timely appealed from the Amended Decision and
 
Order to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) on May 29, 2012. 
On July 11, 2012, Apex filed an "Amended Notice of Appeal" which
 
clarified that Apex sought to consolidate its appeals from the
 LIRAB's January 4, 2012 Decision and Order, the March 5, 2012
 Order Denying Request for Reconsideration, and the May 14, 2012
 Amended Decision and Order. 
II.	 POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL
 
Apex contends that the LIRAB erred when it: (1)
 
increased the Director's initial disfigurement award from $550 to
 $1,000, a difference of $450; (2) denied Apex's credit against
 PPD for TTD benefits paid for the period of April 23, 2009
 through October 13, 2009.
 III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Judicial review of a LIRAB decision and order is
 
governed by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(g) (1993). 
Duque v. Hilton Hawaiian Vill.,  105 Hawai 'i 433, 437, 98 P.3d 
640, 644 (2004). HRS § 91-14(g) states:
 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that: 
Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions are reviewable under
subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding
procedural defects are reviewable under subsection (3);
findings are reviewable under subsection (5); and an 
7

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agency's exercise of discretion is reviewable under subsection
(6). 
The courts may freely review an agency's conclusions
of law. The LIRAB's conclusions will be reviewed de novo,
under the right/wrong standard.
 
An agency's findings are reviewable under the clearly
erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision was
clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence on the whole record. An agency's
findings are not clearly erroneous and will be upheld if
supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence
unless the reviewing court is left with a firm and definite
conviction that a mistake has been made. 
Tauese v. State, Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations, 113 Hawai 'i 
1, 25, 147 P.3d 785, 809 (2006) (citations, internal quotation
 
marks, and brackets omitted). 
"Statutory interpretation is a question of law
 
reviewable de novo." First Ins. Co. of Haw. v. A & B Props., 126
 
Hawai'i 406, 414, 271 P.3d 1165, 1173 (2012) (quoting State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009)). With 
respect to review of an agency's interpretation of a statute, the
 supreme court has held that: 
Where an administrative agency is charged with the
responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a statute
which contains words of broad and indefinite meaning, courts
accord persuasive weight to administrative construction and
follow the same, unless the construction is palpably
erroneous.
 
Stated differently:
 
Where an agency is statutorily responsible for
carrying out the mandate of a statute which contains broad
or ambiguous language, that agency's interpretation and
application of the statute is generally accorded judicial
deference on appellate review. However, an interpretation by
an agency of a statute it administers is not entitled to
deference if the interpretation is plainly erroneous and
inconsistent with both the letter and intent of the
 statutory mandate.

IV. DISCUSSION

 
A. The Disfigurement Award
 
Apex contends that the LIRAB erred by increasing the
 
Director's disfigurement award from $550 to $1000, a difference
 of $450. More specifically, it contends that the LIRAB erred by
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
basing its increased award on Dr. Endicott's description of
 
McGinnity-Farris's scars.
 
The LIRAB disagreed with the Director's conclusion that
 
Apex was liable for only three of McGinnity-Farris's scars and
 modified the order accordingly. 
While HRS § 386-32(a) (Supp. 2013) provides a great 
deal of discretion, the LIRAB may not grant compensation under a worker's compensation statute unless the injury arises out of and in the course of employment. Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co., 77 
Hawai
'i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 1246, 1249 (1994). Here, the LIRAB 
determined that McGinnity-Farris's April 23, 2009 injury "was an independent, intervening event that did not relate back to his original, June 16, 2008 work injury." Thus, the LIRAB determined the injury on April 23, 2009 "terminated Employer's liability for workers' compensation benefits for the June 16, 2008 work injury," such that "Employer is not liable for, and Claimant not entitled to, medical care, services, and supplies after April 22, 2009." Therefore, the LIRAB could not grant disfigurement awards for scarring incurred because of the April 28, 2009 surgery, as it was not the result of a work injury. 
It appears, however, that the LIRAB determined that all
 
of the scars described by Dr. Endicott (a total of at least
 
6
six) , rather than the three scars described by the Director,
could be attributed to the workplace injury. Dr. Endicott's IME
 report does not support this finding.
 
The LIRAB recognized that Dr. Pohlman's descriptions of
 
the first two surgeries note five incisions.
7 We are unable to
 
6
 Seven scars if the "crossed scar" is actually taken to mean two
different scars that form a cross. 
7
 Apex argues that Dr. Pohlman described only three incision points,
apparently missing Dr. Pohlman's description of an incision made in the
axillary line and the creation of an anterior portal during the second
surgery. The Director's findings listed three scars resulting from the
surgery, and Apex argues that the LIRAB should have relied on this finding as
the most reliable evidence on record. This finding suggests that at least two
of Dr. Pohlman's incisions during the second surgery were made over scars
created during the second surgery. However, the LIRAB reviews the Director's
decision de novo and need not adopt the Director's findings. HRS § 386-87(b),
(c) (1993). 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
discern how the LIRAB then credited Dr. Endicott's report, which 
not only lists six or seven different scars, but also does not address which scars could be attributed to the work-related versus non-work-related surgeries. Even accepting the LIRAB's determination that Dr. Endicott did not list the forearm incision caused by the third surgery, the third surgery included at least three additional shoulder incisions that Dr. Endicott could have included among his list of arthroscopic shoulder scars. Thus, as the record does not support a finding that all scars described in Dr. Endicott's IME report were attributable to the work injury, such a finding was clearly erroneous. Tauese, 113 Hawai
'i at 25, 
147 P.3d at 809. 
Accordingly, the disfigurement award is vacated and
 
remanded to the LIRAB for further findings concerning which scars
 can be attributed to the first two surgeries and a determination
 of the disfigurement award based on such findings.
 
B. Credit for TTD Benefits
 
Apex argues that the LIRAB erred in denying credit
 
against PPD benefits for TTD benefits paid from April 23, 2009
 through October 13, 2009.
 
HRS § 386-52(a) (1993) provides, in relevant part:
 
(a) Any payments made by the employer to the injured
employee during the employee's disability or to the
employee's dependents which by the terms of this chapter
were not payable when made, shall be deducted from the
amount payable as compensation subject to the approval of
the director; provided that:
 
(1) The employer notifies the injured employee and the
director in writing of any such credit request stating
the reasons for such credit and informing the injured
employee that the employee has the right to file a
written request for a hearing to submit any evidence
to dispute such a credit;
 
(2) The deduction shall be made by shortening the
period during which the compensation must be paid, or
by reducing the total amount for which the employer is
liable and not the amount of weekly benefits;
 
(3) If overpayment cannot be credited, the director
shall order the claimant to reimburse the employer.
Failure to reimburse the employer shall entitle the
employer to file for enforcement of such a decision in
accordance with section 386-91.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On October 15, 2009, HEMIC claim specialist PeBenito
 
sent a letter to McGinnity-Farris and the DLIR which read as
 
follows:
 
At this time, we are giving notice to you that
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes Sections 386-31, 386-31
[sic], 386-33, and 386-52, we are requesting a credit for
the overpayment of temporary disability benefits as of
October 13, 2009 onward against the award for permanent
disability. Also, we are advising you that weekly benefits
that we are currently paying to you will be terminated as of
October 29, 2009. However, if payments are to be paid after
October 29, 2009, they too will be a credit on the permanent
disability to be awarded to you for the following reasons:
 
•
	 On September 17, 2009, you completed a Functional
Capacity Evaluation (FCE). The results of the FCE
 were that you are able to return to work at the light
duty level, 8 hours a day.
 
•	 On October 4, 2009, physical therapy was completed and
you were released to return to work.
 
•	 On October 12, 2009, you were seen by the attending
physician, Dr. Floyd Pohlman, and Patricia Willet, RN.
Ms. Willet has advised us that Dr. Pohlman has
 reviewed the FCE results with you, released you to
return to work, determined that you are at maximum
medical improvement and no further office visits are
planned.
 
•	 It is our understanding that you intend on returning
to work in a self-employment capacity and will be
opening a flower shop at the Kauai Hilton Hotel.
 
If you believe that I have overlooked something or
misunderstand the opinions of Dr. Pohlman, please let me
know. If you disagree with our termination of the weekly
temporary total disability benefits and our request for
credit, you may request a hearing before the Dept. of Labor,
Disability Compensation Division. 
  
On March 12, 2010, nine days after the date of Dr.
 
Endicott's IME and Impairment Assessment report, PeBenito sent
 
another letter to both McGinnity-Farris and DLIR hearings officer
 Aric T. Fujii, which read in part:
 
At this time, we are giving notice to Mr. McGinity-
Faris [sic] that pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
Sections 386-21, 386-31, 386-32, 386-33 and 386-52, we are
requesting a credit and/or reimbursement for the overpayment
of temporary total disability benefits as of April 23, 2009
through October 29, 2009 in the amount of $10,64054 [sic]
and medical care benefits incurred and paid as of April 23,
2009 to the present in the amount of $4,959.19 against the
awards for permanent partial disability and disfigurement.
Our position is based on the following reasons:
 
•
	 Mr. McGinity Farris was involved in a subsequent non­
industrial accident and injury to his right shoulder
and right upper extremity on April 23, 2009.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
•	 Dr. John Endicott, in his report dated March 3, 2010,
opined that the April 23, 2009 incident was a
permanent aggravation of the post-operative
complication and caused the need for the third surgery
on April 23,2 009 [sic] (see pages 18 to 19 of Dr.
Endicott's report). Dr. Endicott opined that the
failure of the second tenodesis attempt was due to the
non-industrial permanent aggravation that occurred on
April 28,2 009 [sic] (see page 19 of Dr. Endicott's
report). Dr. Endicott opined that the restrictions
from working were also due to the non-industrial
permanent aggravation that occurred on April 23, 2009
(see page 21 of Dr. Endicott's report).
 
Therefore, we believe that the subsequent intervening
permanent aggravation that occurred on April 23, 2009
resulted in the need for Mr. McGinity-Farris' [sic] further
medical care and temporary disability form [sic] work.
 
If Mr. McGinity-Farris [sic] disagrees with our
request for credit and/or reimbursement as requested above,
he may request a hearing before the Department of Labor,
Disability Compensation Division. 
 
As revised by its Amended Decision and Order, the
 
LIRAB's COL 5 reads:
 
The Board concludes that Employer is not entitled to a
credit against permanent partial disability for temporary
total disability benefits paid for the period April 23, 2009
through October [13], 2009 in the amount of $10,640.94. 
Despite being aware of the potentially subsequent
intervening event of April 23, 2009 as early as May 1, 2009,
Employer did not provide Claimant notice of its intent to
seek credit for any overpayments of temporary total
disability benefits on this basis until March 12, 2010.
The Board concludes, however, that Employer is
entitled to a credit against permanent partial disability
for temporary total disability benefits paid for the period
of October [14], 2009 through October 29, 2009.
 
 
The determination that Apex was aware of McGinnity­
Farris's re-injury as early as May 1, 2009 comes from the LIRAB's
 
FOF 10 which says: 
On April 24, 2009, Claimant saw physician's assistant
Terrie Johnson. Ms. Johnson noted that Claimant had been
 
"doing very well until a few days ago, when a friend of his
was starting to fall and she reached out and grabbed his
arm, pulling on his operative arm and pulling the repair
apart." Claimant was admitted for "refixation of the biceps
tenodesis."
 
The evidence indicates that Employer received Ms.
Johnson's treatment note on May 1, 2009. 
The record includes Johnson's April 24, 2009 note,
 
along with the copy of an envelope addressed to HEMIC from the
 
Kaua'i Medical Clinic postmarked April 30, 2009. The treatment

note and the envelope are marked by time stamps reading
 
"05/01/2009 01:14 PM."
 
The LIRAB's COL 5 effectively concludes that HEMIC's 
October 13, 2009 letter provided reasonable notice under HRS § 386-52(a), but its March 12, 2010 letter did not. Apex argues that the LIRAB's interpretation of HRS § 386-52(a) to require an element of timeliness was error as no such requirement is included in the statute. This issue of statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo. First Ins. Co. of 
Haw., 126 Hawai
'i at 414, 271 P.3d at 1173. 
HRS § 386-52(a) does not expressly contain a timeliness
 
requirement, nor does a review of case law show that appellate
 courts have addressed the issue.
8 We conclude that the LIRAB
 
correctly determined that an employer who seeks a credit or
 reimbursement pursuant to HRS § 386-52(a) must give the required
 notice within a reasonable period of time.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held: 
When the legislative intent [of a statute] is less
than clear, however, this court will observe the well
established rule of statutory construction that, where an
administrative agency is charged with the responsibility of
carrying out the mandate of a statute which contains words
of broad and indefinite meaning, courts accord persuasive
weight to administrative construction and follow the same,
unless the construction is palpably erroneous.
 
The rule of judicial deference, however, does not
apply when the agency's reading of the statute contravenes
the legislature's manifest purpose. Consequently, we have
not hesitated to reject an incorrect or unreasonable
statutory construction advanced by the agency entrusted with
the statute's implementation. 
In re Water Use Permit Applications, 105 Hawai 'i 1, 9, 93 P.3d 
643, 651 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; 
block quote format altered). 
The language of HRS § 386-52(a) is broad, indefinite,
 
and ambiguous as to when notice should be given; it neither
 provides a deadline for notice nor expressly says that notice may
 be given at any time. Further, the legislative intent as to when
 
8
 We note that HAR § 12-10-24 requires notice to be given at a
certain time; however, this rule appears to be applicable only when an
employer seeks credit for advance payments made in lieu of compensation. 
13
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
notice must be given is unclear. A review of the legislative 
history of Act 66 of 1979 (1979 Haw. Sess. Laws, Reg. Sess., Act 66, § 2 at 139) which birthed the notice requirement of HRS § 386-52(a) shows an intent to require an employer to give timely notice before the termination of TTD benefits, but is silent as to whether timely notice was intended to be required for requests for credit.
9 Thus, the LIRAB's interpretation should be accorded 
persuasive weight unless it is palpably erroneous. Haole, 111 
Hawai'i at 150, 140 P.3d at 383. For the reasons set forth 
below, the LIRAB's interpretation is not palpably erroneous. 
Where a time frame for notice is not provided for in 
the statute, a requirement that notice must be given in a reasonable time may be imported. Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. 
Befitel, 104 Hawai
'i 412, 420, 91 P.3d 494, 502 (2004). Without 
such a requirement, the plain language of HRS § 386-52(a) would allow an employer to request credit no matter how much time has passed since payments were made. As HRS § 386-52(a)(3) provides that when credit cannot be given, reimbursement shall be ordered, allowing an employer to unreasonably delay notice could result in prejudice to an injured employee. Thus, the LIRAB did not err by interpreting HRS § 386-52(a) to require an employer to give

 Specifically, the committee reports regarding Act 66 only refer to
the intent to require timely notice with respect to the termination of TTD
benefits.
 
The purpose of this bill is to provide a means to

settle disputes when temporary total disability benefits are
stopped.
. . . . 
This bill would require the employer who ceases

payment of temporary total disability benefits to an injured
employee . . . to notify the employee and the Director of
the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations in writing
of such termination at least two weeks before the last
 payment is made. The notification shall state the reason
 for termination of benefits and that if the employee is of
the opinion that the employer unlawfully terminated
benefits, the employee may make a written request to the
department for a hearing.

reasonable notice that the employer would seek credit or
 
reimbursement for TTD overpayments. 
The next issue is whether the LIRAB erred in 
determining that the March 12, 2010 letter did not provide notice within a reasonable time. A determination of reasonableness is generally a question of fact when there are factual issues to be determined; however, once factual issues are resolved or the facts are open to only one reasonable inference, it becomes a question of law. Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc., 104 Hawai
'i at 420, 
91 P.3d at 502 (holding that the DLIR and circuit court's determination that the DLIR's delay in giving a notice of violation two years after the completion of an investigation was reasonable was a conclusion of law); Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 107-08, 839 P.2d 10, 23-24 (1992); see also Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. ContextMedia, Inc., __ F. Supp. 2d __, No. 12-cv-9975, 2014 WL 4269062 at *6, (N.D. Ill.
 Aug. 28, 2014) (whether notice of an occurrence which could
 result in a claim was given to an insurer within a reasonable
 time is dependent on the facts of each case, but is a question of
 law where the material facts are not in dispute).
 
Here, the LIRAB's determination relied entirely on the
 
fact that Apex was "aware of the potentially subsequent
 intervening event of April 23, 2009" as early as May 1, 2009,
 based on the date of a physician assistant's treatment note, and
 therefore was not entitled to a credit for the April 23, 2009 to
 October 13, 2009 TTD payments. We conclude that this fact, as a
 matter of law, was insufficient to show that the employer's
 notice was unreasonable. Given the circumstances described by
 the LIRAB, we cannot conclude, as a matter or law, that it was
 unreasonable for the employer to await a report by a licensed
 physician before discontinuing benefits and/or seeking credit or
 reimbursement for overpayment of benefits. As evidenced by the
 LIRAB's Decision and Order, Dr. Endicott's IME and Impairment
 Assessment report was critical to the LIRAB's own determination
 of McGinnity-Farris's impairment as a result of the work accident
 and the effect of the April 23, 2009 non-industrial injury. It
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appears that the employer discontinued future TTD payments based
 
on Dr. Pohlman's October 12, 2009 report, but awaited the results
 of Dr. Endicott's IME, which was already scheduled when Dr.
 Pohlman's report was received, before seeking credit against PPD
 for the earlier TTD payments.
 
As noted above, when Dr. Endicott's report had not been
 
received by mid-February, HEMIC notified Dr. Endicott that the
 report was overdue and requested that he rectify the matter. 
Within roughly one week of receiving Dr. Endicott's IME report
 dated March 3, 2010, notice was given to McGinnity-Farris that
 the employer sought credit for the April 23, 2009 to October 13,
 2009 TTD overpayments. The LIRAB does not refer to any evidence
 in the record of prejudice to McGinnity-Farris resulting from the
 delayed notice that a reduction in PPD payments was being
 requested as a result of this overpayment. Under these
 circumstances, we conclude that the LIRAB erred in relying solely
 on Apex's receipt of the physician assistant's note in
 determining that the employer's notice was unreasonable and,
 therefore, that Apex was not entitled to a credit against PPD for
 TTD benefits paid for the period April 23, 2009 through October
 13, 2009.
 V. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate, to the extent set
 
forth herein, the LIRAB's January 4, 2012 Decision and Order, as
 amended by the May 14, 2012 Amended Decision and Order; we remand
 this case to the LIRAB for further proceedings consistent with
 this Memorandum Opinion.
