IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ARNOLD SABALA, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-11-056589)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Arnold Sabala, Jr. (Sabala) appeals 
from the March 5, 2012 Judgment in Case No. 1DTC-11-056589 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division 
(District Court).1 Sabala was orally charged with Reckless 
Driving in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291-2 
(2007) and Excessive Speeding in violation of HRS § 291C­
105(a)(1) (2007) occurring on August 4, 2011. After a bench 
trial, Sabala was acquitted of Reckless Driving and was convicted 
as charged of Excessive Speeding. 
On appeal, Sabala raises the following points of error. 
The District Court (1) plainly erred in convicting him on a 
charge that lacked 
mens rea, and (2) erred in admitting, over 
objection, laser speed reading evidence without a proper 
foundation of officer training and qualification.

 The Honorable Clyde Sumida presided.

The State fails to advance any argument on mens rea,
 
although it concedes that insufficient evidence existed of the
 
foundation for admission of the laser speed reading, requiring
 
reversal of the judgment.
 
Despite the concession, the court must nevertheless 
determine that such concession is sound. State v. Wasson, 76 
Hawai'i 415, 418, 879 P.2d 520, 523 (1994) (citing Territory v. 
Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (1945) ("even when the prosecutor 
concedes error, before a conviction is reversed, 'it is incumbent 
on the appellate court to ascertain first that the confession of 
error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and to 
determine that such error is properly preserved and 
prejudicial.'") 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Sabala's appeal as follows.
 
As to the first point of error, in State v. Gonzalez, 
128 Hawai' i 314, 288 P.3d 788 (2012), where a motion to dismiss 
the charge for lack of mens rea was made at trial, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court recently held that the offense of Excessive Speeding in violation of HRS § 291C-105(a) "is not a strict 
liability offense and requires proof that the defendant acted 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. Thus, the requisite 
states of mind must be alleged in a charge of this offense." 
Gonzalez 128 Hawai' i at 314-15, 288 P.3d at 789; see also State 
v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 56, 276 P.3d 617, 625 (2012) (holding 
that the failure to allege a mens rea in charging the offense of 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) rendered the charge insufficient 
because the charge failed "to alert the defendants of precisely 
what they needed to defend against to avoid a conviction."). The

HRS § 291C-105(a). Gonzalez
, 128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d at 
798.
 
Where Sabala raises the sufficiency of the complaint
 
for the first time on appeal, the liberal construction rule
 
applies.
 
Under the Motta/Wells[3] post-conviction liberal construction
rule, we liberally construe charges challenged for the first
time on appeal. Under this approach, there is a presumption
of validity for charges challenged subsequent to a
conviction. In those circumstances, this court will not
reverse a conviction based upon a defective indictment or
complaint unless the defendant can show prejudice or that
the indictment or complaint cannot within reason be
construed to charge a crime.
 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 399–400, 219 P.3d 1170, 
1186–87 (2009) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets 
omitted). 
Sabala does not state how he was prejudiced by the 
omission of mens rea from the charge. Nevertheless, it does not 
appear that the excessive speeding charge can within reason be 
construed to charge a crime absent mens rea. The companion 
charge of Reckless Driving may be utilized to determine if the 
Excessive Speeding charge can be construed to include mens rea 
consistent with State v. Tominiko, 126 Hawai' i 68, 75-77 266 P.3d 
1122, 1129-31 (2011) (in liberal construction of the charge of 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant where 
"public road" language was omitted, the companion charge of 
driving without motor vehicle insurance which was dismissed prior 
to trial, involved the same incident, and contained reference to

 HRS § 702-204 (1993) states that "[w]hen the state of mind
required to establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law,
that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly."

 State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 92-94, 657 P.2d 1019, 1021-22 (1983); 
and State v. Wells, 78 Hawai' i 373, 379-80, 894 P.2d 70, 76-77 (1995).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a public roadway was sufficient to provide notice that the OVUII
 
charge occurred on a public roadway). However, it appears that
 
the mens rea in Reckless Driving by operating a vehicle in
 
conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of
 
4
the safety of persons or property  is different from the mens rea
 in Excessive Speeding by operating a vehicle with conscious
 
disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of exceeding
 
the speed limit in excess 30 miles per hour or more.
5 Thus,
 
awareness of the reckless driving mens rea does not necessarily
 
inform a person of the excessive speeding mens rea.
 
Accordingly, because the Excessive Speeding charge 
under HRS § 291C-105(a)(1), as alleged against Sabala in this 
case, failed to state the requisite state of mind, the March 5, 
2012 Judgment should be vacated and the case remanded to the 
District Court for dismissal without prejudice. See Gonzalez, 
128 Hawai' i 314-315, 288 P.2d 788, 789. We need not reach the 
remaining point of error advanced by Sabala. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the March 5, 2012 Judgment 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, ' Ewa Division 
4 HRS § 291-2; see State v. Agard, 113 Hawai' i 321, 328-29, 151 P.3d 
802, 809-10 (2007) (the facts in connection with the mens rea for reckless 
driving demonstrated that the Respondent "disregarded the safety of persons orproperty, [State v.] Bui, 104 Hawai' i [462,] 467, 92 P.3d [471,] 476 [(2004)]
(citations omitted), and that such circumstances, [State v.] Eastman, 81Hawai'i [131,] 141, 913 P.2d [57,] 67 [(1996)], reasonably demonstrate that
Respondent's disregard of the risk to others was conscious and 'involve[d] agross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law abiding person wouldobserve in the same situation,' HRS § 702-206(3)(d)") (footnote omitted).
