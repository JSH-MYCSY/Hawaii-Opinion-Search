NO. CAAP-12-0000359
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SHANE FLORES, Defendant-Appellant, and
FLOYD ORSBORN and ROBERT LOGSDON, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0591)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginzoa, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Shane Flores (Flores) timely
 
appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence, which was
 
entered on March 30, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court),1
 for Kidnapping in violation of Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-720(1)(e) (Supp. 2012); Ownership orPossession Prohibited of Any Firearm or Ammunition by a Person
 
Convicted of Certain Crimes in violation of HRS § 134-7(b) & (h)
(2011) (Felon in Possession); Carrying or Possessing a Loaded
 
Firearm on a Public Highway in violation of HRS § 134-26 (2011);
and Possession of a Prohibited Detachable Ammunition Magazine in

 
  
 
violation of HRS § 134-8(c) & (d) (2011).
 
Flores argues that the Circuit Court erred by: 
(1)
 
denying his motion to dismiss Count 13 based on the failure of
 the indictment to charge the requisite mens rea; (2) denying his

motion to dismiss Count 15 based on the failure of the indictment
 
to charge the requisite mens rea; (3) denying his motion to
 
dismiss Count 16 based on the failure of the indictment to charge
 
the requisite mens rea; and (4) refusing to instruct the jury on
 
unlawful imprisonment in the first degree as a lesser included
 
offense to the kidnapping charge in violation of Flores's
 
constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel and to
 
present a defense.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (the State) 
concedes that the charges for Count 13, Count 15, and Count 16 
were defective because they failed to allege the requisite mens 
rea and, thus, the counts should be dismissed without prejudice. 
The State counters that the Circuit Court did not err by refusing 
to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense because the 
evidence did not support such an instruction and, regardless, it 
was a harmless error given the conviction for the greater charged 
offense. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Flores's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) An indictment must contain the elements of the 
offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprise the 
defendant of what he or she must be prepared to meet. State v. 
Wells, 78 Hawai' i 373, 379-80, 894 P.2d 70, 76-77 (1995). In 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court explained that, although the state of mind requirement was not an element of the charged offense, it was a 
necessary component of a sufficient charge. 127 Hawai' i at 56, 
276 P.3d at 625. The Hawai' i Supreme Court explained that the 
state of mind requirement was necessary "to alert the defendants 
of precisely what they needed to defend against to avoid a 
conviction." Id. In this case, Count 13 charged Flores with 
Felon in Possession in violation of HRS § 134-7(b) & (h). The 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statute does not identify a particular state of mind in either 
subsection (b) or (h). "When the state of mind required to 
establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law, 
that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person 
acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly." HRS § 702-204 
(1993). Therefore, Flores must have acted intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly with regard to the alleged violation of 
HRS § 134-7(b) & (h) that was charged in Count 13. See State v. 
Holbron, 78 Hawai' i 422, 424-25, 895 P.2d 173, 175-76 (App. 1995) 
(holding that the requisite state of mind for conviction of 
possession of firearm or ammunition by a convicted person is 
possession of such contraband intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly); see also State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 140, 913 
P.2d 57, 66 (1996) ("Absent statutory language expressly imposing absolute liability, the states of mind denominated in HRS 
§ 702–204 will generally apply, because we will not lightly 
discern a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability."). 
The indictment was silent as to the requisite mens rea, the 
indictment did not provide Flores with sufficient notice of what 
he had to meet to defeat the criminal charge and, thus, the 
Circuit Court erred by denying Flores's motion to dismiss Count 
13. See Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625; State v. 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012). The 
appropriate remedy for the indictment's failure to allege the 
required mens rea is to dismiss the charge without prejudice. 
See Gonzalez, 128 Hawai‘i at 324, 288 P.3d at 798. 
(2) Count 15 charged Flores with carrying or
 
possessing a loaded firearm on a public highway in violation of
 
HRS § 134-26, which does not identify a particular state of mind
 
and is not a strict liability offense. Therefore, the indictment
 
was required to allege that Flores acted intentionally,
 
knowingly, or recklessly with regard to the alleged violation of
 
HRS § 134-26 that was charged in Count 15. HRS § 702-204. As
 
the indictment was silent as to the requisite mens rea, the
 
indictment did not provide Flores with sufficient notice of what

he had to meet to defeat the criminal charge and, thus, the
 
Circuit Court erred by denying Flores's motion to dismiss Count
 
15. See Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625; Gonzalez, 
128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d at 798. 
(3) Count 16 charged Flores with possession of a 
prohibited detachable ammunition magazine in violation of HRS § 134-8(c) & (d), which do not identify a particular state of 
mind and are not strict liability offenses. Therefore, the 
indictment was required to allege that Flores acted 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly with regard to the 
alleged violation of HRS § 134-8(c) & (d) that was charged in 
Count 16. HRS § 702-204. As the indictment was silent as to the 
requisite mens rea, the indictment did not provide Flores with 
sufficient notice of what he had to meet to defeat the criminal 
charge and, thus, the Circuit Court erred by denying Flores's 
motion to dismiss Count 16.
2 See Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 
P.3d at 625; Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 324, 288 P.3d at 798. 
(4) The Circuit Court declined to instruct the jury on 
unlawful imprisonment in the first degree in violation of HRS § 707-721 as a lesser included offense to the kidnapping charge. 
Assuming arguendo that there was evidence supporting a jury 
instruction on unlawful imprisonment in the first degree, the 
Circuit Court's refusal to give such an instruction was harmless 
error because the jury convicted Flores of the greater charged 
offense and, thus, would not have reached the absent lesser 
offense. State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 405, 415-16, 16 P.3d 246, 
256-57 (2001); State v. Pauline, 100 Hawai' i 356, 381, 60 P.3d 
306, 331 (2002). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that (1) Flores's convictions as
 
to Count 13, Count 15, and Count 16 are vacated and the case is
 
2
 While the holding in State v. McDowell, 66 Haw. 650, 672 P.2d 554 
(1983), is inconsistent with this conclusion, in Nesmith, the Hawai' i Supreme
Court stated that the distinction between general intent and specific crimes,
upon which McDowell turned, had been abrogated. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 56­
57; 276 P.3d at 625-26.

charges without prejudice and (2) the March 30, 2012 judgment and
