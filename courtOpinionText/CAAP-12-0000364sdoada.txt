 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellee State of Hawai' i, by its Department of Hawaiian Home 
Lands (DHHL) and against Kawa' auhau. 
Kawa'auhau filed a motion to dismiss a November 8, 2011 
complaint against him alleging the district court lacked subject 
matter jurisdiction based on the theory that the Kingdom of 
Hawai'i continues to exist as an occupied nation and that only 
military courts established by the United States have jurisdiction over summary possession actions. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude 
Kawa'auhau's appeal is without merit. 
This court has repeatedly held that claims involving 
the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai' i laws are without 
merit. In State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 
652, 664 (App. 2004), we wrote: "Whatever may be said regarding 
the lawfulness of the Provisional Government in 1893, the 
Republic of Hawai' i in 1894, and the Territory of Hawai' i in 1898, 
the State of Hawai' i was, on February 9, 2002, and is now, a 
lawful government." In State v. Kaluau, we held: "The circuit 
court did not err in precluding Kaluau from introducing 'Hawaiian 
Kingdom' evidence. The sovereignty of the State and its lawful 
jurisdiction over the inhabitants of the State is a matter of law 
that is well-established." State v. Kaluau, 125 Hawai' i 251, 1, 
258 P.3d 948 (App. 2011) (quoting Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i at 55, 
101 P.3d at 664); see also State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai' i 219, 883 
P.2d 641 (App. 1994).
