DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY ("DPS")
MAINLAND BRANCH ADMINISTRATOR SHERI KIMOTO,
Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-2228-09; S.P.P. NO. 11-1-0052)
 
ORDER GRANTING JULY 25, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee Department of
 
Public Safety ("DPS") Mainland Branch Administrator Shari
 
Kimoto's (hereinafter Appellee DPS Administrator Kimoto) July 25,
 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000367 for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction, and (2) the record, it appears that we
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
lack jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Edmund M. Abordo's 
(Appellant) appeal from the Honorable Virginia L. Crandall's March 19, 2012 minute order announcing the circuit court's intent to deny Appellant's motion for summary judgment, because the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final judgment in this case, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) and Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) require for appealability under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals only from "final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" (Emphasis added). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i holds "[a]n appeal may 
be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338. 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id.
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
 
-2­ 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 
"there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4. When interpreting
 
the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme
 Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in 
favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
Appellant is not appealing from a final judgment. 
Instead, Appellant is attempting to appeal from the circuit court's March 19, 2012 minute order when, in fact, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has specifically explained that "a minute order 
is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & 
Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) 
(emphasis added). More importantly, on June 1, 2012, the circuit court filed the record on appeal for Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000367, at which time the record on appeal did not contain a final judgment for this case. Absent an appealable final judgment, Appellant's appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee DPS Administrator
 
Kimoto's July 25, 2012 motion to dismiss Appeal No. CAAP-12­
0000367 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and Appeal
 No. CAAP-12-0000367 is dismissed.
