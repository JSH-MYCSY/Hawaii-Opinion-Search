IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SKYE KAPENAOKALANI GRIEP; TAILENE NICHOLETTE GRIEP; JOHN DOE OR
JANE DOE; ALL PERSONS RESIDING WITH AND ANY PERSONS CLAIMING
BY AND THROUGH OR UNDER THEM, Defendants-Appellants.

(CIVIL NO. RC-11-1-0608)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)

Defendants-Appellants Skye Kapenaokalani Griep

(Appellant Skye) and Tailene Nicholette Griep (Appellant Tailene)

(collectively, Appellants) appeal from the post-judgment "Order

Denying Defendants' Request For Judicial Notice" and "Findings of

Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendants' Request

For Judicial Notice," both filed by the District Court of the

1
Fifth Circuit (district court)  on April 17, 2012.
 
Appellant Skye filed an opening brief with this court, 
but Appellant Tailene did not. 
On appeal, Appellant Skye 
contends that the district court erred by: (1) denying Appellant Skye's Motion to Dismiss Complaint pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(1), filed on December 27, 2011; and (2) denying Appellant Skye's request for judicial notice of

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
documents that Appellant Skye contends show that the Kingdom of 
Hawai'i exists as a sovereign state, filed on February 9, 2012. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties, having given due consideration to the

arguments made and the issues raised, and having considered the

relevant case law and authorities, we resolve the appeal as

follows:

(1) Appellants did not timely appeal from the Writ of
 
Possession or the Judgment for Possession, both issued on

January 24, 2012, and therefore this court lacks appellate

jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of Appellant

Skye's Motion to Dismiss Complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule

12(b)(1).

(2) Appellant Skye's second point of error is that the

district court should have taken judicial notice of documents

which Appellant Skye contends show that the Kingdom of Hawai
'i 
continues as a sovereign state. Appellant Skye argues that,
 
given these documents and the continued existence of the Kingdom

of Hawai
'i, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction 
in this case. As in prior cases, however, the Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court in State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai 'i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013) 
has reaffirmed that State of Hawai 'i courts properly maintain 
jurisdiction, notwithstanding such claims.

Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the court's
jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the Kingdomgovernment. In that regard, we reaffirm that "[w]hatevermay be said regarding the lawfulness" of its origins, "theState of Hawai' i ... is now, a lawful government." State v. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664
(App.2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004).
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and notof the State are not exempt from application of the State'slaws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App.1994); State v. French, 77
Hawai'i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App.1994); Nishitani v. Baker, 82
Hawai'i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.1996); State v. Lee, 90
Hawai'i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385. The supreme court in Kaulia thus

rejected the defendant's argument that the lower court should

have allowed him to call a witness to present evidence of the

2

existence of the Kingdom of Hawai 'i to support a motion to 
dismiss challenging the court's jurisdiction. Id. at 482, 487, 
291 P.3d at 380, 385. 
Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying

Defendants' Request For Judicial Notice" and "Findings of Fact,

Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendants' Request For

Judicial Notice," both filed by the District Court of the Fifth

Circuit on April 17, 2012, are affirmed.
