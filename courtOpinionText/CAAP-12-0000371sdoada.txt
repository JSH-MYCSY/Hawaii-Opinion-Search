v.
 
EMMANUEL DAGUPION, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Wahiawa Division)
(CASE NO. 1DTC-11-018379)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Emmanuel Dagupion (Dagupion)
 
appeals from the Judgment filed on March 15, 2012, in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1/ Dagupion
 
was charged with excessive speeding for exceeding the applicable
 speed limit by 30 miles per hour or more, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) and (c)(1) (2007 & Supp.
 2012). Dagupion did not object to the sufficiency of the
 excessive speeding charge in the District Court. After a bench
 trial, he was found guilty as charged.
 
I.
 
On appeal, Dagupion argues that: (1) the excessive
 
speeding charge was defective and infringed upon his right to due
 process because if failed to allege a mens rea; and (2) the

prosecution failed to lay a sufficient foundation for the
 
District Court to admit the police officer's testimony regarding
 the speed reading from his laser gun.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court's recent decision in State v. 
Apollonio, SCWC-11-0000695, slip op., 2013 WL 5574921 (Hawai' i 
Oct. 10, 2013), provides controlling authority for our decision in Dagupion's case. Based on Apollonio, we conclude that "the charge omitted the requisite state of mind, and therefore it cannot be 'reasonably construed to state an offense.'" Id. at 
12, 2013 WL 5574921, at *5 (citation and brackets omitted). Because the charge was deficient for failing to allege a mens rea, we vacate Dagupion's conviction and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the charge without prejudice. Id. at 12­
13, 2013 WL 5574921, at *5. In light of our resolution of Dagupion's claim that the charge was defective, we do not address his claim that an inadequate foundation was laid for the admission of testimony regarding the laser gun speed reading. 
II.
 
We vacate the District Court's Judgment and remand the
 
case with instructions to dismiss the excessive speeding charge
 without prejudice.
