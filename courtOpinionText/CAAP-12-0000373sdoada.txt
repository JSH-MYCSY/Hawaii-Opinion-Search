JANONE OTTO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NOS. 1P111-03607, 1P111-03608, 1P111-03609)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Janone Otto ("Otto") appeals from
 
the convictions entered against him after a bench trial on
 
January 19, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit
 ("District Court").
1 The District Court convicted Otto on one
 
count of Criminal Property Damage in the Fourth Degree ("Count
 I"), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 708-823
 
2
(Supp. 2013),  and two counts of Harassment, in violation of HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2013) ("Counts II and III").3 Otto was

 The Honorable Faye Koyanagi presided.
 
2/
 HRS § 708-823 provides, in relevant part: 
A person commits the offense of criminal property
damage in the fourth degree if by means other than fire, the
person intentionally or knowingly damages the property of
another without the other's consent.

AW. REV. STAT. § 708-823.

 HRS § 711-1106 provides, in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if,
with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person,
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentenced, in part, to five days in jail and six months of
 
probation. 
On appeal, Otto argues that there was not substantial
 
evidence to support conviction on any of the counts.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Otto's point of error as follows:
 
We apply the following rules when reviewing the
 
sufficiency of the evidence:
 
[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution
when the appellate court passes on the legal
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction;
the same standard applies whether the case was before
a judge or jury. The test on appeal is not whether
guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of the
offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support a conclusion.
 
State v. Jones, 96 Hawai 'i 161, 181-82, 29 P.3d 351, 371-72 
(2001) (citations omitted) (quoting State v. Birdsall, 88 Hawai 'i 
1, 8, 960 P.2d 729, 736 (1998)). Additionally, "[i]t is well-
settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. 
Bailey, 126 Hawai
'i 383, 406, 271 P.3d 1142, 1165 (2012) (quoting 
State v. Martinez, 101 Hawai 'i 332, 340, 68 P.3d 606, 614 
(2003)). 
Otto was involved in an altercation with two women,
 
Tina Ishikawa ("Ishikawa") and Tiana Paia ("Paia"). Ishikawa was
 driving Paia home when a beer bottle struck her car. It was
 
that person:
 
(a)	 Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another person
in an offensive manner or subjects the other person to
offensive physical contact[.]

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
undisputed at trial that Otto had thrown the bottle.4 Testimony
 
at trial described the verbal and physical confrontation that
 
ensued. 
Otto argues that there was no substantial evidence at
 
trial that could establish that he had the requisite mental state
 to be found guilty of each offense. We disagree.
 
"[A]s trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make
 
all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in
 evidence, including circumstantial evidence." State v. Batson,
 
73 Haw. 236, 249, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) (citing State v.
 Halmos, 70 Haw. 14, 16, 755 P.2d 1226, 1227 (1988)). "[P]roof by
 circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from
 circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is
 sufficient. . . . [T]he mind of an alleged offender may be read
 from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the
 circumstances." Id. at 254, 831 P.2d at 934 (original brackets
 
omitted) (quoting State v. Sadino, 64 Haw. 427, 430, 642 P.2d
 534, 536-37 (1982)). 
As to Count I, Ishikawa testified that, as they drove
 
slowly through the neighborhood, she noticed Otto "raise his hand
 up" and "saw him throw the bottle at [her] car[.]" Her
 companion, Paia, testified that she "just seen [Otto with] a beer
 bottle in his hand . . . he threw the bottle at us -- at the
 car," adding later that "[h]e raised his hand, whipped the
 bottle[.]"  After Paia angrily confronted Otto, "[h]e chased
 
[her] around the car poking [her] face telling [her] to get out
 
of his neighborhood or he was gonna kill [her]." The testimony
 was found credible by the District Court. Viewing this evidence
 in the strongest light for the prosecution, we conclude that
 there was substantial evidence to support Otto's conviction on
 Count I.
 
As to Counts II and III, Ishikawa testified that Otto
 
"approached [them], and he was . . . threatening [them]," that
 "he placed his arm on [Ishikawa's] shoulder and shoved [her],"

 Although Otto testified that it was a can that he threw into the
street, Otto's trial counsel stated in closing argument that there was a
language barrier and the physical evidence included a broken beer bottle, and
no can.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[h]e poked [Paia] in . . . her face near her eye," and "told
 
[them] that he was gonna kill [them]." Paia testified that "as
 soon as [they] stopped [Otto] was already coming . . . towards
 us[,]" that she and Otto were "just going at it, swearing,
 yelling at each other," that "he was coming at [her] and [she]
 was walking backwards, and he just kept poking [her,]" and that
 he poked her three or four times in the face. Additionally, Otto
 stipulated that police officers, when arriving on scene, found
 him "to be agitated, angry, and [that he] had been drinking
 alcohol." Viewing this evidence in the strongest light for the
 prosecution, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to
 support Otto's conviction on Counts II and III.
 
Otto also argues that the State failed to disprove his
 
justification defense that he was acting in self-defense when he
 shoved Ishikawa and poked Paia. Assuming, for the sake of
 argument, that this defense was properly submitted to the trial
 
5
court, Otto's argument nevertheless fails.  
"The prosecution disproves a justification defense
 
beyond a reasonable doubt when the trial court believes the
 prosecution's case and disbelieves the defendant's case." State
 
v.
 Jhun, 83 Hawai 'i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996) (citing 
State v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. 448, 456-57, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (1994)); commentary to H
AW. REV. STAT. § 701-115 (1993)). Because 
the trial court found "that [Ishikawa and Paia] were credible and testified consistently as to what happened" and that "[t]he defendant was not as credible[,]" we conclude that the District court believed the State's case and disbelieved Otto's. See 
Bailey, 126 Hawai
'i at 406, 271 P.3d at 1165. Therefore, to the 
extent that it was properly submitted, the State disproved Otto's justification defense. Jhun, 83 Hawai
'i at 483, 927 P.2d at 
1366. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the three Notices of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order, filed on April 28, 2014 in the District

 Otto's trial counsel alluded to the possibility of self-defense in
closing argument by stating that if Otto touched the women, it was to "clear
space because they were in his space."
