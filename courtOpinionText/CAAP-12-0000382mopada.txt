Appellee Ticor Title Insurance Company, now known as Chicago
 
Title Insurance Company (Chicago Title). 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal arises out of a real estate dispute
 
concerning three purportedly separate lots (collectively,
 
Properties). Mau purchased the Properties in February 2007. In
 
September and November 2007, Mau sold each lot to three different
 
grantees (Grantees) via warranty deeds. Chicago Title issued
 
separate title insurance policies for each of the three
 
conveyances from Mau to the Grantees.
 
On May 12, 2009, the County of Maui (County) informed
 
one of the Grantees that the lots were not legally subdivided,
 
and the County did not recognize the lots as separate lots. 
Chicago Title paid the Grantees after claims were made against
 
the policies covering each of the lots, and the Grantees assigned
 
to Chicago Title their rights, title, and interests in any and
 
all claims related to their respective lots.
 
On November 16, 2010, Chicago Title filed a complaint
 
against Mau asserting claims for (1) breach of covenants, (2)
 
rescission, (3) breach of contract, and (4) negligent
 
misrepresentation/nondisclosure. The complaint requested a
 
judgment ordering rescission of the warranty deeds and directing
 
Mau to return to Chicago Title the purchase amount of the
 
Properties. Chicago Title also requested attorney's fees, costs,
 
and interest.
 
On July 1, 2011, Chicago Title filed a motion for
 
partial summary judgment as to the first and second counts of the
 
complaint (MSJ). Mau did not dispute that the Properties were
 
not legally subdivided when he sold the lots to Grantees. 
Consequently, Mau opposed the MSJ on the issue of damages only
 
and argued, inter alia, that there was a genuine material issue
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
regarding whether Chicago Title had failed to mitigate its
 
damages.
 
The circuit court held a hearing on the MSJ on August
 
10, 2011 and entered an order granting the MSJ on December 5,
 
2011. On December 12, 2011, Chicago Title filed a motion for
 
HRCP Rule 54(b) certification of the December 5, 2011 order
 
granting the MSJ. Chicago Title also filed a motion for
 
attorney's fees, costs, and prejudgment interest under Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 607-14 (Supp. 2012) and 636-16 (1993
 
Repl.). The circuit court granted the two motions at a hearing
 
on January 18, 2012. On March 2, 2012, the court entered its
 
orders granting the motions and entered the final judgment in
 
favor of Chicago Title as to the first and second counts of
 
Chicago Title's complaint.
 
Mau filed an HRCP Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration
 
of the circuit court's order granting the MSJ and its award of
 
attorney's fees, costs, and prejudgment interest (Motion for
 
Reconsideration) on February 13, 2012. On March 9, 2012, the
 
circuit court held a hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration
 
and entered its order denying the Motion for Reconsideration on
 
March 23, 2012. Mau filed a timely notice of appeal on April 12,
 
2012.
 
On appeal, Mau contends the circuit court erred when it
 
granted the MSJ; granted the motion for attorney's fees, costs,
 
and prejudgment interest; and denied the Motion for
 
Reconsideration.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Summary Judgment 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated that an appellate 
court 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
reviews the circuit court's grant of summary judgment de 
novo. Price v. AIG Hawai� i Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 106, 110,
111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005). Summary judgment is appropriate "if
the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, andadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material factand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as amatter of law." HRCP Rule 56(c). 
Gillan v. Gov't Employees Ins. Co., 119 Hawai' i 109, 114, 194 
P.3d 1071, 1076 (2008). 
B. Motion for Reconsideration
 
The trial court's ruling on a motion for
reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion
 
standard. Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i 373, 381, 168 P.3d 17,
25 (2007). Moreover,
 
[a]s [the Hawai' i Supreme Court] has often stated,
"the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to
allow the parties to present new evidence and/orarguments that could not have been presented duringthe earlier adjudicated motion." Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old matters or to raisearguments or evidence that could and should have beenbrought during the earlier proceeding. 
Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai' i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547
(2000) (original brackets and citations omitted). 
Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 104, 
176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). 
C. Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs
 
[The appellate] court reviews the denial and granting
of attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard.
The same standard applies to [the appellate] court's review
of the amount of a trial court's award of attorney's fees.
An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.
 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai' i, 
106 Hawai' i 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 354 (2005) (internal 
quotation marks, citations, brackets in original, and ellipses 
omitted) (quoting Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys. of 
State of Hawai' i, 92 Hawai' i 432, 439, 992 P.2d 127, 134 (2000)).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. Award of Prejudgment Interest
 
Prejudgment interest, where appropriate, is awardable
under HRS [Hawaii Revised Statutes] § 636-16 in the
discretion of the court. Generally, to constitute an abuse
of discretion it must appear that the court clearly exceeded
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant.
 
Schmidt v. Bd. of Dirs. of the Ass'n of Apartment Owners of the
 
Marco Polo Apartments, 73 Haw. 526, 533, 836 P.2d 479, 483 (1992)
 
(citations omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. The Circuit Court's Grant of the MSJ
 Mau's sole argument on appeal regarding the circuit
 
court's grant of the MSJ is that Chicago Title failed to mitigate
 its damages and thus is not entitled to the monetary judgment it
 
received. Mau argues Chicago Title could have reduced its
 
damages by participating in a joint sale of the lots. Mau's
 
Properties are part of a larger parcel of land along with six
 
other purported lots that are also not legally subdivided and are
 
not recognized by the County. Mau proposed that Chicago Title
 
and the other lot owners jointly list all nine lots for sale as a
 
single parcel. Mau contended the other option, a partition by
 
sale, was inferior because it tends to result in a lower price
 
than a joint private sale.
 
Although plaintiffs generally have a duty to make
 
reasonable efforts to mitigate damages, Malani v. Clapp, 56 Haw.
 
507, 517, 542 P.2d 1265, 1271 (1975), the mitigation doctrine
 
does not, among other circumstances, require the plaintiff to
 
deal with third parties if the plaintiff is under no contractual
 
obligation to do so. Grill v. Adams, 463 N.E.2d 896 (Ill. App.
 
Ct. 1984) (purchasers of 70% interest in property not required to
 purchase remaining 30% held by third party in order to mitigate
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
damages for seller's failure to convey the 70% interest). In
 
this case, Chicago Title is under no contractual obligation to
 
cooperate with the other lot owners, who were not parties to the
 
underlying transaction or dispute. Therefore, Chicago Title's
 
refusal to participate in a joint sale does not constitute a
 
failure to mitigate damages, and the circuit court did not err
 
when it granted the MSJ in Chicago Title's favor. 
B.	 The Circuit Court's Denial of Mau's Motion for
 
Reconsideration
 
Newly discovered evidence is a basis for 
reconsideration only if the evidence meets the following 
requirements: "(1) it must be previously undiscovered even though 
due diligence was exercised; (2) it must be admissible and 
credible; (3) it must be of such a material and controlling 
nature as will probably change the outcome and not merely 
cumulative or tending only to impeach or contradict a witness." 
Orso v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 56 Haw. 241, 250, 534 P.2d 489, 
494 (1975). Because a movant must satisfy all three 
requirements, "even assuming, arguendo, the newly discovered 
evidence is material to the issue in question, a circuit court 
will deny a motion for a new trial when the movant has failed to 
demonstrate due diligence in the discovery of the evidence." 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 
259, 948 P.2d 1055, 1100 (1997) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). See also Deponte v. Ulupalakua Ranch, Ltd., 
49 Haw. 672, 673, 427 P.2d 94, 95 (1967) (cautioning against granting new trials "upon insufficient excuses for not procuring 
the evidence when the parties had their day in Court."). 
Mau based his Motion for Reconsideration on "newly
 
discovered" escrow files he had subpoenaed from Title Guaranty
 
Escrow Services, Inc. (Title Guaranty) after the entry of the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
summary judgment. The files indicated Title Guaranty had acted
 
as the escrow agent both for Mau's February 2007 purchase of the
 
Properties and for Mau's sale of the Properties to the Grantees.
 
Mau argued Title Guaranty knew the Properties were unmarketable
 
and uninsurable from the February 2007 transaction, and Title
 
Guaranty's knowledge should have been imputed to Chicago Title. 
After reviewing the record, however, we agree with the
 
circuit court's conclusion that Mau's evidence did not constitute
 
"newly discovered evidence." The evidence Mau submitted with his
 
Motion for Reconsideration consisted primarily of escrow
 
documents from Mau's purchase of the Properties. Thus, the
 
documents may have been in Mau's possession since his purchase in
 
2007, a possibility Mau acknowledges in his briefs.
 
More importantly, all of the documents could have been
 
obtained by discovery well in advance of the court's summary
 
judgment ruling, and the record indicates Mau failed to exercise
 
due diligence. Mau did not conduct any discovery before the
 
circuit court's summary judgment ruling, and nothing in the
 
record indicates Mau requested additional time for discovery. 
See Kaneohe Bay Cruises, Inc. v. Hirata, 75 Haw. 250, 269, 861
 
P.2d 1, 11 (1993) (affirming denial of motion for reconsideration
 
where movant's failure to produce evidence prior to summary
 
judgment ruling indicated lack of due diligence, especially
 
considering that movant could have requested a continuance to
 
conduct additional discovery before the court ruled). 
Mau has offered no persuasive reason for waiting until
 
after the ruling to subpoena the documents. Mau argues he had no
 
reason to review the escrow documents until he sought
 
indemnification for the judgment from his title insurance
 
company. In his answer to the complaint, however, Mau asserted
 
several defenses based on alleged misconduct, knowledge, or
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
negligence attributable to Chicago Title's agents. Thus, Mau had
 
reason to review the escrow files as part of his due diligence. 
A cursory review of Mau's 2007 Deposit Receipt Offer and
 
Acceptance contract alone would have revealed that Title Guaranty
 
was the escrow agent for both transactions. 
Moreover, Mau's argument fails to address the fact that 
the documents were readily accessible and could have been 
discovered before the hearing. It is well established that 
reconsideration is not a device for introducing new evidence that 
could and should have been presented during the earlier 
proceeding. Kamaka, 117 Hawai' i at 104, 176 P.3d at 103. 
Because Mau grounded his Motion for Reconsideration solely on evidence that could have been discovered and presented earlier by 
exercising due diligence, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion when it denied his motion. 
C. The Circuit Court's Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs
 
Mau contends the circuit court's award of attorney's
 
fees and costs to Chicago Title was premature because the circuit
 court had not made a determination on two counts of Chicago
 
Title's complaint. We disagree. 
"[W]here a party prevails on the disputed main issue in 
a case, even though not to the extent of his original contention, 
he will be deemed to be the successful party for the purpose of 
taxing costs and attorney's fees." Fought & Co., Inc. v. Steel 
Eng'g and Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai' i 37, 52-53, 951 P.2d 487, 
502-03 (1998) (quoting MFD Partners v. Murphy, 9 Haw. App. 509, 
515, 850 P.2d 713, 716 (1992)) (internal citations, brackets, and 
quotation marks omitted). The court must first identify the 
principal issues raised by the pleadings and proof and then 
determine, on balance, which party prevailed on the issues. Id. 
The principal issue raised by the pleadings and proof
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was whether Mau breached the covenants in the deeds to the
 
Grantees. The circuit court's disposition of the first and
 
second counts resulted in a final and appealable determination of
 
Mau's liability and granted Chicago Title rescission and
 
restitution. On balance, therefore, Chicago Title was the
 
prevailing party.
 
We also reject Mau's contention that the award was 
excessive. The record shows Chicago Title's attorneys 
specifically identified the hourly billing rate, qualifications, 
experience, hours spent, and work done by each attorney, law 
clerk, and paralegal who worked on the case. The award and 
amount of attorney's fees rests within the circuit court's 
discretion, and nothing in the record establishes that the court 
has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded 
rules or principles of law or practice." Chun, 106 Hawai' i at 
431, 106 P.3d at 354. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in awarding attorney's fees and costs to Chicago Title. 
D.	 The Circuit Court's Award of Prejudgment Interest
 
"Pre-judgment interest may be awarded under HRS
 
2
§ 636–16  in the court's discretion when the issuance of judgment
is 
greatly delayed for any reason." Cnty. of Haw. v. C & J Coupe 
Family Ltd. P'ship, 124 Hawai' i 281, 311, 242 P.3d 1136, 1166 
(2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude the 
circuit court abused its discretion when it awarded prejudgment 
interest because at the trial level, Chicago Title failed to 
2
 HRS § 636-16 states: 
In awarding interest in civil cases, the judge is authorized
to designate the commencement date to conform with the
circumstances of each case, provided that the earliest
commencement date in cases arising in tort, may be the date
when the injury first occurred and in cases arising by
breach of contract, it may be the date when the breach first
occurred.
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assert any lengthy delay in the issuance of the judgment. In its
 
December 12, 2011 motion for prejudgment interest and supporting
 
memorandum, Chicago Title argued only that "[u]pon rescission, a
 
grantee is entitled to damages plus interest. . . . Prejudgment
 
interest is appropriate because Defendant has had free use of the
 
$670,000.00 paid to him for the 'lots' while Plaintiff has been
 
unable to use the property promised to it by Defendant."3
 
Moreover, the transcript from the circuit court's grant of
 Chicago Title's motion at the hearing and the order it entered do
 
not indicate the court considered or made any determination
 
regarding whether the judgment was substantially delayed.
 
Contrary to Chicago Title's contention, HRS § 636-16 
does not vest the circuit court with discretion to award 
prejudgment interest "for any number of reasons." Rather, the 
purpose of the statute is "to correct injustice when a judgment 
is delayed for a long period of time," and the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court has held that a plaintiff is not entitled to prejudgment interest in the absence of any assertion by the plaintiff that 
there had been any lengthy delay in the issuance of judgment. 
C & J Coupe, 124 Hawai' i at 311-12, 242 P.3d at 1166-67. 
Therefore, we reverse the circuit court's award of prejudgment interest.
