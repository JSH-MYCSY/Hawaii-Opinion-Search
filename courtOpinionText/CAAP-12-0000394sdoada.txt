IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
LESLIE S. KAWAMOTO, formerly known as LESLIE S. MASUDA,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v. WESLEY T. MASUDA, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 09-1-282)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
I.
 
Defendant-Appellant Wesley T. Masuda (Husband) appeals
 
from the March 19, 2012 "Order Re Plaintiff's Motion to Amend
 
Decree Granting Absolute Divorce, Filed Herein on April 11, 2011, 
and Motion to Finalize Sale of Real Property, Filed November 16,
 2011" (Amendment Order) entered by the Family Court of the Third
 Circuit (Family Court).
1
 
On appeal, Husband argues that the Family Court erred
 
when it entered the Amendment Order and the subsequent May 24,
 2012 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; Order Re Plaintiff's
 Motion to Amend Decree Granting Absolute Divorce, Filed Herein on
 April 11, 2011, and Motion to Finalize Sale of Real Property,
 Filed November 16, 2011" (FOF/COL) and resultant May 29, 2012
 "Amended Decree Granting Absolute Divorce" (Amended Decree)
 because (1) the Family Court did not have jurisdiction more than
 thirty days after the entry of the Divorce Decree finally
 dividing the property of the parties; (2) the conclusions of law
 
1
 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
do not support amendment of the decree under Hawai 'i Family Court 
Rules (HFCR) Rule 60; (3) conclusions of law 4 and 5 are
 
erroneous in describing the intent of the parties;
 (4) conclusions of law 6 is erroneous in that it incorrectly
 calculates the amount owed to Husband; (5) insufficient findings
 were made to support the amendment; and (6) the Amended Decree
 was inconsistent with prior orders.
II.
 
On October 19, 2009, Leslie S. Kawamoto, formerly known
 
as Leslie S. Masuda (Wife) initiated the instant divorce case. 
The parties eventually reached agreement as to certain terms of
 the divorce and on February 18, 2011, the agreement was read into
 the record by Wife's attorney, Brian J. De Lima (Wife's Counsel). 
Pertinent to this appeal, Wife's Counsel stated:
 
Now, this is where it's gonna get a little complicated, the
real property. What's going to happen is we're gonna submit
proposed appraisers to the Court. We want the Court to
 select one of the appraisers. We couldn't come to an
 agreement regarding the appraiser. That's why we're gonna
submit, uh, two names each within ten days to the Court to
select the appraiser. The appraiser is gonna determine the
fair market value of the real property.
 
From there we're gonna -- wife has 60 days to decide
whether she wants to buy Mr. Masuda out of his share of the
equity or to list the property for sale. If she's gonna
refinance and buy him out we're gonna deduct from the
appraised price 6 percent of the appraised price. We're
 gonna deduct the balance that was owed on the equity loan at
the time of the complaint being filed, approximately 22,000,
and we're gonna deduct 50,000, uh, which represents, uh,
one-half of the value of the boat, the Camaro and the
business. And the balance then would be divided by two, and
then she would have 120 days from the time that she decides
that she wants to buy him out to refinance him for that
amount.
 
Now, um, there's gonna be a couple other
reconciliations from that amount. For example, uh, she's
paid for the college expenses for this year. One-half of
 his obligation will be deducted from whatever she owes him.
Whatever is not -- any other, uh, expenses that we have to
reconcile may also be deducted, but that won't amount
whatever that is.
 
On April 11, 2011, the Family Court entered a Decree
Granting Absolute Divorce (Divorce Decree), stating, in relevant
 
part:

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
7. PROPERTY DIVISION
 
. . . .
 b. Wife is awarded the 2003 Honda Pilot and the
 
2006 Toyota Tacoma as her sole and separate property and
responsibility. Husband shall be awarded the 2005 Ford
 F-350, and the 1968 Chevy Camaro as his sole and separate
property and responsibility. Husband is also awarded the
 boat, with no liens or encumbrances, as his sole and
separate property and responsibility.
 
c. The parties' real properties [sic] shall be
disposed of as follows:
 
1. Property shall be appraised. The parties were
unable to agree on an appraiser and, as such, Counsel for
each party shall submit two appraisers to the Court within
10 days and the Court shall then select an appraiser. The
 appraiser shall determine the fair market value of the
property. [Wife] will then have the option of either
purchasing [Husband's] equity or to sell the property.
[Wife] shall have sixty days to determine whether to
exercise her option to purchase the property. If [Wife]
decides to purchase [Husband's] equity, the sale price shall
be appraised price minus 6% deduction for commissions if
property would have been sold. From that balance, deduct
the amount of the existing mortgage. From that balance,
deduct $50,000 which represents Husband's share of
boat/camaro/business [sic]. The balance shall be divided by
two and that is the amount which [Wife] may purchase
[Husbands'] interest in the home. Wife shall have 120 days
to refinance from the date in which she exercises her option
to purchase. If Wife fails to refinance, the property shall
be listed within one year from the filing of the decree.
 
2. The costs of the appraisal shall be divided
equally.
 
3. If the property is sold, the costs of sale and
mortgage is deducted from the sale price and from Husband's
share, $50,000 shall be provided to Wife for her interest in
boat/camaro/business [sic].
 
4. Other reconciliations for expenses are as
follows: from Husband's share his one-half share for the
 oldest child's college expenses to attend the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas.
 
Apparently neither party appealed from this Divorce Decree.
 
On November 16, 2011, Wife filed "Plaintiff's Motion to
 
Amend Decree Granting Absolute Divorce, Filed April 11, 2011, and
 
Motion to Finalize Sale of Real Property" (Motion to Amend). The
 Motion to Amend alleged that certain paragraphs of the April 11,
 2011 Divorce Decree "did not properly recite the correct
 agreement of the parties." In relevant part, Wife sought
 amendment of the Divorce Decree to reflect that, in the event
 Wife opted to buy Husband's interest in the marital residence, a
 six percent real estate commission fee and the balance of the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mortgage on the property would also be deducted from the
 
appraised value.
 
On December 14, 2011, the Family Court heard Wife's
 
Motion to Amend. Wife's Counsel immediately attempted to explain
 that he had made a mistake in his Motion to Amend to the extent
 that the $50,000, representing Wife's one-half interest in the
 Boat/Camaro/Business was erroneously included as a deduction from
 the appraised value of the marital residence. The practical
 effect of this computation was to set off or credit only $25,000
 instead of $50,000 against Husband's share of the net value of
 the residence.
 
Husband's counsel argued Wife's motion was untimely
 
because (1) the Divorce Decree gave Wife sixty days to exercise
 her option and the Motion to Amend, as orally amended, was about
 six months later; and (2) the motion was made beyond the deadline
 prescribed by the rules.
 
Wife's Counsel summarized her position as follows:

 
You know, the -– I think the mistake was basically that –
look, there's no dispute there was 100,000. Fifty grand is
half and half. We're –- we -– if you look at the decree it
says if it's sold she gets 50 grand from his share. The
 mistake was we –- it –- when -– when -– if she buys him out
we didn't have the –- we didn't –- we didn't maybe
articulate clearly that the 50 grand comes out from his
share after dividing. We eliminated one step.
 
Now, maybe it was on the tape and it didn't get caught
or –- or maybe we –- we forgot to make it clear, but
obviously we're a court of equity. She shouldn't have to
 finance her own deal.
 
THE COURT:
 
The point is the 50,000 is supposed to go
to her.
 
[Wife's Counsel]: 
Right.
 
THE COURT: 
Okay. Anything further?
 
[Husband's Counsel]:  Um, just –- just to reiterate,
um, our objection with respect to timing of the motion to
clarify, modify or amend the, uh, decree. Believe –- we
 believe it's in contravention of the rule.
 
The Family Court rejected both of Husband's arguments
 
and granted the revised Motion to Amend:
 
Court will find that under Rule 60 of the Hawaii Family
Court Rules that this court has jurisdiction. The decree in
 this case was entered or filed on . . . April 11, 2011.
Court will also find that based on the intent of the parties
for the agreement in this case that the 50,000 was supposed
to be credited to the plaintiff in this case. Also the
 Court will find that the agreement was that there was
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supposed to be a less 6 percent commission to be deducted
from the appraisal price as well as a home equity of 22,000
that was supposed to be deducted as well.
 
The Court will rule as follows: The appraisal price
of 280,000, less the 6 percent of 16,800 to be 268,200
[sic], less the home equity of 22,000, which comes out to
241,200 divided by two is 120,600. The Court will subtract
 this, uh, six -– 50,000 from the 120,600, which comes out
to, uh, 70,600, less the 9,500. The plaintiff shall buy out
the defendant at $61,100.
 
[Wife's Counsel], you prepare the order. . . . And
also prepare an amended decree.
 
On March 19, 2012, the Family Court entered the Amendment Order. 
The Amendment Order provided the following computation:
 
Appraisal
Less 6% realtor commission Less home equity loan $280,000
($ 16,800)($ 22,000)
$241,200 
Divided by two; party's share  $120,600 
Less ½ Boat/Camaro/BusinessLess reconciliation for tuition Balance/Buy out Price($ 50,000)($ 9,500)
$ 61,100 
On April 17, 2012, Husband timely filed a Notice of
 
Appeal from the March 19, 2012 Amendment Order.
 
Based on Husband's notice of appeal and HFCR Rule 52,2
 
2 At all times relevant to this appeal, HFCR Rule 52 provided,
 
RULE 52. FINDINGS BY THE COURT
 
(a) Effect.  In all actions tried in the family
court, the court may find the facts and state its
conclusions of law thereon or may announce or write and file
its decision and direct the entry of the appropriate
judgment; except upon notice of appeal filed with the court,
the court shall enter its findings of fact and conclusions
of law where none have been entered, unless the written
decision of the court contains findings of fact and
conclusions of law. To aid the court, the court may order
the parties or either of them to submit proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law, where the written decision of
the court does not contain the findings of fact and
conclusions of law, within 10 days after the filing of the
notice of appeal, unless such time is extended by the court.
Requests for findings are not necessary for purposes of
review. Findings of fact if entered shall not be set aside
unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to
the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility
of the witnesses. The findings of a master, to the extent
that the court adopts them, shall be considered as the
findings of the court. If a decision is filed, it will be
sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law
appear therein.

 Although Wife filed the November 16, 2011 Motion to
 
Amend pursuant to HFCR Rule 7, the Family Court did not err in
 
construing the motion, as amended, on its substance as a motion
 under HFCR Rule 60. See Anderson v. Oceanic Props., Inc., 3 Haw.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on April 25, 2012, the Family Court ordered the parties to submit
 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by May 10, 2012. 
Wife submitted her proposal on May 10, 2012 and on May 24, 2012,
 the Family Court entered the FOF/COL.
 
On May 29, 2012, the Family Court entered the Amended
 
Decree.
 
III.

 
Husband challenges the Family Court's Amendment Order
 
and Amended Divorce Decree. Relevant to this point, he argues
 that the Family Court's conclusions of law 1 through 6 as
 contained in the May 24, 2012 FOF/COL are in error.
A.
 
The Family Court retained jurisdiction under HFCR
 
Rule 60. Husband concedes Wife's motion was timely under HFCR
 
3
Rule 60,  but disagrees that the motion should have been granted
pursuant to HFCR Rule 60.
 
2(...continued)
(b) Amendment.  Upon motion of a party made not later
than 10 days after entry of judgment the court may amend its
findings or make additional findings and may amend the
judgment accordingly. The motion may be made with a motion
for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59. When findings of fact
are made by the court, the question of sufficiency of the
evidence to support the findings may thereafter be raised
whether or not the party raising the question has made in
the family court an objection to such findings or has made a
motion to amend them or a motion for judgment.
 
(c) Submission of Draft of a Decision. At the
 
conclusion of a hearing or trial, or at such later date as
matters taken under advisement have been decided, the judge
for convenience may designate the attorney for one of the
parties to prepare and submit a draft of a decision,
containing such provisions as shall have been informally
outlined to such attorney by the judge. The attorney
requested to prepare the proposed decision shall within 10
days, unless such time is extended by the court, deliver a
draft of the decision to the division clerk. Upon review
and finalization of form by the judge, the decision shall be
entered.

 Husband argues that the Family Court lacked jurisdiction to
consider Wife's Motion to Amend under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47.
As we conclude the Family Court had jurisdiction under HFCR Rule 60, we need
not reach this issue. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
App. 350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617 (1982) ("[I]t is the substance
 
of the pleading that controls, not its nomenclature."). Wife
 argued in her motion that the Divorce Decree incorporated a
 mistake because Wife never intended to include her one-half
 interest in the boat/Camaro/business in the calculation of equity
 in the marital residence.
 
The Family Court had jurisdiction over Wife's
 
November 16, 2011 Motion to Amend. 
B.
 
The standard for reviewing the grant or denial under
 
Rule 60 is whether there has been an abuse of discretion. 
Garamendi v. Henin, 683 F.3d 1069, 1077 (9th Cir. 2012) ("The
 standard of review for [a] Rule 60(a) claim is abuse of
 discretion.") (alteration in original, citation and internal
 
4
quotation marks omitted);  Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 123Hawai
'i 266, 272, 231 P.3d 983, 989 (App. 2010), aff'd, 125 
Hawai'i 128, 254 P.3d 439 (2011) ("In general, the standard of 
review for the grant or denial of an HFCR Rule 60(b) motion is 'whether there has been an abuse of discretion.'") (citation omitted). 
The Family Court determined that the Motion to Amend
 
was brought within one year of the Divorce Decree and the court
 had jurisdiction under HFCR Rule 60. The Family Court determined
 that the $50,000--representing Wife's share of the boat, Camaro
 automobile, and automobile repair business as stated in the
 Divorce Decree--was supposed to be credited to her. The Family
 Court concluded the treatment of this $50,000 in the Divorce
 Decree was a mistake.
 
Husband argues that there was no mistake, the parties
 
agreed to the terms as reflected in the oral statement of their
 agreement presented to the Family Court, and the Divorce Decree
 was an accurate statement of that agreement. Yet, Husband offers
 no reason for the disparate treatment of the $50,000.

 "Where, as with HFCR Rule 60(b), an HFCR is patterned after an
equivalent rule within the [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], interpretations
of the rule by the federal courts are deemed to be persuasive by Hawai' i 
appellate courts." Child Support Enf't Agency v. Doe, 98 Hawai' i 499, 503
n.7, 51 P.3d 366, 370 n.7 (2002) (citing Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. 286,290 n.6, 666 P.2d 171, 174 n.6 (1983). 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In our view, the record reveals no abuse of discretion
 
by the Family Court in amending the Divorce Decree. There is no
 
dispute that the parties agreed the boat, Camaro automobile, and
 Husband's business were worth a total of $100,000. Rather than
 selling these assets and splitting the proceeds, it was agreed
 that Husband would retain possession of these assets and Wife
 would receive her one-half share of the value, $50,000. There is
 also no dispute that, in the event of a sale of the marital
 residence, this $50,000 would be deducted from Husband's share of
 the net sale proceeds. It is also undisputed that, in the event
 of a buy-out, the Divorce Decree provided a computation that
 deducted the $50,000 from the appraisal value of the marital
 residence, and not from Husband's share of the net appraised
 value, i.e., after the realtor commission and mortgage had been
 deducted and the remaining value divided in half. As the $50,000
 represented an amount Husband owed to Wife, it was a mistake to
 give Husband a credit against the entire value of the marital
 residence rather than his share of that value; it effectively
 gave Husband a credit against moneys that were not solely his,
 but shared with Wife, thereby reducing his payment to Wife. 
HFCR Rule 60(a) allows for the correction of clerical
 
mistakes at any time, whether by motion or sua sponte. Husband
 argues that HFCR Rule 60 does not apply because the Family
 Court's amendment substantively changed the Divorce decree. 
However,
 
The relevant inquiry under Rule 60(a) is not whether making
the correction will have any effect on the parties' rights
and obligations under the judgment. Most of the time, it
will.[] Rather, the question is whether granting the motion
would require the district court either to adjudicate an
issue it has not previously reached or to make a substantive
modification to a prior adjudication. Where the record
 
makes it clear that an issue was actually litigated and
decided but was incorrectly recorded in or inadvertently
omitted from the judgment, the district court can correct
the judgment under Rule 60(a), even where doing so
materially changes the parties' positions and leaves one
party to the judgment in a less advantageous position.
 
Rivera v. PNS Stores, Inc., 647 F.3d 188, 199 (5th Cir. 2011)
 
(emphasis added). Here, it is clear that the parties decided to
 equally split the value of the boat, car, and business prior to
 the entry of the Divorce Decree. It is equally clear that the
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
computation of the final buy-out figure in the Divorce Decree did
 
not accomplish this.
 
On the record before us, we are not convinced the
 
Family Court abused its discretion in granting Wife's Motion to
 Amend.
 
C.
 
Finally, Husband argues that the Family Court erred in 
its Amended Decree as it contains ambiguities and could be interpreted as requiring Husband to repay Wife for their son's college expenses twice. Husband's arguments amount to speculation, based on future events, and therefore any decision regarding these arguments would be premature. See Kapuwai v. 
City & County of Honolulu, 121 Hawai
'i 33, 40, 211 P.3d 750, 757 
(2009) ("[I]n 'the absence of ripeness,' appellate courts are 'without jurisdiction to consider [the] appeal.'") (second alteration in original, citation omitted).
