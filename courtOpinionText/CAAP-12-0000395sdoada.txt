 STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BLADESIN-ISAIAH K. BAILEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-1061)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bladesin-Isaiah K. Bailey
 
("Bailey") appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence,
 
filed on March 19, 2012, in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1 After a jury trial, the Circuit
 
Court entered judgment against Bailey for one count of Robbery in
 the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 ("HRS") § 708-841.
2 Bailey was sentenced as a "youthful
 
offender" to five years imprisonment to run consecutively with
 his sentence in another case, with credit for time served.

 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.

 Bailey was indicted and convicted under subsections (1)(a) and/or
(1)(b). HRS § 708-841(1) provides: 
A person commits the offense of robbery in the second
degree if, in the course of committing theft . . . : 
(a)	 The person uses force against the person of
anyone present with the intent to overcome that
person's physical resistance or physical power
of resistance; [or]
 
(b)	 The person threatens the imminent use of force
against the person of anyone who is present with
intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of
or escaping with the property[.]

On appeal, Bailey argues that (1) the Circuit Court
 
erred by denying Bailey's motion for judgment of acquittal, and
 
(2) there was not substantial evidence to support his conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Bailey's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Bailey waived his right to argue that denial of his 
motion for judgment of acquittal was in error. A defendant waives such right by presenting evidence after the close of the State's case. State v. Pudiquet, 82 Hawai' i 419, 423, 922 P.2d 
1032, 1036 (1996). Bailey presented evidence in his defense. He has waived his right to now argue error. 
(2) Bailey's challenge to the sufficiency of the
 
evidence is without merit. For Bailey to prevail here, there
 must have been no substantial evidence that, in the course of
 committing theft, he, or an accomplice for whose acts he is
 
3
liable,  either: 
use[d] force against the person of anyone present with the
intent to overcome that person's physical resistance or
physical power of resistance [or] threaten[ed] the imminent
use of force against the person of anyone who is present
with intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of or
escaping with the property. 
HAW. REV. STAT. §§ 702-222, 708-841. Considering the evidence in 
the light most favorable to the State, see State v. Richie, 88 
Hawai'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998), we conclude that 
there was substantial evidence to support Bailey's conviction. 
The jury heard testimony from the complainant, Bailey,
 
and other witnesses present at the scene. The complainant and
 other witnesses testified that Bailey confronted the complainant,
 challenged him to fight, punched him, grabbed him, and placed him
 in a choke hold. There was also testimony that, while Bailey had 
the complainant in a choke hold and held him down, Bailey yelled
 to his companions to search the complainant's pockets, whereupon
 one of the companions removed and kept the complainant's cell

phone; at that point, Bailey released the complainant.4 On these 
facts, a person of reasonable caution could conclude that Bailey 
acted with the intent of dispossessing complainant of his belongings and did so forcibly. See State v. Grace, 107 Hawai' i 
133, 139, 111 P.3d 28, 34 (App. 2005).

Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the March 19, 2012 Judgment
 
of Conviction and Sentence, filed in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit, is affirmed.

 It is undisputed that there was a physical altercation between
Bailey and the complainant and that one of Bailey's companions took complainant's
cell phone. To the extent that Defendant's testimony characterized the incidentdifferently, it is for the jury, not this court, to reconcile conflictingtestimony. See State v. Martinez, 101 Hawai' i 332, 340, 68 P.3d 606, 614 (2003).

 Bailey suggests that his actions were more consistent with an intent
to search the complainant for weapons for Bailey's own safety. Nevertheless, weconclude that it would have been at least justifiable for the jury to infer,instead, that Bailey intended to dispossess the complainant of any belongingfound on his person. See Grace, 107 Hawai' i at 139, 111 P.3d at 34 ("Under [a
review for sufficiency of the evidence], we give full play to the right of thefact finder to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiableinferences of fact." (quoting State v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai' i 409, 422, 23 P.3d 744,
757 (App. 2001))).
