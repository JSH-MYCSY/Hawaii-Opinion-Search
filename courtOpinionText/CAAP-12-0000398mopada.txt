DENNIS T. IHARA, Claimant-Appellee, Cross-Appellant,
v. STATE OF HAWAII, DEPARTMENT OF LAND & NATURAL
RESOURCES, Employer-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2008-266 (2-07-40277))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard, J.; and
Circuit Judge Kuriyama, in place of Nakamura, C.J., and 
Fujise, Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ., all recused)
 
Employer-Appellant, Cross-Appellee, State of Hawai 'i, 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) appeals from the 
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (LIRAB's) Decision 
and Order filed March 13, 2012 (March 13, 2012 Decision). The 
DLNR challenges the LIRAB's award of $250.00 in permanent partial 
disability (PPD) benefits and its determination that the DLNR is 
liable for vocational rehabilitation (VR) services. Claimant-
Appellee, Cross-Appellant Dennis T. Ihara (Ihara) cross-appeals 
from the March 13, 2012 Decision as well, claiming that the LIRAB 
erred in failing to assess a 20% penalty against the DLNR for failure to timely pay temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. 
Ihara also appeals the LIRAB's Attorney's Fee Approval and Order 
filed April 23, 2012. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
I. BACKGROUND FACTS
 
On April 3, 2007, the DLNR filed a WC-1: Employer's
 
Report of Industrial Injury based on Ihara's claim that he
 
suffered from increased hypertension and stress due to the
 pressures of his job as Deputy Registrar at the Bureau of
 Conveyances. Ihara asserted that his injury occurred on
 approximately February 1, 2007. In support of Ihara's claim,
 Ihara's physician, Dr. Ronald A. Morton (Dr. Morton), submitted a
 
letter stating that Ihara had been in reasonably good health with
 
controlled hypertension but that work stress had recently caused
 a marked elevation in his blood pressure. The DLNR, through its
 workers' compensation insurance carrier, denied liability pending
 investigation of Ihara's claim. 
An Independent Medical Examination (IME) was performed
 
by Dr. Ajit Arora (Dr. Arora) on May 15, 2007. Dr. Arora's
 
report dated May 21, 2007 diagnosed Ihara with "Essential
 
hypertension, genetically based, with temporary aggravation." 
An Independent Psychiatric Examination (IPE) was
 
performed by Dr. Jon Streltzer (Dr. Streltzer) on June 6, 2007. 
In a report dated June 19, 2007, Dr. Streltzer diagnosed Ihara
 
with, among other things, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety,
 Primary Insomnia, Occupational Problem (not a mental disorder),
 and High Blood Pressure. 
Based on Dr. Arora's and Dr. Streltzer's IME and IPE,
 
the DLNR accepted compensability for Ihara's claim as a temporary
 aggravation. Ihara was instructed to have his medical providers
 submit reports and statements of their services to the Department
 of Human Resources Development, State Workers' Compensation
 Division. Ihara submitted various notes from Dr. Morton and
 psychiatrist Dr. Dennis Lind (Dr. Lind) excusing him from work
 
and stating that he was disabled for certain dates. However, the
 
claims manager of the Department of Human Resources Development,
 Employee Claims Division (ECD), then wrote to Drs. Morton and
 
Lind requesting clarification as to the reasons for Ihara's
 
disability on certain dates in light of the reports by Drs.
 Streltzer and Arora that Ihara was able to perform his job
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
duties. The ECD also wrote to Dr. Arora for an opinion as to
 
whether treatment by Dr. Morton was still necessary and if the
 drug Atenolol prescribed by Dr. Morton was necessary to control
 Ihara's blood pressure. Additionally, Dr. Streltzer was also
 contacted and asked whether he agreed with Dr. Lind's assessment
 that Ihara was unable to return to work and whether anything
 might explain the deterioration in Ihara's condition that Dr.
 Lind mentioned.
 
Dr. Streltzer submitted a supplemental report dated
 
September 27, 2007. Dr. Streltzer noted that a review of Ihara's
 records indicated that he had been put on leave without pay with
 his last day at work being June 12, 2007. Dr. Streltzer wrote
 that, in terms of treatment: 
Ideally, communication with the Employer should be made in
order to determine if there are circumstances in which Mr.
 Ihara will be accepted back at his job and allowed to do his
work. If this is accomplished and the employer would like
to have him back, it is likely that he will be able to
return to full-time duty with perhaps the only restriction
being the need for flexible hours due to his sleep
disturbance. If it is not possible to come to an agreement
with the Employer, then alternative employment will have to
be sought. When such alternative employment is obtained, it
is likely that Mr. Ihara's anxiety symptoms will
substantially improve.
 
Dr. Arora submitted a supplemental report dated October
 
19, 2007 opining that Ihara's hypertension was no longer an issue
 
and should not have been considered a labor disabling condition. 
He deferred to Drs. Streltzer and Lind as to Ihara's psychiatric
 condition. 
In addition to claiming eligibility for TTD benefits,
 
Ihara also claimed eligibility for VR services. On October 16,
 
2007, the ECD formally objected to Ihara's eligibility for VR
 
services and on November 5, 2007, the ECD requested a hearing
 before the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR),
 
Disability Compensation Division on the issue. 
Dr. Arora submitted another supplemental report to ECD
 
dated November 29, 2007. In this report, Dr. Arora wrote:
 
1. Mr. Ihara had a temporary exacerbation of his pre­
existing non-industrial hypertension due to emotional
distress associated with occupational environment.
 
2. The temporary exacerbation ended on 08/30/07.
 
3
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
3. No further treatment for hypertension is indicated on
industrial basis as of 08/30/07.
 
Based on Dr. Arora's reports, the ECD notified Dr.
 
Morton and Ihara that its position was that Ihara's temporary
 
exacerbation of his hypertension ended on August 30, 2007 and
 that "no further treatment for his hypertension is indicated on
 an industrial basis." 
In addition to the issues requested by the ECD to be
 
heard by the DLIR, Ihara requested that the DLIR also hear the
 issues of "(1) compensability; (2) TTD benefits; and, (3) medical
 expenses[.]" A hearing was held in front of a hearings officer
 
of the DLIR on March 18, 2008. In the DLIR's Decision filed May
 
7, 2008 (May 7, 2008 Decision) stated:
 
1. Pursuant to Sections 386-21 and 386-26, HRS, said
employer shall pay for such medical care, services and
supplies as the nature of the injury may require.
 
2. Pursuant to Section 386-31(b), HRS, said employer shall
pay to claimant weekly compensation of $630.72 for temporary
total disability beginning (waiting period: 6/12/2007
through 6/14/2007; 6/15/2007 through 6/17/2007; 8/2/2007
only; 8/10/2007 through 10/16/2007; 10/28/2007 through
11/30/2007; 3/13/2008 through 4/15/2008 for 20.0000 weeks,
for a total of $12,614.40. Additional temporary total
disability, if any, shall be paid upon receipt of medical
certification.
 
3. Pursuant to Section 386-25, HRS, claimant remains
eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation services.
 
4. The matter of the employer's responsibility for the
prescriptive drug, Atenolol, is held in abeyance until
clarification is received from Ronald Morton, M.D.
 
5. The matters of permanent disability and/or disfigurement,
if any, shall be determined at a later date.
 
The DLNR appealed the Decision to the LIRAB on May 23,
 
2008. The DLNR also filed a Motion for Stay of Payments, which
 
was rejected. 
On June 19, 2008, the ECD wrote to Drs. Lind and Morton
 
for their opinions as to whether Ihara could return to work. Dr.
 
Lind responded on June 25, 2008 that Ihara had reached medical
 stability and could work in other situations, but not the DLNR,
 due to the work environment. Dr. Morton responded on June 27,
 2008 that Ihara could return to regular duty work and had reached
 medical stability.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On July 11, 2008, the DLNR discharged Ihara from his
 
position with the Bureau of Conveyances via letter. The DLNR's
 
termination letter stated: "Based on Dr. Lind's current medical
 assessment that you 'can work other situations - just not DLNR',
 we find that you are medically disqualified for continued civil
 service employment in Position Number 00137, Deputy Registrar of
 the Bureau of Conveyances and any DLNR employment." Ihara had
 not yet finished his probationary period at the time of the
 discharge.
 
Throughout the pendency of this case, Dr. Lind
 
submitted multiple treatment plans to the ECD. The latest
 treatment plan was dated December 13, 2008. However, a
 psychiatric IME had been conducted, at the request of the DLNR,
 by Dr. Danilo E. Ponce (Dr. Ponce) on October 11, 2008. Dr.
 
Ponce concluded that Ihara "reached full clinical remission, with
 
no discernible residual, permanent psychiatric impairment[,]" and
 that treatment with Dr. Lind was no longer necessary. Based on
 Dr. Ponce's opinion, the DLNR rejected Dr. Lind's December 13,
 2008 treatment plan. 
On June 9, 2009, Ihara and the DLNR submitted a
 
stipulation for temporary remand agreeing to have the case
 remanded to the DLIR Disability Compensation Division to address
 the following issues:
 
(1) Claimant's entitlement to and the period of temporary
total disability benefits; (2) Claimant's entitlement to the
medication, Atenolol; (3) the continuation or closure of
vocational rehabilitation services with Alan S. Ogawa; (4)
the nature and extent of permanent partial disability, if
any; and (5) the extent of disfigurement, if any.
 
A hearing was held on September 22, 2009. A
 
supplemental decision was issued on October 28, 2009, stating:
 
1. Pursuant to Sections 386-21 and 386-26, HRS, said
employer shall pay for such medical care, services, and
supplies as the nature of the injury may require.
 
2. Pursuant to Section 386-31(b), HRS, said employer shall
pay to claimant weekly compensation of $630.72 for temporary
total disability beginning 4/16/2008 through 5/15/2008; and
8/31/2008 through 8/17/2009.
 
3. Pursuant to Section 386-32(b), HRS, said employer shall
pay to claimant weekly compensation for temporary partial
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disability from work beginning 5/16/2008 through 6/24/2008;
and 7/1/2008 through 8/30/2008.
 
4. Pursuant to Section 386-92, HRS, the employer shall pay
an additional 20% to the above noted payments for temporary
total and temporary partial disability.
 
5. Vocational Rehabilitation services shall cease effective
 
8/17/2009.
 
6. The treatment plan of Dennis Lind, M.D., dated 12/13/2008
is hereby denied.
 
7. No permanent disability or disfigurement resulted from
this accident.
 
8. This case is hereby transmitted back to the Labor and
Industrial Relations Appeals Board for a hearing and
determination of all issues on appeal.
 
Both Ihara and the DLNR appealed from the DLIR's
 
October 28, 2009 supplemental decision. The LIRAB granted a
 
Motion for Stay of Payments. 
A trial was scheduled before the LIRAB for April 8,
2011. On March 13, 2012, the LIRAB issued its Decision and Order
 affirming in part, reversing in part, and modifying in part the
 DLIR's May 7, 2008 Decision and October 28, 2009 supplemental
 decision. The LIRAB made several Findings of Fact (FOF) and
 
Conclusions of Law (COL) including, inter alia:
 

 
[FOF 20:]  The Board credits Dr. Ponce's opinion
regarding further treatment and finds that the treatment
requested in Dr. Lind's December 13, 2008 was not reasonable
and necessary for, or required by the nature of, Claimant's
February 1, 2007 work injury.
 
. . . .

 
[FOF 35:]  The Board finds that Claimant was medically

stable as of June 27, 2008.
 
[FOF 36:]  . . . The Board finds that Employer's
statement that Claimant was "medically disqualified" for his
position was an admission or acknowledgment that Claimant
was permanently disabled. The Board finds this to be
 especially so, because Employer sought out and received
opinions of medical stability from Drs. Morton and Lind
before it sent this letter.
 
[FOF 37:] The Board credits the opinions that Claimant
sustained no ratable impairment. However, Employer's July
11, 2008 letter admitted or acknowledged permanent
disability, stated that Claimant was "medically
disqualified" for his position, and terminated him
therefrom. Therefore, the Board finds that Claimant
sustained permanent partial disability in the amount of
$250.00.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . . 
[COL 1:]  Pursuant to Section 386-31, HRS, the Board
concludes that Claimant's period of temporary total
disability, resulting from the February 1, 2007 work injury,
was as follows:
 
Waiting period:  June 12, 13, 14, 2007
June 15,[2]007 - June 18, 2007
August 2, 2007
August 10, 2007 through October 8, 2007 

[ 1]
The Board further concludes that Claimant was entitled
 
to, and Employer liable for, VR-TTD benefits, pursuant to
Section 386-25(d), HRS, for the period October 8, 2007
through August 17, 2009, with appropriate adjustments and
reductions for wages Claimant earned during that period.
The Board makes no determination as to whether
 
Claimant is entitled to further TTD benefits or VR-TTD
 benefits after August 17, 2009. Said issues are to be
 determined by the Director, in accordance with the findings
and conclusions herein.
 
[COL 2:]
 The Board concludes that Claimant was not
entitled to, and Employer was not liable for, temporary
partial disability ("TPD") benefits as a result of the
February 1, 2007 work injury.
. . . . 
[COL 3:]  The Board concludes that Claimant is not
entitled to, and Employer is not liable for, a 20% penalty
on TTD. Furthermore, because the Board has concluded that
Claimant was not entitled to, and Employer was not liable
for, TPD, a fortiori Employer is not liable for a 20%
penalty on TPD.
 
[COL 4:]  Employer requested opinions of medical
stability from Drs. Morton and Lind. By July [sic] 27,
2008, both physicians informed Employer of their opinions
that Claimant was medically stable and, therefore, no longer
in a state of "temporary" disability. Rather, Claimant was
at the "permanent" stage of recovery.
By its July 11, 2008 letter, Employer admitted or
acknowledged that Claimant was "medically disqualified,"
which, as noted above, the Board interpreted to be an
admission or acknowledgment of permanent disability.
There is no requirement in the statute that permanent
partial disability be expressed either in weeks or in
 
1 Although the LIRAB concluded that Ihara was entitled to TTD for
these periods, in its FOF 21 and 22, it held that, because Ihara earned income
after the work injury as an adjunct professor for Hawaii Pacific University,
he was not entitled to TTD benefits for the periods of:
 
December 16, 2007 - December 31, 2007
January 1, 2008 - January 15, 2008
January 16, 2008 - January 31, 2008
February 1, 2008 - February 15, 2008
May 16, 2008 - May 27, 2008
May 28, 2008 - June 15, 2008
June 16, 2008 - June 30, 2008
July 1, 2008 - July 15, 2008
July 16, 2008 - July 31, 2008
August 1, 2008 - August 15, 2008
August 16, 2008 - August 31, 2008.
 
7

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
percentages. Therefore, given the unique circumstances of
this case, particularly Employer's admission or
acknowledgment of medical disqualification or permanent
disability, the Board concludes that Claimant is entitled
to, and Employer is liable for, benefits for permanent
partial disability in the amount of $250.00, as a result of
the February 1, 2007 work injury.
 
[COL 5:]
 Given the foregoing determination that
Claimant is entitled to, and Employer is liable for,
benefits for permanent partial disability, the Board further
concludes that Claimant is entitled to, and Employer is
liable for, vocational rehabilitation services as a result
of the work injury of February 1, 2007.
 
[COL 6:]  Claimant's VR services were terminated based
upon a determination by the VRU that Claimant would not have
impairment due to the work injury.
Employer's documented admission or acknowledgment of
permanent disability and its termination of Claimant because
of his "medical disqualification" leads the Board to
conclude that Claimant is entitled to VR services after
 October 20, 2008 and through at least August 17, 2009.
The Board leaves to the Director the determination of
 
Claimant's entitlement to VR after August 17, 2009.
 
[COL 7:] 
The Board concludes that Claimant is not
entitled to, and Employer is not liable for, medical care,
services and supplies pursuant to Dr. Dennis Lind's December
13, 2008 treatment plan because such treatment is not
reasonable and necessary for, and not required by the nature
of, Claimant's February 1, 2007 work injury.
 
The DLNR timely filed a Notice of Appeal on April 11,
 
2012. Ihara timely filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal on April 25,
 
2012. 
On April 23, 2012, the LIRAB filed an Attorney's Fee
 
Approval and Order finding that the DLNR was the prevailing party
 "on the crucial issue of permanent partial disability" on appeal
 and ordering Ihara responsible for $13,905.74 in attorney's fees,
 applicable taxes, and costs. Ihara timely appealed the award of
 attorney's fees.
 II. POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL

 
The DLNR challenges the following FOFs and COLs in the
LIRAB's March 13, 2012 Decision: 

 
(1) FOF 36: "Employer's statement that Claimant was
 
'medically disqualified' for his position was an admission or
 acknowledgment that Claimant was permanently disabled." 
(2) FOF 37: "Employer's July 11, 2008 letter admitted
 
or acknowledged permanent disability, stated that Claimant was
 'medically disqualified' for his position, and terminated him
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
therefrom. Therefore, the Board finds that Claimant sustained
 
permanent partial disability in the amount of $250.00." 
(3) COL 4: "There is no requirement in the statute
 
that permanent partial disability be expressed either in weeks or

 
in percentages. Therefore, given the unique circumstances of
 this case, particularly Employer's admission or acknowledgment of
 medical disqualification or permanent disability, the Board
 concludes that Claimant is entitled to, and Employer is liable
 for, benefits for permanent partial disability in the amount of
 $250.00, as a result of the February 1, 2007 work injury." 
(4) COL 5: "Given the foregoing determination that
 
Claimant is entitled to, and Employer is liable for, benefits for

 
permanent partial disability, the Board further concludes that
 Claimant is entitled to, and Employer is liable for, vocational
 rehabilitation services as a result of the work injury on
 February 1, 2007." 
(5) COL 6: "Employer's documented admission or
acknowledgment of permanent disability and its termination of

 
Claimant because of his 'medical disqualification' leads the
 Board to conclude that Claimant is entitled to VR services after
 October 20, 2008 and through at least August 17, 2009." 

 
On cross-appeal, Ihara challenges FOF 32 and COL 3 in

 
the LIRAB's March 13, 2012 Decision, which state:
 
(1) FOF 32: "The Board finds no credible evidence to
support an assessment against Employer of a 20% penalty for
 untimely TTD benefit payments."
 

 
(2) COL 3: "The Board concludes that Claimant is not
 
entitled to, and Employer is not liable for, a 20% penalty on
 TTD. Furthermore, because the Board has concluded that Claimant
 was not entitled to, and Employer was not liable for, TPD, a
 fortiori Employer is not liable for a 20% penalty on TPD."
 
Ihara also challenges the LIRAB's Attorney's Fee
 
Approval and Order filed April 23, 2012, arguing that:
 
(3) The LIRAB erred in finding that DLNR was the
 
prevailing party for purposes of an attorney's fee award. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) The LIRAB erred in ordering that "the total amount
 
of $13,905.74 for attorney's fees, applicable taxes, and costs

 
are approved. The approved sum is made a lien upon compensation
 
payable by Employer. Claimant is otherwise responsible for
 payment of the approved amount."
 III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW

 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS §
91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
We have previously stated: 
FOFs are reviewable under the clearly erroneous
standard to determine if the agency decision was
clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence on the whole record. 
COLs are freely reviewable to determine if the
agency's decision was in violation of constitutional
or statutory provisions, in excess of statutory
authority or jurisdiction of agency, or affected by
other error of law.
 
A COL that presents mixed questions of fact and
law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard
because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. When mixed
 questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate
court must give deference to the agency's expertise
and experience in the particular field. The court
 should not substitute its own judgment for that of the
agency.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial
evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2)
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We have
 defined "substantial evidence" as credible evidence which is
 of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

[An appellate court] generally reviews questions of
statutory interpretation de novo, but, in the case of
ambiguous statutory language, the applicable standard of
review regarding an agency's interpretation of its own
governing statute requires [courts] to defer to the agency's
expertise and to follow the agency's construction of the
statute unless that construction is palpably erroneous[.]

IV. DISCUSSION
 A. The PPD Benefits
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-32(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2014) includes a list of specific disabilities and provides a
 schedule of benefits for these disabilities, calculated as the
 effective maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in HRS § 386-31
 
2
(1993 & Supp. 2014)  multiplied by the number of weeks specified
for the disability. However, for disabilities which are not
 listed, HRS § 386-32(a) states that benefits shall be calculated
 as follows:
 
Other cases. In all other cases of permanent partial
disability resulting from the loss or loss of use of a part
of the body or from the impairment of any physical function,
weekly benefits shall be paid at the rate and subject to the
limitations specified in this subsection for a period that
bears the same relation to a period named in the schedule as
the disability sustained bears to a comparable disability
named in the schedule. In cases in which the permanent
partial disability must be rated as a percentage of the
 
2
 Under HRS § 386-31, the maximum weekly benefit rate is calculated
as follows:

 
Beginning January 1, 1975, and during each succeedingtwelve-month period thereafter, not more than the state
average weekly wage last determined by the director, rounded
to the nearest dollar, nor less than $38 or twenty-five per
cent of the foregoing maximum amount, rounded to the nearest
dollar, whichever is higher.
 
11

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
total loss or impairment of a physical or mental function of
the whole person, the maximum compensation shall be computed
on the basis of the corresponding percentage of the product
of three hundred twelve times the effective maximum weekly
benefit rate prescribed in section 386-31.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
Ihara's alleged disabilities, i.e., hypertension and
 
various mental health issues, are not comparable to any scheduled
 
disability. Thus, the underlined section of the statute applies. 
In its FOFs, the LIRAB explicitly stated that Ihara was medically
 stable as of June 27, 2007 and it credited the opinions that
 Ihara sustained no ratable impairment. It is unclear whether the
 
LIRAB meant that Ihara suffered no impairment or whether it
 
determined that he had suffered some impairment, but in an amount
 incapable of being measured.
3 However, following either
 
interpretation, the LIRAB's subsequent determination that Ihara
 was entitled to $250 in PPD benefits appears to be in error.
 
If the LIRAB's conclusion was that Ihara suffered no
 
impairment, then its interpretation of HRS § 386-32(a) was
 erroneous because a PPD award requires a finding that there is
 some mental or physical impairment. HRS § 386-1 (1993 & Supp.
 2014), which sets forth the definitions used in Chapter 386, the
 Workers' Compensation Law, defines a disability as "loss or
 impairment of a physical or mental function." The definition of
 disability has not changed since it was first introduced in 1963. 
At that time, the legislature wrote: "A definition of disability
 has been added so as to make clear that disability means bodily
 impairment and not impairment of earning power. The basis of
 compensability in Hawaii is loss of physical or mental
 functioning, regardless of whether or not it entails loss of
 earnings." S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 334, in 1963 Senate Journal,
 at 789. Thus, if the LIRAB determined that Ihara had no physical

 In support of the interpretation that the LIRAB found that Ihara
suffered no impairment is its FOF 13 which states that "Dr. Ponce opined that
Claimant had no permanent psychiatric impairment." In support of the
interpretation that the LIRAB found Ihara suffered from some impairment, but
not in a ratable amount, is FOF 16 which states that "Dr. Lind opined that
Claimant had reached maximum medical improvement and had permanent impairment
that was more than zero."

or mental impairment, it could not have determined that he was
 
entitled to PPD benefits. 
Further, in awarding PPD benefits, the LIRAB was not
 
entitled to simply rely on the DLNR's statement that Ihara was
 "medically disqualified" from continuing employment at the Bureau
 of Conveyances as a substitute for a finding of some impairment. 
The legislative intent of HRS § 386-32(a) makes clear that PPD is
 solely based on a claimant's physical or mental impairment and
 not on his ability to work. 
In Cuarisma v. Urban Painters, Ltd., 59 Haw. 409, 583 
P.2d 321 (1978), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court rejected the argument 
that benefits for disfigurement, which is classified as a type of PPD under HRS § 386-32(a), are intended to compensate for presumed loss of wage-earning capacity. Instead, it found that the legislature had intended to relate disfigurement benefits to the amount of impairment of bodily integrity. Id. at 421, 583 
P.2d at 321. Cuarisma limited its holding to disfigurement 
awards and not other forms of PPD.
4 Id. at 413, 583 P.2d at 323­
24. However, it noted that, in revising HRS § 386-32 in 1969,
 
the House Committee on Labor and Employment had stated that:
 "Permanent partial disability compensation is an indemnity
 payment for the loss or impairment of a physical function and,
 unlike temporary total disability benefits, is not compensation
 to replace current loss of wages." Id. at 420, 583 P.2d at 327
 
(quoting H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 193, in 1969 House Journal, at
 702). 
Though Cuarisma only documents the history of HRS
 
§ 386-32 up to 1969, the subsequent history of the statute
 strengthens the conclusion that awards for PPD are meant to be

 Note however, that the supreme court in Tabieros v. Clark 
Equipment Co., 85 Hawai' i 336, 389, 944 P.2d 1279, 1332 (1997) characterized
Cuarisma as standing for the proposition that "within the context of a
permanent partial 'disability,' the degree of 'impairment' is important indetermining workers' compensation for an injury even if it is unrelated tofuture working capacity." Also note that a concurring opinion in Capua v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 117 Hawai' i 439, 452, 184 P.3d 191, 204 (2008) (Acoba, J.,
joined by Nakayama, J., concurring) would narrowly construe Cuarisma and holdthat "there is no authority for the propositions . . . that PPD benefits are'not compensation to replace loss of wages' . . . ." 
13

based on the extent of a claimant's impairment and not on his
 
wage-earning capacity or ability to work. In 1970, the language
 in the paragraph in HRS § 386-32(a) referring to "other cases" of
 PPD was revised to read: "In cases in which the permanent
 partial disability must be rated as a percentage of total loss or
 impairment of physical or mental function of the whole man the
 maximum compensation shall be computed on the basis of the
 corresponding percentage of $35,100." 1970 Haw. Sess. Laws, Reg.
 Sess., Act 100, § 1 at 180 (emphasis added). Previously, the
 statute had read "In cases in which the permanent partial
 disability must be rated as a percentage of total disability the
 maximum compensation shall be computed on the basis of the
 corresponding percentage of $35,100." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 418-70, in 1970 House Journal, at 976. In explaining its
 reasoning for the change, the legislature wrote:
 
There has been some confusion in the application of
the provision above because of other language in the law.
While "disability" is defined as "loss or impairment of a
physical or mental function," "total disability" is defined
as "disability of such an extent that the disabled employee
has no reasonable prospect of finding regular employment of
any kind in the normal labor market." . . . Permanent
partial disability compensation payments under the law,
however, are based primarily on impairment of physical or
mental function and not on ability for work. To avoid a
 
possible confusion, the proposed amendment, which would make
it clear that the amount of permanent partial disability
compensation awarded an injured worker is not dependent on
his ability to work, should be enacted.
 
Id. (emphasis added); see also S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 867-70,
 
in 1970 Senate Journal, at 1391. Besides the substitution of the
 word "man" for "person," the changes enacted by Act 100 in 1970
 remain in effect today. Although HRS § 386-32 has been revised
 several other times since 1970, a review of the amendments and
 corresponding legislative history reveals no contradiction to the
 legislature's intent as expressed above.
 
Ihara argues that a claimant's ability to work "must be
 
considered by the LIRAB in determining 'disability.'" This
 
argument appears to be based on the American Medical
 
Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment
 (AMA Guides) which classify "disability" as broader than
 
14
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"impairment." A "disability" is defined in the AMA Guides as "an
 
alteration of an individual's capacity to meet personal, social,
 or occupational demands or statutory or regulatory requirements
 because of an impairment." Am. Med. Ass'n., Guides to the
 
Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 8 (Linda Cocchiarella & Gunnar
 
B.J. Andersson, 5th ed. 2000). Thus, Ihara argues: 
... the fact of Employer's firing of Claimant because of his
medical disqualification is precisely the type of "work"
factor which must be considered by the LIRAB in determining
"disability."
 
The LIRAB's finding of fact of no impairment did not include
consideration of "work", and the work prohibition provided a
solid basis for a finding of PPD. 
However, while the AMA Guides are a helpful tool in 
determining disability, the LIRAB is not bound by them. See 
Cabatbat v. Cnty. of Haw., Dept. of Water Supply, 103 Hawai 'i 1, 
6, 78 P.3d 756, 761 (2003). Additionally, Ihara's argument 
conflicts with the clear legislative intent outlined above that PPD should not be based on a claimant's ability to work. 
If we accept that the LIRAB found that Ihara suffered
 
some impairment, but not in a ratable amount, its award of PPD
 benefits would still be in error. As the LIRAB accepted that
 Ihara suffered no ratable impairment, it had no basis for
 calculating compensation under the statute. HRS § 386-32(a) in
 essence provides that, when a disability is not comparable to a
 scheduled disability, "the permanent partial disability must be
 rated as a percentage of the total loss or impairment . . . ." 
(Emphasis added.) Here, Ihara's disabilities were not comparable
 to any scheduled disability. Therefore, they were disabilities
 which must have been rated as a percentage of the total loss or
 impairment. Further, HRS § 386-32(a) then commands that "the
 maximum compensation shall be computed on the basis of the
 corresponding percentage of the product of three hundred twelve
 times the effective maximum weekly benefit rate prescribed in
 section 386-31." (Emphasis added.) As the LIRAB failed to do
 this, its award of $250 is not based on any calculation
 authorized by the statute.
 
15
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Thus, whether the LIRAB found that Ihara was not
 
impaired at all or that he was impaired in some undetermined
 
amount, its award of PPD benefits was clearly wrong. Under HRS
 § 91-14(g) (2012), we thus vacate and remand the LIRAB's award of
 $250 in PPD benefits for a determination of whether Ihara
 suffered a permanent impairment, and if so, the percentage of the
 impairment and the award of PPD benefits based on that
 percentage.
 
B. VR Services
 HRS § 386-25(b) (Supp. 2014) provides that the director
 
may refer employees to VR "who may have or have suffered
 permanent disability . . . ." The DLNR challenges COLs 5 and 6
 which conclude that Ihara is entitled to VR services after
 October 20, 2008 and through at least August 17, 2009. These
 COLs are predicated on the conclusion that the DLNR's termination
 of Ihara for medical disqualification was an acknowledgment that
 he was permanently disabled. As discussed above, this conclusion
 was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law. Thus, we
 also vacate and remand the LIRAB's determination of Ihara's
 entitlement to VR services for a redetermination consistent with
 its final decision on the PPD issue. See Arruda v. Willocks
 
Const. Corp., No. CAAP-12-0000391, 2013 WL 6043902 at *5 (Haw.
 App. Nov. 15, 2013) (MOP) ("We cannot conceive of a scenario in
 which entitlement to vocational rehabilitation services can be
 resolved without addressing the issue of permanent disability.") 
C. Request for a Penalty
 On cross-appeal, Ihara challenges the LIRAB's FOF 32 
which says "The Board finds no credible evidence to support an assessment against Employer of a 20% penalty for untimely TTD benefit payments[,]" and its COL 3 concluding that the DLNR was not liable for a 20% penalty on TTD. "FOFs are reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision was clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record." Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i 
at 406, 38 P.3d at 574 (citations and brackets omitted). COL 3 is also reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard because its 
16
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conclusion that the DLNR is not liable for a penalty is a mixed
 
question of fact and law dependent on the facts and circumstances
 of this particular case. Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Planning Comm'n
 
of Kauai, 133 Hawai
'i 141, 164, 324 P.3d 951, 974 (2014). Here 
however, Ihara fails to cite to any evidence in the record which
 indicates that the LIRAB's FOF 32 or COL 3 were clearly
 erroneous.
 
HRS § 386-92 (Supp. 2014) provides: 
If any compensation payable under the terms of a final
decision or judgment is not paid by a self-insured employer
or an insurance carrier within thirty-one days after it
becomes due, as provided by the final decision or judgment,
or if any temporary total disability benefits are not paid
by the employer or carrier within ten days . . . after the
employer or carrier has been notified of the disability, and
where the right to benefits are not controverted in the
employer's initial report of industrial injury or where
temporary total disability benefits are terminated in
violation of section 386-31, there shall be added to the
unpaid compensation an amount equal to twenty per cent
thereof payable at the same time as, but in addition to, the
compensation, unless the nonpayment is excused by the
director after a showing by the employer or insurance
carrier that the payment of the compensation could not be
made on the date prescribed therefor owing to the conditions
over which the employer or carrier had no control.
 
(Emphasis added.) In the present case, the DLNR controverted
 
Ihara's entitlement to the subject benefits in its initial report
 of the injury and there was no finding that the DLNR stopped TTD
 payments in violation of HRS § 386-31. Thus, under HRS § 386-92,
 the 20% penalty could only be imposed if the DLNR failed to make
 any compensation payable under the terms of a final decision or
 judgment
. 
Also, payments authorized by the DLIR's supplemental
 
decision could not be considered overdue as the LIRAB granted a
 Motion for Stay of Payments following that decision. The record
 
reflects that the DLNR paid the $12,614.40 in TTD benefits
 
awarded by the DLIR's May 7, 2008 Decision. Ihara has not
 pointed to evidence that these payments were untimely and does
 not appear to argue that the DLNR failed to pay additional TTD
 benefits "upon receipt of medical certification" as ordered by
 the May 7, 2008 Decision. Ihara's only argument seems to be that
 payment for VR-TTD benefits should have been paid automatically
 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
pursuant to the DLIR's May 7, 2008 determination that Ihara
 
remained eligible for VR services. However, by its terms, the
 
May 7, 2008 Decision did not order VR-TTD payments, which
 
supports the LIRAB's FOF 32 that there was insufficient evidence
 to order a 20% penalty, and which also supports COL 3 that the
 DLNR was not liable for such a penalty. Thus, the LIRAB did not
 clearly err in its FOF 32 or COL 3. 
D. Attorney's Fees
 On cross-appeal, Ihara challenges the LIRAB's 
Attorney's Fee Approval and Order. He argues that while "the 'crucial issue' was correctly found by the LIRAB to be whether Claimant was entitled to permanent partial disability . . . , the LIRAB erred in holding that the Employer was the prevailing party." However, as we are remanding the PPD issue, it is not yet possible to make a determination as to who is the prevailing party. "In light of [our] remand, the LIRAB has yet to make a final Decision on the underlying worker's compensation claim. As such, any determination whether the employer 'loses' and, thus, is required to pay attorney's fees and costs is premature, i.e. not ripe." Kapuwai v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, Dep't. of 
Parks and Recreation, 121 Hawai
'i 33, 41, 211 P.3d 750, 758 
(2009). Thus, we must decline to address this issue and vacate and remand to the LIRAB to make a determination of attorney's fees pursuant to its final Decision. V. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the LIRAB's March
 
13, 2012 Decision as to its award of $250 in PPD benefits in COL
 4 and its determination that Ihara is entitled to VR services in
 COLs 5 and 6, and remand for proceedings consistent with this
 order. We also vacate the LIRAB's April 23, 2012 Attorney's Fee 
18

Approval and Order and remand for proceedings consistent with
 
this order.
