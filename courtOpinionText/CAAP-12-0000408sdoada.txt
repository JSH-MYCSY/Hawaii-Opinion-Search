IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JILLIAN MAY PAYNE, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-04393)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jillian May Payne (Appellant Payne)
 
appeals from the Order and Notice of Entry of Order (Order)
 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit (district
 
1
 court) on March 21, 2012, convicting her of Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1).
 
In this appeal, Appellant Payne asserts that her 
conviction must be vacated and the case dismissed because the complaint against her failed to allege a 
mens rea, as required 
under State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). 
Appellee State of Hawai' i (Appellee State) acknowledges 
that the OVUII charge regarding HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) was deficient

for failing to allege the requisite mens rea.2 Appellee State
 
contends the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the
 
district court with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge
 without prejudice. Appellant Payne does not appear to contest
 that dismissal should be without prejudice.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, and considering the
 relevant legal authorities, we resolve Appellant Payne's point of
 error as follows:
 
The OVUII charge alleging a violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) was insufficient for failing to allege a mens rea. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 53-58, 276 P.3d at 622-627. We agree 
with Appellee State that the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the district court for dismissal without prejudice. State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012) 
("Nesmith held that state of mind must be included in a charge or the case must be dismissed without prejudice."); State v. Castro, No. 30703, 2012 WL 3089722, at 1* n.3. (Haw. July 30, 2012) (SDO) ("Nesmith makes it clear that the remedy for the deficient HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charges is dismissal without prejudice.") 
Therefore,

 The parties do not dispute that although the complaint against
Appellant Payne alleged violations of both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3),
Appellant Payne was only arraigned under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). The district
 
court found Appellant Payne guilty of violating only HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) .

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order entered by the
 
district court on March 21, 2012 is vacated, and this case is
 
remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge without prejudice.
