Kadooka.2
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 21, 2001, Charlotte Ann Baba (Ms. Baba) saw
 
Dr. Kadooka for a pre-operation medical clearance. An
 
electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed on Ms. Baba's heart (March
 
21, 2001 EKG) and the computer reading indicated there was "sinus
 
rhythm, leftward axis, contour abnormality consistent with
 
inferior infarct, age unknown." Dr. Kadooka crossed out the
 
computer reading and wrote "WNL" (within normal limits). In the
 
medical records for the March 21, 2001 visit, Dr. Kadooka wrote:
 
"Comparison to Prior EKGs: Same."
 
Ms. Baba continued to visit Dr. Kadooka for routine
 
check-ups until September 20, 2002. On December 11, 2002, Ms.
 
Baba died of a heart-attack. Two autopsies were performed on Ms.
 
Baba, one on December 13, 2002 and another on January 9, 2003.
 
Both autopsies concluded Ms. Baba's death was heart-related. Dr.
 
Kadooka reviewed one or both reports but does not recall the date
 
of his review.
 
In a letter dated October 28, 2004, Robert J. Segal,
 
M.D., a medical expert for the Estate, advised the Estate to have
 
physicians with relevant expertise review the quality of care Ms.
 
Baba received.
 
On December 9, 2004, the Estate filed a claim with the
 
Medical Claims Conciliation Panel (MCCP). This claim was brought
 
2
 The Estate's contention that its Medical Claims Conciliation Panel 
claims tolled the statute of repose is not considered on appeal as the issue
was not raised below. See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940,
947 (2003) ("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument attrial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this ruleapplies in both criminal and civil cases."). 
Likewise, the Estate's constitutional arguments were not raised
below and are not considered on appeal. See State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573,
584, 827 P.2d 648, 655 (1992) (the "question of the constitutionality of a
statute cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.").

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
against five of Ms. Baba's doctors, including Dr. Kadooka, for
 
"(1) undiagnosed hypothyroidism, (2) failure to refer to a
 
thyroid specialist, (3) polypharmacy, and (4) failure of informed
 
consent." On December 29, 2005, the MCCP ruled against the
 
Estate. The Estate then consulted additional medical experts.
 
By October 27, 2007, one of the Estate's new medical
 
experts, Adrian Schnall, M.D. (Dr. Schnall), informed the Estate
 
that Dr. Kadooka misdiagnosed the March 21, 2001 EKG and deviated
 
from the standard of care in his treatment of Ms. Baba thereafter
 
(Dr. Schnall opinion). 
On March 24, 2008, Appellant filed a second claim with
 
the MCCP based on Dr. Kadooka's March 21, 2001 misdiagnosis. The
 
MCCP dismissed the claim a year later, concluding the statute of
 
limitations had expired. 
On October 22, 2009, over six years after Ms. Baba's
 
death, the Estate filed the complaint in the circuit court
 
against Dr. Kadooka from which this appeal arises. The Estate
 
alleged Dr. Kadooka's misdiagnosis of Ms. Baba's March 21, 2001
 
EKG was a fatal act of medical negligence and a proximate cause
 
of her death. The Estate also alleged Dr. Kadooka deviated from
 
the standard of care while treating Ms. Baba from March 21, 2001
 
until her death.
 
On June 28, 2011, Dr. Kadooka filed a Motion for
 
Summary Judgment. On October 27, 2011, the circuit court entered
 
an "Order Granting Extension of Time to Supplement Record." On
 
October 29, 2011, Dr. Kadooka's deposition was taken. Dr.
 
Kadooka testified that he believed his March 21, 2001 diagnosis
 
of Ms. Baba's EKG was correct until he reviewed the January 10,
 
2011 letter from his own expert, John J. Cogan, M.D. (Dr. Cogan). 
On February 29, 2012, the circuit court entered its
 
"Order Granting Defendant Craig E. Kadooka, M.D.'s Motion For
 
Summary Judgment Filed On June 28, 2011" and entered Judgment on
 
April 2, 2012. The circuit court granted summary judgment on the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
basis that the time in which the Estate could bring its medical
 
malpractice claim had expired under HRS § 657-7.3. On April 26,
 
2012, the Estate filed a notice of appeal from the April 2, 2012
 
Judgment under No. CAAP-12-0000420.
 
On June 5, 2012, the circuit court entered an amended 
judgment for the award of costs per Rule 54(d)(1) of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), leaving the substantive adjudication from the April 2, 2012 Judgment undisturbed.
3 On 
June 28, 2012, the Estate appealed the amended judgment under No. CAAP-12-0000604. On September 17, 2012, per Hawai' i Rules of 
4
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 45(f)(2),  this court consolidated the
two appeals under No. CAAP-12-0000604.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
We review summary judgments de novo. See Kamaka v. 
Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel
, 117 Hawai' i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 
91, 103 (2008). 
Under HRCP Rule 56(c), the circuit court must grant a
 
motion for summary judgment when the moving party: (1) has shown
 that there is no genuine issue regarding any material fact, and
 
(2) is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. "A fact is 
material if proof of that fact would have the effect of 
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause 
of action or defense asserted by the parties." Kamaka, 117 
Hawai'i at 104, 176 P.3d at 103. 
3 The circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enter the amended
judgment due to the appeal from the original judgment. See TSA Int'l Ltd. v. 
Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999). However, this
court has jurisdiction over both appeals per HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2012). 
4
 The Estate's opening brief violates HRAP Rule 28(b)(3),(4), and
(11) by failing to: (1) append copies of the judgments appealed from, (2) cite
the record to support each statement of fact, (3) properly set forth thepoints of error, and (4) include a Statement of Related Cases. Based on our review of the record we conclude the non-compliance is not material in thecircumstances of this case and our review reaches the merits. See Liki v. 
First Fire & Cas. Ins. of Hawaii, Inc., 118 Hawai' i 123, 126 n.3, 185 P.3d
871, 874 n.3 (App. 2008). Counsel for the Estate, however, is hereby warnedthat future violations may result in sanctions.

If the moving party meets its burden of production, the 
non-moving party must present admissible evidence showing 
specific facts about essential elements of each claim to avoid 
summary judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 
322-23 (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party; factual inferences are made in favor of 
the non-moving party. See Kamaka, 117 Hawai' i at 104, 176 P.3d 
at 103. 
Summary judgment is a drastic remedy and must be 
cautiously invoked to prevent the improper deprivation of a party's right to a trial on disputed factual issues. See GECC 
Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 79 Hawai' i 516, 521, 904 P.2d 530, 535 
(App. 1995) aff'd, 80 Hawai' i 118, 905 P.2d 624 (1995). Summary 
judgment should only be granted if the entire record shows a right to judgment with "such clarity as to leave no room for 
controversy and establishes affirmatively that the adverse party 
cannot prevail under any circumstances." Yamaguchi v. Queen's 
Med. Ctr., 65 Haw. 84, 91, 648 P.2d 689, 694 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. HRS § 657-7.3 Statute of Limitations
 
There are two statute of limitations periods at issue
 
in this case. HRS § 657-7.3 imposes a two-year statute of
 
limitations and a six-year statute of repose. The two-year
 
period begins when the "plaintiff discovers, or through the use
 
of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury[.]" 
HRS § 657-7.3. The six-year period starts on "the date of the
 
alleged act or omission causing the injury or death." Id. 
The legislature intended these limitations to balance
 
the conflicting interests of preventing stale claims and ensuring
 
that a party with a valid claim retains the opportunity to
 
present it. See Yamaguchi, 65 Haw. at 91, n.10, 648 P.2d at 694,
 
n.10. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor
 
of Dr. Kadooka was proper unless a genuine issue exists about
 
whether the statute of repose was tolled. The six-year statute
 
of repose is "tolled for any period during which the person has
 
failed to disclose any act, error, or omission upon which the
 
action is based and which is known to the person." 
HRS § 657-7.3. The specific question before us is whether any
 
genuine issue of material fact exists regarding Dr. Kadooka's
 
alleged knowledge and failure to disclose. The circuit court
 
held:
 
[I]n order for the relevant tolling provision of
HRS § 657-7.3 [] to apply, there must be a showing that [Dr.
Kadooka] had actual knowledge of [his] tortious act and
failed to disclose it.
 
[Dr. Kadooka's] deposition testimony is that he did
not believe that he was mistaken in his initial
 interpretation of the March 21, 2001 EKG results until after
he reviewed the report of [Dr. Cogan]. Dr. Cogan's report
is dated January 10, 2010. Therefore, based upon [Dr.
Kadooka's] deposition testimony, it was after January 10,
2010, that he "accepted the fact" that he had
"misinterpreted the [March 21, 2001] EKG[.]"[]
 
The [Estate] has not raised a genuine issue of
material fact showing that [Dr. Kadooka] had actual
knowledge of his misinterpretation of the EKG prior to the
six-year period following March 21, 2001. For example, [the
Estate] does not set forth any facts showing that [Dr.
Kadooka] had a motive to knowingly place incorrect entries
in the EKG printout and in Ms. Baba's medical records. It
 is implausible that [Dr. Kadooka] would knowingly alter the
[March 21, 2001] EKG printout and provide an improper
interpretation. This would have clearly have exposed [Dr.
Kadooka] to a civil action by Ms. Baba or her personal
representative and would not serve a useful purpose.
 
It is true that [Dr. Kadooka] reviewed one or both
autopsy reports. However, it does not set forth any
evidence showing that [Dr. Kadooka] went back to look at the
March 21, 2001 EKG printout after receiving the report or
reports. The [Estate] does not set forth any evidence
showing that [Dr. Kadooka] went back to review Ms. Baba's
medical records after receiving one or both of the autopsy
reports to see if he committed any errors in diagnosis or
treatment. The [Estate] does not set forth any evidence
which indicates that [Dr. Kadooka] had a habit of reviewing
medical records of a patient who has died to see if he
committed any errors in diagnosis or treatment.
 
(Emphasis added.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This holding erroneously makes factual inferences in 
favor of Dr. Kadooka. "The moving party's burden of proof is a 
stringent one, since the inferences to be drawn from the 
underlying facts alleged in the relevant materials considered by 
the court in deciding the motion must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party, and any doubt concerning the 
propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of 
the non-moving party." GECC Fin. Corp., 79 Hawai' i at 521, 904 
P.2d at 535 (citation omitted). 
Before the circuit court was evidence that Dr. Kadooka
 
had: (1) interpreted Ms. Baba's March 21, 2001 EKG as normal
 where the computer reading indicated otherwise; (2) indicated the
 
March 21, 2001 EKG results were the same as a prior EKG when the
 
results actually differed; and (3) reviewed the autopsy reports
 
indicating Ms. Baba suffered a heart-attack as early as December
 
2002.
 
The proper inference from these facts is that after Dr.
 
Kadooka learned of Ms. Baba's heart-related death, he could have
 
remembered altering the computer's interpretation of Ms. Baba's
 
EKG, a heart-related test, and concluded his earlier
 
interpretation was wrong. While it is reasonable to infer that
 
he did not, at the summary judgment stage, the inference must
 
favor the non-moving party. To infer that Dr. Kadooka, after
 
reviewing Ms. Baba's autopsy, needed to review Ms. Baba's medical
 
records to know that he committed an error is a factual inference
 
in favor of the moving party.
 
Dr. Kadooka contends, and the circuit court found, that
 
the Estate failed to bring forth admissible evidence showing
 
specific facts creating a genuine issue about Dr. Kadooka's
 
knowledge of the misdiagnosed March 21, 2001 EKG. This
 
contention, however, is only relevant if the moving party meets
 
its initial burden of production:
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing
support for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material
fact exists with respect to the essential elements of the
claim or defense which the motion seeks to establish or
 which the motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed
facts, it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law. Only when the moving party satisfies its initial
burden of production does the burden shift to the non-moving
party to respond to the motion for summary judgment and
demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general
allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial. 
GECC Fin. Corp., 79 Hawai' i at 521, 904 P.2d at 535 (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis added). 
Evidence presented by Dr. Kadooka to establish that no
 
genuine issues of material fact existed was that: (1) he did not
 
recall informing Ms. Baba that his EKG interpretation differed
 
from the computer's interpretation; (2) Ms. Baba's medical
 
records do not indicate she was so informed; and (3) he did not
 
accept the fact that he misdiagnosed the March 21, 2001 EKG until
 
he reviewed his expert's opinion in early 2011. Rather than
 
showing an absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding
 
whether Dr. Kadooka knew and failed to disclose the misdiagnosed
 
March 21, 2001 EKG, this testimony supports the conclusion that
 
such an issue exists. 
B. Knowledge of the Misdiagnosis
 
Given that the six-year statute of repose was tolled by
 
Dr. Kadooka's failure to disclose per HRS § 657-7.3, the next
 
question is when did the Estate have actual or constructive
 
knowledge of the misdiagnosed March 21, 2001 EKG?
 
Tolling of the statute of repose ceases when the
 
plaintiff acquires actual knowledge of the negligent act. See
 
Yamaguchi, 65 Haw. at 92, 648 P.2d at 694 ("His claim as to the
 misdiagnosis, moreover, is not saved by the statutory tolling
 
provision, since appellant had acquired actual knowledge of the
 
alleged negligent act from an independent source in 1961,
 
negating the defendants' duty to inform him of the same from that
 
date.").
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
 
the Estate, we conclude its complaint was filed within the six-
year statute of repose. The statute of repose began on March 21,
 
2001, the date of the EKG misdiagnosed by Dr. Kadooka, and ran
 
for approximately two years before it was tolled from around
 
December 13, 2002 or January 9, 2003, when Dr. Kadooka received
 
Ms. Baba's autopsy reports and reviewed one or both, to about
 
October 27, 2007, when the Estate received the Dr. Schnall
 
opinion; the statute of repose resumed running thereafter and did
 
not expire before the Estate filed its claim in circuit court. 
The two-year statute of limitations period begins when
 
the "plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable
 
diligence should have discovered, (1) the damage; (2) the
 
violation of the duty; and (3) the causal connection between the
 
violation of the duty and the damage." See Jacoby v. Kaiser
 
Found. Hosp., 1 Haw. App. 519, 525, 622 P.2d 613, 617 (1981). 
Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
 
the Estate, we conclude its complaint was filed within the two-
year statute of limitations. The two-year statute of limitations
 
period began around October 27, 2007, when the Estate received
 
the Dr. Schnall opinion, and ran for approximately six months
 
until March 24, 2008, when the Estate filed its second MCCP
 
5
Claim, and was tolled during the pendency this claim,  then ran
5 HRS § 671-18 (Supp. 2012) provides in relevant part:
 
§671-18 Statute of limitations tolled.  The filing of the
inquiry with the medical inquiry and conciliation
panel . . . shall toll any applicable statute of limitations, and
the statute of limitations shall remain tolled until sixty days
after the termination of the panel . . . . If panel proceedings
are not completed within twelve months, . . . the statute of
limitations shall resume running and the party filing the inquiry
may commence a suit based on the circumstances related to the
inquiry in any appropriate court of this State."
 
However, HRS § 671-18 does not toll the six-year statute of 
repose. When the MCCP statute was amended in 1980, the Hawai' i legislature
noted that S.B. No. 3003-80 would allow the statute of limitations to be 
(continued...)
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for about another six months before the instant complaint was
 
filed, well within the two-year statute of limitations. We are
 
therefore unable to conclude that the Estate cannot prevail under
 
any circumstance, precluding summary judgment.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, the Judgment entered April 2, 2012 and the
 
Amended Judgment entered June 5, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the
 
Third Circuit are vacated and this case is remanded for further
 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

tolled for no more than eighteen months, and would allow the party filing the
claim to commence suit after such eighteen-month period "but within the
balance of the 
original two-year period of limitation the party had before the
tolling was commenced." See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 546-80, in 1980 Senate
Journal, at 1252 (emphasis added). The eighteen month period was later
reduced to twelve months. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 959, in 2003 House
