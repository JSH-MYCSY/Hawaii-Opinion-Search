IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A., AS TRUSTEE FOR SECURITIZED ASSET BACKED
RECEIVABLES LLC TRUST 2006-FR2 MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES
 
SERIES 2006-FR2, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. GEORGE KAIPO AH CHONG,
JR., Defendant-Appellant, and JOHN and MARY DOES, 1-10,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-272)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this appeal arising from a complaint for ejectment,
 
Defendant-Appellant George Kaipo Ah Chong, Jr. (Ah Chong),
 
appeals pro se from the April 17, 2012 Judgment entered by the
 
1
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)  in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee for

 
Securitized Asset Backed Receivables LLC Trust 2006-FR2 Mortgage
 Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-FR2 (Wells Fargo).
 
On appeal, Ah Chong appears to argue that the Circuit

 
Court erred in (A) granting summary judgment because: (1) Wells
 Fargo did not mediate in good faith pursuant to the Foreclosure
 Mediation Pilot Project; (2) the Circuit Court did not set a time
 for Ah Chong to serve and file an answer to Wells Fargo's
 complaint after the failure of mediation; and (3) as a matter

law, Wells Fargo did not present evidence that it was a holder of
 
the October 7, 2005 Adjustable Rate Note; and (B) denying Ah
 Chong's Motion for Stay and Ex-Parte Motion for Immediate
 Emergency Stay without entering findings of fact and conclusions
 of law.

Upon carefully reviewing the record and the briefs 
submitted and having given due consideration to the issues raised and arguments advanced, we initially hold that the merits of the issues raised by Ah Chong will be addressed, notwithstanding his failure to comply with the requirements of Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b), inasmuch as this court favors a policy of affording pro se litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible. Housing Fin. & 
Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai
'i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 
1111-12 (1999). 
A. The Circuit Court did not err in granting Wells
 
Fargo's motion for summary judgment. 
1. Ah Chong has failed to support his claim that
 
Wells Fargo failed to mediate in good faith. It appears that
 Wells Fargo participated in the mediation and that a tentative
 "cash for keys" agreement had been reached, but that, a year
 later, Ah Chong was still on the property and had not signed the
 documents finalizing the agreement.
 
2. Ah Chong also argues that the Circuit Court 
never set a time frame in which he could file his answer to the complaint or dispositive motions as provided in the "Order Establishing Foreclosure Mediation Pilot Project in the Third Circuit of the State of Hawai
'i." (Order) In re Foreclosure 
Mediation Pilot Project, (September 29, 2009).3 As Ah Chong

 Ah Chong also argues that his appeal is adversely affected by the
Circuit Court clerk's failure to add the transcript from the March 22, 2012
hearing on Wells Fargo's February 16, 2012 Motion for Summary Judgment to the
Record on Appeal. However, this transcript was filed with this court, as
docket number 48, on November 19, 2012, three days after he ordered the
transcript for the purposes of the record on appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recognizes, the Circuit Court did not learn the parties were
 
unsuccessful in mediating the case--thereby triggering the need
 to set the time frame--until the hearing on the motion for
 summary judgment. More importantly, Ah Chong never contested in
 the Circuit Court the right of Wells Fargo to file the summary
 judgment motion, never objected to the Circuit Court that it had
 failed to set a time frame for an answer or dispositive motions,
 and does not explain why the failure to set such a time frame
 prevented him from responding to the motion. The transcript of
 the summary judgment hearing reveals that Ah Chong defaulted on
 the loan when he depleted his financial resources and "had no
 resources to pursue legal advice." He did not ask for more time
 to respond and does not now identify any defenses he would have
 raised had he been given time. Therefore, we conclude that
 Ah Chong waived his arguments about setting a time frame and also
 any error in failing to set a time frame to file an answer or
 dispositive motion was harmless.
 
3. Finally, Ah Chong's point of error regarding
 
the Adjustable Rate Note lacks merit. On March 1, 2010, Wells
 Fargo served Ah Chong with a "Notice of Mortgagee's Non-Judicial
 Foreclosure Under Power of Sale" which set the foreclosure sale
 date for April 29, 2010. At that time, non-judicial foreclosures
 were governed by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-5 (2008). 
HRS § 667-5 (2008) permits a mortgagee with a power of sale to
 conduct a non-judicial foreclosure upon breach if conducted
 pursuant to that statute's requirements. In particular, HRS
 § 667-5 (2008) requires the mortgagee's attorney to give proper
 notice to several parties and to file in the bureau of
 conveyances an affidavit setting forth the mortgagee's acts. See
 
HRS § 667-5(a), (b), (d). Ah Chong appears to argue that Wells
 Fargo failed to show it had possession of the note underlying the
 mortgage. We disagree. Wells Fargo submitted the Mortgagee's
 Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of Sale (Mortgagee's
 Affidavit) as an exhibit to its summary judgment motion, which
 states that Wells Fargo is the holder of the Adjustable Rate
 Note. Ah Chong never objected to the admission of the
 Mortgagee's Affidavit and under HRS § 667-8, the Mortgagee's
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Affdavit was admissible as evidence that the power of sale was
 
duly executed. We therefore conclude Ah Chong's argument to be
 without merit.
 
B. As we have rejected Ah Chong's challenges to the
 
granting of summary judgment, his argument regarding the failure
 of the Circuit Court to issue findings in support of its denial
 of a stay pending appeal is moot.
 
Therefore, the April 17, 2012 Judgment entered by the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
