HELEN CHRISTINA HICKMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-397)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Helen Christina Hickman (Hickman)
 
appeals pro se from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's1
 
(Circuit Court) March 21, 2012 Final Judgment. This case arises
 
out of the action for, inter alia, partition and sale of property
 
located in Pahoa, Hawai 'i brought by Plaintiff-Appellee, Donna 
Rae Stratman.
 
On appeal, Hickman appears generally to argue that
 
the Circuit Court erred in the manner in which the present

 
lawsuit was handled.2 After a careful review of the record, the

 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.

 Hickman's Opening Brief does not conform to Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 in that her "Statement of Error" section
does not provide record quotations of the rulings, findings, or conclusionsshe intends to challenge, nor does she provide record citations for herobjections to or preservation of the errors she claims. "Nonetheless,inasmuch as 'this court has consistently adhered to the policy of affordinglitigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, wherepossible,' we address the issues [raised] on the merits."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arguments made by the parties and the applicable authority, we
 
reject Hickman's arguments and affirm.
 
1. In her first argument, Hickman appears to argue
 
that the Circuit Court adjudicated an unwritten contract,
 
contrary to the Statute of Frauds, Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
ch. 656. However, as Hickman fails to identify to what unwritten
 
agreement she refers3
 we conclude her argument is without merit.
2. Hickman next appears to argue her due process 
rights under the Hawai 'i State and United States Constitutions 
were violated by misrepresentation "effected by agents of the circuit court" and "inappropriate processing." However, a 
careful review of Hickman's argument reveals that she has 
identified no specific findings of fact or conclusions of law 
that she claims are "fraught with mis-representation and outright 
lies" and in any event, she does not explain why she asserts they 
are in error. Moreover, as Hickman has not made a transcript of 
the trial part of the record on appeal, we cannot meaningfully 
review her claim. See Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. 
App. 256, 266, 799 P.2d 60 66-67 (1990), (disregarding the defendant's arguments that the lower court erred as to various 
motions and instructions because the defendant failed to provide 
a transcript of the proceedings below or satisfy the requirements 
of HRAP Rule 28); State v. Goers, 61 Haw. 198, 600 P.2d 1142 
(1979), (trial court's findings left undisturbed because the 
appellant failed to provide a transcript of the proceedings).

(quoting 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558
(1995)). 
Due in part to the brief's deficiencies, it is difficult to
discern the nature of her claims. Nevertheless, we will endeavor to ascertain
and address the alleged errors Hickman presents in her brief. We decline,
however, to address "all other related errors of record not presented in this
brief" as requested by Hickman.

 Hickman also refers to "Rule 17 Id." in her argument, but does not
specify to which set of rules she refers, nor does she explain how this rule
applies. Therefore, we disregard the same.

Similarly, we cannot review Hickman's claim that she
 
presented evidence of misrepresentation at an October 7, 2011
 
proceeding as no transcript of that proceeding has been included
 
in the record on appeal.
 
In addition, to the extent Hickman is asserting that
 
the trial should have been postponed based on a report from her
 
doctor faxed to the Circuit Court on the morning of trial, we
 
conclude the claim is without merit. The record does not reveal
 
a request of any kind, by Hickman or anyone else, to continue the
 
trial.
 
Finally, notwithstanding her reliance on an affidavit 
she allegedly filed in the record, the lack of any argument 
establishing how even an unchallenged set of averments support 
her arguments, Hickman has failed in her burden of showing error.

Hawai'i 277, 309 n.21, 172 P.3d 1021, 1053 n.21 (2007); Costa v. 
Sunn, 5 Haw. App. 419, 430, 697 P.2d 43, 50–51 (1985). 
Therefore, the March 21, 2012 Final Judgment entered by
 
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
