Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Gao's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
The HLRB properly dismissed Gao's claims that the AG
 
engaged in unfair labor practices. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 377-9 (1993) ("Prevention of unfair labor practices") states:
 
"No complaints of any specific unfair labor practice shall be
 
considered unless filed within ninety days of its occurrence." 
HRS § 337-9(l); see also Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR)
 
§ 12-42-42.2
 
The undisputed facts in the record establish that Gao
 
received a written reprimand on October 9, 2007, a thirty-day
 
suspension without pay on December 10, 2007, and termination on
 
January 20, 2009. Gao filed his complaint to the HLRB on August
 
26, 2010, more than ninety days after the last disciplinary
 
action, and was thus untimely.
 
Gao argues the ninety-day statute of limitations began
 
to run from the May 28, 2010 issuance of an arbitration decision
 
which denied Gao's grievances and affirmed the AG's disciplinary
 
action against him. His argument is unavailing because his
 
prohibited practice claims were based on the disciplinary actions
 
taken against him, and not on the arbitration decision itself. 
His complaint to the HLRB stated: "The disciplinary actions
 
against me in 2007 and 2009 violated [HRS § 89-13 (2012 Repl.)
 
("Prohibited practices; evidence of bad faith")]." (Emphasis
 
added.). To the extent Gao claims his employer's testimony at
 
2
 HAR § 12-42-42 states:
 
(a) A complaint that any public employer, public employee,
or employee organization has engaged in any prohibited
practice, pursuant to section 89-13, HRS, may be filed by a
public employee, employee organization, public employer, or
any party in interest or their representatives within ninety
days of the alleged violation.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arbitration constituted a prohibited practice, such claims
 
are also time-barred because Gao filed his complaint more than
 
ninety days after the arbitration hearings. Therefore, we
 
conclude the circuit court properly affirmed the HLRB's order
 
dismissing Gao's prohibited practice claims as untimely.
 
The HLRB also properly concluded it lacked jurisdiction 
to vacate the arbitration decision. Gao's complaint to the HLRB 
challenged the arbitration decision by alleging the decision was 
based on false testimony by the AG's witnesses. HRS Chapter 
658A, the Uniform Arbitration Act, governs review of arbitration 
awards, and under HRS § 658A-23 (2012 Repl.) ("Vacating award"), 
only a court may vacate an arbitration decision and award for the 
reasons set forth in the statute. Neither HRS § 89-5 (2012 
Repl.) ("Hawai' i labor relations board") nor HRS § 89-13 gives 
the HLRB jurisdiction to vacate an arbitration award. 
The HLRB also properly concluded that, pursuant to the 
unit 13 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) terms, Gao is bound by the arbitration award. "[W]here the terms of public 
employment are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
pursuant to HRS Chapter 89 (1993) and the agreement includes a 
grievance procedure to dispose of employee grievances against the 
public employer, an aggrieved employee is bound by the terms of 
the agreement." Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Bd., 97 Hawai' i 
528, 537, 40 P.3d 930, 939 (2002). Here, Article 11 of the CBA governs the grievance procedure and states: "[T]he decision of 
the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Union, its 
members, the Employees involved in the grievance and the 
Employer." (Emphasis added.). Thus, Gao could not relitigate 
the arbitration decision before the HLRB by requesting a review 
of his employer's testimony. 
Lastly, the HLRB properly dismissed Gao's claims for
 
violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and of
 
the AG's workplace violence policies. "An administrative agency
 
can only wield powers expressly or implicitly granted to it by
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statute." Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 
173, 184, 86 P.3d 982, 993 (2004) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). The HLRB's jurisdiction over controversies concerning 
prohibited or unfair labor practices is grounded in HRS Chapters 
89 and 377, which do not include jurisdiction to determine 
violations of the ADA or of workplace violence policies. 
Therefore, the circuit court properly affirmed the HLRB 
decision and did not err in denying Gao's motion to vacate, alter 
or amend the judgment pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59. 
The circuit court also did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Gao's motion for reconsideration. The purpose of a
 motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new
 
evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented
 
during the earlier adjudicated motion; however, the trial court
 
does not abuse its discretion in denying the motion if the
 
arguments and evidence supporting the motion could and should
 
have been produced earlier. Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber
 
Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114-15, 839 P.2d 10, 27 (1992). Gao's
 motion for reconsideration raised only one new argument, claiming
 
his termination was not consistent with the grievance procedure
 
required under HRS § 89-10.8 (Supp. 2010). This argument could
 
and should have been raised during his appeal to the circuit
 
court and does not affect the correctness of the HLRB's decision
 
regarding the untimeliness of Gao's complaint.
 
The circuit court also properly denied Gao's motion for
 
a new trial pursuant to HRCP Rule 59. The provisions Gao cited
 
in support of his motion do not apply to an agency appeal. HRS
 
§ 635-56 (Supp. 2010) and HRCP Rule 59 allow new trials in an
 
action in which there has been a trial. Gao did not file a
 
direct action in the circuit court, and there has been no trial. 
Furthermore, the instant case is an agency appeal governed by HRS
 
§ 91-14 (Supp. 2010). HRS § 91-14 does not provide for a trial
 
before the circuit court based on an appeal from an HLRB
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
decision. Under HRS § 91-14(f), judicial review is confined to 
the record except where a trial de novo is provided by law. Pele 
Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 64, 70, 881 
P.2d 1210, 1216 (1994). No statute provides for a trial de novo 
in an appeal from an HLRB decision. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that based on the foregoing, the
 
February 27, 2012 Judgment; April 13, 2012 "Order Denying
 Appellant's Motion to Reconsider the Order Affirming Decision and
 
Dismissing Appeal, Filed on February 6, 2012, Filed on February
 
10, 2012;" and April 24, 2012 "Order Denying Appellant's Motion
 
to Vacate, Alter or Reverse the Judgment Filed on Feb. 27, 2012;
 
and Motion for New Trial, Filed on March 6, 2012" all filed in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.
