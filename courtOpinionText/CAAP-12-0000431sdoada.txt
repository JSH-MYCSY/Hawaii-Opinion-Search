IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JACOB HARGITT, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-11-082323)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley and Reifurth, JJ., with
Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jacob A. Hargitt ("Hargitt")
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment filed on April 3, 2012 in the District Court of the
 First Circuit, Wahiawa Division ("District Court").
1
 
On appeal, Hargitt contends that (1) the District Court
 
plainly erred by not dismissing the charge of Excessive Speeding
 because the charge was deficient for failing to allege the
 requisite mens rea, (2) the District Court abused its discretion
 by admitting evidence of a laser gun reading because the State
 failed to provide sufficient foundation for its admission, and
 (3) without the laser gun reading there was insufficient evidence
 to convict him of Excessive Speeding.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Hargitt's points of error as follows:

I. Background
 
On December 1, 2011, Hargitt was issued a citation for
 
Excessive Speeding, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
("HRS") ยง 291C-105(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2011). On April 3,
 2012, Hargitt was orally arraigned on the sole count of Excessive
 Speeding. The oral charge did not state the requisite mens rea
 for a charge of Excessive Speeding. Hargitt, however, did not
 object to the charge. 
That same day, the District Court held a bench trial. 
Hargitt testified therein that, as a military police officer, he
 had been trained to use speed-detecting devices, including a
 device similar to that which Officer Jeremy Franks ("Officer
 Franks") used to clock his speed. Hargitt further testified that
 he had been traveling approximately 65 to 70 miles per hour when
 Officer Franks clocked his speed, and given that Officer Franks
 was roughly 900 feet away and several other cars were proximate
 to Hargitt's car, it was likely that Officer Franks had clocked a
 different vehicle. Hargitt also objected to the admissibility of
 the laser gun evidence. The District Court found Hargitt guilty
 as charged. 
II. Discussion
 
"HRS ยง 291C-105(a) is not a strict liability offense, 
but instead requires that the State prove that a defendant acted 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly." State v. Gonzalez, 128 
Hawai'i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012). A charge for 
violating HRS ยง 291C-105(a) that does not state the requisite state of mind is insufficient pursuant to State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 324, 
288 P.3d at 798. 
"[W]hen a party raises an objection to the indictment 
for the first time on appeal the indictment is liberally construed." State v. Tominiko, 126 Hawai' i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 
1122, 1130 (2011) (citing State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 90, 657

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 1019, 1019 (1983)).2 "This standard means we will not
 
reverse a conviction based upon a defective indictment unless the
 
defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within
 reason be construed to charge a crime." Id. (quoting Motta, 66
 
Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020) (internal quotation marks omitted).
 The liberal construction approach applies to oral charges. State
 
v. Hitchcock, 123 Hawai' i 369, 378, 235 P.3d 365, 374 (2010) 
(citing State v. Elliott, 77 Hawai' i 309, 311, 884 P.2d 372, 374 
(1994)). 
Under Motta's liberal construction approach, "one way 
in which an otherwise deficient count can be reasonably construed to charge a crime is by examination of the charge as a whole." Id. (quoting Elliott, 77 Hawai' i at 312, 884 P.2d at 375) 
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Additionally, "in determining whether the accused's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him [or her] has been violated, we must look to all of the information supplied to him [or her] by the State to the point where the court passes upon the contention that the right has been violated." Id. at 379, 
235 P.3d at 375 (brackets in original) (quoting State v. Israel, 78 Hawai' i 66, 70, 890 P.2d 303, 307 (1995)) (emphasis omitted). 
Upon review of the record on appeal here, the mens rea
 
requirement was in no manner stated in the charge nor mentioned
 at any time prior to the District Court's pronouncement of
 Hargitt's guilt, whereupon it stated that Hargitt had acted with
 the requisite state of mind. We cannot reasonably construe the
 charge, even when considering all other information provided to
 Hargitt prior to the District Court's adjudication, as alleging
 that he committed the crime knowingly, intelligently, or
 recklessly.

 This court has applied the Motta standard on plain error review
where the alleged charge deficiency is the lack of mens rea. See, e.g., State
 
v. Sabala, No. CAAP-12-0000357, 2013 WL 1687547, at *2-3 (Haw. Ct. App. Apr.
17, 2013). The parties do not dispute applicability of this standard here.

 We decline to take up the State's invitation to evaluate whether
Hargitt's testimony effectively mounted a defense establishing that he only
negligently drove excessively fast as this would amount to nothing more than
conjecture as to what Hargitt might have known regarding the charge against
him. In any event, we do not understand Hargitt to have mounted a negligence

Hawai'i at 313, 884 P.2d at 376.4 Thus, the charge cannot 
reasonably be construed to state a crime, even under the liberal 
construction standard. Therefore, the charge was deficient and must be dismissed without prejudice.
5 Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i at 
324, 288 P.3d at 798. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on April 3, 2012 in
 the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiawa Division, is
 vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the
 case without prejudice.

defense; he asserted that he was driving 65 to 70 miles per hour and that,
therefore, Officer Franks must have clocked the wrong car.

 Elliott also involved application of Motta's liberal construction 
standard. Elliott, 77 Hawai' i at 311, 884 P.2d at 374. We do not find 
significant the State's distinction that the resisting arrest statute in
Elliott specified a mens rea of "intentionally," whereas the statute at issue
here specified no mens rea at all.

 Because we vacate Hargitt's conviction, we need not reach his other
points of error.
