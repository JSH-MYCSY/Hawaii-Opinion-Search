SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant David Velez (Velez) appeals from
 
the April 23, 2012 (post-judgment) Order Denying Defendant David
 
Velez's Motion to Dismiss Complaint Pursuant to HRCP 12(b)(1)
 
Filed Herein on January 24, 2012 (Order Denying Dismissal),
 
entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit, South Kohala
 
Division (District Court).1
 
On appeal, Velez raises two points of error, asserting
 
that the District Court erred: (1) when it denied Velez's pro se
 
motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction; and (2)

 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.

when it denied Velez's Rule 60(b)(3) and (4) motion for relief
 
from judgment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
(1) As stated in this court's December 14, 2012 Order
 
Denying October 31, 2012 Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary
 
Affirmance, the District Court's October 5, 2011 Judgment for
 
Possession was final and immediately appealable pursuant to HRS
 
ยง641-1(a). Velez did not timely file a notice of appeal from the
 
judgment for possession. Therefore, Velez is not entitled to
 
appellate review of the judgment for possession or the District
 
Court's pre-judgment orders, including the September 27, 2011
 
Order Denying Defendant's Challenge of Jurisdiction. 
As further stated in this court's December 14, 2012 
Order Denying October 31, 2012 Motion to Dismiss and/or for 
Summary Affirmance, we have appellate jurisdiction to review the 
District Court's Order Denying Dismissal. To the extent that 
Velez challenges the Order Denying Dismissal, this appeal is 
without merit. Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that 
claims involving the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai 'i laws 
are without merit. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in State v. Kaulia, 
128 Hawai 'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013), recently 
reaffirmed this principle: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the court's
jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the Kingdomgovernment. In that regard, we reaffirm that "[w]hatever maybe said regarding the lawfulness" of its origins, "the Stateof Hawai' i . . . is now a lawful government." State v. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664
(App.2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004).
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and notof the State are not exempt from application of the State'slaws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77 
Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State v. French, 77 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994); Nishitani v. Baker,
82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App. 1996); State v. Lee, 90 
Hawai'i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
(2) Velez also contends that the District Court erred 
when, on June 28, 2012, it orally denied relief pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b). However, as 
acknowledged in Velez's jurisdictional statement, no written order was entered on this matter. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 4(a)(5) provides that "[a] judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the 
court." A district court's "oral decision is not an appealable 
order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 
(2005). Although district court minutes may reflect a district court's oral announcement of a ruling, "a minute order is not an 
appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming, & Wright, 
88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis 
added). 
Accordingly, the District Court's January 24, 2012 
Order Denying Dismissal is affirmed.
