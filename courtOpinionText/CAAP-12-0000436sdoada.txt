Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession
 Filed March 22, 2012, which awarded Plaintiff-Appellee OWB REO,
 LLC ("OneWest") a writ of possession for the property located on
 Mamalahoa Highway in Hakalau, Hawai

for Possession; and the Writ of Possession, entered by the
 District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo

On appeal, Hill argues that the District Court erred
 
when it:3/
 
(1) "denied [Hill] consideration of his challenge to
subject matter jurisdiction, [the] burden of proof of
which is the responsibility of the claimant"; 
(2) granted "summary judgment . . . because 'there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact that the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'";
 
(3) denied Hill his constitutionally guaranteed right to
face his accuser under the 6th Amendment; 
(4) "denied [Hill's] demand [for] trial by jury (7th
Amendment)";
 
(5) "grant[ed] summary possession [to OneWest because] it
[overrode] Hill's objections and motions resulting in
[] violations of the Constitutionally preserved rights
enumerated in the 4th Amendment (unlawful searches and
SEIZURES), 5th Amendment (due process of law), 6th
(right to face my accuser) and 7th (right to trial by
jury) amendments to the [U]nited States Constitution
and a violation of article 6 which in part states that
the Constitution is the supreme law of the land"; 
(6) "denied [Hill's] motion for evidentiary hearing wherein
these defects could have been further enumerated"; and
 
(7) issued its judgment because "[a]ny judgment in conflict
with the Constitution makes the judgment VOID . . . ,
the courtroom constitutionally defective and [] warring
against the constitution as [if the judge had] violated
her oath of office."
 
Hill also argues that:
 
(8) "[OneWest] CANNOT hold both mortgage and note as
required for standing as the note has been securitized
and sold as a pool of mortgages to investors"; and
 
(9) "[OneWest] did not have standing to foreclose as it was
not the holder of the note and mortgage" like the
plaintiffs in Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v.
 
Williams, Civil No. 11-00632JMS/RLP, 2012 WL 1081174
(D. Haw. March 29, 2012). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
3/
 Hill's points of error were rewritten and reorganized for clarity.
 
2
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 
Hill's points of error as follows,4/ and affirm:
 
(1) In Hill's first point of error, he argues that the
 
District Court erred in "dismiss[ing]" his motion to challenge
 jurisdiction "without discussion or justification" and without
 requiring OneWest to prove that the District Court has subject
 matter jurisdiction over the case. We disagree.
 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 604-5(a) 
(Supp. 2013), district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions involving summary possession or ejectment. However, district courts do not have jurisdiction over "actions in which the title to real estate comes in question[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 604-5(d); see Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai
'i 32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 1132 (2011) (upholding the 
district court's jurisdiction because appellant failed to properly put title at issue). 
To put title into question such that a district court 
no longer has jurisdiction to issue writs of possession or ejectment, the party defending the action must comply with Hawai
'i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure ("HDCRCP") Rule 
12.1, which states: 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in defense of an
action in the nature of an action of trespass or for the
summary possession of land, or any other action, the defendant
shall seek to interpose a defense to the jurisdiction to the
effect that the action is a real action, or one in which the
title to real estate is involved, such defense shall be
 asserted by a written answer or written motion, which shall
not be received by the court unless accompanied by an
affidavit of the defendant, setting forth the source, nature
and extent of the title claimed by defendant to the land in
question, and such further particulars as shall fully apprise
the court of the nature of defendant's claim.
 
See Peeula, 126 Hawai 'i at 36–37, 265 P.3d at 1132–33. In order 
to satisfy HDCRCP Rule 12.1, the defendant must submit both a 
4/
 OneWest argues that Hill failed to comply with Hawaii Rules of
Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28, and his opening brief should thereforebe stricken in accordance with HRAP Rule 30. "This court, however, hasconsistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to
have their cases heard on the merits, where possible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004)
(quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai'i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361,
364 (1994)). Accordingly, we will address the merits of the issues raised by
Hill to the extent we can, notwithstanding any violations of HRAP Rule 28.

written answer or written motion and an affidavit or declaration 
asserting "the source, nature, and extent of [the] claim."  Aames 
Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai 'i 95, 98-99, 110 P.3d 1042, 
1045-46 (2005) (quoting another source) (internal quotation marks omitted) (determining that because appellant did not adhere to the HDCRCP Rule 12.1 requirements, it failed to properly raise the lack-of-subject-matter-jurisdiction defense). 
During the April 4, 2012 Hearing on OneWest's motion
 
for summary judgment ("MSJ Hearing"), the District Court observed
 that Hill had not filed the appropriate pleading under HDCRCP
 Rule 12.1. Rather than filing a written answer or a written
 motion with the court in advance, Hill brought documents to the
 hearing because he had been told that it was "most appropriate." 
After the parties presented their arguments on the
 
merits, the District Court found that Hill had failed to submit
 both a written answer or motion, and an affidavit or declaration
 setting forth the source, nature and extent of the title claimed
 by Hill to the land in question as required by HDCRCP Rule 12.1. 
Moreover, it concluded that Hill did not provide "any facts,
 material facts that show that what [OneWest is] claiming [is] in
 issue." Therefore, the District Court dismissed Hill's motion
 challenging jurisdiction.
 
Even if we consider the "Challenge of Jurisdiction" 
submitted by Hill during the MSJ Hearing, that document does not challenge the nonjudicial foreclosure in any way, does not contain an affidavit or declaration, and does not "set forth the source, nature, and extent of title with particularity" or "apprise the [District Court] fully of the nature of his claim" as it must. Peelua, 126 Hawai
'i at 39, 265 P.3d at 1135. 
Therefore, the District Court did not err in denying Hill's request to dismiss OneWest's motion for summary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
(2) In his second point of error, Hill contends that
 
the District Court erred when it determined that summary judgment
 was appropriate because Hill had not "presented any material
 facts that would prevent [the court] from granting [OneWest's]
 Motion for Summary Judgment." We conclude, however, that OneWest
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
presented sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden as the
 
movant, but that Hill failed to identify a genuine issue of
 material fact to defeat the motion.
 
We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de 
novo. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai
'i 28, 41, 313 
P.3d 717, 730 (2013) (quoting Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai 'i 116, 
136, 19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001)). As the moving party, OneWest has the "initial burden of production." Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass'n v. 
Medeiros, No. CAAP-12-0000024, 2013 WL 1905086, *3 (Hawai
'i App. 
May 7, 2013) (citing Stanford Carr Dev. Corp., v. Unity House, Inc., 111 Hawaii 286, 296, 141 P.3d 459, 469 (2006)) (affirming the district court's order granting summary judgment in an ejectment action in favor of the plaintiff, when defendants made unsupported allegations that the plaintiff's affidavit and deed were fraudulent). If the initial showing is satisfied, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish that genuine issues of material fact exists. Id. 
In order to maintain its ejectment action, OneWest
 
"must necessarily prove that it owns the parcels in issue," State
 v. Magoon, 75 Haw. 164, 175, 858 P.2d 712, 718-19 (1993), meaning that OneWest must have "the title to and right of possession of" the parcel. Carter v. Kaikainahaole, 14 Haw. 515, 516 (Terr. 
1902); Aames Funding, 107 Hawai
'i at 104, 110 P.3d at 1051 
(stating that insofar as plaintiff is the record owner of the property, plaintiff was entitled to a writ of ejectment). In addition, plaintiff must establish that "possession is unlawfully withheld by another." Carter, 14 Haw. at 516. 
By providing the District Court with a copy of its own 
quitclaim deed, OneWest satisfied its initial burden of showing that it had clear title to the Property, superior to that of Hill. 
The burden then shifted to Hill to "come forward, through 
affidavit or other evidence, with specific facts showing that there [wa]s a genuine issue of material fact." Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 65, 828 P.2d 286, 292 (1991) (citing K.M. Young & Assoc. v. Cieslik, 4 Haw. App. 657, 675 P.2d 793 (1983)). As the District Court correctly concluded, Hill failed to do so. See 
Castro, 131 Hawai
'i at 41-42, 313 P.3d at 730-31 (determining 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that the district court properly granted summary judgment in 
favor of plaintiff because defendants did not produce evidence to demonstrate issues related to title); but cf. Konduar Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawai
'i 227, 361 P.3d 454 (2015) 
(determining that an ejectment action in circuit court that addresses issues related to title requires additional consideration of the factors found in Ulrich v. Security Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Terr. 1902)). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in granting OneWest's motion for summary judgment and writ of possession because there were no genuine issues of material fact. 
(3) Hill's remaining points of error based on alleged 
violations of the Hawai
'i or U.S. Constitutions, violations of 
the District Court judge's oath of office, or other arguments not raised below or supported now on appeal, are either waived or without merit. 
Therefore, the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession Filed March 22, 2012, the
 Judgment for Possession, and the Writ of Possession, entered on
 April 19, 2012 by the District Court of the Third Circuit, North
 and South Hilo Division, are affirmed.
