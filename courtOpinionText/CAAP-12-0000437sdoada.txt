IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
FAIR HORIZON LLC, Plaintiffs-Appellees,
v.
 
KEONI K. AGARD, LYNETTE L. AGARD, Defendants-Appellants.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-3052)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendants-Appellants Keoni K. Agard and Lynette L.
 
Agard (Agards) appeal from a "Judgment on Order Granting
 
Plaintiff Fair Horizon LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed
 Herein on February 17, 2012, and For Possession" (Judgment) and a
 "Writ of Possession" (Writ) entered against them and in favor of
 Plaintiff-Appellee Fair Horizon LLC (Fair Horizon), both filed on
 April 3, 2012, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit
 court).
1 The Judgment and Writ were entered pursuant to the
 
circuit court's grant of a summary judgment motion filed by Fair
 Horizon. 
In their points of error, the Agards assert that the
 
circuit court erred by granting summary judgment for Fair
 Horizon, issuing the Judgment, and issuing the Writ.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
 Agards' appeal as follows and affirm.
 
In a related case, Agard v. Deutsche Bank National
 
Trust, Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Civil No. 11-1-0362­02, now on appeal in CAAP-13-2872 (hereafter CAAP-13-2872),
 Lynette Agard filed a complaint against several entities,
 including the foreclosing entity Deutsche Bank National Trust
 Company, as Trustee of the IndyMac INDX Mortgage Loan Trust 2006­AR14, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-AR14 under
 the Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated October 1, 2006
 (Deutsche Bank), alleging inter alia wrongful foreclosure and
 unfair or deceptive practices.

In this case, we address the Agards' contentions that
 
(1) Fair Horizon was not a bona fide purchaser; and (2) Fair Horizon does not hold good title because Deutsche Bank had defective title and thus improperly foreclosed on the subject property. Although these issues were addressed by the parties below, it is unclear on what basis the circuit court granted summary judgment. Because the circuit court granted summary judgment to Fair Horizon, we review its grant of summary judgment de novo. Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc., 111 
Hawai
'i 286, 295, 141 P.3d 459, 468 (2006).
(1) Based on our review of the record, Fair Horizon 
established that it was a bona fide purchaser in that it purchased the property in good faith for value and without notice of any title defects, and it is entitled to possession of the property. See Lee v. HSBC Bank USA, 121 Hawai
'i 287, 291, 218 
P.3d 775, 779 (2009) (noting that "[nonjudicial foreclosure

Services, Inc. and OneWest Bank, FSB.

sales] are final between the parties and conclusive as to bona
 
fide purchasers[]"). 
The undisputed evidence establishes that, at a
 
nonjudicial foreclosure auction held on March 3, 2011, Fair
 Horizon was the highest bidder and tendered a non-refundable
 deposit of $65,000 towards the purchase price of the subject
 property, with the belief that it was acquiring good title.
 According to the affidavits of Fair Horizon's president, Gerald
 Mount, Jr. (Mount), and vice-president of operations, Gregory
 Dunn (Dunn), they believed Fair Horizon was acquiring good title
 to the property at the auction and they were not aware of any
 challenges to, or any actual or alleged problems with, the
 foreclosure at the time of the public auction. 
On March 18, 2011, the Mortgagee's Affidavit of 
Foreclosure Under Power of Sale (Mortgagee's Affidavit), listing Fair Horizon as the successful purchaser, was filed with the State of Hawai
'i Bureau of Conveyances (Bureau). Under Hawai 'i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667–8 (1993), which was applicable at 
3
the time of the nonjudicial foreclosure in this case,  the
Mortgagee's Affidavit "shall be admitted as evidence that the power of sale was duly executed." 
See U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. 
Castro
, 131 Hawai 'i 28, 40, 313 P.3d 717, 729 (2013) ("That the 
affidavit shall be admitted as evidence that the power of sale was duly executed demonstrates the legislature's intent to promote the finality of properly conducted sales.") (citation and quotation marks omitted). 
Pursuant to the undisputed affidavits of Mount and
 
Dunn, it was not until April 4, 2011, that Fair Horizon became
 aware that Lynette Agard had filed a complaint against Deutsche
 Bank.
4 Moreover, the Agards do not contend that a lis pendens
 
was recorded at the time of the nonjudicial foreclosure auction. 
3
 HRS § 667-8 was repealed in 2012.
 
4
 Lynette Agard's initial complaint in CAAP-13-2872 was filed on
February 17, 2011.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Instead, it appears that a lis pendens was not filed by Lynette 
Agard until March 12, 2012, over a year after the nonjudicial foreclosure auction.
5 See HRS § 634-51 (Supp. 2012); IndyMac 
Bank v. Miguel, 117 Hawai 'i 506, 521, 184 P.3d 821, 836 (App. 
2008) ("The doctrine of lis pendens is intended to protect a claimed interest in property from being defeated by a subsequent sale to a bona fide purchaser during the course of litigation."). Thus, the evidence submitted by Fair Horizon shows that it purchased the property in good faith for value at the public auction, without notice of any title defects, and that the Mortgagee's Affidavit was filed before Fair Horizon had any knowledge of Lynette Agard's lawsuit. 
When a party moving for summary judgment satisfies its 
initial burden of production, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that present a genuine issue of material fact to be decided at trial. Stanford Carr, 111 Hawai
'i at 296, 141 P.3d at 
469.
 
The Agards contend that Fair Horizon failed to take in 
good faith and without notice because it learned of the related litigation before the Limited Warranty Deed was recorded on November 3, 2011. This assertion does not affect Fair Horizon's status as a bona fide purchaser because the recording of the Mortgagee's Affidavit in March 2011 is evidence that the power of sale was duly executed. HRS § 667–8; Castro, 131 Hawai
'i at 40, 
313 P.3d at 729; see also Melendrez v. D & I Inv., Inc., 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 413, 427 (App. 2005) ("[I]nformation learned after the acquisition does not affect the buyer's [bona fide purchaser] status."). 
5
 The record on appeal in CAAP-13-2872 contains a lis pendens filed by
Lynette Agard on March 12, 2012, in her lawsuit against Deutsche Bank, et al.
Pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) 201, we take judicial notice of
that document in the related action. It is unclear from that record if the
 
lis pendens was recorded.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Summary judgment in favor of Fair Horizon was thus
 
proper because Fair Horizon was a bona fide purchaser of the
 
property.
 
(2) Because we conclude that Fair Horizon was a bona
 
fide purchaser, we need not address the Agards' other contention
 that Deutsche Bank did not have good title to foreclose on the
 property. We note, however, that this issue and the same
 arguments raised by the Agards in this case are addressed in the
 Summary Disposition Order in CAAP-13-2872. As noted therein,
 this court did not find merit in the Agards' claims.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment for Possession
 
and the Writ of Possession, both entered on April 3, 2012, by the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are affirmed.
