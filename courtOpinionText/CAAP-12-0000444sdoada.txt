STATE OF HAWAI
'I, BY ITS DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN
HOME LANDS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CORWIN D.K. PEDRO and TINA L. KAHALEWAI-PEDRO,
Pro Se Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAIANAE DIVISION
 
(DC CIVIL NO. 1RC-12-1-1055)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Corwin D.K. Pedro and Tina L.
 
Kahalewai Pedro (Appellants) timely appeal from the Judgment for
 
Possession and Writ of Possession, both entered on March 22,
 
2012, by the District Court of the First Circuit, Waianae
 
Division (District Court).1
 
On appeal, Appellants do not properly raise any points 
of error and their briefs otherwise fail to comply with Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b) & (d). Nevertheless, 
Hawai'i's appellate courts have "consistently adhered to the 
policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible." Schefke v. Reliable 
Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 
(2001) (citation and quotation marks omitted).

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we address
 
Appellants' appeal as follows:
 
It appears that Appellants are arguing that the title 
to the subject property is in issue. The record demonstrates, 
however, that Appellants failed to raise a title dispute as a 
defense to possession in this case. Under District Court Rules 
of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1, defendants may raise a 
title dispute as a defense. DCRCP Rule 12.1 sets out 
requirements to prevent abuse of this defense. Deutsche Bank 
Nat'l Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai' i 32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 
1132 (2011). Rule 12.1 requires a defendant to provide an 
affidavit stating the "source, nature and extent of the title 
claimed by defendant" and "further particulars as shall fully 
apprise the court of the nature of defendant's claim." DCRCP 
Rule 12.1 (2012). The purpose of the affidavit is to provide the 
court with information to discern the interest claimed by the 
defendant. Peelua, 126 Hawai' i at 37, 265 P.3d at 1133. Bare 
assertions are insufficient to sustain a claim that title is at issue so as to divest the District Court's jurisdiction. Id. at 
38, 265 P.3d at 1134. Here, Appellants failed to submit, at any time, an affidavit providing the particulars about the source, 
nature or extent of their claim to title. Accordingly, the 
District Court did not err in entering the Judgment for 
Possession and Writ of Possession.

For these reasons, the District Court's March 22, 2012 
Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession are affirmed.
