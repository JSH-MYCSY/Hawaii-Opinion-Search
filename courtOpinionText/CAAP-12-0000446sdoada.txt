NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
CWMBS, Inc., CHL Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006­
12 and against Johnson.
 
In summary, Johnson contends the district court erred
 
in failing to conclude that the question of title raised by
 
Johnson divested the district court of subject matter
 
jurisdiction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Johnson's appeal is without merit. 
Johnson contends the district court failed to dismiss
 
the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where Johnson
 
identified a question of title to the property. Under Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes § 604-5(d) (Supp. 2012), "district courts shall
 
not have cognizance of real actions, nor actions in which the
 
title to real estate comes into question[.]" When a defendant
 
seeks to assert a question of title as a defense, the defendant
 
must raise the defense in a written answer or motion and attach
 
an affidavit that describes the "source, nature, and extent of
 
the title claimed by defendant[.]" District Court Rules of Civil
 
Procedure Rule 12.1. 
Johnson submitted an affidavit with her written motion, 
however, the affidavit failed to identify any question of title. 
In her affidavit, Johnson claimed a title issue arose when a 
fraud perpetuated by the Bank of America caused her to send 
mortgage payments to the incorrect entity. In Deutsche Bank Nat. 
Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai 'i 32, 34, 265 P.3d 1128, 1130 
(2011), a respondent in a foreclosure proceeding filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The 
respondent filed an affidavit claiming that a question of title 
arose from allegedly fraudulent transactions committed by the 
foreclosing mortgagor. Id. at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134. The Supreme 
Court of Hawai
'i found the respondent's assertions conclusory and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deemed respondent's affidavit insufficient to establish any
 
question of title. Id. This is the case here.
 
Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Johnson's Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 60(b) motion based on the affidavit of Teri L. Pettit. Johnson's motion failed to demonstrate due diligence in the 
discovery of the evidence set forth in the Pettit affidavit. 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai
'i 214, 
259-60, 948 P.2d 1055, 1100-01 (1997). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the order entered April 5,
 
2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit denying
 "Defendants Arna Lahela Johnson And Geralyn Lapitan Camarillo's
 
Motion to Vacate All Orders And For Summary Judgment For Lack of
 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction" is affirmed.
