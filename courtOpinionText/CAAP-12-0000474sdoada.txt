APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0390)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Lynette K. Niau (Lynette) and
 
Leedon K. White, Sr. (Leedon) (collectively, Appellants) appeal
 
from the Judgment filed on April 10, 2012 (Judgment) in the
 
1
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court), and
challenge the Circuit Court's order granting summary judgment in
 
favor of Defendant/Cross-Claimant-Appellee Arch Bay Holdings,
 LLC, Series 2009C (Arch Bay) and against Appellants.
 
Appellants raise three points of error on appeal,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) granting Arch
 Bay's motion for summary judgment in light of Appellants' claims

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Truth In Lending Act (TILA) violations and Appellants' notice
 
of rescission; (2) concluding that there were no genuine issues
 
of material fact regarding alleged violations under Chapter 480,
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), which included claims of fraud,
 
unfair and deceptive acts and practices, and breach of contract;
 
and (3) concluding that there were no genuine issues of material
 fact regarding Appellants' ability to pay the alleged outstanding
 debt.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Appellants' points of error as follows:
 
(1) "TILA provides two remedies for loan disclosure
 
violations—rescission and civil damages, each governed by
 separate statutory procedures." 
Meritt v. Countrywide Fin.
 
Corp., 759 F.3d 1023, 1029-30 (9th Cir. 2014) (footnote omitted). 
We first address Appellants' claim for damages under TILA.
 
The declared purpose of [TILA] is "to assure a
meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer
will be able to compare more readily the various credit
terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of
 credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and
unfair credit billing and credit card practices." 15 U.S.C.
 § 1601(a); 
see Mourning v. Family Publications Service, 
Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 363–368, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 1657–1660, 36
L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). Accordingly, [TILA] requires creditors
to provide borrowers with clear and accurate disclosures of
terms dealing with things like finance charges, annual
percentage rates of interest, and the borrower's rights.
See §§ 1631, 1632, 1635, 1638.
 
Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai 'i 213, 223, 11 
P.3d 1, 11 (2000) (quoting Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523 U.S.
 
410, 412–13 (1998)). 15 U.S.C. § 1632(a) (2012) provides:
 
(a) Information clearly and conspicuously disclosed; "annual
percentage rate" and "finance charge"; order of disclosures
and use of different terminology
Information required by this subchapter shall be
disclosed clearly and conspicuously, in accordance with
regulations of the Bureau. The terms "annual percentage
rate" and "finance charge" shall be disclosed more
conspicuously than other terms, data, or information
provided in connection with a transaction, except
information relating to the identity of the creditor.
Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section,
regulations of the Bureau need not require that disclosures
pursuant to this subchapter be made in the order set forth
in this subchapter and, except as otherwise provided, may
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
permit the use of terminology different from that employed
in this subchapter if it conveys substantially the same
meaning.
 
15 U.S.C. § 1632(a); see also 12 C.F.R. § 1026.18.
 
Here, Appellants alleged in the Complaint, and in
 
opposition to summary judgment, that the loan transaction
 
involved "inconsistent and confusing disclosure statements with
 materially misstated annual percentage rate disclosures and
 materially misstated itemizations of amounts financed[.]" 
The Federal Truth-In-Lending Disclosure Statement dated
 
February 21, 2007 listed the following: (1) an APR of 12.814%;
 (2) a Finance Charge of $1,214,300.84; (3) an Amount Financed of
 $407,177.81; (4) a Total of Payments of $1,621,478.65; (5) the
 number of monthly payments; (6) the amount of each monthly
 payment; and (7) the due dates of each monthly payment. The
 Itemization of Amount Financed dated February 21, 2007 listed the
 total Amount Financed as $407,177.81 and a Prepaid Finance Charge
 of $21,722.19. 
The only other evidence Appellants presented in support
 
of their allegations that the loan documents and disclosures were
 "inconsistent and confusing" and contained "materially misstated
 annual percentage rate disclosures and materially misstated
 itemizations of amounts financed" was Lynette's Declaration,
 which merely recited the same allegations. On appeal, Appellants
 restate these allegations, citing only to Lynette's Declaration
 and to the argument section of the memorandum in opposition to
 Arch Bay's Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
Federal courts have held that "[t]he legal inquiry
about the quality of disclosure is not directed at whether
the credit consumer was actually confused or misled. . . .
The court must engage only in an objective inquiry into the
violation of specific provisions of TILA requirements."
Jenkins v. Landmark Mortgage Corp. of Virginia, 696 F. Supp.
1089, 1095 (W.D.Va.1988) (citing Powers, 542 F.2d at 1219).
Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that "[s]trict
compliance does not necessarily mean punctilious compliance
if, with minor deviations from the language of [TILA], there
is still a substantial, clear disclosure of the fact or
information demanded by the applicable statute or
regulation." Smith v. Chapman, 614 F.2d 968, 972 (5th Cir.
 
1980). Thus, in ruling that a particular manner of
disclosure violated TILA, the courts have invariably
discussed why the disclosure was confusing, misleading, or
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
otherwise potentially detrimental to the borrower. See,
 
e.g., Jenkins, supra.
 
Keka, 94 Hawai 'i at 225, 11 P.3d at 13. Appellants do not 
specify in what way the loan documents were "inconsistent and
 
confusing" or how they "materially misstated annual percentage
 rate disclosures and materially misstated itemizations of amounts
 financed." For example, Appellants did not state what the
 correct APR should have been or allege that the itemization of
 amounts financed omitted certain amounts that should have been
 listed.
 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(e) 
provides, in relevant part:
 
When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as
provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon
the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's
pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or
as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific
facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If
 
the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if
appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.
 
(Emphases added). Appellants' bare allegations and the
 
conclusory statements in Lynette's Declaration are insufficient
 to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether TILA
 violations occurred.
2
 
Arch Bay also argues that Appellants' Complaint for
 
TILA damages was untimely and must fail as a matter of law. We
 
2 See, e.g., Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Castle, 79 Hawai' i 64, 91,
898 P.2d 576, 603 (1995) ("Bare allegations or factually unsupported
conclusions are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, andtherefore, insufficient to reverse a grant of summary judgment.") (citationomitted); Briggs v. Hotel Corp. of Pac., Inc., 73 Haw. 276, 281 n.5, 831 P.2d1335, 1339 n.5 (1992) ("Memorandum of counsel and an affidavit that is merelyan assertion of conclusions which are filed by the non-moving party are notsufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on a motion for summaryjudgment.") (citation omitted); Henderson v. Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72 Haw.387, 401, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991) ("A party opposing a motion for summaryjudgment cannot discharge his or her burden by alleging conclusions, 'nor ishe entitled to a trial on the basis of a hope that he can produce someevidence at that time.' 10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice andProcedure, Civil 2d § 2727 (1983)."); Chuck Jones & MacLaren v. Williams, 101Hawai'i 486, 501, 71 P.3d 437, 452 (App. 2003) (plaintiffs' "conclusory
statements [in a declaration], in and of themselves and devoid of specificsupporting facts, were not sufficient to raise [a] genuine issue of materialfact[,]" and "[b]ecause these statements were the only averments in oppositionto the motion[,]" the court affirmed the granting of summary judgment.).

agree. Under 15 U.S.C. § 1640,  civil liability claims for TILA
damages must be brought "within one year from the date of the
 
occurrence of the violation[.]" 
15 U.S.C. § 1640. Such claims
 
are subject to the one-year statute of limitations set forth in §
 1640(e), not the extended three-year rescission period set forth
 in 15 U.S.C. § 1635(f) (2012).
4 Additionally,
 
For violations of TILA's disclosure requirements, the period
begins to run "when the plaintiffs executed their loan
documents, because they could have discovered the alleged
disclosure violations and discrepancies at that time."
Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 656 F.3d 1034,
1045 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1640(e)); see also
King v. California, 784 F.2d 910, 915 (9th Cir. 1986)
(stating that the limitations period begins to run from the
date of consummation of the loan). . . . Plaintiff's TILA
damages claim is time-barred unless Plaintiff can
demonstrate that equitable tolling applies.
 
Young v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 848 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1191-92 (D.
 
Haw. 2012); see also Rowland v. Novus Fin. Corp., 949 F. Supp.
 1447, 1455 (D. Haw. 1996) ("[T]he one-year statute of limitations
 runs from the date on which the parties consummated the loan[,] .
 . . absent some showing by the Plaintiff that the court should
 toll the period because the Defendant fraudulently concealed its
 disclosure violations.") (citation omitted).
 
Appellants executed the loan documents on February 21,
 
2007. Appellants filed the Complaint on February 22, 2010. 
3 15 U.S.C. § 1640(e) provides, in relevant part:
 
(e) Jurisdiction of courts; limitations on actions; State
attorney general enforcement
Except as provided in the subsequent sentence, any
action under this section may be brought in any United
States district court, or in any other court of competent
jurisdiction, within one year from the date of the
occurrence of the violation[.]

Thus, their TILA damages claims were time-barred under 15 U.S.C.
 
§ 1640(e).
 
We next address Appellants' purported rescission of the
 
Note and Mortgage.
 
One protection available to consumers under TILA is a
right of rescission in any consumer credit transaction in
which a security interest is acquired in property used as
the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is
extended; this "buyer's remorse" provision extends for three
business days following consummation of the transaction or
delivery of the relevant disclosures to the consumer. 15
 
5
U.S.C. § 1635(a).[ ]
TILA requires that creditors clearly and conspicuously
disclose information regarding the right to rescind and
provide borrowers with appropriate forms to exercise this
right. 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a). Where a creditor fails to make
 the required disclosures under TILA, the act extends the
borrower's right to rescind for three years after
consummation of the subject transaction. 15 U.S.C.
 § 1635(f).
 
E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai 'i 154, 157-58, 296 P.3d 
1062, 1065-66 (2013) (footnotes omitted). 
Regulation Z, issued by the Federal Reserve Board,
implements TILA's requirements and describes the right of
rescission as follows: 
The consumer may exercise the right to rescind until
midnight of the third business day following the
occurrence described in paragraph (a)(1) of this
 
5 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a) (2012) provides:
 
(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind
Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the
case of any consumer credit transaction (including opening
or increasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan)
in which a security interest, including any such interest
arising by operation of law, is or will be retained or
acquired in any property which is used as the principal
dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the
obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction
until midnight of the third business day following the
consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the
information and rescission forms required under this section
together with a statement containing the material
disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is
later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with
regulations of the Bureau, of his intention to do so. The
 creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in
accordance with regulations of the Bureau, to any obligor in
a transaction subject to this section the rights of the
obligor under this section. The creditor shall also
 provide, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau,
appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right to
rescind any transaction subject to this section.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
section that gave rise to the right of rescission,
delivery of the notice required by paragraph (b) of
this section, or delivery of all material disclosures,
whichever occurs last. If the required notice and
 
material disclosures are not delivered, the right to
 
rescind shall expire 3 years after the occurrence
 giving rise to the right of rescission, or upon
 transfer of all of the consumer's interest in the
 property, or upon sale of the property, whichever
 occurs first. . . .
 
12 C.F.R. § 226.15(a)(3) (emphasis added).
 
This court previously described the contours of TILA's
requirements and remedies in Hawaii Community Federal Credit
Union v. Keka,
 94 Hawai' i 213, 11 P.3d 1 (2000), where we
explained:
 
[ ] TILA requires creditors to provide borrowers
with clear and accurate disclosures of terms dealing

with things like finance charges, annual percentage
rates of interest, and the borrower's rights. Failure
 to satisfy TILA subjects a lender to criminal
penalties for noncompliance, . . . as well as to
statutory and actual damages traceable to a lender's
failure to make the requisite disclosures. . . .
Going beyond these rights to damages, TILA also
authorizes a borrower whose loan is secured with his
 principal dwelling, and who has been denied the
requisite disclosures, to rescind the loan transaction
entirely, until midnight of the third day following
the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of
the information and rescission forms required under
this section together with a statement containing the
material disclosures required under this subchapter,
whichever is later. TILA provides, however, that the
borrower's right of rescission shall expire three
years after the date of consummation of the
transaction or upon the sale of the property,
whichever occurs first, even if the required
disclosures have never been made. TILA gives a
borrower no express permission to assert the right of
rescission as an affirmative defense after the
 expiration of the 3–year period.
 
94 Hawai' i at 223, 11 P.3d at 11 (internal citations,
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
Id. at 158 n.7, 296 P.3d at 1066 n.7 (brackets and ellipses in
 
original).
 
Appellants here argue that the three-year extended
 
rescission period is applicable because the loan documents

 
allegedly contained "inconsistent and confusing disclosure
 statements that misstated their annual percentage rates and
 itemizations of amounts financed."
6   Courts have held that "[t]he
 
right to rescind is not dependent upon the one year statute of

 
6
 Appellants do not contend that they did not receive proper notice
of their right to rescind the loan.
 
7

limitations period for a claim for damages. Thus, appellants may
 
have a right to rescind even though their claim for damages is
 barred by the statute of limitations in 15 U.S.C. [§] 1640(e)." 
Rudisell v. Fifth Third Bank, 622 F.2d 243, 248 (6th Cir. 1980)
 (footnote and internal citation omitted). However, because
 
Appellants' argument that they were entitled to rescind was based
 
on the premise that TILA violations occurred, and Appellants
 failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether
 such violations occurred, Appellants failed to raise a genuine
 issue of material fact as to whether they were entitled to the
 three-year extended rescission period. Thus, their right to
 rescind expired on February 26, 2007, three business days after
 the consummation of the loan transaction, and the purported
 rescission through the November 21, 2008 letter was untimely and
 ineffective. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in
 determining that there are no genuine issues of material fact as
 to Appellants' claims that they were entitled to TILA damages
 from Arch Bay or they had properly rescinded the Note and
 Mortgage under TILA.
 
(2) Appellants contend that Arch Bay's predecessor,
 
Quick Loan, engaged in "numerous unfair and deceptive acts and
 practices, including placing [Appellants] in a more expensive
 loan than they previously had," falsified their loan
 application, and failed to verify Appellants' income.
 
As this court recently noted:
 
An injury resulting from a[n unfair or deceptive act
or practice] must be "fairly traceable to the defendant's
actions." Flores v. Rawlings Co., LLC, 117 Hawai' i 153, 167
n.23, 177 P.3d 341, 355 n.23 (2008) (citation and internalquotation marks omitted). Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 9(b) requires all averments of fraud or mistake to setforth circumstances constituting fraud or mistake withparticularity. "The rule is designed, in part, to insurethe particularized information necessary for a defendant toprepare an effective defense to a claim which embraces awide variety of potential conduct." Larsen v. Pacesetter 
Sys., Inc.,
 74 Haw. 1, 30, 837 P .2d 1273, 1288 (1992),
amended on reh'g in part, 74 Haw. 650, 843 P.2d 144 (1992)(citation omitted). General allegations are insufficient,"[a] plaintiff must state the circumstances constitutingfraud or mistake with particularity (e.g., allege who madethe false representations) and specify the representationsmade." Larsen, 74 Haw. at 30–31, 837 P.2d at 1288 (citing

WL 337254 at *2 (App. Jan. 26, 2015) (SDO) (reconsideration
 denied, No. CAAP–13–0002872, 2015 WL 630973 (App. Feb. 12,
 2015)).
 
HRS § 480-3.1 (2008) limits civil liability to "[a]ny
 
person, firm, company, association, or corporation violating any
 of the provisions of section 480-2[.]" See also Young, 848 F.
 
Supp. 2d at 1192-93 (holding that allegations of HRS Chapter 480
 violations, "even if supported by evidence, are legally
 insufficient as to any Defendant other than [the originating
 lender].") It is undisputed that Arch Bay was not involved in
 the original loan transaction and was not the originating lender.
 Thus, Arch Bay cannot be held liable for damages under HRS
 Chapter 480 based on Quick Loan's purported acts. Similarly,
 Arch Bay cannot be held liable for Quick Loan's purported fraud,
 as it made no representations, false or otherwise, to Appellants
 regarding the loan origination and consummation.
7
 
8
Citing HRS § 480-12,  Appellants also argue that, even
if Arch Bay cannot be held liable for HRS Chapter 480 damages,
 the alleged violations rendered the Note and Mortgage void and
 unenforceable.  This court has held that
 
[a] contract or agreement in violation of HRS Chapter 480 is
void and unenforceable. See HRS § 480–12. [Debtor's]
mortgage and loan transaction fell "within the ambit of HRS[Chapter] 480, inasmuch as (1) a loan extended by afinancial institution is activity involving conduct of anytrade and commerce and (2) loan borrowers are consumerswithin the meaning of HRS § 480–1 [(2008 Repl.)]." Hawaii

Although Appellants provided various documents related
 
to the Note and Mortgage, they do not point to any evidence to
 
support their allegations or specify where in the included
 documents the violations occurred. Lynette's Declaration, the
 only other evidence provided, contained only conclusory
 allegations. The Declaration did not specify in what way the
 disclosure statements were "inconsistent and confusing" or how
 the annual percentage rates and itemizations of amounts financed
 were misstated in the disclosure statements. It also lacked any
 specific statements about how the loan application was
 "falsified," and did not point to any particular documents in the
 
record for support.9 Thus, Appellants failed to raise a genuine
 
issue of material fact as to whether the Note and Mortgage were
 void and unenforceable due to HRS Chapter 480 violations.
10
 
(3) Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erred in
 
determining that there were no genuine issues of material fact
 regarding Appellants' ability to pay the alleged outstanding
 debt. However, Appellants failed to provide any evidence of TILA
 
9 In contrast, in Karpeles, the borrowers alleged that they were
 
presented with a completed Uniform Residential Loan Application
 
and that they signed the form but did not notice that the
form falsely stated that their combined monthly income was
$9,500, when in fact, their combined monthly income was
$2,547. [The borrowers] also claimed that after signing the
Notice of Right to Cancel, they were handed blank copies
which differed from the notices that they had signed.
 
Karpeles Manuscript Library v. Duarte,
 129 Hawai
'i 90, 91, 294 P.3d 1076, 1077
(App. 2013). This court did not reach the merits of the borrowers' HRS Chapter 480 claims in that case. 
10
 In contrast, in Keka, the supreme court held that even though the 
record contained "very scanty evidence of the circumstances surrounding the[debtors'] loan transaction[,]" the debtors' averments were sufficient toraise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the lender negotiated theloan in a deceptive manner. Keka, 94 Hawai' i at 229, 11 P.3d at 17.
The debtors specifically alleged that prior to closing, the Credit Union
loan officer represented that the loan would bear a seven and one-fourth
percent interest rate rather than the nine percent rate actually charged at
closing, and that at the time of closing, the loan officer represented that it
would be "no problem" to lower the rate "when the in house rate changes,"
which the Credit Union later disavowed. Id. at 227, 11 P.3d at 15.

disclosure violations other than Lynette's conclusory 
Declaration. Cf. Karpeles, 129 Hawai 'i at 91-92, 294 P.3d at 
1077-78 (borrowers provided evidence to support their TILA claims by attaching as an exhibit copies of the two notices of right to cancel they received, which both "lacked a signature for an Acknowledgment of Receipt and lacked a date informing [borrowers] of the time period in which they might exercise their right to cancel"). Because they were unable to show any TILA disclosure violations, Appellants were not entitled to TILA's extended three-year rescission period under 15 U.S.C. § 1635(f), and their right to rescind lapsed on February 26, 2007 under 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a). Insofar as Appellants were no longer entitled to rescission when they sent the November 21, 2008 letter purporting to rescind to Quick Loan and Citigroup, Appellants' ability to repay the outstanding balance was not at issue on summary judgment. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in declining to find any genuine issue of material fact as to whether Appellants were able to repay the outstanding balance. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's April 10, 2012
 
Judgment is affirmed.
