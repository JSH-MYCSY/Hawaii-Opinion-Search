On appeal, Edens contends that (1) the Circuit Court
 
erred when it failed to instruct the jury on the offense of
 
desecration,3/ and (2) that, absent that instruction, the jury
 
instructions were prejudicially insufficient. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment and resolve Edens's points of error as
 follows:
 
(1) "When jury instructions or the omission thereof 
are at issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading." State v. Pond , 118 Hawai
'i 452, 461, 193 P.3d 368, 
377 (2008) (quoting State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 335, 141 
P.3d 974, 982 (2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Circuit Court instructed the jury on the choice of evils defense. Edens, however, argues that the instructions were insufficient because the Circuit Court declined to further instruct the jury on the offense of desecration. We disagree. 
We conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that 
the Circuit Court did not err in instructing the jury on the choice of evils defense without also instructing the jury on the offense of desecration because (a) the choice of evils defense does not require that the greater harm or evil to be avoided be criminal in nature, see, e.g., State v. Jim, 105 Hawai 'i 319, 
328-29, 97 P.3d 395, 404-05 (App. 2004) (harm or evil was the alleged improper administration of the Hawaiian Home Commission Act); (b) the evidence indicated that the State's actions were authorized and there was no evidence to the contrary to suggest that the State's actions constituted desecration, State v. 
3/
 Edens proposed that the jury be instructed as follows:
 
A person commits the offense of desecration if the person
intentionally desecrates a burial.
 
"Desecrate" means defacing, damaging, polluting, or
otherwise physically mistreating in a way that the defendant
knows will outrage the sensibilities of persons likely to
observe or discover the defendant's action.

Padilla, 114 Hawai 'i 507, 515–16, 164 P.3d 765, 773–74 (App. 
2007) (holding that defendant suffered no prejudice from the 
circuit court's refusal to give instructions on other defenses, when defense was adequately covered by choice of evils instruction); and (c) instructing the jury on the crime of desecration would likely have served to mislead or confuse the jury, see State v. Keohokapu, 127 Hawai' i 91, 113, 276 P.3d 660, 
682 (2012). Thus, the Circuit Court properly refused to give the proposed instruction on the offense of desecration. 
(2) For the reasons expressed above, the Circuit
 
Court's instructions were not prejudicially insufficient.
 
Therefore,
 The Judgment; Guilty Conviction and Sentence filed on
 
April 17, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is
 affirmed.
