 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1
Circuit  (circuit court) in favor of Appellees-Appellees Board of
Land and Natural Resources (BLNR), the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (DLNR), William J. Aila, Jr., the State of 
Hawai'i (State), and Parker Ranch, Inc. (Parker Ranch) 
(collectively, Appellees). 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal arises from the BLNR's extension of three
 
pasture leases (collectively, Leases) to Parker Ranch. 
The
 
Leases were set to expire on February 28, 2011. Pursuant to
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 171-36(b) (2011 Repl.), Parker
 
Ranch requested that the BLNR extend the Leases by twenty years. 
After conducting a site visit to the leased property and
 
determining Parker Ranch's compliance with the lease provisions
 
of HRS Chapter 171 (2011 Repl.), the DLNR staff recommended that
 
the BLNR extend the Leases by twenty years.
 
The BLNR held regularly scheduled meetings on February
 
11 and February 25, 2011. The meetings' agendas listed the
 
extension of each of the three Leases as agenda items. During
 
both meetings, Wille and other members of the community presented
 
oral and written testimony. After considering the testimony and
 
the DLNR staff report, the BLNR unanimously agreed to extend the
 
terms of all three Leases by twenty years.
 
Wille submitted petitions for a contested case hearing
 
on February 16 and March 7, 2011, challenging the BLNR's
 
extension of the Leases. In her petitions, Wille stated she
 
lived "immediately adjacent to one of the subject parcels" and
 
wanted access over the leased parcels "to hike for pleasure and
 
health." Wille also claimed a "cultural-[aesthetic] interest in 
1

2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not being surrounded by a place of extraordinary beauty that is
 
bordered by no trespassing signs, especially when those places
 
are of historic and cultural significance."
 
On May 13, 2011, the BLNR held a regularly scheduled
 
meeting listing Wille's petitions as an agenda item. After
 
considering Wille's written testimony and a DLNR staff report,
 
the BLNR unanimously agreed to deny Wille's petitions for a
 
contested case hearing.
 
On June 9, 2011, Wille filed a notice of appeal to the 
circuit court, appealing the BLNR's decision to extend the Leases 
and to deny Wille's request for a contested case hearing. 
Wille's notice of appeal claimed jurisdiction under HRS § 91­
14(a) (2012 Repl.), Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
72(a), Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 13-1-1(h), and article XII, section 4 of the Hawai' i Constitution. The circuit court 
heard oral arguments on December 12, 2011 and ruled in favor of Appellees. The circuit court then entered the March 14, 2012 
"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Dismissing 
Appellant Margaret Wille's Appeal" and the April 19, 2012 "Final 
Judgment," from which Wille timely appealed. 
On appeal, Wille contends (1) the circuit court had 
jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a) and article XII, section 
4 of the Hawai' i Constitution (2) the BLNR's grant of a twenty-
year lease extension was not an "internal management" matter and therefore was not exempt from HRS Chapter 91 (2012 Repl.)'s 
provisions; (3) the lease extension was a "disposition" of public 
land under HRS § 171-13 (2011 Repl.) and therefore triggered 
public access rights under HRS § 171-26 (2011 Repl.); and (4) the 
BLNR proceedings failed to provide sufficient due process with 
respect to public access rights under HRS § 171-26. Because we 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4conclude the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we
affirm.
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
A. Circuit Court Jurisdiction
The circuit court's authority to hear the instant
matter and, in turn, [the appellate court's] authority to
review the circuit court's rulings are questions of subject
matter jurisdiction.  "Whether a court possesses subject
matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de
novo."  Hawai# i Mgmt. Alliance Ass'n v. Ins. Comm'r, 106
Hawai#i 21, 26, 100 P.3d 952, 957 (2004) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted); see also Int'l Bhd. of Painters
& Allied Trades, Local Union 1944 v. Befitel, 104 Hawai# i
275, 281, 88 P.3d 647, 653 (2004) ("Subject matter
jurisdiction is concerned with whether the court has the
power to hear a case."  (Internal quotation marks and
citation omitted.)).  We further note that:
The lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter
cannot be waived by the parties.  If the parties do
not raise the issue, a court sua sponte will, for
unless jurisdiction of the court over the subject
matter exists, any judgment rendered is invalid.
Chun v. Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai# i, 73
Haw. 9, 14, 828 P.2d 260, 263 (1992) (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted).  When reviewing a case to
determine whether the circuit court has jurisdiction, [the
appellate court] "retains jurisdiction, not on the merits,
but for the purpose of correcting the error in
jurisdiction."  Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai# i 152, 159, 977
P.2d 160, 167 (1999) (citation omitted).
Tamashiro v. Dep't of Human Services, State of Hawai# i, 112
Hawai#i 388, 398, 146 P.3d 103, 113 (2006) (brackets in original
omitted).
B. Statutory Interpretation
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law
to be reviewed de novo  under the right/wrong standard.
Our statutory construction is guided by the following
well established principles:
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is
to be obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself.  And we must read statutoryNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning
of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their
true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to
extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent. One
 avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning.
 
Lingle v. Hawai' i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, 107 
Hawai'i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (internal quotation 
marks, brackets and ellipses omitted) (quoting Guth v. Freeland, 
96 Hawai' i 147, 149-50, 28 P.3d 982, 984-85 (2001)). 
The general principles of construction which apply to 
statutes also apply to administrative rules. Citizens Against 
Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Honolulu, 114 Hawai' i 
184, 194, 159 P.3d 143, 153 (2007). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
"The right to appeal is purely statutory and exists 
only when jurisdiction is given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 184, 111 P.3d at 
593. As a threshold matter, "every court must . . . determine 
. . . whether it has jurisdiction to decide the issue[s] 
presented." Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 
Hawai'i 64, 67, 881 P.2d 1210, 1213 (1994). Here, the question 
is whether the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to 
hear this case pursuant to HRS § 91-14 (2012 Repl.), the statute 
that provides for judicial review of a contested case. To invoke 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the circuit court's jurisdiction under HRS § 91-14, the appellant
 
must meet four requirements:
 
first, the proceeding that resulted in the unfavorable
agency action must have been a "contested case"
hearing -- i.e., a hearing that was (1) required by
law and (2) determined the "rights, duties, and
privileges of specific parties"; second, the agency's
action must represent "a final decision and order," or
"a preliminary ruling" such that deferral of review
would deprive the claimant of adequate relief; third,
the claimant must have followed the applicable agency
rules and, therefore, have been involved "in" the
contested case; and finally, the claimant's legal
interests must have been injured -- i.e., the claimant
must have standing to appeal.
 
PASH [Public Access Shoreline Hawai� i v. Hawai� i County 
Planning Comm'n], 79 Hawai' i [425,] 431, 903 P.2d [1246,]
1252 [(1995)] (bold emphases added). 
Kaleikini v. Thielen, 124 Hawai' i 1, 16-17, 237 P.3d 1067, 
1082-83 (2010) (brackets omitted). Because Wille does not meet 
the first criteria - that the agency action stemmed from a 
contested case hearing required by law - we look no further and 
conclude the circuit court did not err when it dismissed the case 
for lack of jurisdiction. 
"In order for an agency hearing to be 'required by 
law,' it may be required by (1) agency rule, (2) statute, or (3) 
constitutional due process." Aha Hui Malama O Kaniakapupu v. 
Land Use Comm'n, 111 Hawai' i 124, 132, 139 P.3d 712, 720 (2006). 
"If the statute or rule governing the activity in question does 
not mandate a hearing prior to the administrative agency's 
decision-making, the actions of the administrative agency are not 
'required by law' and do not amount to 'a final decision or order 
in a contested case' from which a direct appeal to circuit court 
is possible." Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai' i 128, 
134, 870 P.2d 1272, 1278 (1994). "[D]iscretionary hearings are not contested cases because they are not mandated by law." 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 184, 111 P.3d at 593. 
We conclude there is no statutory or rule-based
 
requirement for the BLNR to hold a hearing on the extension of
 
Parker Ranch's Leases. None of the HRS Chapter 171 provisions on
 
pasture leases contain any requirement for a hearing before BLNR
 
action on a lease or lease extension. See HRS §§ 171-14, 171-15,
 
171-16, 171-36 (2011 Repl.). Moreover, nothing in the remainder
 of HRS Chapter 171 or in the DLNR administrative rules (contained
 
in HAR Title 13) mandate a hearing on pasture leases. In
 
2 3
contrast, several sections of HRS Chapter 171 and HAR Title 13
specifically require a public hearing before the agency takes 
certain actions. The inclusion of particular language requiring 
a hearing only in specific sections of HRS Chapter 171 and in HAR 
Title 13 signifies that the requirement for a hearing was 
intentionally excluded from all other sections. See In re Water 
Use Permit Applications
, 94 Hawai' i 97, 151, 9 P.3d 409, 463 
(2000) (stating "[w]here [the legislature] includes particular 
language in one section of a statute but omits it in another 
section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that [the 
legislature] acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate 
inclusion or exclusion"). 
Wille contends HRS § 171-26 requires the BLNR to hold
 
2 E.g., HRS §§ 171-28 (requiring the BLNR conduct a public hearing
 
when leasing government-owned Hawaiian fishponds without legislative
authorization); 171-58 (requiring a hearing before leasing water rights); 171-80
(before cancelling a residential leasehold); 171-41, 171-41.5 (before amending
height, density, or use restrictions imposed in certain leases); and 171-95.3
(before entering or renewing any lease of public land to renewable energy
producers) (2011 Repl.). 
E.g., HAR §§ 13-184-8 (requiring the BLNR hold public hearings
 
before acting on a proposal to designate an area as a geothermal resource
subzone); 13-184-11(1) (before determining whether to issue a conservation
district use permit); 13-5-40 (before granting a permit, site approval, or
management plan approval in a conservation district); 13-183-26 (requiring a
hearing on revocations of a mining lease).
 
7
 3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a contested case hearing before granting a lease extension. 
Although HRS § 171-26 requires the BLNR to lay out "a reasonable
 
number of rights-of-way" before disposing of public lands,
 
nothing in the section requires a hearing in connection with this
 
process.4
 
Wille also contends she is entitled to a contested case
 
hearing because she is an interested person pursuant to HAR § 13­
1-31 ("Parties").5 However, the rule sets forth who may have
 
4 HRS § 171-26 states in full:
 
§171-26 Rights-of-way to the sea, game management areas, and
public hunting areas. Prior to the disposition of any public lands, the
board of land and natural resources shall lay out and establish over and
across such lands a reasonable number of rights-of-way from established
highways to the public beaches, game management areas, public hunting
areas, and public forests and forest reserves in order that the right of
the people to utilize the public beaches, game management areas, public
hunting areas, and public forests and forest reserves shall be
protected.
 
Prior to the leasing of any lands, the board shall determine
the feasibility of hunting on such lands, and if any of them is
suitable for hunting or may during the term of the lease become
suitable for hunting, the board may reserve such lands as game
management areas or public hunting areas. Where the board finds
that hunting on such lands would not be consistent with the rights
of the lessee or for other good cause, the board need not reserve
such lands as game management areas or public hunting areas.
 
The cost of such rights-of-way and any fencing which may be
required shall be borne by the State, lessee or jointly as the
board may deem appropriate prior to the leasing of such lands.
 
5 Specifically, Wille relies on HAR § 13-1-31(b) and (h), which
state:
 
§13-1-31 Parties.
 
. . . .
 
(b) The following persons or agencies shall be admitted as
parties: 
(1) All government agencies whose jurisdiction
includes the land in question shall be admittedas parties upon timely application. 
(2) 
All persons who have some property interest in
(continued...) 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
standing only after it is determined that a contested case is
 
required. HAR § 13-1-31 does not itself contain a mandate for a
 
contested case hearing. A preceding section, HAR § 13-1-28
 
("Contested Cases") sets forth the requirement for holding
 
contested cases and states: "When required by law, the [BLNR]
 
shall hold a contested case hearing upon its own motion or on a
 
written petition of any government agency or any interested
 
person." HAR § 13-1-28(a) (emphasis added). Thus, when read
 
together HAR §§ 13-1-28 and 13-1-31 allow certain persons or
 
agencies to be parties in a contested case, but only when an
 
independent law requires the agency to hold a contested case
 
hearing. 
Without a statute or rule requiring the BLNR to hold a 
contested case hearing before extending the Leases, the remaining 
question is whether constitutional due process requires a 
contested case hearing. Bush, 76 Hawai' i at 135, 870 P.2d at 
1279. To establish a due process right to a contested case hearing, the claimant must first show that "the particular 
interest which claimant seeks to protect by a hearing [is] 
'property' within the meaning of the due process clauses of the 
federal and state constitutions[.]" Sandy Beach Def. Fund v. 
City Council of Honolulu, 70 Haw. 361, 376, 773 P.2d 250, 260 
5(...continued)
 
the land, who lawfully reside on the land, who are
adjacent property owners, or who otherwise can
demonstrate that they will be so directly and
immediately affected by the requested action that
their interest in the proceeding is clearly
distinguishable from that of the general public shall
be admitted as parties upon timely application.
 
. . . . 
(h)
 A person whose request to be admitted as a party
has been denied by the board may appeal that denial to the circuit
court pursuant to section 91-14, HRS.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1989).
 
The property interest must be one for which the 
claimant has "a legitimate claim of entitlement" and must be 
"more than an abstract need or desire" or "a unilateral 
expectation." Bush, 76 Hawai' i at 136, 870 P.2d at 1280. Wille 
asserts that she has a cognizable property interest on three grounds: (1) her ownership of property adjoining the land under 
the Leases, (2) her "recreational-health and aesthetic 
interests," and (3) her status as a beneficiary of the public 
trust under article XII, section 4 of the Hawai' i State 
Constitution.
6 We conclude none of her stated interests rise to 
the level of a property interest entitled to due process 
protection. 
First, Wille's assertion that Town v. Land Use Comm'n,
 
55 Haw. 538, 524 P.2d 84 (1974) recognizes a protected property
 
interest in adjacent property owners is incorrect. In Town, the
 
adjoining property owner's entitlement to a contested case
 
hearing was mandated by a specific statute, not by constitutional
 
due process. See Id., 55 Haw. at 542 n.2, 548 n.4, 524 P.2d at
 
87 n.2, 91 n.4 (quoting the versions of HRS §§ 205-3 and 205-4 in
 effect at the time, requiring "public hearings" in conjunction
 
with the adoption or amendment of district boundaries by the Land
 
Use Commission). 
Second, "[w]hile we have recognized the importance of 
6
 Article XII, section 4 states: 
Section 4.  The lands granted to the State of Hawai' i 
by Section 5(b) of the Admission Act and pursuant to article
XVI, section 7, of the State Constitution, excludingtherefrom lands defined as "available lands" by Section 203of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended,shall be held by the State as a public trust for nativeHawaiians and the general public. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
aesthetic and environmental interests in determining an 
individual's standing to contest the issue, we have not found 
that such interests rise to the level of 'property' within the 
meaning of the due process clause[.]" Sandy Beach Def. Fund, 70 
Haw. at 377, 773 P.2d at 261 (citation omitted). Wille's reliance on In re ' Iao Ground Water Mgmt. Area High-Level Source 
Water Use Permit Applications, 128 Hawai' i 228, 241, 287 P.3d 
129, 142, is unavailing. In that case, the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
concluded the native Hawaiian claimants' interests in traditional and customary rights had a statutory basis in the water code. In 
re 'Iao, 128 Hawai' i at 241-42, 287 P.3d at 142-43 (citing 
HRS §§ 174C-101, 174C-63 (1993)). Wille has not cited any 
statutory basis supporting her entitlement to recreational and 
aesthetic interests. 
Finally, our courts have never held that an 
individual's status as the beneficiary of the "public trust" 
constitutes a cognizable property interest warranting due process 
protection. See Keahole Def. Coal., Inc. v. Bd. of Land & 
Natural Res., 110 Hawai' i 419, 434, 134 P.3d 585, 600 (2006) 
("The plain language of [article XII, section 4 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution] does not directly support [the claimant's] contention that it is deprived of a property right and [the 
claimant] has not directed this court to any case law or 
statutory authority to support its interpretation[.]"). 
Without a statutory, rule-based, or constitutional 
mandate for a contested case hearing, the BLNR hearings that took 
place on February 11, 2011 and February 25, 2011 did not 
constitute a "contested case" for the purposes of obtaining 
appellate review pursuant to HRS § 91–14(a). Bush, 76 Hawai' i at 
136, 870 P.2d at 1280. Furthermore, if no right to a contested case exists, judicial review of an agency's denial of a request 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for a contested case hearing "is unattainable due to lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction." Id. at 136, 870 P.2d at 1280
 
(concluding no subject matter jurisdiction existed to review the
 denial of a request for a contested case hearing when an agency
 
hearing was held, but the hearing was not required by law). 
Lastly, we address Wille's contention that the circuit 
court had jurisdiction pursuant to article XII, section 4 of the 
Hawai'i Constitution. Assuming arguendo that article XII, 
section 4 creates an original cause of action that can function as a means of invoking judicial review, we conclude Wille's 
pleadings in the circuit court failed to invoke the circuit 
court's original jurisdiction. Wille filed her action as an 
agency appeal, and she did not contest the BLNR's actions through 
any means other than her request for a contested case hearing and 
her subsequent appeal. Although Wille cited article XII, section 
4 in her notice of appeal and included a request for injunctive 
relief in her supporting statement of the case, this isolated 
language, without more, is insufficient to assert an independent 
constitutional right to judicial review as a basis for 
jurisdiction. 
Therefore, we conclude Wille asserted only HRS § 91-14
 
as her basis for judicial review, and as Wille had no right to a
 
contested case hearing, the circuit court did not err when it
 
dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.
