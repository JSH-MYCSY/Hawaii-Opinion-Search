 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wolf argues that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing
 
his complaint and denying his motion for summary judgment because
 
(1) Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 338-18 does not bar access to 
an individual's birth records when that individual waives his or 
her right to confidentiality; (2) the Hawai' i Uniform Information 
Practices Act (UIPA) (Modified), HRS § 92F, provides for access by Wolf to the requested records based on the statute's rules of 
construction and purpose; and (3) the federal constitution 
prohibits any state law or state action which denies or obstructs 
access to a current president's birth records. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Wolf's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) As acknowledged by Wolf, the plain text of HRS 
§ 338-18 (2010 and Supp. 2012) prohibits the DOH from disclosing 
President Obama's birth records to Wolf because he does not fit 
into any of the provision's enumerated categories. The statute 
sets forth a general rule that vital statistics records may not 
be disclosed except to individuals who have a direct and tangible 
interest in the records. HRS § 338-18; Justice v. Fuddy, 125 
Hawai'i 104, 109, 253 P.3d 665, 670 (App. 2011); see also Haw. 
Op. Att'y Gen. OIP Opinion Letter No. 90-23, 1990 WL 482371, at *2 (June 28, 1990). It then affirmatively grants the right of 
access to certain categories of individuals who, by their status, 
are considered to have direct and tangible interest in the 
documents. HRS § 338-18. These provisions do not discuss any 
right or privilege that the registrant can "waive" such that the 
general public becomes entitled to access the registrant's 
records. Rather, they create an affirmative right of access in 
certain categories of individuals. Thus, a waiver of the 
registrant's right created by the statute would merely relinquish 
the registrant's own right of access to the record. Therefore, 
President Obama's public disclosure of his birth records does 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nothing to loosen the strictures of the statute. Accordingly,
 
the court rejects Wolf's argument that HRS § 338-18 does not
 
apply to bar his access to the requested birth records.
 
(2) Wolf's argument that HRS § 92F-2(5) (2012)
 
overrides HRS § 92F-13(4) (2012) lacks persuasive power because
 
he cites no authorities in support of his implicit contention
 
that a statute's purpose or rule of construction can negate the
 
explicit terms of the statute. To the contrary, courts have
 
rejected such arguments. See, e.g., Matter of Estate of Allen,
 
388 N.W.2d 705, 707 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986) (rejecting party's
 contention that a statutory rule of construction negated an
 
express provision of the state probate code that explicitly
 
authorized a transfer challenged by the party). Further weighing
 
against Wolf's interpretation, rules of construction are designed
 
to resolve questions of ambiguity, not create them. See U.S. v.
 
Rice, 327 U.S. 742, 752-53 (1946). To the extent that there is a
 conflict between HRS § 92F-2(5) and HRS § 92F-13(4), a well-
accepted principle of statutory construction favors the specific
 
statute (here, HRS § 92F-13(4), which provides a clear, detailed
 
rule) over the general (HRS § 92F-2(5), which sets forth a more
 
amorphous balancing test). See Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 Haw. 349, 356,
 
742 P.2d 359, 366 (1987).
 
(3) The court has a duty to determine whether Wolf has 
standing to bring his purported constitutional claim because, if Wolf lacks standing, he may not invoke the court's jurisdiction. 
See Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of Hawai' i Supreme Court, 91 
Hawai'i 51, 55, 979 P.2d 1077, 1081 (1999). Here, Wolf cannot 
show that he has suffered a distinct and palpable injury because 
he merely alleges a harm to his interest in the proper 
application of the Constitution and laws, which is a general 
interest common to all members of the public, and he seeks relief 
that no more directly and tangibly benefits himself than it does 
the public at large. See Berg v. Obama, 574 F.Supp.2d 509, 517 
(E.D. Pa. 2008). Further supporting this determination, numerous
 courts have concluded that private citizens lack standing to
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
bring claims based on the presidential eligibility clause of the
 
federal constitution where there is no showing of particularized
 
harm. See, e.g., id. at 517-21; Sibley v. Obama, 866 F.Supp.2d
 
17, 20 (D.D.C. 2012); Hollander v. McCain, 566 F.Supp.2d 63, 71
 (D.N.H. 2008); cf. Barnett v. Obama, No. SACV 09–0082, 2009 WL
 
3861788, at *8-10 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2009) (differentiating
 
between competing candidates for the presidency and members of
 
the general public as regards whether the types of plaintiffs had
 
standing to bring a claim under the presidential eligibility
 
clause). Given Wolf's failure to demonstrate that he has
 
suffered a particularized injury related to his lack of access to
 
President Obama's birth records, he lacks standing to bring such
 
a claim.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's "Final Judgment as to All Claims and All Parties"
 entered on April 25, 2012; the April 25, 2012 "Order Denying
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed on December 20,
 
2011;" and the January 27, 2012 "Order Granting Motion to Dismiss
 
Complaint to Compel Agency to Disclose Public Records Under the
 
Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA), Filed on September 30,
 
2011" are affirmed.
