SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
This case addresses the claim made by Plaintiff-
Appellant Duncan Sunahara ("Sunahara") that he was entitled to a
 
"certified copy of the original hospital-generated paper
 Certificate of Live Birth" (Birth Certificate") for his deceased
 sister, Virginia Sunahara ("Virginia"). Sunahara appeals from
 the Final Judgment as to All Claims and All Parties, filed
 April 20, 2012 ("Judgment"), entered in favor of Defendants-
Appellees Department of Health, State of Hawai
'i and Linda M. 
Rosen in her official capacity as Director of the Department of

 During the pendency of this appeal, Linda M. Rosen was appointed
as Director, Department of Health, State of Hawai' i, and has been substituted
as a party to this appeal pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
Rule 43(c) (2010).   
  
   
  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").2
 
On appeal, Sunahara alleges that: (1) the Circuit Court
 
erred in granting summary judgment in favor of DOH because
 
Sunahara is entitled to a certified copy of Virginia's original
 Birth Certificate, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
 
3 4
§§ 338-13(a)  and 92F-11 ; (2) the Circuit Court's interpretation
of HRS § 338-13(a) and Chapter 8B was erroneous; and (3) the

 
Circuit Court erred in denying Sunahara the right to inspect and
 obtain the Birth Certificate pursuant to Chapter 92F.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to

 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment and address Sunahara's points as follows:
 
(1) Sunahara alleges that DOH did not comply with HRS
 
§ 338-13(a) when it issued the Abstract. 
§ 338-13 Certified copies. (a) Subject to the

requirements of sections 338-16, 338-17, and 338-18,[ 5] the
department of health shall, upon request, furnish to any

applicant a certified copy of any certificate, or the
 
contents of any certificate, or any part thereof.
 
(b) Copies of the contents of any certificate on file

in the department, certified by the department shall be
considered for all purposes the same as the original,
subject to the requirements of sections 338-16, 338-17 and
338-18.
 
(c) Copies may be made by photography, dry copy
reproduction, typing, computer printout or other process
approved by the director of health.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 338-13 (2010) (emphases added).
 
Sunahara first contends that, under the plain meaning
 
of the statute, he was entitled to a "certified copy of any
 
certificate." H AW. REV. STAT. § 338-13(a). Not unreasonably, he

 "Subject to the requirements of sections 338-16, 338-17, and 338­
18, the department of health shall, upon request, furnish to any applicant a
certified copy of any certificate, or the contents of any certificate, or any
part thereof." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 338-13(a) (2010).

 "All government records are open to public inspection unless
access is restricted or closed by law." H AW. REV. STAT. § 92F-11(a).
 
5/
 HRS § 338-18(b) states that to inspect a record, a person must
have a "direct and tangible interest in the record." Sunahara has a "direct
 and tangible interest" because he has a "common ancestor" with Virginia. H
AW.
 
REV. STAT. § 338-18(b)(5) (2010).

reads the words "any certificate" to include the Birth
 
Certificate. HRS § 338-13 also states that DOH "shall" take
 action upon request, and thus it is mandatory that DOH respond to
 an applicant's proper request for a certificate. Id. (emphasis
 
added). 
Sunahara's "plain language" argument fails, however,
 
because HRS § 338-13(a) affords DOH three alternate ways to
 satisfy its obligation to provide a certified copy. DOH must
 furnish to any applicant "[(1)] a certified copy of any
 certificate, or [(2)] the contents of any certificate, or [(3)]
 any part thereof." Id. Each of the options is separated by the
 
word "or". Id.
 
The common usage of "or" is "disjunctive, indicating an 
alternative" and it "usually connects words or phrases of different meanings permitting a choice of either." State v. 
Kalani, 108 Hawai
'i 279, 284, 118 P.3d 1222, 1227 (2005) (quoting 
State v. Sorenson, 44 Hawai 'i 601, 604, 359 P.2d 289, 291 (1961) 
(internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, under the plain language of HRS § 338-13, Sunahara is not entitled to a "certified copy of any certificate[.]" Instead, his request may be satisfied by one of multiple means, including an abstract of the contents of any certificate. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 338-13(a). 
Sunahara argues that the disjunctive "or" in HRS § 338­
13(a) should be read as "and" because "[e]ach of the terms 'or' and 'and', has the meaning of the other or of both." H
AW. REV. 
STAT. § 1-18 (2009). However, in addressing HRS § 1-18, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has explained that "[t]he sense of a word 
[(disjunctive or conjunctive)] which harmonizes best with the whole context of the statute and promotes in the fullest manner the apparent policy and objects of the legislature must be adopted." In re City & Cnty. of Honolulu Corp. Counsel, 54 Haw. 
356, 374, 507 P.2d 169, 178 (1973) (citing Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital v. Cnty. of Kauai, 46 Haw. 260, 377 P.2d 703 (1962)). In this case, the legislative history of HRS § 338­13(a) indicates that the legislature added options to HRS § 338­13(a) in order to allow DOH increased flexibility to save time and money. See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 10, in 1978 House Journal, 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 1260; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 21-78, in 1978 Senate Journal, at
 
758. Thus, Sunahara's interpretation of "or" as meaning "and",
 
which would require DOH to provide him with all three types of
 documents listed in HRS § 338-13(a), is inconsistent with the
 legislative objectives, and is therefore not an appropriate
 construction of the statute.
 
The statute does not explain, however, who is to 
determine which of the three alternative documents is to be provided. To that extent, the statute is ambiguous. Riethbrock, 
128 Hawai
'i at 11, 282 P.3d at 553. When a statute is ambiguous, 
"a court's 'primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intention.'" Neumann v. Ramil, 6 Haw. App. 377, 383­
84, 722 P.2d 1048, 1053 (1986) (quoting Puchert v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 25, 34, 677 P.2d 449, 456 (1984)). 
In 1978, the legislature amended HRS § 338-13(a) to
 
include the phrase, "or the contents of any certificate." 1978
 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 49, § 1 at 62. The Conference Committee
 Report stated that the "purpose of this bill is to enable the
 Department of Health to issue certified copies of vital records
 by whatever system appears simplest and least expensive in cost
 and clerical time." Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 10, in 1978 House
 Journal, at 1260; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 21-78, in 1978 Senate
 Journal, at 758 (emphasis added). In addition, the House
 Standing Committee Report stated that the amended statute "would
 allow the department enough flexibility to overcome the increased
 demands for information in this area." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 664-78, in 1978 House Journal, at 1696 (emphasis added).
 
Thus, it appears that the legislature intended, in
 
adding the phrase "or the contents of any certificate," to allow
 DOH to save time and money by providing more flexibility over
 which type of document to issue. As such, the "or" in HRS § 338­13(a) must be read to allow DOH discretion to choose from among
 the three options to satisfy the request. For purposes of
 summary judgment, therefore, DOH satisfied its burden in showing
 that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact regarding
 Sunahara's alleged entitlement to a certified copy of the Birth
 Certificate under HRS chapter 338.

(2) Sunahara argues that Chapter 8B § 2.5(A) requires
 
DOH to provide him with a certified copy of the Birth
 
Certificate. He further argues that Chapter 8B §§ 2.1(C) and
 2.1(G), read together, require DOH to provide him with physical
 access to the Birth Certificate to permit verification.
6
 
Chapter 8B was adopted pursuant to DOH's authority
 
under HRS § 338-2(3).7 HAW. REV. STAT. § 338-2(3) (2010). Several
 
provisions within Chapter 8B relate to the process by which DOH
 issues copies of birth certificates. 
Focusing first on subsection 2.5(A) of Chapter 8B,
 
entitled "Eligibility for Copies of Birth Certificates," Sunahara
 maintains that this section entitles him to access Virginia's
 Birth Certificate because it uses the phrase "certified copy of
 the original birth certificate." Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117-8B­2.5(A). On the other hand, DOH contends that subsection 2.5(B),
 when read in conjunction with subsection 2.5(A), gives DOH
 discretion to either provide a standard "certified copy of the
 
6/
 Chapter 8B § 2.1(C) and (G) provide as follows:
 
C.	 Individuals
 
Upon written request and proper identification, the
state registrar or local registrar of a registration
district (county) may permit an individual to examine
a certificate for the purpose of verifying an entry or
correcting an error; provided that the individual is
eligible to receive such information as described in
Paragraphs 2.5 through 2.9 herein.
 
. . .
 
G.	 Limitations
 
Except as provided in section 2.1, all persons granted
access to the vital records shall be afforded access
 under the supervision of a person authorized by the
Director of Health.
 
Haw. Admin. R. §§ 11-117-8B-2.1(C), -2.1(G).
 
7/
 HRS § 338-2(3) provides that DOH shall "[m]ake and amend, after
notice and hearing, necessary regulations, give instructions and prescribe
forms for collecting, transcribing, compiling, and preserving public health
statistics[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 338-2(3) (2010).

original birth certificate",  or an "[a]bbreviated copy",  as DOH
has provided. 
We begin by observing that Chapter 8B § 2.5 does not

 
address the form that a copy or excerpt of a birth certificate
 
must take. Instead, the section describes who may receive a copy
 or abstract. Chapter 8B §2.5 (A) states that "[a] certified copy
 of the original birth certificate on file . . . may be issued
 to[,]" and then lists a number of types of people who are
 authorized to receive a certified copy. Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117­8B-2.5(A)
. Similarly, Chapter 8B § 2.5(B) provides that "(1) [a]
 
certified copy may be issued to any person authorized to receive
 a standard certified copy"; and that "(2) [a] non-certified copy
 containing only such information as is listed in accordance with
 Section 2.2 may be issued to any person or organization
 requesting it." Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117-8B-2.5(B) (emphases
 added). While these regulations appear to contemplate the
 existence of both "standard" and "abbreviated" copies of birth
 certificates, the focus of the section is on who is authorized to
 receive those records, rather than the form that such records may
 take. Accordingly, Chapter 8B § 2.5 has no bearing on our
 analysis of this point.
 
Sunahara also argues that Chapter 8B § 2.1(C) and (G)
 
entitle him to inspect Virginia's Birth Certificate. Neither of
 these subsections, however, requires DOH to give Sunahara a
 certified copy or allow him to inspect the Birth Certificate. 
Subsection 2.1(C) states that "[u]pon written request
 
and proper identification, the state registrar or local registrar
 of a registration district (county) may permit an individual to
 examine a certificate for the purpose of verifying an entry or
 correcting an error . . . ." Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117-8B-2.1(C)
 (emphases added). First, subsection 2.1(C) uses the word "may"
 when describing the procedure permitting an individual to examine
 
8/
 "Standard copies of vital records may be prepared by photographic,
dry copy reproduction process or by typing." Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117-8B­
2.4(B)(1)(a).
 
9/
 "Abbreviated copies may be prepared by typing, computer printout,
or by any other process approved by the Director." Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117­8B-2.4(B)(2)(a).

a certificate. Therefore, the examination of birth records is on 
a discretionary basis only. State v. Kahawai, 103 Hawai 'i 462, 
465, 83 P.3d 725, 728 (2004) (quoting State ex rel. City of Niles v. Bernard, 372 N.E.2d 339, 341 (Ohio 1978)). Second, nowhere in
 the Complaint did Sunahara allege that he plans to "verify[] an
 entry or correct[] an error" in Virginia's Birth Certificate, as
 required to gain access pursuant to Chapter 8B § 2.1(C). Id.
 
Moreover, subsection 2.1(G) does not affirmatively
 
provide for access to records, but instead is titled
 "limitations" and imposes restrictions on those who are granted
 access to vital records. Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117-8B-2.1(G). It
 states that "[e]xcept as provided in section 2.1, all persons
 granted access to the vital records shall be afforded access
 under the supervision of a person authorized by the Director of
 Health." Id. (emphasis added). Inasmuch as subsection 2.1(G)
 
refers to an individual that has already been "granted access",
 it does not establish access. Id.
 
Accordingly, DOH did not violate Chapter 8B when it
 
issued the Abstract rather than the Birth Certificate. Further,
 nothing in Chapter 8B guarantees Sunahara access to the original
 Birth Certificate, or the ability to be present while it is
 copied. Therefore, summary judgment was properly granted on
 Sunahara's Chapter 8B claims.
 
(3) Sunahara contends that Chapter 92F provides a
 
separate basis entitling him to access, inspect, and obtain a
 certified copy of the Birth Certificate as a "government record." 
Under Chapter 92F, government records must be disclosed except
 where (1) access is restricted or closed by law, or (2) one of
 the enumerated exceptions in HRS § 92F-13 applies. H
AW. REV.
 
STAT. § 92F-11.
 
Chapter 8B restricts access to vital records. 
Vital records authorized under Chapter 338, Hawaii Revised
Statutes, are not available for or open to public
inspection. Access to the records, including copies or
information from them, is not permitted except as provided
by law or regulations the Department of Health may
promulgate.
 
Haw. Admin. R. § 11-117-8B-2.1(A). HRS chapter 338, as noted
 
above, permits access, but authorizes the DOH to restrict access
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
to only the contents of a certificate. Therefore, Sunahara is
 
not entitled to any further access under Chapter 92F-11, and the
 Circuit Court did not err in granting summary judgment on that
 claim.
