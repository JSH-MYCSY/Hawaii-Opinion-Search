On appeal, Pa'a contends that the District Court lacked
 
subject matter jurisdiction over his case because he has
 
demonstrated the continuing existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom. 
Our appellate courts, however, have repeatedly held that claims
 of this nature are without merit. In State v. Kaulia, 128
 Hawai
'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013), the Hawai'i Supreme 
Court reaffirmed this view where it stated:
 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from
the court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of
the Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm
that "[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness"
of its origins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now, a
lawful government." State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 
43, 55. 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004),
 aff'd, 106
Hawai'i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). Individuals claiming
to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are
not exempt from application of the State's laws. See
 
id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77
Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State v.
French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182
(App. 1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d
444 (1999).
 
(Ellipsis points and brackets in original).
 
Accordingly, the April 30, 2012, Judgment for
 
Possession entered by the District Court is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 30, 2013.
