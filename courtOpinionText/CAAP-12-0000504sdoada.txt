IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MARTEZ V. GRIFFIN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 11-1-2255)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Martez V. Griffin (Griffin) appeals
 
from the "Judgment Of Conviction And Sentence; Notice of Entry"
 
entered January 12, 2012, in the Family Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (family court).  Following a jury-waived trial, the
 
family court convicted Griffin of one count of Abuse of Family or
 
Household Members, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 709­
906(1) (Supp. 2012) and sentenced Griffin to two days of
 
imprisonment and two years of probation. 
On appeal, Griffin contends the family court erred
 
when it: 
(1)
 admitted hearsay testimony under the excited
 
utterance and/or present sense impression exceptions; and

(2) convicted Griffin with insufficient evidence to
 
show Griffin caused visible bodily injury to the Complaining
 
Witness (CW).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Griffin's appeal is without merit. 
(1) Griffin contends the family court erred when it
 
allowed, under the excited utterance and/or present sense
 
impression exceptions and over his objections, two police
 
officers to testify about statements made by CW.
 
Assuming arguendo the family court erred in admitting 
CW's statements under the excited utterance and/or present sense impression exceptions, such error was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt in light of the substantial evidence in the 
record to support Griffin's conviction. Two eyewitnesses 
testified to having seen Griffin pull or drag CW by the hair and 
arm before forcefully shoving CW into the side of a parked truck. 
CW's statements to the police officers were similar to the 
testimony offered by the two eyewitnesses. An erroneously 
admitted statement is a harmless error where the statements are 
cumulative of other properly admitted evidence. State v. 
Crisostomo, 94 Hawai' i 282, 290, 12 P.3d 873, 881 (2000). Any 
error in admitting CW's statements to the police officers was 
harmless since these statements were cumulative of the testimony 
of the two eyewitnesses. 
(2) Griffin contends that without the hearsay 
testimony, the State of Hawai' i provided insufficient evidence to 
prove Griffin caused any visible bodily injury to CW. Sufficient evidence to support a conviction is "credible evidence which is 
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion[.]" State v. Fields, 
115 Hawai' i 503, 530, 168 P.3d 955, 982 (2007) (citing State v. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Martinez, 101 Hawai' i 332, 338-39, 68 P.3d 606, 612-13 (2003)). 
Evidence is considered in light most favorable to the 
prosecution, barring any erroneously admitted evidence which is 
excluded from review. Id. 
In this case, the second police officer testified that
 
he observed "redness and swelling" on the left side of CW's head. 
This testimony, in addition to the testimony of the two
 
eyewitnesses that stated Griffin pulled CW by the hair, was
 
sufficient to establish that Griffin's actions caused injury to
 
CW. Therefore, even excluding the hearsay testimony, there is
 
sufficient evidence to support Griffin's conviction.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment Of Conviction
 
And Sentence; Notice of Entry" entered January 12, 2012 in the
 Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
