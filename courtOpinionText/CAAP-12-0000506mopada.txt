BRADLEY JOHN ARGUE, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BONDU KONDEH ARGUE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 10-1-252K)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bondu Kondeh Argue (Bondu) appeals1
 
a April 23, 2012 Divorce Decree entered in the Family Court of
 
2
 the Third Circuit (family court), which denied her request for a
spousal support award from Plaintiff-Appellee Bradley John Argue
 
(Bradley).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Background of the Parties
 
On September 20, 1985, Bondu and Bradley were married
 
in Sierra Leone, Africa. Bradley is from Minnesota and went to
 Sierra Leone to work for the Peace Corps. Bondu was born and

 Bondu's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai� i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). "Generally, failure to comply with HRAP Rule
28(b)(4) is alone sufficient to affirm the trial court's judgment.
Nonetheless, this court observes a policy of affording pro se litigants the
opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible."Hawaiian Properties, Ltd. v. Tauala, 125 Hawai� i 176, 181, 254 P.3d 487, 492

raised in Sierra Leone and was self-employed from 1986-1988.
 
Bondu had a child by a previous marriage, Kumba "Betty" Argue
 (Betty), born October 27, 1985, whom Bradley legally adopted. 
The Argues had three biological children during the marriage. 
Scott Sahr Argue (Scott) was born on September 5, 1987; John
 Tamba Argue (John) was born on September 8, 1993; and a minor 
child (minor child) born August 10, 1995. Betty and Scott are
 adults and are not financially dependent on their parents. John
 is an adult who attends Penn State University and lives with
 Bondu. The minor child also lives with Bondu, who currently has
 legal and physical custody. Bradley is responsible for John and
 the minor child's college expenses.
 
In 1989, the Argues moved from Sierra Leone to Alabama,
 
where Bradley completed his college degree at Auburn University. 
Bradley financed his education with savings, student loans, and
 graduate assistant work. Bradley continued to attend school,
 graduating with a master's degree in December 1991 and a doctoral
 degree in 1996. Bondu asserts "she was the sole breadwinner,
 working three jobs to support the family while [Bradley] was
 going through college for his undergraduate and graduate and PhD
 in Alabama." In Alabama, Bondu worked in the fast food industry,
 did babysitting, yard work and house cleaning, and worked as a
 pond maintenance technician.
 
While Bradley attended school, the Argues "lived the 
life of a young financially struggling family trying to make ends meet." In 1998, Bradley found employment on O� ahu and the Argues 
relocated. The Argues continued to struggle financially due to Hawai�i's higher cost of living. In 2001, Bradley took a new job 
on Hawai� i island with Moana Technologies, LLC and commuted from 
O�ahu until 2005, when he moved to Hawai� i island permanently. 
Bondu and the children continued to live on O� ahu where Bondu 
engaged casual work as a babysitter, yard worker, and a caretaker for the elderly and sick people. 
In August 2006, Bondu moved to Pennsylvania where she
 
worked as a caretaker for Vision Health Care until 2011. She
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
continues to live there with the minor child and John. Bradley
 
visited Bondu and his children 1-2 times a year through 2008.
 
At the time that the parties' case went to trial, the
 
net marital estate was worth (-)$37,255, of which Bradley assumed
 (-)$31,717 of the debt and Bondu assumed (-)$5,538. Bondu was 47
 years old and Bradley was 53 years old.
 
In November 2010, Bradley left his position as a
 
research scientist with Moana Technologies, LLC in Kona and
 entered a three-year employment contract with the National Prawn
 Company in Saudi Arabia. Over the course of the proceedings,
 Bradley's reported monthly gross pay increased from $8,000 per
 month in his October 13, 2010 Income and Expense statement to
 $8,533 in his May 19, 2011 Income and Expense statement.
 
Bondu's Income and Expense statement dated June 28,
 
2011 shows a negative balance of (-)$3,361. She asserts that she
 currently has no income and finances her living expenses from
 child support payments and charity from friends. Bradley has
 paid Bondu $1,590 a month for John's and the minor child's living
 expenses since January 2010;
3
 and two friends, one of whom is a
friend of Bradley's and to whom Bondu refers to as a "brother,"
 help her financially. Bondu alleges that Vision Health Care
 discontinued her employment in January 2011 because her
 illiteracy precluded her from obtaining a license required of
 careworkers. 
Bondu claims she is unemployed and is seeking
 
vocational rehabilitation services from the State of
 Pennsylvania.
 
Bondu was first diagnosed with chronic back problems in 
Hawai�i and has had at least three major incidents where 
emergency assistance was required to get her out of bed. At the February 24, 2012 hearing, Bondu testified to the family court that her "back gets stuck" and she left her home on a stretcher a "few times." Bradley observed that Bondu "would throw out her back at times," received muscle relaxant medical treatment for

 On July 5, 2011, the family court ordered Bradley to continue paying
$1,590 per month in child support to Bondu for the minor child and John.

that condition, and "at times [her back pain] was a problem [in
 
'taking care of her activities, the daily living or her work,']
 if she had to turn someone over or something." Bondu will not be
 able to afford medical coverage, which costs on average $400-$500
 a month.
 
B. Procedural History
 
On October 12, 2010, Bradley filed a complaint for
 
divorce.
4 On February 3, 2011, Bondu filed her answer. The
 
family court entered a divorce decree on April 23, 2012.
 
The parties entered a stipulation agreement, filed on
 
February 24, 2012, reserving for trial issues relating to
 "[a]limony, an Equalization Payment on division and distribution
 of assets and debts, and Attorney fees . . . ."
5 Also on that
 
day, trial was held to resolve spousal support, equalization
 payment issues, and other property disputes.
6 On March 20,
 
2012, the family court entered its Findings of Fact (FOFs),
 Conclusions of Law (COLs), and Order (FOF/COL/Order).
 
The FOF/COL/Order made the following relevant findings:
 
4 The parties discussed whether Bradley's employment outside Hawai� i in 
the six months prior to filing for a divorce raises a jurisdictional issues at
a September 21, 2011 hearing. His 2010 Hawai� i tax return, resolving
questions about his domicile, was received into evidence on February 24, 2012. 
5 Child custody and support issues were resolved in the following ways:
(1) Bradley pays for John's college expenses, averaging $1,218 per month; (2)
Bondu was awarded legal and physical custody of the minor child, and Bradley
was awarded reasonable visitation and travel rights with respect to the minor
child; (3) Bradley was made responsible for financing John and the minor
child's college education and related expenses.
6 The parties' property and debt responsibilities were divided in the
following ways: (1) Bradley is responsible for debts in his name and a
Discover card debt of $3,693 and an IRS debt of $4,200; (2) Bondu is awarded
the 2007 Honda Odyssey and is responsible for debts of approximately $10,000
on that vehicle and all debts in her name; (3) Parties retain personal
properties in their possession and bank accounts in their own names; and (4)
Bradley retains a $6,000 IRA account.
 
The parties stipulation agreement reserved equalization payment
issues for trial. The family court concluded that Bondu would owe Bradley
$13,089.50 "as an equalization payment under Hawaii's Marital Partnership
Model absent valid and relevant consideration exist [sic] for equitable
deviation." Bradley did not seek an order awarding him an equalization
payment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
68. [Bondu] has a back condition that she said
started while the partes lived in Alabama.
 
69. [Bradley] acknowledged that he knew [Bondu's]
back would give her problems when it would fair [sic] up
occassionally [sic], and that she had been prescribed muscle
relaxants.
 
70. Despite her back condition, [Bondu] continued to
work as a caretaker on Oahu and in Pennsylvania up until
2011. [Bondu] claims she was laid off from her last job not
because of her back or any medically related issue, but
because she was not licensed as a [caretaker].
 
71. No evidence was offered concerning what treatment
or accommodations, if any, [Bondu] requires for her back
condition, nor how it effects her now versus in previous
years.
 
72. [Bondu] claims to be functionally illiterate with a
limited ability to read and write in the English language.
 
73. [Bondu] did not speak English when she and [Bradley]
first met.
 
74. No evidence of what services, if any, that [Bondu]
needs to address her illiteracy, or need for education, was
submitted. [Bondu's] current unemployment is unrelated to
illiteracy.
. . . .
 
80. [Bradley] took the job in Saudi Arabia to help pay
for John's and [the minor child's] college education, and he
has stipulated to be solely responsible to financially
assist them. Paragraph 12 of the February 24, 2012
stipulation and order.
 
81. [Bondu] claims she is now unemployed and seeking
vocational rehabilitation services from the State of
 Pennsylvania.
 
82. [Bondu's] Income and Expense Statement (Exhibit
A) shows a negative balance of -$3,361.
 
83. When asked how she makes up the deficiency,
[Bondu] testified that she has two friends and a brother
that help her financially. However, no debts to such
friends or brother are listed in her Asset and Debt
 Statement.
 . . . .
 
84. [Bondu] has less than $4,416 in net debt.
Exhibit 12.
 
85. [Bradley] has $35,733 in debt he is solely liable
for and another $6,443 in joint debt that he has agreed to
be responsible for paying. Exhibit H and the parties' Feb.
24, 2012 stipulation.
 
86. In addition, [Bradley] was unable to pay any of
his $1,306 monthly estimated self-employment taxes for 2011
because of his attorney's fees and costs, and the $5,000 in
fees he was ordered to pay on behalf of [Bondu], for a total
 
5
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of $15,672 in unpaid taxes.
. . . .
 
87. [Bondu] seeks $3,000 a month in alimony from
[Bradley].
 
88. What specific factors she believes support this
alimony claim, or for how long, was not provided by [Bondu].
 
The family court's COL 5 restates factors that it
 
considers in determining a spousal support award under Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47(a)(1)-(13) (Supp. 2012).7 In
 
addition to considering the enumerated HRS § 580-47(a) factors,
 the family court applied "the 4-part test provided by the Vorfeld
 
7 HRS § 580-47(a) states in part:
 
§ 580-47 Support orders; division of property. (a) . . . .
 
In addition to any other relevant factors considered, the
court, in ordering spousal support and maintenance, shall consider
the following factors:
 
(1)	 Financial resources of the parties;
 
(2)	 Ability of the party seeking support and
maintenance to meet his or her needs independently;
 
(3)	 Duration of the marriage;
 
(4)	 Standard of living established during the
marriage;
 
(5)	 Age of the parties;
 
(6)	 Physical and emotional condition of the parties;
 
(7)	 Usual occupation of the parties during the marriage;
 
(8)	 Vocational skills and employability of the party
seeking support and maintenance;
 
(9)	 Needs of the parties;
 
(10)	 Custodial and child support responsibilities;
 
(11) 	Ability of the party from whom support and maintenance
is sought to meet his or her own needs while meeting
the needs of the party seeking support and
maintenance;
 
(12) 	Other factors which measure the financial condition in
 
which the parties will be left as the result of the
action under which the determination of maintenance is
 made; and
 
(13)	 Probable duration of the need of the party seeking
support and maintenance.

[v. Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App. 391, 804 P.2d 891 (1991)] case[.]" The
 
family court's COL 6 restates the Vorfeld analysis:
 
[T]he relevant circumstances are as follows. The first
 
relevant circumstance is the payee's need. What amount of
 money does he or she need to maintain the standard of living
established during the marriage? The second relevant
 circumstance is the payee's ability to meet his or her need
without spousal support. Taking into account the payee's
income, or what it should be, including the net income
producing capability of his or her property, what is his or
her reasonable ability to meet his or her need without
spousal support? The third relevant circumstance is the
 payor's need. What amount of money does he or she need to
maintain the standard of living established during the
marriage? The fourth relevant circumstance is the payor's
ability to pay spousal support. Taking into account the
payor's income, or what it should be, including the income
producing capability of his or her property, what is his or
her reasonable ability to meet his or her need and to pay
spousal support?
 
Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App. at 402-03, 804 P.2d at 897-98 (citing
 
Cassiday v. Cassiday, 6 Haw. App. 207, 215-16, 716 P.2d 1145,
 1151 (1985) aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 68 Haw. 383, 716 P.2d
 1133 (1986)).
 
In regard to Bondu's request for spousal support, the
 
family court concluded: 
7. Applying the foregoing findings of fact to the
factors outlined by HRS § 580-47(a) and the 4-part test
provided by the Vorfeld case, [Bondu] has failed to
demonstrate the [sic] an award of alimony to her is
necessary for her to maintain a standard of living
established during the marriage, or that [Bradley] has the
ability to pay spousal support.
 
The family court denied Bondu's spousal support claim. 
Bondu submitted a Motion for Reconsideration, which the family
 
court denied on April 23, 2012 and issued the Divorce Decree. 
Bondu filed her Notice of Appeal on May 22, 2012, raising the
 divorce decree's denial of "[a]limony and other relief" as the
 subject of the appeal.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai� i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai� i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
"A court abuses its discretion whenever it exceeds the
 
bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or
 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party." Barbee v.
 
Queen's Med. Ctr., 119 Hawai� i 136, 152, 194 P.3d 1098, 1114 
(App. 2008) (Internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). 
"Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of discretion is
 on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it." 
Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai� i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 1180, 1185-86 
(2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets
 omitted). 
In cases of conflicting evidence, the credibility of
the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are
within the province of the trial court and, generally, will
not be disturbed on appeal. It is not the function of
 appellate courts to second-guess the trier of fact where
there is substantial evidence in the record to support its
conclusion.
 
Barbee, 119 Hawai� i at 152, 194 P.3d at 1114 (citation omitted). 
FOFs - Family Court 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal under the
"clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is clearly erroneous when (1)
the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or
(2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the
appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been made. "Substantial evidence"
 is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative
value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
Fisher, 111 Hawai� i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
COLs - Family Court 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is
freely reviewable for its correctness. [An appellate] court
ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard.
Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial court's FOFs and
that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will
not be overturned. However, a COL that presents mixed
questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly
 
8
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are
 
dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each
individual case.
 
Schiller v. Schiller, 120 Hawai� i 283, 288, 205 P.3d 548, 553 
(App. 2009) (quoting Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys. 
of the State of Hawai i, 106 Hawai� i 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 
(2005)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
We review the family court's COLs under a right/wrong 
standard. Schiller, 120 Hawai� i at 288, 205 P.3d at 553. The 
family court's COL 6 applied the Vorfeld four-factor "alimony analysis" along with HRS § 580-47(a) factors to Bondu's request for spousal support. We note Vorfeld concerned appellate review of an order modifying spousal support, as opposed to initial spousal support under review here. 
The factors underlying an initial alimony determination
 
differ from the standard for a modification where a court must
 assess whether a "material change in circumstances" has occurred
 since the divorce. Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App. at 402, 804 P.2d at 897. 
This contextual difference does not render the family court's
 application of the enumerated four circumstances in Vorfeld
 erroneous, however, because the "relevant circumstances"
 considered in determining initial spousal support apply to the
 question of modification.
8 Id. at 402-03, 804 P.2d at 897-98.
 
8 Vorfeld added a fourth relevant circumstance to the three-part
 
Cassiday analysis: "[w]hat amount of money does [the payor] need to maintain
the standard of living established during the marriage?" Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App.
 
at 403, 804 P.2d at 897. Under Cassiday,
 
the most relevant factual questions are sequentially as
follows:
 
1. Taking into account the property awarded in
the divorce case to the party seeking spousal
support, what amount, if any, does he or she
need to maintain the standard of living
established during the marriage?
 
2. Taking into account the income of the party
seeking spousal support, or what it should be,
and the income producing capability of the
property awarded to him or her in the divorce
action, what is his or her ability to meet his
(continued...)
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(...continued)8
or her need independently? . . . .
3.  Taking into account the income of the party
from whom spousal support is sought, or what it
should be, and the income producing capability
of the property awarded to him or her in the
divorce action, what is his or her ability to
meet his or her needs while meeting the need for
spousal support of the party seeking spousal
support?
Cassiday, 6 Haw. App. at 215, 716 P.2d at 1151. 
10Applying HRS § 580-47(a) factors and the Vorfeld/
Cassiday alimony analysis, the family court concluded in COL 7,
that Bondu "failed to demonstrate the [sic ] an award of alimony
to her is necessary for her to maintain a standard of living
established during the marriage, or that [Bradley] has the
ability to pay spousal support."  The family court's FOFs and
COLs disregarded testimony from the parties and were clearly
erroneous.  The family court essentially concluded that the
amount Bondu needed to maintain the standard of living
established during the marriage was (-)$3,361 per month.
The family court made the following FOFs concerning
Bondu's capacity to meet her needs independently:
70.  Despite her back condition, [Bondu] continued to
work as a caretaker on Oahu and in Pennsylvania up until
2011.  [Bondu] claims she was laid off from her last job not
because of her back or any medically related issue, but
because she was not licensed as a [caretaker].
71.  No evidence was offered concerning what treatment
or accommodations, if any, [Bondu] requires for her back
condition, nor how it effects her now versus in previous
years.
 . . . .
74.  No evidence of what services, if any, that
[Bondu] needs to address her illiteracy, or need for
education, was submitted.  [Bondu's] current unemployment is
unrelated to illiteracy.
. . . .
88.  What specific factors she believes support this
alimony claim, or for how long, was not provided by [Bondu].
These FOFs are clearly erroneous because substantial
evidence does not support them.  In fact, the evidence presentedNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is contrary to these findings. FOFs 71 and 74 found Bondu failed
 
to produce evidence that links her back condition and illiteracy
 to her current unemployment. Letters and testimony from Bondu's
 doctors identified her back condition and treatments without
 albeit opining how they impacted her employment prospects. 
Bondu, however, testified that she cannot take jobs as a nanny or
 cleaning houses because "it's gotten to a point, my back. I live
 on ibuprofen, and my doctor know that, and muscle relaxer. 
Sometime I can't sit too long. My back gets stuck." Bradley
 also acknowledged Bondu "would throw out her back at times,"
 received muscle relaxant medical treatment for that condition,
 and "at times it [her back pain] was a problem [in 'taking care
 of her activities, the daily living or her work,'] if she had to
 turn someone over or something." FOFs 71 and 74 erroneously
 disregard Bondu and Bradley's testimony and exhibits linking
 Bondu's back pains to her ability to work.
 
FOFs 70 and 74 found Bondu was terminated from Vision
 
Care employment because she lacked a caretaker license and that
 Bondu's current unemployment is not related to her illiteracy. 
These findings disregard evidence that linked Bondu's inability
 to obtain a caretaker license to her lack of English language
 skills. Bondu testified at trial that she was not able to get
 the caretaker license "[b]ecause I can't read." Bondu's English
 language teacher also testified that Bondu cannot read and
 comprehend written documents.
 
The family court's FOFs 70, 71, and 74 found that 
Bondu's current unemployment was unrelated to either her back condition or literacy levels. The record lacks substantial evidence to support these FOFs and rather indicates Bondu's unemployment is related to her health and illiteracy. Although "the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are within the province of the trial court," this court is not prohibited from challenging the trier of fact where there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the fact-finder's conclusion. Compare Barbee, 119 Hawai� i at 152, 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
194 P.3d at 1114 ("appellate courts [do not] second-guess the
 
trier of fact where there is substantial evidence in the record
 to support its conclusion.") (Emphasis added.)
 
Additionally, the family court's FOF 88 is not
 
supported by facts and filings in the record. FOF 88 states
 "[w]hat specific factors she believes support this alimony claim,
 or for how long, was not provided by [Bondu]." On March 12,
 2012, prior to the family court's FOF/COL/Order, Bondu filed her
 "Reply to [Bradley's] Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 of Law," which claimed spousal support "for the rest of [Bondu]'s
 life" and cited to facts supporting the application of specific
 factors to Bondu's spousal support claim:
 
[Bradley] earns $102,396 a year and Defendant '0'.
[Bradley] has a job pursuant to a three year contract, holds
a doctorate degree, and has been able to have gainful
employment throughout his adult life. He was supported by
[Bondu], who has raised his children and continues to be the
matriarch of her family serving as the base for the children
to visit and call home.
 
. . . . 
[Bradley] makes $8,533 a month and providing [Bondu] $3,500
a month ($1,590 child support and as child support is
reduced spousal support would increase) would leave
[Bradley] $5,000 a month. [Bradley] would be able to deduct
the spousal support obligation which effectively reduces his
obligation and [Bondu] would have to pay taxes which
effectively reduces the amount she actually will need to
live upon.
 
Facts concerning the parties' income and employment
 
potential are "financial resources[;]" and Bradley's ability to
 
pay and "needs" are relevant factors under HRS § 580-47(a). HRS
 § 580-47(a)(1), (9), and (11). Bondu specified facts and factors
 supporting her spousal support claim.
 
The family court may properly consider the amount
 
Bradley needs to maintain the standard of living established
 while he was married and his ability to pay spousal support,
 "[t]aking into account the payor's income, or what it should be,
 including the income producing capability of his or her
 property[.]" Vorfeld, 8 Haw. App. at 03, 804 P.2d at 897-98. 
The family court did not list Bradley's income amongst its "Facts
 Re Financial Condition of the Parties." Bradley's income has
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
increased and his gross annual income at the time of trial was
 
$102,396 per year, while Bondu's was zero.
 
Finally, the family court erred by concluding that
 
Bondu had not shown that Bradley has the ability to pay spousal
 support. Bradley admitted that he "could" pay for alimony,
 adding "I [Bradley] would have to pay down less of a debt,
 basically, if I was paying alimony." In response to an inquiry
 into his desire to pay alimony, Bradley said, "[b]asically, you
 know, to me, my first priority right now is the children's
 education. And then also I have to pay down the debt, because
 retirement will be coming eventually."
IV. CONCLUSION
