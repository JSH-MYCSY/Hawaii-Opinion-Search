Plaintiff-Appellant Jose M. Rojas Reyes (Reyes) appeals
 
from the following judgments and orders entered by the Circuit

Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) :
(1) "Order Denying Plaintiff [Reyes's] Motion to Set

Judgment, and (2) Judgment as to All Claims Against Defendant

 Motion to Reconsider);
 
(3) "Order Granting Defendant [Fremont's] Motion for

2012;  and
(5) "Final Judgment as to All Claims Against Defendant
 
[Fremont]," filed April 26, 2012 (the Fremont Judgment).
 
Reyes raises the following points of error:
 (A) The Circuit Court erred in entering the Order
 
Denying Motion to Set Aside because newly discovered evidence
 obtained by Reyes would have changed the outcome of HSBC's motion
 for summary judgment.
 
(B) The Circuit Court committed "a grave and manifest
 
error of law" by granting Fremont's motion for summary judgment
 because there were "numerous issues of material fact" regarding
 
4
"kick back payments" made to Reyes's mortgage broker  and the
2 By order of this court entered on July 11, 2014, SGGH LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, was allowed, without objection, to
substitute as a party for Fremont.
 
3 Reyes fails to present any discernable argument regarding his
challenge to this order. Therefore, we deem this challenge waived. Hawaii
 Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) and (6).
 
4 As alleged in the "First Amended Complaint for Declaratory
Judgment as to Ownership of Title to the Real Property Located at 648 KaakoluStreet, Lahaina, Hawaii 96761 and For Injunctive Relief and Actual, Treble andPunitive Damages," (FAC), Christie Ann Ramirez "served as the licensedmortgage solicitor on behalf of Charter Funding/First Magnus involved in theunderlying mortgage loan transaction." It does not appear from the recordthat Ms. Ramirez was served with the FAC. First Magnus Financial Corporation,an Arizona Corporation doing business in the State of Hawai' i as Charter 
Funding (Magnus), designated as a "Nominal Defendant," was served, in Arizona. 
In his February 7, 2012 memorandum in opposition to Fremont's
motion for summary judgment, Reyes claimed that Magnus has "since gone into
bankruptcy and, despite [Reyes's] best efforts, Mrs. Ramirez cannot be
located." Ms. Ramirez, hereinafter referred to as "Broker," and her employer,

underwriting procedure used by Fremont as well as "unsettled
 
questions of law" regarding breach of a mortgage broker's
 fiduciary duty and the bank inducing the breach.
 
(C) Abuse of discretion by the Circuit Court when it
 
denied Reyes's motion to reconsider summary judgment awarded to
 Fremont where there were genuine issues of fact.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the applicable authority, and the
 record, we resolve Reyes's points on appeal as follows and
 affirm.
 
(A) The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion 
when it denied Reyes's March 16, 2012 non-hearing motion to set aside the October 18, 2011 order granting HSBC and MERS's motion for summary judgment and December 6, 2011 final judgment entered in HSBC and MERS's favor on all claims against them (Motion to Set Aside).
5 In his Motion to Set Aside, Reyes relied on Hawai 'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(2) and (6) and alleged as its basis, "surprise, newly discovered evidence, fraud, and the additional reasons set forth in the attached" memorandum, affidavit and exhibits. However, in his memorandum in support, his argument focused only on the newly discovered evidence ground.
6 "Much discretion is afforded to a trial court in 
deciding whether to set aside a judgment under HRCP Rule 60(b)." Keahole Def. Coal., Inc. v. Bd. of Land & Natural Res., 110 Hawai
'i 419, 436, 134 P.3d 585, 602 (2006). 
While far from clear, the newly discovered evidence
 
upon which Reyes relies is apparently not composed of the
 documents supporting a catering business or bank statements for a
 "Jose H. Rojas Reyes" that Reyes does not dispute were provided
 to him before the hearing on HSBC's motion for summary judgment, 
4(...continued)
Magnus, were voluntarily dismissed as parties without prejudice on April 5,
2012.
 
5
 We note that Reyes does not appeal from the underlying December 6,
2011 judgment entered in favor of HSBC and MERS.
 
6
 To be sure, Reyes argued many things in his memorandum in support,
including that the non-judicial sale of the subject property was void because
it was not conducted in compliance with statute, but he did not couch these
arguments in terms of HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
but rather, the significance of these documents that he received
 
from HSBC in discovery, i.e., that they were, according to Reyes,
 "false" and were submitted to Fremont by Broker and relied upon
 by Fremont in deciding to make the loan to Reyes. 
Reyes cites no authority for the proposition that
 
realization of the significance of previously obtained evidence
 qualifies as "newly discovered evidence" under HRCP Rule 60(b)
 and we find none. Evidence is not considered newly discovered if
 it is in the moving party's possession at the time of trial or
 hearing on the motion. Coastal Transfer Co. v. Toyota Motor
 
Sales, U.S.A., 833 F.2d 208, 211-12 (9th Cir. 1987) (interpreting
 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)). Once the evidence
 is in the moving party's possession, the onus is upon him or her
 to exercise due diligence in examining and analyzing the
 significance of that evidence. Id. ("This fact of possession
 
also makes clear that Coastal did not use due diligence to
 discover its expert's error. The fact that Walters analyzed data
 from the wrong year should have been apparent to anyone familiar
 with the date of Coastal's termination by Toyota.")
 
We cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in denying Reyes's Motion to Set Aside. 
(B) The Circuit Court did not err in granting
 
Fremont's motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted
 summary judgment to Fremont as to Counts Two, Three, and Six of
 the FAC. We review the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment
 de novo. Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 
697 (2005). Accordingly,
 
[o]n appeal, an order of summary judgment is reviewed under
the same standard applied by the circuit courts. Summary
judgment is proper where the moving party demonstrates that
there are no genuine issues of material fact and it is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In other words,
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties." Crichfield v. 
Grand Wailea Co., 93 Hawai

"[A] 'genuine issue as to any material fact' . . . as to a particular matter must be of such a nature that it would affect the result." Richards v. Midkiff, 48 Haw. 32, 39, 396 P.2d 49, 
54 (1964). 
In reviewing a circuit court's grant or denial of a 
motion for summary judgment, the appellate court "must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Crichfield, 93 
Hawai
'i at 483, 6 P.3d at 355 (citation,internal quotation marks,

'i 516, 521, 904 
P.2d 530, 535 (App. 1995). 
(1) Summary judgment was properly granted with
 
regard to Count Two. Count Two, a request for declaratory
 judgment, rescission and common law damages, vaguely asserted
8
 
that the "Notes and Mortgages and as may have been assigned are
 void and unenforceable as procured by deceit and
 misrepresentation." In the only two statements of fact arguably
 
7
 HRCP Rule 56(c) provides, in relevant part:
 
The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law. A summary judgment, interlocutory in
character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone
although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of
damages.

relevant to Fremont's participation in the making of the loan,
 
Reyes alleged, 
16. Upon information and belief, material information
on Reyes'[s] loan application and/or information submitted
to the lender's underwriters, including the amount of
Reyes'[s] gross monthly income, was falsified by Fremont,
[Magnus], and [Broker], for the purpose of qualifying Reyes
for a loan he could never afford, so that [Magnus] and
[Broker] could earn a large commission and so that Fremont
could sell the loans for profit on the secondary mortgage
market.
 
17. Upon closing the transaction, [Magnus] and
[Broker] received a large commission for their involvement.
 "A claim for fraud involves 'a knowing 
misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact 
to induce another to act to his or her detriment.' Fisher v. Grove Farm Co., Inc., 123 Hawai

P.3d 394, 416 n.33 (2014). "The elements of fraud are: (1) false representations made by the defendant; (2) with knowledge of their falsity (or without knowledge of their truth or falsity); (3) in contemplation of plaintiff's reliance upon them; and
 (4) plaintiff's detrimental reliance." Miyashiro v. Roehrig,

'i 461, 482-83, 228 P.3d 341,

Normally, "the statements contained in a [loan application] are the applicant's own statements regarding his income." Infante v. Bank of Am. 
Corp., 680 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1304 (S.D.Fla. 2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Such statements are representations by the applican--i.e., the plaintiff--not by a lender, and thus cannot be the basis of a fraud claim by a plaintiff against that lender." Long v.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Reyes argued in opposition to Fremont's motion for
 
summary judgment that, 
[t]he factual allegations [in support of the fraud claim]
include that [Reyes's] monthly income as misstated by the
mortgage broker on his loan application and that false
information was submitted to Fremont. This allegation
states a cause of action for fraud committed by the mortgage
broker sufficient enough to invalidate the mortgage loans.
Defendant Fremont is liable for this fraud, as it induced
the mortgage broker's actions by offering a large payment in
exchange for ensuring [Reyes] was put into these loans.
 
Reyes did not allege in the FAC a claim that Fremont
 
was responsible for the actions of Broker. For this reason
 
alone, we could affirm the Circuit Court's grant of summary
 judgment. Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058,
 
1080 (9th Cir. 2008) ("where, as here, the complaint does not
 include the necessary factual allegations to state a claim,
 raising such claim in a summary judgment motion is insufficient
 to present the claim to the district court").
 
Even if we were to overlook this failure of pleading, 
Reyes approached, and presumably engaged, Magnus to act as his broker in this transaction. "In general, a lender is not liable for the actions of a mortgage broker unless there [sic] 'there is an agency relationship between the lender and the broker.'" Menashe, 850 F. Supp. 2d at 1135 quoting Gonzalez v. First Franklin Loan Servs., 2010 WL 144862, at *13 (E.D.Cal. Jan. 11, 2010). To hold Fremont responsible for Broker's acts, it was incumbent on Reyes to present evidence that Fremont granted Magnus/Broker actual or apparent authority. U.S. Bank Nat'l 
Assn. v. Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 173, 338 P.3d 1185, 1188 
(App. 2014). Reyes points to no such evidence in the record. 
In opposition to Fremont's motion for summary judgment,
 
Reyes argued for the first time that, by offering Broker a "Yield
 Spread Premium," (YSP)
9
 
9
 
A yield spread premium is calculated based upon the
difference between the interest rate at which the broker
 originates the loan and the par, or market, rate offered by
a lender. The Department [of Housing and Urban Development]
believes, and industry and consumers agree, that a yield
spread premium can be a useful means to pay some or all of a
borrower's settlement costs. In these cases, lender payments
reduce the up front cash requirements to borrowers. In some
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fremont clearly should have known that the promise of such a
lucrative payment would induce the mortgage broker to breach
its fiduciary duty to the Plaintiff. 
This type of inducement by Fremont also created an
impermissible "dual agency" in which the mortgage broker was
acting as an agent of not only the Plaintiff, but also of
Defendant Fremont.
 
However, the exhibit Reyes presented to the Circuit Court shows
 
that it was the Broker that asked for the YSP, not Fremont who
 offered it to the Broker to close the transaction. Furthermore,
 the YSP may have been permissible as Reyes points to no evidence
 that the YSP was not for goods or services actually provided and
 were not reasonably related to the value of those goods or
 services. 
12 USC § 2607, supra.
 
9(...continued)
cases, borrowers are able to obtain loans without paying any
up front cash for the services required in connection with
the origination of the loan. Instead, the fees for these
services are financed through a higher interest rate on the
loan. The yield spread premium thus can be a legitimate
tool to assist the borrower. The availability of this
option fosters homeownership.
 
. . . .
 HUD also recognizes, however, that in some cases less
scrupulous brokers and lenders take advantage of the
complexity of the settlement transaction and use yield
spread premiums as a way to enhance the profitability of
mortgage transactions without offering the borrower lower up
front fees. In these cases, yield spread premiums serve to
increase the borrower's interest rate and the broker's
 overall compensation, without lowering up front cash
requirements for the borrower. As set forth in this
 Statement of Policy, such uses of yield spread premiums may
result in total compensation in excess of what is reasonably
related to the total value of the origination services
provided by the broker, and fail to comply with the second
part of HUD's two-part test as enunciated in the 1999
Statement of Policy, and with Section 8.
 
. . . .
 In determining whether a payment from a lender to a mortgage
broker is permissible under Section 8 of [Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)], the first question is
whether goods or facilities were actually furnished or
services were actually performed for the compensation paid.
The fact that goods or facilities have been actually
furnished or that services have been actually performed by
the mortgage broker does not by itself make the payment
legal. The second question is whether the payments are
reasonably related to the value of the goods or facilities
that were actually furnished or services that were actually
performed.

The Circuit Court was correct in granting summary
 
judgment as to Count Two.
 
(2) The Circuit Court was correct in entering
 
summary judgment as to Count Three, alleging a violation of HRS
 
Chapter 480 (UDAP).
 
Hawai'i law indicates that a mortgage loan transaction
"falls within the ambit of HRS [Chapter] 480[.]" Hawaii
Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai' i 213, 227, 11
P.3d 1, 15 (2000) (citing Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty,Inc., 80 Hawai' i 54, 905 P.2d 29 (1995)). HRS § 480–2
states that "[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair ordeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade orcommerce are unlawful." Under Hawai' i law, "[a] deceptive
act or practice is (1) a representation, omission, orpractice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers actingreasonably under the circumstances where (3) therepresentation, omission, or practice is material." Courbat 
v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai' i 254, 262, 141 P.3d 427,
435 (2006) (citation, internal quotation marks and bracketsomitted). 
Salvacion, 134 Hawai 'i at 173-74, 338 P.3d at 1188-89. 
Count Three of the FAC vaguely asserted that "the acts
 
complained of above constitut[ed] unfair and deceptive acts and
 
practices against consumers, as defined and proscribed in Chapter
 480" of HRS. In opposition to summary judgment, Reyes ultimately
 asserted that the Notes and Mortgages were void (1) as products
 of deceit under HRS § 480-12 (2008); and (2) as substantively
 unfair under HRS § 480-2 (2008).
 
As stated, both of Reyes's asserted UDAP claims are 
time-barred under HRS § 480-24 (2008). HRS § 480-24 provides that "[a]ny action to enforce a cause of action arising under this Chapter [UDAP] shall be barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrues[.]" HRS § 480-24(a) (emphasis added).
10 As Hawai 'i federal courts have held, a cause 
of action for unlawful business practices accrues upon occurrence of alleged violation, rather than when plaintiff discovers the violation. See McDevitt v. Guenther, 522 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1289 
(D. Hawai
'i 2007). Therefore, Reyes's asserted cause of action 
accrued on November 16, 2005, when Reyes signed the loan documents. Swartz v. City Mortg. Inc., 911 F. Supp. 2d 916, 941­
10
 "This chapter shall be construed in accordance with judicial
interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes, except that lawsuits by
indirect purchasers may be brought as provided in this chapter." HRS § 480-3
(2008).

42 (D. Hawai 'i 2012), abrogated on other grounds by Compton v. 
Countrywide Fin. Corp., 761 F.3d 1046 (2014). On March 15, 2010, 
Reyes filed his original complaint, initiating the instant action. Therefore, Reyes's lawsuit was filed more than four years after he signed the allegedly fraudulent loan application and so is time-barred by HRS § 480-24. 
Reyes argues that HRS § 480-24 is inapplicable because
 
(1) his claim for declaratory judgment was brought under HRS
 Chapter 632, not HRS § 480-13; and (2) there is no cause of
 action per se because HRS § 480-12 operates to void the contract
 as a matter of law. Reyes's arguments are without merit.
 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. And we must read
statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
 
Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai 'i 254, 260, 141 P.3d 
427, 433 (2006) (quoting Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 84 
Hawai'i 138, 148, 931 P.2d 580, 590 (1997)). The plain language 
of HRS § 480-24 applies it to "[a]ny action to enforce a cause of action arising under this chapter[.]" HRS § 480-24. Reyes seeks "to enforce a cause of action" that arises under HRS § 480-12. Reyes brought "any action" in the form of an action for declaratory relief, rescission, and treble damages. Therefore, HRS § 480-24 applies. 
Reyes argues that, even if the time bar under HRS
 
§ 480-24 applies to his UDAP claims, that "statute should have
 been tolled because the unfair scheme was fraudulently concealed
 from Reyes." This is essentially an argument for equitable
 tolling. 
"'Equitable tolling' is defined as '[t]he doctrine that 
the statute of limitations will not bar a claim if the plaintiff, despite diligent efforts, did not discover the injury until after the limitations period had expired.'" Narmore v. Kawafuchi, 112 
Hawai
'i 69, 75 n.15, 143 P.3d 1271, 1277 n.15 (2006) (quoting

In order to toll a statute of limitations for a complaint
filed after its expiration, a plaintiff must demonstrate
"(1) that he . . . has been pursuing his right diligently,
and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his
way." Felter v. Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d 118, 126 (D.D.C.
2006) (citing Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 417, 125
S.Ct. 1807, 1814, 161 L.Ed. 2d 669 (2005); Zerilli–Edelglass
v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 333 F.3d 74, 80–81 (2d Cir.
2003)). Extraordinary circumstances are circumstances that
are beyond the control of the complainant and make it
impossible to file a complaint within the statute of
limitations. Id. (citing United States v. Cicero, 214 F.3d
199, 203 (D.C.Cir. 2000)).
 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 Hawai 'i 338, 360, 133 
P.3d 767, 789 (2006). 
Equitable tolling has been applied to circumstances
 
closely resembling the instant case. In Rundgren v. Bank of New
 
York Mellon, 777 F. Supp. 2d 1224, 1230 (D. Hawai 'i 2011), the 
mortgagor filed a state court suit against lenders, seeking
 damages and rescission of mortgage loans based on alleged unfair
 and deceptive trade practices in violation of Hawai
'i law, and 
alleging wrongful foreclosure. The court held that federal
 equitable tolling principles applied to claims under HRS § 480-12
 if based on fraudulent concealment: 
To avoid the bar of limitation by invoking the concept of
fraudulent concealment, the plaintiff must allege facts
showing affirmative conduct upon the part of the defendant
which would, under the circumstances of the case, lead a
reasonable person to believe that he did not have a claim
for relief. Silence or passive conduct of the defendant is
not deemed fraudulent, unless the relationship of the
parties imposes a duty upon the defendant to make
disclosure. A plaintiff must plead with particularity the
circumstances surrounding the concealment and state facts
showing his due diligence in trying to uncover the facts.
 
Rundgren, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 1230 (emphasis added, citation and
 
internal quotation marks omitted, format altered). Thus, to toll
 the statute of limitations for a UDAP claim, equitable tolling
 based on fraudulent concealment may be available.
 
However, we need not decide whether equitable tolling
 
applies to UDAP claims because Reyes did not plead concealment by
 Fremont with particularity. In Reyes's FAC, he included a single 
statement of fact describing the information in and in support of
 the loan application:
 
11
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
16. Upon information and belief, material information
on Reyes'[s] loan application and/or information submitted
to the lender's underwriters, including the amount of
Reyes'[s] gross monthly income, was falsified by Fremont,
[Magnus], and [Broker], for the purpose of qualifying Reyes
for a loan he could never afford, so that [Magnus] and
[Broker] could earn a large commission and so that Fremont
could sell the loans for profit on the secondary mortgage
market.
 
The statement alleges that Fremont, along with Magnus and Broker
 
submitted "falsified" information, but the only information
 specified as being false was his gross monthly income. Moreover,
 Reyes did not allege how Fremont affirmatively hid the allegedly
 falsified information from Reyes, nor did he allege his own
 exercise of due diligence to discover that this false information
 had been submitted "to the lender's underwriters." 
In his opposition to Fremont's motion for summary
 
judgment, Reyes asserted that he was rushed through the signing
 of all closing documents in order to conceal the fraud in the
 application and that he was unaware that Broker submitted
 falsified documents, including fictionalized business and bank
 accounts, with his loan application. Of these additional
 allegations, neither are attributed directly to Fremont.
11
 
Therefore Reyes has failed to assert, at any time, that Fremont
 affirmatively concealed the nature of the UDAP violations.
 
11 Relying on two unpublished federal court cases, Reyes argues,
contrary to Rundgren, that it does not matter who committed the fraudulent
concealment because the purpose of equitable tolling is to extend a statutory
limitation period for those who were defrauded and unaware that they had a
cause of action. Long v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., 2011 WL 2650219
 
(D. Hawai' i Jul. 5, 2011) and Skaggs v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 2011 WL 3861373 
(D. Hawai' i Aug. 31, 2011). However, the United States District Court for the
District of Hawai' i (District Court) did not, in either case, consider the
issue of equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment, but whether theplaintiff had sufficiently alleged a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.Long, 2011 WL 2650219 at *6, Skaggs, 2011 WL 3861373 at *6. 
Furthermore, in Long, although the District Court granted Long
leave to amend the fraud claim citing the possibility that a claim might be
made out against the mortgage broker, it dismissed the claim against both the
originator-lender of the loan and the assignee of the note, implying no good
claim could be made against either financial institution based on the
fraudulent actions of the broker. Long, at *8-9. Although the District Court
denied the lender's motion for summary judgment in Skaggs, it did so based on
its finding of genuine issues of material fact based on sufficient allegations
in the complaint. Skaggs, 2011 WL 3861373 at *8. Neither case supports the
notion that an insufficiently pleaded claim can survive summary judgment let
alone serve as a basis for tolling.

Finally, Reyes did not plead, nor did he argue in
 
opposition to Fremont's motion for summary judgment, that he
 
exercised due diligence to discover the concealed UDAP
 violations. Although Reyes claimed that he was not given time to
 review the loan documents at signing, he did not claim, let alone
 present evidence that he never received a copy of his loan
 application, which would have revealed, upon examination, the
 gross monthly income that he claims was vastly overstated. 
Without any evidence of due diligence, Reyes failed to establish
 a genuine issue of material fact regarding the tolling of the
 statute of limitations on his UDAP claim in Count Three.
 
The Circuit Court did not err when it granted summary
 
judgment on Reyes's UDAP claim.
 
(3) The Circuit Court did not err in granting
 
summary judgment as to Count Six. Count Six of Reyes's FAC
 asserted that the acts complained of "were done in a willful,
 wanton, intentional, and/or reckless manner . . . for which Reyes
 is entitled to an award of punitive and exemplary damages[.]"
 However, Reyes does not present any argument explaining how the
 Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment in Fremont's
 favor on this count. Therefore, we deem this argument waived. 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
(C) Reyes argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
denied his motion to reconsider the grant of summary judgment to
 Fremont.
 
"[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated
motion." Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding.

disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
 
substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v.
 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26
 (1992).
 
Reyes has failed to show the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration. He fails
 to argue what new evidence or argument, that could not have been
 presented in opposing Fremont's motion for summary judgment, was
 raised in his motion to reconsider. Rather, he argues that the
 Circuit Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for
 reconsideration made on the basis of constructive fraud. 
However, Reyes's memorandum in support of his motion does not
 discuss constructive fraud.
 
Reyes's last point of error is without merit.
 Therefore, we affirm the
