("Deutsche Bank") against Rosana in the Circuit Court on
 
October 11, 2011. Rosana did not answer or otherwise respond to
 the complaint. On January 6, 2012, the clerk of the Circuit
 Court entered defaults against Rosana. Following the entry of
 the FOF/COL and the Judgment, Deutsche Bank filed "Plaintiff's
 Motion for Permission to Sell Property Without Open Houses" on
 May 8, 2012 ("Motion for Permission to Sell").
 
Rosana filed a Notice of Appeal from the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and the FOF/COL on May 23, 2012. Shortly thereafter, on May 29, 2012, Borrower filed "Defendant's Objection to Plaintiff's Motion for Permission to Sell Property Without Open House; Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment; To Set Aside Default; For Evidentiary Hearing, and for Leave to File Responsive Pleading" ("First Rule 60(b) Motion") pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 60(b)(3) and (4) 
On June 12, 2012, Borrower filed "Defendant Rosalina
 
Bautista Rosana's Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment; To
 Set Aside Default; For Evidentiary Hearing, and for Leave to File
 Responsive Pleading" ("Second Rule 60(b) Motion") pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) and (4). In both motions, Borrower argued
 that Deutsche Bank lacked standing to foreclose and that the
 Judgment was void because it was obtained by fraud. There is no
 order in the record regarding either HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. On
 October 10, 2012, the Circuit Court entered the order granting
 Deutsche Bank's Motion for Permission to Sell. 
On appeal, Rosana asserts that the Circuit Court erred:
 
(1) "in granting summary judgment to plaintiff-appellee since
 there were obvious inconsistencies on the face of the assignment
 by which plaintiff-appellee claimed its standing to foreclose";
 and (2) "in denying Ms. Rosana's [Second Rule 60(b) Motion]." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the
 parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments they
 advance and the issues they raise as well as the relevant
 statutory and case law, we resolve Rosana's points of error as
 follows, and affirm.
 
(1) As to the first point of error, Rosana contends
 
that the Circuit Court erred in granting Deutsche Bank's motion
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
for summary judgment, because, she claims, the documents that
 
Deutsche Bank offered in support of its motion did not meet the
 requirements of HRCP Rule 56(e). She also challenges the
 validity of the "Assignment of Mortgage and Note" recorded on
 October 14, 2011 and filed in the Bureau of Conveyances, State of
 Hawaii ("Assignment"), under which New Century Home Equity Loan
 Trust 2006-1's interest in the Mortgage and promissory note were
 assigned to Deutsche Bank. We disagree and hold that the Circuit
 Court did not err in granting Deutsche Bank's motion for summary
 judgment and decree of foreclosure.
 
This court has held that when an entry of default has 
not been set aside in a foreclosure action, the mortgagor may assert a claim to the surplus proceeds of the public sale of the mortgaged property, but does not have standing to contest the merits of the summary judgment motion. See Deutsche Bank Nat'l 
Trust Co. v. Tejada, No. 30654, 2011 WL 4840995, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2011) (citing Bank of Haw. v. Horwoth, 71 Haw. 204, 214–16, 787 P.2d 674, 680–81 (1990)). Moreover, Rosana fails to demonstrate any error. The arguments advanced on appeal were not raised below in opposition to the FOF/COL. Thus, we consider those arguments waived, and decline to hear the matter further. See Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dept., 96 Hawai
'i 243, 251, 30 P.3d 
257, 265 (2001). 
(2) As to the second point of error, we do not have
 
jurisdiction to review Rosana's contentions regarding the HRCP
 Rule 60(b) motions.
 
Rosana filed a Notice of Appeal from the April 23, 2012 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and FOF/COL on May 23, 2012. The two HRCP Rule 60(b) motions were filed on May 29 and June 12, 2012, more than ten days after the April 23, 2012 judgment, and thus cannot be considered as tolling motions under Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(3). See Ass'n of Condo. Homeowners 
of Tropics at Waikele ex rel. Bd. of Directors v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai
'i 254, 256, 318 P.3d 94, 96 (2013) ("Under HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3), a timely post-judgment motion tolls the time to file a notice of appeal until thirty days after the entry of an order disposing of the motion.") (emphasis added); Lambert v. Lua, 92

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 228, 234, 990 P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999) ("An HRCP Rule 
60(b) motion for relief from judgment may toll the period for 
appealing a judgment or order . . . if the motion is served and filed within ten (10) days after the judgment is entered.") (citation omitted). Moreover, there is no order disposing of 
2
either motion in the record,  and no notice of appeal regardingeither HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. See Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. 
Casey, 98 Hawai
'i 159, 166, 45 P.3d 359, 366 (2002) (holding that 
a notice of appeal from the circuit court's disposition of an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion relating to the matters finally determined in a foreclosure decree must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the HRCP Rule 60(b) judgment in order for appellate jurisdiction to exist). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over either HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. 
Therefore, the "Notice of Entry of Judgment" and the
 
"Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Motion for
 Summary Judgment As Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory
 Decree of Foreclosure" filed on April 23, 2012, in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit are affirmed.

 Even if Rosana had included the alleged denial of the Second Rule
60(b) Motion in the record on appeal, we could not review the matter. Rosana 
purports to appeal from a July 1, 2012 minute order denying the Second Rule60(b) Motion. As such, Rosana's appeal from the denial of the Second Rule60(b) Motion would be premature, and we would lack jurisdiction over that
aspect of the appeal. See Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88
Hawai'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (holding that "a minute
order is not an appealable order."); Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Amasol,
No. SCWC 13-0000040, 2015 WL 1725791, at *2 (Haw. Apr. 14, 2015) (affirmingportion of Intermediate Court of Appeals' order determining that appeal fromdenial of amended HRCP Rule 60(b) motion was premature because no writtenorder had been filed).
