1 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On appeal, Appellants raise two points of error,2
 
contending that the District Court erred when: (1) it entered
 
its February 13, 2012 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession filed November 14, 2011,
 
February 23, 2012 Judgment for Possession, and February 23, 2012
 
Writ of Possession; and (2) it entered the Order Denying Relief.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we address
 
Appellants' points of error as follows:
 
"[A]ppellate courts are under an obligation to insure 
that they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case." 
State v. Moniz, 69 Haw. 370, 372, 742 P.2d 373, 375 (1987). We 
therefore, sua sponte, raise the issue of appellate jurisdiction 
in this case. The District Court's February 23, 2012 Judgment 
for Possession and Writ of Possession were immediately appealable 
under the Forgay doctrine. See, e.g., Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 
Hawai'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). However, Appellants 
did not file an appeal from the February 23, 2012 Judgment for 
Possession and Writ of Possession within thirty days, as required 
by Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a). Nor 
did they file a post-judgment motion within ten days, as it would 
have extended the time period for filing an appeal. See Lambert 
v. Lua, 92 Hawai 'i 228, 234, 990 P.2d 126, 132 (App. 1999). 
Therefore, Appellants are not entitled to appellate review of the 
Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession, or the District 
Court's pre-judgment orders, including the February 13, 2012 
2
 Appellants identified three points of error. However, based on
the arguments set forth in Appellants' briefs, the second and third point of
error both appear to seek appellate relief from the Order Denying Relief on
closely related, if not identical, grounds.

order granting summary judgment. See Cook v. Surety Life Ins. 
Co., 79 Hawai 'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) 
(addressing preliminary rulings). 
However, "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment 
relief under HRCP 60(b) is an appealable final order under HRS ยง 
641-1(a)." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai 'i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 974, 
981 (2003) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over Appellants' appeal as to the Order Denying Relief. 
Although failing to provide any citations to the
 
record, Appellants argue that their District Court Rules of Civil
 
Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60(b) motion should have been granted,
 
apparently because, in Appellants' view, the District Court's
 
commitment of the matter to circuit court for a jury trial did
 
not clearly specify that only Appellants' counterclaims and
 
third-party complaint were transferred and the Appellants had
 
intended to put title at issue in response to the Plaintiff's
 
claim for possession. At the hearing on the DCRCP Rule 60(b)
 
motion, however, the District Court stated that it was denying
 
Appellants' motion because the jury demand had only been approved
 
as to non-possession issues "as is typically the case" and good
 
cause had not been shown to grant Appellants' motion.
 
Moreover, the record demonstrates that Appellants 
failed to raise a valid title dispute as a defense to possession 
in this case. Under DCRCP Rule 12.1, defendants may raise a 
title dispute as a defense. DCRCP Rule 12.1 sets out 
requirements to prevent abuse of this defense. Deutsche Bank 
Nat'l Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai
'i 32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 
1132 (2011). Rule 12.1 requires a defendant to provide an 
affidavit stating the "source, nature and extent of the title 
claimed by defendant" and "further particulars as shall fully 
apprise the court of the nature of defendant's claim." DCRCP 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 12.1. (2012). The purpose of the affidavit is to provide 
the court with information to discern the interest claimed by the 
defendant. Peelua, 126 Hawai 'i at 37, 265 P.3d at 1133. Bare 
assertions are insufficient to sustain a claim that title is at issue so as to divest the District Court of jurisdiction. Id. at 
38, 265 P.3d at 1134. Here, Appellants failed to submit, at any time, a declaration providing the particulars about the source, 
nature or extent of their claim to title. Accordingly, the 
District Court did not err in entering the Order Denying Relief. 
For these reasons, the District Court's April 24, 2012
 
Order Denying Relief is affirmed.
