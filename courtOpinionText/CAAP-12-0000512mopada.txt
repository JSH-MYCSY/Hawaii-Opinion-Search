the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
The circuit court entered judgment in favor of
 
Defendant-Appellee The National Collegiate Athletic Association
 
(NCAA) and against Aloha consistent with the jury verdict finding
 
for the NCAA and interlocutory orders granted throughout the
 
proceedings.
 
On appeal Aloha contends the circuit court erred when
 
it:
 
(1) dismissed part of Aloha's claim brought under
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 480-2 (1993) (unfair competition
 
claim) on the grounds that it was barred by res judicata;
 
(2) dismissed part of Aloha's unfair competition claim
 
after finding Aloha lacked standing;
 
(3) dismissed part of Aloha's unfair competition claim
 
after finding it lacked a factual basis;
 
(4) admitted testimony from a NCAA witness despite
 
objection for impermissible conclusion;
 
(5) denied Aloha's motion for new trial under Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) and HRCP Rule 59, 
concluding that the newly submitted evidence would only serve to 
impeach or contradict a witness; and 
(6) awarded an excessive amount of attorneys' fees and
 
lacked jurisdiction to enter such award.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Aloha is a Hawai' i corporation and former bowl-
sponsoring agency that produced NCAA Division 1-A post-season 
football bowl games. The NCAA is an unincorporated voluntary 
association of approximately 1,200 colleges, universities, 
athletic conferences, and sports organizations that runs all 
business aspects of college sports, including certification of 
post-season football bowl games. 
2
 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided over the proceedings that
resulted in the aforementioned second, third and fourth orders, and entered
the judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
All NCAA affiliated post-season football bowl games
 
must be certified by the NCAA. To become certified, the bowl-
sponsoring agency must meet requirements set forth in the "NCAA
 
Postseason Football Handbook" (Handbook) released annually by the
 
NCAA. Before 2003, the Handbook required bowl-sponsoring
 
agencies, as a condition for certification, to agree to pay the
 
greater of 75% of gross receipts or $750,000 to teams competing
 
in the bowl game (Minimum Payout).
 
Aloha owned and operated the Aloha Bowl as an NCAA-
certified post-season football bowl game from 1982 to 2002. 
Aloha established the Oahu Bowl in 1998 as a double-header
 
package with the Aloha Bowl. To generate more revenue, Aloha
 
moved the Aloha Bowl to San Francisco, changed the name to the
 
San Francisco Bowl and scheduled the game for December 30, 2001.
 
Aloha also moved the Oahu Bowl to Seattle, changed the name to
 
the Seattle Bowl, and scheduled that game for January 2, 2002.
 
The NCAA withdrew certification of the Aloha Bowl/San
 
Francisco Bowl before the December 30, 2001 scheduled game. 
Aloha produced the Oahu Bowl/Seattle Bowl for the 2001 and 2002
 
seasons. Aloha entered into an agreement to transfer control of
 
Aloha to Pro Sports Entertainment, Inc. (Pro Sports) that was
 
terminated after the NCAA denied the Seattle Bowl's 2003
 
certification, citing substandard game conditions and failure to
 
meet Handbook requirements, including the Minimum Payout
 
obligation. 
On March 25, 2004, Aloha filed a complaint in the
 
3
United States District Court for the District of Hawaii  (federal
court). The parties engaged in extensive discovery. On June 1,
 2004, Aloha filed the "First Amended Complaint for Treble Damages
 
for Violations of: (1) Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15; (2)
 
Hawaii Unfair Trade Practices Law; (3) Breach of Contract; and
 
(4)
 Intentional Interference With Contract and/or Prospective
 
Economic Advantage" (Federal Complaint) in federal court.

 The Honorable David Alan Ezra presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On June 9, 2006, Aloha filed a motion to voluntarily 
dismiss the federal antitrust claim with prejudice and dismiss 
the Hawai' i state law claim without prejudice. On July 5, 2006, 
the federal court entered the "Order Provisionally Granting [Aloha's] Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Its First Cause of Action 
With Prejudice and Its Remaining Causes of Action Without 
Prejudice" (July Order), and on September 22, 2006 entered the 
"Order Dismissing [Aloha's] First Cause of Action (Violation of 
Sherman Act Section 1) With Prejudice and Its Remaining Causes of 
Action Without Prejudice." 
Aloha filed its complaint in the circuit court on
 
October 20, 2006; its "First Amended Complaint" on November 28,
 
2006; and its "Second Amended Complaint" on June 12, 2007.
 
Aloha's Second Amended Complaint brought claims against the NCAA
 
for: (1) unfair competition; (2) "Interference With Prospective
 
Economic Advantage"; (3) "Breach of Contract - Seattle Bowl" and,
 
(4) "Breach of Contract - Aloha Bowl." 
On August 15, 2007, the NCAA filed a motion to dismiss
 
Aloha's Second Amended Complaint With Prejudice. In the "Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part the [NCAA's] Motion to
 
Dismiss [Aloha's] Second Amended Complaint with Prejudice"
 
entered February 26, 2008, the circuit court took judicial notice
 
of the Federal Complaint and the July Order.
 
On May 27, 2011, Aloha filed its "Third Amended
 
Complaint", dropping the claim against the NCAA for breach of
 
contract regarding the Aloha Bowl. At the hearing held September
 
8, 2011, Aloha voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its remaining
 
claims against the NCAA for unfair competition and for breach of
 
contract regarding the Seattle Bowl. The only remaining
 
unresolved claim was for interference with prospective economic
 
advantage. On September 19, 2011 a jury returned a unanimous
 
verdict, finding Aloha did not prove its claim by a preponderance
 
of evidence.
 
On January 12, 2012, the circuit court entered a "Final
 
Judgment" in favor of the NCAA. On January 23, 2012, Aloha filed
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a motion to vacate the final judgment and for a new trial. On
 
January 31, 2012, the NCAA filed a motion for attorneys' fees and
 
costs. On May 8, 2012, the circuit court entered an order
 
denying Aloha's motion to vacate final judgment. On May 23,
 
2012, Aloha filed its notice of appeal. On June 19, 2012, the
 
circuit court entered an order granting in part and denying in
 
part the NCAA's motion for fees and costs (order granting fees).
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion to Dismiss
 
A trial court's grant or denial of a motion to dismiss
 
for "lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law,
 
reviewable de novo." Norris v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 74 Haw.
 
235, 239, 842 P.2d 634, 637 (1992), aff'd, Hawaiian Airlines,
 
Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 114 S. Ct. 2239 (1994). Norris
 
adopted the view of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Love v.
 
United States, 871 F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1989), opinion
 
amended on other grounds and superseded by Love v. United States,
 
915 F.2d 1242 (9th Cir. 1989), that:
 
review of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction is based on the contents of the complaint, the
allegations of which we accept as true and construe in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff. Dismissal is
 improper unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff
can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which
would entitle him to relief.
 
Norris, 74 Haw. at 240, 842 P.2d at 637 (internal quotation
 
marks, citation, and brackets omitted.) "However, when
 
considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to [HRCP] Rule 12(b)(1)
 
the trial court is not restricted to the face of the pleadings,
 
but may review any evidence, such as affidavits and testimony, to
 
resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of
 
jurisdiction." Norris, 74 Haw. at 240, 842 P.2d at 637 (internal
 
quotation marks, citation, and brackets in original omitted;
 bracketed material added).
 
B. Admission of Lay Opinion Testimony
 
"In Hawaii, admission of opinion evidence is a matter
 
within the discretion of the trial court, and only an abuse of
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that discretion can result in reversal." State v. Tucker, 10
 
Haw. App. 73, 89, 861 P.2d 37, 46 (1993) (reviewing for abuse of
 
discretion evidence admitted pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Evidence
 
(HRE) Rule 701).
 
C. Motion for New Trial
 
Under HRCP Rule 59(a) and Rule 60(b) "[b]oth the grant 
and the denial of a motion for new trial is within the trial 
court's discretion, and we will not reverse that decision absent 
a clear abuse of discretion." Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United 
Agri Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 259, 948 P.2d 1055, 1100 (1997) 
(internal quotation marks omitted); Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 428, 16 P.3d 827, 833 (App. 2000) ("It 
is well-settled that the trial court has a very large measure of discretion in passing upon motions under Rule 60(b) . . . ." 
(internal quotation marks omitted)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
(1) Aloha contends the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing part of the unfair competition claim as barred by res
 
judicata. The circuit court concluded that Aloha's claim against
 
the NCAA for unfair competition under HRS ยง 480-2 was previously
 
litigated in federal court under the Sherman Antitrust Act.
 
Res judicata, or claim preclusion, limits a party to 
one opportunity to litigate claims, preventing inconsistent 
results, multiplicity of suits, and promoting judicial economy 
and finality. Eastern Savings Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai' i 
154, 158, 296 P.3d 1062, 1066 (2013). Res judicata prohibits a party from bringing a new action in any court between the same 
parties, or their privies, regarding the same subject matter as 
claims that were previously litigated, or might have been 
properly litigated, in the previous action. Id. at 159, 296 P.3d 
at 1067. 
The preclusive effect of a prior federal adjudication
 
on a subsequent state action is a question of federal law, and as
 such, federal claim preclusion law applies. Wong v. Cayetano,
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
111 Hawai' i 462, 477, 143 P.3d 1, 16 (2006). "In federal court, 
there are three elements necessary to establish res judicata: (1) 
an identity of claims, (2) a final judgment on the merits, and 
(3) privity between the parties." Id. (internal quotation marks
 
omitted). 
For the first element, a claim in a subsequent suit is
 
identical to a claim in a prior adjudication when the two claims
 arise from "the same nucleus of operative facts," even if the
 
subsequent claim was not actually litigated in the previous suit.
 
Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional
 
Planning Agency, 322 F.3d 1064, 1077-78 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
In its Federal Complaint, Aloha brought an unfair
 
4
competition claim against the NCAA under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1  (Sherman
Act claim) alleging the NCAA: 
23. . . . by agreement of its member colleges and
universities engaged in a combination of conspiracy to fix the
minimum payout . . . to require a minimum payout of $750,000 or
75[%] of the gross revenues of the College Football Bowl Game,
whichever was greater. 
24. This combination and conspiracy, organized by and
through the NCAA, produced the following anticompetitive effects,
among others: 
a)
 competition in the amount, terms and
conditions of payouts . . . were artificially restricted;
and
 
b) bowl sponsoring agencies were deprived of the
benefits of competition as to the amount, terms and
conditions of payouts to NCAA member colleges and
universities in the United States.
 
Aloha subsequently moved for a voluntary dismissal of this claim
 
and the federal court granted the motion, dismissing the claim
 
with prejudice.
 
4
 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 provides: "Every contract, combination in the form
of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be
illegal."
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Aloha then brought an unfair competition claim under
 
5
HRS ยง 480-2  (HRS claim) in the circuit court alleging the NCAA:
20. . . . by agreement of its members colleges and
universities engaged in a combination and conspiracy to fix the
minimum payout amount . . . to require a minimum payout of
$750,000 or 75 percent of the gross revenues of each NCAA
Certified Postseason Football Bowl Game, whichever was greater. 
21. This combination and conspiracy, organized by and
through the NCAA, constituted unfair methods of competition
because:
 
(a) competition in the amount, terms and conditions of
payouts . . . was artificially restricted; and
 
(b) NCAA bowl sponsoring agencies were deprived of the
benefits of competition as to the amount, terms and conditions of
payouts to NCAA member colleges and universities in the United
States.
 
The Sherman Act claim and HRS claim both arise from the
 
same nucleus of operative facts. These claims, as the circuit
 
court found, were based on a conspiracy or combination to require
 
bowl-sponsoring agencies to comply with the Minimum Payout
 
obligation, which allegedly produced unfair methods of
 
competition. Moreover, the applicable federal and state laws are
 
effectively identical.6 All claims arising from an injury must
 
be raised in a single action or they will be barred by res
 judicata, even if some claims arise under state law and some
 
arise under federal law. See Silver v. Queen's Hospital, 63 Haw.
 
430, 437, 629 P.2d 1116, 1122 (1981). The claims are thus
 identical, satisfying the first element for res judicata. 
The second element for res judicata asks whether the
 
prior adjudication was a final judgment on the merits. The
 
5 HRS ยง 480-2(a) provides: "Unfair methods of competition and unfair
or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are
unlawful." 
6
 HRS ยง 480-2(b) specifies that interpretation of ยง 480-2 shall be
guided by the interpretation given by the Federal Trade Commission and federalcourts to Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. HRS ยง 480-2(b)(2008 Repl.). "Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, it is anunfair method of competition to violate any other specific trade regulationstatutes. Federal law also dictates that attempts to circumvent antitruststatutes are prohibited under the Act. Unfair trade practices which violatethe spirit of the antitrust laws fall within the purview of the Federal TradeCommission Act." Island Tobacco Co., v. R.J. Reynolds Indus., Inc., 513 F.
Supp. 726, 737 (D.C. Hawai' i 1981) (citation omitted). 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
federal court granted Aloha's motion to voluntarily dismiss the 
Sherman Act claim with prejudice. Under federal and Hawai' i law, 
a voluntary dismissal with prejudice constitutes a final judgment on the merits. See Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1506 (9th 
Cir. 1995); Matter of Herbert M. Dowsett Trust, 7 Haw. App. 640, 645, 791 P.2d 398, 402 (1990). As such, the voluntary dismissal 
of Aloha's Sherman Act claim constitutes a final judgment. 
The federal court's dismissal of Aloha's HRS claim without
 
prejudice is of no consequence. The HRS claim, even if raised in
 
state court for the first time, is barred by res judicata because
 
it is identical to the previously adjudicated Sherman Act claim. 
The third res judicata element is clearly satisfied.
 
The parties in both federal court and circuit court actions are
 
the same. Because the circuit court action raised identical
 
claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits between the
 
same parties, the circuit court did not err by finding Aloha's
 
unfair competition claims against NCAA were barred by res
 
judicata. 
(2) Aloha contends the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing part of its unfair competition claim against the NCAA
 
on grounds that Aloha lacked standing. In the Second Amended
 
Complaint, Aloha alleged the NCAA engaged in unfair competition
 
by denying the bid to re-certify the Aloha Bowl in 2002, in
 
violation of HRS ยง 480-2. Aloha failed to allege a specific date
 
for the NCAA's decision to deny certification. Before June 28,
 
2002, HRS ยง 480-2 did not provide a private right of action for
 
claims of unfair methods of competition.
7 Hawaii Medical Ass'n
 
v. Hawaii Medical Service Ass'n, Inc., 113 Hawai' i 77, 107, 148 
P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006). Thus, any claim brought by a person other 
than the Attorney General must allege unfair methods of 
competition after June 28, 2002. 
7
 HRS ยง 480-2 was amended to include the following language: "Any
person may bring an action based on unfair methods of competition declared
unlawful by this section." The approval date was June 28, 2002. 2002 Haw.
 Sess. Laws Act 229, ยง 2 at 917-18.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In this case, Aloha did not allege that the NCAA denied
 
certification of the Aloha Bowl after June 28, 2002. Aloha
 
alleged the NCAA withdrew certification of the Aloha Bowl before
 
the game could be played on December 30, 2001 and then denied the
 
application for re-certification in 2002. Therefore, the circuit
 
court did not err in concluding Aloha had no private right of
 
action and dismissing part of Aloha's claim for unfair
 
competition. 
(3) Aloha contends the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing part of its claim for failing to plead sufficient
 
facts. In the Second Amended Complaint, Aloha alleged the NCAA
 
engaged in unfair methods of competition by refusing to permit a
 
transfer of ownership of Aloha's NCAA certified post-season
 
football bowl games "without good cause." The circuit court
 
dismissed the claim "for lack of any factual basis within the
 
Second Amended Complaint."
 
In its opening brief, Aloha refers to allegations that
 
detail the impending sale and the alleged interference by the
 
NCAA. However, those allegations are not listed within the
 
"Unfair Competition" cause of action, but are instead included
 
within the "Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage"
 
cause of action which follows the unfair competition claim.
 
In considering a motion to dismiss, factual allegations
 
within the complaint are deemed true and viewed in light most
 
favorable to the plaintiff. Furthermore, he court is limited to
 
reviewing only the contents of the complaint. Kahala Royal Corp.
 
v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawai' i 251, 266, 151 
P.3d 732, 747 (2007). "Hawaii's rules of notice pleading require 
that a complaint set forth a short and plain statement of the 
claim that provides defendant with fair notice of what the 
plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests. 
Pleadings must be construed liberally." Tokuhisa v. Cutter Mgmt. 
Co., 122 Hawai' i 181, 192, 223 P.3d 246, 257 (App. 2009) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). "A complaint should not be 
dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of 
his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief." 
Pavsek v. Sandvold, 127 Hawai' i 390, 402-03, 279 P.3d 55, 67-68 
(App. 2012) (quoting In re Estate of Rogers, 103 Hawai' i 275, 
280, 81 P.3d 1190, 1195 (2003)). 
While the court must accept the allegations in the 
complaint as true, the court need not accept conclusory or 
formulaic recitations. See Pavsek, 127 Hawai' i at 403, 279 P.3d 
at 68. The factual allegations in a complaint need not be detailed to withstand a motion to dismiss, but they must raise 
the grounds for relief beyond the level of speculation. Id. The 
pleadings must be construed to do substantial justice, allowing the plaintiff to plead claims lacking legal precision so long as 
the complaint provides the defendant with adequate notice as to 
the claim and grounds. Tokuhisa, 122 Hawai' i at 192, 223 P.3d at 
257. "[T]he Hawai' i Supreme Court has rejected the approach that 
pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may 
be decisive to the outcome and in turn accepted the principle 
that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision 
on the merits." Id. (quoting Hall v. Kim, 53 Haw. 215, 221, 491 
P.2d 541, 545 (1971)). 
In an unfair competition claim, the plaintiff must 
sufficiently allege the unfair act or practice and the nature of the competition. 
Hawai'i Medical Ass'n,  113 Hawai' i at 111, 148 
P.3d at 1213. Notice pleading required Aloha to plead facts that show the NCAA engaged in an unfair act or practice to compete 
with Aloha for a transaction with Pro Sports when it de-certified 
the Seattle Bowl. 
Aloha alleged the NCAA knew about the pending sale to
 
Pro Sports and the significance of certification to the pending
 
transaction. 
Aloha further alleged the NCAA disrupted the
 
transaction by encouraging Pro Sports to abandon the deal with
 Aloha and apply for a bowl game independent of Aloha. These
 
alleged facts are sufficient to discern Aloha's claim that the
 
NCAA employed an unfair method of de-certification to gain an
 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
advantage in the competition with Aloha to obtain a deal with Pro
 
Sports. 
When read as a whole, Aloha's Second Amended Complaint
 
provides a factual basis for Aloha's claim that de-certification
 
was an unfair method of competition in the Pro Sports
 
transaction. Reviewing the motion to dismiss in light most
 
favorable to Aloha, and accepting all factual allegations as
 
true, the circuit court erred in dismissing Aloha's claim for
 
lack of factual basis.
 
(4) Aloha contends the circuit court erred in admitting
 
testimony from a witness called by the NCAA over Aloha's
 
objection. During the jury trial, the NCAA called the NCAA Post-
Season Football Certification Committee Chairman Tim Curley
 
(Curley) as a witness to testify about his involvement with the
 
certification of the Aloha Bowl and the Oahu Bowl. During his
 
testimony, the following exchange occurred:
 
[NCAA counsel]: Did you and the committee and the staff of
the NCAA treat [Plaintiff] fairly in connection with their
attempt to get the San Francisco Bowl going?
 
[Curley]:  
Absolutely.
 
[NCAA counsel]: 
Was there ever any doubt in your mind that
they got a fair shake and then some?
 
[Curley]:  
No sir.
 
[NCAA counsel]: 
What about with the Seattle Bowl; did you
treat them fairly?
 
[Curley]:  
I believe so.
 
Aloha objected to Curley's testimony as an "impermissible
 
conclusion" that "invades the province of the jury." The circuit
 
court allowed the opinion. 
Under Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 701 (1993) 
If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the
witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is
limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1)
rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (2)
helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony
or determination of a fact in issue.
 
The witness' opinion may discuss a fact at issue without invading
 
the province of the jury where the jury has great latitude to
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determine the issue. Bachran v. Morishige, 52 Haw. 61, 68, 469 
P.2d 808, 812 (1970). Lay opinion testimony can be considered 
speculative when the opinion is not based on first-hand 
knowledge. American Broadcasting Companies v. Kenai Air of 
Hawai'i, Inc., 67 Haw. 219, 230, 686 P.2d 1, 8 (1984). Opinion 
testimony must not state conclusions of law, and thus invade the 
province of the court. Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel, 112 Hawai' i 
3, 15, 143 P.3d 1205, 1217 (2006). 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by
 
allowing the opinion testimony because Curley testified from
 first-hand knowledge of observed facts and the opinion was
 
helpful to the jury's understanding of the committee process. 
Based on his experience during the Aloha Bowl certification
 
process, Curley opined about the committee's treatment of Aloha
 
during the re-certification process for the Aloha/San Francisco
 
Bowl in April 2001. The jury had great latitude in determining
 
whether the NCAA engaged in unfair competition. Curley's
 
testimony was not an impermissible conclusion and did not invade
 
the province of the jury.
 
(5) Aloha contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in denying the motion for new trial because new
 
evidence allegedly showed Curley misrepresented facts during his
 
testimony. At the time of Curley's testimony, Curley was the
 
Athletic Director for Penn State. During introductory questions
 
posed to Curley, the following exchange occurred:
 
[NCAA Counsel]: How's Coach Paterno?
 
[Curley]: 
He's doing well, he's doing well.
 
Aloha's motion for a new trial was based on this exchange, where
 Aloha alleged Curley made a false statement that prevented Aloha
 
from presenting its case to the jury.
 
In support of its motion to vacate the final judgment,
 
Aloha offered evidence showing Curley knew Coach Paterno was not
 
doing well due to a major scandal at Penn State. Aloha also
 
offered evidence of a criminal complaint against Curley for
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
perjury in connection with the Penn State scandal. Aloha
 
maintained the evidence of perjury would likely change the
 
outcome under HRCP Rule 59(a) and the statement about Paterno
 
constituted fraud under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3). The circuit court
 
denied the motion for new trial on the basis the new evidence was
 
not material and controlling so as to change the outcome.
 
HRCP Rule 59(a) provides: "[a] new trial may be 
granted . . . on all or part of the issues . . . in an action in 
which there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for 
which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law 
in the courts of the State[.]" A trial court's decision to grant 
or deny a motion for new trial remains undisturbed absent a clear 
abuse of discretion. Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai' i at 259, 948 P.2d 
at 1100. A trial court may grant a motion for new trial when the newly discovered evidence: (1) was previously undiscovered 
despite the exercise of due diligence; (2) is admissible and 
credible; and (3) is "of such a material and controlling nature 
as will probably change the outcome and not merely cumulative or 
tending only to impeach or contradict a witness." Orso v. City & 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 56 Haw. 241, 250, 534 P.2d 489, 494 (1975) 
overruled on other grounds by Kahale v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 
104 Hawai' i 341, 90.3d 233 (2004). 
The Penn State scandal bore no relevance to the
 
instant case and evidence from that scandal was neither material
 
nor controlling in this present matter. Evidence of a criminal
 
complaint against Curley alleging perjury in an unrelated action
 
serves only to impeach Curley's credibility. Therefore, the
 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it found the
 
evidence submitted by Aloha failed the Orso test. 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) provides: "the court may relieve a
 
party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the
 
following reasons: . . . (3) fraud (whether heretofore
 
denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or
 
misconduct of an adverse party[.]" Fraud is "that which
 
seriously affects the integrity of the normal process of

adjudication" and includes bribery of judges and jury tampering. 
Moyle v. Y & Y Hyup Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai' i 385, 403, 191 P.3d 
1062, 1080 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). To prevail on a motion under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3), the movant must: "(1) prove 
by clear and convincing evidence that the verdict was obtained 
through fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct, and (2) 
establish that the conduct complained of prevented the losing 
party from fully and fairly presenting his case or defense." 
Kawamata Farms, Inc., 86 Hawai' i at 255, 948 P.2d at 1096 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Jones v. Aero/Chem Corp., 921 F.2d 875, 878-79 (9th Cir. 1990)). 
Aloha attempts to characterize Curley's statement that 
Paterno "is doing well" as a fraudulent misrepresentation since 
Curley knew the potential impact of the Penn State scandal on 
Paterno. Aloha failed to show how this statement constitutes a 
misrepresentation used to obtain a judgment. Nor did Aloha 
successfully demonstrate how the statement interfered with 
Aloha's ability to present its case to the jury. Even if the 
statement were to be construed as perjury, perjury alone does not 
constitute fraud under HRCP Rule 60(b)(3). Cvitanovich-Dubie v. 
Dubie, 125 Hawai' i 128, 145, 254 P.3d 439, 456 (2011); See Moyle, 
118 Hawai' i at 403, 191 P.3d at 1080. Therefore, the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion in denying Aloha's motion for new trial. 
(6) Aloha contends the circuit court lacked 
jurisdiction to enter an award of attorneys' fees. Aloha 
provided no argument for this alleged error and "[p]oints not 
argued may be deemed waived." Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b)(7). However, based on our review of the record we conclude the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enter 
the award for attorneys' fees.
 "While a case is on appeal, the lower court lacks 
jurisdiction to decide any questions pertaining to attorney fees 
arising out of or relating to the matter on appeal." Wong v. 
Wong, 87 Hawai' i 475, 486, 960 P.2d 145, 156 (App. 1998). Aloha

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed its notice of appeal on May 23, 2012. The circuit court
 
entered its order granting fees on June 19, 2012.
