APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 08-1-0996-05 & 08-1-1280-06)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Plaintiffs/
 
Appellants Kimberly Ann Eiko Lee and Daniel Morris Lee's (the Lee
 
Appellants) appeal from the Honorable Rom A. Trader's April 25,
 
2012 judgment in the consolidated cases of Civil No. 08-1-0996-05 
and Civil No. 08-1-1280-06, because the April 25, 2012 judgment
 
does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final
 
judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 &
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Supp. 2011), Rules 54(b) and 58 of the Hawaif i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaif i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the 
Supreme Court of Hawaif i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the 
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
fi at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all 
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawaif i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does 
not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties 
or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP 
[Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawaif i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
The finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b) requires "an express determination that there is no just reason 
for delay . . . for the entry of judgment." HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Therefore, when a party seeks appellate review of an order that 
adjudicates one or more but fewer than all of the claims, the 
"party cannot appeal from [the] circuit court order even though 
the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; 
the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) 
certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer 
v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawaif i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239

(1994) (emphasis added). For example, "a judgment or order in a 
consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all 
parties, is not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) 
certification." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 109 Hawaif i 8, 13, 
122 P.3d 803, 808 (2005). 
The April 25, 2012 judgment is a judgment in a
 
consolidated case that purports to dispose of fewer than all
 claims among all parties. The April 25, 2012 judgment enters
 
judgment in favor of Plaintiff/Defendant/Appellee Betsy Akiko
 
Morioka (Appellee Morioka) and against the Lee Appellants as to 
(a) Appellee Morioka's complaint for partition in
Civil No. 08-1-0996-05, and
 
(b) Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the Lee
Appellants' amended complaint in Civil No. 08-1­1280-06.
 
However, the April 25, 2012 judgment does not resolve all of the
 
claims against all parties in the consolidated cases. For
 
example, the April 25, 2012 judgment does not resolve Appellee
 
Morioka's complaint for partition in Civil No. 08-1-0996-05 as to
 
Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellees Hawaii State Federal
 
Credit Union or the City and County of Honolulu Department of
 
Budget and Fiscal Services, nor does the April 25, 2012 judgment
 
resolve the Lee Appellants' cross-claims. The April 25, 2012
 
judgment also does not resolve Count 5 and Count 9 of the Lee
 
Appellants' amended complaint in Civil No. 08-1-1280-06. Most
 
significantly, however, although the April 25, 2012 judgment does
 
not resolve all claims in the consolidated cases, the April 25,
 
2012 judgment does not contain "an express determination that
 
there is no just reason for delay . . . for the entry of
 
judgment[,]" as HRAP Rule 54(b) requires for the certification
 
that is necessary to appeal from a judgment on one or more but
 
fewer than all claims or parties. Therefore, the April 25, 2012
 
judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable

judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and
 
the holding in Jenkins.
 
Absent an appealable judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction and the Lee Appellants' appeal is premature. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-12-0000513 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
