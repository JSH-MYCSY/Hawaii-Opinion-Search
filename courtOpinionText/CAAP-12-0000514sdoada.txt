 granted the State's motion to amend the
original complaint to allege the required mens rea of

After a bench trial, Hardoby was found guilty of
 
OVLPSR-OVUII. The District Court sentenced Hardoby to thirty
 
days in jail, imposed a $500 fine and other fees and assessments,
 and revoked his driver's license for one year from the date of
 his release from confinement. The District Court entered its
 Judgment on April 27, 2012, and this appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Hardoby contends: (1) the original complaint
 
was defective for failing to allege the requisite mens rea and
 the District Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the State's
 motion to amend the original complaint to cure this defect; (2)
 the District Court violated his right of confrontation in
 admitting the portion of Exhibit 2 consisting of a letter signed
 by Beverly J. Bose, a custodian of government driving and
 licensing records, and it also erred in admitting the remainder
 of Exhibit 2 consisting of a certified copy of a printout of
 Hardoby's driving records; and (3) there was insufficient
 evidence that Hardoby had notice that his license had previously
 been revoked for operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant (OVUII) to support his conviction. As explained
 below, we affirm Hardoby's conviction. 
I.
 
At trial, Maui Police Department Officer Nephi Laga
 
(Officer Laga) testified that on December 11, 2011, he stopped a
 vehicle Hardoby was driving because the license plate was
 unreadable. Officer Laga asked Hardoby for his driver's license. 
Hardoby was unable to provide a driver's license but provided
 
Officer Laga with his name and date of birth, which the officer
 recited in court. Officer Laga contacted central dispatch with
 this information and learned that Hardoby's license had been
 revoked. Officer Laga then cited Hardoby for driving while his
 license was revoked.

did not allege the requisite mens rea as the "original complaint"
and the complaint amended to include the requisite mens rea as
the "amended complaint."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
At trial, the District Court admitted Exhibits 1 and 2
 
offered by the State. Exhibit 1 is a certified copy of the
 
Judgment filed by the District Court on July 18, 2011, in State
 v. Stacy Hardoby, Case No. 2DTA-11-00674, which shows that the
 defendant was present in court, was convicted of OVUII for
 violating HRS ยง 291E-61(a), and was sentenced to driver's license
 revocation for one year effective immediately. Exhibit 2
 consists of: (1) a letter signed by Beverly J. Bose (Bose
 Letter), Custodian of Public Records of the Department of
 Finance, Motor Vehicles and Licensing Division, County of Maui,
 in which Bose certifies that based on research "prepared with
 information taken from a subpoena or memorandum issued to our
 department from the MAUI COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE," the
 defendant's driver's license records show an active revocation
 from August 18, 2011, to August 17, 2012, and a suspension from
 July 18, 2011, to July 17, 2012; and (2) a seven-page printout of
 Hardoby's driving records, with each page of the printout
 containing a verification by Bose that the record is a true and
 correct copy of official records, including data compilations, of
 the Motor Vehicles and Licensing Division of the Department of
 Finance.
 
The District Court admitted Exhibit 1 without objection
 
from Hardoby. The District Court admitted Exhibit 2 over
 Hardoby's objection on confrontation clause and hearsay grounds. 
At the conclusion of trial, the District Court found Hardoby
 guilty of OVLPSR-OVUII.
 
II.
 
We resolve the arguments Hardoby raises on appeal as
 
follows:
 
A.
 
There is no dispute that the original complaint against 
Hardoby was defective for failing to allege the requisite intentional, knowing, or reckless mens rea. However, in State v. Kam, 134 Hawai
'i 280, 286, 339 P.3d 1081, 1087 (2014), we held 
that there was no jurisdictional impediment to the trial court's 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
permitting the State to cure this same defect by filing an
 
amended complaint that alleged the requisite mens rea. Based on
 Kam, we reject Hardoby's claim that the District Court lacked
 jurisdiction to grant the State's motion to amend the original
 complaint to allege the requisite mens rea. Hardoby does not
 raise any other ground to challenge the District Court's ruling. 
We conclude that the District Court properly permitted the State
 to amend the original complaint.
 
B.
 
Hardoby argues that the portion of Exhibit 2 that 
consists of the Bose Letter is testimonial and that based on Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), the admission of the letter in lieu of testimony by its author violated his confrontation rights. In State v. Souleng, --- P.3d ---, No. CAAP-12-0000196, 2015 WL 291341, at *4, 6-7 (Hawai
'i 
App. Jan. 22, 2015), we concluded that the introduction of a similar letter under similar circumstances violated the defendant's confrontation rights. Based on Souleng, we conclude that the admission of the Bose Letter was improper and violated Hardoby's confrontation rights.
4 
The remainder of Exhibit 2 consists of a seven-page
 
printout of Hardoby's driving records. Hardoby does not contend
 that the printout of his driving records is testimonial. He also
 acknowledges that the printout could constitute a self-
authenticating document, but contends that the printout was
 
4The State cites this court's Memorandum Opinion in State v.
Bailey, No. 29558, 2011 WL 5821889 (Hawai 'i App. Nov. 18, 2011),
in support of its argument that Exhibit 2, including the Bose
Letter, was properly admitted. In Bailey, we held that the trialcourt did not commit plain error in admitting an exhibit similarto Exhibit 2. Bailey, 2011 WL 5821889, at *3-5. However, in
Bailey, we did not address any challenge to the admission of theexhibit on confrontation clause grounds because we concluded thatBailey had waived any confrontation clause claim by failing toraise it in the trial court or in his points of error on appeal.Id. at *5 n.8. Thus, Bailey does not provide any persuasiveauthority regarding Hardoby's confrontation claim.

somehow tainted by the Bose Letter.
 
Each page of the printout of Hardoby's driving records
 
contains the following verification:
 
I, Beverly J. Bose, Custodian of Public Records of the
Department of Finance, Motor Vehicles & Licensing Division,
do hereby verify that this is a full, true and correct copy
of all official records or reports or entries therein, or of
documents authorized by law to be recorded or filed and
actually recorded or filed, including data compilations in
any form with the Motor Vehicles & Licensing Division of the
Department of Finance with respect to Hawaii State License.
 
Accordingly, the authentication of the printout of Hardoby's
 
driving records does not depend on, and is not tainted by, the
 Bose Letter.
 
We conclude that the certified copy of the printout of
 
Hardoby's driving records is not testimonial. See State v. Cady,
 
425 S.W.3d 234, 245-47 (Mo. Ct. App. 2014) (holding that printout
 of information contained in national computerized database
 regarding defendant's purchases and attempted purchases of
 pseudoephedrine is not testimonial). Unlike the Bose Letter,
 which was prepared specifically for use at Hardoby's trial and
 created for the sole purpose of proving an essential element of
 Hardoby's charged offense, Hardoby's driving records are records
 that are created and used for purposes separate and independent
 from prosecution or proving some fact at trial. In addition,
 unlike the Bose Letter, which sets forth Bose's interpretation of
 what Hardoby's driving records show, the printout of Hardoby's
 driving records do not contain any testimonial interpretation by
 Bose of what the records show. Accordingly, the printout of
 Hardoby's driving records is not testimonial, and its
 introduction in evidence did not require that Bose be called as a
 witness and be subject to cross-examination under Melendez-Diaz. 
See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 322-24; Cady, 425 S.W.3d at 245ยญ47.
 
We further conclude that the printout fell within the
 
hearsay exception for public records and reports and was properly
 self-authenticated. See Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
803(b)(8) (1993); HRE Rule 902(4) (Supp. 2014); Bailey, 2011 WL
 
5821889, at *3-5. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in
 admitting the portion of Exhibit 2 consisting of the printout.
 
C.
 
We reject Hardoby's contention that there was
 
insufficient evidence that Hardoby had notice that his license
 had previously been revoked for OVUII to support his conviction. 
The State was only required to prove that Hardoby had a reckless
 state of mind regarding whether his license remained revoked for
 OVUII on December 11, 2011, the date of the charged OVLPSR-OVUII
 offense.
 
The State, without objection, introduced Exhibit 1, a 
certified copy of the Judgment filed by the District Court on July 18, 2011, in State v. Stacy Hardoby, Case No. 2DTA-11-00674 (2DTA-11-00674 Judgment). The 2DTA-11-00674 Judgment shows that the defendant (with the same name as Hardoby) was present in court, was convicted of OVUII for violating HRS ยง 291E-61(a), and was sentenced to driver's license revocation for one year effective immediately. The State introduced additional evidence showing that the 2DTA-11-00674 Judgment pertained to Hardoby, in that the same case number and sentence were referenced in the printout of Hardoby's driving records, which also contained Hardoby's birth date (which matched the birth date for Hardoby recited by Officer Laga at trial) and Hardoby's physical description (which the District Court could compare with Hardoby's appearance in court for trial). We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove that Hardoby acted with a reckless state of mind in driving while his license remained suspended or revoked for OVUII. See State v. Pantoja, 
89 Hawai
'i 492, 495-96, 974 P.2d 1082, 1085-86 (App. 1999); State 
v. Davis, 133 Hawai 'i 102, 122, 324 P.3d 912, 932 (2014); State 
v. Lioen, 106 Hawai 'i 123, 130-32, 102 P.3d 367, 374-76 (App. 
2004).

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District
