APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0455(1))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Pro Se Defendant-Appellant Jay F. Reyes (Reyes) appeals
 
from the "Final Judgment In Favor Of Plaintiff Mary Jo Frye"
 
(Final Judgment) entered April 26, 2012 in the Circuit Court of
 
1
the Second Circuit  (circuit court).  The circuit court entered
 
the Final Judgment consistent with the "Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion For Summary Judgment" entered November 14,
 
2011, and decreed Plaintiff-Appellee Mary Jo Frye (Frye) to be
 
the sole and exclusive owner of a contested parcel of land.

 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Frye's
 
appeal is without merit. 
The circuit court granted summary judgment against
 
Reyes on the basis of collateral estoppel.
 
Collateral estoppel, "applies to a subsequent suit 
between the parties or their privies on a different cause of 
action and prevents the parties or their privies from 
relitigating any issue that was actually litigated and finally 
decided in the earlier action." Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 
116 Hawai' i 239, 264, 172 P.3d 983, 1008 (2007) (quoting Dorrance 
v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 143, 148, 976 P.2d 904, 909 (1999)). 
[T]he doctrine of collateral estoppel bars relitigation of
an issue where: (1) the issue decided in the prior
adjudication is identical to the one presented in the action
in question; (2) there is a final judgment on the merits;
(3) the issue decided in the prior adjudication was
essential to the final judgment; and (4) the party against
whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in
privity with a party to the prior adjudication.
 
Dorrance, 90 Hawai' i at 149, 976 P.2d at 910. This four-part 
test provides guidance to ensure that the purpose of the 
doctrine, to promote judicial economy and consistency, does not 
interfere with a party's opportunity to fully litigate his 
claims. See Isobe v. Sakatani, 127 Hawai' i 368, 376-77, 279 P.3d 
33, 41-42 (App. 2012). 
As to the first element in the collateral estoppel
 
test, the issue decided in Hartley v. Heirs of Aki, a civil
 action under Civil No. 07-1-0456, is identical to the issue
 
presented in this case. Hartley, was a quiet title action for
 
land situated on Apana 1 and Apana 2. Reyes, a party in that
 case as well, raised the issue of whether the heirs of W.L.
 
Puleloa, including himself, held any interest in Apana 1 and
 
Apana 2. The circuit court made, in part, the following Findings
 
of Fact:
 
2
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
59. The Puleloa Defendants failed to prove that they
own any interest in those portions of Apana 1 and/or Apana 2
that are contained within TMK Parcel No. (2) 2-2-05-03.
 
60. The Puleloa Defendants did not prove by a
preponderance of the evidence the genealogy, paper title, or
intestate succession necessary to establish the interest
they claim in those portions of Apana 1 and/or Apana 2 that
are contained within TMK Parcel No. (2) 2-2-05-03 and are
the subject of this litigation. 
.   ..
 
69. None of the heirs of W.L. Puleloa used Apana 1 or
Apana 2 after 1938.
 
70. None of the heirs of W.L. Puleloa paid real
property taxes on Apana 1 or Apana 2 after 1938.
 
71. None of the heirs of W.L. Puleloa made a deed to
 
Apana 1 or Apana 2 after 1938.
 
72. None of the heirs of W.L. Puleloa had a probate
proceeding in which Apana 1 or Apana 2 were listed in the
inventory after 1938.
 
.  .  .
 
74. Kaonoulu Ranch and other predecessors in title to
Plaintiff Joseph Wayman Hartley III had no reason to know
that any heirs of W.L. Puleloa or Alana claimed to own any
interest in Apana 1 or Apana 2. 
The circuit court found that neither Reyes, nor any other heir of
 
W.L. Puleloa, held any interest in Apana 1 or Apana 2.
 
In this case, Reyes once again asks the circuit court
 
to determine whether Reyes or any other heir of W.L. Puleloa
 
holds any interest in land situated within Apana 2. The circuit
 
court in Hartley rendered a decision on this identical issue of
 
ownership interest of Apana 2. Therefore, the first element of
 
the collateral estoppel test is satisfied. 
As to second element of the collateral estoppel test,
 
the Final Hartley Judgment entered November 10, 2010 in the
 
circuit court qualifies as a final judgment on the merits of all
 
claims in the case. Since Reyes did not appeal the Hartley
 
Judgment, the decision was final as to Reyes.
 
As to the third element of the collateral estoppel
 
test, the issue of ownership rights adjudicated in Hartley was
 
essential to the final judgment in that case. The Hartley
 
3
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment decreed Hartley to be the "sole and exclusive owner
 
of . . . portions of . . . Apana 1 and Apana 2." The decision in
 
Hartley was rendered after evaluating claims of interest in Apana
 
2 asserted by Reyes and heirs of W.L. Puleloa.
 
The fourth and final element of the collateral estoppel 
test is satisfied in that Reyes was a party in Hartley. Exotics 
Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 104 Hawai' i 
358, 365-66, 90 P.3d 250, 257-58 (2004). 
Given that the collateral estoppel test was satisfied
 
in this case, the circuit court did not err in granting summary
 
judgment.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Final Judgment In Favor
 
Of Plaintiff Mary Jo Frye" entered April 26, 2012 in the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 31, 2013.
