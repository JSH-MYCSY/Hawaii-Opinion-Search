APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD

ORDER GRANTING THE AUGUST 3, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the August 3, 2012 motion by
 
Employer/Appellee/Appellee State of Hawai' i Department of 
Transportation (Appellee State Department of Transportation) to
 
dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 (2) Claimant/Appellant/Appellant Alan Vidal's (Appellant Vidal)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
August 9, 2012 memorandum in opposition to Appellee State
 
Department of Transportation's August 3, 2012 motion to dismiss
 this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and (3) the
 record, it appears that Appellee State Department of
 Transportation's August 3, 2012 motion to dismiss this appeal for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction has merit, because Appellant Vidal
 is appealing from a May 2, 2012 decision and order by the Labor
 
1
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (the LIRAB)  that does not
adjudicate all of the issues and end the proceedings in the
 administrative appeal for Appellant Vidal's workers' compensation
 claims that is still pending before the LIRAB in Case No. AB
 2009-036.
 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
 
2 3
(Supp. 2011)  and HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011),  an
 
aggrieved party may appeal a final decision and order by the
 LIRAB directly to the intermediate court of appeals:
 
1
 On May 2, 2012, the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
(the LIRAB) was composed of Chairperson Roland Q.F. Thom, Member Melanie S.
Matsui, and Member David A. Pendleton.

 "The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final and
conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless within thirty days
after mailing of a certified copy of the decision or order, the director or
any other party appeals to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate board."
HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2011) (in relevant part).

 HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) provides:
 
§ 91-14. Judicial review of contested cases.
 (a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a
contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief is entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter; but
nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of
review, redress, relief, or trial de novo, including the right of trial by
jury, provided by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to
the contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term "person aggrieved"
shall include an agency that is a party to a contested case proceeding before
that agency or another agency.

The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citations and some 
internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The LIRAB's May 2, 2012 decision and order adjudicated only one of the two issues before the LIRAB in this matter. The May 2, 2012 decision and order did not end the proceedings before the LIRAB, and it did not leave nothing further to be accomplished. According to the record on appeal, the LIRAB has yet to enter a final order that adjudicates the remaining issue that the LIRAB will adjudicate in Appellant Vidal's appeal before the LIRAB, namely, whether the Director erred in his January 26, 2009 supplemental decision by denying Appellant Vidal’s request for reimbursement of a no-show fee that a physician assessed against Appellant Vidal. Therefore, the May 2, 2012 decision and order is not an appealable order under HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a). Although exceptions to the final order requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the May 2, 2012 decision and order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay

doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). Absent an appealable decision and order by the LIRAB, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee State Department of
 
Transportation's August 3, 2012 motion to dismiss this appeal for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court
 case number CAAP-12-0000522 is dismissed.
