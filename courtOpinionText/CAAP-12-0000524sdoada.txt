SAMSON OKAPUA KAMAKEA, SR., and TALIA POMAIKAI KAMAKEA,
Defendants-Appellants, and JOHN DOES 1-10;

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(HILO DIVISION)
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0234)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Samson Okapua Kamakea, Sr., and
 
Talia Pomaikai Kamakea (the Kamakeas) appeal from the February
 
28, 2012 Judgment Re: Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 
Order Granting Plaintiff's Summary Judgment as to All Claims and
 
All Parties, Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of
 
Sale (Judgment) entered against them and in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee First Hawaiian Bank by the Circuit Court of the Third
 
Circuit, Hilo Division (Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, the Kamakeas raise a single point of error, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in denying their Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(1) motion, which was based on 
the assertion that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction over the

foreclosure proceedings because the Kamakeas are citizens of the
 
Hawaiian Kingdom.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that claims
 
involving the applicability of the Kingdom of Hawai' i laws are 
without merit. The Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013), recently reaffirmed 
this principle:
 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the court's
jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the Kingdomgovernment. In that regard, we reaffirm that "[w]hatever maybe said regarding the lawfulness" of its origins, "the Stateof Hawai' i . . . is now a lawful government." State v. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664
(App.2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004).
Individuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and notof the State are not exempt from application of the State'slaws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State v. Lorenzo, 77 
Hawai'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State v. French, 77 
Hawai'i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994); Nishitani v. Baker,
82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App. 1996); State v. Lee, 90 
Hawai'i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's February 28, 2012
 
Judgment is affirmed.
