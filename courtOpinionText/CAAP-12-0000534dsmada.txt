Upon review of (1) Petitioner-Appellant Dana Borges
 
Rapozo's (Appellant Rapozo) August 8, 2012 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000534 for lack of

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wilson's April 26, 2012 "Order Denying Petition, in Part, and 
Granting an Evident[i]ary Hearing Regarding Young Adult Defendant Sentencing, and Appointing Counsel" (the April 26, 2012 order), because the April 26, 2012 order is not an appealable judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), Rule 40(h) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP), and the holding in Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai' i 10, 
13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2011) and "HRPP [Rule] 
40(h), appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori, 79 Hawai' i at 13, 897 P.2d at 
940 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet
 
entered a final judgment that resolves all of the issues in
 Appellant Rapozo's HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction
 relief in S.P.P. No. 10-1-0064. The April 26, 2012 order
 resolves some, but not all, of the issues in Appellant Rapozo's
 HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief. Therefore,
 Appellant Rapozo's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000534. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Rapozo's August 8,
 
2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12­0000534 is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-12­0000534 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction without

prejudice to Appellant Rapozo asserting a timely appeal from a
 
future final judgment that resolves all the remaining issues in
 Appellant Rapozo's HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction
 relief in S.P.P. No. 10-1-0064.
