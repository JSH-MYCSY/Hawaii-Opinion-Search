1
Circuit  (circuit court) in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Mathew S.
Mikelson (Mikelson).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
The background facts of this case are set forth in 
Mikelson v. United Services Auto. Ass'n, 107 Hawai fi 192, 111 
P.3d 601 (2005) (Mikelson I), Mikelson v. United Services Auto. Ass'n, 108 Hawai
fi 358, 120 P.3d 257 (2005) (Mikelson II), and 
Mikelson v. United Services Auto. Ass'n, 122 Hawai fi 393, 227 
P.3d 559 (App. 2010) (Mikelson III). The current appeal involves 
a dispute regarding the circuit court's award of attorneys' fees 
and costs in Mikelson's favor. 
On January 23, 2001, Mikelson filed an amended 
complaint alleging claims for declaratory relief (Count I) and 
for bad faith and punitive damages (Counts II and III) against 
USAA. Following a bench trial, the circuit court ruled in 
Mikelson's favor on his declaratory relief claim, concluding 
Mikelson was a covered person under an insurance policy issued by 
USAA and entering a judgment certified pursuant to Hawai fi Rules 
of Civil Procedure Rule 54(b). In Mikelson I, the Hawai fi 
Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. 107 Hawai fi 
at 201-06, 111 P.3d at 610-15. In Mikelson II, the supreme court denied Mikelson's request for attorneys' fees. 108 Hawai
fi at 
361, 120 P.3d at 260. 
Pursuant to the insurance policy, and as directed by
 
the supreme court in Mikelson II, the parties entered into
 arbitration to determine the amount of benefits to which Mikelson
 
was entitled. On October 4, 2006, the arbitrator awarded
 
Mikelson a net amount of $110,236.33. USAA tendered a check for
 
the full amount of benefits on October 10, 2006, six days after
 
the award's issuance.
 
Mikelson filed his "Motion for Order Confirming the
 
Arbitration Award" on October 17, 2006 and his "Motion for Order

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided over the Order to Pay
Benefits; the Honorable Patrick W. Border presided over the Order Granting
Attorneys' Fees and Costs and the Final Judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that Defendant [USAA] 'Pay Benefits' to Plaintiff" on October 20,
 
2006. The circuit court granted both motions.
 
On July 13, 2007, the parties stipulated to dismiss the
 
remaining Counts II and III and to bear their own attorneys' fees
 
and costs relating to Counts II and III. The parties further
 
stipulated the dismissal would not occur "until after all
 
proceedings related to [Mikelson's] anticipated Motion for
 
Attorney Fees and Costs [was] fully and finally adjudicated by
 
the circuit court." Mikelson reserved the right to move for
 
attorneys' fees "including but not limited to an award under
 
[HRS] § 431:10-242."
 
On December 26, 2006, USAA appealed the circuit court's 
order confirming the arbitration award, and this court affirmed 
the order on March 24, 2010 in Mikelson III. 122 Hawai fi at 
399-401, 227 P.3d at 565-67. After issuing our opinion in Mikelson III, this court also entered an order on June 8, 2010, 
denying Mikelson's request for attorneys' fees. 
On November 22, 2010, Mikelson filed a "Renewed Motion
 
for Attorney Fees and Costs Under [HRS] § 431:10-242" in the
 
circuit court. On May 3, 2012, the circuit court entered its
 
Order Granting Attorneys' Fees and Costs and its Final Judgment. 
USAA timely appealed on May 31, 2012.
 
On appeal, USAA contends the circuit court erred as a
 
matter of law in entering its (1) Order to Pay Benefits and (2)
 
Order Granting Attorneys' Fees and Costs.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
[The appellate] court reviews the denial and granting
of attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard.
The same standard applies to [the appellate] court's review
of the amount of a trial court's award of attorney's fees.
An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant.

quotation marks, citations, brackets in original, and ellipses

State of Hawai fi, 92 Hawai fi 432, 439, 992 P.2d 127, 134 (2000)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Order To Pay Benefits
 
The sole issue in this appeal concerns Mikelson's
 
entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 431:10-242. 
HRS § 431:10-242 states: 
Where an insurer has contested its liability under a policy
and is ordered by the courts to pay benefits under the
policy, the policyholder, the beneficiary under a policy, or
the person who has acquired the rights of the policyholder
or beneficiary under the policy shall be awarded reasonable
attorney's fees and the costs of suit, in addition to the
benefits under the policy.
 
Id. Because the statute's plain language requires an "order[] by
 
2
the courts to pay benefits,"  Mikelson filed his "Motion for
Order that Defendant [USAA] 'Pay Benefits' to Plaintiff," which
 
the circuit court granted.
 
USAA contends the circuit court erred when it granted 
the Order to Pay Benefits because Mikelson failed to adequately 
plead a claim for payment of benefits. We disagree. "Hawai fi's 
rules of notice pleading require only that a complaint set forth a short and plain statement of the claim that provides defendant 
with fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds 
upon which the claim rests[.]" Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, LLC v. 
K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai
fi 201, 215 n.17, 166 P.3d 
961, 975 n.17 (2007) (internal quotation markds and brackets 
omitted). 
Mikelson's claim for declaratory judgment stated: "USAA
 
bears, and has borne, a duty to indemnify [Mikelson] for all
 
compensatory damages to [Mikelson] that he is legally entitled to
 
recover . . . up to the limits of liability for Bodily Injury
 
Uninsured Motorist Coverage in the Policy[.]" In declaratory

 See also Ranger Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw, 103 Hawaif i 26, 34, 79 P.3d
119, 127 (2003) (concluding that although insurer contested its liability,
insured could not recover fees under HRS § 431:10-242 because the case settledafter an arbitration award, and the lower court dismissed the declaratoryaction and did not order the insurer to pay benefits). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment actions, the court has authority to grant ancillary
 
equitable relief. HRS § 632-3 (1993); see also Commerce & Indus.
 
Ins. Co. v. Bank of Hawaii, 73 Haw. 322, 329, 832 P.2d 733, 737
 
(1992) (insurer properly ordered to pay attorneys' fees and costs
 
under HRS § 431:10-242 after contesting liability via declaratory
 
relief action and being ordered to continue paying defense
 
costs). As such, Mikelson's complaint satisfied the "notice
 
pleading" requirement.
 
USAA also contends Mikelson's motion was moot because 
USAA paid the full amount of the final arbitration award before 
Mikelson filed his motion. However, an action is not moot when a 
court can still provide effective relief. See Carl Corp. v. 
State, Dep't of Educ., 93 Hawai fi 155, 165, 997 P.2d 567, 577 
(2000) (describing mootness as "a remedial issue related to the 
ability of the court to grant prospective relief"). Here, the 
motion for the Order to Pay Benefits was not moot for the purpose 
allowing Mikelson to recover attorneys' fees under HRS § 431:10­
242. Moreover, USAA's argument would allow an insurer to avoid
 
paying attorneys' fees under the statute by paying benefits
 before the insured obtains an order.
 
Accordingly, we conclude the circuit court did not err
 
when it granted the Order to Pay Benefits.
 
B. Order Granting Attorneys' Fees And Costs
 
1. Appellate Proceedings Did Not Preclude Award
 
USAA claims the appellate courts' mandates in Mikelson
 
II and Mikelson III precluded the circuit court from awarding
 
attorneys' fees and costs in connection with Count I. We
 
conclude, however, that USAA misconstrues the two opinions, and
 
neither case permanently foreclosed Mikelson's recovery of
 
attorneys' fees and costs.
 
In Mikelson II, 108 Hawai
fi at 360, 120 P.3d at 259, 
the Hawai fi Supreme Court denied Mikelson's request for 
attorneys' fees because it was premature. The supreme court noted that the circuit court's judgment carefully parsed 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entitlement to coverage and benefits, and it intentionally
 
refrained from ordering the insurer to pay benefits because the
 
payment issue would be decided via arbitration. Id. at 361, 120
 
P.3d at 260. Consequently, the supreme court denied attorneys'
 fees "under the circumstances," but it did not preclude an award
 
after arbitration and after the circuit court ordered the insurer
 
to "pay benefits" for the purposes of HRS § 431:10-242. Id. 
In Mikelson III, 122 Hawai
fi at 401, 227 P.3d at 567, 
this court affirmed the circuit court's order confirming the 
arbitration award. Because we did not expressly mandate a 
remand, USAA argues the circuit court lacked authority to take 
any further action on remand. However, our opinion, viewed as a 
whole, focused solely on reviewing the circuit court's non-final 
order, and nothing in our opinion or judgment prohibited the 
circuit court from conducting further proceedings. 
After Mikelson III, Mikelson filed a request for 
attorneys' fees which this court denied. Our order cited 
Labrador v. Liberty Mutual Group, 103 Hawai fi 206, 211-12, 81 
P.3d 386, 391-92 (2003), in which the Hawai fi Supreme Court held 
that neither arbitration nor an order to confirm an arbitration 
award satisfies the requirements of HRS § 431:10-242. 
Consequently, although we denied attorneys' fees relating to the 
arbitration award on appeal, our order did not preclude recovery 
of fees unrelated to the arbitration. 
Therefore, the circuit court here did not act
 
inconsistently with Mikelson II, Mikelson III, or our order by
 
determining Mikelson's entitlement to attorneys' fees, and the
 
circuit court did not err in concluding Mikelson was entitled to
 
recover attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with
 
Count I of Mikelson's amended complaint.
 
2. Award Entitlement: HRS § 431:10-242's Requirement
That Proceeding Be "Suit"
 
USAA also contends the circuit court erred as a matter
 
of law when it awarded attorneys' fees for the arbitration and
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arbitration confirmation proceedings. We agree with USAA's 
argument because, as noted above, the Hawai fi Supreme Court held 
in Labrador that an arbitration proceeding (including a proceeding to confirm an arbitration award) is not a "suit" under 
the HRS § 431:10-242. 
Mikelson contends Labrador is distinguishable because
 
in that case, the parties mutually agreed to arbitrate, and the
 
insured did not have to initiate a judicial proceeding until
 
filing a motion to confirm the award. Id. at 208, 81 P.3d at
 
388. The supreme court did not indicate its holding or rationale
 
was limited to the facts of that case, however. Rather, the
 
court based its conclusion on its interpretation of the statute's
 
"plain and obvious meaning." Id. at 211, 81 P.3d at 391. 
Therefore, we conclude Labrador controls this case. 
In Labrador, the Hawai
fi Supreme Court first noted that 
no previous case had decided the question of whether HRS 
§ 431:10-242 applies to arbitration awards, and it proceeded to 
interpret the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. Id. 
at 210-11, 81 P.3d at 390-91. The supreme court distinguished 
the dictionary definitions of "arbitration" and "litigation" or 
"suit," and it emphasized that arbitration is a process 
alternative to "established tribunals of justice, and is intended 
to avoid the formalities, the delay, the expense and vexation of 
ordinary litigation." Id. at 392, 81 P.3d at 212 (quoting 
Black's Law Dictionary 105 (6th ed. 1990)). The court concluded 
"an arbitration proceeding is not a 'suit' within the meaning of 
HRS § 431:10-242." Id. 
Moreover, as in Labrador, the arbitration process in 
this case was not imposed by law, and it need not have been 
judicially instituted. See Labrador, 103 Hawai fi at 213, 81 P.3d 
at 393 (distinguishing Wiegand v. Allstate Ins. Co., 68 Haw. 117, 706 P.2d 16 (1985), which extended the definition of "suit" to 
include arbitration because the statutory provisions required the 
arbitration process be initiated in a judicial proceeding). 
Here, the parties chose the arbitration process precisely as an 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
alternative to litigation, and although the arbitration was part 
of a judicial proceeding, the circuit court and the supreme court 
directed the parties to arbitration "pursuant to the Policy." 
Mikelson I, 108 Hawai fi at 360, 120 P.3d at 259. 
Therefore, because neither HRS § 431:10-242 nor the
 
governing arbitration agreement3
 provided for an award of
attorneys' fees from the arbitration, the circuit court erred
 when it awarded attorneys' fees incurred during the arbitration
 
and the award confirmation proceedings. 
3. Award Calculation
 
Lastly, USAA contends the circuit court erred in
 
calculating the amount awarded in its Order Granting Attorneys'
 
Fees and Costs. 
We agree the circuit court abused its discretion
 
when it applied a multiplier of 1.5 without specifying the facts
 or rationale supporting its conclusion.
 
A court may increase its lodestar determination by a
 
multiplier upon consideration of the following factors: 
The first of the factors to be considered for possible
adjustment of the "lodestar" determination is "the
contingent nature of success," a factor which may be of
special significance where "the attorney has no private
agreement that guarantees payment even if no recovery is
obtained." ["Lindy I," 487 F.2d at 168]. The second
additional factor to be examined "is the extent, if any, to
which the quality of an attorney's work mandates increasing
or decreasing" the "lodestar" figure. Id. If the court
 
decides an adjustment is justified on this basis, it "should
set forth as specifically as possible the facts that support
... [its] conclusion." Id. at 169.
 
Chun, 92 Hawai fi at 442, 992 P.2d at 137 (quoting Montalvo v. 
Chang, 64 Haw. 345, 359, 641 P.2d 1321, 1331 (1982)) (emphasis 
added). 
3
 "[I]n the absence of an express authorization by statute,"
attorneys' fees may be awarded in an arbitration proceeding only when "the
governing arbitration agreement provides for such an award." Hamada v. 
Westcott, 102 Hawaif i 210, 211, 74 P.3d 33, 34 (2003). The insurance policy
in this case did not provide for an award of fees and costs from thearbitration. The policy's arbitration provisions state each party shall"[p]ay the expenses it incurs" and "[b]ear the expenses of the arbitratorequally." The policy in Labrador contained identical language, and thesupreme court concluded the arbitration agreement did not authorize anattorneys' fees award. Labrador, 103 Hawaif i at 392 n.12, 81 P.3d at 212
n.12.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Neither the circuit court's Order Granting Attorneys' 
Fees and Costs, nor Final Judgment, nor the transcript from the 
hearing on Mikelson's motion for attorneys' fees and costs gives 
any indication of the circuit court's basis for applying a 
multiplier of 1.5. Although the trial court judge is in the best 
position to determine the reasonableness of attorneys' fees 
incurred for work in this case, Nelson v. Univ. of Hawai fi, 99 
Hawaifi 262, 269, 54 P.3d 433, 440 (2002), the trial court abused 
its discretion when it calculated the award without setting forth 
as specifically as possible the facts that support its adjustment 
of the lodestar. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate (1) the May 3, 2012
 
"Order Granting Plaintiff Mathew S. Mikelson's Renewed Motion For
 
Attorney Fees And Costs Under Haw. Rev. Stat. § 431:10-242" and
 
(2)
 the May 3, 2012 "Final Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff Mathew
 
S. Mikelson and Against Defendant United Services Automobile
 Association" entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
We remand this case for further proceedings.
