OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SEAN CONROY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-0355)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
On July 8, 2011, Defendant-Appellant Sean Conroy was 
indicted for Assault in the First Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 707-710(1) (1993). On March 7, 2012,
 a jury found Conroy guilty of the lesser-included offense of
 Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-711
 (Supp. 2010). Conroy appeals from the subsequent Judgment;
 Conviction and Probation Sentence; Notice of Entry ("Judgment"),
 which the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit ("Circuit Court")
 entered on May 2, 2012.

In his points of error on appeal, Conroy addresses
 
three specific statements by the deputy prosecuting attorney
 ("Prosecutor") in his closing and rebuttal-closing arguments, but
 he contends more broadly that "[t]he Government engaged in
 prosecutorial misconduct when improper arguments and insinuations
 were made to the jury during closing argument. . . . The entire
 closing argument contains a stream of characterizations offered
 to raise and inflame the passions of the jury, and not based upon
 the evidence adduced at trial." In the legal argument that
 follows, Conroy addresses ten of the Prosecutor's statements.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Specifically, Conroy contends that the following statements
 
constituted prosecutorial misconduct:
 
[Statement 1] You can see and you heard from the
evidence the Defendant is immensely larger than [the
complaining witness ("CW"),] but she was just trying to get
him to leave her alone. At that point, the Defendant
retaliated with all his six-foot-five-inch or plus 250-pound
power, he punched the nine -- five-foot-nine, 120-pound [CW]
in the face. At that point, I would submit he's finally
unleashing all of the anger, the frustration, the jealousy,
the rage that he had because she no longer wanted to be with
him. 
[Statement 2] Their marriage was going down.  [CW] no
longer gave the Defendant nature's smile, so he was going to
make sure that she didn't give that smile to any other man,
and she won't. She can't.
 
[Statement 3] He was going to teach her a lesson, a 
lesson that she would never, could never forget, a lesson she
would remember every time she looked in a mirror.  Look at
 [CW]'s eyes. What do you see in those eyes?  Resignation,
defeat, a woman that's learned her lesson. We should teach
 her a new lesson. I say we teach her that there is justice in
the world. I say we teach her that there can be justice in
 this[.]
 
[Statement 4] Consider that, you know, when Defendant
broke [CW]'s face, when you look at the way she testified,
consider her demeanor, the pictures of her after the scene.
He broke something inside of her as well. 
[Statement 5] We all want [CW]'s spirit to heal even if
her face won't. 
But in order for that to happen, there has to
 
be justice done.
 
[Statement 6] [H]ow does 
a man who has [allegedly] been
kicked directly on his right testicle [and who is allegedly]
bent over in excruciating pain deliver two power punches
strong enough to break [CW]'s left cheek, shatter her nose and
send her 120-pound body flying onto the hood of the Camaro?
Explain that. Explain also why there were no tears on the
Defendant's face when he was testifying.
 
[Statement 7] You break my heart, I break your face.
That's what this case is about.
 
[Statement 8] Anyway, I defy anyone to show that two
quick jabs are going to 
cause the kind of injuries that we saw
in the evidence in this case.
 
[Statement 9] Now, the 
defense says that the Defendant's
testimony was more credible, that he had no duty to testify,
but he did to tell you what happened. But I would submit that
 he had to.
 
[Statement 10] The statement itself, you'll behold as
far as credibility, you can consider the probability or
improbability of a person's statement. . . .  If it was a kick
 to his right testicle and he was bent over in excruciating
pain, he would not have been able to hit anybody.  I think
 that's part of, certainly for the guys here[.]

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Conroy's points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
I.	 Discussion
 
In order to evaluate Conroy's claims, we will make a 
threshold determination as to whether prosecutorial misconduct 
occurred, and then, if any statements qualify, we will determine whether any of those rise to the level of reversible error by employing a three-prong harmless-error analysis. See State v. 
Tuua, 125 Hawai
'i 10, 14, 250 P.3d 273, 277 (2011). 
A.	 Whether Any of the Prosecutor's Comments Constituted
Misconduct.
 
"[C]losing argument affords the prosecution (as well as 
the defense) the opportunity to persuade the jury that its theory 
of the case is valid, based upon the evidence adduced and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom." State v. 
Basham, 132 Hawai

State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai 'i 405, 413, 984 P.2d 1231, 1239 (1999)). 
"Although a prosecutor has wide latitude in commenting on the evidence during closing argument, it is not enough that . . . his comments are based on testimony 'in evidence'; his comments must also be 'legitimate.'" Tuua, 125 Hawai
'i at 14, 250 P.3d at 277 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(quoting State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i 235, 253, 178 P.3d 1, 19 
(2008)). "A prosecutor's comments are legitimate when they draw 
'reasonable' inferences from the evidence." Id. (quoting 
Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i at 253-54, 178 P.3d at 19-20). 
Here, Conroy's objections to the Prosecutor's closing-
and rebuttal-closing arguments fall into three categories.2
 
First, Conroy asserts that, in Statements 1 and 2, the Prosecutor
 improperly argued facts not in evidence. Second, Conroy contends
 that the Prosecutor sought to improperly inflame the jury and to
 cause the jury to render a verdict based on "passion and
 prejudice" via Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7. Third, Conroy argues
 that Statements 6, 8, 9, and 10 represent improper assertions of
 the Prosecutor's personal opinion. Based on the following
 analysis, we find that Statement 7 arguably qualifies as
 "prosecutorial misconduct" and warrants harmless-error review.
 
(1 & 2) Conroy asserts that Statements 1 and 2 
represent the Prosecutor's attempt "to emphasize a claim of jealousy and rage in [Conroy and CW's] relationship," which "is not supported by the evidence." Because defense counsel did not object to either of these statements at trial, we consider whether their utterance "amounted to plain error which affected the substantial rights of the defendant." State v. Klinge, 92 
Hawai
'i 577, 592, 994 P.2d 509, 524 (2000) (citations omitted); 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 52(b). We disagree with Conroy and conclude that both statements are based on "'reasonable' inferences from the evidence," Tuua, 125 Hawai
'i at 14, 250 P.3d at 277, and that 
Conroy had a fair opportunity to respond to the evidence on which Statements 1 and 2 are based. Thus, their inclusion in the 
2/
 Conroy's opening brief fails to comply with the requirements of
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28 insofar as it neither
articulates precisely why Statements 3, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are allegedly improper
nor provides any authority in support of that general contention. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). This court may "disregard a particular contention if the
appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position." Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (quoting
In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727
(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). Due 
to our policy of "affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their casesheard on the merits, where possible,'" however, we nonetheless proceed on the
merits insofar as we can discern them. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490,
496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (quoting Morgan v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai' i 
173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004)). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Prosecutor's closing argument was reasonable and did not 
prejudicially affect Conroy's substantial rights. See State v. 
Acker, 133 Hawai 'i 253, 280, 327 P.3d 931, 958 (2014) (finding no 
prosecutorial misconduct where "there was a basis in the evidence for the [Prosecutor]'s argument, and the [Prosecutor]'s comments were permissible comments on the evidence." (quoting Rogan, 91 Hawai
'i at 412, 984 P.2d at 1238 (internal quotation marks and 
brackets omitted))). 
(3 & 5) Conroy alleges that the Prosecutor's closing
 
argument contained several statements intended "to anger the jury
 and draw out their sympathies," which, according to Conroy,
 constitutes an improper attempt to inflame the jury's passions. 
Specifically, Conroy contends that Statements 3 and 5 appealed to
 the jury's sense of justice by improperly encouraging the jury to
 view its forthcoming verdict as a means to send a message rather
 than to view its duties as a jury to decide the case only based
 on the specific evidence presented.
3
 
Here, in the send-a-message portions of Statements 3 
and 5, the Prosecutor invited the jury to consider the potential impact of its verdict on the alleged victim (CW) and the perpetrator (Conroy), rather than on other criminals or on society in general. In so doing, the Prosecutor did not encourage the jury to base its verdict on considerations beyond the evidence. See State v. Florence, No. CAAP-11-0000608, 2012 
WL 5897465, at *3 (Hawai
'i App. Nov. 23, 2012) ("The prosecutor's 
statement to the jury that 'you need to hold [the defendant] fully responsible for everything he's done and not giv[e] him any breaks, which they are asking for' was not improper because the prosecutor was commenting on the evidence and presenting reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence." (original brackets omitted)), cert. rejected, 2013 WL 811443 (Hawai
'i Mar. 
4, 2013). That is, the Prosecutor's calls for justice occurred within the context of his comment on the evidence and his 
3/
 The court sustained defense counsel's objection to Statement 3 for
"passion, prejudice." However, when defense counsel objected to Statement 5
for the same reason, the court merely stated: "So noted, Counsel." Defense
 counsel did not request that the court strike either of these statements from
the record, and the court did not do so sua sponte.
 
5
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
presentation of conclusions that could be drawn from that
 
evidence. Compare United States v. Sanchez, 659 F.3d, 1252,
 
1256-57 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding the prosecutor's request that
 the jury "send a memo" to other drug traffickers impermissibly
 urged the jury to convict for reasons unrelated to the individual
 defendant's culpability); with Florence, 2012 WL 5897465, at *3.
 
Conroy has not provided any authority suggesting that 
such a justice-based argument constitutes prosecutorial misconduct, and without more, we cannot hold that either Statement 5, or the portion of Statement 3 in which the Prosecutor urged the jury to teach Conroy a lesson about justice, were improper. See Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 
at 713 n.16 (citations omitted); accord Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). 
Although the portion of Statement 3 where the
 
Prosecutor speculated as to CW's state-of-mind after the assault
 presents a close case, we hold that it also does not rise to the
 level of "prosecutorial misconduct." See generally United States
 
v. Moore, 651 F.3d 30, 53 (D.C. Cir. 2011) ("Because the line
 between permissible and impermissible arguments will not always
 be clear, the inquiry is necessarily contextual."). 
In that statement, which occurred during the State's
 
closing argument, the Prosecutor interpreted the look in CW's
 eyes for the jury as showing "[r]esignation, defeat, [indicative
 of] a woman [who]'s learned her lesson." Admittedly, the
 evidentiary support for such an interpretation is both somewhat
 scant and indirect. Thus, the Prosecutor arguably offered an
 unsworn statement of his own opinion that could have "intruded on
 the jurors' role as fact-finders" in this portion of Statement 3. 
Id. at 1243-44. 
Although arguably close to the line, the Prosecutor's
 
conduct did not cross it. Here, the relevant portion of
 Statement 3 involves a remark about the CW's demeanor and the
 emotion behind the "look in [one's] eyes"—especially when there
 is a photo of the CW in evidence taken shortly after the
 incident—is arguably the kind of "self-evident proposition well
 within the common understanding of lay jurors" that would not
 generally require expert testimony in support, Thompson, 318 P.3d
 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 1245. Thus, on balance, we hold that Statement 3 was not
 
improper.4
 
(4 & 7) Conroy also argues that the Prosecutor 
improperly appealed to the jury's emotions in Statement 4. With those remarks, the Prosecutor asked each member of the jury to assess CW's credibility as a witness. He urged the jurors not to forget about their personal observations of the witnesses who testified and other evidence admitted at trial–including "the way [CW] testified, . . . her demeanor, [and] the pictures of her after the scene." Such a request permissibly evokes the jury's legal responsibility, as "the fact finder[,] to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of fact[.]" State v. Clark, 83 Hawai
'i 289, 303-04, 926 P.2d 194, 208-09 
(1996) (ellipsis omitted) (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i 
131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996)).5 Accordingly, the demeanor-
highlighting aspect of Statement 4 is not improper. 
The Prosecutor's reference to the incident as "when
 
Defendant broke [CW]'s face" in Statement 4 was also not
 misconduct because it is amply supported by undisputed evidence
 of CW's multiple facial fractures, and Conroy's admission that he
 punched CW twice in the face. Moreover, the Prosecutor's claim
 that Conroy "broke something inside of [CW] as well" is arguably
 supported by evidence in the record.
6 See id. at 306, 926 P.2d
 
at 211. 
4/
 Furthermore, even if we assume for the sake of argument that this
portion of Statement 3 was improper, it is still unquestionably harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt and thus does not warrant a different outcome.
First, the Prosecutor's questionable characterization of the look in CW's eyes
is logically supported, albeit indirectly, by a few facts in the record.
Second, the court sustained defense counsel's objection to Statement 3. And
 finally, the evidence supporting Conroy's conviction was overwhelming. Thus,
even if we were to conclude that Statement 3 qualified as "prosecutorial
misconduct," it was certainly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
5/
 Indeed, the court's instruction number seven to the jury at the
close of trial explained how to accomplish this: "In evaluating the weight and
credibility of a witness's testimony, [the jury] may consider the witness's
appearance and demeanor; the witness's manner of testifying; . . . [and] the
extent to which the witness is supported or contradicted by other evidence
. . . ." 
6/
 The transcripts contain repeated witness descriptions of CW as
"dazed" and "out of it" after the incident, and the parties engaged in much
discussion about the permanency of CW's (in)ability to smile the way she did
before the assault. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Conroy argues that Statement 7 was an improper attempt
 
to encourage the jury to make its decision on the basis of
 
passion and prejudice. Although, Statement 7 is rhetorically
 similar to Statement 4 and thematically similar to Statement 1,
 both of which we conclude were not improper, Statement 7 is
 distinguishable in two important ways that make it improper.
 
First, unlike Statement 4, which also referred to
 
metaphorical "breaks" in addition to CW's physical bone
 fractures, Statement 7 is phrased in the "first person point of
 view," thereby arguably placing words that were never spoken at
 trial into Conroy's mouth. Cf., generally, Berger, 295 U.S. at
 
84 (holding that the prosecuting attorney was guilty of
 misconduct because, among other things, he "misstat[ed] the facts
 in his cross examination of witnesses" and "put[] into the mouths
 of such witnesses things which they had not said . . . ."). Not
 only does this raise constitutional issues such as encroaching on
 the defendant's Fifth-Amendment rights at trial, but, as a false
 assertion that Conroy made certain statements that he did not in
 fact make, it cannot be said to reasonably follow from the
 evidence at trial.
 
And second, although there was sufficient testimony to
 
support the Prosecutor's assertion of a jealousy-based motive in
 Statement 1, Statement 7 is problematic because neither party
 elicited specific testimony from Conroy from which a reasonable
 juror might infer that Conroy was suffering from a broken
 heart—i.e., neither party questioned Conroy about his specific,
 emotional reaction to his ending marriage with CW, nor did any
 other witness suggest that the couple's break was non-mutual or
 unexpected. Thus, unlike the Prosecutor's bare reference to CW's
 emotional injuries, which, as explained above, was likely
 permissible, the prosecutor improperly exaggerated his arguments
 with respect to Conroy's state of mind. See Moore, 651 F.3d at
 
53 ("Sensationalization, loosely drawn from facts presented
 during the trial, is still a 'statement[] of fact to the jury not
 supported by proper evidence introduced during trial,' clearly
 'designed to inflame the passions of the jury.'" (internal
 citations omitted)). In so doing, the Prosecutor encouraged the
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
jury to base their verdict on passion, rather than the relevant
 
facts and law at hand. Accordingly, the Prosecutor improperly
 sensationalized the evidence in Statement 7 and offered
 unsupported conclusions about Conroy's state of mind.
 
(6, 8, 9 & 10) Conroy challenges Statements 6, 8, 9, 
and 10, in which the Prosecutor implicated Conroy's credibility as a defendant-witness. "It is well-established 'under Hawai
'i 
case law that prosecutors are bound to refrain from expressing their personal views as to a defendant's guilt or the credibility of witnesses'" in statements before the jury. Basham, 132 
Hawai
'i at 115, 319 P.3d at 1123 (quoting Clark, 83 Hawai 'i at 
304, 926 P.2d at 209); accord Tuua, 125 Hawai 'i at 14, 250 P.3d 
at 277 (quoting State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai 'i 390, 424-25, 56 
P.3d 692, 726–27 (2002)). Such a prohibition helps to maintain the distinction between argument and evidence and seeks to avoid the special weight juries often afford to the State's comments. See State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 660-61, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 (1986); e.g., State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai
'i 83, 95, 26 P.3d 572, 
584 (2001) (overturning a conviction where the [prosecutor] "characteriz[ed] . . . Pacheco as an 'asshole[,]' [which] strongly conveyed his personal opinion and could only have been calculated to inflame the passions of the jurors and to divert them . . . from their duty to decide the case on the evidence"). 
Pursuant to the foregoing discussion, we conclude that
 
even though the Prosecutor couched many of his credibility
 arguments in language suggesting that he could have been sharing
 his own beliefs on the matter, Statements 6, 8, and 9 represent
 permissible commentary on both the evidence in the record–whether
 conflicting or otherwise–and also the credibility of witnesses
 who offered that evidence. As such, those statements were not
 improper. Furthermore, when taken in context, it is clear that
 the Prosecutor intended Statement 10 to direct the jury's
 attention to a "self-evident" fact within the "common
 understanding" of lay persons—i.e., that when a man is kicked in
 the groin, the immediate effects can be debilitating. Thompson,
 318 P.3d at 1245. Moreover, evidence was adduced at trial that,
 
at least for Maui Police Department Officer William Melton,
 
9
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[a]nytime a guy gets kicked in the groin, that's an attention
 
grabber," supports such a reading. Based on Officer Melton's
 statement and Conroy's testimony regarding the precise way in
 which he was bent in pain after being allegedly kicked in the
 groin, it is unlikely that Statement 10 served to direct the
 jury's attention to facts outside of the evidence in the case.
7
 
Thus, Statement 10 was also not improper.
 
B.	 Whether the Improper Statement Was Harmless Beyond a
Reasonable Doubt.
 
We have concluded that Statement 7 was improper. This 
conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. Rather, 
"[p]rosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial or the setting aside of a guilty verdict only where the actions of the prosecutor have caused prejudice to the defendant's right to a fair trial." State v. Carvalho, 106 Hawai
'i 13, 16 n.7, 100 P.3d 
607, 610 n.7 (App. 2004) (quoting State v. McGriff, 76 Hawai 'i 
148, 158, 871 P.2d 782, 792 (1994)). To determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we consider "whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have contributed to [Conroy's] conviction." Kekona, 120 Hawai
'i at 445, 209 P.3d at 1259 (quoting Espiritu, 
117 Hawai 'i at 141, 176 P.3d at 899). The following three 
factors are relevant to this determination: "(1) the nature of the conduct; (2) the promptness [or lack] of a curative instruction; and (3) the strength or weakness of the evidence 
7/
 Although the second part of Statement 10 arguably takes the form
of an improper "Golden-Rule" argument in that the Prosecutor effectively urged
the jurors to abandon their impartial role and instead find facts from
Conroy's more interested viewpoint, see Thompson 318 P.3d at 1244-45 
(explaining that certain improper statements made by the prosecutor affected
the objective detachment required of fact finders), we know of no authorityextending the argument to situations in which the prosecutor asks the jurors
to put themselves in the offender/defendant's place, rather than in the placeof the victim or her family. See Ditto v. McCurdy, 86 Hawai' i 93, 127, 947
P.2d 961, 995 (App. 1997) (citing Black's Law Dictionary, 623 (5th ed. 1979)),aff'd in part, rev'd on other grounds, 86 Hawai' i 84, 947 P.2d 952 (1997).
E.g., Rogan, 91 Hawai' i at 414, 984 P.2d at 1240 (noting that a prosecutor's
characterization of "the incident as 'every mother's nightmare,' . . . was a
blatantly improper plea to evoke sympathy for the complainant's mother andrepresented an implied invitation to the jury to put themselves in her
position); see also Sechrest v. Baker, 603 Fed. Appx. 548, 551 (9th Cir. 2015)
("[T]he statements in which the prosecutor called on the jurors to imagine the
state of mind of the victims were . . . improper." (citing another source))). 
10
  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
against the defendant." State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawai 'i 432, 453, 
279 P.3d 1237, 1258 (2012) (quoting Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i at 
252, 178 P.3d at 18) (internal quotation marks omitted). Below,
 
we consider Statement 7 in relation to each of the three factors.
 
As to the first factor, Conroy argues on appeal that
 
the "nature" of the above-excerpted portions of the State's
 closing arguments
 
show[] repeated purposeful conduct where the government
prosecutor s[ought] to inflame the passions of the jury in an
improper manner. By inference and innuendo, the prosecutor
s[ought] to suggest a concerted, calculated and planned effort
on the part of the defendant, when the record was devoid of
such evidence. His argument [was, in effect,] telling the
jury to feel sorry for the scope of the injury to the
complainant and convict Conroy on that basis. Such a tactic
 is improper.
 
In order to assess whether the first factor weighs in favor of 
holding Statement 7 to be harmless, we "evaluate the severity of the conduct" and its ultimate effect on the proceedings. Tuua, 125 Hawai
'i at 16, 250 P.3d at 279. 
Statement 7 was a dramatic, one-line summary of the
 
State's theory of the case. By referring to Conroy's act of
 punching CW in the face, which caused her several facial
 fractures, as the time when Conroy broke CW's face, the
 Prosecutor tied in the rhetoric of his previously delivered
 initial closing argument (which stated, for example, that "when
 Defendant broke [CW]'s face, . . . [h]e broke something inside of
 her as well") and, as a result, made the State's entire argument
 more cohesive. 
The nature of the statement was improper, however, 
because it was phrased in the first-person point of view—You break my heart, I break your face—as though Conroy either spoke those words or had this thought at some time. Yet Conroy never testified that he intended to hurt CW; he was not asked, and did not disclose, his emotions regarding the divorce or ending relationship, nor did he tell the jury anything to support an inference that his actions were premeditated (although other witnesses seemed to attribute that type of sentiment to him). Accordingly, it might be said that "the statement[] diverted the jury from its duty to decide the instant case on the evidence" before it. Walsh, 125 Hawai

Mattson, 122 Hawai 'i at 326, 226 P.3d at 496). Moreover, by 
figuratively putting words in Conroy's mouth, the Prosecutor 
indirectly implicated Conroy's Fifth-Amendment rights. Accordingly, the first factor weighs in favor of finding that Statement 7 was not harmless. See Schnabel, 127 Hawai
'i at 449­
50, 279 P.3d at 1254-55 (explaining that improper statements of this kind are usually not harmless when they implicate the defendant's constitutional rights). 
Factor 2 augurs in favor of harmlessness because Conroy 
objected to Statement 7, and the trial court sustained the objection, and because defense counsel followed up its objection to Statement 7 with an oral motion to strike, which the court granted before instructing the jury to disregard the remarks. Cf., e.g., Pacheco, 96 Hawai
'i at 96, 26 P.3d at 585 ("[B]y 
overruling defense counsel's objection, the circuit court, at least tacitly, placed its imprimatur upon the [Prosecutor's improper statement], thereby risking the implication that it, too believed [the statement] and inviting the jury to share in that belief."). See generally State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai
'i 504, 
516, 78 P.3d 317, 329 (2003) ("Generally we consider a curative instruction sufficient to cure prosecutorial misconduct because we presume that the jury heeds the court's instruction to disregard improper prosecution comments." (citing Rogan, 91 Hawai
'i at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241)). 
As to the third factor, Conroy concludes that, "given
 
the inconsistencies of the government witnesses and the context
 of the chaotic nature of the event, the evidence was by no means
 clearly in favor of the Government." We disagree.
 
In order to convict Conroy of Assault in the Second
 
Degree, the State was required to prove each element of the
 offense, and the state of mind required for each element, beyond
 a reasonable doubt. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 701-114 (1993); see also
 Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-205 (1993). Section 707-711(1) of the HRS
 defines the offense at issue and provides that "[a] person
 commits the offense of assault in the second degree if: (a) The
 person intentionally or knowingly causes substantial bodily
 injury to another; [or] (b) The person recklessly causes
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . substantial bodily injury to another[.]" Furthermore,
 
"[s]ubstantial bodily injury" is defined, in relevant part, as
 "bodily injury which causes . . . [a] bone fracture . . . ." 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-700 (Supp. 2010). 
Here, it is undisputed that CW suffered multiple
 
fractures of her facial bones as a result of the incident.
 Moreover, it is undisputed that Conroy caused these injuries. 
Thus, Conroy caused CW "substantial bodily injury" in the form of
 multiple bone fractures within the meaning of the statute. See
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-700. Therefore, regardless of any improper
 statements by the Prosecutor, the undisputed evidence clearly
 supports the result-of-conduct element of Conroy's conviction. 
Moreover, even if we were to accept Conroy's version of 
events as true, the evidence adduced at trial compels the conclusion that Conroy's conduct in punching CW, was, at the very least, reckless. The degree of culpability required to commit Assault in the Second Degree is either "intentionally," "knowingly," or "recklessly." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-711(a) and (b). Because these terms "are [listed] in a descending order of culpability, [HRS § 702-208 (1993)] establishes that 'it is only necessary [for the State] to articulate the minimal basis of liability[, i.e., recklessness,] for the more serious bases to be implied.'" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-208 cmt. (citing Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 4, comments at 129 (1955)); see Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i at 140, 913 P.2d at 66 ("[T]he prosecution 
needs only to prove the lowest of the three alternative levels of culpability, i.e., recklessness, in order to satisfy the state of mind requirement [for this offense]."). Under HRS § 702-206(3) (1993): 
(c) A person acts recklessly with respect to a result of his
conduct when he consciously disregards a substantial and
unjustifiable risk that his conduct will cause such a result.
 
(d) A risk is substantial and unjustifiable  within the
 
meaning of this section if, considering the nature and purpose
of  the  person's  conduct  and  the  circumstances  known  to him,
the disregard of the risk involves a gross deviation from the
 standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in
 the same situation.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-206(3)(c) and (d) (emphasis added).

Here, with regard to the issue of intent, Conroy 
testified both that he acted reflexively in response to being 
kicked in the groin and also that he had not been aiming for CW's face. However, Conroy outweighed CW by more than 100 pounds at the time of the assault, and he is at least eight inches taller than her. Moreover, Conroy punched CW with sufficient force to fracture her nose and cheekbone. Assuming for the sake of argument, then, that Conroy's testimony was true, the jury could still have found that he consciously disregarded the risk that his conduct presented to CW, and that his disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the ordinary person's standard of conduct. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-206(3)(c) and (d). Indeed, Conroy did not argue that he was mistaken as to the identity of his alleged assailant, nor was he unfamiliar with CW's strength and size, and he was at least aware that he was punching CW. See In re Doe, 
107 Hawai
'i 12, 19, 108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005). Accordingly, 
Conroy should have been aware of his far superior size and strength, and it is likely that an ordinary, law abiding individual with similar attributes would have exercised a greater degree of care when confronted with minor physical confrontation by a much smaller individual. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 702-206(3)(d). Thus, the State presented overwhelming evidence of recklessness. 
Finally, Conroy urges us to "focus on the claim of self 
defense," which, he asserts, the State failed to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt.
8 The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has explained, 
however, that: "As to whether the prosecution disproved [a defendant]'s claim of self defense beyond a reasonable doubt, 'essentially, the prosecution does this when the trier of fact believes its case and disbelieves the defense.'" Doe, 107 
Hawai
'i at 19, 108 P.3d at 973 (original brackets omitted) 
8/
 In Conroy's words, the evidence supporting his claim of self-
defense included:
 
Conroy's [testimony] that he was kicked in the groin and
punched in the head "before" he lashed out. There were
 multiple incidents where CW attacked and injured Conroy in the
past. She hit him with a TV remote control in his head and
 knocked out a tooth. CW also kicked his hand and broke a
 finger in a prior incident[, and] CW admitted she struck
Conroy first in this incident.

(quoting State v. Pavao, 81 Hawai 'i 142, 146, 913 P.2d 553, 557 
(App. 1996)). Therefore, Conroy has failed to offer any 
authority or demonstrate any facts that would compel an alternative result. 
In sum, although the first factor arguably weighs 
against a finding of harmlessness as to Statement 7, factors two and three both weigh in favor of a determination that those remarks were, in fact, harmless. Moreover, the third factor is frequently found to be the decisive factor in such a harmless-error analysis. See Schnabel, 127 Hawai
'i at 456 n.48, 279 P.3d 
at 1261 n.18. On balance, then, any error associated with Statement 7 appears to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
II. Conclusion
 
Pursuant to the foregoing, we conclude that the bulk of
 
the challenged statements do not reflect misconduct, and any
 
misconduct associated with Statement 7 was harmless. Therefore,
 the May 2, 2012 Judgment is affirmed.
