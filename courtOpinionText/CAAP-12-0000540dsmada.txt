APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiffs-Appellants Marlene
 
Tim Sing, individually and as next friend to her daughter
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Makalika Tim Sing, a minor, and as personal representative for 
the Estate of Dale Kanani Tim Sing, deceased, Dale Cordero, Kale Tim Sing, and Lokelani Tim Sing (collectively referred to as the Sing Appellants) have asserted from the Honorable Glenn S. Hara's May 3, 2012 judgment, because the May 3, 2012 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), Rules 54 and 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), 
and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals in civil matters from 
all final judgments, orders, or decrees of the circuit courts. We initially note that under HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine, even in the absence of a separate judgment we have "h[e]ld that an order enforcing a settlement agreement is a collateral order which is appealable." Cook v. Surety Life 
Insurance, Company, 79 Hawai' i 403, 408, 903 P.2d 708, 713 (App. 
1995). Therefore, the antecedent order to the May 3, 2012 judgment, namely the April 11, 2012 order granting Defendant/ Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Konrad K. Mossman's (Appellee Mossman) motion to enforce a settlement agreement, and Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Huihui Lavon Kanahele-Mossman's (Appellee Kanahele-Mossman) joinder therein, was an immediately appealable collateral order under HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine. However, the Sing Appellants did not file their June 1, 2012 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the April 11, 2012 order, as Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawaii Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) requires for a timely appeal. Nevertheless, "[t]he failure to take an immediate appeal from a collateral order does not preclude review of the order on appeal from a final judgment." Hoopai v. Civil Service Commission, 106 
Hawai'i 205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 375 (2004) (citation omitted). 
The circuit court attempted to enter an appealable 
final judgment on one or more but fewer than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b) by entering the May 3, 2012 judgment, which purports to enter judgment in favor of Appellee Mossman, Appellee Kanahele-Mossman, and Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee County of Hawai' i (Appellee County of Hawai' i) 
and against the Sing Appellants. However, in order to be appealable, the May 3, 2012 judgment must satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641­1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins, in which the Supreme Court of Hawai' i held that "[a]n appeal may 
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). "Thus, based 
on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, "an 
appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against
 
all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification
 under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d 
at 1338. For example, "a judgment or order in a consolidated
 case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is
 not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b)
 certification." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 109 Hawai' i 8, 13, 
122 P.3d 803, 808 (2005). In addition,
 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
Finally, under HRCP Rule 54(b),
 
the power of a lower court to enter a certification of
finality is limited to only those cases where (1) more than
one claim for relief is presented or multiple parties (at
least three) are involved, . . . and (2) the judgment
entered completely disposes of at least one claim or all of
the claims by or against at least one party.
 
Elliot Megdal and Associates v. Daio USA Corporation, 87 Hawai' i 
129, 133, 952 P.2d 886, 890 (App. 1998) (citations omitted;
 
emphasis added). When interpreting the requirements for a
 judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
explained that 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Although this appeal from the consolidated cases of 
Civil No. 05-1-0297 and Civil No. 05-1-0413 involves multiple 
claims, including, among other things, three separate and distinct counts in the Sing Plaintiffs' second amended complaint and multiple cross-claims by Appellee Mossman, Appellee Kanahele-Mossman, Appellee County of Hawai' i, and Defendant/Cross-Claim 
Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Edith K. Kanakaole Foundation, the May 3, 2012 judgment does not specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment, other than a vague reference "as to the claims and issues set forth herein[.]" Where, as here, a circuit court intends to enter a judgment in a case involving multiple claims, the judgment must specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment. Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. Otherwise, the burden falls on 
the appellate courts to search the voluminous record and attempt to determine the claim or claims that the judgment purports to resolve. As the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained, 
"[n]either the parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality[.]" Id. Therefore, the May 3, 2012 judgment does not 
satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction and the Sing Appellants' appeal is premature. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-12-0000540 is dismissed for lack of
 jurisdiction.
