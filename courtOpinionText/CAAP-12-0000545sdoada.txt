(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this post-summary judgment ejectment action brought
 
by Plaintiff-Appellee Menehune Sun, LLC ("Menehune Sun"),
 
Defendants-Appellants Inoke L. Yalimaiwai and Michelle I.
 Yalimaiwai ("the Yalimaiwais") appeal from the May 2, 2012 Notice
 of Entry of Judgment on Order Granting Plaintiff Menehune Sun
 LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed Herein on February 3,
 2012, And For Possession, filed in the Circuit Court

 The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall presided.

 The Yalimaiwais failed to attach the judgment or order appealed
from to the Notice of Appeal in violation of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 3(c)(2). Nevertheless, because (1) the document was
attached as an exhibit to the Civil Appeal Docketing Statement filed twenty-eight days later on June 29, 2012; (2) "a mistake in designating the judgmentshould not result in loss of the appeal as long as the intention to appealfrom a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the
appellee is not misled by the mistake", Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai' i 289, 294, 75

'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 60(b) 
motion for reconsideration, all of which were entered in the Circuit Court.

On appeal, the Yalimaiwais raise three points of error
 
wherein they contend that: (1) the Circuit Court erred in
 dismissing as hearsay the "uncontroverted" affidavit the
 Yalimaiwais presented in their opposition to Menehune Sun's
 motion for summary judgment ("MSJ"); (2) the Circuit Court erred
 in granting summary judgment to Menehune Sun "given the
 unrebutted affidavit submitted in opposition to the motion by the
 Yalimaiwais"; and (3) the Circuit Court abused its discretion by
 "denying [the Yalimaiwais'] Rule 60(b) motion to set aside a
 grant of summary judgment when presented with unrebutted evidence
 of fraud in the non-judicial foreclosure."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we conclude
 that the Yalimaiwais' arguments are without merit, and affirm:
 
(1) The Yalimaiwais contend that the Circuit Court
 
abused its discretion when it deemed Teri L. Petit's affidavit
4
 
("Affidavit") to be "a hearsay Affidavit" because "[t]here was no
 evidence that the Affidavit lacked trustworthiness[,] and the
 
3
 The written orders for the Minute Order denying the Motion to
Reconsider Ruling and the oral decision denying the HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for
reconsideration were not filed in the Circuit Court until November 16, 2012,
and were not thereafter made a part of the record on appeal in this case.
Minute orders and oral decisions are not otherwise appealable.

 Teri L. Petit is purported to be a mortgage broker and "Forensic
Loan Auditor" based in Illinois.

Court gave no further explanation, cited no evidentiary Rule or
 
general proposition of law, [and failed to] indicate[] which, if
 any, portions of the twelve (12) page Affidavit contained
 hearsay." We disagree.
 
Affidavits submitted by parties in support of a motion 
for summary judgment "shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein." Adams v. CDM Media USA, Inc., 
135 Hawai
'i 1, 28, 346 P.3d 70, 97 (2015) (quoting Haw. R. Civ. 
P. 56(e)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts scrutinize such affidavits to determine whether the facts they aver are admissible at trial and are made on the personal knowledge of the affiant. Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 66, 828 P.2d 286, 292 
(1991). And "[t]o the extent that the affidavits [do] not comply with [HRCP Rule 56(e),] they should be disregarded." Hawaii 
Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai
'i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 
9 (2000) (quoting Cahill v. Hawaiian Paradise Park Corp., 56 Haw. 522, 539, 543 P.2d 1356, 1367 (1975)) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, "'[a]n affidavit consisting of inadmissible hearsay cannot serve as a basis for awarding or denying summary judgment.'" Keka, 94 Hawai
'i at 221, 11 P.3d at 9 (quoting GE 
Capital Hawaii, Inc. v. Miguel, 92 Hawai 'i 236, 242, 990 P.2d 
134, 140 (App. 1999)). 
Here, the Affidavit, which was submitted by the 
Yalimaiwais in support of their opposition to the motion for summary judgment, did not contain any information verifying Petit's qualifications or personal knowledge of the Yalimaiwais' loan and foreclosure. Yet in Hawai
'i, "[a] witness may not 
testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter." Adams, 135 Hawai
'i at 28, 346 P.3d at 97 (quoting Haw. 
R. Evid. 602) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the exhibits discussed in the Affidavit were not attached. See, 
e.g., GE Capital Hawaii, 92 Hawai
'i at 242, 990 P.2d at 140, 
overruled on other grounds by Price v. AIG Hawai 'i Ins. Co., 107 
Hawai'i 106, 111 P.3d 1 (2005) (affidavit contained hearsay that 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not qualify under any exception when affiant testified
 
regarding alleged default based on records and files that were
 never introduced into evidence); Pac. Concrete Fed. Credit Union
 v. Kauanoe, 62 Haw. 334, 336, 614 P.2d 936, 938 (1980) ("All  
papers referred to in the affidavits must also be attached and sworn to or certified. These requirements are mandatory."); Fuller v. Pac. Med. Collections, Inc., 78 Haw. 213, 224, 891 P.2d 300, 311 (App. 1995) ("The HRCP require that exhibits attached to a motion for summary judgment must be supported by an appropriate affidavit or certification."). Therefore, the Affidavit did not comply with the requirements of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure, and the court could not consider it. 
In sum, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding
 
that "the affidavit is a hearsay affidavit and that the exhibits
 referenced in that affidavit were not attached."
 
(2)
 The Yalimaiwais contend that the Circuit Court 
erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of Menehune Sun. In support, they cite to Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 110 P.3d 1042 (2005) for the proposition that, if 
homeowners make insufficient or unclear allegations of fraud without an affidavit, then the objection "may be overruled at trial after an evidentiary hearing." Thus, the Yalimaiwais claim that the court "misapplied the holding" in Aames because the allegations were "specific and discernible[,] and . . . are supported by an affidavit from a credible expert using public governmental records, entitled to judicial notice." We disagree. 
As discussed above, Petit's affidavit was not verified 
and failed to attach the documents it referenced. Accordingly, the Affidavit did not comply with the requirements of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Circuit Court did not err in deeming it inadmissible hearsay and declining to consider it. 
Furthermore, the Circuit Court correctly applied Aames. 
In that case, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ("HRS") §§ 501–118, "a mortgagor's right to 'impeach[ ] . . . any foreclosure proceeding' is expressly limited to the period before entry of a new certificate of title." 107 Hawai
'i at 101, 110 P.3d at 1048 (emphasis added) 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(quoting HRS § 501-118). Here, a new certificate of title was
 
issued to Menehune Sun on September 29, 2011. Thus, under Aames,
 the Yalimaiwais could not impeach the foreclosure proceeding six
 months later in their March 27, 2012 opposition to the MSJ. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in applying Aames when
 it granted Menehune Sun's MSJ.
 
The Yalimaiwais assert that they had a defense under
 
HRS § 667-4 because the trust5
 had "dissolved" and U.S. Bank
lacked authority as a trustee. In support, they cite Kekauoha-
Alisa v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co., 674 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 2012) and
 Silva v. Lopez, 5 Haw. 262 (Haw. Kingdom 1884) for the
 proposition that "even technical violations of foreclosure
 procedures void a subsequent foreclosure sale." 
In 
Kekauoha-Alisa, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the 
lender's failure to properly postpone a foreclosure sale after neglecting to make a "public announcement" of the postponement required avoidance of the sale. 674 F.3d at 1088. Similarly, in Silva, the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i determined 
that a foreclosure was invalid because the foreclosing entity scheduled the foreclosure sale a day earlier than provided for in the mortgage contract. 5 Haw. at 265. Although the Yalimaiwais acknowledge and discuss the fact of the Silva holding, they do not establish that the notice issues present in Silva or Kekauoha-Alisa occurred or apply here. Furthermore, the document the Yalimaiwais claim had the effect of "dissolving" the Trust is a Form 15 Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Suspension of Duty to File Reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This certification does not "dissolve" the certifying entity, but rather terminates its reporting obligations to the Securities Exchange Commission. See 
17 C.F.R. § 240.12g-4 (2007) & § 240.12h-3 (2011). Thus, the 
5
 In her affidavit, Petit stated that BNC Mortgage, Inc. sold the
Yalimaiwais' note to Lehman Brothers, who then sold it to Structured Asset
Investment Loan Trust 2005-8 through its servicer, JP Morgan Chase Bank and
trustee U.S. Bank. Petit and the Yalimaiwais refer to the Structured Asset
 Investment Loan Trust 2005-8 as "the Trust." 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Yalimaiwais' argument fails.6
 
The Yalimaiwais also appear to contend that Menehune
 
Sun lacked standing to initiate the ejectment action and claim
 
that "[l]ack of standing should overcome the 'innocent purchaser'
 theory, since standing is more than a technical issue or
 violation of the statute regarding non-judicial foreclosures." 
In support, the Yalimaiwais cite Cnty. of Kauai ex rel. Nakazawa
 v. Baptiste, 115 Hawai
'i 15, 165 P.3d 916 (2007), Sierra Club v. 
Dept. of Transp., 115 Hawai 'i 299, 167 P.3d 292 (2007), and Mottl 
v. Miyahara, 95 Hawai 'i 381, 23 P.3d 716 (2001). However, this 
argument also lacks merit. 
As discussed above, the Circuit Court correctly
 
determined that Petit's affidavit was inadmissible hearsay, so it
 did not err in declining to consider it. And Menehune Sun
 presented the necessary evidence to prevail in its MSJ.
 Furthermore, although Baptiste, Sierra Club, and Mottl concern
 standing requirements, the Yalimaiwais do not explain how these
 cases apply or are analogous to the instant case. Therefore, the
 Yalimaiwais' citation of those cases is unpersuasive, and their
 arguments fail.
 
(3) Finally, the Yalimaiwais argue that the Circuit
 
Court abused its discretion when it did not grant their motion
 for reconsideration and set aside the summary judgment because
 U.S. Bank and JP Morgan Chase did not have the authority to
 foreclose on the Property. The Yalimaiwais cite Deutsche Bank
 Nat'l Trust Co. v. Williams, Civ. No. 11-00632 JMS/RLP, 2012 WL
 1081174 (D. Haw. Mar. 29, 2012) as involving a situation where a
 court correctly dismissed a foreclosure because "the underlying
 documents, exactly as in this case at bar, revealed a break in
 the chain of title between the original mortgagee and the
 foreclosing entity." We disagree.
 
6
 The U.S. District Court of the District of Hawaii has commented on
 
Silva's limited applicability in interpreting HRS § 667-5.  See Bald v. Wells
 
Fargo Bank, Civ. No. 13-00135 SOM/KSC, 2013 WL 3864449, at *5 (D. Haw. July
25, 2013) (holding that Silva is not persuasive authority in interpreting HRS
§ 667-5 because it was "decided many decades before the Hawaii Legislature
substantially revised Hawaii's nonjudicial foreclosure statute in 2008. The
 
language in . . . Silva was therefore available to the Hawaii Legislature for
inclusion or paraphrasing in any statute").

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Yalimaiwais' reliance on Williams is misplaced. In
 
Williams, the defendant-mortgagors challenged Deutsche Bank's
 
standing in a judicial foreclosure action. 2012 WL 1081174, at
 *4. Additionally, the assignor in Williams was in bankruptcy
 liquidation on the day of the assignment. Id. at *3-4. Here,
 
however, the Yalimaiwais challenge a nonjudicial foreclosure. 
Furthermore, as discussed above, the document that the
 Yalimaiwais claim "dissolved" the trust instead terminated the
 issuer's registration and suspended its duties to report. 
Accordingly, Williams is inapposite. See Lizza v. Deutsche Bank
 
Nat'l Trust Co., 1 F. Supp. 3d 1106, 1117 (D. Haw. 2014).
 
The Yalimaiwais cite In re Custody of Ayala, 800 N.E.2d
 
524 (Ill. App. 2003) (citing Sarkissian v. Chicago Bd. of Educ.,
 776 N.E.2d 195 (Ill. 2002)), for the proposition that
 "[c]onsiderations of timeliness and due-diligence do not apply
 where the movant seeks to vacate an order it alleges is void."
7
 
In Ayala, the Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the
 trial court abused its discretion when it found a motion to
 vacate void orders to be untimely. Id. at 534. Here, however,
 
the Circuit Court did not find that the Yalimaiwais' Rule 60(b)
 motion was untimely, but it instead concluded, as it had
 determined earlier, that the Yalimaiwais could not challenge the
 foreclosure under Aames. Therefore, the Circuit Court did not
 abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion.
8
 
We are also unpersuaded by the Yalimaiwais' contention 
that U.S. Bank did not have standing to foreclose under Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai
'i 474, 918 P.2d 1130 (1996), for Menehune Sun 
7
 Citing Calasa v. Greenwell, 2 Haw. App. 395, 397, 633 P.2d 553,
555 (1981), the Yalimaiwais similarly appear to argue that their motion was
allowed under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). In Calasa, however, this court held that
there was "no time limit on an attack on a judgment as void." Id. at 398, 633
P.2d at 555. Here, the timeliness of the motion was not an issue. Thus,
Calasa is inapposite.
 
8
 The Yalimaiwais appear to cite Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai' i 42, 55,
169 P.3d 994, 1007 (App. 2007), for the proposition that they warrant
equitable relief. The Yalimaiwais' argument lacks merit, however, as they do
not demonstrate how the circumstances in Porter apply to the instant case, nor
do they explain their claim that there were no other remedies at law availableto them at the time of the proceedings. Indeed, the Circuit Court noted thatthe Yalimaiwais' stipulated to dismiss with prejudice their claims againstMenehune Sun, JP Morgan Chase Bank, and U.S. Bank in another lawsuit infederal court. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
and not U.S. Bank is the plaintiff in this case. And, as 
discussed above, Menehune Sun also provided the documentation necessary for granting summary judgment on the ejectment action. Significantly, the document the Yalimaiwais claim to be a "title abstract" is, in fact, a search of public records on the State of Hawai
'i Department of Land and Natural Resources website, which 
utilized the search term "Yalimaiwai Michelle." Yet, as Menehune Sun points out in its answering brief, a search under that name would not return a result containing the assignment because "Yalimaiwai Michelle" is neither the grantor MERS nor the grantee U.S. Bank, N.A. Menehune Sun's standing is established by the
 Assignment of Mortgage that Menehune Sun attached as an exhibit
 to its MSJ. Thus, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 in denying the Yalimaiwais' Rule 60(b) motion.
 
Therefore, the Order Granting Plaintiff Menehune Sun
 
LLC's Motion For Summary Judgment Filed Herein On February 3,
 2012, filed on May 2, 2012; the Judgment Granting Plaintiff
 Menehune Sun LLC's Motion For Summary Judgment Filed Herein On
 February 3, 2012, And For Possession, filed on May 2, 2012; and
 the Writ Of Possession, filed May 2, 2012, all of which were
 entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are affirmed.
