Amend Order Filed On April 10, 2012, Or In The Alternative,
 
Motion For Stay Pending Appeal Filed On April 12, 2012," entered
 
1
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  The
 
circuit court entered judgment in favor of Appellant-Appellee
 
Ross T. Nishi (Nishi).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. DOE Grievance Proceedings
 On November 20, 2008, the DOE informed Nishi that he
 
was being terminated effective December 1, 2008. 
Pursuant to the
 
DOE School Code Procedure (DOE Procedure), on November 25, 2008,
 
Nishi filed a complaint to the DOE contesting his termination. 
The DOE acknowledged Nishi's grievance and informed him it would
 
arrange for a hearing.
 
The DOE designated a hearing officer, who conducted a
 
hearing over three days in late 2008 through early 2009. The
 
record indicates the hearing officer drafted a decision, dated
 
March 17, 2009, concluding Nishi was terminated without proper
 
cause and recommending Nishi's reinstatement. The record also
 
indicates the DOE terminated the hearing officer's employment on
 
March 19, 2009, the day after she submitted her drafted decision. 
The DOE then informed Nishi the hearing officer had not produced
 
a final decision before the end of her employment, and it
 
assigned a second hearing officer to Nishi's grievance.
 
On June 15, 2009, the second hearing officer issued a
 
decision denying Nishi's grievance and concluding the DOE "had
 
just and proper cause to terminate [Nishi] from employment." The
 
hearing officer based her decision on her review of the record
 
submitted in connection with the hearing conducted by the first
 
hearing officer. She did not consider or review the March 17,
 
2009 document the first hearing officer had submitted.
 
On June 19, 2009, Nishi appealed the grievance
 
decision. On July 6, 2009, the DOE affirmed the grievance

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
decision upholding Nishi's termination, and it informed Nishi of
 
his right to appeal the decision to the Chairperson of the Board
 
of Education (BOE).
 
B. BOE Appeal
 
As set forth in the DOE Procedure, the BOE appoints a
 
three-member Grievance Advisory Committee (GAC) to conduct a
 hearing pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 91
 
(2012 Repl.). After conducting a hearing, the GAC submits to the
 
BOE Chairperson a written report which must include findings of
 
fact and a recommended disposition. The BOE makes a final
 
decision based on the GAC's report.
 
The GAC convened and heard Nishi's appeal on November
 
12, 2009. After reconvening to deliberate, the GAC submitted its
 
written recommendation to the BOE Chairperson on February 5,
 
2010. The GAC determined the DOE had "just cause" to terminate
 
Nishi, and it recommended the BOE confirm the DOE's decision to
 
terminate Nishi's employment.
 
On February 19, 2010, the BOE informed Nishi it had
 
reviewed the GAC's findings and recommendation, and the BOE
 
confirmed the DOE's decision.
 
C. Circuit Court Appeal
 
On November 22, 2010, Nishi filed a notice of appeal to
 
the circuit court. Nishi argued, among other things, that the
 BOE's decision was arbitrary and made upon unlawful procedure. 
The circuit court heard oral argument on November 17, 2011 and
 
orally ruled in Nishi's favor. On April 10, 2012, the circuit
 
court entered its Order ruling in Nishi's favor. The Order set
 
forth the circuit court's conclusions and stated, in pertinent
 
part:
 
[P]ursuant to Sec. 91-14(g)(3), HRS [(2012 Repl.)],
the Court finds, as a matter of law, that the Appellee DOE's
decision and appointment of a second Hearing Officer . . .
who subsequently restarted the grievance process and upheld
the [Nishi's] termination, was based on unlawful procedure
and violated the Appellee DOE's School Code Procedure 5512
and [Nishi's] Due Process Rights, pursuant to Section
91-14(g), HRS.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On April 12, 2012, the DOE filed a motion for
 
reconsideration and to amend the Order. The circuit court
 
entered its judgment on May 8, 2012 and an order denying the
 
DOE's motion for reconsideration on June 27, 2012. The DOE
 
timely appealed from the circuit court's Order, the judgment, and
 
the order denying reconsideration.2
 
On appeal, the DOE contends the circuit court erred in:
 (1) reversing the BOE's decision based on its
 
conclusion that the DOE's decision was made upon unlawful
 procedure pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g)(3);
 
(2) reversing the BOE's decision because it did not
 
find or conclude that the BOE's decision prejudiced Nishi's
 
substantial rights under HRS § 91-14(g)(6); and
 
(3) denying the DOE's motion for reconsideration
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"'Review of a decision made by a court upon its review
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal. The 
standard of review is one in which [the appellate] courtmust determine whether the court under review was right or
wrong in its decision.'" Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals of County 
of Hawaii, 109 Hawai' i 384, 391, 126 P.3d 1071, 1078 (2006)
(quoting Lanai Co., Inc. v. Land Use Comm'n, 105 Hawai' i 
296, 306-07, 97 P.3d 372, 382-83 (2004) (other citation
omitted)). The standards as set forth in HRS § 91-14(g)
(2012 Repl.) are applied to the agency's decision. Ka 
Pa�akai O Ka� aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 Hawai' i 31, 40, 7
P.3d 1068, 1077 (2000). HRS § 91-14(g) provides: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority orjurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) 
Affected by other error of law; or

"'An agency's findings are not clearly erroneous and
will be upheld if supported by reliable, probative and
substantial evidence unless the reviewing court is left witha firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been 
made.'" Poe v. Hawai� i Labor Relations Bd., 105 Hawai' i 97, 
100, 94 P.3d 652, 655 (2004) (quoting Kilauea Neighborhood Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229-30, 751 P.2d
1031, 1034 (1988)). "'[T]he courts may freely review an
agency's [COL].'" Lanai Co., 105 Hawai' i at 307, 97 P.3d at

71 Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990) (other citationomitted)). "Abuse is apparent when the discretion exercisedclearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules orprinciples of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant." Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawai' i 501,

standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea 
Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The DOE's primary argument on appeal is that the
 
circuit court misapplied HRS § 91-14(g)(3) by focusing its
 analysis on the actions of the employer, the DOE, rather than the
 
actions of the agency, the BOE.
 
In this case, the BOE's final decision expressly
 
confirmed the DOE's decision. See White v. Bd. of Educ., 54 Haw.
 
10, 501 P.2d 358 (1972) (BOE may adopt a report of a hearing
 officer appointed by the Board as its proposed final decision as
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
required by HRS Chapter 91). Moreover, the GAC heard testimony
 
from the first hearing officer and accepted her drafted decision
 
as one of Nishi's exhibits. Although the BOE's decision did not
 
address the propriety of the DOE's procedure, its confirmation of
 
the second hearing officer's decision demonstrates the BOE
 
concluded the decision was procedurally proper. The circuit
 
court did not err when it examined the validity of the DOE's
 
actions. 
We conclude the circuit court did not err when it
 
determined the second hearing officer's decision was made upon
 
unlawful procedure. Although the first hearing officer drafted a
 
decision in Nishi's favor, the DOE argued at the circuit court
 
that her decision was ineffective because it did not comply with
 
the DOE Procedure. The DOE Procedure states in part:
 
2. 	DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT/ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT
 . . . .
 c.	 Designates a hearing officer, who, in turn, arranges
for a hearing within five working days after receipt
of the grievance.
 . . . .
 (7) Renders a decision.
 (a) If the hearing officer sustains the appeal
of the aggrieved employee, s/he will inform the
aggrieved employee and all of the aggrieved
employee’s line supervisors, including the
Superintendent, in writing. The hearing
officer will prepare a letter of instructions
implementing his/her decision for the
signature of the Superintendent. This will
close the case.
 
The first hearing officer submitted to the assistant
 
superintendent a six-page document citing the above DOE Procedure
 
provision, stating her findings, and concluding Nishi was
 
terminated without proper cause. The record indicates the DOE
 
terminated her employment the day after she submitted the
 
document. Before her termination, she did not prepare a "letter
 
of instructions," nor did she inform Nishi of her decision in
 
writing. The record also contains conflicting evidence as to
 
whether she submitted her decision to the Superintendent. 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although the hearing officer stated she submitted her draft to
 
the Superintendent, the Superintendent informed Nishi she never
 
saw the draft.
 
Because of the above issues with the first hearing
 
officer's document, the DOE argued the document did not
 
constitute a "decision" under the DOE Procedure, and it appointed
 
the second hearing officer to complete the processing of Nishi's
 
grievance. The circuit court, however, concluded the second
 
hearing officer's appointment and decision "were not necessarily
 
to 'complete the processing' . . . , but to restart the entire
 
grievance process from the beginning under [DOE Procedure],
 
Subsection 2(c)." The record supports the circuit court's
 
conclusion. 
The record contains testimony from the first hearing
 
officer, who stated:
 
At about 7:45 [a.m.] on March 19, 2009, [the assistant
superintendent] informed me that my last day of employment
was March 20, 2009. I asked for the reason for this
 decision by the Superintendent[], I was informed that she
did not like the decision of the Nishi grievance. I asked
 [the assistant superintendent] to speak to the
Superintendent again about the case.
 
At about 3:40 p.m. on that day, March 19, 2009, [the assistant
superintendent] called me to his office to inform me that March
19, not March 20, 2009 was my last [day] of employment.
 
Other than the first hearing officer's testimony, there is no
 
other evidence in the record concerning the DOE's reason for
 
appointing a second hearing officer. Neither the DOE nor the BOE
 
made any findings addressing the propriety of the hearing
 
officers' substitution. Moreover, the DOE Procedure does not
 
contain any provisions addressing substitution of hearing
 
officers, and the agency did not indicate it had acted in
 
accordance with any existing or established procedure for
 
substituting hearing officers. Based on this record, we conclude
 
the circuit court did not err in concluding the BOE's decision
 
was made upon unlawful procedure under HRS § 91-14(g)(3) and
 
therefore it is unnecessary for us to address DOE's argument that
 
HRS § 91-14(g)(6) did not support the circuit court's decision. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The circuit court also did not abuse its discretion when it
 
denied the DOE's motion for reconsideration because the DOE
 
sought reconsideration solely on the grounds that the circuit
 
court misapplied HRS § 91-14(g)(3).
 
However, we conclude the circuit court erred when it
 
ordered Nishi's reinstatement because the procedure followed by
 
the second hearing officer did not comply with the applicable DOE
 
rules. Where the BOE's decision is invalidated because of
 
procedural errors in the grievance process, the "[p]roper
 
disposition was to remand to the [BOE] for further consideration
 
in accordance with proper procedure." White, 54 Haw. at 16, 501
 
P.2d at 363.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 We vacate the May 8, 2012 Judgment entered in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit, and we remand this case with instructions that the circuit court remand this case to the BOE 
for a new hearing consistent with this opinion.
