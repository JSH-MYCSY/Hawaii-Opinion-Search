GENESIS AYSON, Petitioner-Appellant
v.
 
ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COURTS,
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)
(CASE NO. 1DAA-12-0006)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Genesis Ayson (Ayson) appeals from 
the Amended Judgment on Appeal (Amended Judgment) entered on 
May 17, 2012, by the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).
1 The District Court affirmed the 
administrative revocation of Ayson's driver's license by Respondent-Appellee Administrative Director of the Courts, State of Hawai' i (Director), acting through a hearing officer of the 
Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office (ADLRO). 
On appeal, Ayson argues that: (1) due to alleged
 
deficiencies in the sworn statement submitted by an Intoxilyzer
 supervisor, the ADLRO lacked jurisdiction to issue the
 administrative review decision to revoke Ayson's license; (2) the
 intoxicant control roadblock at which Ayson's vehicle was stopped

failed to comply with statutory requirements set forth in HRS 
§§ 291E-19 and 291E-20 (2007); and (3) the hearing officer
 violated Ayson's due process rights by denying his jurisdictional
 challenge and his pre-hearing requests for subpoenas duces tecum
 without explanation. We affirm.
 
I.
 
We resolve the arguments Ayson raises on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. Ayson's argument that the ADLRO lacked 
jurisdiction to revoke his license due to the alleged deficiencies in the sworn statement submitted by Intoxylizer supervisor Richard Staszyn of the Honolulu Police Department (Officer Staszyn) is without merit. Ayson argues that Officer Staszyn's sworn statement did not comply with HRS § 291E­36(a)(2)(C) (2007). However, Officer Staszyn's sworn statement was not materially or substantively different from the language of the sworn statement that the supreme court found was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements in Park v. Tanaka, 75 Hawai' i 271, 278-79, 859 P.2d 917, 921 (1993). Based 
on our review of the record, we also reject Ayson's contention that Officer Staszyn was not an appropriate person to submit a sworn statement under HRS § 291E-36(a)(2) (2007). We conclude that Officer Staszyn's sworn statement complied with the requirements of HRS § 291E-36(a)(2).

2. Ayson contends that the intoxicant control
 
roadblock at which his vehicle was stopped was not established
 and operated in compliance with HRS §§ 291E-19 and 291E-20. We
 disagree. We conclude that the roadblock which led to Ayson's
 
2/ Moreover, even if Ayson could establish that Officer Staszyn's sworn
statement failed to comply with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2), he cites no authority for
the proposition that compliance with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2) is necessary for theDirector, acting through the ADLRO, to exercise jurisdiction over driver'slicense revocations. Indeed, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that a valid
test result establishing an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or propernotice of the implied consent laws is not a jurisdictional prerequisite for avalid license revocation hearing. See Dunaway v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 
108 Hawai' i 78, 84, 117 P.3d 109, 115 (2005); Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of the
Courts, 108 Hawai' i 31, 46, 116 P.3d 673, 688 (2005).

arrest for operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 
intoxicant complied with the requirements set forth in HRS 
§§ 291E-19 and 291E-20. 
3. We reject Ayson's claim that the hearing officer 
violated his due process rights. As we have already concluded, the hearing officer properly denied Ayson's jurisdictional challenge. The hearing officer also acted within her discretion in denying Ayson's pre-hearing requests for subpoenas duces tecum. See Simmons v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 88 Hawai' i 55, 
64-65, 961 P.2d 620, 629-30 (1998).
3 Ayson provides no support 
for his claim that his due process rights were violated by the hearing officer's failure to provide specific explanations for these denials, and we reject this claim.
