APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)
(CASE NO. 1DAA-12-0005)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Allen Kelley (Kelley) appeals from 
the Amended Judgment on Appeal (Amended Judgment) entered on May 
17, 2012, by the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).
1 The District Court affirmed the administrative 
revocation of Kelley's driver's license by Respondent-Appellee Administrative Director of the Courts, State of Hawai' i 
(Director), acting through a hearing officer of the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office (ADLRO). 
On appeal, Kelley argues that: (1) due to alleged
 
deficiencies in the sworn statement submitted by an Intoxilyzer
 supervisor, the ADLRO lacked jurisdiction to issue the
 administrative review decision to revoke Kelley's license; (2)
 the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Kelley's vehicle;

(3) the police lacked probable cause to arrest Kelley for driving
 
under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII); and (4) the hearing
 officer violated Kelley's due process rights by denying his
 jurisdictional challenge and his pre-hearing requests for
 subpoenas duces tecum without explanation. We affirm.
 
I.
 
We resolve the arguments Kelley raises on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. Kelley's argument that the ADLRO lacked 
jurisdiction to revoke his license due to the alleged deficiencies in the sworn statement submitted by Intoxylizer supervisor Woo Kang of the Honolulu Police Department (Officer Kang) is without merit. Kelley argues that Officer Kang's sworn statement did not comply with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2)(C) (2007). However, Officer Kang's sworn statement was not materially or substantively different from the language of the sworn statement that the supreme court found was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements in Park v. Tanaka, 75 Hawai' i 271, 278-79, 
859 P.2d 917, 921 (1993). Based on our review of the record, we also reject Kelley's contention that Officer Kang was not an appropriate person to submit a sworn statement under HRS § 291E­36(a)(2) (2007). We conclude that Officer Kang's sworn statement complied with the requirements of HRS § 291E-36(a)(2).

2. We conclude that the police had reasonable
 
suspicion to stop Kelley's vehicle. Before stopping Kelley's
 vehicle, Honolulu Police Department Officer Lei Ann Yamada
 (Officer Yamada) observed Kelley twice cross center line
 markings, including a double solid yellow line, that divided his
 
2/ Moreover, even if Kelley could establish that Officer Kang's sworn
statement failed to comply with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2), he cites no authority for
the proposition that compliance with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2) is necessary for theDirector, acting through the ADLRO, to exercise jurisdiction over driver'slicense revocations. Indeed, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that a valid
test result establishing an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or propernotice of the implied consent laws is not a jurisdictional prerequisite for avalid license revocation hearing. See Dunaway v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 
108 Hawai' i 78, 84, 117 P.3d 109, 115 (2005); Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of the
Courts, 108 Hawai' i 31, 46, 116 P.3d 673, 688 (2005).

lane from traffic traveling in the opposite direction. Kelley's
 
conduct was illegal and violated traffic laws. See HRS § 291C­
38(c)(8) (2007) and HRS § 291C-38(c)(2) (2007). Officer Yamada's
 observation of Kelley committing traffic violations was
 sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to effect a traffic
 stop of Kelley's vehicle. See State v. Powell, 61 Haw. 316, 320­
22, 603 P.2d 143, 147-48 (1979). 
3. We conclude that Officer Yamada had probable cause
 
to arrest Kelley for OVUII. In determining that there was
 probable cause for Kelley's OVUII arrest, the hearing officer
 cited Officer Yamada's observation of the traffic violations
 committed by Kelley; Officer Yamada's observation of several
 indications of intoxication, including the strong odor of an
 alcoholic-type beverage on Kelley's breath, his red and bloodshot
 eyes, and his slurred speech; and Kelley's alcohol content score
 of .178 on the Preliminary Alcohol Screening (PAS) test given to
 him. We reject Kelley's contention that the hearing officer
 erred in considering his PAS test score. HRS § 291E-11(f) (2007)
 clearly contemplates that PAS test results may be used in
 determining probable cause for an OVUII arrest. The evidence
 cited by the hearing officer was sufficient to establish probable
 cause to believe that Kelly operated his vehicle while under the
 influence of an intoxicant.
 
4. We reject Kelley's claim that the hearing officer 
violated his due process rights. As we have already concluded, the hearing officer properly denied Kelley's jurisdictional challenge. The hearing officer also acted within his discretion in denying Kelley's pre-hearing requests for subpoenas duces tecum. See Simmons v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 88 Hawai' i 55, 
64-65, 961 P.2d 620, 629-30 (1998).
