Appellee Hale Kipa, Inc.'s (Appellee Hale Kipa) October 1, 2012

Appellant Li's appeal from the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
May 8, 2012 judgment because the May 8, 2012 judgment does not 
satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), Rules 54(b) and 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original 
emphasis). The finding necessary for certification is "an express determination that there is no just reason for delay . . . for the entry of judgment." HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, when a party seeks appellate review of an order that adjudicates one or more but fewer than all of the claims, the "party cannot appeal from [the] circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification 
language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994) (emphasis 
added). 
Although the May 8, 2012 judgment enters judgment in
 
favor of Appellee Hale Kipa and against Appellant Li as to
 Appellant Li's counterclaim, the May 8, 2012 judgment does not
 resolve the multiple causes of action in Appellee Hale Kipa's
 complaint nor does the May 8, 2012 judgment contain an express
 finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on
 one or more but fewer than all claims pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 54(b). Instead, the May 8, 2012 judgment contains language
 remanding the remainder of this case to the district court for
 the adjudication of Appellee Hale Kipa's complaint. Under HRCP
 Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins, in order to
 be appealable, a judgment must either resolve all claims against
 all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification
 under HRCP Rule 54(b); otherwise, the judgment is not appealable.
 
Although the May 8, 2012 judgment contains a statement 
that there are no other claims by or against any parties in this matter, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained that 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1339 n.4 (emphasis 
added). Because the May 8, 2012 judgment does not resolve all 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
claims, does not dismiss all other claims, and does not contain
 
an express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of
 judgment on one or more but fewer than all claims pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 54(b), the May 8, 2012 judgment does not satisfy the
 requirements for an appealable judgment under HRS § 641-1(a),
 HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. 
Absent an appealable final judgment in this case, Appellant Li's
 appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction over appellate court
 case number CAAP-12-0000560. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Hale Kipa's
 
October 1, 2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 CAAP-12-0000560 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000560 is dismissed for lack
 of jurisdiction.
