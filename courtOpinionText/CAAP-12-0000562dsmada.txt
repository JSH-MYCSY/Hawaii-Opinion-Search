and that failure to pay would be called to the attention of the
 
court for such action as the court deemed proper, including
 dismissal of the appeal; and (4) thereafter, Appellant Pennington
 did not pay the filing fee, submit a motion to proceed in forma
 pauperis, or respond to the notice.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
