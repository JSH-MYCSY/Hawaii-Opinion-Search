I. BACKGROUND
 
Claimant was a stock clerk for Employer. 
On March 1,
 
2008, Claimant sustained an injury to his low back while bending
 
and lifting a case of rice. He filed a claim for workers'
 
compensation, and following a hearing held August 1, 2008, the
 
Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations
 
(Director) issued a decision concluding Claimant had suffered a
 
compensable work injury.
 
On October 28, 2009, the Director held a second hearing
 
to address several issues, including whether Claimant was
 
entitled to further medical treatment. The Director issued a
 
supplemental decision on December 2, 2009, concluding Claimant
 
was entitled to treatment from March 1, 2008 through October 28,
 
2009, the date of the hearing. The Director credited the reports
 
of Lorne Direnfeld, M.D. (Dr. Direnfeld) and Joseph Rogers, Ph.D.
 
(Dr. Rogers), who concluded Claimant's work injury had caused at
 
most a temporary aggravation of a pre-existing medical condition. 
Claimant appealed the supplemental decision to the
 
LIRAB on December 9, 2009. At the initial conference before the
 
LIRAB, Employer argued the Director erred in concluding Claimant
 
was entitled to receive treatment after October 7, 2008. 
Employer based its argument on a report by Dr. Direnfeld, who had
 
examined Claimant on October 7, 2008 and concluded that
 
Claimant's temporary aggravation had resolved by the time of that
 
evaluation. Consequently, the LIRAB's pretrial order stated that
 
one of the issues to be determined on the appeal was whether
 
Employer was liable for, and Claimant entitled to, treatment
 
after October 7, 2008.
 
The LIRAB issued its Decision and Order on May 22,
 
2012, stating its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The
 
conclusion of law (COL) at issue in this appeal, COL 1, states:
 
1. The [LIRAB] concludes the Employer may be liable
for, and Claimant entitled to [treatment] after October 7,
2008.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As the [LIRAB] has previously opined on Section
386-21, HRS, in Jochola v. Maui Economic Opportunity, Inc.
 
et al.; AB 2005-206(M) (September 25, 2008):
 
The entitlement of an injured worker to
receive [treatment] as the nature of the
injury requires for so long as reasonably
needed is one of the core components of
compensation. Simply because an injury
returns to pre-work injury status does not
necessarily mean that the duty to pay
compensation ends. Absent a showing of an
intervening or superseding event or cause
(see, for example, Diaz v. Oahu Sugar Co.,
 Ltd., 77 Haw. 152 (1994)), fraud (see
 
HRS § 386-98 (e)), or other appropriate
terminating event, there is a likelihood
that such obligation to provide
[treatment] will not terminate. No such
 terminating event has been shown in this
 case. However, a claimant’s entitlement
to such care, services, and supplies is
dependent upon all other requirements of
Chapter 386, HRS and the Hawaii Workers'
Compensation Medical Fee Schedule being
met, (e.g., such care, services, and
supplies, so long as reasonably needed and
as the nature of the injury requires, and
appropriately requested, reported,
authorized, and billed).
 
Accordingly, the [LIRAB] concludes that Claimant's
rights under Section 386-21, HRS, are not terminated.
Employer may be liable for, and Claimant may be entitled to
[treatment] after May 3, 2010 [sic], for her [sic] low back
injury consistent with and subject to the foregoing.
 
The LIRAB also concluded Claimant did not suffer permanent
 
disability or disfigurement and was not entitled to further
 
temporary total disability benefits after October 7, 2008.
 
Appellants filed a timely appeal from the LIRAB's
 
decision. 
On appeal, Appellants contend COL 1 is wrong.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of the LIRAB's decision is governed
by HRS § 91-14(g) (1993), which provides that:
 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4(2)In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3)Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4)Affected by other error of law; or
(5)Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or
(6)Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), [conclusions] are reviewable under
subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding
procedural defects are reviewable under subsection (3);
[findings] are reviewable under subsection (5); and an
agency's exercise of discretion is reviewable under
subsection (6)."  Potter v. Hawai# i Newspaper Agency, 89

erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision was

upheld if supported by reliable, probative and substantial
evidence unless the reviewing court is left with a firm and
definite conviction that a mistake has been made.'"  Poe v.

III.  DISCUSSION
HRS § 386-21 provides:
§386-21  Medical care, services, and supplies.  (a)
Immediately after a work injury sustained by an employee and so
long as reasonably needed the employer shall furnish to the
employee all [treatment]  as the nature of the injury
requires.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . . 
When a dispute exists between an employee and the
employer or the employer's insurer regarding the proposed
treatment plan or whether medical services should be
continued, the employee shall continue to receive essential
medical services prescribed by the treating physician
necessary to prevent deterioration of the employee's
condition or further injury until the director issues a
decision on whether the employee's medical treatment should
be continued. The director shall make a decision within
 thirty days of the filing of a dispute. If the director
determines that medical services pursuant to the treatment
plan should be or should have been discontinued, the
director shall designate the date after which medical
services for that treatment plan are denied. 
HRS § 386-21(a), (c)(2) (emphases added). 
We disagree with Appellants' argument that the LIRAB
 
lacked authority under HRS § 386-21 to order an employer to pay
 
for future medical treatment, unless a specific course of
 
treatment was anticipated and in dispute at the time of the
 
decision. Even if there is no present manifestation of symptoms,
 
it may be possible to predict that a claimant will require
 
medical treatment in the future as a result of a work injury. 
Barnes v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 2 P.3d 1180, 1184 (Cal.
 
2000). For that reason, courts construing statutory enactments
 
similar to HRS § 386-21 have concluded that employers may have
 
open-ended liability for medical treatment. Id. at 1185; Grover
 
v. Indus. Comm'n of Colorado, 759 P.2d 705, 711 (Colo. 1988) (providing string cite to other jurisdictions with similar 
holdings); Foote v. O'Neill Packing, 632 N.W.2d 313, 321 (Neb. 
2001) (same). This construction is consistent with our policy of 
liberally construing workers' compensation legislation. Flor v. 
Holguin, 94 Hawaif i 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391 (2000). Moreover, 
HRS § 386-21 does not place a limit on the value or duration of 
treatment an employer must furnish. 
However, the statute does require that the medical
 
treatment be "reasonably needed . . . as the nature of the injury
 
requires." HRS § 386-21(a). Therefore, even absent an
 
intervening cause, fraud, or other terminating event, an award of
 
future treatment cannot be affirmed without evidence in the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record supporting a determination that future treatment will be 
"reasonably needed" to relieve the claimant from the effects of 
the work injury. See, e.g., Barnes, 2 P.3d at 1185; Grover, 759 
P.2d at 711-12; Foote, 632 N.W.2d at 321 (requiring substantial evidence to support a determination that future treatment will be 
reasonably necessary). Construing workers' compensation laws in 
pari materia, we note the statutes provide an appropriate 
procedure for injured workers if no present need for treatment 
exists but a need later appears: HRS § 386-89 (1993) allows a 
claimant to reopen a case within eight years after the last 
payment of compensation or the rejection of a claim.
2 See 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 93 Hawaif i 
116, 130-32, 997 P.2d 42, 56-58 (concluding the LIRAB abused its 
2
 HRS § 386-89 states, in pertinent part:
 
§386-89 Reopening of cases; continuing jurisdiction of
director.
 
. . . .
 
(c) On the application of any party in interest,
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination of
fact related to the physical condition of the injured
employee, the director may, at any time prior to eight years
after date of the last payment of compensation, whether or
not a decision awarding compensation has been issued, or at
any time prior to eight years after the rejection of a
claim, review a compensation case and issue a decision which
may award, terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or
decrease compensation. No compensation case may be reviewed
oftener than once in six months and no case in which a claim
 has been rejected shall be reviewed more than once if on
such review the claim is again rejected. The decision shall
 not affect any compensation previously paid, except that an
increase of the compensation may be made effective from the
date of the injury, and if any part of the compensation due
or to become due is unpaid, a decrease of the compensation
may be made effective from the date of the injury, and any
payment made prior thereto in excess of such decreased
compensation shall be deducted from any unpaid compensation
in such manner and by such method as may be determined by
the director. In the event any such decision increases the
compensation in a case where the employee has received
damages from a third party pursuant to section 386-8 in
excess of compensation previously awarded, the amount of
such excess shall constitute a pro tanto satisfaction of the
amount of the additional compensation awarded. This
 subsection shall not apply when the employer's liability for
compensation has been discharged in whole by the payment of
a lump sum in accordance with section 386-54.

discretion by failing to reopen a claimant's case to consider
 
evidence of the claimant's need for proposed treatments).
 
In this case, we agree with Employer's argument that
 
there is no evidence in the record that future treatment was
 
"reasonably needed." The LIRAB made no factual findings that
 
specifically addressed Claimant's prognosis or his need for
 
future treatment. The last treatment plan in the record was
 
issued two and a half years before the LIRAB hearing, and its
 
sole recommended treatment was lumbar surgery. Claimant received
 
this surgery on June 15, 2010, and Claimant stated his condition
 
improved post-surgery. Nothing in Claimant's testimony at the
 
LIRAB hearing indicated he was receiving ongoing treatment or
 
that he had received a recommendation for further treatment. Our
 
review of the record found no post-surgery reports or treatment
 
plans indicating that the Claimant would require additional
 
treatment for his work injury. The only evidence in the record
 
regarding Claimant's need for treatment post-surgery is from Dr.
 
Direnfeld, who examined Claimant six months after the surgery. 
Dr. Direnfeld opined Claimant should have achieved maximum
 
medical benefit from the physical therapy treatment he had
 
received, and he concluded any need for additional treatment was
 
uncertain. 
The LIRAB specifically credited Dr. Direnfeld's opinion
 
that the lumbar surgery was to treat Claimant's pre-existing
 
condition and not for the work injury. The LIRAB also credited
 
Dr. Direnfeld's opinion that the work injury resulted in a
 
temporary aggravation of Claimant's pre-existing condition and
 
that the aggravation had resolved by the time of Dr. Direnfeld's
 
October 7, 2008 evaluation. On that basis, the LIRAB concluded
 
Claimant was no longer eligible for temporary disability benefits
 
and that Claimant's work injury did not result in permanent
 
disability or disfigurement. Although the right to treatment is
 
distinct from the right to disability benefits, see FEI
 
Installation, Inc. v. Williams, 214 S.W.3d 313, 317 (Ky. 2007)
 
(concluding a claimant may be entitled to future medical
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
treatment even if the work injury did not result in permanent
 
disability), the LIRAB's findings support our conclusion that
 
there was no showing that the temporary exacerbation of
 
Claimant's pre-existing condition resulted in the need for post-
surgery future medical treatment.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board's May 22, 2012 "Decision and
 
Order" and remand this case for further proceedings consistent
 
with this opinion.
