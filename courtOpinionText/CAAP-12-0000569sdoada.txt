IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM N. MEANS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
LAHAINA DIVISION
 
(Case No. 2DTA-11-00239)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant William N. Means (Means) appeals
 
from the May 14, 2012 Judgment entered by the District Court of
 
the Second Circuit, Lahaina Division (District Court).1
 
Means was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 219E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014).2
 
On appeal, Means contends the District Court erred by
 
(1) allowing the original complaint to be amended, over his
 
objection, to include the requisite mens rea for a violation of
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), (2) denying his motion to dismiss for
 
violation of Rule 48 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure
 
(HRPP), and (3) failing to adequately advise him of his rights,

 Although Means was originally charged with three other counts,
those charges were either dismissed or an acquittal was entered.

pursuant to Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995). The State concedes error on appeal and agrees that the 
judgment should be vacated and the case remanded for the District 
Court to dismiss without prejudice. 
After a careful review of the points raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the record and the applicable law,
 
we resolve Means's appeal as follows:
 
(1) The District Court did not err in allowing 
amendment of the OVUII charge to include the applicable mens rea. 
Although the State has conceded this point, the State's 
concession is not binding on this court. State v. Hoang, 93 
Hawai'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000). In State v. Kam, CAAP­
12-0000897, 2014 WL 6711498 (App. Nov. 26, 2014), this court held 
that 
the District Court had the discretion to permit the State to
amend the charges in the complaint before trial "if
substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced."
Here, Kam does not claim that her substantial rights were
prejudiced by the State's amendment of the OVLPSR-OVUII
charge and the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII
charge before trial to allege the required mens rea.
 
Kam at *5. Similarly, Means does not argue here that his
 
substantial rights were violated by the amended charge. 
Therefore, his first point of error is without merit.
 
2. Means next argues that the District Court erred,
 
on May 14, 2012 when it denied his renewed motion to dismiss with
 
prejudice for violation of his "Speedy Trial Rights." In this
 
motion, Means argued that more than six months had elapsed since
 
his arrest and that periods of time excludable under HRPP Rule 48
 
were insufficient to bring the delay under the 180-day time
 
limit. On appeal, the State concedes that 189 days elapsed
 
between Means's arrest and trial and argues that the judgment be
 
vacated and the case be remanded for dismissal without prejudice.
 
Although not bound by the State's concession, Hoang, 93 
Hawai'i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502, we agree that time excludable 
under HRPP Rule 48 would not bring the delay in this case under the 180-day time limit. Therefore, we agree with the parties

that the case should have been dismissed for violating HRPP Rule
 
48. However, in light of the District Court's decision that no 
violation occurred, it had no occasion to apply the factors 
mandated by State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 
(1981). 
Therefore, we will remand this case for the District 
Court to apply these factors and determine, in its discretion, whether the dismissal of the charge should be with or without 
prejudice. See State v. Hern, 133 Hawai
'i 59, 64, 323 P.3d 1241, 
1246 (App. 2013). 
The resolution of this issue makes it unnecessary to
 
reach Means's remaining issue.
 
Therefore, the May 14, 2012 Judgment entered by the
 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Lahaina Division is vacated
 and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
 
Summary Disposition Order.
