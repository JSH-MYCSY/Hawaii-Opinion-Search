IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN RE MARN FAMILY LITIGATION
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Master File No. 00-1-MFL 3RD)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises out of the sale of two contiguous 
parcels of real property located in Honolulu, commonly known as 
McCully Shopping Center (MSC) and the Lime Street Apartments 
(collectively, the Property). Appellee Liquidating Receiver Thomas E. Hayes (the Receiver) sold the Property on behalf of 
McCully Associates, a Hawai
'i Limited Partnership, to M Pocket 
Corporation (M Pocket). Appellant Alexander Y. Marn (Marn)1

 Although Marn also purports to appeal in his capacity as a limited
partner of McCully Associates and beneficiary and co-trustee of his trust, it
appears that all of his arguments on appeal are made in his individual
capacity.

challenges three post-judgment orders of the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit (Circuit Court):2
 
(1) the March 28, 2012 Order Granting Liquidating
 
Receiver's Thomas E. Hayes' Motion for Confirmation of Sale of
 
McCully Shopping Center and Lime Street Apartments, Filed 2/21/12
 
(Order Confirming Sale);
 
(2) the May 16, 2012 Order Granting Liquidating
 
Receiver's Motion For Reconsideration of Rule 54(b) Certification
 
of Order Granting Liquidating Receiver Thomas E. Hayes' Motion
 
for Confirmation of Sale of McCully Shopping Center and Lime
 
Street Apartments, Filed 2/21/12, Filed March 28, 2012, Filed
 
April 10, 2012 (Order Granting Reconsideration); and
 
(3) the June 7, 2012 Amended Order Granting
 
Liquidating Receiver's Motion for Confirmation of Sale of McCully
 
Shopping Center and Lime Street Apartments, Filed 2/21/12, Filed
 
March 28, 2012 (Amended Order).
 
Marn argues, in essence, that the Receiver abused his
 
discretion in selling the Property to M Pocket after declining
 
Marn's (arguably flawed) offers to purchase the Property and that
 
the Circuit Court erred in confirming the Receiver's sale.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Marn's appeal as follows:
 
The Receiver argues that this court does not have
 
jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the sale of the Property
 
to M Pocket and Marn's failure to obtain a stay of the Amended
 
Order moots any appeal. "[M]ootness is an issue of subject
 
matter jurisdiction. 'Whether a court possesses subject matter
 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo.'" State v.

Nakanelua, 134 Hawai 'i 489, 501, 345 P.3d 155, 167 (2015) 
(quoting Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai 'i 1, 4–5, 
193 P.3d 839, 842–43 (2008)). 
We thus address whether the mootness doctrine applies
 
to the instant case.
 
The general rule is that the right of a good faith
purchaser "to receive property acquired at a judicial
3
sale[ ] cannot be affected by the reversal of an order
ratifying the sale where a [supersedeas] bond has not been

filed[.]" Leisure Campground & Country Club Ltd.

Partnership v. Leisure Estates, 280 Md. 220, 223, 372 A.2d
595, 598 (1977). See also Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin.
Corp., 645 F.2d 333, 336 (5th Cir. 1981). The purpose of
the rule is to advance "the stability and productiveness of
judicial sales [.]" 47 Am.Jur.2d Judicial Sales § 55
 (1969). An exception to the rule is where the reversal is
based on jurisdictional grounds. Id. at § 54. The second
 
exception is where the purchaser is the mortgagee since he
"does not free himself from the underlying dispute to which
he is a party[.]" Leisure Campground, 280 Md. at 223, 372
 
A.2d at 598. See also 47 Am.Jur.2d Judicial Sales §§ 59–61.
 
City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. 130, 133, 748 P.2d 
812, 814 (1988); see also Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai 'i 307, 
313, 141 P.3d 480, 486 (2006) ("[T]he sale of the property prevents the appellate court from granting any effective 
relief."). "Moreover, 'it is appellant's burden to seek a stay 
if post-appeal transactions could render the appeal moot.'" Id. 
at 313, 141 P.3d at 486. 
Here, the sale of the Property was confirmed by the 
Circuit Court and closed on September 19, 2012. Marn filed motions before both the Circuit Court and the Intermediate Court 
of Appeals (ICA) seeking a supersedeas bond to stay the closing 
of the sale under Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
62(d), and both the Circuit Court and the ICA denied his motions. 
Thus, Marn did not obtain a stay. 
3
 It is well established that a receiver's sale is a judicial sale.
See, e.g., Smith v. Pac. Heights Ry. Co., 17 Haw. 96, 98 (Haw. Terr. 1905)
(discussing the distinction between "strictly judicial sales, such as sales in
partition, guardianship, administration, receivership, foreclosure, admiralty,
etc.," and "strictly legal sales," such as foreclosures under power of sale).
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nevertheless, Marn argues that the sale to M Pocket
 
does not render the appeal moot because: (1) M Pocket expressly
 
agreed to take title to the Property subject to the pending
 
litigation; and (2) M Pocket was not a "bona fide purchaser" as
 
it had both actual and constructive notice of the pending
 
litigation. Marn contends that a stay or supersedeas bond was
 
not necessary to preserve the ICA's ability to grant him relief. 
In support of his first argument, Marn refers to a
 
provision in the Property Description, which was attached as
 
Exhibit A to the Limited Warranty Receiver's Deed, and which
 
states that the described premises are:
 
SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the following:
 
. . .

Professionals' Fees and Costs recorded May 18, 2005,
as Land Court Document No. 3270147; Receiver: Thomas
E. Hayes.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Notwithstanding this court's November 30, 2012 order
 
providing Marn (and the Receiver) an opportunity to further
 
address the effect of this provision, Marn fails to provide any
 
record citation to the referenced order, any other evidence in
 
the record concerning the particular proceedings referenced in
 
that order, or any evidence, argument, or authority supporting
 
his contention that this provision should be interpreted as
 
evidence that M Pocket agreed to take title to the Property
 
subject to the outcome of Marn's June 2012 appeal challenging the
 
Circuit Court's confirmation of the sale of the Property. 
Indeed, Sections 4.1(d), 4.2(d), and 6.1(a) of the Purchase and
 
Sale Agreement between the Receiver and M Pocket appear to
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
indicate that M Pocket understood that future appeals would not
 
affect the validity of the sale unless a stay was properly
 
obtained pending an appeal of the sale confirmation prior to
 
closing:
 
4.1 Seller's Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

representatives have proceeded in good faith and

Purchaser is, therefore, entitled to all of the
protections afforded by law. Accordingly, the
reversal or modification on appeal of the
authorization provided herein to consummate this
Agreement shall not affect the validity of the sale,
unless such authorization is duly stayed pending such
appeal prior to the Closing Date.

acknowledges that the reversal or modification on
appeal of the authorization provided herein to

duly stayed pending such appeal prior to the Closing
Date.

6.1 Closing.

a. Appeal. . . . [In] the event that there is

final disposition of said appeal or the final
disposition by the Court following remand by the
appellate court, whichever is later or in Seller's
sole discretion, cancel this Agreement at any time and
refund all Deposits made by Purchaser within five (5)
business days of Seller's notice of cancellation;
provided, however, that if a stay pending said appeal
is granted and Purchaser is not in default of this

Agreement, Purchaser shall have the option to cancel
this Agreement by written notice given no earlier than
thirty (30) calendar days and no later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the filing of the order granting
the stay and receive a refund of all Deposits made by
Purchaser within five (5) business days after Seller
receives such written notice.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Marn further argues that M Pocket was not a "bona fide 
purchaser" of the Property because it had both constructive and 
actual notice of the pending litigation, and thus Marn was not 
required to obtain a stay. The seminal Hawai 'i case dismissing 
an appeal as moot due to the sale of the subject property during the pendency of the appeal refers, however, to a "good faith 
purchaser." Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 
814.

In discussing the doctrine providing for dismissal of
 
5
appeals as moot when the subject property has been sold,  this
4 Several other cases have cited the "good faith purchaser" language
from Saje Ventures II in support of dismissing appeals as moot. See, e.g.,
Pac. Mortg. Investors, LLC v. Johnson, No. 29317, 2009 WL 1600864 (Haw. June
8, 2009) (order dismissing appeal as moot); Pac. Mortg. Investors, LLC v.
Johnson, No. 29760, 2009 WL 3970998 (App. Nov. 18, 2009) (order granting
motion to dismiss appeal as moot); City Bank v. Abad Artemio M. Abad Revocable
Trust Gloria P. Abad Revocable Trust, No. 27953, 2009 WL 5084083 at *4-6 (App.
Dec. 28, 2009) (SDO) (appeal dismissed as moot where appellants did not file a
supersedeas bond and obtain a court order staying the judgment confirming the
sale of the subject property foreclosure sale to "third-party purchasers").
 
5 Other jurisdictions have similarly protected the rights of good
faith purchasers at lawfully executed judicial sales, holding that such sales,
once confirmed and closed, render an appeal from the confirmation of the sale
moot absent a stay. See, e.g., Hazzard v. Westview Golf Club, Inc., 217 A.2d
217, 224-25 (Me. 1966) ("Where a judicial sale is untainted by fraud,
unfairness, collusion or mistake, public policy requires that its ratification
be final, and, unless the decree of confirmation be stayed by proper and
timely action, its consummation pending appeal in full compliance with the
terms of the decree, will be unassailable. And the appeal therefrom becomes
moot and subject to dismissal. . . . Public policy requires that the
ratification of a lawful judicial sale shall be final and conclusive, except
in cases of fraud or illegality, and that no judicial sale, when lawfully
made, be set aside except upon substantial grounds, for otherwise the public

defendant in a foreclosure action can seek to stay the enforcement of an order
of sale by submitting an undertaking in an amount fixed by the trial court to

order of confirmation, therefore, marks the point at which the sale becomes
absolute. After confirmation, the sale may be set aside only for grounds such
as fraud or mistake which would be sufficient to avoid such a sale between
 private parties. . . .Confirmation of the sale, therefore, is of critical
importance to the purchaser because it marks the point at which the court's
discretion to set aside the sale is exhausted. The purchaser should be able
to determine with certainty the order by which the sale is confirmed.")

propriety of the sale and the sale confirmation procedures . . . . [T]he final
order of confirmation . . . cures all such irregularities, misconduct, and
unfairness in the making of the sale, departures from the provisions of the
decree of sale, and errors in the decree and the proceedings under it.
Further, as we have previously stated, [i]n exercising its discretion in a
foreclosure action, the court must keep in mind that the primary purpose of
the judicial sale is to protect the interest of the mortgagor-debtor and to
promote a general policy which provides judicial sales with a certain degree
of finality. Therefore, the confirmation of a judicial sale cannot be set
aside except for fraud, mistake or some other cause, for which equity would
avoid a like mistake between private parties.") (internal citations, quotation
marks, and emphasis omitted, format altered).
 
6 Other sections from this authority provide guidance:
 
The reversal of a decree directing a judicial sale, on
account of an error or irregularities not going to the
jurisdiction, does not vitiate the title of one who, as a
stranger to the proceeding, has in good faith purchased
property at the sale, either before an appeal or writ of
error or pending the same without supersedeas. This
 principle advances the stability and productiveness of
judicial sales and the value of titles derived under them

that "[t]he purpose of the rule is to advance 'the stability and 
productiveness of judicial sales[.]'" Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. 
App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 814 (quoting 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales § 55 (1969)). We have also held that "[i]n judicial sales, 
the court is the vendor [and][t]he confirmation of sale is the 
equivalent of a valid contract of sale. Consequently, 
application of contract law is appropriate when determining 
whether or not to set aside a judicial sale[.]" First Hawaiian 
Bank v. Timothy, 96 Hawai
'i 348, 361, 31 P.3d 205, 218 (App. 
2001) (quoting First Trust Co. of Hilo v. Reinhardt, 3 Haw. App. 
589, 592, 655 P.2d 891, 893-94 (1982)). 
Generally, until a receivership court has confirmed a
sale by the receiver, the court has discretion to set the
sale aside if necessary to obtain the best possible price
for the property; however, after confirmation, a sale may be
set aside only for grounds such as fraud or mistake which
 
would be sufficient to avoid a sale between private parties.
 
65 Am. Jur. 2d Receivers § 333 (201) (emphasis added and footnote
 
omitted).
 
A court in equity has jurisdiction to set aside a sale after
confirmation whenever it is made to appear that the same was
made through mistake, inadvertence or improvidence, or on
the ground of fraud whereby an improper advantage was
obtained. It is similarly a ground for vacating a
confirmation that the purchaser and others agreed or
 
6(...continued)
and operates as well in the interests of the owners of the
property sold as for the protection of purchasers.
 
47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales § 20 (2006) (footnotes omitted).
 
Where available, the proper course for one considering
the order of sale to be erroneous is to appeal from it and,
by giving a supersedeas bond, prevent the title to the
property from being irretrievably transferred. . . .
The rule that in the absence of appropriate security
given on appeal the title of the purchaser will not be
defeated by a reversal has been applied also to an appeal
from an order confirming the sale.

combined to stifle competition at the auction and thereby
reduced the selling price of the property. . . . A
 
receiver's sale of property will not be set aside for
inadequacy of the price alone, in the absence of facts and
circumstances showing fraud or material irregularities.
Inadequacy of the sale price in connection with unfairness,
injustice, or inequity in making the sale is sufficient to
justify the court in setting aside an order of confirmation
even where the purchaser has acted in good faith.
 
65 Am. Jur. 2d Receivers § 334 (2011) (emphases added and
 
footnotes omitted).
 
Hawai'i courts have consistently held that the circuit 
court's authority to confirm judicial sales is a matter of 
equitable discretion, and that "[i]n exercising its discretion, 
the 'court should act in the interest of fairness and prudence, 
and with a just regard to the rights of all concerned and the 
stability of judicial sales.'" Sugarman v. Kapu, 104 Hawai 'i 
119, 124, 85 P.3d 644, 649 (2000); See also Industry Mortg. Co., L.P. v. Smith, 94 Hawai
'i 502, 510, 17 P.3d 851, 859 (App. 2001); 
Brent v. Staveris Dev. Corp., 7 Haw. App. 40, 45, 741 P.2d 722, 726 (1987); Hoge v. Kane, 4 Haw. App. 533, 540, 670 P.2d 36, 40 
(1983). 
In the instant case, Marn conflates the "good faith
 
purchaser" requirement for judicial sales with the ability of a
 
purchaser in a non-judicial real property transaction to assert a
 
defense of being a "bona fide purchaser" who takes title free of
 
third party claims, such as fraudulent transfers claims. In the
 
non-judicial context, "bona fide purchaser" protection from
 
third-party claims generally requires that the purchaser buys the
 
property in good faith for value and without notice of any title
 
defects or competing claims to the property.
7 The two California

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cases Marn cites containing the "bona fide purchaser" language
 
did not involve judicial sales, but pertained instead to
 
competing claims to title based on recordation in title systems. 
Marn points to no precedent supporting his contention that this
 
"bona fide purchaser" standard is applicable in the context of a
 
judicial sale. Indeed, virtually every purchaser of a property
 
in a judicial sale has notice of the pending litigation which, if
 
we adopted Marn's argument, would leave virtually every judicial
 
sale unsettled, even absent a stay pending appeal. This result
 
would be completely contrary to the policy of advancing the
 
stability and productiveness of judicial sales.8

consideration without notice has a good title, although the purchaser of one
who had obtained the conveyance by fraud.") (quoting Jackson v. Walsh, 14
Johns. 407, 415 (N.Y. 1817)); Keawe v. Parker, 6 Haw. 489, 496 (Haw. Kingdom
1884) ("If the defendants are bona fide purchasers, without notice of the
claim of [competing claimant], they are protected, according to well settled
principles and by the statutes of this Kingdom."); Christian, by Holt, v.
Waialua Agric. Co., 33 Haw. 34, 54 (Haw. Terr. 1934) ("[I]f a second
purchaser, for value and without notice, purchases from a first purchaser, who
is charged with notice, he thereby becomes a bona fide purchaser, and is
entitled to protection.").
 
8 In the bankruptcy context, federal courts have similarly
interpreted the "good faith" requirement from former Bankruptcy Rule 805,
which has been codified in part at 11 U.S.C. § 363(m). Former Bankruptcy Rule
805 provided in pertinent part:
 
Unless an order approving a sale of property . . . is
stayed pending appeal, the sale to a good faith
 
purchaser . . . shall not be affected by the reversal
or modification of such order on appeal, whether or
not the purchaser . . . knows of the pendency of the
appeal.
Bankr.R. 805 (as amended, 1976; repealed 1983) (emphasis
supplied). The Advisory Committee Note to the 1976
amendments adding this language to former Bankruptcy Rule
805 described it as "declaratory of existing case law." See
 
Vista Del Mar Assocs., 181 B.R. at 424.
 
In re Thomas, 287 B.R. 782, 784 n.1 (9th Cir. B.A.P. 2002). "'Good faith' is
 a factual determination to be reviewed for clear error and can be defeated by
fraud, collusion between the purchaser and other bidders or the trustee, or an
attempt to take grossly unfair advantage of other bidders." Id. at 785

10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Marn does not allege that the sale to M Pocket involved
 
any mistake, fraud, or illegality, only that M Pocket had both
 
actual and constructive notice of the pending litigation relating
 
to the Property. As discussed above, this notice does not affect
 
M Pocket's status as a "good faith purchaser" for purposes of
 
determining whether the sale renders this appeal moot. See also
 
47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales § 23 (2006) ("The fact that a
 purchaser at a judicial sale has notice merely of a contemplated
 
appeal from the decree directing the sale does not deprive such
 
8(...continued)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit discussed
 
the policy behind former Bankruptcy Rule 805:

 
Former Bankruptcy Rule 805 . . . expresses a policy of
finality of foreclosure sales absent a stay. 
In
 
interpreting Rule 805, we have held that the sale of
property of a bankrupt's estate to a good faith purchaser
will not be affected unless the bankrupt obtained a stay of
the order approving the sale.
The primary goal of Rule 805 is to protect the
interest of a good faith purchaser, third party or
otherwise, of the property unless the order approving a sale
is stayed pending appeal.
 . . . 
Neither Bankruptcy Rule 805 nor the accompanying committee
notes define "good faith purchaser." See L. King, 2 Collier
on Bankruptcy, ¶ 363.13 (15th Ed. 1985) ("No definition of
good faith is attempted in the Code.") Lack of good faith,
however, is determined by fraudulent conduct during the sale
proceedings. In re Exennium, 715 F.2d at 1404-05.
The requirement that a purchaser act in good faith, of
course, speaks to the integrity of his conduct in the
course of the sale proceedings. Typically, the
misconduct that would destroy a purchaser's good faith
status at a judicial sale involves fraud, collusion
between the purchaser and other bidders or the
trustee, or an attempt to take grossly unfair
advantage of other bidders.

Ltd.), 37 B.R. 239, 243 (Bankr. 9th Cir. 1984) quoting In Re

purchaser of the status of a purchaser in good faith.") (footnote
 
omitted).
 
Moreover, neither of the two exceptions set forth in
 
Saje Ventures II apply, as Marn does not request reversal of the
 
orders based on jurisdictional grounds and M Pocket was not a
 
mortgagee. See Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. at 133, 748 P.2d at
 
814 ("An exception to the rule is where the reversal is based on
 jurisdictional grounds. The second exception is where the
 
purchaser is the mortgagee[.]") (citations omitted).
 
Therefore, like in Saje Ventures II,
 
the purchaser of the Property was [M Pocket], a third party
not involved in the case. There is nothing in the record to
indicate that [M Pocket] was not a good faith purchaser.
There was no stay of the execution of the confirmation order
and the sale of the Property has been closed. The grounds
upon which [Marn] seek[s] reversal of the confirmation order
are not jurisdictional in nature. Thus, even if this court
were to reverse the [C]ircuit [C]ourt's confirmation order,
the reversal would not affect the closed sale to [M Pocket].
 
Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 814-15. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the mootness doctrine applies to
 
this appeal.
 
Finally, we consider whether an exception precludes the
 
doctrine's application. The supreme court 
has explicitly recognized two exceptions to the mootness
doctrine: (1) the "capable of repetition, yet evading
review" exception [CRER exception]; and (2) the publicinterest exception. See Doe v. Doe, 116 Hawai' i 323, 327
n.4, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 n.4 (2007) (noting the public
interest and CRER exceptions are "separate and distinct").Additionally, although never explicitly adopted by thiscourt, the ICA, in In re Doe, 81 Hawai' i 91, 912 P.2d 588
(App. 1996), adopted and applied another mootnessexception—the "collateral consequences" exception[.]

843 (2008). 
The Receiver contends, and Marn does not dispute, that 
none of these exceptions apply to the instant case. In an appeal 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from a post-judgment order in a judicial foreclosure action where
 
the defendants-appellants had not filed a supersedeas bond or
 
obtained a stay of the judgment confirming the sales, this court
 
held that none of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine
 
applied:
 
The CRER exception to the mootness doctrine does not appear
to apply to the instant case because the instant case would
not evade review but for the fact that the Abad Defendants
 chose not to file a supersedeas bond. Therefore, the CRER
exception to the mootness doctrine does not apply to the
instant case.
 
With regard to the public interest exception, the
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained that, "[w]hen
analyzing the public interest exception, this courtlooks to (1) the public or private nature of thequestion presented, (2) the desirability of anauthoritative determination for future guidance ofpublic officers, and (3) the likelihood of futurerecurrence of the question." Lethem, 119 Hawai' i at 
6–7, 193 P.3d at 844–45 (citation, internal quotationmarks, and brackets omitted). The public interestexception to the mootness doctrine does not appear toapply to the instant case because (1) a foreclosurecase arises out of a private contract between partiesthat does not involve the government, and, thus, aforeclosure is more of a dispute of a private naturerather than a public nature, (2) an authoritativedetermination for future guidance already existswithin the holding in Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. at132, 748 P.2d at 814, and (3) the questions within theinstant case will recur only when parties choose notto file a supersedeas bond to stay the circuit court'sruling pending appeal. Therefore, the public interestexception to the mootness doctrine does not appear toapply to the instant case. 
With regard to the collateral consequences exception, the
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has "adopted the collateral
consequences exception to the mootness doctrine in casesinvolving domestic violence TROs where there is a reasonablepossibility that prejudicial collateral consequences willoccur as a result of the entry of the TRO." Lethem, 119 
Hawai'i at 9–10, 193 P.3d at 847–48 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The collateral consequences exception tothe mootness doctrine does not apply to the instant casebecause the instant case does not involve domestic violence or a temporary restraining order. Furthermore, the AbadDefendants could have avoided any prejudicial collateralconsequences if they filed a supersedeas bond to stay thecircuit court's ruling pending this appeal. Therefore, the 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
collateral consequences exception to the mootness doctrine
does not apply to the instant case.
 
City Bank v. Abad Artemio M. Abad Revocable Trust Gloria P. Abad
 
Revocable Trust, No. 27953, 2009 WL 5084083 at *5 (Haw. App. Dec.
 
28, 2009) (SDO).
 
Similarly in the instant case, the CRER exception does
 
not apply "because the instant case would not evade review but
 
for the fact that [Marn failed] to file a supersedeas bond." Id. 
The public interest exception does not apply because the receiver
 sale in this case 
is more of a dispute of a private nature rather than a
public nature, . . . an authoritative determination for
future guidance already exists within the holding in Saje
Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. at 132, 748 P.2d at 814, and . . .
the questions within the instant case will recur only when
parties [fail] to file a supersedeas bond to stay the
circuit court's ruling pending appeal.
 
Id. Marn does not argue that the collateral consequences
 
exception applies and it clearly does not. As no exception to
 
the mootness doctrine applies to this case, we dismiss this
 
appeal as moot.
