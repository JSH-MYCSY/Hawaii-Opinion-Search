NAKAMURA, CHIEF JUDGE, AND FOLEY AND GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, C.J.
 
A police officer cited Defendant-Appellee Manaiakalani
 
N.K. Kalua (Kalua) for: (1) the non-criminal traffic infraction
 
of speeding for driving 71 miles per hour (mph) in a 55 mph zone;
 and (2) the criminal offense of excessive speeding for driving 73
 mph in a 40 mph zone.
1 The two citations were based on the
 
police officer's radar speed readings while Kalua traveled
 
1As relevant to this appeal, a person commits the crime of excessive
speeding by exceeding the applicable speed limit by 30 miles per hour or more.

through different speed zones and the officer was attempting to
 
stop Kalua's vehicle. 
Kalua failed to answer the non-criminal speeding
 
infraction citation, and a default judgment was entered against
 him. Kalua failed to appear in court in response to the criminal
 excessive speeding citation, and a bench warrant was issued for
 his arrest. Prior to Kalua's appearance in court on the criminal
 excessive speeding charge, Kalua paid the $137.00 owed on the
 default judgment entered for his non-criminal speeding
 infraction. The District Court of the Third Circuit (District
 Court) subsequently dismissed the excessive speeding charge
 against Kalua, ruling that the entry of judgment on the non­criminal speeding infraction barred prosecution on the criminal
 excessive speeding offense.
2
 
The question presented by this appeal is whether the 
entry of judgment on Kalua's non-criminal speeding infraction barred Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai
'i (State) from 
prosecuting Kalua for the crime of excessive speeding. Based on Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291D-3(d) (2007), we hold that the answer to this question is no and that the District Court erred in dismissing the excessive speeding charge. 
The District Court relied on HRS § 701-109(2) (2014) in
 
concluding that the State was barred from prosecuting Kalua for
 the crime of excessive speeding. HRS § 701-109(2), in
 conjunction with HRS § 701-111(1)(b) (2014), generally bars the
 State from separately prosecuting a defendant for multiple
 offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same
 episode. See State v. Servantes, 72 Haw. 35, 37-39, 804 P.2d
 
1347, 1348-49 (1991). However, HRS § 291D-3(d) specifically
 provides that "[i]n no event shall section 701-109 preclude
 prosecution for a related criminal offense where a traffic
 infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been
 adjudicated pursuant to [HRS Chapter 291D]." Kalua's non­

criminal traffic infraction for speeding was adjudicated pursuant
 
to HRS Chapter 291D.
 
As explained in greater detail below, we conclude that
 
under the plain language of HRS § 291D-3(d), the default judgment
 entered against Kalua for the non-criminal speeding infraction
 did not preclude the State from prosecuting Kalua for the related
 criminal offense of excessive speeding. In reaching this
 conclusion, we reject the District Court's apparent view that HRS
 § 291D-3(d) does not apply if the traffic infraction is a lesser
 included non-criminal infraction of the related criminal offense. 
Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's order dismissing the
 excessive speeding charge against Kalua. 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 14, 2011, Hawai
'i County Police Officer T. 
Koyanagi (Officer Koyanagi) issued two citations to Kalua: (1) a "Notice of Traffic Infraction[]" for speeding, in violation of 
3
HRS § 291C-102(a)(1) (2007),  and a "Citation for Traffic
Crime[]" for excessive speeding, in violation of HRS 
§ 291C-105(a)(1) (2007).
4 The Notice of Traffic Infraction for
 
speeding noted that Officer Koyanagi measured the speed of
 Kalua's vehicle by radar, which showed that the vehicle was going
 71 mph in a 55 mph zone, and that Officer Koyanagi attempted to
 stop the vehicle, but was unable to do so until two miles later. 
The Citation for Traffic Crime for excessive speeding noted that
 Officer Koyanagi, by radar, measured Kalua's vehicle as going 73
 mph in a 40 mph zone. In the Citation for Traffic Crime, Officer
 Koyanagi wrote: "While attempting to stop [motor vehicle, it]
 continued to increase speed. [Motor vehicle] kept a steady speed
 of 73 mph while entering a 45 mph zone and pass [two] 40 mph
 
3HRS § 291C-102(a)(1) provides: "(a) A person violates this section if
the person drives: (1) A motor vehicle at a speed greater than the maximum
speed limit other than provided in section 291C-105[.]" (Format altered.)
 
4HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) provides: "(a) No person shall drive a motor
vehicle at a speed exceeding: (1) The applicable state or county speed limit
by thirty miles per hour or more[.]" (Format altered.)

signs. [Motor vehicle] finally stopped almost a mile later. 
Driver cited." 
The Notice of Traffic Infraction for speeding advised
 
Kalua that he "must answer this Notice within 21 calendar days,"
 that is, by November 5, 2011, or the court would enter default
 judgment against him for the amount of monetary assessments and
 fees indicated on the Notice, which was $137. The Citation for
 Traffic Crime for excessive speeding contained a summons and
 directed Kalua to appear in District Court on October 20, 2011,
 to answer the excessive speeding charge.
 
Kalua did not answer the Notice of Traffic Infraction
 
for speeding, and a default judgment in the amount of $137 was
 entered against him. Kalua paid the default judgment on November
 28, 2011. In the meantime, Kalua failed to appear in District
 Court on October 20, 2011, in response to the summons contained
 in the Citation for Traffic Crime for excessive speeding, and a
 bench warrant was issued for his arrest. The bench warrant was
 served on October 27, 2011. Kalua appeared in District Court for
 arraignment and plea on the excessive speeding charge on December
 1, 2011.
 
Kalua, represented by a deputy public defender,
 
subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the excessive speeding
 charge pursuant to HRS § 701-109(2) (Motion to Dismiss). The
 State filed an opposition to the motion. On April 19, 2012, the
 District Court held a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. At the
 hearing, the parties stipulated to the following facts, as
 proffered by Kalua's counsel, for purposes of the Motion to
 Dismiss:
 
The Defense would proffer that the evidence would show
on September 14th, 2011, at twenty two [sic][5] p.m., the
Defendant was traveling west on highway 200 in a 2001 Toyota
Tacoma. The citing Officer Koyanagi alleges in his citation
that he used a radar to measure Mr. -- the Defendant's speed
at a, quote, "steady speed of 73 miles per hour while
 
5The Citation for Traffic Crime issued to Kalua for excessive speeding
identifies the time of the citation as "1422" or 2:22 p.m.

entering a 45 mile per hour zone." And that -- and passed
two forty mile per hour signs.
 
Officer Koyanagi thereupon stopped Mr. Kalua, and
subsequently cited him under HRS 291C-102(a)(1) for going 71

miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone. He was also
 cited for excessive speeding under HRS 291C-105(a)(1) for
going 73 miles per hour in a 40 mile per hour zone. And
 given a summons to appear in the Hamakua District Court
[sic]
[6]  on October 20th, 2011, at 8:30.
 
On November 9th, 2011, the speeding violation went
into, quote, "default judgment," unquote, and Defendant paid

the $137 fine on November 28, 2011.
 
Ah, Your Honor, the only other proffer that the
Defense made is at no time was there a break in the
 
occurrence from the time that the Officer Koyanagi saw the
Defendant to the time the Defendant stopped and was cited.
And he was issued both tickets upon that stop.
 
After hearing arguments from counsel, the District
 
Court orally granted the Motion to Dismiss. On September 26,
 
2012, the District Court filed its "Amended Order Granting
 Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Excessive Speeding Charge Under HRS
 § 701-109(2)" (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss). The Order
 Granting Motion to Dismiss contained findings of fact based on
 the parties' factual stipulations. It also contained the
 following conclusions of law and order:
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. Under HRS §701-109(2) "a defendant shall
not be subject to separate trial[s] for multiple
offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the
same episode, if such offense[s] are known to the
appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the
commencement of the first trial and are within the
 jurisdiction of a single court[.]";
 
2. Defendant's conduct, to wit, the operation
of his vehicle at a speed in excess of the applicable
speed limit constituted a single episode;
 
3. While cognizant of the State's position
that HRS §701-109 does not preclude multiple
prosecutions where, as here, Defendant is issued a
"decriminalized" Speeding citation and also a
"criminal" Excessive Speeding citation, a review of
the material elements of both charges/citations are
essentially the same, with the Speeding citation

constituting a lesser included offense to the
charge/citation of Excessive Speeding. HRS §701­109(2); see State v. Fitzwater, 122 Haw. 354 (1981);
 
4. Defendant having been adjudicated on the
Speeding citation, the State is hereby barred from
prosecuting Defendant on the Excessive Speeding
citation.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the instant motion is
 
granted and the charge of Excessive Speeding is
dismissed with prejudice.
 
(Some brackets added.) The State challenges the Order Granting
 
Motion to Dismiss in its appeal.
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.

 
On appeal, the State argues that the District Court
 
erred in dismissing the excessive speeding charge with prejudice. 
Among other things, the State argues that the District Court
 erred in relying on HRS § 701-109(2) in dismissing the excessive
 speeding charge. We agree. We hold that pursuant to the plain
 language of HRS § 291D-3(d), the adjudication of Kalua's non­criminal speeding infraction under HRS Chapter 291D does not bar
 the State from prosecuting Kalua for the crime of excessive
 speeding.
 
II.
 
In the Order Granting Motion to Dismiss, the only
 
statutory authority cited by the District Court in support of its
 dismissal of the State's excessive speeding prosecution was HRS 
§ 701-109(2). We start with a discussion of that provision and
 how it has been interpreted. We then discuss the interplay
 between HRS § 701-109(2) and HRS § 291D-3(d).
 
A.
 
HRS § 701-109(2) is part of the Hawaii Penal Code, HRS
 
Chapters 701 through 713. HRS § 701-109(2) provides in relevant
 part:
 
[A] defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for
multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from
the same episode, if such offenses are known to the
appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the
 
6
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
commencement of the first trial and are within the
 
jurisdiction of a single court.
 
In Servantes, the supreme court construed HRS § 701­
7
109(2) in conjunction with HRS § 701-111(1)(b)  and held that the
State's conviction of Servantes on a misdemeanor drug charge

 
barred the State's subsequent prosecution of Servantes on felony
 
drug charges that arose out of the same episode. Servantes, 72
 
Haw. at 37-39, 804 P.2d at 1348-49. In support of its holding,
 the supreme court stated:
 
Section 701-109(2) reflects a policy that all charges
that arise under one episode be consolidated in one trial so
that a defendant need not face the expense and uncertainties
of multiple trials based on essentially the same episode.
Commentary on HRS § 701-109. Section 701-109(2) is designed
to prevent the State from harassing a defendant with
successive prosecutions where the State is dissatisfied with
the punishment previously ordered or where the State has
failed to convict the defendant. 
State v. Solomon,  61 Haw.
127, 596 P.2d 779 (1979); State v. Carroll, 63 Haw. 345,
351, 627 P.2d 776, 780 (1981).
 
Id. at 38, 804 P.2d at 1348.
 
B.
 
HRS § 291D-3(d) is part of HRS Chapter 291D, which
 
establishes procedures for adjudicating non-criminal traffic
 
infractions. The procedures established were in furtherance of
 the Legislature's finding that "further decriminalization of
 certain traffic offenses and streamlining of the handling of
 
7HRS § 701-111(1)(b) has not changed since the time relevant to the
Servantes decision. HRS § 701-111(1)(b) (2014) currently provides:
 
Although a prosecution is for a violation of a
different statutory provision or is based on different
facts, it is barred by a former prosecution under any of the
following circumstances:
 
(1)	 The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal
which has not subsequently been set aside or in
a conviction as defined in section 701-110(3)
and the subsequent prosecution is for:
 
. . . 
(b)	 Any offense for which the defendant should
have been tried on the first prosecution
under section 701-109 unless the court
 ordered a separate trial of the offense[.]

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
those traffic cases will achieve a more expeditious system for
 
the judicial processing of traffic infractions." HRS § 291D-1
 (2007).
8
 
The system established by HRS Chapter 291D gives a
 
person cited for a traffic infraction various options, including
 admitting the infraction and paying the amount assessed without
 appearing in court; denying the infraction and requesting a
 hearing to contest the infraction; and if the person loses at the
 hearing, requesting a trial conducted pursuant to the Hawaii
 Rules of Evidence and the rules of the district court. HRS 
§§ 291D-6, -7, -8, -13 (2007). The district court applies the
 preponderance-of-the-evidence standard of proof in determining
 whether the person cited committed the traffic infraction. HRS
 §§ 291D-8(a)(3), -13(b).
 
HRS § 291D-3(b) (2007) provides in relevant part:

 
(b) Where a defendant is charged with a traffic
infraction and the infraction is committed in the same
 
course of conduct as a criminal offense for which the
 offender is arrested or charged, the traffic infraction
shall be adjudicated pursuant to this chapter; provided that
the court may schedule any initial appearance, hearing, or
trial on the traffic infraction at the same date, time, and
place as the arraignment, hearing, or trial on the related
criminal offense.
 
HRS § 291D-3(c) (2007) establishes procedures for a trial on the
 
traffic infraction where a trial is also scheduled for a related
 criminal offense. 
8The system for adjudicating traffic infractions established by HRS
Chapter 291D was designed to: (1) "[e]liminate the long and tedious
arraignment proceeding for a majority of traffic matters"; (2) "[f]acilitate
and encourage the resolution of many traffic infractions through the payment
of a monetary assessment"; (3) speed the disposition of contested cases
through a hearing in which the rules of evidence will not apply and the court
will consider as evidence the notice of traffic infraction, applicable police
reports, and other relevant written material; (4) dispense in most cases with
the need for witnesses to be present, including law enforcement officers, and
the need for the participation of the prosecuting attorney; (5) allow for the
more efficient and effective use of judicial, prosecutorial, and law
enforcement resources; and (6) "[s]ave the taxpayers money and reduce their
frustration with the judicial system by simplifying the traffic court
process." HRS § 291D-1. 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 291D-3(d), which is the provision critical to
 
this appeal, provides: "In no event shall section 701-109
 
preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a
 traffic infraction committed in the same course of conduct has
 been adjudicated pursuant to this chapter." The obvious purpose
 of HRS § 291D-3(d) is to make clear that the procedures
 established for the expeditious and streamlined adjudication of
 non-criminal traffic infractions will not jeopardize or adversely
 affect the State's ability to pursue prosecution of crimes
 related to the non-criminal traffic infractions. Consistent with
 this purpose, the term "related criminal offense" as used in HRS
 § 291D-3(d) is broadly defined to mean "any criminal violation or
 crime, committed in the same course of conduct as a traffic
 infraction, for which the defendant is arrested or charged." HRS
 § 291D-2 (2007). HRS § 291D-3(d) eliminates any bar to criminal
 prosecution that could otherwise arise from the separate
 adjudication of non-criminal traffic infractions. 
III.
 
In resolving this appeal, we need not decide whether
 
and to what extent the adjudication of a non-criminal violation
 would bar a subsequent criminal prosecution under HRS § 701­109(2) and HRS § 701-111(1)(b). Even assuming arguendo that
 these provisions generally apply to the adjudication of non­criminal violations, HRS § 291D-3(d) precludes their application
 to bar criminal prosecution based on the adjudication of a non­criminal traffic infraction pursuant to HRS Chapter 291D. In
 this case, the District Court relied on HRS § 701-109(2) in
 concluding that the adjudication of Kalua's non-criminal speeding
 infraction pursuant to HRS Chapter 291D barred the State from
 prosecuting him on the criminal excessive speeding charge.
9 HRS
 
§ 291D-3(d), however, eliminates any bar to criminal prosecution
 
9Pursuant to the procedures set forth in HRS Chapter 291D, default
judgment was entered against Kalua based on his failure to answer the Notice
of Traffic Infraction for speeding within twenty-one days. See HRS § 291D­
7(d) and (e).
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that could otherwise arise from the application of HRS §
 
701-109(2). Under the plain language of HRS § 291D-3(d), the
 District Court erred in dismissing the State's excessive speeding
 charge.
10
 
IV.
 
The District Court apparently believed that the Supreme
 
Court's determination in Fitzwater that a speeding infraction is
 a lesser included non-criminal traffic infraction of the crime of
 excessive speeding somehow prevented the application of HRS 
§ 291D-3(d) to Kalua's excessive speeding prosecution.
11 Kalua
 
also argues that HRS § 291D-3(d) does not apply where the
 adjudicated traffic infraction is a "lesser included offense" of
 the crime being prosecuted. The District Court's apparent belief
 and Kalua's argument are without merit.
 
As noted, the term "related criminal offense" as used
 
in HRS § 291D-3(d) is broadly defined to mean "any criminal
 violation or crime, committed in the same course of conduct as a
 traffic infraction, for which the defendant is arrested or
 charged." See HRS § 291D-2. A criminal offense is clearly
 
committed in the same course of conduct as its lesser included
 non-criminal traffic infraction. Thus, HRS § 291D-3(d) plainly
 applies to permit prosecution of a criminal offense where the
 
10As noted, we need not decide whether and to what extent the
adjudication of a non-criminal violation would bar a subsequent criminal
prosecution under HRS § 701-109(2) and HRS § 701-111(1)(b). We observe,
however, that construing HRS § 701-109(2) and HRS § 701-111(1)(b) to bar a
subsequent criminal prosecution based on the adjudication of a prior non­criminal violation could lead to absurd and unjust results -- for example,
where a murder or other serious felony prosecution is barred by the prior
adjudication of a non-criminal violation based on the same conduct or arising
from the same episode. Although HRS § 291D-3(d) eliminates the issue for non­criminal traffic infractions, the Legislature may wish to clarify its intent
regarding the applicability of HRS § 701-109(2) and HRS § 701-111(1)(b) to
other non-criminal violations. 
11In Fitzwater,  the supreme court held that there was insufficient
evidence to support Fitzwater's conviction for the crime of excessivespeeding, but it remanded the case for entry of judgment on the "lesserincluded non-criminal traffic infraction" of speeding because there wassufficient evidence to establish that Fitzwater had committed the speedinginfraction.

adjudicated traffic infraction is a lesser included traffic
 
infraction of the charged crime.
 
V.
 
We reject Kalua's contention that the Double Jeopardy 
Clause bars the State from prosecuting the excessive speeding charge in this case.
12 "Double jeopardy protects individuals 
against: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense." State v. Higa, 79 Hawai
'i 1, 5 897 P.2d 928, 932 (1995). 
Collectively, the three double jeopardy protections prohibit two things: successive prosecutions and multiple punishments for the same offense. See Taylor v. Sherrill, 819 P.2d 921, 924 (Ariz. 
1991) (en banc); State v. Naydihor, 483 N.W.2d 253, 256 (Wis. Ct App. 1992). 
It is well settled that the double jeopardy protections
 
against successive prosecutions and multiple punishments only
 prohibit successive criminal prosecutions and multiple criminal
 punishments for the same offense. See Helvering v. Mitchell, 303
 
U.S. 391, 399 (1938) ("Congress may impose both a criminal and a
 civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for the
 double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or
 attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same
 offense."); Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997) ("The
 [Double Jeopardy] Clause protects only against the imposition of
 multiple criminal punishments for the same offense[.]"); Purcell
 v. United States, 594 A.2d 527, 529 (D.C. Ct. App. 1991) ("The
 Double Jeopardy Clause only prohibits successive criminal
 prosecutions or punishments for the same act. It does not bar a
 
12The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution provides that no person shall "be subject for the same offence to
be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb[.]" Similarly, Article I, Section 10of the Hawai' i Constitution provides that no person "shall . . . be subject
for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy[.]" 
11

criminal prosecution after a proceeding that results in a civil
 
sanction, or vice versa.").
 
Here, the adjudication of Kalua's non-criminal speeding
 
infraction was not a criminal prosecution, and the applicable 
sanctions for that infraction and the $137 default judgment he
 paid did not constitute a criminal punishment. Accordingly, the
 adjudication of Kalua's non-criminal speeding infraction did not
 trigger double jeopardy protections and did not bar his
 subsequent criminal prosecution for excessive speeding.
 
In determining whether a statutory scheme and the 
punishment imposed is civil or criminal in nature, courts first look to "'determine whether [the Legislature], in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.'" Tauese v. State Dept. 
of Labor and Indus. Relations, 113 Hawai
'i 1, 31, 147 P.3d 785, 
815 (2006) (quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248 (1980)); Taylor, 819 P.2d at 927; Purcell, 594 A.2d at 530; Naydihor, 483 N.W.2d at 258. It is clear that the Legislature intended the proceedings and the penalties imposed under HRS Chapter 291D to be labeled civil as opposed to criminal. Indeed, the Legislature's purpose in enacting HRS Chapter 291D was to further decriminalize various traffic offenses and streamline the processing of these infractions by eliminating criminal 
penalties13
 and basically restricting punishment for violations
to monetary assessments. See
 HRS § 291D-1; 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws
 
Act 214, § 1 at 365-66; HRS § 291D-3 (2007); HRS § 291D-9 (2007).
 
However, the Legislature's declaration that a violation 
is non-criminal does not end the inquiry. See Tauese, 113 
Hawai'i at 31, 147 P.3d at 815. Even when the Legislature's 
intention to establish a civil penalty is clear, courts must further inquire "'whether the statutory scheme was so punitive 
13Persons committing the decriminalized traffic infractions are not
subject to imprisonment. See HRS §§ 291D-3 (2007); HRS § 291D-9 (2007).

either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.'" Id.
 
(quoting Ward, 448 U.S. at 248-49). 
In Higa, 79 Hawai 'i at 6, 897 P.2d at 933, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court applied the principles enunciated in the United 
States Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989), in determining whether the penalties imposed in administrative driver's license revocation proceedings constituted criminal punishment for double jeopardy purposes. However, in Hudson, 522 U.S. at 96, the United States Supreme Court disavowed much of the method of analysis in Halper and reaffirmed its previously established analysis, and in Tauese, 113 Hawai
'i at 31-33, 147 P.3d at 815-17, the Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court applied an analysis consistent with Hudson.14 Accordingly, 
we apply the analysis used in Tauese and Hudson to determine whether the penalties imposed for a non-criminal speeding infraction under HRS Chapter 291D are so punitive that they "transform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty." Tauese, 113 Hawai
'i at 31-33, 147 P.3d at 
815-16 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).15 
In making this determination, courts have considered
 
seven factors: "(1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative
 
14In Hudson,  the United States Supreme Court disavowed in large part the
method of analysis used in 
Halper, reaffirmed "the previously established rule
exemplified in [Ward]," and considered the seven factors listed in Kennedy v.
Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69 (1963), in determining "whether thestatutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transformwhat was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty." Hudson,
522 U.S. at 96, 99-100, 104-05 (internal quotation marks, citations, andbrackets omitted). In Tauese, the Hawai' i Supreme Court cited Hudson, applied
the two-part inquiry set forth in Ward, and considered the seven factorsenunciated in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez in determining whetheradministrative penalties imposed for fraudulent insurance acts under Hawai' i's 
workers' compensation law constituted criminal penalties. Tauese, 113 Hawai' i

15We note that we would reach the same result under the Halper analysis
because the sanctions imposed for a non-criminal speeding infraction can beregarded as remedial -- to safeguard the public and to defray the costs to thegovernment of enforcing traffic regulations -- and not solely or predominatelyfor retribution or deterrence.

disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been
 
regarded as a punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on
 a finding of scienter; (4) whether its operation will promote the
 traditional aims of punishment-retribution and deterrence; (5)
 whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6)
 whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be
 connected is assignable for it; and (7) whether it appears
 excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned. Id.
 
at 32, 147 P.3d at 816 (brackets and internal quotation marks

These factors strongly support the conclusion that the 
sanctions imposed for a speeding infraction are not so punitive as to transform the civil remedy intended by the Legislature into a criminal punishment. A person who commits a speeding infraction is subject to the following sanctions: a monetary assessment of not more than $200 for a first violation, not more than $300 for a second violation committed within one year after the first violation, and not more than $500 for a third or subsequent violation committed within one year after the first violation; a $10 surcharge if the maximum speed limit is exceeded by more than ten miles per hour, which shall be deposited into the neurotrauma special fund; and additional monetary assessments for failure to pay a monetary assessment by the scheduled date or for costs related to issuance of a penal summons. See HRS 
§§ 291D-3, 291D-9, 291C-102 (2007), 291C-161 (2007 & Supp. 2014); State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai
'i 314, 320 n.12, 288 P.3d 788, 794 
n.12 (2012).16
 
16The court may impose community service in lieu of a monetary
assessment if a person claims an inability to pay. See HRS § 291D-9. If the
 
person fails to pay the assessment imposed or perform the community service,
the court is required to take action to impose restrictions on the person's
ability to obtain or renew a driver's license and to register and transfer a
motor vehicle. See HRS §§ 291D-9, 291D-10 (2007).

These sanctions do not involve an affirmative 
disability or restraint; monetary assessments, in particular, 
have not historically been regarded as punishment; no scienter is required; while the monetary assessments and other possible sanctions promote deterrence, "the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence may serve civil as well as criminal goals[,]" Tauese, 113 Hawai
'i at 
32, 147 P.3d at 816 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); exceeding the speed limit by less than 30 miles per hour is not a crime; the purposes of safeguarding the public, reducing accidents and injuries caused by speed limit violations, and defraying the costs to the government of enforcing speed limits are alternative purposes besides criminal punishment to which the sanctions can be assigned; and the sanctions are not excessive in relation to these alternative purposes. Accordingly, we conclude that the penalties imposed for a speeding infraction are not criminal penalties for double jeopardy purposes.

17We note that if the civil penalties imposed for non-criminal traffic
infractions were found to constitute criminal penalties, then the system
established by HRS Chapter 291D for adjudicating traffic infractions would be
unconstitutional because HRS Chapter 291D does not provide the safeguards
necessary for the imposition of criminal punishment. See HRS §§ 291D-8(a)(3),
291D-13(b) (imposing the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard of proof for
determining whether the person cited committed the traffic infraction). 
18Kalua's reliance on State v. Lessary, 75 Haw. 446, 865 P.2d 150
(1994), and 
Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990), is misplaced. Those cases 
analyzed the application of double jeopardy protections to the situation whereboth the prior and subsequent proceedings were criminal prosecutions. Theydid not address the threshold question presented here of whether a proceedingand the applicable penalties that the Legislature intended to be civil shouldbe viewed as criminal so as to invoke and necessitate double jeopardyprotections. Because we conclude that Kalua's speeding infraction was notcriminal in nature, the double jeopardy protections, and the analysis inLessary and Grady, do not apply. See Higa, 79 Hawai' i at 5-7, 897 P.2d at
932-34; Taylor, 819 P.2d at 925-26; Naydihor, 483 N.W.2d at 256-57; Purcell,594 A.2d at 528-29.
