SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Employer-Appellant
 
Attractions Hawaii ("Employer") and Insurance Carrier-Appellant
 
Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. appeal from the
 Decision and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 Appeals Board ("Board") on May 22, 2012 ("May 22, 2012 Decision &
 Order"). In an unappealed decision on March 12, 2009 (the
 "March 12, 2009 Shoulder Injury Decision"), the Director of Labor
 and Industrial Relations ("Director") had found Employer and
 Insurance Carrier (collectively, "Attractions") to be liable for
 Claimant-Appellee Keiko Mokiao's physical, right-shoulder injury,
 which arose out of a work-related incident occurring on May 18,
 2006 (the "May 18, 2006 Shoulder Injury"). This dispute relates
 to Mokiao's subsequent claim for psychological injuries that she
 alleges arose from the May 18, 2006 Shoulder Injury (the
 "April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim").

On appeal, Attractions asks this court to vacate the
 
Board's determination that Attractions is liable to Mokiao under
 
the April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim. Specifically,
 Attractions alleges that the Board erred in concluding that: (I)
 Attractions is liable for the psychological injury as a result
 of, or as a compensable consequence to, Mokiao's May 18, 2006
 
2/
Shoulder Injury;  (II) Attractions is liable to Mokiao for
medical care, services, and supplies for the psychological
 
3/
injury;  and that (III) the permanent partial disability ("PPD")
award it vacated4/ should be remanded.
 
Upon careful review of the record, the briefs submitted
 
by the parties, and the points made at oral argument, and having
 given due consideration to the arguments advanced, the issues
 raised, and the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 Attractions' points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
I.	 
The Board did not err in holding Attractions liable for

Mokiao's latent psychological injury.
 
In its first point of error, Attractions asks this
 
court to overturn COL 1, which states that Mokiao "sustained a
 
psychiatric injury as a result of, or compensable consequence to,
 the May 18, 2006 [S]houlder [I]njury." Attractions urges us to
 (re)interpret the evidence as to that point, yet we find that,
 notwithstanding Attractions' proffered alternative reading, the
 record contains sufficient evidence to support the Board's
 
1/(...continued)
"psychiatric" and "psychological" interchangeably in their briefing to this

court, and research reveals that other jurisdictions tend to prefer the
latter. For consistency, this opinion uses "psychological" throughout, but
this choice should not be construed as a statement about the correctness of
 each term.
 
2/
 In connection with this point of error, Attractions challenges the
May 22, 2012 Decision & Order's Findings of Fact ("FOFs") 13, 18, 20, 21, 22,
and 23 and Conclusion of Law ("COL") 1.
 
3/
 Specifically, Attractions challenges COL 2 in connection with this
point of error.
 
4/
 In its May 22, 2012 Decision & Order, the Board had determined
that the Director provided Attractions with insufficient notice that he would
determine Mokiao's percentage of PPD during a hearing on the April 14, 2009
Psychological Injury Claim, and it therefore vacated the Director's PPD
determination in a March 18, 2010 Decision (the "March 18, 2010 Psychological
Injury Decision") and remanded. Attractions challenges COL 3 in connection
with this point of error.
 
2
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
findings and conclusions as to COL 1. As such, the Board did not
 
5/
clearly err,  and Attractions' first point of error fails.
A.	 Latent workplace injuries are compensable
notwithstanding uncertainty as to a singular date of
manifestation.
 
Attractions asserts that the Board erred in finding in
 
FOF 21 and concluding in COL 1 that "the effects of [Mokiao]'s
 
psychiatric condition from the May 18, 2006 [S]houlder [I]njury
 manifested at the earliest by the second half of 2008 or at the
 latest by March 2009" for purposes of calculating the timeliness
 of Mokiao's April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim. 
Specifically, Attractions argues that Mokiao's April 14, 2009
 Psychological Injury Claim was untimely under HRS §§ 386–81,
6/
 
–827/ and claims that "without a more specific date of
 
manifestation and the clarification of the events that led to the
 manifestation, [Attractions has been] procedurally denied [its]
 right of due process to assert [its] defenses and/or positions." 
We disagree.
 
Under HRS §§ 386-82, "[t]he two-year statute of 
limitations for the filing of a workers' compensation claim begins to accrue when the claimant's injury becomes manifest . . . ." Hayashi v. Scott, Co., 93 Hawai
'i 8, 12, 994 P.2d 1054, 
1058 (2000) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). In Hawai 'i, the 
5/
 Under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2011), an
appeal taken from both FOFs and COLs that present mixed questions of fact and
law, such as COL 1 here, is reviewed for clear error. See Igawa v. Koa House 
Rest., 97 Hawai' i 402, 405–06, 38 P.3d 570, 573–74 (2001) (citations omitted). 
6/
 HRS § 386–81 (1993) sets forth the worker's duty to notify her
employer of a workplace accident: "No proceeding for compensation under this
chapter shall be maintained unless written notice of the injury has been given
to the employer as soon as practicable after the happening thereof."
 
7/
 HRS § 386–82 (1993) establishes the two-year time frame within
which a worker may file her workers' compensation claim, thereby putting the
employer on notice that the worker has suffered a possibly compensable injury:
 
The right to compensation under this chapter shall be
barred unless a written claim therefor is made to the director
 
of labor and industrial relations (1) within  two years after
 
the  date  at which the effects of the injury for which the
 
employee is entitled to compensation have become manifest
 
. . . .  The claim shall state in ordinary language the time,
place, nature, and cause of the injury.
 
(Emphasis added.)

effects of a workplace injury become manifest when "the claimant,
 
as a reasonable [person], should recognize the nature,
 seriousness and probable compensable character of his [or her]
 injury or disease." Demond v. Univ. of Haw., 54 Haw. 98, 104,
 
503 P.2d 434, 438 (1972) (quoting 3 Larson, Law of Workmen's
 Compensation § 84.20 (1971))); see also Haw. Rev. Stat. § 386-82
 (requiring claimants to describe the "nature . . . of the
 injury," which a claimant can only do when he or she is aware
 that a possibly compensible injury exists). 
Logically, however, some worker-claimants will not 
reasonably "recognize the nature, seriousness, and probable compensable character of [their] injur[ies] or disease[s]" immediately after the offending workplace accident. Id.; e.g., 
Hayashi, 93 Hawai
'i at 10, 12, 994 P.2d at 1056, 1058 (holding 
that the claimant timely filed his March 1994 workers' compensation claim—which arose out of a temporomandibular joint ("TMJ") injury, the symptoms of which began to bother him "immediately" after the May 1991 workplace incident causing it—because "a TMJ injury is difficult to diagnose" and the claimant "had never heard of a condition called TMJ disorder until it was diagnosed in June of 1992"). As such, reading a specific calendar-date requirement into HRS § 386–81 and/or HRS § 386–82 could prevent a class of worker-claimants with injuries that manifest gradually or are difficult to diagnose from seeking compensation under a workers' compensation system that is designed to protect them.  See Van Ness v. State Dep't of Educ., 
131 Hawai
'i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014) (liberally­
construing workers' compensation statutes to effectuate their remedial nature and humanitarian goals). Accordingly, we hold that uncertainty as to a specific calendar date of manifestation–i.e., as to the exact date on which an individual worker-claimant recognizes "the nature, seriousness and probable compensable character of [her] injury or disease," Demond, 54 Haw. at 104, 503 P.2d at 438–cannot, by itself, foreclose recovery. See Flor v. Holguin, 94 Hawai
'i 70, 84, 9 P.3d 382, 
396 (holding that the inability to pinpoint the precise cause of claimant's occupational disease was not dispositive of the 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
compensability of her claim), rev'd on other grounds, 94 Hawai 'i 
92, 9 P.3d 404 (2000). See also Brunell v. Wildwood Crest Police
 
Dep't, 822 A.2d 576, 594–96 (N.J. 2003) (demonstrating that this
 
is the majority rule).
 
Here, although the Board stated that Mokiao's
 
psychological injury manifested sometime between the "second half
 of 2008" and "March 2009" rather than on a singular date, FOF 18
 demonstrates that the Board likely identified the time frame's
 boundaries with reference to Mokiao's four counseling sessions
 with Dr. Marcia Deaton, Ph.D., with whom Mokiao met
8/ pursuant to
 
the State of Hawai 'i, Department of Health's mental health 
assistance program aimed at helping laid-off workers cope with
 job loss.
9/ This lack of precision is reasonable under the facts
 
of this case, where the March 17, 2009 Dr. Deaton Letter, which
 is the earliest document in the record to diagnose Mokiao with a
 psychological condition,
10/  does not specify the precise moment
 
when Dr. Deaton made that clinical diagnosis, and because
 Mokiao's first appointment with Dr. Deaton is the first medical
 
8/
 Mokiao met with Dr. Deaton on August 8, 2008, August 22, 2008,
October 14, 2008, and on an unspecified date in early 2009. We disagree with
Attractions and proceed as if the fourth counseling session occurred between
February 21, 2009, and March 17, 2009. Indeed, in a letter addressed to
counsel for Attractions and dated March 17, 2009 (the "March 17, 2009 Dr.
Deaton Letter"), Dr. Deaton discussed her impressions of Mokiao "last week"
and recalled that her final counseling session with Mokiao took place "upon
[Mokiao's] return from her trip to Japan for [shoulder] surgery" at Osaka
University Hospital on November 4, 2008 (the "November 4, 2008 Surgery"). And
 according to an "Urgent Request to Continue Hearing" written by Mokiao's
attorney, Mokiao returned from the November 4, 2008 Surgery on February 21,
2009.
 
9/
 We conclude that when the Board used the phrase, second half of
 
2008, in describing the beginning of the manifestation period in FOF 21 and
COL 1, it was specifically referring to Mokiao's first appointment with Dr.
Deaton. Indeed, FOF 18 states that "[a]t the time she saw Dr. Deaton in 2008,
[Mokiao] was close to meeting the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive
episode." Likewise, the language of the May 22, 2012 Decision & Order
indicates that the Board based its statement about the end of the
 manifestation period, on the date of the March 17, 2009 Dr. Deaton Letter, for
FOF 18 also recounts that "[b]y March 2009, [Mokiao] was suffering from a
diagnosable psychiatric disorder . . . ." 
10/
 Mokiao never became Dr. Deaton's "patient" due to the temporary
nature of the post-layoff health assistance program, and, "per direction of
[Dr. Deaton's] supervisor," Dr. Deaton did not keep any records of their
sessions together. Moreover, the parties did not call Dr. Deaton to testify
at any hearing related to the instant dispute. Therefore, the March 17, 2009
Dr. Deaton Letter is the only documentation of what took place during Mokiao's
post-layoff counseling sessions.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
documentation of the manifestation of Mokiao's psychological 
injury contained in the record. Therefore, the record on appeal supports the Board's determination that Mokiao first learned of the nature, seriousness, and probable compensability of her psychological injury—and therefore that the HRS § 386–82 statute of limitations began to run—at some point in time between Mokiao's first appointment with Dr. Deaton and the March 17, 2009 Dr. Deaton Letter. See, Hayashi, 93 Hawai
'i at 12, 994 P.2d at 
1058 (holding that the effects of claimant's TMJ injury became "manifest," so that the limitations period under HRS § 386–82 began to run when the claimant's injury "was accurately diagnosed" rather than when the claimant began experiencing symptoms); Flor, 94 Hawai
'i at 81, 9 P.3d at 393 ("[T]he statute 
of limitations on [the claimant]'s claims would not have begun to run until her discovery that she had contracted hepatitis C."). 
B.	 The Board permissibly disregarded Dr. Rogers' opinion
about the date of manifestation.
 
Attractions next attacks COL 1 by arguing that the
 
Board erred in FOF 20 by simply and erroneously ignoring the
 
determination by Dr. Joseph Rogers, Ph.D., that Mokiao's
 psychological injury likely "was manifest as early as October
 2006."
11/ Relying on this determination, Attractions concludes
 
that Mokiao's April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim was
 therefore barred by HRS § 386-82's two-year limit. We are not
 convinced. 
At the outset, we note that unlike its treatment of Dr.
 
Deaton's opinions in FOF 13, the Board did not find all of Dr.
 Rogers' opinions to be credible in FOF 20.
12/  We defer to the
 
11/
 Dr. Rogers conducted an Independent Psychological Evaluation
("IPE") of Mokiao, the results of which he offered in two reports alongside
his review of Mokiao's work injury-related health records to date. In these
 reports, Dr. Rogers opines that Mokiao's psychological condition "was fully
manifested by [October 20]06[,] when [Mokiao's physician] closed her case
. . . ." 
12/
 On the one hand, at the end of its first FOF mentioning Dr.
Deaton's opinions about Mokiao, the Board specifically "credits Dr. Deaton's
report and opinions." At the end of the first FOF mentioning Dr. Rogers, on
the other hand, the text is silent as to the Board's assessment of his
credibility. While the Board subsequently discussed its assessment of Dr.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Board, as the trier of fact below, in its decision to selectively 
credit Dr. Rogers' testimony and various IPE reports. See In re 
Doe, 107 Hawai 'i 12, 19, 108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005) (quoting State 
v. Lubong, 77 Hawai 'i 429, 432, 886 P.2d 766, 769 (App. 1994)) 
(explaining that the Board, as fact-finder, has inherent authority to make determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses and the applicability of evidence offered). Indeed, the record contains no medical documentation to support Dr. Rogers' opinion that Mokiao's psychological injury became manifest as early as October 2006. Alkire-Clemen v. Castle 
Medical Center, CAAP-12-0000095, 2013 WL 2301089, at *1 (Hawai
'i 
App. May 22, 2013). Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Dr. Rogers misunderstood the meaning of the term "manifestation" in the context of workers' compensation law when he was evaluating Mokiao's case.
13/ Flor, 94 Hawai 'i at 85, 9 
P.3d at 397 (citation omitted). 
As such, we find no error in the Board's decision to
 
disregard Dr. Rogers' opinion as to when Mokiao's psychological
 injury became legally manifest.
 
C.	 The record contains ample evidence to support the
Board's enumerated time-frame of manifestation.
 
Next, Attractions contends that even if we ignore Dr.
 
Rogers' opinion regarding the date of manifestation, "the [Board]
 
should have determined and concluded that the date of
 manifestation was August 8, 2008 when [Mokiao] first visited Dr.
 Deaton or August 22, 2008 when she had her second visit with Dr.
 Deaton or October 14, 2008 when she had her third visit with Dr.
 
12/(...continued)
Rogers in FOF 20, it only credited "the opinions and testimony of Dr. Rogers

relating to [Mokiao]'s diagnosable mental disorder and the source of her
 
emotional distress . . . ." (Emphasis added.) 
13/
 The legal date of manifestation concerns "the moment at which in
most instances [a] claimant [in Mokiao's position] ought to know [s]he has a
compensable claim." Flor, 94 Hawai' i at 82, 9 P.3d at 394 (quoting Lowrey v. 
McCormick Asbestos Co., 475 A.2d 1168, 1174 (1984)). Yet during his testimony
before the Board at the January 21, 2010 hearing on Mokiao's April 14, 2009Psychological Injury Claim, Dr. Rogers explained that he arrived at October2006 as a predicted date of manifestation because he believed that to be thedate when the "symptoms first became present" of what Dr. Deaton would, yearslater, diagnose as Mokiao's psychological adjustment disorder. 
7

Deaton." As we find the Board's time-frame to be sufficiently
 
supported by the record, any other conclusion that the facts in
 the record might additionally or alternatively support is
 irrelevant in light of our standard of review on appeal. 
Accordingly, we hold that the Board did not err by
 
disregarding Dr. Rogers' date-of-manifestation opinion.
 
D.
	 Mokiao was not required to appeal from an earlier
disposition resolving her physical injury claims before
filing the April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim.
 
Next, Attractions argues that if Mokiao's "psychiatric
 
condition was manifest prior to the Director's [March 12, 2009
 
Shoulder Injury Decision], then the [Board] should have
 determined that [the April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim]
 should be denied because [Mokiao] failed to timely file an appeal
 of [March 12, 2009 Shoulder Injury Decision] finding that she
 only had only a right shoulder injury pursuant to [HRS
 §] 386–87,
14/ [and because] there has not been a change in her
 
condition to allow for a reopening of her claim to add a new
 injury pursuant to [HRS §] 386–89.

conclusive between the parties, except as provided in section
386-89, unless within twenty days after a copy has been sent
to each party, either party appeals therefrom to the appellate
board by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate
board or the department.
 
15/
 HRS § 386-89 (1993) states, in relevant part:
 
(a) In the absence of an appeal and within twenty days
after copy of the decision has been sent to each party, the
director of labor and industrial relations may upon the
director's own motion or upon the application of any party
reopen a case to permit the introduction of newly discovered
evidence, and may render a revised decision.

(c) On the application of any party in interest,

awarding compensation has been issued, or at any time prior to
eight years after the rejection of a claim, review a

merit.
 
First, we note that several of Attractions' sub-
arguments on this point misconstrue the sequence of events in
 
this case. In these sub-arguments, Attractions claims that the
 Director considered Mokiao's psychological condition at the
 hearing preceding the March 12, 2009 Shoulder Injury Decision,
 which addressed Mokiao's level of physical disability and
 disfigurement as related to her August 17, 2007 petition to
 reopen an earlier, physical injury claim and considered an
 earlier decision on that claim. There is nothing in the record
 on appeal, however, to suggest that either the Director or the
 parties began to evaluate Mokiao's psychological injury for at
 least another month—until after the March 17, 2009 Dr. Deaton
 Letter. And because Mokiao also filed her April 14, 2009
 Psychological Injury Claim after the Director issued the March
 12, 2009 Shoulder Injury Decision, we cannot hold that the
 Director erred by failing to consider the injury Mokiao describes
 for the first time in her April 14, 2009 claim in the March 12,
 2009 decision. Thus, we reject all of the arguments Attractions
 premises on this reading of the facts.
 
Second, Attractions fails to cite any authority in 
support of its contention that a later-manifesting psychological injury does not constitute sufficient grounds for re-opening a workers' compensation case that previously considered only a physical injury. Hawai
'i courts interpret HRS § 386-3 broadly to 
"reflect the policy of the Workmen's Compensation Law that an employee should be indemnified for all infirmities resulting from his employment." Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 559, 319 P.3d at 478 
(quoting Royal State Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Labor & Indus. Relations Appeal Bd., 53 Haw. 32, 37, 487 P.2d 278, 281 (1971) (holding that "psychic injuries arising out of the employment relationship" are compensable under that statute)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Without more, then, Attractions' argument based on HRS §§ 386-87, -89 fails. See

Hawai'i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that the ICA 
may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position")). 
E.	 Mokiao's November 4, 2008 Surgery has no bearing on the
April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim. 
Attractions also argues that the Board erred by failing
 
to find or conclude that Attractions is "not responsible for the
 
November 4, 2008 . . . [S]urgery and [is] not responsible for any
 compensable consequences resulting from the intervening condition
 of the right shoulder as of November 4, 2008 onward." We reject
 both parts of this argument, namely: (1) that the Board should
 have addressed liability for the November 4, 2008 Surgery in its
 May 22, 2012 Decision & Order,
16/ and (2) that the November 4,
 
2008 Surgery represents an intervening event cutting off
 Attractions' liability under the April 14, 2009 Psychological
 Injury Claim.
 
(1) Upon its consideration of the April 14, 2009
 
Psychological Injury Claim, the Board had no obligation to issue
 FOFs and/or COLs related to Mokiao's physical injury—including,
 but not limited to, her November 4, 2008 Surgery. Indeed, the
 Director has not specifically addressed Mokiao's physical injury
 since the March 12, 2009 Shoulder Injury Decision, which preceded
 Mokiao's April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim by more than a
 month.
17/  And although Mokiao has, since March 12, 2009,
 
attempted to re-open her physical injury claim for consideration
 of new evidence related to the November 4, 2008 Surgery, nothing
 in the record suggests that the Director has considered these
 requests. Therefore, any determination of liability for the

 The Board acknowledged the fact that Mokiao underwent surgery in
its May 22, 2012 Decision & Order, but it did not make any findings as to
liability for this surgery. 
17/
 Although Mokiao's attorney submitted his "Urgent Request to
Continue Hearing" on the eve of the February 25, 2009 hearing, nothing in the
record suggests that the Board considered any evidence related to Mokiao's
November 4, 2008 Surgery before issuing its March 12, 2009 Shoulder Injury
Decision. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
November 4, 2008 Surgery is irrelevant to the issues before this
 
court on appeal.
 
(2) Attractions points to nothing in the record 
suggesting that Mokiao's "psychiatric injury [] was not manifest until after the unrelated November 4, 2008 right shoulder surgery/treatment," which is essentially its intervening-cause argument. Moreover, Attractions has failed to identify where it raised this argument below, and we are unable to locate it ourselves. As such, notwithstanding counsel for Attractions' emphasis on this point at oral argument, we deem it to be waived. See Lales v. Wholesale Motors Co., 133 Hawai
'i 332, 343 n.9, 328 
P.3d 341, 352 n.9 (2014) (quoting Kau v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 104 Hawai
'i 468, 474 n.6, 92 P.3d 477, 483 n.6 (2004)) 
(explaining that it is the well-settled law of this jurisdiction that points of error not argued below are deemed waived on appeal). That is, Attractions may not argue for the first time on appeal that the November 4, 2008 Surgery—or some separate event allegedly-necessitating that surgery—constitutes an intervening injury, so we hold that the Board did not err by failing to, sua sponte, address the matter below. 
F.	 Mokiao's pre-manifestation-period layoff by Employer is
not an intervening injury.
 
Next, Attractions contests the Board's FOF 23 and
 
argues in the alternative that even if the effects of Mokiao's
 
psychological injury became manifest between the "second half of
 2008" and "March 2009," as stated in the May 22, 2012 Decision &
 Order, the Board should have determined that Mokiao's August 2008
 layoff by Employer was an intervening event that cuts off
 Attractions' liability for any psychological injury manifesting
 thereafter. However, as the Board noted in FOF 20, Attractions
 has not provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption
 that Mokiao's psychological injury is the compensable consequence
 of her May 18, 2006 Shoulder Injury. See Haw. Rev. Stat.
 
§ 386–85 (1993) ("In any [workers' compensation case,] it shall
 be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the
 contrary . . . , [t]hat the claim is for a covered work
 injury[.]"). Furthermore, the HRS § 386–85 presumption "is not a
 
11
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
mere procedural device that disappears upon the introduction of 
contrary evidence." Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 
53 Haw. 406, 408, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972). Indeed, "[t]he law does not require that all evidence put before an administrative agency must support the agency's findings"; rather, "[i]t is legally sufficient if findings are supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the whole record." Poe v. 
Haw. Labor Relations Bd., 97 Hawai
'i 528, 538, 40 P.3d 930, 940 
(2002). As we have found that the Board's findings here are so supported, we will not overturn the findings and conclusions Attractions attacks on these grounds. 
In sum, although the Board did not identify a singular 
date on which the effects of Mokiao's psychological injury became manifest, the date on which Mokiao filed the April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim is within two years of all dates within the Board's second half of 2008-to-March 2009 time-frame. Thus, FOF 22 finding that the claim was timely filed is not clearly erroneous, and the need to identify a singular date within the time frame is an abstract question with no bearing on the outcome of this case. See E&J Lounge Operating Co. v. Liquor 
Comm'n of City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai
'i 320, 339, 189 
P.3d 432, 451 (2008) ("The duty of this court . . . is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give options upon . . . abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it." (quoting Wong v. Bd. of Regents, 62 Haw. 391, 395, 616 P.2d 201, 204 (1980))). As Attractions has also failed to demonstrate that its liability should be cut off by any intervening event, and because the record sufficiently supports the Board's credibility determinations and related findings, we hold that those findings are not clearly erroneous, and we therefore reject the first point of error and uphold the May 22, 2012 Decision & Order's FOFs 13, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 and COL 1. 
II.	 Attractions' future liability for Mokiao's psychological
injury is warranted. 
Attractions next argues that the Board erred in COL 2
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
by concluding that Attractions is "liable for medical care,
 
services, and supplies for the psychiatric condition/injury." 
We disagree.
 
A.	 The Board had no obligation to issue an FOF regarding
the specific impact of Mokiao's layoff from employment
on her psychological injury.
 
Attractions claims that the Board should have
 
"acknowledge[d] the extent of [Mokiao's] psychiatric injury that
 
ha[d] been caused by or aggravated by the August 2008 layoff"
 because, it continues, "unless and until [Mokiao] recovers [from]
 her psychiatric pre-existing layoff condition, [Attractions]
 should not be responsible for further medical care from August 8,
 2008 onward." However, as discussed above, we uphold the Board's
 determination in FOF 23 that the layoff was merely "an additional
 stressor that was overshadowed by the emotional effects of the
 [May 18, 2006 Shoulder Injury]." 
As such, we conclude that there is reliable, probative, 
and substantial evidence in the whole record to support the Board's findings, so the Board did not err by failing to attribute Mokiao's psychological injury to the layoff. See Van 
Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 562, 319 P.3d at 481 (quoting Akamine, 53 
Haw. at 410, 495 P.2d at 1167) (explaining that, "while it may be sound medically to say that" an alternative event was the cause of an employee's injury, such a statement is inconsequential to workers' compensation because even "the slightest factor of aggravation" can be enough to impose liability). 
B.	 The Board was not required to apportion responsibility
for Mokiao's psychological injury between Attractions
and some other party.
 
Attractions also argues that "the [Board] has erred by
 
not acknowledging the extent of the psychiatric injury that has
 
been caused by or aggravated by the condition and/or injury that
 necessitated the need for the November 4, 2008 [Surgery] and
 subsequent medical care." As noted above, however, Attractions
 fails to identify where it raised this argument below. 
Furthermore, Attractions provides no authority stating that the
 Board is required to apportion liability where a worker's injury
 
13
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
has multiple causes, cf. Van Ness, 131 Hawai 'i at 562, 319 P.3d 
at 481 ("[T]he slightest aggravation or acceleration of an injury 
by the employment activity mandates compensation." (quoting DeFries v. Ass'n of Owners, 999 Wilder, 57 Haw. 296, 309, 555 P.2d 855, 862 (1976)) (internal quotation marks omitted)), and it is not the responsibility of this reviewing court to make such an argument on Attractions' behalf. See Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 
144 n.16, 276 P.3d at 713 n.16 (citation omitted); Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). Accordingly, the argument fails. Lales, 133 
Hawai
'i at 343 n.9, 328 P.3d at 352 n.9 (citations omitted). 
C.	 The Board properly determined that Attractions may be
liable for future treatment under the April 14, 2009
Psychological Injury Claim.
 
Attractions next attacks COL 2 by arguing that "the
 
[Board] erred by addressing future issues of medical care not yet
 
before them or the Director." In the relevant portion of COL 2,
 however, the Board explained that Mokiao's "entitlement to
 specific medical care, which is not an issue before the Board, is
 dependent upon all other requirement of Chapter 386, HRS, and the
 Hawaii Workers' Compensation Medical Fee Schedule being met[.]" 
The Board correctly states the law.
 
As the Board acknowledged in COL 2,
18/ it is not limited 
to making its liability determinations only when a specific treatment plan is before it. See, e.g., Perkins v. Puna 
Plantation Haw., Ltd., No. CAAP-12-0000563, 2013 WL 5019431, at *1-2 (Hawai
'i App. Sept. 13, 2013) (holding that the Board has 
statutory authority to order an employer to pay for future medical treatment even if a specific course of treatment is not anticipated or in dispute at the time of the Board's decision). 
18/
 In relevant part, COL 2 reads:
 
[Mokiao]'s entitlement to specific medical care, which
is not an issue before the Board, is dependent upon all other
requirements of Chapter 386, HRS, and the Hawaii Workers'
 Compensation Medical Fee Schedule being met, (e.g., such care,
services, and supplies, so long as reasonably needed and as
the nature of the injury requires, and appropriately
requested, reported, authorized, and billed).  Jochola v. Maui
 
Econ[.] Opportunity, Inc. et al., AB 2005-206(M) ([Haw. LIR
 
App. Bd.] Sept[.] 25, 2008).
 
14
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
As such, we hold that it was not error for the Board to impose
 
liability on Attractions for such prospective medical care,
 services, and supplies as the nature of Mokiao's psychological
 injury requires should the need for such future treatment arise
 after the date of this disposition. 
D.	 The record sufficiently supports the Board's conclusion
that Mokiao's psychological injury warrants future
treatment.
 
Attractions additionally attacks the validity of COL 2
 
by arguing that the Board failed to "consider[] the credible
 
evidence, or lack thereof, regarding the need for medical care"
 because "there are no opinions from any health care providers
 suggesting or providing opinions that [Mokiao] was in need of
 further treatment as of the [May 22, 2012 Decision & Order]." 
This argument is factually incorrect.
 
While it is true that "an award of future treatment as 
part of the original claim cannot be affirmed without evidence in the record supporting a determination that future treatment will be 'reasonably needed' to relieve the claimant from the effects of the work injury[,]" Kuaimoku v. State, Dept. of Educ. Kauai, No. CAAP-11-0000616, 2014 WL 2921835, at *2 (Hawai
'i App. June 
27, 2014) (emphasis added); accord Pulawa v. Oahu Const. Co., 136 Hawai
'i 217, ___, 361 P.3d 444, 452 (2015) (discussing HRS 
§§ 386-21(a), -24), the record here does contain such supporting evidence. In the March 17, 2009 Dr. Deaton Letter, for example, Dr. Deaton stated that she believed Mokiao will benefit from future psychological treatment: "[W]ith some additional therapy/counseling, I expect that [Mokiao] will return to her pre-injury level of functioning." Accordingly, Dr. Deaton referred Mokiao to "several psychologists and, if necessary, psychiatrists to contact for follow-up services." Furthermore, in one of Dr. Rogers' IPE Reports, he stated that Mokiao "could probably benefit from continued psychological treatment"; although Dr. Rogers also concluded that "[Mokiao] would be much better off to pursue psychological treatment following case []closure, outside of the Workers' Compensation system. And at the relevant Board hearing, Dr. Rogers agreed that "it's 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
possible" that Mokiao can benefit from future treatment after
 
resolution of this case. 
As we will not disturb the Board's credibility 
determinations affording weight to these medical opinions unless they are not supported by sufficient evidence in the record on appeal, Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai
'i 43, 51, 85 P.3d 150, 158 
(2004) (citations omitted), COL 2 stands. 
III. Attractions has waived its objection to the sufficiency of
the notice it received prior to the January 21, 2010 hearing
before the Director.
 
For its final point, Attractions challenges COL 3 and 
argues that the Board "erred in concluding that the [PPD] award 
should be vacated" because the Notice of Hearing dated December 18, 2009 did not properly notify the parties that PPD would be addressed at the January 21, 2010 hearing on Mokiao's April 14, 2009 Psychological Injury Claim. However, Attractions does not identify where it raised the argument below, and we observe no evidence of it in the record. As such, the argument is waived. See Rapp. v. Schmidt, No. 27883, 2008 WL 4001189, at 
*1 (Hawai
'i App. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing In re Guardianship of 
Carlsmith, 113 Hawai 'i at 225, 151 P.3d at 706) (finding that the 
parties, who appeared through counsel at a hearing and "did not make any objections regarding notice or service at that time[,]" had waived those objections). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board's Decision and Order filed on
 May 22, 2012.
