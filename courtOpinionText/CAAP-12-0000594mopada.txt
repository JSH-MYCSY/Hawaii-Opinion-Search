Court of the Third Circuit  (circuit court) in favor of
Appellees-Appellees Laupahoehoe Community Public Charter School; 
Laupahoehoe Alumni/Community Association; Laupahoehoe Community

Education, State of Hawai' i; and the State of Hawai' i, Charter 
School Review Panel (collectively, Appellees). The circuit court granted Appellees' motion to dismiss Appellants' appeal. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In 2010, the Laupahoehoe Community Public Charter
 
School (Charter School) began as a project to convert Laupahoehoe
 
High and Elementary School (Laupahoehoe), then a Department of
 
Education (DOE) school, to a public charter school. 
At the time,
 
the governing law on public charter schools was contained in
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 302B (2007 Repl.). The
 
statute required DOE schools to submit a charter application and
 
a detailed implementation plan (DIP) to the Charter School Review
 
Panel (CSRP), which had the power to review, approve, or deny
 
charter applications and significant amendments to DIPs. HRS
 
§ 302B-6 (2007 Repl.). On September 14, 2010, the CSRP notified
 
the Charter School that its application had been reviewed and
 
would be moving toward the next stage.
 
On May 31, 2011, the CSRP notified the Charter School's
 
2
interim local school board  (Charter School ILSB) that its
charter application had been denied based on several concerns. 
The Charter School ILSB appealed the CSRP's decision to the Board
 
of Education (BOE) which, pursuant to HRS § 302B-3.5 (2007
 
Repl.), had the power to decide appeals from the CSRP's decision. 
The BOE issued a decision on August 3, 2011, reversing the CSRP's

 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
 
2
 HRS § 302B-6 required DOE schools establish an interim local school
board which would serve as the governing body during the conversion process and
would receive notifications from the CSRP regarding the charter application's
status.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denial of the charter application and granting the request for
 
the issuance of a charter.
 
After the BOE's decision, the CSRP advised the Charter
 
School ILSB that certain assurances needed to be met before
 
Laupahoehoe could begin operating as a charter school in the
 
2012-2013 school year. Among other things, the CSRP required
 
that the Charter School elect a local school board. This pre­
opening deadline was based on the Charter School's DIP, which had
 
stated the Charter School ILSB would transition the school's
 
governance to a local school board by September 2011. See HRS
 
§ 302B-7 (2007 Repl.) (requiring charter schools have a local
 school board that would act as the autonomous governing body of
 
its charter school). 
On October 24, 2011, the Charter School ILSB informed
 
the CSRP that it could not meet the CSRP's deadline to complete
 
the local school board election. It submitted a proposed
 
amendment to the DIP that would allow it to delay the election to
 
after the start of the 2012-2013 school year (no later than
 
September 30, 2012). At a CSRP general meeting held on November
 
10, 2011, the CSRP decided that because of the Charter School's
 
failure to hold an election, the conversion would not occur in
 
the 2012-2013 school year, and Laupahoehoe would operate as a DOE
 
school for that year. The CSRP accordingly informed the Charter
 
School ILSB and the DOE of its decision.
 
The Charter School ILSB then filed two appeals to the
 
BOE. The first appeal challenged the CSRP's denial of the DIP
 
amendment of the election date. The second appeal challenged the
 
CSRP's decision to withhold the conversion to charter school
 
status for the 2012-2013 school year.
 
The BOE held a hearing on January 17, 2012, with the
 
Charter School and the CSRP as the parties to the appeals. On
 
January 24, 2012, the BOE issued a decision concluding for
 
various reasons that the CSRP's denial of the DIP amendment was
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erroneous. The BOE consequently reversed the CSRP's denial,
 
concluded the second appeal was moot in light of its decision,
 
and instructed the CSRP and the DOE to "use their best efforts to
 
cooperate with [the Charter School] in the process of opening the
 
charter school for the 2012-13 school year."
 
On February 23, 2012, Appellants (two teachers at 
Laupahoehoe and the Hawai' i State Teachers Association (HSTA)) 
filed an administrative appeal from the BOE's decision in the circuit court. On March 14, 2012, Appellees filed a joint motion 
to dismiss the appeal for lack of standing, and the circuit court 
held a hearing on the motion on April 18, 2012. 
At the hearing's conclusion, the circuit court found
 
Appellants had not participated in the agency proceedings from
 
which they had filed their appeal. Nothing in the record
 
indicated Appellants attended the BOE hearing, and Appellants did
 
not argue this. Rather, Appellants relied on a letter which HSTA
 
had sent to the BOE requesting to participate in the BOE's
 
hearing. However, the record showed the BOE did not receive this
 
letter until the day after the January 17, 2012 BOE hearing. 
Based on these facts, the circuit court determined Appellants had
 
failed to participate in the BOE hearing and therefore lacked
 
standing to appeal.
 
The circuit court entered its order granting Appellees'
 
motion to dismiss and its final judgment on May 25, 2012, and
 
Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal,
 
Appellants contend the circuit court erred in determining that
 
Appellants did not participate in the proceeding and in
 
dismissing the appeal.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject 
matter jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo." Cnty. of 
Hawai'i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai' i 391, 403-04, 235 P.3d 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1103, 1115-16 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citation
 
omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
We conclude this appeal has been rendered moot by the
 
occurrence of subsequent events. The mootness doctrine applies
 
"where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court have
 
so affected the relations between the parties that the two
 
conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal — adverse
 
interest and effective remedy — have been compromised." Lathrop
 
v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, 313, 141 P.3d 480, 486 (2006) 
(quoting Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawai' i, 62 Haw. 391, 
394, 616 P.2d 201, 203-04 (1980)). The parties agree that after the circuit court entered its final judgment, Laupahoehoe began 
operating as a charter school for the 2012-2013 school year, and 
it currently has a governing board in place. Furthermore, in the 
2012 legislative session, the Legislature repealed HRS Chapter 
302B and replaced it with HRS Chapter 302D. See 2012 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 130, § 1 at 443. 
None of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply. 
The first exception applies to government actions that are "capable of repetition, yet evading review." Hamilton ex rel. 
Lethem v. Letham, 119 Hawai' i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). 
The second exception, the "public interest" exception, requires 
consideration of "(1) the public or private nature of the 
question presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative 
determination for future guidance of public officers, and (3) the 
likelihood of future recurrence of the question." Id. at 6-7, 
193 P.3d at 844-45. 
Appellants contend the exceptions apply here because
 
the issues presented in this case are likely to recur. If these
 issues arise again, however, they will arise under the new
 
statutes in HRS Chapter 302D. Although Appellants claim HRS
 
Chapters 302B and 302D are functionally identical, we disagree
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and conclude the new statutes have substantively changed the law
 
on these issues. 
This appeal arose out of the CSRP's denial of the
 
proposed amendment to the DIP changing the local school board
 
election date. HRS Chapter 302D has removed all references to
 
DIPs, however, and has replaced the DIP's role with "charter
 
applications" to obtain charter school status and "charter
 
contracts" that outline the parties' powers, duties, and
 
performance expectations. See HRS § 302D-1 (Supp. 2012). 
Therefore, disputes regarding DIP amendments will not recur. 
Also, under the new laws, applicants seeking to convert
 
from a DOE school to a charter school are generally not allowed
 to amend charter applications. HRS § 302D-14(j) (Supp. 2012). 
Authorizers, which have replaced the CSRP's role, have the power
 
to approve or deny charter applications and charter contract
 
renewals or revocations only. HRS § 302D-5 (Supp. 2012); see
 
also HRS § 302D-15 (Supp. 2012) (giving the BOE the power to
 
decide appeals of authorizer decisions that "deny the approval of
 
a charter application, deny reauthorization of a charter school,
 
or revoke a charter school's charter."). Appellants have not
 
shown that it is probable or even possible that issues presented
 
here will recur under an authorizer's power to review charter
 
applications or charter contracts. 
Moreover, it is not necessary that this court make a
 
decision regarding Appellants' standing for the guidance of
 
future public officers. Standing requires an individualized,
 
case-by-case inquiry, and as noted above, the circuit court based
 
its decision on the specific facts of this case. Future cases
 
will likely involve different circumstances and different
 
interests, and any decision we render here would be hypothetical,
 
with little or no application. Therefore, we do not review the
 
circuit court's ruling on standing.
