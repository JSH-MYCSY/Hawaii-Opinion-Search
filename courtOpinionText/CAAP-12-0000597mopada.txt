IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I

(FC-DIVORCE NO. 07-1-1120)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sami Tamman (Sami) appeals from the
 
May 25, 2012 "Judgment for Delinquent Child Support And Alimony"
 
(May Judgment) entered in the Family Court of the First Circuit1
 
(family court) in No. CAAP-12-0000597. Subsequently, Sami
 appealed the family court's July 31, 2012 "Findings And Judgment
 
Of Civil Contempt Of Court" (July Findings/Judgment) in No. CAAP­
12-0000718. These two appeals were consolidated under No. CAAP
 
12-0000597 by order of this court entered November 9, 2012.
 
On appeal, Sami contends the family court erred by: (1)
 
entering the May Judgment against him for payment of sums in the
 
amount of $420,338 while the matter was still under appeal; and
 
(2) finding Sami in civil contempt without clear and convincing
 
evidence of his current ability to pay in satisfaction of the
 
July Findings/Judgment.

I. BACKGROUND
 
Sami and Plaintiff-Appellee Jacqueline Tamman
 
(Jacqueline) were married in Brazil May 25, 1983. Sami is a
 
Sudanese native with Swiss citizenship. Jacqueline is a
 
Brazilian native with Brazilian and Swiss citizenship. The
 
parties had four children during their marriage: Alexander (born
 
October 25, 1999 in Switzerland), Vanessa (born February 22, 2001
 
in Switzerland), Nathalie (born December 26, 2002 in Honolulu),
 
and Caroline (born April 8, 2004 in Honolulu). Alexander and
 
Vanessa hold Swiss citizenship; Nathalie and Caroline hold dual
 
United States and Swiss citizenship. Jacqueline and the children
 
have legal status to remain in the United States.
 
Sami and Jacqueline visited Hawaif i in 2001, purchased 
two leasehold condominiums, and returned to live in 2003. From 
July 2003 to December 2006, Sami was present in Hawaif i 
approximately three months of the year, spending the majority of his time in Switzerland and other places. 
On April 5, 2007, Jacqueline filed a complaint for
 
divorce against Sami in family court. Jacqueline unsuccessfully
 
attempted to serve Sami in Switzerland with a: (1) Complaint for
 
Divorce, (2) Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Immediate Custody,
 
Restraining Order Enjoining Removal of Children, Exclusive
 
Occupancy of Kahala Residence, and/or an Order Shortening Time
 
Hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Pre-Decree Relief, (3) Motion

 On October 16, 2007, the family court ordered
Jacqueline to file a motion to declare service effected pursuant
 
to 
Tataragasi v. Tataragasi, 477 S.E.2d 239 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996)
 
if Swiss authorities were unable to effect service on Sami by

December 5, 2007. On November 30, 2007, Sami appears to have
 
initiated divorce proceedings in Switzerland. On December 5,
 
2007, counsel for Sami made a special appearance to contest
 
3
jurisdiction and the family court  held a hearing on January 2,
2008 on that issue. Further hearings were held, supplemental
 
briefs were submitted on specific jurisdictional issues, and on
 
4
September 19, 2008, the family court  determined it had subject
matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over Sami and
 
Jacqueline.
 
On December 11, 2008, the Swiss Republic and Canton of
 
Geneva Judiciary Power issued a Swiss divorce decree, granting
 
the divorce but specifically declaring it did not have
 
jurisdiction to rule on matters regarding the children.
5
 
6
On May 10, 11 and 12, 2010, the family court  held a
trial on child custody, child visitation, and child support. 
Based on that hearing, on July 8, 2010, the family court entered
 
its "Order Granting Custody, Visitation, And Support"
 
(Custody/Support Order) and its Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 
of Law (FOFs/COLs) in support of its Custody/Support Order.
7
 The family court  acknowledged the validity of the
Swiss divorce decree in its FOFs/COLs.
 
4.	 On December 11, 2008, a divorce Decree was issued in
Switzerland. The order dissolved the 25-year marriage
of Plaintiff and Defendant.
 
On July 19, 2010, Sami filed a Hawaif i Family Court 
(HFCR) Rule 59 "Motion For Reconsideration Of Order Entered On 
July 8, 2010 Or In The Alternative Motion For New Trial And/Or

Reopening Of The Hearing" (Motion for Reconsideration). On
 
September 7, 2010, the family court denied the substance of
 
Sami's Motion for Reconsideration.8
 
On September 20, 2010, Sami filed a notice of appeal 
under No. CAAP-10-0000032 from the family court's order denying 
his Motion for Reconsideration. On November 29, 2011, this court 
entered a Summary Disposition Order (SDO) dismissing Sami's 
appeal.9 Sami filed a writ of certiorari to the Hawaif i Supreme 
Court, who subsequently issued its own SDO on March 28, 2012.10 
The supreme court's SDO concluded this court erred by restricting 
its review to the family court's September 7, 2010 order denying 
Sami's Motion for Reconsideration and by not considering the 
underlying Custody/Support Order. The case was remanded to this 
court. On April 27, 2012, this court issued another SDO in 
reconsideration the family court's September 7, 2010 order 
denying Sami's Motion for Reconsideration together with the 
Custody/Support Order. On June 8, 2012, Sami filed a writ of 
certiorari to the supreme court, which was denied on August 9, 
2012. See Tamman v. Tamman, No. CAAP-10-0000032, 2012 WL 1473426 
(App. April 27, 2012) (SDO), (cert. denied, SCWC-10-0000032, 2012 
WL 3240753, at *1 (Haw. Aug. 9, 2012). 
On May 21 and 22, 2012, the family court held a hearing
 
on Jacqueline's Motion and Affidavit for Post Decree Relief filed
 
November 21, 2011. The family court found that Sami owed
 
Jacqueline $420,338 in child support and alimony arrearages
 
through April 2012.
 
8 The family court's order denying Sami's Motion for Reconsideration
granted the motion in part to correct a clerical error in the Custody/Support
Order by adding the words "As allowed by law" to the beginning of paragraph 10
regarding continuing jurisdiction of the family court. In all other respects,
the Motion for Reconsideration was denied.

 This court entered its final judgment on appeal on December 15,
2011.

 The Hawaif i Supreme Court entered its final judgment on appeal on
April 25, 2012.

his net monthly pay is $5,762. He reports expenses in the amount
 
of $13,551 and a monthly deficiency of (-)$7,789. Sami's Asset
 
and Debt Statement, shows a balance of $14,510 from three banks

and debts is $1,421,096.
 
On May 25, 2012, the family court entered its May
 
Judgment, which is at issue in this appeal. On November 26,
 
2012, the family court filed its FOFs/COLs, from the May 21 and
 
22, 2012 hearings, which affirmed findings supporting its
 
Custody/Support Order. The family court's FOFs/COLs included the
 
following findings:

not credible. (FOF 107)
 
e. 	[Sami] deceived the [family court], inter alia,

f. 	[Sami] has ownership interests in the Hotel
Churchill and Hotel Century, located in Geneva,
Switzerland. (FOF 111)

situation. (FOF 112)
 
. . . .

Appeal regarding the [Custody/Support] Order. [Sami] did
not seek a stay of enforcement and did not post a bond.

 21. [Sami's] total child support and alimony arrearage, as
of April 2012, is $420,338.00.
 22. [Sami] owns a residence in Geneva Switzerland in part of a
7-bedroom, 5-bathroom house, with a net value of $1.3-$1.5 million
dollars - or higher.
 
23. [Sami] claimed the Geneva property was tied up in
litigation with [Jacqueline], but he also admitted that his
whole objective is to preserve this asset for the children ­therefore not as a source to pay his child and spousal
support obligation.
 
24. [Sami] is motivated to prevent [Jacqueline] from having any
part of the Geneva property, and will keep the property tied
up in litigation as long as possible to achieve this goal.

his income and assets.
 
31. [Sami] conceded that [Jacqueline] could have gotten a
Judgment for Justice McKenna's [Custody/Support] Order at
any time, even while the Order was on appeal.

parties and the case and that Sami owed $420,338 to Jacqueline
 
for child support and alimony, including arrearages.
 
On July 30, 2012, the family court held a hearing on
 
the issue of Sami's civil contempt and entered an order based on
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
its findings. The family court issued its July Findings/Judgment
 
on July 31, 2012 finding:
 
1. 	[Sami] was ordered to pay child support and alimony, and
obtain life insurance as security for his child support
obligation. Delinquent child support and alimony arrears up
through April 30, 2012 have been reduced to a judgment of
$420,338.00. 
2. 	[Sami] presently has the ability and power to comply
with the court order.
 
3. 	[Sami] is presently refusing to comply with the order.
 
4. 	[Sami] does not have the privilege, right or lawful
basis to refuse to comply.
 
Therefore, [Sami] is in civil contempt of court in violation
of [Hawaii Revised Statutes §] 710-1077(6) [(1993)].
 
The family court ordered Sami to: (1) satisfy half the
 
judgment of $420,338 immediately; (2) the other half within the
 
next six months; and (3) to obtain a life insurance policy that
 
includes benefits for his children. 
On August 15, 2012, Sami filed a notice of appeal from
 
the family court's July Findings/Judgment to this court.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawaif i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawaif i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
"Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawaif i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
B. Family Court Findings of Fact (FOFs)
and Conclusions of Law (COLs)
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal under
the 'clearly erroneous' standard. A FOF is clearly
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in
support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has
 been made. 'Substantial evidence' is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable
a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court's COLs are
reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong standard.
COLs, consequently, are not binding upon an appellate court
and [are] freely reviewable for [their] correctness.
 
. . . .
 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway in its
examination of the reports concerning [a child's] care,
custody[,] and welfare, and its conclusions [in this
regard], if supported by the record and not clearly
erroneous, must stand on appeal.
 
 
In re Doe, 95 Hawaif i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and ellipses omitted).
 
C. Jurisdiction in Civil Matters
 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
 
that [the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong
 
standard." Captain Andy's Sailing, Inc., v. Dep't of Land and
 
Natural Resources, State of Hawaif i, 113 Hawaif i 184, 192, 150 
P.3d 833, 841 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation
 
omitted).
 
D. Civil Contempt Orders
 
The appellate court reviews "civil contempt orders
 
under the abuse of discretion standard. An abuse of discretion
 
occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of
 
reason or has disregarded rules or principles of law or practice
 
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Wahba, LLC v.
 
USRP (Don), LLC
, 106 Hawaif i 466, 472, 106 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2005) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Sami contends the family court lacked jurisdiction to 
issue its May Judgment and underlying orders because they 
concerned matters that were pending under appeal. See Tamman v. 
Tamman, No. CAAP-10-0000032, 2012 WL 1473426 (App. April 27, 
2012) (SDO), (cert. denied, SCWC-10-0000032, 2012 WL 3240753, at 
*1 (Haw. Aug. 9, 2012). "[O]nce a party files a notice of 
appeal, the lower court is generally divested of jurisdiction to 
proceed further on the matter. . . . [H]owever, the family court 
retains jurisdiction to enforce its own judgments and decrees." 
Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawaif i 126, 143, 276 P.3d 695, 712 
(2012) citation omitted). 
The family court's May Judgment and July Findings/
 
Judgment were issued to support the prior Custody/Support Order
 compelling Sami to pay Jacqueline $7,810 per month in child
 
support, arrearages dating back to April 5, 2007, temporary
 
alimony arrearages, and interest.
 
Sami argues the family court's May Judgment did not
 
merely enforce the monetary portions of the Custody/Support
 
Order, but "modified them to create new amounts and thus new
 
orders." The family court's FOFs/COLs, upon which the May
 
Judgment was based, make clear the "new amounts" Sami owed to
 
Jacqueline represent updated arrearages for the approximately two
 
year period during which Sami remained in non-compliance with the
 
Custody/Support Order.
 
The family court ordered Sami to pay $7,810 a month in
 
child support, the same amount quoted in the Custody/Support
 
Order. The family court's $420,338 figure is consistent with its
 
findings that Sami: (1) had made no payments towards the $39,060
 
owed in alimony arrearages; (2) owed $7,810 per month in child
 
support for the months between June 2010 and April 2012,
 
totaling $179,630; (3) had paid only $3,128 per month in child
 
support for the months between October 2010 and April 2012,
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
totaling $59,432; and (4) owed child support arrearages from 
April 2007 through April 2012 in the amount of $381,278. In 
turn, the family court's findings were supported by the record, 
including a Certification of Account Balance dated May 16, 2012, 
from the State of Hawaif i Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) 
reflecting a balance owed of $420,338. The record also contains CSEA's Month to Month Transaction Summary reflects child support 
and spousal support arrearages as of May 2010 in the amounts of 
$261,080 and $39,060 respectively. The family court's May 
Judgment did not represent "new orders" or modified orders as 
alleged by Sami. Accordingly, the family court did not lack 
jurisdiction to enforce its prior orders through its May Judgment 
or conclude that Sami owed child support and alimony arrearage as 
of April 2012 in the amount of $420,338. See Kakinami, 127 
Hawaifi at 143, 276 P.3d at 712 (after a party files a notice of 
appeal, "the family court retains jurisdiction to enforce its own 
judgments and decrees."). 
Sami also contends the family court erred by finding
 
him in civil contempt without clear and convincing evidence of
 
his current ability to satisfy the $420,338 judgment against him. 
Citing the July Findings/Judgment, Sami argues the family court's
 
reliance on its Custody/Support Order is evidence the proceedings
 
lack "any new evidence regarding [Sami's] current 2012 ability to
 
pay the amounts ordered by Judge McKenna." (Emphasis added.) 
Sami both misstates the burden of proof in a finding of civil
 
contempt and fails to establish error on the part of the family
 
court. 
The family court may "[e]nforce decrees and judgments
 
and punish contempts according to law[.]" Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 571-8.5(a)(6) (2006 Repl.); see also HRS § 710­
1077(6) (Supp. 2012) ("When the contempt consists of the refusal
 
to perform an act which the contemnor has the power to perform,
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the contemnor may be imprisoned until the contemnor has performed
 
it.") Further, 
[w]hen a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order
compelling a parent to furnish support, including child
support, medical support, or other remedial care, for the
parent's child, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of
a civil contempt of court upon proof that:
 
(1) The order was made, filed, and served on the
parent or proof that the parent was present in court at
the time the order was pronounced; and
 
(2) The parent did not comply with the order.
 
HRS § 710-1077(6)(1) and (2), see also HRS § 571-81(b)(1) and (2)
 
(Supp. 2012). 
Sami has not disputed that the family court had prima 
facie evidence of his civil contempt of court. Alvarez Family 
Trust v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kaanapali Alii, 121 Hawaif i 
474, 488, 221 P.3d 452, 466 (2009) ("It is well-established in 
this jurisdiction that, where a party does not raise specific 
issues on appeal to [this court] or on application to [the 
Hawaifi Supreme Court], the issues are deemed waived and need not 
be considered."). 
Against the family court's prima facie evidence of
 
civil contempt, Sami had the burden of establishing that he was
 unable to comply with the family court's orders to pay support. 
Chan v. Chan, 7 Haw. App. 122, 128, 748 P.2d 807, 811 (1987)
 
(where wife established a prima facie case of civil contempt,
 
husband failed to satisfy his burden of producing evidence to
 
support his alleged present inability to comply with an order to
 
turn over his coin collection). Sami misstates this burden of
 
producing evidence by presuming that Jacqueline was required to
 
proffer evidence regarding his current 2012 ability to pay the
 
order. "In a civil contempt proceeding such as this, of course,
 
a defendant may assert a present inability to comply with the
 
order in question. It is settled, however, that in raising this
 
defense, the defendant has a burden of production." Chan, 7 Haw.

The family court's July Findings/Judgment included a
 
specific finding that Sami had the ability to comply with its
 
order. The only evidence Sami cited in support of his contention
 
that he currently lacked the ability to comply with the family
 
court orders was his own testimony on July 30, 2012. At this
 
hearing, Sami stated in relevant part that: (1) he adopted all of
 
the statements made by his counsel, including counsel's statement
 
that "all the properties [of Sami] are tied up in litigation
 
right now[,]" (2) Jacqueline's sister has prevented him from
 
selling a property in Rio de Janeiro from which he could obtain
 
$400,000, and (3) the family court's finding that Sami's income
 
is $25,000 per month is inaccurate.
 
This court does not pass upon the question of whether 
Sami's testimony constitutes credible evidence of his inability 
to comply with the family court's orders. In re Doe, 95 Hawaif i 
183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) ("it is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the 
credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is 
the province of the trier of fact.") (internal quotation marks 
and brackets omitted). The family court found Sami was not 
credible about his income and assets. The family court "[i]n 
considering [Sami's] demeanor, manner of testifying, and candor, 
in addition to the substance of his testimony, the [family court] 
finds that [Sami] was not credible about his income and assets." 
Sami contends the family court's finding that he has an
 
ability to pay cannot rely on his Asset and Debt Statement, which
 
shows a net value of all of Sami's assets and debts as
 
$1,421,096. Sami argues the main undisputed asset constituting
 
that net value is a Rio de Janeiro house valued at $1.1 million
 
and he testified that this property "was tied up in litigation
 
with [Jacqueline's] sister." The family court's FOFs/COLs

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
includes the following finding: "[Sami] also misrepresented his
 
assets and debts on his Asset and Debt statement." Sami's
 
assertion that his $1.1 million asset cannot be used to satisfy
 
the $420,338 judgment against him is exclusively supported by his
 
own testimony and representations regarding his financial assets,
 
which the family court determined were not credible. 
Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in
 
concluding that "[Sami] possesses the means to comply with the
 
[family court's] child support and alimony order."
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we affirm the Family Court of the First
 
Circuit's May 25, 2012 "Judgment for Delinquent Child Support And
 
Alimony" and the July 31, 2012 "Findings And Judgment Of Civil
 
Contempt Of Court."
