IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
EDDY A. ABORDO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-11-082314)
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Eddy A. Abordo (Abordo) by complaint with
 
Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been
 Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence
 of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII) as a repeat offender, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62 (Supp.
 2014).
1 The original complaint did not allege a mens rea for the
 
1
 HRS § 291E-62 provides in relevant part:
 
(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted
pursuant to this section or to part III or section 291E-61 or
291E-61.5, or to part VII or part XIV of chapter 286 or section
200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or 291-7 as those provisions were
in effect on December 31, 2001, shall operate or assume actual
physical control of any vehicle:
 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on the
(continued...)
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
OVLPSR-OVUII offense. Prior to trial, over Abordo's objection,
 
2
the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court)  granted
the State's motion to amend the original complaint to allege the
 
required mens rea of "intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly"
 for the OVLPSR-OVUII offense. The State then filed an amended
 complaint which alleged the required mens rea.
 
After a bench trial, Abordo was found guilty of OVLPSR­
OVUII as a repeat offender.
3 The District Court sentenced Abordo
 
to thirty days in jail, imposed a $1,000 fine and other fees and
 assessments, and revoked his driver's license for two years. The
 District Court entered its Judgment on May 30, 2012, and this
 appeal followed.

person's license; [or]
 
(2) 	While the person's license or privilege to operate a
vehicle remains suspended or revoked[.] 
. . . .
 
(b) Any person convicted of violating this section shall be
sentenced as follows without possibility of probation or
suspension of sentence:

(2)	 For an offense that occurs within five years of a
prior conviction for an offense under this section,
section 291E-66, or section 291-4.5 as that section
was in effect on December 31, 2001: 
(A)	 Thirty days imprisonment; 
(B) 	A $1,000 fine; 
(C)	 Revocation of license and privilege to operate a
vehicle for an additional two years; and 
(D)	 Loss of the privilege to operate a vehicle
equipped with an ignition interlock device, if
applicable[.]
 
2The Honorable Linda K.C. Luke presided.
 
3The District Court also found that Abordo had committed the traffic
 
infraction of improperly driving in a high occupancy vehicle lane, in
violation of HRS § 291C-222 (2007). Abordo does not challenge the District
Court's Judgment as to this traffic infraction, and we will not further
discuss it.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On appeal, Abordo contends that: (1) the original
 
complaint was defective for failing to allege the requisite mens
 
rea and the District Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the
 State's motion to amend the original complaint to cure this
 defect; (2) the District Court erred in finding Abordo guilty of
 OVLPSR-OVUII because its verdict was improperly based on the
 preponderance of the evidence standard; (3) the District Court
 violated his right of confrontation in admitting Exhibit 1, a
 letter signed by Ricky S. Akase, a custodian of government
 driving and licensing records, regarding Abordo's driver's
 license status; (4) the District Court erred in admitting Exhibit
 3, an Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office "Notice
 of Administrative Review Decision" (ADLRO Notice), and Exhibit 4,
 a traffic abstract, because they were irrelevant; and (5) there
 was insufficient evidence to support Abordo's conviction.
 
As explained below, we vacate Abordo's OVLPSR-OVUII
 
conviction because the District Court misstated the standard of
 proof in finding Abordo guilty, and we remand the case for a new
 trial on the OVLPSR-OVUII charge.
 
I.
 
We resolve the arguments Abordo raises on appeal as
 
follows:
 
A.
 
The original complaint against Abordo was defective for 
failing to allege the requisite intentional, knowing, or reckless mens rea. However, the District Court had jurisdiction to permit the State to amend the original complaint to cure this defect, and the District Court properly granted the State's motion to amend the original complaint. State v. Kam, 134 Hawai
'i 280, 
286-87, 339 P.3d 1081, 1087-88 (App. 2014). The amended complaint was sufficient, and the District Court correctly proceeded to trial on the amended complaint. 
B.
 
Abordo argues that the District Court improperly relied
 
on the preponderance of the evidence standard in finding him

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
guilty of OVLPSR-OVUII. The District Court stated that it was
 
finding Abordo guilty "after full consideration of the evidence
 by a preponderance of the credible substantial evidence[.]" The
 State was required to prove Abordo's guilt beyond a reasonable
 doubt. In light of the District Court's misstatement of the
 applicable standard of proof, we vacate Abordo's OVLPSR-OVUII
 conviction.

C.
 
We now address Abordo's challenge to the admissibility
 
of Exhibits 1, 3, and 4 and his sufficiency of evidence claim to
 determine whether he can be retried on the OVLPSR-OVUII charge.
 
1.
 
Exhibit 1 is a letter signed by Ricky S. Akase, as 
custodian of records for the Driver License Section, in which he certifies that the records of the Driver License Section indicate that Abordo did not have a valid Hawai
'i driver's license on the 
"VIOLATION DATE[.]" We agree with Abordo that Akase's letter is testimonial and that based on Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), the admission of the letter in lieu of testimony by Akase violated Abordo's confrontation rights. State v. 
Souleng, --- P.3d ---, No. CAAP-12-0000196, 2015 WL 291341, at *4, 6-7 (Hawai
'i App. Jan. 22, 2015). Based on Souleng, we 
conclude that the District Court erred in admitting Exhibit 1. 
2.
 
We reject Abordo's argument that the District Court
 
erred in admitting Exhibits 3 and 4 because they were irrelevant. 
Abordo claims these exhibits were irrelevant because the State
 failed to show that Exhibits 3 and 4 pertained to him. We
 disagree. Exhibit 4, the traffic abstract, references "Case ID:
 
4We note that after Abordo filed his notice of appeal, the District
Court entered findings of fact and conclusion of law that correctly stated and
applied the beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof. However, both
parties agree that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the
findings of fact and conclusions of law after the notice of appeal was filed.
Accordingly, we do not consider the findings of fact and conclusions of law in
rendering our decision.

1DTC-11-082314 -- State v. Eddy A. Abordo," which is the instant
 
case, and is the traffic abstract for "Abordo, Eddy Mark," who
 (based on the trial testimony of police officers who issued
 citations to Abordo) has the same date of birth and social
 security number as Abordo. Exhibit 4 also references the
 information contained in Exhibit 3, the ADLRO Notice for "Abordo,
 Eddy Mark," who according to Exhibit 3 has the same social
 security number as Abordo. We conclude that there was sufficient
 evidence to show that Exhibits 3 and 4 pertained to Abordo. We
 further conclude that these exhibits were relevant to show
 Abordo's prior driver's license revocations related to operating
 a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) and his
 prior conviction for OVLPSR-OVUII.
 
3.
 
We also conclude that, excluding consideration of 
Exhibit 1, there was sufficient evidence to support Abordo's conviction for OVLPSR-OVUII as a repeat offender. The evidence (aside from Exhibit 1) showed that the ADLRO administratively revoked Abordo's driver's license for life in 1992; that he was cited on June 28, 2007, and he pleaded no contest and was convicted of OVLPSR-OVUII in Case No. 1DTC-07-037873 on January 30, 2008; that he signed the Judgment in Case No. 1DTC-07-037873 that was filed on January 30, 2008; and that when Abordo was stopped by a police officer in the instant case on December 7, 2011, he was unable to produce a driver's license and told the officer he did not have a license. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Abordo's conviction for OVLPSR­OVUII as a repeat offender, including sufficient evidence to show that he acted with a reckless state of mind regarding whether his license remained revoked for an OVUII-related revocation on the date of the charged OVLPSR-OVUII offense. See State v. Pantoja, 
89 Hawai
'i 492, 495-96, 974 P.2d 1082, 1085-86 (App. 1999); State 
v. Davis, 133 Hawai 'i 102, 122, 324 P.3d 912, 932 (2014); State 
v. Lioen, 106 Hawai 'i 123, 130-32, 102 P.3d 367, 374-76 (App. 
2004).

II.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the District
 
Court's May 30, 2012, Judgment with respect to Abordo's
 
conviction for OVLPSR-OVUII, and we remand the case for a new
 trial on the OVLPSR-OVUII charge.
