STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAKE RAGRAGOLA-LENCHANKO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTA-11-05118)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jake Ragragola-Lenchanko 
(Ragragola-Lenchanko) appeals from the May 29, 2012 Judgment and 
August 14, 2012 Order disposing of certain post-judgment motions 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, 'Ewa Division 
(District Court).1 Ragragola-Lenchanko was convicted of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2014).2

 The Honorable T. David Woo, Jr. presided.

 HRS § 291E-61(a) states:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:

In this consolidated appeal, Ragragola-Lenchanko 
contends, in CAAP-12-0000605, that (1) the Complaint failed to 
allege the requisite mens rea, and the District Court erred by 
allowing the Complaint to be amended to state the requisite mens rea; (2) the Amended Complaint was defective because the charge 
was pleaded in the disjunctive; (3) the District Court failed to 
adequately advise Ragragola-Lenchanko of his rights, pursuant to 
Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995) and 
State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai 'i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000); (4) a 
continuance should have been granted to review discovery made 
available immediately prior to trial, the denial of which 
amounted to a reversal of a pretrial discovery order by another 
judge; and (5) the results of Ragragola-Lenchanko's breath test 
from an Intoxilyzer should not have been admitted. 
In appeal CAAP-12-0000798, Ragragola-Lenchanko contends
 
that (6) he timely filed a Motion to Arrest Judgment and a Motion
 
to Vacate, Correct and/or Reduce Sentence, thereby tolling the
 
time to file a Notice of Appeal and, thus his appeals are timely;
 
(7) his Motion to Arrest Judgment should have been granted
 
because the District Court lacked jurisdiction to allow the
 
Complaint to be amended; (8) the judge should have recused
 
himself based upon Ragragola-Lenchanko's Motion for New Trial;
 
(9) Ragragola-Lenchanko's illegal sentence should have been
 
vacated or corrected pursuant to a Motion to Vacate, Correct
 
2(...continued)
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an 
amount sufficient to impair the person's normalmental faculties or ability to care for theperson and guard against casualty;
 (2) While under the influence of any drug thatimpairs the person's ability to operate thevehicle in a careful and prudent manner;
 (3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per twohundred ten liters of breath; or
 (4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per onehundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and/or Reduce Sentence; and (10) the District Court should have
 
granted his Motion for Entry of Order to enter a written order
 
Ragragola-Lenchanko prepared based upon a prior discovery order
 
orally granted by another judge.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Ragragola-Lenchanko's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Ragragola-Lenchanko's claim that the District Court 
lacked jurisdiction to permit the State to amend the Complaint is 
without merit. Under Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 7(f)(1), the District Court had discretion to permit the State to amend the charge in the Complaint before trial "if the 
substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced." State 
v. Kam, 134 Hawai
'i 280, 286-87, 339 P.3d 1081, 1087-88 
(App. 2014) (district court did not err by allowing State to 
amend OVUII charge to include mens rea), cert. granted 2015 WL 
1526201 (Apr. 2, 2015). Ragragola-Lenchanko does not claim that 
his substantial rights were prejudiced by the amendment of the 
Complaint to include the requisite mens rea for OVUII. 
(2) The Amended Complaint was not defective for being
 
pleaded in the disjunctive. Ragragola-Lenchanko points to the
 
language of the charge which states he:
 
did intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly operate or
 
assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public
way, street, road, or highway while under the influence of
alcohol in an amount to impair mental faculties or ability
to care for himself and guard against casualty; and/or
operate or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon
a public way, street, road, or highway with .08 or more
 grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath
 
. . . .
 
Ragragola-Lenchanko claims that the charge was
 
improperly pleaded in the disjunctive and therefore did not
 
provide him with sufficient notice of the charge against him.
 
"[A]cts may be charged disjunctively when the words
 
used charge similar or analogous forms of conduct that are
 
codified in a single subsection of a statute." State v.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Codiamat, 131 Hawai 'i 220, 227, 317 P.3d 664, 671 (2013) (citing 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i 48, 51, 276 P.3d 617, 620 (2012)). 
Ragragola-Lenchanko was charged with violating two different 
subsections of HRS § 291E-61: (a)(1) and (a)(3). Thus, the 
language within each subsection in the Amended Complaint may be 
charged in the disjunctive. The Amended Complaint properly 
stated "and/or" when charging the two subsections in the 
alternative. State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 250, 831 P.2d 924, 
932 (1992); State v. Cabral, 8 Haw. App. 506, 510-11, 810 P.2d 672, 675-76 (1991).
3 
(3) Ragragola-Lenchanko claims that the District Court
 
erred by failing to advise him that the decision to remain silent
 
could not be used against him and that he was not advised that he
 
had a right not to testify. The State admits that the District
 
Court did not advise Ragragola-Lenchanko of those rights. 
Ragragola-Lenchanko was not properly advised during a 
pre-trial colloquy required by State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai 'i 292, 
297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000) (prior to the start of trial, the court is required to inform the defendant of the right to testify 
or not testify and that prior to the end of trial that the 
decision to not testify is the defendant's own) and the ultimate 
colloquy required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 234, 
237, 900 P.2d 1293, 1301, 1304 (1995) (court must inform defendant of the right to testify immediately prior to the close 
of the defendant's case). However, "Tachibana does not require 
that the court engage in the colloquy if the defendant chooses to 
testify in his or her own behalf." Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i at 296, 12 
P.3d at 1237. Ragragola-Lenchanko testified at trial, therefore, Tachibana is inapplicable. Ragragola-Lenchanko also makes no 
claim that his decision to do so was not voluntarily, knowingly, 
3
 Ragragola-Lenchanko did not claim that he did not understand the
term "alcohol" in the Amended Complaint prior to trial. Therefore, the claim
is waived and is not plain error. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) and State v. Turping, CAAP-13-0002957, 2015 WL 792715(App. Feb. 25, 2015) cert. denied, SCWC-13-0002957, 2015 WL 3381360 (May 25,2015).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and intelligently made. Thus, there can be no finding of error 
in this case. State v. Monteil, 134 Hawai 'i 361, 373, 341 P.3d 
567, 579 (2014). 
(4) Ragragola-Lenchanko argues that Judge Dean Ochiai's
 
May 1, 2012 order for disclosure of discovery relating to the
 Intoxilyzer 8000 breath alcohol testing machine ought to have
 
4
been upheld by the District Court,  that a continuance should
have been granted to him because the prosecution provided
 
discovery on the morning of trial, and the District Court should
 
have made this proffered discovery part of the record for the
 
purposes of review.
 
Ragragola-Lenchanko alleges Judge Woo erred in 
"overturning" Judge Ochiai's order to disclose discovery, and 
that, under 
Wong, a court should "be hesitant to modify, vacate 
or overrule a prior interlocutory order of another judge who sits in the same court[,]" unless "cogent reasons support the second 
court's action[.]" Wong v. City & County of Honolulu,, 66 Haw. 
389, 395-96, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983) (emphasis omitted). However, the rule in Wong is not absolute; a subsequent judge may 
overturn or change an earlier ruling "once the facts are more 
fully developed, thus making obvious the prejudice which would 
result from enforcing the early ruling." State v. Oughterson, 99 
Hawai
'i 244, 254, 54 P.3d 415, 425 (2002) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted) (elaborating on Wong).

5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ragragola-Lenchanko claims "there was no cogent reason for Judge
 
Woo to overturn Judge Ochiai's ruling."
 
Ragragola-Lenchanko misconstrues Judge Ochiai's ruling. 
Judge Ochiai ruled that Ragragola-Lenchanko was to be provided
 
with "the maintenance logs because previously the government has
 
said it's been provided" and "the seven items specifically
 
articulated in Ames. Nothing more, nothing less."
 
In Marsland v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304, 788 P.2d 1281 (1990), 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court ruled that seven of the forty-five 
items requested by the defendant in that case were discoverable. Marsland, 71 Haw. at 310-13, 788 P.2d 1285-86. The Marsland 
court separately noted that the prosecution averred that it had 
already provided some items of discovery, including "maintenance 
logs." Thus, it was unnecessary for the court to rule on this 
item. However, far from ruling that maintenance logs were 
discoverable under HRPP Rule 16, the Marsland court specifically 
held that the following item was not included in discovery 
authorized by this Rule: 
16. A copy of all repair, calibration and maintenance
records and memoranda (including the permanent record book
and repair invoices) for the Intoxilyzer 4011AS used in this
case for the 30 days preceding and 30 days subsequent to the
date of the Defendant's test; and the original records for
the life of the Intoxilyzer 4011AS used in this case to be
made available for inspection and photocopying by
Defendant's attorney. (Citation omitted).
 
Marsland, 71 Haw. at 315, 788 P.2d at 1287. Therefore, Marsland
 
does not stand for the proposition that maintenance logs are
 
discoverable under HRPP Rule 16. Judge Ochiai's order included
 
maintenance logs because "the government has said it's been
 
provided."
 
Nevertheless, on the morning of trial before Judge Woo,
 
the prosecution represented to the trial court that the two
 
maintenance logs relevant to this case were already provided in
 
discovery to Ragragola-Lenchanko, and that it had brought to
 
court that day, for Ragragola-Lenchanko to view, maintenance logs
 
going back ten years. Although Ragragola-Lenchanko related to
 
Judge Woo that there was an "outstanding order to provide the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
maintenance logs for the Intoxilyzer 8000[,]" this was far from
 
clear. Judge Ochiai's order did not specify production of
 
maintenance logs beyond those already provided and Marsland does
 
not require that they be provided at all.
 
On this record, it does not appear that the District
 
Court overturned a previous order. As the previous order did not
 
clearly mandate the production of additional maintenance logs,
 
the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused
 
to grant a continuance to allow Appellant to review additional
 
logs actually produced and to make those logs a part of the
 
record.
 
(5) Ragragola-Lenchanko claims the District Court erred 
by admitting the result of his breath test from the Intoxilyzer. 
His claim that his breath test results should have been 
suppressed because they were unlawfully obtained is without 
merit. State v. Won, 134 Hawai 'i 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014) 
cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014). The State is not required to show compliance with 
manufacturer recommendations to lay a sufficient foundation for 
the admission of test results. State v. Hsu, 129 Hawai
'i 426, 
301 P.3d 426, No. CAAP-10-0000214, 2013 WL 1919514 at *1-2 (App. May 9, 2013) (SDO) cert. denied, SCWC-10-0000214, 2013 WL 4459000 
(Aug. 20, 2013).
5 We also reject Ragragola-Lenchanko's argument 
that the breath test results were admitted in violation of his due process rights and right to discovery. Id., 2013 WL 1919514 
at *2-3; State v. Richardson, 135 Hawai
'i 217, 347 P.3d 1023, No 
CAAP-12-0000775, 2015 WL 1959206 at *3 (App. Apr. 30, 2015) 
(SDO). 
5
 We also reject Ragragola-Lenchanko's claim that the references in
Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 11-114-5(b) with respect to model
specifications of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
and to conforming products lists, do not exist. The references in HAR § 11­114-5(b) are to notices contained in the Federal Register from the United
States Department of Transportation (DOT) NHTSA. For example, Volume 49 of
the Federal Register at pages 48854-48865 contains notices from the DOT NHTSA
dated December 14, 1984, regarding "Highway Safety Programs; Model
Specifications for Calibrating Units for Breath Alcohol Testers; Publication
of Conforming Products List."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, Ragragola-Lenchanko confusingly argues that a 
"'certified letter' purportedly approving the internal standards 
test in lieu of an actual accuracy verification test and the 
Supervisors' Sworn Statements" were improperly admitted. He does 
not identify where in the record the "certified letter" to which 
he refers was admitted into evidence. We therefore deem his 
challenge to this evidence, if it was in fact admitted, waived. 
The "Supervisors' Sworn Statements" appear in the record as 
State's Exhibits 1 and 2. However, contrary to Ragragola­
Lenchanko's argument, the District Court did not merely take 
judicial notice of them, but rather admitted them as self-
authenticating documents. Hawai 'i Rules of Evidence Rule 902 
(1993 and Supp. 2014). 
(6-10) With respect to the denial of Ragragola­
Lenchanko's Motion for New Trial, Motion to Vacate, Correct
 and/or Reduce Sentence (Motion to Correct Sentence), Motion to
 
Arrest Judgment, and Motion for Entry of Order, it appears the
 
District Court denied the motions on the basis that it lacked
 
jurisdiction to rule on the motions once Ragragola-Lenchanko
 
filed a Notice of Appeal on June 28, 2012.
 
"[T]he general rule is that the filing of a notice of 
appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed 
case," State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai
'i 446, 448-49, 923 P.2d 388, 
390-91 (1996) (quoting Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), 76 Hawai
'i 494, 500, 880 P.2d 169, 175 (1994)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted), assuming the notice of appeal is valid. Id., at 449, 923 P.2d at 391 (citing State v. Johnston, 63 Haw. 
9, 619 P.2d 1076 (1980)) ("Where the notice of appeal is 
jurisdictionally defective, filing the notice does not transfer 
jurisdiction from the trial court to the appellate court."). 
"The case law in Hawai
'i is clear that a notice of appeal has no 
effect if filed while a timely tolling motion is pending in the trial court." Richardson, 76 Hawai
'i at 500, 880 P.2d at 175 
(citing Kamaole Two Hui v. Aziz Enterprises, Inc., 9 Haw. App. 566, 571, 854 P.2d 232, 235 (1993)).

Two of Ragragola-Lenchanko's motions, a motion in 
arrest of judgment and a motion for new trial, were tolling 
motions under HRAP Rule 4(b)(2). Both motions must be filed 
within ten days of the finding of guilt. HRPP Rules 33 and 34. 
The finding of guilt was rendered and the judgment entered 
thereon was filed on May 29, 2012. HRAP Rule 4(b)(3). Although 
not filed until June 13, 2012, both motions were stamped 
"Received" by the district court on June 8, 2012, making the 
effective filing date for both motions June 8, 2012. Price v. 
Obayashi Hawaii Corp., 81 Hawai 'i 171, 179, 914 P.2d 1364, 1372 
(1996) (as long as documents are tendered within time period 
prescribed by court rules, the clerks of the court must file 
them). Thus, both were timely filed tolling motions and District 
Court had jurisdiction to decide those motions. Consequently, 
the District Court erred by denying those motions for lack of 
jurisdiction. 
The District Court also had jurisdiction over the
 
Motion to Correct Sentence. The court can correct an illegal
 
sentence at any time, may decide a motion to correct sentence
 
filed within ninety days of the imposition of sentence, and will
 
not be deprived of jurisdiction to decide a motion to reduce
 
sentence by the filing of a notice of appeal. HRPP Rule 35.
 
Ragragola-Lenchanko's Motion to Correct Sentence was timely filed
 
within 90 days of the sentence. Therefore, the District Court
 
also had jurisdiction to rule upon this motion. 
However, the District Court was correct in that it did 
not have jurisdiction to rule upon Ragragola-Lenchanko's Motion 
for Entry of Order. The motion is not a tolling motion and there 
is no authority that excludes it from the general rule that the 
filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of 
jurisdiction over the appealed case. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i at 
448-49, 923 P.2d at 390-91. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the District Court 
of the First Circuit, 'Ewa Division's May 29, 2012, Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment is affirmed.
