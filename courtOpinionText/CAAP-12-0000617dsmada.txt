APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-2345)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
do not have jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-
Appellant Wells Fargo Bank, N.S. as Trustee for Option One
 Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-4 Asset Backed Certificates, Series
 2007-4 (Appellant Wells Fargo), has asserted from the Honorable
 Edwin C. Nacino's June 6, 2012 judgment, because the June 6, 2012
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable 
final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011), Rules 54(b) and 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original 
emphasis). The finding necessary for certification is "an express determination that there is no just reason for delay . . . for the entry of judgment." HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, when a party seeks appellate review of an order that adjudicates one or more but fewer than all of the claims, the "party cannot appeal from [the] circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994) (emphasis 
added). 
The June 6, 2012 judgment purports to enter judgment in
 
favor of Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellee Daniel Tsukasa
 Omiya (Appellee Omiya) and against Appellant Wells Fargo, but the
 June 6, 2012 judgment does not resolve the remaining two sets of
 claims involving (1) Appellant Wells Fargo's complaint against

Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Association of Apartment
 
Owners of Ilikai Apartment Building (Appellee AOAO Ilikai
 Apartment Building) and (2) Appellee Omiya's cross-claim against
 Appellee AOAO Ilikai Apartment Building. Although the June 6,
 2012 judgment does not resolve all claims against all parties,
 the June 6, 2012 judgment does not contain an express finding of
 "no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment" that is
 necessary for a judgment on one or more but fewer than all claims
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b) under the eighteen-year old holding
 in Jenkins. Therefore, under the circumstances, the June 6, 2012
 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP
 Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final
 judgment in this case, Appellant Wells Fargo’s appeal is
 premature and we lack jurisdiction over appellate court case
 number CAAP-12-0000617.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-12-0000617 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
