STATE OF HAWAI
'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 11-1-0004(2))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 30
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On July 6, 2012, Petitioner-Appellant James K. Kong
 
(Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2)
 The record on appeal was filed on October 24, 2012,
 
and the appellate court clerk informed Appellant by mail that the
 
statement of jurisdiction was due by November 13, 2012, and the
 opening brief was due by December 11, 2012;
 
(3) On November 12, 2012, the court granted Appellant’s
 
first requested extension for the statement of jurisdiction and
 opening brief, and extended the due dates for the statement of
 jurisdiction to an unspecified date, and for the opening brief to
 January 11, 2013;

(4) Appellant did not file either document;
 
(5) On March 14, 2013, the appellate court clerk 
informed Appellant by mail that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Rule 30 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure, the matter 
would be called to the court’s attention on March 25, 2013, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; 
(6) Thereafter, Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction or opening brief, or respond to the notice of
 default; and
 
(7) Although the due date for the statement of
 
jurisdiction was unclear, dismissal is warranted, pursuant to
 HRAP Rule 30, for Appellant’s failure to file an opening brief. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 10, 2013.
