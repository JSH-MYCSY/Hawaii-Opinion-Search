OAHU PUBLICATIONS, INC., dba Honolulu Star-Advertiser,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
NEIL ABERCROMBIE, in his official capacity
as Governor of the State of Hawai' i, et al.,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-1871-08)
 
ORDER DENYING JANUARY 6, 2013 HRAP RULE 40
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DECEMBER 27, 2012
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the December 27, 2012 order
 
dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction, (2) Defendant-
Appellant Neil Abercrombie's (Appellant Abercrombie) January 6,
 2013 motion for reconsideration of the December 27, 2012 order
 dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 40 of
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the 
record, it appears that we did not overlook or misapprehend any
 
points of law or fact when we entered the December 27, 2012 order
 dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court
 of Hawai' i explained more than eighteen years ago, 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (citation omitted; emphasis in 
original). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Abercrombie's
 
January 6, 2013 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
 December 27, 2012 order dismissing appeal for lack of
 jurisdiction is denied.
