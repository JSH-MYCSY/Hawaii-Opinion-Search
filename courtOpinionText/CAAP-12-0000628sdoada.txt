IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM D. WHITE, II, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAI'ANAE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-11-070539)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant William D. White, II (White) 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered on June 13, 2012 in the District Court of 
the First Circuit, Wai 'anae Division (District Court).1 
White was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) 
(2007 and Supp. 2013). 
On appeal, White claims the District Court erred by 
admitting a laser gun speed reading because it lacked foundation. 
White argues that without the laser gun reading there was 
insufficient evidence to convict him. 
The State concedes that there was no showing that the 
officer was trained according to the manufacturer's 
recommendations for training on the laser gun and therefore, 
admission of the speed reading lacked foundation. The State also 
agrees that White's conviction should be reversed because without

the speed reading "there is no other evidence indicating the
 
speed Defendant was driving his vehicle[.]"
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve White's point of error as follows:
 
In order to establish a sufficient foundation for the 
admission of a speed reading from a laser gun, theprosecution is required to produce evidence that the "natureand extent of an officer's training in the operation of thelaser gun meets the requirements indicated by themanufacturer." State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 215, 216
P.3d 1227, 1238 (2009). "[T]o meet this burden theprosecution must establish both (1) the requirementsindicated by the manufacturer, and (2) the training actuallyreceived by the operator of the laser gun." [State v.]
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai' i [314,] 327, 288 P.3d [788,] 801
[(2012)]. 
State v. Amiral, 132 Hawai 'i 170, 178, 319 P.3d 1178, 1186 
(2014). 
Based on our review of the record, we agree that the
 
state's concession of error was warranted. Therefore, the laser
 
gun speed reading should not have been admitted over the
 
objection of defense counsel. As there was no other evidence of
 
White's speed, there was insufficient evidence to convict White
 
of Excessive Speeding.
 
THEREFORE, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on June 13, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wai
'anae Division is 
reversed.
