APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Appellee-Appellant State of
 
Hawai'i Land Use Commission (Appellant State LUC) has asserted 
from the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's June 15, 2012 amended
 judgment in favor of Appellants-Appellees DW Aina Le' a, LLC 
(Appellee DWAL), and Bridge Aina Le' a, LLC (Appellee BAL), 
because the June 15, 2012 amended judgment does not satisfy the
 
requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010), Rule 58
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Rule 72(k) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), 
and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 
Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
When a circuit court adjudicates an appeal from an 
administrative agency order, "[r]eview of any final judgment of 
the circuit court under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 
602." HRS § 91-15 (1993). The Hawai' i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS 
§ 602-57(1) (1993 & Supp. 2010). Under Hawai' i law, "[a]ppeals 
shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a 
judgment and the judgment has been entered 
in favor of and 
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). 
Thus, in a consolidated circuit court civil case, the circuit court must enter a single judgment that resolves all claims as to 
all parties in all of the cases that the circuit court has 
consolidated, unless the circuit court certifies the judgment (on 
fewer than all claims) for appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). 
See, e.g., Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 109 Hawai' i 8, 13, 122 
P.3d 803, 808 (2005) ("[A] judgment or order in a consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is 
not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) 
certification."). HRCP Rule 72(k) similarly requires that, upon 
a circuit court's adjudication of an administrative appeal, "the 
court having jurisdiction shall enter judgment." HRCP 
Rule 72(k). Therefore, the separate judgment document rule under 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the holding in Jenkins applies to a secondary appeal from a 
circuit court order that adjudicates an administrative appeal. 
See, e.g., Raquinio v. Nakanelua, 77 Hawai' i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 
76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth in Jenkins apply to appeals from circuit 
court orders deciding appeals from orders entered by the Director 
of Labor and Industrial Relations."). When explaining the 
requirements for an appealable judgment under the separate 
document rule, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "[W]e should not 
make such searches necessary by allowing the parties the option 
of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n 
appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against 
all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification 
under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id., (emphasis added). 
Although the circuit court reduced its final decision 
in the consolidated administrative appeals in Civil Nos. 11-1­
0112K and 11-1-0969-05 to the June 15, 2012 amended judgment in 
favor of Appellees DWAL and BAL, the June 15, 2012 amended 
judgment neither enters judgment on, nor dismisses the 
consolidated circuit court administrative appeals as to, three 
named parties: Appellees-Appellees State of Hawai' i Office of 
Planning, County of Hawai' i Planning Agency, and County of 
Hawai'i. Although the June 15, 2012 amended judgment closes with 
a statement that declares that there are no remaining claims, parties or issues in this matter, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
has explained that, 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,

"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Although the June 15, 2012 amended judgment 
does not does not expressly resolve the consolidated 
administrative appeals as to all of the named parties, the 
June 15, 2012 amended judgment does not contain an express 
finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment on 
one or more but fewer than all claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 
54(b). Therefore, the June 15, 2012 amended judgment does not 
satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under 
HRCP Rule 58, HRCP Rule 72(k), and the holding in Jenkins. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, this appeal is premature and 
we lack jurisdiction. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DECREED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-12-0000629 is dismissed for lack of
 
jurisdiction.
