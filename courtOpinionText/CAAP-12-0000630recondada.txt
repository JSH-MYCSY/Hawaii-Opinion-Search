(2) Defendant-Appellant Kevin Collman's (Appellant Collman) 
November 14, 2012 motion for reconsideration of the October 30, 2012 order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears that Appellant Collman did not file his November 14, 2012 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration within ten days after the filing of the October 30, 2012 order, as HRAP Rule 40(a) requires, and, thus, Appellant Collman's November 14, 2012 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration is untimely under HRAP Rule 40(a). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we deny Appellant Collman's
 
November 14, 2012 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
 October 30, 2012 order which dismissed this appeal for lack of
 jurisdiction.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 21, 2012.
