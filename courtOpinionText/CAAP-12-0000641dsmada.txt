(1) On July 16, 2012, Appellant, then proceeding pro
 
se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) The record on appeal was filed on November 30,
 
2012, and the appellate court clerk informed Appellant that the
 statement of jurisdiction was due by December 10, 2012, and the
 opening brief was due by January 9, 2013; 
(3) Appellant did not file a statement of jurisdiction;
 (4) On December 16, 2012, the appellate court clerk
 
granted Appellant an extension until February 8, 2013, to file
 the opening brief;
 
(5) Appellant did not file an opening brief;
 (6) On March 4, 2013, the appellate court clerk 
informed Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Rule 30 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure, the matter would 
be called to the court’s attention on March 25, 2013, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; 
(7) Counsel entered an appearance on March 21, 2013;

reflects Appellant timely sought and received from the appellate
 
court clerk the first extension for the opening brief in this
 appeal, and Appellant has successfully managed pro se about ten
 (10) different appeals in this court, having requested and
 obtained extensions of time to file opening briefs on numerous
 occasions; and 
(9) Appellant fails to demonstrate good cause why he
 
should be relieved from default of the statement of jurisdiction
 and opening brief. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed.
