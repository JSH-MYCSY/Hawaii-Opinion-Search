STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CRAIG A. GOMEZ, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Ewa Division)
(CASE NO. 1DTC-12-040907)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Craig A. Gomez (Gomez) by complaint with
 
Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been
 Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence
 of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp. 2014). The
 complaint also alleged that Gomez was subject to sentencing as a
 repeat offender under HRS § 291E-62(b)(2) (Supp. 2014).
1 After a
 
1HRS § 291E-62 provides in relevant part:
 
(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted
pursuant to this section or to part III or section 291E-61 or
291E-61.5, or to part VII or part XIV of chapter 286 or section
(continued...)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
bench trial, the District Court of the First Circuit (District
 
2
Court) found Gomez guilty as charged.  The District Court
 
sentenced Gomez to thirty days in jail, and it imposed a $1,000
 
fine and revoked his license for two years. The District Court
 entered its Judgment on June 20, 2012, and this appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Gomez argues: (1) the District Court erred
 
in granting the State's motion to amend the OVLPSR-OVUII charge;
 (2) the District Court erred in (a) admitting the Driver's
 License Letter (Exhibit 1) without testimony by its author,
 because based on 
Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts,  557 U.S. 305
 
1(...continued)
200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or 291-7 as those provisions were
in effect on December 31, 2001, shall operate or assume actual
physical control of any vehicle:
 
(1)	 In violation of any restrictions placed on the
person's license; [or]
 
(2)	 While the person's license or privilege to operate a
vehicle remains suspended or revoked; . . .
 
. . . . 
(b) Any person convicted of violating this section shall
be sentenced as follows without possibility of probation or
suspension of sentence:
 
. . . .
 
(2)	 For an offense that occurs within five years of a
prior conviction for an offense under this section,
section 291E-66, or section 291-4.5 as that section
was in effect on December 31, 2001: 
(A)	 Thirty days imprisonment; 
(B)	 A $1,000 fine; 
(C)	 Revocation of license and privilege to operate a
vehicle for an additional two years; and 
(D)	 Loss of the privilege to operate a vehicle
equipped with an ignition interlock device, if
applicable; . . .
 
. . . . 
(c) The applicable period of revocation in subsection (b)
shall commence upon the release of the person from the period of
imprisonment imposed pursuant to this section.

(2009), this violated Gomez's rights under the Sixth Amendment's
 
Confrontation Clause; and (b) admitting the Judgment in Case No.
 1DTC-11-059870 (Exhibit 2) and the traffic abstract (Exhibit 3),
 because they were not relevant; and (3) without Exhibits 1, 2,
 and 3, there was insufficient evidence to support Gomez's OVLPSR­OVUII conviction.
 
As explained below, we conclude that: (1) the District
 
Court did not err in permitting the State to amend the OVLPSR­OVUII charge; (2) based on Melendez-Diaz, the District Court
 erred in admitting Exhibit 1 because the admission of that
 exhibit violated Gomez's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights;
 (3) the Circuit Court did not err in admitting Exhibits 2 and 3;
 and (4) based on the properly admitted evidence, there was
 sufficient evidence to support Gomez's conviction. We further
 conclude, however, that in seeking to prove the essential element
 that Gomez drove while his license remained suspended or revoked,
 the State erroneously focused and relied on the Judgment in Case
 No. 1DTC-11-059870, which did not show that Gomez's license was
 suspended or revoked at the time of the OVLPSR-OVUII offense
 charged in this case. Because of the manner in which the State
 presented its case, the District Court's apparent erroneous
 reliance on the Judgment in Case No. 1DTC-11-059870 in finding
 that Gomez's license was revoked at the time of the charged
 offense, and the uncertainty over whether the District Court
 would have made the same finding based on other properly admitted
 evidence, we vacate Gomez's OVLPSR-OVUII conviction and remand
 for a new trial.
 
I.
 
In this case, Gomez was charged with OVLPSR-OVUII for
 
operating a vehicle on February 15, 2012. In order to establish
 the charged offense, the State was required to prove that on
 February 15, 2012, Gomez's license remained suspended or revoked
 pursuant to one of the OVUII-related provisions set forth in HRS
 § 291E-62. See note 1, supra. At trial, the State introduced
 
Exhibit 2, which was a criminal Judgment against Gomez, filed on
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
January 24, 2012, in Case No. 1DTC-11-059870 (1DTC-11-059870
 
Judgment). The 1DTC-11-059870 Judgment reflected that Gomez had
 been convicted of OVLPSR-OVUII and sentenced on January 24, 2012,
 to three days in jail, which was to be executed on February 17,
 2012, as well as license revocation for one year. The State also
 introduced Exhibit 3, a traffic abstract for Gomez, which
 included references to Case No. 1DTC-11-059870 and reflected that
 Gomez's jail term imposed on January 24, 2012, was executed on
 February 17, 2012. The traffic abstract, which was twenty-eight
 pages long, also referenced an administrative revocation
 proceeding, pursuant to HRS 291E Part 3, and indicated that
 Gomez's license was revoked in that proceeding for 18 months on
 September 2, 2011.
 
In closing argument, the State argued to the District
 
Court that the 1DTC-11-059870 Judgment regarding Gomez's prior
 OVLPSR-OVUII conviction showed that Gomez was on notice that his
 license was revoked at the time of the current offense, when he
 drove on February 15, 2012. The problem with this argument is
 that HRS § 291E-62, the statute that defines the OVLPSR-OVUII
 offense, specifically provides that the applicable period of
 revocation for an OVLPSR-OVUII conviction "shall commence upon
 the release of the person from the period of imprisonment
 imposed[.]" HRS § 291E-62(c). Because the 1DTC-11-059870
 Judgment stayed execution of Gomez's term of imprisonment until 
February 17, 2012, his driver's license was not revoked pursuant
 to the 1DTC-11-059870 Judgment at the time he drove in this case. 
The State did not mention the administrative revocation
 proceeding listed in the traffic abstract, which the traffic
 abstract indicated resulted in the revocation of Gomez's license
 for 18 months on September 2, 2011.
 
In rendering its verdict, the District Court focused on
 
the 1DTC-11-059870 Judgment. The State directed the District
 Court to pages 3 and 4 of Gomez's traffic abstract, which 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
referenced the case underlying the 1DTC-11-059870 Judgment. The
 
District Court also stated:
 
That on January 24th 2012[,] Craig Anthony Gomez pled no
contest to the offense of, uh, of 291E-62(A), Driving After
License Suspended for Driving Under the Influence, and was
-- and was sentenced by Judge Lono Lee on that day. The
 court also finds that per -- that defendant was -- was, um
-- also finds from Exhibit 2 that judgment and notice of
entry of judgment was entered by the District Court First
Circuit, State of Hawaii.
 
The District Court subsequently stated that "based on the
 
evidence adduced, the court finds that the State has proven its
 case beyond a reasonable doubt." The District Court did not
 mention any administrative revocation of Gomez's license in
 rendering its verdict.
 
Under these circumstances, because of the manner in
 
which the State presented its case, the District Court's apparent
 erroneous reliance on the 1DTC-11-059870 Judgment in finding that
 Gomez's license was revoked at the time of the charged offense,
 and the uncertainty over whether the District Court would have
 made the same finding based on other properly admitted evidence,
 we vacate Gomez's conviction.

II.
 
With respect to the other issues raised in this case,
 
we rule as follows:
 
1. The District Court did not err in granting the 
State's motion to amend the OVLPSR-OVUII charge. State v. Kam, 
134 Hawai 'i 280, 284-87, 339 P.3d 1081, 1085-88 (2014). 
2. Based on Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. 305, the District
 
Court erred in admitting Exhibit 1, the Driver's License Letter,
 because the admission of the letter without testimony by its
 author violated Gomez's rights under the Sixth Amendment's
 
3We view the unusual situation presented by this case to be somewhat
analogous to the situation in which a trial court improperly admits evidence
over the defendant's objection and relies on that evidence in returning a
guilty verdict. In this latter situation, even if the properly admitted
evidence is sufficient to support the conviction, we would vacate the
conviction under the harmless error analysis if we could not say that the
trial court's error in admitting the improper evidence was harmless.

Confrontation Clause. State v. Souleng, --- P.3d ---, No. CAAP­
12-0000196, 2015 WL 291341, at *4-7 (Hawai 'i App. Jan. 22, 2015). 
3. The District Court did not err in admitting
 
Exhibits 2 and 3. Contrary to Gomez's claim, the State presented
 
sufficient evidence to show that he was the "Craig Gomez" named
 in these exhibits. Among other things, the State showed that
 Gomez's name, date of birth, and last four digits of his social
 security number matched the information contained in Exhibits 2
 and 3. Exhibits 2 and 3 were clearly relevant as they contained
 evidence of Gomez's prior traffic convictions and periods of
 license revocation -- evidence that tended to prove the OVLPSR­OVUII offense charged in this case.
 
4. Even without considering Exhibit 1, the other
 
properly admitted evidence, when viewed in the light most
 favorable to the State, was sufficient to show that Gomez had
 committed the charged OVLPSR-OVUII offense. Gomez does not argue
 otherwise, but only contends that without Exhibits 1, 2, and 3,
 the evidence was insufficient. 
III.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Judgment
 
entered by the District Court in this case, and we remand the
 case for a new trial.
