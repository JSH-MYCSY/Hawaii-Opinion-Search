NO. CAAP-12-0000648
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF ETHEL CAMACHO, Deceased
 
IN THE MATTER OF THE ETHEL CAMACHO
 
LIVING TRUST DATED MARCH 3, 2008
 
NEPHI DANIEL IOANE CAMACHO, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
BEVERLY J. CALKOVSKY, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(PROBATE NO. 08-1-0192)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Respondent-Appellant Beverly J.
 
Calkovsky (Appellant Calkovsky) has asserted from the Honorable
 Patrick W. Border's June 21, 2012 "Final Judgement on Nephi
 Daniel Ioane Camacho's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs for
 His 'Good Faith' Defense of the Last Will and Testament of Ethel
 Camacho Dated November 2, 1998" (the June 21, 2012 award of
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and costs), because it is not independently
 
appealable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 &
 Supp. 2012), Rule 34(a) of the Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR), and 
Rule 54(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
HRS § 641-1(a) expressly authorizes appeals from civil circuit
 court final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS
 § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules
 of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The relevant rule of the probate
 court, HPR Rule 34(a), requires the probate court to reduce
 orders to a separate judgment as a prerequisite for
 appealability:
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions
.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphasis added). HPR "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see,
 e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the 
timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Commentary to HPR Rule 34 in Michie's Court Rules (2013). Under the holding in Jenkins, "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n 
appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. For example, "a judgment or order 
in a consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 109 Hawai' i 
8, 13, 122 P.3d 803, 808 (2005). Furthermore, whenever HRCP Rule 54(b) certification is necessary, "a party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 
Hawai'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994). "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339. 
Although Appellant Calkovsky purports to be appealing
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from the June 21, 2012 award of attorneys' fees and costs, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained that "such an order is not 
a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." Fujimoto 
v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 (2001) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, "[a] circuit court's order awarding attorneys' fees and costs may not be certified as a final judgment, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), because such an order is not a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." Id. (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). "The entry of judgment and taxation of costs are separate legal acts." CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., 
Inc., 95 Hawai' i 301, 307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) (citation, 
internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). "Absent entry of an appealable final judgment on the claims . . . [to which an award of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of attorneys' fees and costs is . . . not appealable." Fujimoto v. 
Au, 95 Hawai' i at 123, 19 P.3d at 706; CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond 
Co., Inc., 95 Hawai' i at 306, 22 P.3d at 102 ("Similarly, the 
September 23, 1999 Order [awarding only attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment [awarding only attorneys' fees] are not appealable, and we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review them."). Therefore, the June 21, 2012 award of attorneys' fees and costs in this case is not eligible for appellate review unless it relates to an appealable final judgment on the substantive claims. 
The judgement on the claims to which the June 21, 2012
 
award of attorneys' fees and costs relates is the Honorable
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Patrick W. Border's April 2, 2012 judgment in the consolidated 
cases of Probate No. 08-1-0192 and Trust No. 08-1-0094. Although the circuit court (rather than the probate court) entered the April 2, 2012 judgment, HPR Rule 20(f) provides that whenever a probate court assigns a contested matter to the circuit court civil calendar, "[a]n order resolving the issues in a contested matter shall be reduced to judgment in accordance with Rule 34 of these rules and may be appealed as provided therein." Despite that the circuit court entered a December 5, 2011 order consolidating Probate No. 08-1-0192 and Trust No. 08-1-0094 under Probate No. 08-1-0192, the April 2, 2012 judgment does not, on its face, either expressly resolve all claims from both of the consolidated cases or contain the finding necessary for HRCP Rule 54(b) certification, when, under the separate document rule, "a judgment or order in a consolidated case, disposing of fewer than all claims among all parties, is not appealable in the absence of [HRCP] Rule 54(b) certification." Leslie v. Estate of 
Tavares, 109 Hawai' i at 13, 122 P.3d at 808. More importantly, 
however, the April 2, 2012 judgment did not finally end all of the proceedings in Probate No. 08-1-0192, which appear to be ongoing, and, thus, under the requirements for an appealable HPR Rule 34 judgment, the April 2, 2012 judgment would be appealable only if it were "certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure." HPR 
Rule 34(a). As already stated, the April 2, 2012 judgment does not contain the express finding necessary for HRCP Rule 54(b) certification. 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Neither the April 2, 2012 judgment nor the June 21,
 
2012 award of attorneys' fees and costs is eligible for appellate
 
review under HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34(a). Absent an
 appealable final judgment or a judgment properly certified under
 HRCP Rule 54(b), we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case
 and Appellant Calkovsky's appeal is premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-12-0000648 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
