NO. CAAP-12-0000649
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHRISTOPHER Z. RESICH, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(Case No. 1DTA-11-01076)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Christopher Z. Resich (Resich)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on June 21, 2012 in the District Court of
 
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1
 
A charge against Resich for Operating a Vehicle Under 
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2014) was 
dismissed without prejudice for violation of Rule 48 of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). 
As his sole issue on appeal, Resich contends the
 
District Court erred by dismissing the charge without prejudice
 
instead of with prejudice.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Resich's point of error as follows:
 
[I]n determining whether to dismiss a charge with or without
prejudice under HRPP Rule 48(b), the trial court must not
only consider the Estencion[ 2
] factors, but must also
clearly articulate the effect of the 
Estencion factors and
any other factor it considered in rendering its decision.
 
State v. Hern, 133 Hawai 'i 59, 64, 323 P.3d 1241, 1246 (App. 
2013). "The trial court's explanation of its consideration of 
the Estencion factors and the basis for its decision will permit 
meaningful appellate review." Id. at 65, 323 P.3d at 1247. 
However, Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
10(b)(1)(A) (2011) places on the appellant the affirmative burden 
of providing the transcript of the proceedings: 
When an appellant desires to raise any point on appeal that
requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the
court or agency appealed from, the appellant shall file with
the appellate clerk, within 10 days after filing the notice
of appeal, a request or requests to prepare a reporter’s
transcript of such parts of the proceedings as the appellant
deems necessary that are not already on file.
 
Thus, it is well settled that "'[t]he burden is upon appellant in 
an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, 
and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate 
transcript.'" Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai 'i 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (brackets omitted) (quoting Union Bldg. 
Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp.
, 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 
P.2d 82, 87 (1984)). Because Resich's claim that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss without prejudice 
depends on a review of the court's oral decision, the factual 
basis for his alleged point of error is not part of the record.

Appellate courts "will not presume error from a silent record." 
State v. Hoang
, 93 Hawai 'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on June 21, 2012
 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is
 
affirmed.

Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 29, 2015.
