OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WESLEY KOBAYASHI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(Case No. 1DTA-12-00560)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Wesley Kobayashi (Kobayashi)
 
appeals from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment,
 
entered on July 2, 2012 in the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court),  in which the
District Court dismissed the charges of Operating a Vehicle Under
 
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2014)
 
and No Motor vehicle Insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C­
104(a) (2005) without prejudice.
 
On appeal, Kobayashi contends that the District Court

 
erred by (1) failing to provide specific findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law to support dismissal of the charges without
 
prejudice and (2) dismissing the charges without prejudice
 
instead of with prejudice.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kobayashi's points of error as follows:
 
The record on appeal does not contain a transcript of 
the July 2, 2012 proceeding in which the District Court dismissed 
this case. Because the District Court's factual findings may be 
made either orally or in writing, it was Kobayashi's burden on 
appeal to prove that the District Court failed to comply with 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12(e) to make 
findings of fact orally or in writing. See State v. Hoang, 93 
Hawai'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) (it is appellant's 
burden of demonstrating error in the record). Although, the written record is silent as to the basis for dismissing the 
charges, written findings were not required. See State v. Hern, 
133 Hawai
'i 59, 323 P.3d 1241 (App. 2013) (holding in the context 
of an HRPP Rule 48(b) motion that the trial court should have 
articulated the factors it considered in dismissing a charge with 
or without prejudice, but reviewing the transcript).2 "[W]e will 
not presume error from a silent record." Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i at 
336, 3 P.3d at 502. Because the factual basis of Kobayashi's 
alleged point of error, that the District Court made no findings, 
either orally or in writing, "is not part of the record on 
appeal, this court has no basis upon which to rule on the merits 
of his claim." Id. 
In addition, the record is silent as to the arguments
 
Kobayashi advanced, if any, for dismissing the charges with
 
prejudice. Without a transcript, Kobayashi has failed to carry
 
2
 Kobayashi made a post-judgment request for findings of fact and
conclusions of law, relying on Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule
(HRAP) Rule 10(f). The District Court's failure to enter findings of fact and
conclusions of law pursuant to such a request was not erroneous. HRAP Rule 10(f) applies to "actions where the court appealed from is not required toenter findings of fact and conclusions of law prior to entry of an order,judgment, or decree, but is required to do so once a notice of appeal isfiled, . . . ." HRAP Rule 10(f) is inapplicable.

his burden of proving an error by the District Court in
 
dismissing the charges without prejudice.

 
Therefore, 
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment and Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment, entered on July 2, 2012 in the District Court 
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
