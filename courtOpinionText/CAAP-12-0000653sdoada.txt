IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CELESTE MANDERVILLE, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
RALPH D. BLACK, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1RC12-1-994)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ralph Black (Black) appeals from an
 
Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
 
filed on July 2, 2012, by the District Court of the First
 Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court).
1
 
The case arises from Plaintiff-Appellee Celeste 
Manderville's (Manderville) claim that she paid Black a $2,500 deposit for legal services, but that Black did not perform the services and refuses to reimburse the moneys paid. Manderville filed a complaint against Black on February 16, 2012. Rather than personally serving the complaint and summons on Black, Manderville sent a certified copy of the complaint and summons to Black via certified mail at his P.O. Box address on the Island of Lana
'i. Black did not appear at a March 12, 2012 hearing and the 
district court thereupon entered default judgment against Black.

On appeal, Black contends that service upon him was
 
defective and thus the district court erred in not setting aside
 
the default judgment as void under District Court Rules of Civil
 Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60(b)(4) (2006).
2 Manderville, on the
 
other hand, argues that service on Black was proper under
 applicable statutes.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Black's
 point of error as follows.
 
The default judgment in this case is void because 
service of the complaint and summons upon Black by certified mail is not permitted under DCRCP Rule 4(d) (1996) or any applicable statute. For a trial court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, a defendant must be properly served a copy of the summons and complaint. See Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 430, 16 P.3d 827, 835 (App. 2000) 
(regarding service under Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 4(d), which is substantially similar to DCRCP Rule 4(d)). 
DCRCP Rule 4(d) provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 4. Process
 
. . .
 
(d) Same: Personal service.  The summons and complaint
shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the
 
2 DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4) states in relevant part:
 
Rule 60. Relief From Judgment or Order
. . .
 (b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc.  On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or the
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (4) the
judgment is void[.]

 In the district court's written order denying Black's motion to set
aside the default judgment, the basis for the order is stated to be that"neglect by defendant Ralph Black, who is an attorney, was not excusable."However, at the July 2, 2012 hearing on the motion, the district court alsoindicated its belief that service by certified mail was allowed pursuant toHawai'i Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 634-36 (1993).

person making service with such copies as are necessary.
Service shall be made as follows:
 (1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an
incompetent person, (i) by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to that individual personally or in
case the individual cannot be found by leaving copies
thereof at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of
abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then
residing therein or (ii) by delivering a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment
or by law to receive service of process.
 
. . .
 (8) Upon a defendant of any class referred to in paragraph
(1) or (3) of this subdivision of this rule, it is also
sufficient if the summons and complaint are served in the
manner prescribed by any statute.
 
DCRCP Rule 4(d)(1) sets forth the requirements under
 
the rule for service of process on an individual. The parties do
 
not dispute that DCRCP Rule 4(d)(1) does not allow for service by
 certified mail.
 
The parties dispute, however, whether service by
 
certified mail is allowed pursuant to DCRCP Rule 4(d)(8) and, as
 referenced therein, applicable statutes. Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 634-36 (1993) provides in pertinent part:
 
§634-36 Manner of service under sections 634-33 to 36.
When service of summons is provided for by section 634-33,
634-34, or 634-35, service shall be made by service upon the
defendant personally by any person authorized to serve
process in the place in which the defendant may be found or
appointed by the court for the purpose, or sent by
certified, registered, or express mail, postage prepaid,
with return receipt requested, by the plaintiff or the
plaintiff's attorney to the defendant. The plaintiff or the
plaintiff's attorney shall file the return of the serving
officer or an affidavit showing that the copy of summons and
complaint were served as aforesaid or sent by certified,
registered, or express mail as aforesaid, and in the latter
case the return receipt signed by the defendant shall be
filed with the affidavit. The service shall be complete upon
delivery of the required papers to the defendant outside the
State, personally or by mail as provided.
 
(Emphasis added). As indicated, in order for HRS § 634-36 to
 
apply, it must be triggered via HRS §§ 634-33, 634-34, or 634-35. 
It is undisputed that neither HRS §§ 634-33 nor 634-34 are
 relevant to this case, and therefore the key question is whether
 HRS § 634-35 triggers application of HRS § 634-36 in this case. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
It does not. HRS § 634-35 is Hawaii's long-arm statute and, as
 
to service of process it provides:
 
[§634-35] Acts submitting to jurisdiction. . . .
 
(b) Service of process upon any person who is subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State, as provided
in this section, may be made as provided by section 634-36,
if the person cannot be found in the State, with the same
force and effect as though summons had been personally
served within this State.
 
HRS § 634-35(b) (emphasis added). The record shows that Black 
was within the State and could be found on the Island of Lana 'i 
when Manderville sought to effect service upon him. 
We further note that HRS § 604-7(c) (Supp. 2012)
 
provides that:
 
§604-7 Power; venue. . . .
 
(c) A summons or other writ issued by a district
court may be served anywhere within the State. A summons or
other writ issued by a district court may be served 
without
the State in accordance with section 634-24, 634-25, 634-34,
634-35, or 634-36.
 
(Emphasis added). This statute further underscores that HRS 
§ 634-36 applies to service of process outside the State of Hawai
'i. 
Even though it appears that Black signed a receipt for 
the certified mailing of the complaint and summons, this did not cure the jurisdictional defect caused by the improper service of process. Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai
'i 
190, 198, 268 P.3d 443, 451 (App. 2011). 
Finally, Manderville argues that Black's inexcusable
 
neglect "constitutes legitimate legal grounds for the Court's
 denial of [Black's] Rule 60(b) motion." This Court, however,
 
4
previously held that it does not consider the BDM  test,  in which
inexcusable neglect is a factor, "where the default judgment was
 
4
 Under the BDM test, to grant a Motion to Set Aside a Default
 
Judgment, the court generally must find 
(1) that the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by
the reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a
meritorious defense, and (3) that the default was not the
result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.

void due to lack of service of process." Wagner, 126 Hawai 'i at 
196, 268 P.3d at 449. Manderville's argument is thus without 
merit. 
The district court lacked personal jurisdiction over 
Black because Black was not properly served a copy of the complaint and summons pursuant to DCRCP Rule 4(d) or applicable statutes. When a court lacks personal jurisdiction over the parties, the judgment is void. In re Genesys Data Techs., Inc., 
95 Hawai
'i 33, 38, 18 P.3d 895, 900 (2001). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Denying
 
Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment filed on July 2,
 2012, and the Default Judgment, filed on March 20, 2012, in the
 District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division are
 vacated. The case is remanded to the district court for further
 proceedings.
