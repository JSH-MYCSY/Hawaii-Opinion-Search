NO. CAAP-12-0000654
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
YOSHIRO SANNEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-1570)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Yoshiro Sanney appeals from the
 
June 21, 2012 "Order Summarily Denying Defendant's Motion to
 
Reconsider Sentence" entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court).  Sanney's sole point on appeal is that
 
the circuit court erred in not holding a hearing on the motion.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Sanney's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Sanney cites to no authority that would have entitled 
him to a hearing on his motion pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 35(b), and we find none. Sanney argues he could

have brought matters to the attention of the circuit court if he
 
had a hearing but does not explain why these matters could not
 
have been brought to the attention of the court in his motion for
 
reconsideration or by written submittal in support of his motion. 
The sole basis of Sanney's motion was a declaration of his
 
counsel that since Sanney had been sentenced to prison "he has
 
had a lot of time to reflect about the incidents that occurred in
 
this case" and "would like another opportunity to address the
 
court regarding his sentence."2
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the June 21, 2012 "Order
 
Summarily Denying Defendant's Motion to Reconsider Sentence"
 entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.

 After the motion to reconsider was filed, Sanney's counsel
withdrew and substitute counsel was appointed on January 25, 2012. No further
 
documents were filed in support of the motion.
