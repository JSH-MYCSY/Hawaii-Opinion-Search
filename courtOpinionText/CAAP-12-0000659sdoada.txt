Defendant-Appellant Justin Shintani Kua (Kua) appeals

June 25, 2012, in the District Court of the Third Circuit, North

1 The Honorable Harry P. Freitas presided.
 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a) provides:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and
guard against casualty;
 
(continued...)

In the district court, Kua filed a motion to suppress
 
any evidence that was recovered as a result of a non-consensual
 
blood draw conducted pursuant to HRS § 291E-21 (2007). Under
 this statute, in order for a police officer to obtain a non-
consensual blood draw from the operator of a vehicle, there must
 have been a "collision resulting in injury to or the death of any
 person[.]" HRS § 291E-21(a) and (c). The district court denied
 Kua's motion to suppress. Kua thereafter entered a Conditional
 No Contest Plea and was convicted.
 
On appeal, Kua contends the district court erred by
 
denying his motion to suppress because there was no evidence of a
 "collision" within the meaning of HRS § 291E-21, and thus he
 should not have been subjected to a non-consensual blood draw. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kua's point of error as follows and vacate his
 conviction.
 
The district court ruled on Kua's motion to suppress
 
based on stipulated facts filed by the parties. The stipulated
 
facts provide, inter alia, that:
 
1.	 On or about August 28, 2011, Officer Jensen
Rodrigues was dispatched to a major traffic
accident on Kanoelehua Avenue and East Kawili
 Street;
 
. . . .
 
3.	 Upon arrival, Officer Jensen Rodrigues observed
a Toyota Tacoma Truck that was overturned onto
its side;
 
2(...continued)
(2) While under the influence of any drug that impairs
the person's ability to operate the vehicle in a
careful and prudent manner;
 (3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred
ten liters of breath; or
 (4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.

4.	 The Toyota Tacoma appeared to have executed a
left turn from East Kawili Street onto
 Kanoelehua Avenue, lost control and turned onto
the driver’s side of the truck;
 
5.	 The Toyota Tacoma never made contact or struck
 any object prior to coming to rest on its side,
except for the roadway;
 
6.	 Defendant Justin Kua was in the bottom of the
 cab near the driver’s side window and was
 observed by Officer Rodrigues to climb out of
the window of the truck;
 
. . . .
 
13.	 Defendant was transported to Hilo Medical Center
by EMS personnel for his injuries;
 
14.	 Defendant was arrested for Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant and a
 mandatory blood draw was conducted under Hawaii
Revised Statutes 291E-21[.]
 
Based on the stipulated facts, there was no evidence 
that Kua's vehicle collided with another object. State v. 
Williams, 114 Hawai 'i 406, 410, 163 P.3d 1143, 1147 (2007) 
("Although single-vehicle accidents may qualify as collisions, in 
such a case the vehicle must nevertheless 'collide' with another object." (citation omitted)). The State argues that the collision requirement of HRS § 291E-21 was satisfied when Kua's vehicle collided with the road. However, this argument was rejected in State v. Bayly, 118 Hawai
'i 1, 12, 185 P.3d 186, 197 
(2008). Although Bayly dealt with a different statute, it relied on Williams and is sufficiently analogous. 
Without evidence that Kua's vehicle collided with 
another object, HRS § 291E-21 did not allow for a non-consensual blood draw to be obtained from Kua. Williams, 114 Hawai
'i at 
411, 163 P.3d at 1148. The district court thus erred in denying Kua's motion to suppress. Id. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order, filed on June 25, 2012, in the District
 Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Division is
 vacated and the order denying Kua's motion to suppress is
 reversed. The case is remanded to the district court with

instructions to grant Kua's motion to suppress and to allow Kua 
to withdraw his plea pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 11(a)(2).
