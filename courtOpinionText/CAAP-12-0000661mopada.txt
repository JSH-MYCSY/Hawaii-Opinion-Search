  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Endo seeks review of the following orders
 
and judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit2
 
(circuit court): (1) June 29, 2012 Order Granting IUPAT's Motion
 
to Confirm and to Enforce Arbitration Decision and Award;
 (2) July 10, 2012 Order Denying Endo's Motion to Vacate
 Arbitration Decision and Award; (3) July 30, 2012 Judgment; and
 (4) November 19, 2012 Order Granting IUPAT's Motion for Allowance
 of Costs and Attorneys' Fees. 
In turn, IUPAT appeals from the circuit court's
 
February 25, 2013 Order Denying IUPAT's Motion for a Final
 Judgment to Include the Specific Amount of Attorneys' Fees and
 
Costs Ordered on November 19, 2012.

I. Background
 
On January 30, 2008, Endo became a signatory contractor
 
to the "LABOR AGREEMENT & RELATED DOCUMENTS By and Between
 
PAINTING AND DECORATING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF HAWAII and
 INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES Local Union
 1791, AFL-CIO," a collective bargaining agreement between IUPAT
 and the Painting and Decorating Contractors Association of Hawaii
 (Association), which sets forth the wages, hours, and other terms
 and conditions of employment for IUPAT members (the CBA). The
 CBA requires all disputes regarding the application,
 interpretation or alleged violation of the CBA to proceed through
 a grievance procedure that results in a final and binding
 decision by a Joint Industry Committee (JIC) or an arbitrator. 
In March 2011, IUPAT submitted a class action grievance against
 Endo, alleging improper cash payments to employees and violations
 of job safety requirements. The grievance was submitted to the
 JIC and a hearing was held. The JIC voted unanimously in favor
 of IUPAT and issued a written decision on April 29, 2011.

 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.

 In CAAP-12-661, IUPAT filed a cross-appeal related to the
November 19, 2012 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part [IUPAT's] Motion
for Allowance of Costs and Attorneys' Fees. However, IUPAT failed to file an
opening brief on this cross-appeal and therefore the cross-appeal is waived.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Almost a year later, on April 23, 2012, after receiving
 
complaints that Endo was not complying with the arbitration
 
decision, IUPAT filed a "Motion to Confirm and to Enforce
 Arbitration Decision and Award" (Motion to Confirm) in the
 circuit court. Endo filed an opposition to the Motion to Confirm
 on May 9, 2012, and then filed a "Motion to Vacate Arbitration
 Decision and Award" (Motion to Vacate) which was file-stamped the
 same day as the May 17, 2012 hearing on IUPAT's Motion to
 Confirm. The circuit court granted IUPAT's Motion to Confirm,
 denied Endo's Motion to Vacate, and subsequently entered a July
 30, 2012 Judgment ordering Endo to comply with the remedial terms
 of the JIC decision and award.
 
On August 10, 2012, IUPAT filed a post-judgment "Motion
 
for Allowance of Costs and Attorneys' Fees" (Motion for
 Fees/Costs), which the circuit court purported to grant by a
 November 19, 2012 written order. On December 20, 2012, IUPAT
 filed a post-judgment "Motion for a Final Judgment to Include the
 Specific Amount of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Ordered on November
 19, 2012" (Motion for Final Judgment). The circuit court denied
 IUPAT's Motion for Final Judgment and ruled that its November 19,
 2012 order granting attorneys' fees and costs was null and void.
 
In its appeal in CAAP–12-661 and CAAP-12-1094, Endo
 
contends that the circuit court erred by: (1) confirming the
 arbitration award, because the award violated certain
 requirements in the CBA and Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A­19 (Supp. 2014); (2) concluding that Endo's motion to vacate for
 fraud could not be granted after the award was confirmed, and by
 failing to review the motion to vacate under HRS § 658A-23 (Supp.
 2014); and (3) purporting to grant IUPAT's motion for attorneys'
 fees and costs. Further, Endo argues generally that federal law
 preempted application of HRS Chapter 658A and thus the circuit
 court did not have jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award.
 
In its appeal in CAAP-13-187, IUPAT argues that the
 
circuit court erred when it denied IUPAT's Motion for Final
 Judgment to include an award of attorneys' fees and costs. 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
For the reasons set forth below, we affirm, but remand
 
so that the circuit court may address IUPAT's claim for
 
attorneys' fees and costs.
II. Endo's Assertion of Preemption is Waived
 
As a threshold matter, we address Endo's argument that
 
federal law preempted application of HRS Chapter 658A. In its
 opening brief in CAAP-12-661, Endo briefly contends that the
 circuit court lacked jurisdiction to decide any issues pursuant
 to HRS Chapter 658A. In CAAP-12-1094, Endo expressly contends
 that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and Section 301 of the
 Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) apply such as to preempt
 state law and require that the FAA be applied in determining
 confirmation of the arbitration award. Endo admits that it never
 raised these arguments in the circuit court, but nevertheless
 maintains that its arguments affect whether the circuit court had
 jurisdiction in this matter. 
We conclude, however, that Endo's federal preemption
 
arguments as to both the FAA and LMRA have been waived due to
 Endo's failure to raise the issue below, and the jurisdiction of
 the circuit court has not been implicated.
4 See Johnson v.
 
Armored Transp. of Calif., Inc., 813 F.2d 1041, 1043 (9th Cir.
 1987) (holding that argument that a state law claim was preempted
 by LMRA § 301 was waived because it was not properly preserved in
 the district court); Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., 926 F.2d 29, 38-41
 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that because LMRA § 301 preemption
 concerns what law a decision maker must apply, not what forum
 must decide the issue, it is a waivable argument); Yates v.
 Doctors Assoc., Inc., 549 N.E.2d 1010, 1014 (Ill. App. 1990) ("No
 suggestion was made that the Federal Arbitration Act preempted
 the law of this State until defendants filed their brief on
 appeal. Because the doctrine of federal preemption was not
 invoked at the trial level, we believe that issue has been
 waived."); Henry v. Alcove Inv., Inc., 284 Cal. Rptr. 255, 259
 
4
 In the circuit court, Endo based its Motion to Vacate on state law
and did not raise a preemption argument. Endo also did not attempt to remove
the case to federal court.
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Cal Ct. App. 1991) (refusing to consider an FAA federal
 
preemption argument that was not raised in the trial court). 
Thus, Endo waived its preemption arguments.
III. Confirmation of the Arbitration Award and
 
Denial of the Motion to Vacate
 
We review "the circuit court's ruling on an arbitration 
award de novo," but we are also "mindful that the circuit court's review of arbitral awards must be extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential." Tatibouet v Ellsworth, 99 Hawai
'i 226, 
233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) (citations, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The interpretation of an arbitration 
statute is a question of law reviewable de novo. Id. at 232-33, 
54 P.3d at 403-04. 
A. IUPAT's Motion to Confirm
 
Endo argues that the circuit court erred in confirming
 
the arbitration award because issuance of the award violated both
 
the CBA requirements and HRS § 658A-19. The plain language of
 HRS § 658A-22 (Supp. 2014) unambiguously provides that where a
 party moves to confirm an arbitration award, the court must
 confirm the award "unless the award is modified or corrected
 pursuant to section 658A-20 or 658A-24 or is vacated pursuant to
 section 658A-23." (Emphasis added.) Here, Endo did not seek to
 modify or correct the arbitration award, and it did not file a
 timely motion to vacate. Thus, the circuit court properly
 confirmed the award pursuant to the plain language of HRS § 658A­22, and moreover, Endo's arguments on appeal are without merit.
 
First, Endo asserts that the arbitration award is
 
invalid and therefore ineligible for confirmation because the JIC
 was not composed of three Endo-appointed members and three IUPAT-
appointed members, and the award was not issued by a majority or
 quorum, as required by the CBA. The record clearly demonstrates
 otherwise. The minutes of the JIC hearing show that all six
 members of the JIC were present (three for Endo and three for
 IUPAT) and that there was a unanimous vote in favor of IUPAT. 
The arbitration award itself states "[t]his decision is supported
 by a unanimous vote of the [JIC]. It is final and binding upon
 the parties" 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Second, Endo contends that the JIC decision and award
 
was not properly signed and authenticated as required by HRS
 
§ 658A-19. HRS § 658A-19 requires that "[a]n arbitrator shall
 make a record of an award" and that "[t]he record shall be signed
 or otherwise authenticated by any arbitrator who concurs with the
 award." (Emphasis added.) Because a plain reading of this
 statute does not require all arbitrators to sign the award, and
 the award was supported by a unanimous vote, we find no merit in
 Endo's argument that the award was invalid because it was signed
 by only two arbitrators.
B. Endo's Untimely Motion to Vacate
 
Endo failed to file a timely motion to vacate the
 
arbitration award. Under HRS § 658A-23(b), Endo was required to
 file a motion to vacate within ninety days after receiving notice
 of the April 29, 2011 arbitration award. Thus, Endo was required
 to file the Motion to Vacate by July 28, 2011, but did not do so
 until May 17, 2012, the day of the hearing on IUPAT's Motion to
 Confirm.
 
Endo argues that its Motion to Vacate was timely
 
because HRS § 658A-23(b) provides that a movant who alleges the
 award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means may
 file the motion within ninety days "after the ground is known or
 by the exercise of reasonable care would have been known by the
 movant[,]" and that Endo became aware of alleged foul play only
 as of March 2012. The circuit court considered the timeliness of
 Endo's fraud claim, and specifically found that "Endo was put on
 notice of the alleged complaints as early as April 22, 2011, when
 the [JIC] sent Endo a copy of the grievance and a notice of
 hearing." The circuit court further found:
 
Yet, despite the accusations by its employees and the
decision of the JIC, Endo declined to investigate the
allegations or look into the matter itself. Only after the
motion to confirm was filed, over one year later, did Endo
begin to investigate the allegations in earnest and bring
accusations of foul play against the Union. The Court finds
 that Endo's lack of due diligence does not constitute "good
cause" to consider its motion to vacate prior to the hearing
on the Union's motion to confirm. Endo was clearly aware of
the complaints allegedly made its employees, yet declined to
investigate them until the last minute.
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Endo did not challenge these findings on appeal, and they are 
therefore binding on this court. See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. 
of Water Supply, 97 Hawai 'i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). 
Thus, it is apparent that if Endo had exercised reasonable care, it would have known about any grounds for its fraud claim soon after learning of the grievance. 
Because Endo's Motion to Vacate was untimely under HRS 
§ 658A-23, Endo did not preserve for judicial review its allegation that the arbitration award was procured by "corruption, fraud, or other undue means," which is one of the bases for vacating an arbitration award as set forth in HRS § 658A-23(a)(1). See Excelsior Lodge No. One v. Eyecor, Ltd., 74 
Haw. 210, 223-28, 847 P.2d 652, 658-60 (1992); Schmidt v. Pac. Benefit Servs., Inc., 113 Hawai
'i 161, 168, 150 P.3d 810, 817 
(2006). We need not address Endo's other arguments related to the denial of the Motion to Vacate. 
IV. IUPAT's Motion for Fees/Costs
 
As the circuit court subsequently recognized, it 
erroneously entered its November 19, 2012 order purporting to grant IUPAT's August 10, 2012 Motion for Fees/Costs because, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
4(a)(3), IUPAT's motion was deemed denied when the circuit court did not rule on the motion within ninety days. Thus, the November 19, 2012 order was a nullity in regard to awarding fees and costs. 
IUPAT invoked the tolling provision in HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3) when it timely filed its Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 54(d)(2)(B) Motion for Fees/Costs within fourteen days after entry of the July 30, 2012 Judgment. HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides: 
If any party files a timely motion . . . for attorney's fees
or costs, the time for filing the notice of appeal is
extended until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of
the motion; provided, that the failure to dispose of any
motion by order entered upon the record within 90 days after
the date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of
 the motion.
 
(Emphasis added.) As the Hawai 'i Supreme Court has explained, 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) "provides that the court has 90 days to dispose 
of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . , regardless of 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
when the notice of appeal is filed." Buscher v. Boning, 114 
Hawai'i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007). When "the court 
fail[s] to issue an order on [a post-judgment fees motion] ninety 
days after . . . [filing] the motion, the motion was deemed denied." Cnty. of Hawai
'i v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 
Hawai'i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008). Pursuant to HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(3), IUPAT's Motion for Fees/Costs was automatically deemed denied at the end of the day on November 8, 2012, the ninetieth calendar day after August 10, 2012. Thus, the circuit court's November 19, 2012 written order was a nullity for purposes of awarding fees and costs. Pacific Lightnet, Inc. v. 
Time Warner Telecom, Inc., Nos. 28948, 29105, 2013 WL 310149 at *17-18 (App. Jan. 25, 2013) (mem.), vacated in part on other grounds, 131 Hawai
'i 257, 319 P.3d 97 (2013).
V. IUPAT's Motion for Final Judgment
 
In denying IUPAT's December 20, 2012 Motion for Final
 
Judgment seeking to include an award of attorneys' fees and
 costs, the circuit court concluded that because the November 19,
 2012 written order was null and void, "a final judgment to
 include the specific amount of the attorneys' fees and costs
 granted by the November 19, 2012 Order, cannot be issued." We
 agree with the circuit court.
 
First, the July 30, 2012 Judgment was final despite 
leaving the attorneys' fees and costs unresolved.
5 It is well 
settled under Hawai 'i law that a subsequent order or judgment 
awarding fees and costs does not change the fact that a previous judgment was final. See HRCP Rule 58 ("The entry of the judgment 
shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs."); HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) (a motion for attorneys' fees "must be filed and 
5
 The July 30, 2012 Judgment provided in pertinent part:
 
This judgment is entered as to all claims raised by
the parties, and it resolves all claims by and against the
parties in the above-entitled case, except as to an
allowance of costs and attorneys' fees as set forth in
paragraph 5 of the Order Granting Motion to Confirm and to
Enforce Arbitration Decision and Award, Entry of Judgment,
Costs and Attorney's Fees filed on April 23, 2012 entered on
June 29, 2012. No other claims or parties remain.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
served no later than 14 days after entry of an appealable order 
or judgment"); CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., 95 Hawai 'i 301, 
307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) ("The entry of judgment and taxation of costs are separate legal acts.") (citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Second, neither the filing of Endo's appeal nor the
 
circuit court's October 22, 2012 minute order during the ninety
 day period rendered the deemed denied provision in HRAP Rule
 4(a)(3) inapplicable. There is nothing in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) that
 imposes such a limitation. In addition, the circuit court
 properly concluded that although a minute order had been issued,
 it was not an order entered upon the record and it therefore
 fails to satisfy HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). See HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) ("A
 
judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of
 the clerk of the court."); State v. English, 68 Haw. 46, 52, 705
 P.2d 12, 16 (1985) ("Though the substance of the court's decision
 is captured in the minutes of court proceedings kept by the clerk
 who attended the hearing, they do not substitute for the
 requisite written document; they are merely 'prepared for [the
 court's] own use.'").
 
In sum, because the November 19, 2012 order was a
 
nullity for purposes of awarding fees and costs, the circuit
 court was correct in denying IUPAT's Motion for Final Judgment as
 there was nothing to enter judgment upon.
 
Notwithstanding the above, and although IUPAT's 
previously filed Motion for Fees/Costs is deemed denied by operation of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), IUPAT is not without recourse in regard to its asserted right to attorneys' fees and costs. Rather, in light of prior Hawai
'i case law, we conclude it is 
appropriate to remand the case so that IUPAT may re-assert its claims for attorneys' fees and costs without prejudice from the deemed denial of its prior motion. See C & J Coupe, 119 Hawai
'i 
at 367-68, 198 P.3d at 630-31; Pacific Lightnet, 2013 WL 310149 at *18.

VI. Conclusion
 
Based on the above, we affirm the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit as to: (1) the June 29, 2012 Order Granting IUPAT's
 
Motion to Confirm and to Enforce Arbitration Decision and Award;
 (2) the July 10, 2012 Order Denying Endo's Motion to Vacate
 Arbitration Decision and Award; (3) the July 30, 2012 Judgment;
 and (4) the February 25, 2013 Order Denying IUPAT's Motion for a
 Final Judgment.
 
We remand the case to the circuit court to address 
IUPAT's claims for attorneys' fees and costs.
