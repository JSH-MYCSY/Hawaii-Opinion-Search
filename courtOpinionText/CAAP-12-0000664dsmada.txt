Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Consumer
 
Solutions REO LLC's (Appellee Consumer Solutions REO) October 1,
 
2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12­0000664 (Motion), (2) the lack of any memorandum by Defendants-
Appellants George Tagilima Annastas and Bertha Henerita Annastas
 (Appellants Annastas) in opposition to Appellee Consumer
 Solutions REO's October 1, 2012 Motion, and (3) the record, it
 appears that we lack jurisdiction over the Appellants Annastas’s
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal from the Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes's June 20, 2012 
post-judgment order denying the Appellants Annastas’s post-judgment motion to set aside the December 15, 2011 judgment for possession, under Rule 60(b) of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP), because the Appellants Annastas’s appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2011) authorizes appeals from district court final judgments, final orders or final decrees. 
Consequently, "[a] post-judgment 
order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). The June 20, 2012 post-judgment order denying the Appellants Annastas’s DCRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to set aside the December 15, 2011 judgment for possession is an appealable final post-judgment order under HRS § 641-1(a). Nevertheless, "[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The Appellants Annastas did not file their July 25, 2012 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the June 20, 2012 post-judgment order denying the Appellants Annastas’s DCRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to set aside the December 15, 2011 judgment for possession, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required. Therefore, the Appellants Annastas's July 25, 2012 notice of appeal is not timely. 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
 reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
 default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
 except the failure to give timely notice of appeal.") Absent a
 timely appeal, we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Consumer Solutions
 
REO's October 1, 2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 number CAAP-12-0000664 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000664 is dismissed.
