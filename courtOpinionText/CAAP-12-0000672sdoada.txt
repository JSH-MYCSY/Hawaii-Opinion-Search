JAN MOXLEY, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 05-1-0244)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Fujise, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals 
from the "Findings of Fact and, Conclusions of Law and Order Re: 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Indictment for Destruction of Evidence" (Dismissal Order). 
The case against Defendant-Appellee Jan Moxley (Moxley)
 
had been set for retrial after this court vacated his Judgment of
 Conviction and Probation Sentence due to prosecutorial
 misconduct. Prior to the retrial, Moxley moved to dismiss the
 charges against him based on the State's loss or destruction of
 original photographs taken by the police during the
 investigation. The Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit
 
1
 Court) granted Moxley's motion, ruling that the loss of the
original photographs was "so critical" that it would render the

retrial "fundamentally unfair." The Circuit Court filed its
 
Dismissal Order on June 29, 2012.
 
On appeal, the State argues that the Circuit Court
 
abused its discretion in granting Moxley's motion to dismiss. We
 affirm.
 
The State had no explanation for why the original 
photographs were lost or destroyed. The case was essentially a credibility contest between Moxley and the CW, who had conflicting versions of the incident. Having presided over the first trial, the Circuit Court was intimately familiar with the case, the nature of the prosecution and defense evidence, and the impact that the loss of evidence would have. We cannot say that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in granting Moxley's motion to dismiss. See State v. Wong, 97 Hawai
'i 512, 517, 40 
P.3d 914, 919 (2002) ("An appellate court reviews a trial court's decision to dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion."). 
We affirm the Circuit Court's Dismissal Order. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, November 18, 2015.
