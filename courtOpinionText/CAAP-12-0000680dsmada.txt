IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAPONO TUMALE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT,
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(2DTI-12-017490 and 2DTC-12-005109)
 
ORDER
 
(1)
 DISMISSING THE AUGUST 14, 2012
MOTION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
 
AND
 
(2) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Gonoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant Kapono
 
Tumale's (Appellant Tumale) August 14, 2012 motion to proceed in
 
forma pauperis, the papers in support, and the record and files
 herein, it appears that the motion must be dismissed because we
 lack jurisdiction over this appeal under Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) and HRS § 641-12 (Supp.
 2011).
 
Appellant Tumale appears to be appealing from district
 
court cases in 2DTI-12-017490 and 2DTC-12-005109 involving a mix
 of non-criminal traffic infractions and also alleged crimes. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Appeals from the district court, in criminal cases, are 
authorized by HRS § 641-12, which . . . provides in pertinent part that appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 
391 (1996) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). "[I]n order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 228, 236, 74 
P.3d 980, 988 (2003). 
“No traffic infraction shall be classified as a 
criminal offense.” HRS § 291D-3(a). Appeals from judgments after trial for a traffic infraction are taken in the manner provided for appeals from district court civil judgments. Hawai'i Civil Traffic Rules, Rule 19(d). In order to appeal from 
a civil matter in the district court pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment, order or decree: 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals
are allowed in civil matters from all final
 
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and
district courts. In district court cases, a
judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order,
or decree ends the litigation by fully deciding
all rights and liabilities of all parties,
leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted; emphases added). Thus, "[i]n civil cases before the 
district court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai' i 
73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005) (citation, original brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Both Rule 4(a)(2) and Rule 4(b)(4) of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) contain substantially similar language that authorizes a party to file a premature notice of appeal in a civil or criminal matter after the announcement of a trial court's decision but before the trial court's entry of the judgment or order. When the Supreme Court of Hawai' i analyzed 
substantially similar language in an earlier version of HRAP Rule 4(b), the Supreme Court of Hawai' i held that "[w]hile we 
treat an appeal as timely where a defendant has filed his or her notice of appeal after the court has announced an oral decision but before the entry of a written order or judgment, see HRAP [Rule] 4(b), we cannot do so where the court has rendered no decision whatsoever." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai' i 10, 14, 
897 P.2d 937, 941 (1995) ("Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to address the merits of Grattafiori's appeal."). 
Likewise in the instant case, Appellant Tumale filed
 
his July 31, 2012 notice of appeal prior to the district court's
 announcement of its final decisions in 2DTI-12-017490 and 2DTC­12-005109. Absent a final decision and the entry of a written
 judgment, order or decree, we lack jurisdiction over appellate
 court case number CAAP-12-00000680.

[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any
court considering and resolving an appeal or
original action. Appellate courts, upon
determining that they lack jurisdiction shall
not require anything other than a dismissal of
the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case
further. Thus, appellate courts have an
obligation to insure that they have jurisdiction
to hear and determine each case. The lack of
 subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived
by any party at any time. Accordingly, when we
perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal,
we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal.
 
Housing Fin. and Dev. Corp. v. Castle, 79 Hawai' i 64, 76, 898 
P.2d 576, 588 (1995) (citation, internal quotation marks, and
 
ellipsis points omitted; emphasis added); Peterson v. Hawaii
 Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 Hawai' i 322, 326, 944 P.2d 1265, 
1269 (1997), superseded on other grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp.
 1999); Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 
64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Tumale's August 14,
 
2012 motion to proceed in forma pauperis is dismissed, because we
 hereby dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000680 for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction.
