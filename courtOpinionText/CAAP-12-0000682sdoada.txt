v.
 
LINN M. KIYUNA, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAI'ANAE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-05236)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Linn M. Kiyuna (Kiyuna) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, filed on July 6, 2012, in the District Court of
 the First Circuit, Wai
'anae Division (district court).1 Kiyuna 
was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(4) (Supp. 2014).

 HRS § 291E-61 provides in pertinent part:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
(continued...)

On appeal, Kiyuna contends:
 
(1) the district court erred by allowing the original
 
complaint to be amended to include the requisite mens rea for the
 
alleged violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1); and
 
(2) the district court erred by denying his motion to
 
suppress the results of his blood test because (a) he was misled
 and/or inadequately advised of his rights, thus he did not
 knowingly and voluntarily consent to the blood test in violation
 of his due process rights, (b) he should have been advised of his
 rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), prior to
 being asked whether he would take a breath or blood alcohol test,
 and (c) he was deprived of an attorney and specifically advised
 that he had no right to an attorney, in violation of HRS § 803-9
 (2014).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kiyuna's points of error as follows and affirm.
 
The parties stipulated to the evidence in this case.
 
Based on that evidence, Kiyuna's vehicle was involved in a motor
 vehicle collision at about 8:23 p.m. on November 20, 2011. The
 officer at the scene detected a strong alcohol type odor emitting
 from Kiyuna's breath. Kiyuna agreed to take a field sobriety
 test, which he failed. He was arrested at about 9:25 p.m. and
 transported to the Kapolei police station around 10:15 p.m. At
 the police station, Kiyuna was provided a copy of a form entitled
 "Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent for
 Testing" (Implied Consent Form), which was read to him at about
 10:30 p.m. Kiyuna initialed the portion of the form that stated
 
2(...continued)
. . . [or] 

(4)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of
 blood.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
he "[a]greed to take a breath test and refused the blood test[,]"
 
and signed and dated the form. Kiyuna was given two
 opportunities to provide a sample on the intoxilizer machine, but
 both attempts were not valid allegedly due to Kiyuna blocking the
 air passage with his tongue. Kiyuna then stated that he wanted
 to do a blood draw. Kiyuna was read a form entitled "Sanctions
 for Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle & Implied
 Consent for Testing" and checked that he "[a]greed to take a
 blood test and refused the breath test" at 11:15 p.m.
3 He was
 
transported to the Pearl City police station, where the blood
 draw was administered. The blood test showed that Kiyuna had a
 blood level of .10 grams ethanol per 100cc of whole blood.
 
(1) Kiyuna contends that the district court erred by 
allowing the State to amend the complaint to allege the requisite mens rea for the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge, in order to comply with the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's ruling in State v. Nesmith, 127 
Hawai'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). 
In State v. Kam, 134 Hawai 'i 280, 339 P.3d 1081 (App. 
2014), cert. granted, SCWC-12-0000897 (Apr. 2, 2015), this court addressed the same arguments Kiyuna raises here and held that 
the District Court had the discretion to permit the State to
amend the charges in the complaint before trial "if
substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced."
Here, Kam does not claim that her substantial rights were
prejudiced by the State's amendment of the OVLPSR–OVUII
charge and the HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII
charge before trial to allege the required mens rea.

 The Sanctions & Implied Consent Form informed Kiyuna, among other
things, that:
 
13. __ If you refuse to be tested, criminal charges may be
filed against you under part IV, Prohibited Conduct, section
291E or if applicable, you may be subject to the sanctions
of section 291E-65.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Id. at 286, 339 P.3d at 1087.4 As in Kam, Kiyuna does not argue
 
that his substantial rights were prejudiced by the amended
 
charge. Therefore, his first point of error is without merit.
 
Moreover, Kiyuna was also convicted under the HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(4) charge, which could have proceeded regardless of the amended complaint because it is a strict liability offense that does not require the allegation of a mens rea. See Nesmith, 
127 Hawai
'i at 58-61, 276 P.3d at 627-30. In Nesmith, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court held that HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) was a strict liability offense that can serve as a separate basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61. Id. at 61, 276 P.3d at 630. The 
court noted that "driving under the influence of alcohol, as measured by blood alcohol content, [is] a per se offense[.]" Id. 
at 59, 276 P.3d at 628. The court cited previous case law which provided that Driving Under the Influence was a per se offense under HRS § 291-4(a)(2) (1985), the predecessor statute to HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) and (4). Id. at 58, 276 P.3d at 627. The 
Nesmith court held that because the current HRS § 291E-61(a) is nearly identical to its predecessor, "the line of cases holding HRS § 291-4(a)(2) to be an absolute liability offense continues to apply with the same force . . . ." Id. at 60, 276 P.3d at 
629. The court ruled that although the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) 
charge was insufficient for failing to allege a mens rea, the (a)(3) charge was sufficient to affirm the defendants' convictions. Id. at 61, 276 P.3d at 630. It follows that HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(4) is similarly a strict liability offense and the Nesmith analysis applies. See Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i at 62 n.2, 
276 P.3d at 631 n.2 (Acoba, J. concurring and dissenting) (noting that although (a)(4) was not charged in that case, "the analysis 
4
 This court based its decision on Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 7(f)(1), which provides: 
(f) Amendment.
 
(1) The court may permit a charge other than an indictment
to be amended at any time before trial commences if
substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
set forth [by the majority opinion] would likewise apply to that
 
provision"). Accordingly, subsections (a)(1) and/or (a)(4) could
 serve as the basis for Kiyuna's conviction in this case.
 
Therefore, Kiyuna's first point of error is without
 
merit.
 
(2) As to Kiyuna's contention that the district court 
erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of his blood test, the issues raised by Kiyuna were considered and rejected by this court in State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 
2014), cert. granted, SCWC-12-0000858 (June 24, 2014). Based on the decision in Won, the district court did not err in denying Kiyuna's motion to suppress the results of his blood test. 
Given that the results of Kiyuna's blood test
 
established that he had a blood alcohol content of 0.10, he was
 properly convicted under HRS § 291E-61(a)(4).
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on July 6, 2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wai
'anae Division, is 
affirmed.
