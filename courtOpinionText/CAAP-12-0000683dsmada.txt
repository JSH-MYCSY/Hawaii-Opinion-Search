dates for Claimant-Appellant Kyle B. Aguiar (Appellant), pro se,
 to file a statement of jurisdiction and opening brief,
 
respectively, to December 6 and 13, 2012;
 
(2) Appellant did not file either document;
 (3) On January 10, 2013, the appellate clerk issued a 
notice of default, informing Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and,

include dismissal;
 
(4) On January 28, 2013, the appellate clerk issued an

filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had
 
expired and, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30, the matter would be called

default based upon unfamiliarity with court procedures;

relief from default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening
 
brief, and extended the respective due dates to February 25 and
 
28, 2013. The court cautioned Appellant that no further
 
extensions would be granted absent extraordinary circumstances,
 
and failure to comply with the order may result in dismissal of
 
the appeal; and

jurisdiction on February 26, 2013, but he has not filed an
 
opening brief, or motion for extension or other relief.
