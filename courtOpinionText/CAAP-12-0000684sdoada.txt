OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RICK J. FISHER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAI'ANAE DIVISION
 
(Case No. 1DTA-11-04714)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Rick J. Fisher (Fisher) appeals
 
from the Judgment entered on July 20, 2012, in the District Court
 
of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Fisher was convicted of
 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII),
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3)
 (Supp. 2013).
2 We affirm.
 
On appeal, Fisher argues that the District Court erred
 
1	 The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.

 HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
. . . .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

in: (1) denying his motion to suppress the results of the breath
 
test because he was asked while in custody whether he wanted to
 incriminate himself in the petty misdemeanor offense of refusing
 to take an alcohol test without being read his Miranda rights;
 (2) denying his motion to suppress the results of the breath test
 because he was misinformed of his statutory right to an attorney;
 (3) denying his motion to suppress the results of the breath test when the police informed him that he "shall" be subject to 30 days in jail for refusing; and (4) allowing the State of Hawai
'i 
(the State) to amend the complaint. 
With regard to Fisher's first three points, we recently 
rejected the same arguments in State v. Won, --- Hawai 'i ---, --­
P.3d ---, No. CAAP-12-0000858, 2014 WL 1270615 at *1 (App. Mar. 28, 2014). Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Fisher's motion to suppress. 
Fisher also argues that it was error for the District 
Court to allow the State to amend its complaint to comply with State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), that 
required that a state of mind be included in the charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Fisher argued in support of his motion that "the case must either be dismissed without prejudice, or the State must proceed on the [HRS § 291E-61](a)(3) charge alone." However, "HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) remains an absolute liability offense[,]" Nesmith at 60, 276 P.3d at 629, and Fisher was found to be in violation of both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). The Court in Nesmith also affirmed Nesmith's conviction for OVUII, holding that "HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) is an absolute liability offense for which no mens rea need be alleged or proven." Nesmith at 61, 276 P.3d at 630. Therefore, we need not decide whether the District Court erred in allowing amendment of the charge in this case, because the original charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) was sufficient as originally charged and Fisher was found guilty of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).
