appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, filed on July 20, 2012, in the District Court of
 the First Circuit, Wai
'anae Division (district court).1 Tuia was 
convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provide:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty;

On appeal, Tuia contends:
 
(1) the district court erred by allowing the original
 
complaint to be amended to include the requisite mens rea for the
 alleged violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1); and
 
(2) the district court erred by denying his motion to
 
suppress the results of his breath test because (a) he was
 mislead and/or inadequately advised of his rights, thus he did
 not knowingly and voluntarily consent to the breath test in
 violation of his Due Process rights, (b) he should have been
 
advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436
 
(1966), prior to being asked whether he would take a breath or
 blood alcohol test, and (c) he was deprived of an attorney and
 specifically advised that he had no right to an attorney, in
 violation of HRS § 803-9 (1993). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tuia's points of error as follows and affirm.
 
The parties stipulated to the evidence in this case. 
Based on that evidence, Tuia's vehicle was stopped in the early
 morning hours of March 9, 2012, after a police officer observed
 the vehicle being operated erratically and also weaving over lane
 markings on the H-1 freeway. Officers at the scene observed that
 they could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from
 Tuia and that his eyes were red. Tuia agreed to take a field
 sobriety test, which he failed. He was arrested and transported
 to the Kapolei police station. At the police station, Tuia was
 provided a copy of a form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While
 Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent
 Form), which was read to him. Tuia consented to a breath test,

which showed that he had a breath alcohol concentration of 0.159
 
grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
 
(1) Tuia contends that the district court erred by 
allowing the State to amend the complaint to allege the requisite mens rea for the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge, in order to comply with the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's ruling in State v. Nesmith, 127 
Hawai'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). However, the HRS § 291E­
61(a)(3) charge could have proceeded regardless of the amended complaint because it is a strict liability offense that does not require the allegation of a mens rea. Id. at 58-61, 276 P.3d at 
627-30. "Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61." Id. at 61, 276 P.3d 
at 630. In Nesmith, like this case, the defendants were charged under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3). Id. at 50-51, 276 P.3d 
at 619-20. Although the supreme court ruled that the HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) charge was insufficient for failing to allege a mens rea, the court deemed the (a)(3) charge sufficient and affirmed the defendants' convictions under subsection (a)(3). Id. at 61, 
276 P.3d at 630. 
Therefore, we need not determine whether the district
 
court erred in allowing the complaint to be amended. The
 original charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) was sufficient and Tuia
 was convicted under that provision as well.
 
(2) As to Tuia's contention that the district court 
erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of his breath test, the issues raised by Tuia were recently considered and rejected by this court in State v. Won, --- Hawai
'i ---, --- P.3d 
---, CAAP-12-0000858, 2014 WL 1270615 (App. Mar. 28, 2014, amended May 2, 2014). Based on the decision in Won, the district court did not err in denying Tuia's motion to suppress the results of his breath test. 
Given that the results of Tuia's breath test
 
established that he had a blood alcohol content of 0.159, he was
 properly convicted under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).

Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on July 20, 2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wai
'anae Division, is 
affirmed to the extent that Tuia was convicted under HRS § 291E­61(a)(3).
