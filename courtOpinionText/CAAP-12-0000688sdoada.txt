Defendants-Appellants Dana Y.K. Shim Palama and 
Roland K. Palama, Jr. (collectively, the "Palamas"), appearing

 Palamas'] Motion for Relief from [the Circuit Court's] April 19,

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court)1
 
on July 6, 2012. We affirm.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as
 
Trustee for the Structured Asset Investment Loan Trust, 2006-4
 
(U.S. Bank), filed a complaint for foreclosure on April 13, 2009.
 
U.S. Bank moved for summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure. 
On September 20, 2010, the Circuit Court granted U.S. Bank's motion and entered summary judgment, a decree of foreclosure, and an order of sale in favor of U.S. Bank as a final judgment pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) 
(2000). The Circuit Court appointed a commissioner and the property was sold at auction. On April 19, 2011, the Circuit Court entered a judgment, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b) and Rule 58 (2010), confirming the sale and for a writ of possession. The Palamas did not appeal from the judgments entered on the decree of foreclosure or the order confirming sale. 
On April 19, 2012, one year after the entry of judgment
 
confirming the sale and for writ of possession, the Palamas filed
 their post-judgment motion seeking relief from the entry of that
 judgment. The Circuit Court denied the Palamas' post-judgment
 motion and filed its Order Denying the Palamas' Motion for Post-
Judgment Relief.
 
The sole argument raised by the Palamas on appeal is 
that the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their case because they have demonstrated the continuing existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Our appellate courts, however, have repeatedly held that claims of this nature are without merit. In State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai' i 479, 291 P.3d 377 
(2013), the Hawai' i Supreme Court reaffirmed this view where it 
stated: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from
the court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of
the Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm
that "[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness"
