IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
IN THE INTEREST OF SP
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 10-00102)
 
ORDER GRANTING OCTOBER 23, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) Petitioner-Appellee
 
Department of Human Services' (Appellee Department of Human
 
Services) October 23, 2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 
number CAAP-12-0000696 for lack of jurisdiction, (2) Mother­
Appellant's October 27, 2012 memorandum in response to Appellee
 
Department of Human Services' October 23, 2012 motion in which
 
Mother-Appellant's counsel states that Mother-Appellant is in
 
agreement with dismissing her appeal, and (3) the record, it
 
appears that we lack jurisdiction over Mother-Appellant's appeal
 
from the Honorable Matthew J. Viola's July 20, 2012 "Decision
 
Regarding Trial on Motion to Terminate Parental Rights" (the July
 
20, 2012 order), because the July 20, 2012 order is not an
 
appealable final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571­
54 (2006).
 
Under HRS § 571-54, "appeals in family court cases, as
 
in other civil cases, may be taken only from (1) a final
 
judgment, order, or decree, . . . or (2) a certified
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interlocutory order." In re Doe, 96 Hawaif i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 
878, 889 (2001) (citations omitted). "Final order means an order 
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be 
accomplished." Familian Northwest v. Central Pacific Boiler, 68 
Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "However, it is widely acknowledged 
that a final judgment or decree is not necessarily the last 
decision of a case. What determines the finality of an order or 
decree is the nature and effect of the order or decree." In re 
Jane Doe, 77 Hawaif i 109, 114, 883 P.2d 30, 35 (1994) (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted). "The very nature of a 
family court chapter 587 proceeding entails an ongoing case which 
does not result in a final order, as that term is generally 
defined, . . . because, under chapter 587, the family court 
retains continuing jurisdiction over the case in order to prevent 
future harm or threatened harm to a child." In re Doe, 96 
Hawaifi 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citations, internal 
quotation marks, and original brackets omitted). Despite the 
family court's continuing jurisdiction over a minor child, 
"[i]mmediate review is necessary because parents have fundamental 
liberty interests in the care, custody, and management of the[ir] 
child[ren]." In re Jane Doe, 77 Hawaif i at 115, 883 P.2d at 36 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and original brackets omitted). Thus, a family court order that infringes upon 
parental custody rights is an appealable decision even though the 
requisite finality normally required for appeals is lacking. Id. 
at 114, 883 P.2d at 35 (citations omitted). 
The July 20, 2012 order did not end the proceedings for 
Appellee Department of Human Services' motion to terminate parental rights. According to the language within the July 20, 
2012 order, the proceedings are ongoing and have not yet 
concluded. Therefore, the July 20, 2012 order is not an 
appealable final order pursuant to HRS § 571-54. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Department of Human Services' 
October 23, 2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case number 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
CAAP-12-0000696 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and
 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000696 is dismissed for lack
 
of jurisdiction.
