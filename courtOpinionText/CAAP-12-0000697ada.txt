OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Plaintiff/Appellant Karen Ryan (Plaintiff) appeals from
 
a July 17, 2012 final judgment entered in the Circuit Court of
 
1
the Second Circuit  (circuit court) dismissing Plaintiff's
complaint and entering judgment in favor of Defendants/Cross-
Claim Defendants/Appellees Terrence D. Palmer, Mary Lynne Boland,
 
and Kahana Manor AOAO; and Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/
 
Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellees Alpha Executive Security, Inc.
 
and Lowson and Associates (collectively, Defendants).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal arises out of a tort lawsuit Plaintiff
 
filed for injuries she allegedly suffered while in her apartment
 
unit. 
On December 29, 2010, Plaintiff filed a complaint
 
asserting various tort claims against Defendants, and the parties
 engaged in discovery between March and August 2011. On July 29,
 
2011, Plaintiff filed a request to admit the case into the Court
 
Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP). The circuit court granted
 
the request on August 30, 2011.
 
On September 20, 2011, the circuit court entered an 
"Order Of Dismissal" dismissing Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to 
Rule 12(q) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of 
Hawai'i (RCCH). RCCH Rule 12(q) states: 
(q) Dismissal for Want of Prosecution.  An action may
be dismissed sua sponte with written notice to the parties
if a pretrial statement has not been filed within 8 months
after a complaint has been filed[.] . . . Such dismissal may
be set aside and the action reinstated by order of the court
for good cause shown upon motion duly filed not later than
ten (10) days from the date of the order of dismissal.
 
At the time the circuit court entered its dismissal order, eight
 
months and twenty-two days had passed since the complaint's
 
filing, and Plaintiff had not submitted a pretrial statement.

 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On September 30, 2011, Plaintiff's attorney Joseph T.
 
Toma (Toma) filed a "Motion To Set Aside Order Of Dismissal" and
 
a supporting declaration by Toma. Toma stated he had "just
 
overlooked" the pretrial statement and noted the case had been
 
admitted into the CAAP, and he requested additional time to file
 
a pretrial statement. The circuit court orally denied
 
Plaintiff's motion at a hearing on October 27, 2011.
 
The circuit court entered its "Order Denying 
Plaintiff's Motion To Set Aside Order of Dismissal, Filed 
09/30/11" on November 4, 2011, and Plaintiff filed a motion for 
reconsideration on November 14, 2011. The motion included a 
declaration by Toma's co-counsel, Thomas Kolbe, stating he had 
been in the process of closing his private law practice and had 
miscommunicated with Toma regarding the pretrial statement. The 
circuit court held a hearing on December 6, 2011, concluding in 
its oral denial of Plaintiff's motion. The circuit court entered 
its order denying the motion for reconsideration on December 22, 
2011 and its final judgment dismissing Plaintiff's complaint on 
July 17, 2012. The parties assume, and we agree, that the 
circuit court's dismissal was with prejudice. See Hawai' i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 41(b)(3).2 
2
HRCP Rule 41(b) states, in pertinent part:
 
(b) Involuntary dismissal: Effect thereof.
. . . .
 (2) For failure to prosecute or to comply with these rules
or any order of the court, the court may sua sponte dismiss
an action or any claim with written notice to the parties.
Such dismissal may be set aside and the action or claim
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon
motion duly filed not later than 10 days from the date of
the order of dismissal.
 (3) Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise
specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any
dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or
for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an
adjudication upon the merits.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Plaintiff contends the circuit court abused
 
its discretion when it denied Plaintiff's "Motion To Set Aside
 
Order Of Dismissal" and her motion for reconsideration.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 "[W]here a court sua sponte issues an order of
 
dismissal for want of prosecution, its action is reviewable on
 
appeal for abuse of discretion." Compass Dev., Inc. v. Blevins,
 
10 Haw. App. 388, 397-98, 876 P.2d 1335, 1340 (1994).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Preliminarily, the parties disagree as to whether case 
law regarding dismissals under HRCP Rule 41(b)(2) applies to the circuit court's dismissal based on RCCH Rule 12(q). In 
interpreting the circuit court's authority under HRCP Rule 
41(b)(2), our courts have cautioned that a dismissal with 
prejudice is a "severe sanction" of "last resort" that cannot be 
affirmed "absent deliberate delay, contumacious conduct, or 
actual prejudice." In re Blaisdell, 125 Hawai' i 44, 49, 252 P.3d 
63, 68 (2011); see also Shasteen, Inc. v. Hilton Hawaiian Village Joint Venture, 79 Hawai' i 103, 107, 899 P.2d 386, 390 (1995). 
Defendants contend authorities regarding HRCP Rule 41(b) are inapplicable because RCCH 12(q) is a separate and distinct rule 
permitting dismissal. We disagree. 
RCCH Rule 12(q)'s language is patterned after HRCP Rule
 
41(b)(2). Both rules provide that a court may dismiss an action
 
sua sponte for failure to prosecute, and the rules contain
 
substantially identical language regarding the manner of seeking
 
relief from each section. See HRCP Rule 41(b)(2); RCCH Rule
 
12(q) ("Such dismissal may be set aside and the action reinstated
 by order of the court for good cause shown upon motion duly filed
 
not later than ten [(10)] days from the date of the order of
 
4
     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3
dismissal."). RCCH Rule 32  further provides that the RCCH rules
cannot conflict with the HRCP rules and that the latter prevails
 
to the extent there is any conflict. Defendants' interpretation
 
of RCCH Rule 12(q) as authorizing a circuit court to 
sua sponte
 
dismiss an action with prejudice even "absent deliberate delay,
 contumacious conduct, or actual prejudice" puts the rule in
 
conflict with the HRCP by expanding the circuit court's authority
 
beyond that which it possesses under HRCP Rule 41(b).
 
Defendants rely primarily on Lim v. Harvis Const.,
 
Inc., 65 Haw. 71, 647 P.2d 290 (1982) in support of their
 
argument that HRCP Rule 41(b) and RCCH Rule 12(q) are distinct
 
rules. At the time Lim was decided, the predecessor rule to the
 
current RCCH Rule 12(q) specified that the circuit court could
 
dismiss a case if there was a default in filing a statement of
 
readiness. See Rule 12(f) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts
 
(RCC).
4 Because the plaintiff in Lim had filed a timely
 
statement of readiness, the supreme court concluded RCC Rule
 
12(f) did not apply, and the dismissal must have been made
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b). Lim, 65 Haw. at 72-73, 647 P.2d at
 
291-92. The court accordingly focused its analysis solely on
 
3
 RCCH Rule 32 states: "To the extent that there is any conflict 
between these rules and the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure or the Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure the latter shall prevail." 
4
 In the time period relevant in Lim, RCC Rule 12(f) stated: 
(f) Where no statement of readiness has been filed
within one year after a complaint has been filed or within
any extension granted by the court, the clerk shall notify
in writing all parties affected thereby that the case will
be dismissed for want of prosecution unless objections are
filed within 10 days after receipt of such notice. If
objections are not filed within said 10–day period or any
extension granted by the court, the case shall stand
dismissed with prejudice without the necessity of an order
of dismissal being entered therein. Where objections are
filed within said 10–day period or any extension granted by
the court, the court shall hear said objections upon notice
and determine whether the case should be dismissed.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whether the dismissal was appropriate under HRCP Rule 41(b). 
Therefore, Lim's reference to GLA, Inc. v. Spengler, 1 Haw. App.
 
647, 623 P.2d 1283 (1981) and its treatment of dismissals under
 
RCC Rule 12(f) was dicta and is not controlling.
 
More directly on point is the supreme court's decision
 
in Bagalay v. Lahaina Restoration Found., 60 Haw. 125, 132-33,
 
588 P.2d 416, 421-22 (1978), which the court in Lim also cited. 
Unlike in Lim, in Bagalay the plaintiff's case was specifically
 
dismissed under RCC Rule 12(f) for failure to file a timely
 
statement of readiness. In analyzing the propriety of this
 
dismissal, the supreme court applied case law on dismissals
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b). Id. at 131-33, 588 P.2d at 421-22. 
Given that RCCH Rule 12(q)'s language and substance more closely
 mirrors HRCP Rule 41(b) than RCC Rule 12(f) did, Bagalay's
 
application of the HRCP Rule 41(b) standards to dismissals under
 
RCC Rule 12(f) is particularly persuasive. We conclude Bagalay
 
controls our analysis here. 
Applying the factors taken into consideration when
 
determining the propriety of a dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(b),
 
Plaintiff contends the circuit court's dismissal with prejudice
 
under these circumstances was an abuse of discretion. We agree.
 
Whether a trial court exercised sound discretion in
 
dismissing a case with prejudice turns on the facts of each case. 
Bagalay, 60 Haw. at 134, 588 P.2d at 422. Here, Plaintiff filed
 
her complaint on December 29, 2010, and Defendants filed their
 
answers in February 2011. The record shows that from March 2011
 
through August 2011, the parties actively engaged in discovery,
 
taking depositions and sending subpoenas, interrogatories, and
 
requests for admission. Pursuant to Plaintiff's request, the
 
case was then admitted into the CAAP on August 30, 2011.

 Defendants correctly assert that Plaintiff was obligated to follow
the RCCH Rules even though the case was placed into the CAAP. Hawai' i 
Arbitration Rules Rule 7 provides in relevant part: 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff was not dilatory in any respect other than her failure 
to file a pretrial statement. In summary, the record does not 
show a deliberate attempt to delay or actions rising to the level 
of contumacious conduct, and the circuit court did not make any 
such finding. See Blaisdell, 125 Hawai' i at 49-51, 252 P.3d at 
68-70; Shasteen, 79 Hawai' i at 390-92, 899 P.2d at 107-09. 
Moreover, the dismissal cannot be upheld due to actual 
prejudice to Defendants. Blaisdell, 125 Hawai' i at 50, 252 P.3d 
at 69. Nothing in the record shows prejudice. Defendants did 
not claim actual prejudice at any point, and they did not refute 
Plaintiff's argument that they suffered no prejudice from the 
delay. 
"[A]bsent a clear record of delay or contumacious 
conduct, the careful exercise of judicial discretion requires 
that a trial court consider less severe sanctions and explain, 
where not obvious, their inadequacy for promoting the interests 
of justice." Id. at 49, 252 P.3d at 68 (internal quotation marks 
and brackets omitted). The circuit court did not provide any explanation here. "The power of the court to prevent undue 
delays and to achieve the orderly disposition of cases must be 
weighed against the policy of law which favors dispositions of 
litigation on its merits." Shasteen, 79 Hawai' i at 107, 899 P.2d 
at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on the record, we conclude the circuit court abused its discretion in imposing 
dismissal with prejudice solely for Plaintiff's failure to file a 
Rule 7. RELATIONSHIP TO CIRCUIT COURT JURISDICTION AND
 
RULES; FORM OF DOCUMENTS.
 . . . .
 (E) Circuit Court Rule 12(q), and all rules of court or of
civil procedure requiring the filing of pleadings, remain in
effect notwithstanding the fact that a case is under the
[CAAP].
 
Therefore, the case's placement in the CAAP is relevant only to the extent it
indicates an absence of deliberate delay or contumacious conduct by Plaintiff.

timely pretrial statement and without any consideration on the
 
record of less severe sanctions. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We vacate the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's
