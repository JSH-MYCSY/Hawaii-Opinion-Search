Boland and Kahana Manor AOAO's Motion for Reconsideration" filed
 
August 30, 2013, the memorandum/papers in support of the motion,
 and the records and files in this case,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is granted in part
 
and denied in part and the Opinion of the Court filed August 20,

 The last sentence on page 3 is amended to read
 
"Because the circuit court's order of dismissal did not specify
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
otherwise, the circuit court's dismissal was with prejudice. See
 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 41(b)(3)." 
(2) Footnote 2 on page 3 is amended with emphases added
 
to read:
 
HRCP Rule 41(b) states, in pertinent part:
 (b) Involuntary dismissal: Effect thereof.
. . . .
 (2) For failure to prosecute or to comply with these rules
or any order of the court, the court may sua sponte dismiss
an action or any claim with written notice to the parties.
Such dismissal may be set aside and the action or claim
reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon
motion duly filed not later than 10 days from the date of
the order of dismissal.
 (3) Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise
specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any
dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or
for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an
adjudication upon the merits.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, September 12, 2013.
