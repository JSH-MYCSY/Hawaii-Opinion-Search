IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ALEXANDER F. SIMEONA, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
TANI DYDASCO, Defendant-Appellee,
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-10, Defendants.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-2565-10 GWBC)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Alexander F. Simeona (Simeona) 
sued Defendant-Appellee Tani Dydasco (Dydasco), an employee of 
the Office of Offender Management, Department of Public Safety, State of Hawai
'i, in her individual and official capacities. 
Simeona alleged that Dydasco was responsible for calculating his maximum term release date and that due to Dydasco's actions and omissions, he was "overdetained" or kept in prison beyond his proper release date. 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)
1
 
granted Dydasco's motion for summary judgment on the claims

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
raised by Simeona in his complaint, and it entered its "Judgment
 
for Defendant Tani Dydasco" (Judgment) on July 26, 2012. 
On appeal, Simeona contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred in granting Dydasco's motion for summary judgment as to
 Simeona's (1) federal Fourteenth Amendment due process claim, (2)
 federal Eighth Amendment claim for cruel and unusual punishment,
 (3) negligence claim, and (4) punitive damage claim. All of
 Simeona's claims against Dydasco are premised on his contention
 that he had been overdetained as the result of Dydasco's
 miscalculation of his maximum term release date. As explained
 below, because the undisputed evidence and applicable law
 establish that Dydasco did not err in calculating Simeona's
 maximum term release date, the Circuit Court properly granted
 summary judgment in favor of Dydasco. We affirm the Circuit
 Court's Judgment. 
I.
 
Based on undisputed evidence, the facts relevant to
 
this appeal are as follows: 
Simeona was convicted of offenses in five different
 
cases. He was sentenced in these cases on two different dates. 
First, on April 26, 1999, Simeona was sentenced in Cr. No. 98­1854 to five years in prison for unauthorized control of a
 propelled vehicle (UCPV). Second, on October 20, 1999, he was
 sentenced in:
 
(1) Cr. No. 99-0007 to five years in prison for UCPV;
 
(2) Cr. No. 98-0304 to five years in prison for
burglary; 
(3) Cr. No. 97-2290 to ten years in prison for first-
degree burglary; and
 
(4) Cr. No. 99-0768 to ten years in prison for first-
degree burglary.
 
The judgments for the October 1999 sentences provided that the
 
sentences imposed in these four cases were to be served
 concurrently with each other. The judgments for the October 1999
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
sentences, however, were silent on whether the October 1999
 
sentences were to be served concurrently or consecutively with
 the April 1999 sentence in Cr. No. 98-1854. 
Prior to 2005, the Department of Public Safety (DPS)
 
had a practice of treating multiple sentences imposed at
 different times as running concurrently with each other, unless
 the judgment stated they were to run consecutively. Based on
 
this practice, the DPS initially calculated Simeona's maximum
 
term release date by treating the October 1999 sentences as being
 imposed concurrently with the April 1999 sentence.
 
The DPS's pre-2005 practice, however, was inconsistent
 
with the version of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706–668.5(1)
 that was in effect and was applicable to Simeona's convictions
 and 1999 sentences, which provided as follows:
 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant at the same time, or if a term of imprisonment is
imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an
unexpired term of imprisonment, the terms may run
concurrently or consecutively. Multiple terms of
imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently
unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the
 terms run consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment
imposed at different times run consecutively unless the
court orders that the terms run concurrently.
 
HRS § 706-668.5 (1993) (emphasis added.) To comply with the
 
mandate of HRS § 706–668.5(1), the DPS instituted a new practice
 effective January 1, 2005, that treated sentences imposed at
 different times as running consecutively, unless the judgment
 stated they were to run concurrently.
 
Pursuant to the new DPS practice and in conformity with
 
HRS § 706–668.5(1), Dydasco audited Simeona's file on January 29,
 2007, and notified Simeona that there were errors in the initial 
computation of his maximum term release date. Dydasco informed
 Simeona that Cr. Nos. "99-2290, 98-0304, 99-0007, and 99-0768
 sentenced on October 20, 1999, shall run consecutive to Cr. No.
 98-1854 sentenced on April 26, 1999 pursuant to HRS § 706-668.5." 
Dydasco recalculated Simeona's release dates and determined based

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
on his ten-year October 1999 sentences, that Simeona's new "max
 
out" date was September 22, 2013.2
 
On October 10, 2008, Deputy Public Defender Raymond
 
Fukuhara (Fukuhara) filed a Motion to Correct Judgment in Cr. No.
 99-0007, a judgment which imposed one of the five-year October
 1999 sentences. The motion did not seek to correct or amend the
 judgments entered with respect to the other October 1999
 sentences. On October 21, 2008, the Circuit Court issued an
 amended judgment in Cr. No. 99-0007, which provided that the
 five-year prison sentence in Cr. No. 99-0007 was to run
 concurrently with all other sentences imposed on Simeona.
 
Simeona thought that the amended judgment in Cr. No.
 
99-0007 meant that all of his October 1999 sentences would run
 concurrently with the April 1999 sentence. However, because an
 amended judgment was only requested and filed in Cr. No. 99-0007,
 and not in the cases in which the ten-year October 1999 sentences
 were imposed, Dydasco and the DPS continued to calculate
 Simeona's maximum term release date as September 22, 2013.
3
 
Between May 14, 2009, and October 12, 2009, the DPS
 
made multiple attempts to notify Fukuhara that the DPS was still
 waiting for amended judgments in Cr. Nos. 99-0768 and 97-2290,
 the cases in which the ten-year terms of imprisonment were
 imposed. By letter dated September 11, 2009, the DPS informed
 Fukuhara that because the DPS had not received amended judgments
 
2In 2008, HRS § 706-668.5(1) was amended to provide that
"[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment run concurrently unless the
court orders or the statute mandates that the terms run
 consecutively." 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 193, § 1 at 714. The
 amendment, however, only applied to terms of imprisonment imposed
on or after June 18, 2008. Id. at §§ 3-4, at 714.
 
3If amended judgments providing that the ten-year October
1999 sentences were imposed concurrently with the April 1999
sentence had been obtained at the same time that the amended
 judgment in Cr. No. 99-0007 was obtained, Simeona's maximum term
release date would have been computed as July 20, 2009.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for Cr. Nos. 99-0768 and 97-2290, the DPS "will continue to run
 
these two cases consecutive to Cr. No. 98-1854 until we receive 
the Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence for Cr. Nos. 
99-0768 and 97-2290." The DPS also notified Simeona by letter 
dated October 12, 2009, that it had spoken with Fukuhara and
 requested specific language regarding serving terms concurrently
 be included in amended judgments for Cr. Nos. 97-2290 and
 99-0768, the cases he was still serving. The DPS's letter stated
 that "[o]nce the amended judgments are in order and received,
 [the DPS] will make arrangements for you to return to Hawaii
 immediately."
 
On October 22, 2009, amended judgments were filed by
 
the Circuit Court in Cr. Nos. 97-2290 and 99-0768, which imposed 
the ten-year sentences in those cases concurrently with other
 terms of imprisonment. The DPS received the amended judgments by
 fax from the Public Defender's Office on October 27, 2009, and it
 recalculated Simeona's maximum term release date. Arrangements
 for Simeona's return from Arizona, where he was being
 incarcerated, were initiated, and he was released on October 31,
 2009.
 
II.

 
As noted, Simeona's claims against Dydasco all depend
 
on his establishing that Dydasco miscalculated Simeona's maximum
 term release date. 
However, based on the undisputed evidence, we
 
conclude that as a matter of law, Dydasco did not miscalculate
 Simeona's maximum term release date. Accordingly, the Circuit
 Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Dydasco. 
Pursuant to the version of HRS § 706–668.5(1) applicable to
 
Simeona's 1999 sentences, Dydasco was required to treat
 "[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times [as]
 run[ing] consecutively unless the court orders that the terms run
 concurrently." HRS § 706-668.5(1). The judgments for Simeona's
 ten-year October 1999 sentences did not reflect any order by the
 Circuit Court that the ten-year sentences were to be served
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
concurrently with the April 1999 sentence.4 Accordingly, based on
 
HRS § 706–668.5(1), Dydasco was required to treat the ten-year
 
sentences as running consecutively to the April 1999 sentence. 
See Alston v. Read, 663 F.3d 1094, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2011)
 (holding that DPS employees "were entitled to rely on [HRS §
 706–668.5(1)] and the original judgment received from the court
 in their sentencing calculations and were not required to go in
 search of additional courthouse records that might affect [the
 prisoner's] sentence beyond what was initially received from the
 court for inclusion in [the] DPS's institutional file").
 
Dydasco properly followed statutory mandates in running
 
Simeona's ten-year October 1999 sentences consecutive to his
 April 1999 sentence in computing Simeona's maximum term release
 date pursuant to the 1999 judgments. Until the Circuit Court
 issued amended judgments that specifically imposed the ten-year
 terms to run concurrently with other terms of imprisonment,
 neither Dydasco nor the DPS was entitled to disregard the 1999
 judgments and the requirements of HRS § 706–668.5(1). The DPS
 acted expeditiously upon its receipt of the amended judgments on
 the ten-year terms to recalculate Simeona's maximum term release
 date and to secure his release from prison. 
Based on the undisputed facts and applicable law, we
 
conclude that Dydasco did not miscalculate Simeona's maximum term
 release date. Therefore, Simeona's claims of constitutional
 violations, negligence, and punitive damages, which all depend on
 his establishing that Dydasco miscalculated his maximum term
 release date, necessarily fail.

4In opposing Dydasco's motion for summary judgment, Simeona
also did not produce any competent evidence of any order by the
Circuit Court, not reflected in these judgments, that his ten-
year terms were to be served concurrently with the April 1999
sentence. 
5Dydasco was also entitled to summary judgment on Simeona's
claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that were brought against
Dydasco in her official capacity on the additional ground that a
State, and its officials acting in their official capacities,
