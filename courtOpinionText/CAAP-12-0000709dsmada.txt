ORDER GRANTING EMPLOYER-APPELLANT’S
 
DECEMBER 06, 2012 MOTION FOR WITHDRAWAL
OF THE NOTICE OF APPEAL FILED ON AUGUST 10, 2012
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the "Motion for Order Granting
 
Withdrawal of Employer-Appellant, Delinquent, Mark's Roofing,
 
Inc's Notice of Appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals Filed
 on August 10, 2012, Without Prejudice" (Motion), the papers in
 support, the record and files herein, and noting no opposition,
 it appears as follows: 
(1) Employer-Appellant Mark's Roofing, Inc. (Employer)
 
frames the Motion as one to withdraw the notice of appeal;
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
however, Employer in essence seeks, and the court will review the 
Motion as, a dismissal of the appeal, in part based on this court's November 14, 2012 Order that included a determination that this court lacked jurisdiction over compensability issues where no decision as to the amount of compensation has yet been made by the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, consistent with Mitchell v. State of Hawai' i, 
Department of Education, 77 Hawai' i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 368, 371 
(1994). 
(2) Although Employer seeks a dismissal "without 
prejudice," any future "right to appeal is purely statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." Burke v. County of Maui, 95 Hawai' i 288, 289, 22 
P.3d 84, 85 (2001). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is granted as
 
follows. The appeal is dismissed. Any subsequent appeal in the
 underlying case may be taken as permitted by law. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 21, 2012.
