STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LAWRENCE D. McCREERY, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5P111-02021)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Lawrence D. McCreery appeals from
 
the Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order, filed
 
on July 12, 2012 in the District Court of the Fifth Circuit,
 Lihue Division.
1 McCreery was found guilty of Harassment, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp.
 2013).

On appeal, McCreery contends that (1) the District
 
Court erred when it failed to specifically find that he acted
 with the requisite state of mind (i.e., with intent to "harass,

2/ The statute states: 
Harassment.  (1) A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any
other person, that person: 
(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touchesanother person in an offensive manner orsubjects the other person to offensive physicalcontact[.]

annoy, or alarm" the complaining witness), and (2) the State
 
presented insufficient evidence of his mental state to support a
 conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs, and
 
having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the
 issues raised by the parties, we resolve McCreery's points as
 follows and affirm:
 
(1) The District Court did not err by failing to make
 
a specific finding of intent before convicting McCreery of
 harassment under HRS § 711-1106(1)(a). Although McCreery
 contends that the District Court was required to include an
 explicit finding that he acted with intent to harass, annoy or
 alarm, the law only requires that,
 
[i]n a case tried without a jury[,] the court shall make a
general finding and shall in addition, on request made at
the time of the general finding, find such facts specially
as are requested by the parties. Such special findings may
be [made] orally in open court or in writing at any time
prior to sentence.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 23(c) (2014) (emphasis added). McCreery,
 
however, did not request a specific finding at the time the
 District Court made its general findings. Therefore, the court's
 general finding of guilt was sufficient to support his
 conviction. State v. Bigelow, 2 Haw. App. 654, 638 P.2d 873, 874
 
(1982). 
(2) We review claims of insufficient evidence in the 
light "most favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact." State v. Grace, 107 
Hawai
'i 133, 139, 111 P.3d 28, 34 (App. 2005) (quoting State v. 
Ferrer, 95 Hawai 'i 409, 422, 23 P.3d 744, 757 (App. 2001)). 
"Under such a review, we give full play to the right of the fact finder to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact." Id. Contrary to his claim, the 
State presented sufficient evidence of McCreery's intent to harass, annoy, or alarm the complaining witness to support his conviction for harassment under HRS § 711-1106(1)(a). 
At trial, the complaining witness testified that, prior
 
to the incident, she had hired McCreery to represent her in a
 child custody case. The witness testified that she went to

McCreery's office to pick up some papers and that, after McCreery
 
made copies of the papers, he stood up, touched her hand, and
 said, "You look so good . . . Too bad you're married." 
Explaining to the court that she did not normally say thank you
 to compliments, the witness testified that she laughed and said
 that she was happily married. The complaining witness testified
 that McCreery then hugged her tightly and licked the back of her
 ear. 
It is well established that, under Hawai
'i's laws, "the 
mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." State 
v. Stocker, 90 Hawai
'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (quoting 
State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai 'i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 (1997)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Given the evidence and circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that McCreery intended to harass, annoy, or alarm the complaining witness by licking the back of her ear even after she said she was happily married. Furthermore, the witness did, in fact, feel harassed, annoyed, or alarmed by McCreery's actions. As such, given the circumstances, the State presented sufficient evidence of McCreery's state of mind to support his conviction for harassment under HRS § 711­1106(1)(a). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment/Order and Notice
 
of Entry of Judgment/Order, filed on July 12, 2012 in the
 District Court of the Fifth Circuit, Lihue Division, is affirmed.
