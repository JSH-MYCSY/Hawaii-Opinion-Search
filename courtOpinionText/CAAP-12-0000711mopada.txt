denial of his HRCP Rule 60(b) motion (Order Denying Rule 59(e)
 Motion), filed on July 11, 2012 in the Circuit Court for the
 Second Circuit (circuit court).
2
 
Szymanski contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion by: (1) denying Szymanski's HRCP Rule 60(b) motion
 (Rule 60(b) Motion) despite an alleged conflict of interest for
 the judge who presided as to matters decided over six years
 previous; and (2) denying Szymanski's motion for reconsideration
 of the Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion, filed pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 59(e) (Rule 59(e) Motion). 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.
 
I. Background
 
This appeal stems from a complaint for interpleader,
 
filed on July 19, 2002, by Plaintiff-Appellee Title Guaranty
 Escrow Services, Inc. (Title Guaranty) against Szymanski and
 Defendant-Appellee Wailea Resort Company, Ltd. (WRC) for the
 purpose of, inter alia, determining the rights to funds held by
 Title Guaranty in an escrow account. 
WRC and Szymanski filed cross-claims against each other 
disputing whether there was performance under a land sales contract for a twenty-three-acre parcel of undeveloped land in Wailea, Maui, Hawai
'i (the Property). 
On August 10, 2004, WRC filed a motion for summary
 
judgment regarding Szymanski's cross-claim against WRC. On
 September 17, 2004, Szymanski filed a motion for partial summary
 judgment on Counts I and III of his cross-claim against WRC. 
On October 6, 2004, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
WRC's motion for summary judgment and Szymanski's motion for
 partial summary judgment. The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo
 presided. The circuit court orally ruled in WRC's favor and
 denied Szymanski's motion for partial summary judgment. On
 October 20, 2004, the circuit court filed an order granting WRC's
 motion for summary judgment and denying Szymanski's motion for

partial summary judgment (Order Granting Summary Judgment). 
On October 29, 2004, Szymanski filed a motion for
 
reconsideration of the Order Granting Summary Judgment. On
 December 2, 2004, the circuit court held a hearing on Szymanski's
 motion for reconsideration and orally denied the motion.  Again,
 
Judge Loo presided. On December 7, 2004, the circuit court filed
 
an order denying Szymanski's motion for reconsideration. 
On April 20, 2005, Judge Raffetto entered an HRCP Rule
 
54(b) Final Judgment (Rule 54(b) Judgment) as to the Order
 Granting Summary Judgment and the order denying Szymanski's
 motion for reconsideration.
 
On April 25, 2005, Szymanski filed a Notice of Appeal 
from the Rule 54(b) Judgment. On April 27, 2009, this Court issued a Summary Disposition Order (SDO), which, upon a de novo review, concluded "that the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment." Title Guar. Escrow Servs., Inc. v. Szymanski 
et al., No. 27254, 2009 WL 1112604, 120 Hawai
'i 383, 205 P.3d 
648, at *3 (Haw. App. Apr. 27, 2009)(SDO). 
On July 28, 2010, the circuit court filed a "Final
 
Judgment as to All Claims and Parties" (Final Judgment). The
 Final Judgment resolved the remaining claims of the case and also
 reasserted the prior Rule 54(b) Judgment. On August 27, 2010,
 Szymanski filed a Notice of Appeal from the Final Judgment, which
 became appellate case No. 30697.
 
On September 19, 2011, over six years after entry of 
the Rule 54(b) Judgment, Szymanski filed the Rule 60(b) Motion based on Judge Loo's alleged failure to recuse herself. In his Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion, Szymanski argued that because Judge Loo owned stock in Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (A&B), Judge Loo had a direct financial interest in the outcome of this case and should have recused herself and not considered WRC and Szymanski's competing motions for summary judgment back in 2004. A&B was never a party to this case. Rather, on October 1, 2003, a Limited Warranty Deed was recorded with the State of Hawai
'i 
Bureau of Conveyances, which transferred the Property from WRC to 
3
  
 

 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 

 













 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 


 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wailea Estates, LLC (Wailea Estates). A&B Properties, Inc., a
 subsidiary of A&B, is a member of Wailea Estates. Thus,
 Szymanski contended that the Order Granting Summary Judgment
 served to deny Szymanski any claims to the Property and
 benefitted A&B, which in turn allegedly financially benefitted
 Judge Loo. 
On January 4, 2012, in addressing Szymanski's claims of
 
conflict, the circuit court (Judge Raffetto) filed the Order
 Denying Rule 60(b) Motion. Judge Raffetto denied the motion on
 five grounds:
 
1. The matter is moot because the Intermediate Court
 
of Appeals affirmed the motion for summary judgment ruling
and there is no causation of any consequences to Mr.
Szymanski from Judge Rhonda Loo's failure to recuse herself
in this matter;
2. Mr. Szymanski failed to show any bias by the Court
or Judge Loo;
3. Mr. Szymanski failed to show any appearance of
impropriety by the Court or Judge Loo;
4. Mr. Szymanski failed to show any appearance of bias
by the Court or Judge Loo; and
5. No reasonable person could find that there was any
appearance of impropriety or appearance of bias by the Court
or Judge Loo.
 
On January 13, 2012, Szymanski filed the Rule 59(e)
 
Motion, requesting reconsideration of the denial of the Rule
 
60(b) Motion. On July 11, 2012, the circuit court filed the
 Order Denying Rule 59(e) Motion.
3
 
On August 10, 2012, Szymanski timely appealed from the
 
Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion and the Order Denying Rule 59(e)
 Motion.
 
On October 24, 2013, this court filed an SDO vacating 
the July 28, 2010 Final Judgment. Title Guar. Escrow Servs., 
Inc. v. Szymanski et al., No. 30697, 2013 WL 5761945 103 Hawai
'i

II. Discussion
 
A. Mootness Based on Appellate Case No. 30697
 
On May 30, 2014, this court filed an order which, inter
 
3
 The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided. The order shows that a
 
hearing was held regarding the Rule 59(e) Motion on June 27, 2012, however,
the transcripts of the hearing do not appear to be in the record.

alia, instructed the parties in their appellate briefs to address
 whether any part of this appeal is moot in light of the fact that
 this court in No. 30697 vacated the Final Judgment entered on
 July 28, 2010. See Title Guar., 2013 WL 5761945.
 
It appears that the SDO in appeal No. 30697 vacated the
 
Final Judgment and addressed three points of error separate and
 apart from the Rule 54(b) Judgment entered in 2005. Title Guar.,
 
2013 WL 5761945 at *1. The points of error in appeal No. 30697
 addressed Szymanski's representation during events that occurred
 after the Rule 54(b) Judgment and the distribution of funds from
 the escrow account. Id. at *1. Thus, the Final Judgment was
 
vacated on issues not related to the Rule 54(b) Judgment
 addressed in this appeal. Therefore, the issues in this appeal
 are not moot.
 
B. Rule 60(b) Motion
 
Szymanski contends that the circuit court erred when it 
denied his Rule 60(b) Motion. "A circuit court's determination of an HRCP Rule 60 motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003). 
Szymanski contends that the circuit court abused its
 
discretion because (1) Rule 60(b) relief can be granted even
 after an appeal affirmed the underlying decision, thus the issue
 is not moot; and (2) Judge Loo's financial interest was not de
 minimis and she was required to recuse herself due to an
 appearance of impropriety, thus Szymanski should be granted Rule
 60(b) relief.
4 Szymanski contends that the United States Supreme
 
4
 Szymanski contends that the circuit court applied the wrong test to
the Rule 60(b) Motion because the court required Szymanski to show "bias in
fact," as opposed to the appearance of impropriety to the reasonable onlooker.See State v. Ross, 89 Hawai' i 371, 377, 974 P.2d 11, 17 (1998). However, the
circuit court identified as two of its bases for denying the Rule 60(b) Motionthat Szymanski failed to show "any appearance of impropriety by the Court orJudge Loo" and "[n]o reasonable person could find that there was anyappearance of impropriety or appearance of bias by the Court or Judge Loo."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court decision in Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp.,
 486 U.S. 847 (1988), is binding on this court and mandates a
 conclusion that Judge Raffetto abused his discretion in
 concluding that Judge Loo did not need to recuse herself. As
 covered below, while we agree that the issue is not moot, we
 reject Szymanski's contention that Judge Raffetto abused his
 discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) Motion.
1. Mootness Regarding Judge Loo's Recusal
 
Szymanksi contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion because relief based on a judge's conflict of interest
 
can be granted even after the judgment has become final and
 affirmed on appeal. This is an implicit argument against the
 circuit court's determination that the issue of Judge Loo's
 recusal is moot. In fact, WRC contends in its answering brief
 that Szymanski's appeal is moot because the Rule 54(b) Judgment
 was already appealed, independently reviewed de novo, and
 affirmed in case No. 27254. 
We agree with Szymanski that, notwithstanding that this 
court affirmed the Rule 54(b) Judgment in case No. 27254 upon a de novo review of the underlying motions for summary judgment, it does not mean the issue of Judge Loo's potential conflict of interest is moot. While this court conducted a de novo review of the summary judgment motions, it does not appear that any party argued to this court that Judge Loo had a conflict of interest or that Judge Loo's financial disclosure statements were presented to the court in any way. This issue was not decided. "[A] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process." In re Estate of Damon, 119 Hawai
'i 500, 508, 199 P.3d 89, 97 
(2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Szymanski, like all parties, was entitled to an impartial first review of the 
Therefore, Szymanski's contention that the circuit court required him to show
"bias in fact" is without merit.

issues. While Szymanski's Rule 60(b) Motion may be "untimely"
 
(to be discussed below), it is not moot.
2. Recusal Was Not Required
 
Szymanski contends that this court is required to
 
follow Liljeberg and conclude that the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) Motion because Judge Loo
 possessed more than a de minimis pecuniary interest in the
 outcome of the case which gives the appearance of impropriety and
 mandates recusal of the judge.
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) provides:
 
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (6) any other
reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
The motion shall be made within a reasonable time[.]
 
(Emphasis added.) HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) "provides for extraordinary 
relief and is only invoked upon a showing of exceptional circumstances." Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i 144, 
148, 883 P.2d 65, 69 (1994) (quoting Isemoto Contracting Co. v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 205, 616 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1980)). Although HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) does not provide a statute of limitations, a motion must be filed within a "reasonable" time period. Id. at 149, 883 P.2d at 70. "What constitutes a 
'reasonable time' is determined in the light of all attendant circumstances, intervening rights, loss of evidence, prejudice to the adverse party, the commanding equities of the case, and the general policy that judgments be final." Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4 
Haw. App. 286, 290, 666 P.2d 171, 175 (1983) (discussing Rule 60(b)(6) of the Hawai
'i Family Court Rules, which is 
substantially similar to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)). 
Szymanski filed his Rule 60(b) Motion nearly seven
 
years after the Order Granting Summary Judgment was filed and
 more than six years after the Rule 54(b) Judgment. Szymanski had
 
7
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 








 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not previously asserted any conflict for Judge Loo. Szymanski
 
however contends that Judge Loo should have disqualified herself
 from this case because she had a pecuniary interest in its
 outcome, which created the appearance of impropriety. Szymanski
 contends that he did not discover this fact until 2011, when he
 reviewed her financial disclosures. We note, however, that Judge
 Loo's financial disclosure statements were available to Szymanski
 in 2003 and 2004.
5 Moreover, Szymanski has not demonstrated that
 
"exceptional circumstances" exist in this case such that the
 circuit court's decision to deny his Rule 60(b) Motion was an
 abuse of discretion. See Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 291, 666 P.2d
 
at 175 (stating a six year delay before filing a Rule 60(b)(6)
 motion "may or may not be unreasonable depending upon whether any
 exceptional circumstances are present which would mitigate the
 lengthy delay in bringing the motion").
 
Moreover, even assuming that "exceptional 
circumstances" under HRCP Rule 60(b) equates to whether Judge Loo was required to recuse herself years earlier, we conclude she was not so required in this case. In State v. Ross, 89 Hawai
'i 371, 
974 P.2d 11 (1998), the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i provided a "two­
part analysis for disqualification or recusal cases." Id. at 
377, 974 P.2d at 17. "In the first part, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 601-7 is applied to determine whether the alleged bias is covered by any of the specific instances prohibited therein." Id. 
If the alleged bias falls outside of the provision of HRS
§ 601-7, the court may then turn, if appropriate, to the
notions of due process described in [State v. Brown, 70 Haw.
 
5
 The Financial Disclosure Statements that Szymanski attached to his
Rule 60(b) Motion, used to show Judge Loo's financial investments at the time
she presided over the summary judgment proceedings, were filed on April 1,
2003, March 5, 2004, and January 31, 2005. The Order Granting Summary
Judgment was filed on October 20, 2004. Thus, at least the Financial
Disclosure Statements filed on March 5, 2004 and April 1, 2003, in which Judge
Loo listed herself as a shareholder in A&B, were available to Szymanski at the
time of the summary judgment order.

459, 776 P.2d 1182 (1989)] in conducting the broader inquiry
of whether "circumstances...fairly give rise to an
appearance of impropriety and...reasonably cast suspicion on
the judge's impartiality." Brown, 467 n.3, 776 P.2d at 158
n.3.
 Id. (ellipses in original).
 
Based on Ross, we first look to HRS § 601-7 (1993 &
 
 
2015 Supp.), which provides in pertinent part: 
 
§601-7 Disqualification of judge; relationship, pecuniary
interest, previous judgment, bias or prejudice. (a) No
person shall sit as a judge in any case in which:
(1) The judge's relative by affinity or consanguinity
within the third degree is counsel, or interested
either as a plaintiff or defendant, or in the
issue of which the judge has, either directly or
through such relative, a more than de minimis 
pecuniary interest [.][ 
6

] 
(Emphasis added.) The applicability of HRS 601-7 is dependant on
 
 
whether Judge Loo's financial interest was "more than de minimis
 
 
pecuniary interest." The Hawai 'i Revised Code of Judicial 
Conduct (HRCJC) (2008) has defined "'[d]e minimis' in the context
 
 
of interests pertaining to disqualification of a judge, [as
 
 
meaning] an insignificant interest that could not raise a
 
 
reasonable question regarding the judge's impartiality."7 In
 
 
6
 Effective April 15, 2004, the language in HRS § 601-7(a) changed
from "any pecuniary interest" to "a more than de minimis pecuniary interest."
2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act. 5 § 1 at 7. The House Committee on Judiciary and
Hawaiian Affairs stated that the change was made so that the statute was
reflective of the language in the Hawaii Revised Code of Judicial Conduct
because "the code of conduct is more realistic for today's environment, and
this measure will reconcile the current statute requirements for judge's
disqualification with the code of conduct." S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2921, in
2004 Senate Journal, at 1454. 
7
 HRCJC Rule 2.11 offers additional guidance related to when a judge
has an interest in the outcome of the litigation and provides in pertinent
part:
 
Rule 2.11. DISQUALIFICATION OR RECUSAL 
(a) Subject to the rule of necessity, a judge shall
disqualify or recuse himself or herself in any
proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might
reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to
the following circumstances:
 
. . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
addition, 46 Am. Jur. 2d § 104 (2006) provides:
 
The general rule is that stockholding by a judge
 
constitutes disqualification where the interests of the
 
corporation in which he or she is a stockholder are involved
 
in the litigation instituted or pending before him or her.
 
The most frequently applied limitation on the general rule
 
of judicial disqualification through shareholding is that
 
the "interest" of a stockholding judge in any pending matter
 
may be too remote to be disqualifying , either because the
 
stockholding is economically insignificant or because the
 
involved corporation is merely indirectly or abstractly
 
interested in the litigation.
 
 
(Emphasis added) (Footnotes omitted.)
 
We conclude that Judge Loo's ownership of stock in A&B
 
 
was de minimis in the context of this case because Judge Loo's
 
 
stock ownership was too remote of a financial interest to require
 
 
disqualification. As stated above, A&B was not party to the
 
 
case. WRC transferred a Limited Warranty Deed to Wailea Estates. 
 
(2) The judge knows that the judge, the judge's
spouse or domestic partner, or a person within
the third degree of relationship to either of
them, or the spouse or domestic partner of such
a person is:
 
. . . .
 
(C) a person who has more than a de
minimis interest that could be
 substantially affected by the proceeding;
 
. . . .
 
(3) The judge knows that he or she, individually
or as a fiduciary, or the judge's spouse,
domestic partner, parent, or child, or any other
member of the judge's family residing in the
judge's household, has an economic interest in
the subject matter in controversy or in a party
to the proceeding.
 
. . . .
 
(b) A judge shall keep informed about the judge's
personal and fiduciary economic interests and make a
reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal
economic interests of the judge's spouse or domestic
partner, minor children, or any other person residing
in the judge's household.

A&B Properties, Inc. is a partner to Wailea Estates and A&B
 Properties is a subsidiary of A&B, in which Judge Loo owned
 stock. There is nothing to suggest the extent of how the
 purchase of the subject parcel of undeveloped land by a
 subsidiary of A&B would benefit a stock holder in A&B. If
 anything, any benefit is speculative. Wailea Estates purchased
 land that is not developed and any profits from the purchase are
 unknown. To the extent Judge Loo had any pecuniary interest,
 there is nothing in the record to suggest it was more than de
 minimis.
 
As to the second part of the Ross analysis, given that 
Judge Loo's interest, if any, was de minimis, the circumstances do not fairly give rise to an appearance of impropriety. The test for disqualification based upon an appearance of impropriety "is an objective one, based not on the beliefs of the petitioner or the judge, but on the assessment of a reasonable impartial onlooker apprised of all the facts." Ross, 89 Hawai
'i at 380, 
974 P.2d at 20. Applying this objective test, the record in this case does not reasonably raise a question regarding Judge Loo's impartiality or create the appearance of impartiality. 
Szymanski contends that, contrary to the above
 
analysis, we are required to follow Liljeberg and hold that Judge
 Loo should have recused herself. In Liljeberg, the United States
 Supreme Court addressed whether a judge should have disqualified
 himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455 (2012) due to a conflict of
 interest in the proceedings, such that his impartiality might
 reasonably be questioned. 486 U.S. at 858. The instant case,
 however, is distinguishable from Liljeberg.
 
Liljeberg involved a judge who was a member of the
 
Board of Trustees of Loyola University. Id. at 850. The judge
 
presided over a case involving an individual with whom the
 university was negotiating a land deal, and the negotiations

turned on Liljeberg prevailing in the litigation. Id. Further,
 
[t]he proposed benefits to the University included not only
the proceeds of the real estate sale itself, amounting to
several million dollars, but also a substantial increase in
the value to the University of the rezoned adjoining
property. The progress of these negotiations was regularly
reported to the University's Board of Trustees by its Real
Estate Committee and discussed at Board meetings.
 
Id. at 853. 
The Supreme Court held that "[t]hese facts create
 
precisely the kind of appearance of impropriety that § 455(a) was
 
intended to prevent." Id. at 867. The Supreme Court
 
concentrated its analysis on the fact that the judge in Liljeberg
 had a direct and substantial link to the outcome of the case,
 stating "it is remarkable that the judge, who had regularly
 attended the meetings of the Board of Trustees since 1977,
 completely forgot about the University's interest in having a
 hospital constructed on its property. . . ." Id. at 865. 
Moreover, the Supreme Court noted "it is an unfortunate
 coincidence that although the judge regularly attended the
 meetings of the Board of Trustees, he was not present at the
 January 28, 1982, meeting, a week after the 2-day trial and while
 the case was still under advisement." Id. at 866. 
Liljeberg is distinguishable from the instant case in
 
that there was a direct and documented benefit to the judge as a
 member of the Board of Trustees, because the university would
 receive millions of dollars in proceeds from the land sale and
 the value of the university land would substantially increase. 
Id. at 853. In this case, to the contrary, any benefit to Judge
 Loo from her ownership of A&B stock is indirect and speculative. 
Given the facts of this case, there is not a similar risk of
 undermining the public's confidence in the judicial process as
 there was in Liljeberg. Unlike the judge in Liljeberg, Judge Loo
 did not have a direct financial link to the outcome of the case
 and any pecuniary interest is speculative and remote. Judge Loo

only had a de minimis pecuniary interest, if any, in the outcome

C. Rule 59(e) Motion
 
Szymanski contends that the circuit court abused its

allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion." Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai

in relation to consideration of his Rule 60(b) Motion.
