SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Sunni West (West) with the offense of
 
 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII),
 
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1)
 
 
and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2014).1 West was also cited for the traffic
 
 
1HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) and (a)(3) provide:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
 person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 
(1) 	While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's
normal mental faculties or ability to care
for the person and guard against casualty;

infraction for driving improperly on a laned roadway, in
 
violation of HRS § 291C-49(1) (2007).2 West's motion to suppress
 
evidence obtained after her traffic stop was denied by the
 District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).
3 The State
 
proceeded to trial on the HRS §291E-61(a)(3) portion of the OVUII
 charge and the traffic infraction. The District Court found West
 guilty of OVUII and found that she had committed the traffic
 infraction.
 
West appeals from the Judgment entered on her OVUII
 
conviction, which was filed in the District Court on July 13,
 2012. On appeal, West contends that: (1) the District Court
 erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence; (2) the State
 failed to lay a sufficient foundation for the admission of the
 Intoxilyzer 8000 test results; (3) the District Court improperly
 took judicial notice that the use of the Intoxilyzer 8000 for
 breath alcohol testing was approved by the DUI Coordinator; and
 (4) the admission of exhibits showing that an Intoxilyzer
 supervisor had performed accuracy tests on the Intoxilyzer 8000
 and the results of those tests violated her confrontation rights. 
We affirm.

Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or
more clearly marked lanes for traffic the following
rules in addition to all others consistent herewith

practicable entirely within a single lane and
shall not be moved from the lane until the
 driver has first ascertained that such
 movement can be made with safety.

I.
 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer Colby
 
Kashimoto (Officer Kashimoto) observed the car West was driving
 weaving within its lane, then twice cross over the lane marking
 into the adjoining lane without the car's turn signal being used. 
Based on these observations, Officer Kashimoto pulled West's car
 over for the traffic infraction of "unsafe lane change, not
 traveling within its lane of travel." 
Upon approaching West's car and speaking to her,
 
Officer Kashimoto noticed that West had an odor of alcohol on her
 breath, that her eyes were glassy and bloodshot, and that her
 speech was slightly slurred. West agreed to take field sobriety
 tests, and she stumbled as she got out of her car. She then
 performed poorly on the field sobriety tests. Officer Kashimoto
 arrested West for OVUII and cited her for crossing over the
 highway's marked lanes. 
At the police station, West agreed to take a breath
 
alcohol test. HPD Officer Jason Dela Cruz used an Intoxilyzer
 8000, manufactured by CMI Incorporated, to administer the breath
 alcohol test. The test showed that West had a breath alcohol
 concentration of 0.114 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath
 -- a concentration that exceeded the legal limit.
 
II.
 
We resolve the issues raised by West on appeal as
 
follows.
 
A.
 
West contends that the police lacked reasonable
 
suspicion to stop her car and therefore the Circuit Court erred
 in denying her motion to suppress evidence. West argues that a
 traffic stop requires reasonable suspicion that criminal activity
 is afoot and that simply committing a moving violation under the
 traffic code, without the police observing a pattern of erratic
 driving, is not enough to justify a traffic stop. We conclude
 that West's arguments are without merit.
 
The police may lawfully stop a driver for a traffic

violation, including a non-criminal traffic infraction. See 
State v. Powell, 61 Haw. 316, 320, 603 P.2d 143, 147 (1979) 
("[The State's] authority to stop vehicles in cases of observed traffic or equipment violations cannot be seriously questioned."); State v. Estabillio, 121 Hawai
'i 261, 270, 218 
P.3d 749, 758 (2009) ("Here, it is undisputed that the traffic stop for speeding and vehicle registration infractions was constitutional inasmuch as it was based on 'specific and articulable facts[.]'"); State v. Barros, 98 Hawai
'i 337, 342, 48 
P.3d 584, 589 (2002) (stating that "there appears to be no doubt that Officer Hood could lawfully stop Barros to cite him for [jaywalking -- a non-criminal traffic infraction]" committed in the officer's presence). Here, Officer Kashimoto observed West's car weaving within its lane and twice crossing over the lane marking into the adjoining lane without the turn signal being used.
4 We conclude that Officer Kashimoto lawfully stopped West 
for violating HRS § 291C-49(1), and therefore, her motion to suppress evidence as the fruit of an unlawful traffic stop was properly denied by the District Court. 
B.
 
West argues that the State failed to lay a sufficient
 
foundation for the admission of the Intoxilyzer 8000 test results
 because it failed to establish that the operator was trained and
 that the device was maintained and used in compliance with the
 manufacturer's recommendations. We disagree. The State
 sufficiently established the reliability of the test results by
 demonstrating compliance with the applicable administrative
 rules. The State was not required to show compliance with
 manufacturer recommendations to lay a sufficient foundation for
 the admission of the test results. See State v. Hsu, No. CAAP­
4In reviewing the District Court's denial of West's motion
to suppress evidence, we consider the evidence presented at the
hearing on the suppression motion and the evidence presented attrial. State v. Kong, 77 Hawai
'i 264, 266, 883 P.2d 686, 688
(App. 1994).

(SDO). 
C.
 
West contends that the District Court improperly took
 
judicial notice that the use of the Intoxilyzer 8000 for breath
 
alcohol testing was approved by the DUI Coordinator. The State
 responds that while the District Court apparently believed it had
 taken judicial notice of the DUI Coordinator's approval, the
 District Court did not specifically state its taking of judicial
 notice on the record. The State argues that the District Court's
 failure to state that it was taking judicial notice is immaterial
 because this court on appeal may take judicial notice of the same
 matters that were requested during trial. We agree.
 
An appellate court may take judicial notice of 
appropriate facts. See Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
201(f) (1993) ("Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding."); see also State v. Davis, 133 Hawai
'i 102, 122, 324 
P.3d 912, 932 (2014). The State requests that we take judicial notice of the DUI Coordinator's approval of: (1) the Intoxilyzer 8000 as a breath alcohol testing instrument; and (2) the use of its Internal Standards as a accuracy verification device. See 
HRE Rule 201(b) (1993) ("A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information."). 
In support of its request, the State submitted
 
documents signed by the DUI Coordinator and certified by the DUI
 Coordinator as "true and correct" copies of public documents on
 file in the Department of Health. In a memorandum dated August
 25, 2004, the DUI Coordinator states that:
 
In accordance with Title 11, Administrative Rules, State
Department of Health, Chapter 114 'Testing of Blood, Breath,
and Other Bodily Substances for Alcohol Concentration' -5
Instrument Approvals (dated Dec. 30, 1993) the following
instruments have been evaluated by the DUI Coordinator and
approval is granted for their use:
 
Intoxilyzer Model #5000
Intoxilyzer Model #8000

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
These instruments are listed on the [Department of
Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA)] Conforming Products List of
Evidential Breath Measurement Devices (Federal Register/Vol
69, No. 134/ Wednesday, July 14, 2004/Notices).
 
. . . .
 The Internal Standards options offered by CMI (the
manufacturer of Intoxilyzer Models #5000 and #8000) have
been evaluated by the DUI Coordinator and comply with Title
11, Chapter 114-5(a)(3). Approval is granted for the use of
Internal Standards as an accuracy verification device with
each breath alcohol analysis performed.
 
The State also submitted two letters from the DUI
 
 
Coordinator to HPD Sergeant Roland Kondo, dated August 6, 2008,
 
 
and March 19, 2008, respectively, which refer to the DUI
 
 
Coordinator's approval under Hawai 'i Administrative Rules (HAR) 
Title 11, Chapter 114 of the Intoxilyzer 8000 and the HPD's
 
 
"Intoxilyzer 8000 Breath Alcohol Operator Training Program
 
 
Outline dated February 4, 2009."
 
 
HAR § 11-114-5 (1993), entitled "Instrument approvals,"
 
 
provides:
 
 
(a) Breath alcohol tests shall be performed using a
model of:
 
(1) 	Breath alcohol testing instrument;
 
(2) 	Breath alcohol testing instrument accessories;
and
 
(3) 	Accuracy verification device 
which are approved by the DUI coordinator.
 
(b) The model specifications of NHTSA for evidential
breath alcohol testing devices and for calibrating units
(referred to in this subchapter as accuracy verification
devices) for breath alcohol testers, as contained in 49 CFR,
No. 242, pp. 48854-48865 and 49 CFR, No. 242, pp.
48865-48872, respectively, are integrated into and made a
part of this subchapter. Accordingly, those models of
instruments, accessories, and calibrating units appearing in
the "Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath
Measurement Devices" as contained in 57 CFR, No. 46, pp.
8375-8376, and "Conforming Products List of Calibrating
Units for Breath Alcohol Testers" as contained in 56 CFR,
No. 54, pp. 1187-11819, are approved by the DUI coordinator
for purposes of this subchapter.

5West contends that the "CFR" citations referred to in HAR §
11-114-5(b) do not exist and therefore no devices, including the

 Intoxilyzer 8000, were approved pursuant to HAR § 11-114-5(b).
We disagree. West assumes that the "CFR" citations in HAR § 11­

 114-5(b) refer to the Code of Federal Regulations. However, it

 appears that the "CFR" citations refer to the Federal Register.

 For example, HAR § 11-114-5(b) refers to "[t]he model

 specifications of NHTSA for evidential breath alcohol testing

 devices and for calibrating units . . . as contained in 49 CFR,

 No. 242, pp. 48854-48865 and 49 CFR, No. 242, pp. 48865-48872,

 respectively . . . ." Volume 49 of the Federal Register at pages

 48854-48865 contains notices from the DOT NHTSA dated December
 

 14, 1984, regarding "Highway Safety Programs; Standard for

 Devices to Measure Breath Alcohol" and "Highway Safety Programs;

 Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices:
Publication of a Conforming Products List." 
 Volume 49 of the
 

 Federal Register at pages 48865-48872 contains a notice from the

 DOH NHTSA dated December 14, 1984 regarding "Highway Safety

 Programs; Model Specifications for Calibrating Units for Breath

 Alcohol Testers; Publication of a Conforming Products List."

 Thus, the references in HAR § 11-14-114-5(b) correspond with
citations to the Federal Register. 
 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(c) The DUI coordinator may approve, in writing,
modified versions of approved instruments, accessories, and
accuracy verification devices. Approval will be contingent
upon the continued performance of the instrument, accessory,
or calibrating within the specifications set forth in
subsection (b).
 
(d) All breath alcohol testing devices approved by
the director of health as of the effective date of this
 chapter shall remain approved unless the approval is
specifically revoked by the director of health in writing.
 
We construe HAR § 11-114-5(b) as meaning that breath
 
 
alcohol testing devices that appear in updated versions of the
 
 
NHTSA's Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement
 
 
Devices (CPL-EBMD) are approved by the DUI Coordinator. At the
 
 
time relevant to this case, the Intoxilyzer Model 8000,
 
 
manufactured by CMI, Inc., was included in the CPL-EBMD. See
 
 
Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement
 
 
Devices, 75 Fed. Reg. 11624-01 (Mar. 11, 2010).
 
 
Based on the foregoing, we take judicial notice of the
 
 
DUI Coordinator's approval of: (1) the Intoxilyzer 8000 as a
 
 
breath alcohol testing instrument; and (2) the use of its 
 
Internal Standards as an accuracy verification device. See HRE

Rule 201(b). 
D.
 
West contends that the admission of exhibits showing
 
that the Intoxilyzer supervisor had performed accuracy tests on
 
the Intoxilyzer 8000 and the results of those tests violated her
 confrontation rights. We disagree.
 
In State v. Marshall, 114 Hawai
'i 396, 163 P.3d 199 
(App. 2007), we rejected Marshall's claim that the introduction of an Intoxilyzer Supervisor's sworn statements to establish that the Intoxilyzer used had been properly calibrated and tested for accuracy violated his confrontation rights. We held that the Intoxilyzer Supervisor's statements were not testimonial and thus did not implicate Marshall's confrontation rights because the statements "were not specific as to Marshall[,] . . . were not designed primarily to establish or prove some past fact, . . . and [were] merely a record of routine, nonadversarial matters made in a nonadversarial setting." Marshall, 114 Hawai
'i at 401­
02, 163 P.3d at 204-05 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We also cited numerous decisions from other jurisdictions that had reached the same conclusion. Id. 
Subsequent decisions of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court and 
the United States Supreme Court support our confrontation clause analysis in Marshall. See State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i 354, 
373-74, 227 P.3d 520, 539-40 (2010) (concluding that a speed check card created to verify that a police car's speedometer was in proper working order is nontestimonial in nature); Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 311 n.1 (2009) ("[W]e do not hold, and it is not the case, that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution's case. . . . [D]ocuments prepared in the regular course of equipment maintenance may well qualify as nontestimonial records.") We conclude that the admission of the challenged exhibits did not violate West's confrontation rights.
