IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DORA J. GRIFFIN, Petitioner-Appellee,
on behalf of MICHAEL E. GRIFFIN, a Minor, Subject
v.
 
JEAN DAVENPORT, Respondent-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DOMESTIC ABUSE NO. 10-1-7071)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Jean Davenport (Davenport), nka
 
Jean Iwamoto, appeals from the Order Regarding Intermediate Court
 
of Appeals of the State of Hawaii's Remand Instructions entered
 
on July 19, 2012 by the Family Court of the First Circuit1
 
(family court) in favor of Petitioner-Appellee Dora J. Griffin
 (Griffin) on behalf of Minor.
 
On appeal, Davenport contends the family court erred in
 
finding that Griffin did not know until October 28, 2010 that
 
Davenport was responsible for Minor's April 2010 injury.
 
On October 8, 2010, in FC-DA No. 10-1-6987, Griffin
 
petitioned the family court for an "Order for Protection on
 
Behalf of a Family or Household Member" (Order for Protection)

against Davenport, alleging two incidents of abuse. The family
 
court granted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and set a
 
hearing for October 18, 2010. After this hearing, the family
 
court2 dissolved the TRO for "insufficient evidence."
 
On October 29, 2010, in FC-DA No. 10-1-7071, Griffin
 
petitioned the family court again for an Order for Protection
 
against Davenport, this time alleging three incidents of abuse. 
In addition to the two incidents previously alleged, Griffin
 
alleged that Davenport had dislocated Minor's arm in April 2010. 
The family court granted another TRO and set a hearing for
 
November 12, 2010. 
On November 12, 2010, an evidentiary hearing was held. 
The family court entered an Order for Protection in favor of
 
Griffin and against Davenport pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 586-5.5 (2006). The Order for Protection expires on
 
November 12, 2015. 
On December 23, 2010, Davenport filed a notice of
 
appeal from the Order for Protection. 
On April 5, 2012, this court entered a memorandum
 
opinion in CAAP-10-242, remanding the case to the family court
 
with the following instructions:
 
We therefore remand this case to the family court for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. If the
family court finds that, prior to filing the first petition
on October 8, 2010, Griffin had already learned that
Davenport had been involved in the events of April 2010
leading to Minor’s dislocated arm, the family court shall
rescind the Order for Protection.
 
If, on the other hand, the family court finds that it
was not until after the first petition was filed that
Griffin learned about Davenport’s involvement in the events
of April 2010 leading to Minor’s dislocated arm, then the
family court may maintain the Order for Protection.
 
Res judicata would bar the October 29, 2010 petition for an Order
 
for Protection if Griffin had known about Davenport's role in the

April 2010 event at the time Griffin filed the first petition for
 
an Order for Protection on October 8, 2010. See Bolte v. Aits,
 
Inc., 60 Haw. 58, 587 P.2d 810 (1978).
 
On remand, the family court held a hearing and on
 
July 19, 2012, entered an order in support of maintaining the
 Order for Protection. The family court made the following
 
findings of fact and conclusions of law:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. [Griffin] knew in April of 2010 that [Davenport]
was present when [Minor's] arm was dislocated at that time.
2. [Griffin] was informed by Ms. Kellie Shodahl
("Shodahl") on October 28, 2010 that [Davenport] caused the
dislocation of [Minor's] arm.
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
3. [Griffin] learned that [Davenport] has been
involved in the events of April 2010 leading to [Minor's]
dislocated arm when Shodahl confirmed [Davenport] caused the
dislocation of [Minor's] arm.
4. To the extent that any Finding of Fact herein may
be a Conclusion of Law, it shall be so construed. To the
 extent that any Conclusion of Law herein may be a finding of
fact, it shall be so construed.
 
Davenport timely filed a notice of appeal from the
 
July 19, 2012 order. 
Upon careful review of the record, Davenport's brief,3
 
and having given due consideration to the argument advanced and
 
the issues raised by Davenport, as well as the relevant legal
 
authority, we resolve Davenport's point of error as follows:
 
Davenport argues that Griffin's testimony was not
 
credible, and was contrary to other evidence, as to when Griffin
 
first knew Davenport was responsible for Minor's injury. During
 
the hearing on remand, Griffin, Davenport, and Minor's father,
 
Darren Iwamoto (Iwamoto), testified. There were no exhibits or
 
other evidence beyond the witnesses' testimony. Thus, the 
3
 No answering brief was filed.

hearing was basically Griffin's word against the word of
 
Davenport and Iwamoto. 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
we will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal
unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant and its decisions clearly exceeded the bounds of
 reason.
 
In re Jane Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001) (citations, internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and 
brackets omitted). 
Moreover, "[i]t is well-settled that an appellate court
 
will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of
 
witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of
 
the trier of fact." Id. at 190, 20 P.3d at 623 (citation,
 
internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets omitted).
 
[T]he question on appeal is whether the record contains
"substantial evidence" supporting the family court's
determinations, and appellate review is thereby limited to
assessing whether those determinations are supported by
credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value.
In this regard, the testimony of a single witness, if found
by the trier of fact to have been credible, will suffice.
 
Id. at 196, 20 P.3d at 629 (internal quotation marks, citations,
 
and brackets in original omitted). Griffin testified that she
 
knew Davenport was with Minor on the day in April 2010 when Minor
 
was injured, but that she did not know until October 28, 2010,
 
that Davenport was responsible for Minor's injury. Griffin
 
testified that all she was previously told was that Minor had
 
fallen. Iwamoto testified, to the contrary, that he told Griffin
 
in April 2010 that Minor's injury occurred when Davenport was
 
holding Minor's hand and Minor pulled away, popping his elbow. 
Davenport gave similar testimony. 
Because there is evidence in the record to support the
 
family court's findings and conclusions, and because the
 
credibility of witnesses and the weight of their testimony are 
4

within the province of the trier of fact, we will not disturb the
 
family court's rulings.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Regarding
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals of the State of Hawaii's Remand
 Instructions entered on July 19, 2012, by the Family Court of the
 
First Circuit is affirmed.
