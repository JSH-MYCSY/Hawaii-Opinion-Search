IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N.A., Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DYLAN THEDE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0115)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this credit card debt collection case, Defendant-
Appellant Dylan Thede appeals pro se from the Judgment, filed
 
July 19, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit ("Circuit
 Court").
1 Plaintiff-Appellee Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.
 
("Citibank") moved successfully for summary judgment and secured
 judgment in the amount of $44,335.90 on its complaint for an
 "account stated." 
Thede challenges the judgment on three bases: (1)
 
"Existence of Genuine Issues of Material Fact"; (2) "Validity of
 [Citibank's] Affidavit" in support of its motion for summary
 judgment; and (3) "Validity of [Citibank's] Standing and Court
 Jurisdiction."
2 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

 Thede's points of error do not specify the nature of the error or
state where in the record the alleged error occurred, and thus may be
disregarded for failure to comply with the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure. See Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4); Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116
Hawai'i 239, 274, 172 P.3d 983, 1018 (2007). However, as this court "observes
a policy of affording pro se litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases
heard on the merits, where possible,'" Hawaiian Properties, Ltd. v. Tauala,125 Hawai' i 176, 181 n.6, 254 P.3d 487, 492 n.6 (App. 2011) (quoting O'Connor 
v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)), we
review Thede's points of error to the extent possible. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise as well as
 the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Thede's points of
 error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1 & 2) We review a trial court's grant of summary 
judgment de novo. Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 
P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (citing Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai
'i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000)). Summary 
judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Haw. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also First Ins. Co. of Haw. v. A&B Props., 126 Hawai
'i 406, 413–14, 271 P.3d 
1165, 1172–73 (2012). "To be admissible, documents must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of [Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 
56(e)] and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence." Takaki v. Allied Mach. Corp., 
87 Hawai
'i 57, 69, 951, P.2d 507, 519 (App. 1998) (quoting 10A 
Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil § 2722, at 58–60 (2d ed. 1983)). 
In support of its motion for summary judgment, Citibank
 
provided evidence including an affidavit of Ryan Cogan, the
 custodian of records for Citicorp Credit Services, Inc. (USA), a
 subsidiary of Citibank responsible for servicing Citibank-owned
 accounts. We consider then whether Cogan's affidavit presented
 admissible evidence and properly authenticated the attached
 exhibit.
 
In Citibank, N.A. v. Freitas, No. CAAP-13-0000208, 2014
 
WL 2440137 (Haw. Ct. App. May 29, 2014) reconsideration denied,
 2014 WL 2921854 (Haw. Ct. App. June 26, 2014), certiorari denied,
 2014 WL 5470749 (Haw. Oct. 24, 2014), this court held that an
 affidavit from Cogan satisfied the requirements of the analogous
 District Court Rules of Civil Procedure ("DCRCP") Rule 56(e),

 DCRCP Rule 56(e) was adopted from HRCP Rule 56(e), with changes to
gender neutral language. See Dist. Ct. R. Civ. P. cmt.

where, as he does here, Cogan averred that "[a]s a custodian of
 
records, [he had] knowledge of, and access to, account
 information and records concerning the defendant's Citibank
 account number . . ., which is the subject of this
 lawsuit. . . ." Id. at *2. In Freitas, Cogan also stated, as he
 
does here, that the attached exhibits were business records
 created and maintained by the bank in the course of regularly
 conducted business activity, and the attached account balance
 statements demonstrated periodic payments from the defendant to
 plaintiff bank. Id.
 
Thus, as it did in Freitas, Cogan's affidavit here
 
satisfied the requirements of HRCP Rule 56(e). Id.; see Capital
 
One Bank (USA), N.A. v. Huffman, No. CAAP-13-0003149, 2014 WL
 6488771, at *3 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2014) (holding that it
 could be reasonably inferred that an affiant "had personal
 knowledge about the policies and procedures that pertain to [a
 bank's] various credit card accounts" when the affiant testified
 that his or her position was "responsible for verifying the
 amounts due and owing [the bank] on its credit card accounts."
 (original brackets omitted)).
 
Any other arguments advanced by Thede in support of the
 
proposition that there were genuine issues of material fact which
 precluded entry of summary judgment are insufficiently argued
 and/or supported in his briefs to this court or the record.

Indeed, summary judgment here was proper because Citibank met its
 initial burden and Thede failed to demonstrate any genuine issues
 of material fact. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 56(e). As such, the

 In his reply brief, Thede additionally contends that Citibank's
evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment was "effectively
nullifie[d]" because he claims the Circuit Court signed an order granting his 
motion to strike that evidence. Thede apparently presented his motion tostrike at the motion for summary judgment hearing. However, contrary toThede's contention, the purported order granting his motion to strike containsno file stamp showing that it was actually filed by the court and, moreover,the Circuit Court's April 30, 2012 order granting summary judgment to Citibankstates that Thede's motion to strike was denied. Thede fails to provide atranscript of the summary judgment hearing, and thus cannot demonstrate that
there was any contrary oral ruling by the court.  Bettencourt v. 
Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("The burden is
upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the
record, and he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate
transcript." (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw.
App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))).

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
record supports the Circuit Court's conclusion that an "account
 
stated" had been created between the parties. See id.; see also,
 
e.g., Barwick Pac. Carpet v. Kam Haw. Constr., Inc., 2 Haw. App.
 253, 257, 630 P.2d 638, 641 (1981) (affirming trial court's
 conclusion that an "account stated" had been created where
 invoices were sent to and received by contractor without
 objection); see also Hew v. Aruda, 51 Haw. 451, 458, 462 P.2d
 476, 480–81 (1969) ("[S]ilence in the light of previous dealings
 between parties may operate as assent." (citing 6 Corbin on
 Contracts § 1313, at 270-71 (1962)). Accordingly, Thede's first
 two points of error fail.
 
(3) In his third point of error, Thede argues that the 
Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case and that the case was not commenced by a real party-in-interest under HRCP Rule 17(a). To that end, Thede claims that he was "not in receipt of any document or information which states that [Citibank] is the real party at [sic] interest or is properly registered to bring an action in the State of Hawai
'i." We find 
these arguments to be without merit. 
The Circuit Court properly exercised jurisdiction over
 
Citibank's complaint. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 603-21.5(a)(3) (Supp.
 2010). Here, the amount in controversy claimed by Citibank was
 $42,763.40, an amount greater than the statutory maximum amount
 for the District Court's jurisdiction over this case at the time
 that Citibank filed its complaint. See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 604-5
 
(Supp. 2010). Therefore, the Circuit Court had subject matter
 jurisdiction over the matter.
 
Thede argues that Citibank lacked standing to initiate
 
the action against him because it could not prove it had standing
 without "the scrutiny of a trial." We disagree.
 
As a general rule, whether a party has standing is
measured by the three part "injury in fact" test: [i]
he or she has suffered an actual or threatened injury
as a result of the defendant's wrongful conduct, [ii]
the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's
actions, and [iii] a favorable decision would likely
provide relief for a plaintiff's injury.

reconsideration denied, 82 Hawai' i 156, 920 P.2d 370 (1996).

(1997). Here, Citibank's evidence, presented through Cogan's
 
affidavit and the monthly billing statements, demonstrated that
 (i) Citibank was harmed (ii) by Thede and that (iii) a judicial
 determination in its favor could result in a damages award that
 would provide Citibank with a remedy for this injury. Id.; see
 
Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. v. Stewart, No. CAAP-11-0000128,
 2013 WL 4711234 at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2013). 
Accordingly, Thede has failed to demonstrate that Citibank did
 not have standing, and the third point of error fails.
 
Therefore, the July 19, 2012 Judgment entered in
 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
