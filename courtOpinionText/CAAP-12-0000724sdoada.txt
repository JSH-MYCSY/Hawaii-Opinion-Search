IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
HERBERT BROWN, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR NO. 03-1-0926)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)1
 
resentenced Defendant-Appellant Herbert Brown (Brown) to
 
consecutive extended terms of imprisonment after an extended-term
 eligibility trial. On appeal, Brown argues that: (1) the Circuit
 Court plainly erred in sentencing him to extended terms of
 imprisonment because he claims that the extended-term statute in
 effect at the time of his charged offenses was void ab initio;
 (2) the Circuit Court erred in conducting jury selection for the
 extended-term eligibility trial; and (3) at the extended-term
 eligibility trial, the Circuit Court erred in admitting Brown's
 judgment of conviction, which Brown claims was void, to prove
 that he was convicted of the charged offenses. We affirm.

I.
 
A.
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Brown with nine counts of third-degree sexual assault for subjecting to sexual contact a minor under fourteen years old. There were three complaining witnesses, Minor 1, Minor 2, and Minor 3. Counts 3 through 9, which involved Minor 3, were dismissed without prejudice, and the State proceeded to trial on the charges involving Minor 1 (Count 1) and Minor 2 (Count 2). 
After a jury trial, Brown was found guilty as charged
 
on Counts 1 and 2. The State filed a motion for extended terms
 of imprisonment on the grounds that Brown was a "persistent
 offender" and "multiple offender," whose imprisonment for
 extended terms was necessary for the protection of the public. 
See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 706-661, -662(1), -662(4)(a)
 (Supp. 2001). The Circuit Court granted the State's motion, and
 it sentenced Brown to extended ten-year terms of imprisonment on
 Counts 1 and 2 to be served consecutively, for a total of twenty
 years of imprisonment. The Circuit Court entered its original
 Judgment on September 27, 2004.
 
B.
 
Brown filed a direct appeal of his convictions and 
sentence. On September 26, 2005, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
issued a Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed Brown's convictions and sentence. State v. Brown, No. 26911, 2005 WL 
2338855 (Hawai
'i Sept. 26, 2005). Among the arguments considered 
and rejected by the supreme court was Brown's claim that Hawai
'i's extended-term sentencing scheme violated the Sixth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id., 2005 WL 
2338855, at *1-2. 
Brown thereafter filed a petition for writ of habeas
 
corpus in the United State District Court for the District of
 Hawaii (Federal District Court). Brown asserted in his petition
 that his extended-term sentence "violated the Sixth Amendment's 
trial-by-jury clause . . . , pursuant to the rationale of
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and its progeny." 
The Federal District Court concluded that Brown's extended-term
 sentencing violated Apprendi, granted Brown's petition, and
 ordered that Brown be resentenced.
 
C.
 
The State sought to resentence Brown to extended terms
 
of imprisonment. The Circuit Court empaneled a jury to determine
 whether Brown was eligible for extended terms and held an
 extended-term eligibility trial. The purpose of this trial was
 to have the jury determine whether it found, beyond a reasonable
 doubt, the facts necessary for the imposition of extended terms
 of imprisonment against Brown. At the conclusion of the trial,
 the jury found that the State had proven beyond a reasonable
 doubt the facts necessary to impose extended terms of
 imprisonment against Brown as both a persistent offender and a
 multiple offender on Count 1 and Count 2. The Circuit Court
 subsequently resentenced Brown to extended ten-year terms of
 imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2 to be served consecutively to each
 other. The Circuit Court filed its Amended Judgment on August 3,
 2012, and this appeal followed.
 
II.

 
We resolve Brown's arguments on appeal as follows.

 
A.
 
Citing State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai 'i 432, 168 P.3d 
562 (2007) (Maugaotega II), Brown contends that the extended-term statute in effect at the time of the offenses charged in Counts 1 and 2 was void ab initio.  Based on this premise, he argues as 
follows: (1) because the extended-term statute in effect was void ab initio, there was no statute in existence which authorized the Circuit Court to impose extended terms of imprisonment when it originally sentenced Brown; (2) the Circuit Court's original extended-term sentence should therefore be viewed as an ordinary-term sentence; and (3) if his original sentence is viewed as an ordinary-term sentence, his current extended-term sentence is 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
harsher than his original sentence (for the same conduct), which
 
Brown asserts constitutes a violation of his due process rights.
 
Brown's argument is based on a false premise -- that 
the extended-term statute in effect at the time of the offenses charged in Counts 1 and 2 was void ab initio -- and therefore his argument fails. As cases decided after Maugaotega II by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court and this court have made clear, the 
extended-term statute in effect at the time of the offenses charged in Counts 1 and 2 was not void ab initio. See State v. 
Jess, 117 Hawaii 381, 386–89, 406–15, 184 P.3d 133, 138–41, 158–67 (2008); State v. Mark, 123 Hawai
'i 205, 248–50, 231 P.3d 
478, 521–23 (2010); State v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai 'i 68, 79–82, 
185 P.3d 816, 827–830 (App. 2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai
'i at 398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; 
Gomes v. State, No. 30617, 2011 WL 2438768, at *1–2 (Hawai 'i App. 
June 6, 2011) (SDO). Thus, the Circuit Court had a statutory basis for imposing extended terms of imprisonment when it imposed Brown's original sentence. Brown's current extended-term sentence is not harsher than his original sentence, and the Circuit Court's resentencing did not violate Brown's due process rights. 
Brown's claim that the Circuit Court could not 
resentence him to extended terms of imprisonment after his original extended-term sentence was set aside by the Federal District Court is also refuted by cases authorizing extended-term resentencing in the aftermath of the Legislature's 2007 amendments to Hawai
'i's extended-term sentencing scheme. See 
Jess, 117 Hawaii at 386–89, 406–15, 184 P.3d at 138–41, 158–67; Mark, 123 Hawai
'i at 248–50, 231 P.3d at 521–23; Cutsinger, 118 
Hawai'i at 79–82, 185 P.3d at 827–830. During the Second Special 
Session of 2007, the Legislature amended Hawai 'i's extended-term 
sentencing scheme for the purpose of ensuring "that the procedures used to impose extended terms of imprisonment comply with the requirements set forth by the United States Supreme Court and Hawaii supreme court." 2007 Haw. Sess. L., Second

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Special Session, Act 1 (Act 1), § 1 at 2. Among other things, 
Act 1 provides defendants with the right to have a jury find the facts necessary for the imposition of an extended term of imprisonment, under a beyond a reasonable doubt standard, before the court may impose an extended term. Id. at § 4 at 4. Act 1 
applies retroactively and "[a] defendant whose extended term of imprisonment is set aside or invalidated shall be resentenced pursuant to [Act 1] upon request of the prosecutor." Id. at § 5 
at 4. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality 
of the retroactive application of Act 1 to defendants like Brown, whose offenses were committed before the enactment of Act 1. See 
Jess, 117 Hawaii at 413–15, 184 P.3d at 165–67; Mark, 123 Hawai
'i 
at 248–50, 231 P.3d at 521–23.2 
B.
 
Brown contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
conducting jury selection for the extended-term eligibility 
trial. In particular, he contends that the voir dire questions
 asked by the Circuit Court were insufficient to enable him (and
 the Circuit Court) to competently determine whether a juror
 should be excused for cause and to enable him to intelligently
 exercise peremptory challenges. We are not persuaded by Brown's
 arguments.
 
The Circuit Court gave Brown ample opportunity to ask
 
his own voir dire questions to the prospective jurors. Indeed,
 Brown does not contend that his ability to voir dire the
 prospective jurors was restricted. Thus, to the extent that
 Brown believed the Circuit Court's questions were inadequate,
 
2In his points of error, Brown appears to raise a claim that Act 1 is
unconstitutionally vague. However, Brown waived this claim by failing to
present any argument to support it. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
Rule 28(b)(7) (2010) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.") In anyevent, Brown's claim that requiring a finding that an extended term "isnecessary for the protection of the public" renders the extended-term statuteunconstitutionally vague has been directly refuted by the Hawai' i Supreme
Court. State v. Huelsman, 60 Haw. 71, 89-91, 588 P.2d 394, 405-07 (1978)
(holding that a vagueness challenge to the former "multiple offender"extended-term provision would be overcome by construing the provision torequire a finding that the extended term is "necessary for protection of thepublic").

Brown was given the opportunity to ask the questions he believed
 
were necessary to enable him and the Circuit Court to competently
 determine whether a juror should be excused for cause and to
 enable him to intelligently exercise his peremptory challenges. 
See State v. Altergott, 57 Haw. 492, 495, 559 P.2d 728, 731-32
 (1977) (indicating that the trial court can protect a defendant's
 right to an impartial jury by making or permitting sufficient
 inquiry into the possible prejudices of prospective jurors).
 
A trial court has broad discretion in conducting jury
 
selection. See id. at 499-500, 559 P.2d at 734. The Circuit
 
Court conducted jury selection for the extended-term eligibility
 trial in much the same manner as jury selection for a trial on
 the underlying charges. Although the Circuit Court could have
 more closely tailored its questions to extended-term eligibility,
 it appears that the jury selection for Brown was not materially
 different than one conducted in a case where the same jury is
 used to determine both guilt on the underlying charges and
 extended-term eligibility. In addition, Brown does not challenge
 the Circuit Court's final instructions to the jury before the
 jury's deliberations, during which the Circuit Court instructed
 the jury that it must presume that Brown was ineligible for
 extended-term sentencing and that the State must prove Brown's
 eligibility for extended-term sentencing beyond a reasonable
 doubt. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Brown fails
 to demonstrate that the Circuit Court committed prejudicial error
 in conducting jury selection.
 
C.
 
We reject Brown's contention that the Circuit Court
 
erred in admitting Brown's judgment of conviction to prove that
 he was convicted of the charged offenses. Brown's claim of error
 is premised on his assumption that the Federal District Court's
 decision to set aside his extended-term sentence meant that his
 underlying convictions were void. Brown then reasons that
 because his convictions were void, the State could not use the
 judgment of conviction to prove that he had already been
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
convicted of the underlying charges, but rather the State was
 
required to again prove at the extending-term eligibility trial
 that he was guilty of the underlying charges. 
Brown's premise that the Federal District Court's 
decision voided his convictions is erroneous. The Federal District Court did not vacate Brown's convictions, which had been affirmed by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, but only set aside Brown's 
original extended-term sentence and ordered that he be resentenced. Brown was resentenced pursuant to Act 1, which applies to situations like Brown's where an extended term of imprisonment is set aside or invalidated, and in resentencing Brown pursuant to Act 1, the State was not required to again prove Brown's guilt of the charged offenses. See Act 1, § 5; HRS 
§§ 706-661, -662, -664 (2014); Jess, 117 Hawaii at 413–15, 184 P.3d at 165–67; Mark, 123 Hawai
'i at 248–50, 231 P.3d at 521–23. 
Brown's convictions for the charged offenses were not void, and accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in admitting, at the extended-term eligibility trial, Brown's judgment of conviction to prove that he had been convicted of the charged offenses. 
III.
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
Amended Judgment.
