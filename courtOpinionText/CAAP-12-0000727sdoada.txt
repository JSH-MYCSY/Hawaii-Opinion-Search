OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JOHN ALBERT WAGNER, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 98-227K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant John Albert Wagner (
Wagner)
 
appeals from the Order Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside,
 
or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, filed
 April 16, 2012 (Order Denying Relief), which was entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court), on August 1,
 
2012.

This is an appeal from a proceeding seeking post-
conviction relief. It appears that Wagner entered into a plea
 
agreement in the underlying criminal case, Cr. No. 98-227K. No
 direct appeal was filed from the Judgment and Conviction that was
 entered therein on November 3, 1998.
 
On this appeal, Wagner contends: (1) that information 
received by the police from a "confidential informant" was insufficient to conduct a traffic stop, search, and seizure, which preceded Wagner's arrest, plea, and conviction; and (2) the State of Hawai
'i lacks jurisdiction over his crimes committed

within the boundaries of the State because of the Apology
 
Resolution of 1993.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant rules, statutes, and case law, we conclude
 that Wagner's appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's August 1, 2012 Order
 
Denying Relief is affirmed.
