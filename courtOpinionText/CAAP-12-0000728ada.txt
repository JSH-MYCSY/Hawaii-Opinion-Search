OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.
 
In this consolidated tax appeal, the County of Maui 
(County) appeals, and Kaheawa Wind Power, LLC (Kaheawa) cross-
appeals, from a Final Judgment issued on July 24, 2012, by the Tax Appeal Court of the State of Hawai
'i (Tax Appeal Court).1 
This case arises from Kaheawa's challenges to real 
property assessments issued by the County for taxing property on Maui (Property) that Kaheawa leases from the State of Hawai
'i 
(State). Kaheawa operates a business on the Property producing

electrical power from wind energy, with the power generated by
 
twenty wind turbines. There are two issues before us on appeal: 
first, whether the wind turbines located on the Property could be
 considered in the "building" valuation for the real property
 assessments under the Maui County Code (MCC); and second, whether
 property assessments issued by the County in 2010 validly
 assessed the Property for retroactive taxes applicable to the
 years 2007-2009.
 
In its appeal, the County asserts that the Tax Appeal
 
Court erred by ruling that the wind turbines could not be
 considered in the "building" valuation for the real property
 assessments, and thus, erred in granting Kaheawa's motion for
 partial summary judgment and denying the County's motion for
 partial summary judgment on this issue.
 
In its cross-appeal, Kaheawa contends that the Tax
 
Appeal Court erred by granting partial summary judgment to the
 County as to the retroactive assessments of the Property for
 taxes. Kaheawa asserts that a factual dispute exists over when
 the County discovered that Kaheawa was leasing the Property,
 which made the Property taxable and which affects whether the
 assessments were timely. Kaheawa also contends that the Tax
 Appeal Court erred in holding that the County had an unlimited
 time period in which to add the Property as "omitted property"
 for assessment and taxing purposes.
 
We affirm the Tax Appeal Court's Final Judgment and
 
hold that: (1) the wind turbines do not constitute "real
 property" for tax purposes under the MCC; and (2) the County was
 entitled to retroactively assess the Property for taxes in this
 case because the MCC does not create an express or implied time
 limit in which the County must add "omitted property" to tax
 assessment lists.
 
I. Case Background
A. Stipulated Facts
 
The parties agreed to stipulated facts, which provide
 
in relevant part:
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. This consolidated action is a real property tax
appeal, filed by Kaheawa with respect to the parcel of land
identified as Tax Map Key 4-8-001-001-6001 (the "Subject
Property"). The present consolidated action involves tax
years 2007 through 2011.
 
2. The Subject Property is located in the West Maui
mountain area, roughly three miles mauka from Maalaea
harbor. The Subject Property is leased from the State of
Hawaii. Kaheawa acquired a leasehold interest in the
Subject Property by executing General Lease No. S-5731 dated
January 19, 2005 (the "Lease"). . . .
 
3. The Taxpayer-Appellant, Kaheawa, is engaged in
the business of producing electrical power from wind energy.
There are currently 20 wind turbines located on the Subject
Property, each capable of independently generating
approximately 1.5 megawatts of electricity. This is a
 commercial power-generating business; the electricity is
sold to Maui Electric Company, Limited (on an "as-available"
basis) and ultimately used by businesses and/or consumers.
 
. . . .
 
5. On or about May 17, 2010, the County issued an
"AMENDED NOTICE OF PROPERTY ASSESSMENT" for each of the
 
2007, 2008 and 2009 tax years. . . .
 
6. On or about March 15, 2010, the County issued a
"NOTICE OF PROPERTY ASSESSMENT" for the 2010 tax year. . . .
 
7. On or about March 15, 2011, the County issued a
"NOTICE OF PROPERTY ASSESSMENT" for the 2011 tax year. . . .
 
8. The County is treating the turbines and the
towers on which the turbines are mounted as real property
included in "building" value for real property tax
assessment purposes. Kaheawa asserts that the turbines and
 the associated towers are equipment and machinery, moveable
and not real property.
 
9. The turbines are mounted on towers, which are
bolted onto poured concrete foundation slabs. Kaheawa does
 not dispute that the poured concrete slabs are affixed to
1
the land,  and thus are real property, included within
"building" value for real property tax purposes.
 
10. The turbines and the towers are bolted in place.

They can be unbolted and removed without any harm to either
the equipment or the land.
 
. . . .
 
13. The turbines and towers were purchased as
commercially available hardware.
2
 
. . . .
 
19. For building permit purposes, Kaheawa had to
submit plans and drawings for the concrete foundation slabs.
Kaheawa did not have to obtain a building permit, or submit
plans and drawings, for the turbines and the towers.
 
3
                          FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
20. The towers came with an instruction booklet from
 
the manufacturer, as opposed to a set of blueprints for
construction drawn by an architect. . . .
 
21. When the turbines and towers were purchased and
placed in service, Kaheawa claimed a Capital Goods Excise
Tax Credit for Hawaii state income tax purposes. Under HRS
 §235-110.7, the Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit only applies
to "tangible personal property" that meets certain
requirements. Thus, in order to get the credit, the
property involved must be "tangible personal property." HRS
 §235-110.7(e) says that:
 
"Tangible personal property" does not include
tangible personal property which is an integral
part of a building or structure . . . 
22. The Department of Taxation of the State of
Hawaii allowed the Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit claimed
by Kaheawa.
 
23. Kaheawa's Lease specifically requires the
removal of the turbines and towers at the end of the Lease
 term, subject to a right of the Lessor to elect to take
ownership. . . .
1 "Affixed" meaning that the slabs could not be removed
without significant damage to the slabs themselves and/or the
surrounding land.
2 As with many products, "Some assembly required."
 
B. Procedural History
 
Kaheawa initiated this action by filing appeals with
 
the Tax Appeal Court from the respective notices and amended
 
notices of property assessment issued by the County for the years
 2007 through 2011. In its appeals, Kaheawa challenged the
 County's treatment of alleged personal property as being part of
 the building value. Kaheawa also challenged the County's
 issuance of amended notices in 2010 that retroactively assessed
 the Property for the previous years of 2007, 2008, and 2009.
2
 
On January 18, 2012, Kaheawa filed a motion for partial
 
summary judgment, arguing that the wind turbines and towers are
 not real property for purposes of real property taxes. On
 January 19, 2012, the County filed a cross motion on the same
 issue. At a February 13, 2012 hearing, the Tax Appeal Court held
 
2
 These separate appeals were consolidated into a single action before
the Tax Appeal Court.
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the wind turbines and towers do not constitute real property
 
for real property tax assessment purposes. On April 9, 2012, the
 Tax Appeal Court filed an order denying the County's motion for
 summary judgment, and also an order granting Kaheawa's motion for
 partial summary judgment, holding as a matter of law that "the
 towers and turbines which are located on the subject property are
 not within the definition of 'real property' for purposes of the
 real property tax."
 
The Tax Appeal Court's April 9, 2012 orders thus
 
determined that the wind turbines and towers could not be
 included in the real property valuation for the assessments. 
Because the assessments covered more than just the wind turbines
 and towers, a remaining issue was whether the County properly
 issued amended notices of property assessment in 2010 retroactive
 back to 2007, 2008, and 2009.
 
On June 7, 2012, the County filed a motion for partial
 
summary judgment, arguing that the 2010 amended notices of
 property assessment for 2007, 2008, and 2009 were proper. The
 County explained that up until 2005, the Property was exempt from
 taxation because it is owned by the State and real property owned
 by the State is exempt from property taxes under MCC § 3.48.530
 (2014). In 2005, the State leased the Property to Kaheawa, and
 thus the Property became taxable. The County argued that
 although the amended property assessments were not issued until
 May 17, 2010, the assessments were proper and not invalid due to
 their timing. 
On June 22, 2012, Kaheawa filed a memorandum in
 
opposition to the County's motion for partial summary judgment,
 arguing that summary judgment was inappropriate. Specifically,
 Kaheawa argued that the County "discovered" the lease when the
 County received the lease with other recorded documents in 2005,
 and that upon discovering the lease, the County had a duty to add
 the Property to the tax assessment list within a reasonable time.
 
On July 16, 2012, the Tax Appeal Court held a hearing
 
on the County's motion for partial summary judgment and granted
 the motion. The Tax Appeal Court's subsequent order stated that
 
5
  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
"[t]he Court finds that there is not an express or implied time
 
limitation on the County of Maui's ability to make real property
 tax assessments, and thus the County was legally entitled to make
 retroactive assessments of the subject property."
 
On July 24, 2012, the Tax Appeal Court entered the
 
Final Judgment. 
On August 22, 2012, the County filed a notice of appeal
 
from the Final Judgment challenging the grant of partial summary
 judgment to Kaheawa regarding the wind turbines. On August 23,
 2012, Kaheawa filed a notice of appeal from the Final Judgment
 challenging the grant of partial summary judgment to the County
 regarding the retroactive assessments.

II. Standard of Review
 
We review the Tax Appeal Court's grant of summary 
judgment de novo. Kamikawa v. Lynden, 89 Hawai 'i 51, 54, 968 
P.2d 653, 656 (1998). Moreover, "[i]nasmuch as the facts here are undisputed and the sole question is one of law, we review the decision of the Tax Appeal Court under the right/wrong standard." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In this case, we must interpret provisions of the Maui

 
County Code.
 
When interpreting a municipal ordinance, we apply the
same rules of construction that we apply to statutes. The
 
interpretation of a statute is a question of law reviewable
de novo. The purpose of the ordinance may be obtained
primarily from the language of the ordinance itself;
however, in order to construe the ordinance in a manner
consistent with its purpose, the language must be read in
the context of the entire ordinance.
 
3 On September 10, 2012, the Tax Appeal Court entered a First Amended
Final Judgment, but there is nothing in the record to indicate the basis forthis amended judgment. It appears that the First Amended Final Judgment is anullity because it was entered after the notices of appeal were filed andwithout any jurisdictional basis. "Generally, the filing of a notice of
appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA 
Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999).
Granted, Rule 4 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure provides a few
limited exceptions to the general rule, but, otherwise, a trial court may not
usually make substantive changes to a judgment after the filing of the noticeof appeal unless the presiding appellate court issues an order that remands
the case to the trial court for that purpose. Life of the Land v. Ariyoshi,

III. Discussion
 
A.	 The Wind Turbines Are Not "Real Property" Pursuant To
MCC § 3.48.005
 
The County contends that the Tax Appeal Court erred in
 
granting partial summary judgment to Kaheawa on the basis that
 
the wind turbines are not taxable "real property" under MCC
 § 3.48.005 (2012).
4 The County does not assert that any material
 
facts are in dispute, but argues that the Tax Appeal Court erred
 in interpreting applicable provisions of the MCC.
 
At the time the County assessed Kaheawa's Property
 
5
relevant to this case,  MCC § 3.48.005(B) defined "real property"
as follows: 
"Property" or "real property" means and includes all land
and appurtenances thereof and the buildings, structures,
fences, and improvements erected on or affixed to the same,
and any fixture which is erected on or affixed to such land,
building structures, fences and improvements, including all
machinery and other mechanical or other allied equipment and
the foundations thereof, whose use thereof is necessary to
the utility of such land, buildings, structures, fences, and
improvements, or whose removal therefrom cannot be
accomplished without substantial damage to such land,
buildings, structures, fences, and improvements, excluding,
however, any growing crops.
 
Given the arguments of the parties, the County's appeal turns on
 
whether the wind turbines are either "improvements" or "fixtures"
 within the definition of "real property" under MCC § 3.48.005.
 
4
 We note that, although the Tax Appeal Court's ruling held that both
the wind turbines and towers were not taxable real property, the County's
points of error and briefing on appeal only contend error with regard to the
wind turbines. We thus limit our review to whether the wind turbines could be
 
included in the assessments as real property.
5
 It does not change our analysis, but we note that subsequent to the
relevant period in this case, the Maui County Council amended the definition
of "real property" in MCC § 3.48.005 and added language pertaining to "wind
energy conversion property that is used to convert wind energy to a form of
usable energy[.]" MCC § 3.48.005 (2013). 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1.	 The Exemption In MCC § 3.48.520 Does Not Help To
Define "Improvement"
 
The County first contends that the wind turbines are
 
taxable as "alternate energy improvements." To be clear, the
 
County does not point to any provision in the MCC that provides
 for a tax on alternate energy improvements. Rather, the County
 points to the provisions in MCC § 3.48.520 (2014) that set forth
 a tax exemption related to alternate energy improvements. 
MCC § 3.48.520 provides, in relevant part:
 
3.48.520 Alternate energy improvements.
 
A. As used in this section, "alternate energy
improvement" means any construction or addition, alteration,
modification, improvement, or repair work undertaken upon or
made to any building which results in:
 
1. The production of energy from a source, or uses a
process which does not use fossil fuels, nuclear fuels or
geothermal source. Such energy source may include but shall
not be limited to solid wastes, wind, solar, or ocean waves,
tides, or currents. Alternate energy production or energy
byproducts transferred, marketed, or sold on a commercial
basis shall not qualify for exemption under the provisions
of this section. . . .
 
. . . .
 
B. The value of all improvements in the county (not
including a building or its structural components, except where
alternate energy improvements are incorporated into the building
and then only that part of the building necessary to such
improvement) actually used for an alternate energy improvement
shall be exempted from the measure of the taxes imposed by this
chapter. 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The County argues that, because MCC § 3.48.005 taxes
 
"improvements" to the land, we must consider the exemption in MCC
 
§ 3.48.520 because it is critical in determining whether the wind
 turbines are "improvements." In sum, the County's position is
 that MCC § 3.48.520 contemplates alternative energy improvements,
 including wind energy improvements, and the County chose to
 exempt from taxation only those alternative energy improvements
 not used for commercial purposes. Although this argument might
 have surface appeal, the actual language of MCC § 3.48.520 does
 not support the County's position and at most creates ambiguity.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The County argues extensively that we must give
 
significant effect to the "or" contained in the definition of
 
"alternate energy improvement" in MCC § 3.48.520, subsection (A). 
Apparently in recognition of the fact that the wind turbines are
 not attached to or part of any building, the County argues that
 the definition of "alternate energy improvement" in subsection
 (A) applies to any "construction" or any "addition, alteration,
 
modification, improvement, or repair work undertaken upon or made
 
to any building[,]" which results in "[t]he production of energy
 from a source, or uses a process which does not use fossil fuels,
 nuclear fuels or geothermal source." The County's argument
 concludes that the wind turbines in this case are within the
 
6
standard definition of "construction,"  and thus are an
"alternate energy improvement." In our view, the County's
 arguments miss the mark and lead to ambiguity.
 
The County's arguments ignore the actual tax exemption

 
language, which is set out in MCC § 3.48.520, subsection (B). 
Subsection (B) provides in relevant part that "[t]he value of all
 improvements in the county . . . actually used for an alternate
 energy improvement shall be exempted from the measure of the
 taxes imposed by this chapter." (Emphasis added.) Thus, if
 anything, MCC § 3.48.520 recognizes that there may be
 "improvements" that are "used for an alternate energy
 improvement[,]" (emphasis added) but it does not suggest the
 reverse –- that all "alternate energy improvements" are
 "improvements" for purposes of MCC § 3.48.005. Based on our
 reading of MCC § 3.48.520, that provision does not dictate that
 the wind turbines in this case are "improvements" under MCC
 § 3.48.005.
 
We further note that Hawai
'i courts have held that the 
rule of strict construction applies in tax cases and if doubt exists as to the construction of a taxing statute, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. See Narmore v. 
6
 Relying on the definition provided in Black's Law Dictionary  (7th ed.
1999), the County offers the definition of "construction" as "[t]he act of
building by combining or arranging parts or elements; the thing so built."

superseded by statute on other grounds, HRS §§ 232-16, -17 (Supp. 
2013); In re Fasi, 63 Haw. 624, 629, 634 P.2d 98, 103 (1981); In re Hawaiian Tel. Co., 61 Haw. 572, 578, 608 P.2d 383, 388 (1980). At a minimum, we conclude there is doubt as to the County's construction of the exemption in MCC § 3.48.520 as indicating that the wind turbines must be taxable "improvements" under MCC § 3.48.005.
2. The Wind Turbines Are Not "Improvements"
 
The County next argues that the wind turbines are
 
taxable under the standard definition of "improvements." The
 County urges this court to apply the Black's Law Dictionary
 definition, which defines "improvement" as "[a]n addition to real
 property, whether permanent or not; esp., one that increases its
 value or utility or that enhances its appearance." Black's Law
 
Dictionary 826 (9th ed. 2009). Considering the particular issue
 before us, we disagree that the broad definition of "improvement"
 advanced by the County applies to the wind turbines in this
 case.
7
 
As recognized in the parties' stipulation, Kaheawa 
asserts that the wind turbines are equipment and machinery. The County, in its opening brief, also expressly recognizes that "[t]he turbines are plainly machinery." (Emphasis added.) In MCC § 3.48.005, certain types of "machinery" are incorporated as part of the description of a "fixture." Given this context, and reading MCC § 3.48.005 as a whole, applying the broad definition of improvement asserted by the County would ignore the more specific language related to fixtures and machinery. As Kaheawa points out, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has recognized the doctrine 
of statutory construction known as noscitus a sociis, which helps to guide our interpretation of MCC § 3.48.005 in this case. 
There is a rule of construction embodying the words noscitus
 
a sociis which may be freely translated as "words of a
feather flock together," that is, the meaning of a word is
to be judged by the company it keeps. This is really a

 We make no comment on whether the definition of "improvement"
proposed by the County may apply in other circumstances.
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
particular rule under the general rule of interpretation
that the meaning to be given to a writing is controlled by
the context; taken from the context, both words and
sentences may be made to mean something very different from
what the authors intended.
 
Advertiser Publ'g Co. v. Fase, 43 Haw. 154, 161 (Haw. Terr.
 
1959); see also State v. Deleon, 72 Haw. 241, 244, 813 P.2d 1382,
 1384 (1991) (citing Advertiser for the above proposition); In re
 Pac. Marine & Supply Co., 55 Haw. 572, 578, 524 P.2d 890, 895
 (1974) (applying noscitus a sociis in an appeal from the Tax
 Appeal Court). As further elaborated, 
[n]oscitur a sociis may be explained as a doctrine of
statutory construction that requires that the more general
and the more specific words of a statute must be considered
together in determining the meaning of the statute, and that
the general words are restricted to a meaning that should
not be inconsistent with, or alien to, the narrower meanings
of the more specific words of the statute.
 
In re Pac. Marine & Supply Co., 55 Haw. at 578 n.5, 524 P.2d at
 
895 n.5 (emphasis added); see also Kam v. Noh, 70 Haw. 321, 326,
 770 P.2d 414, 418 (1989) (noting as to statutory construction
 that "each part or section should be construed in connection with
 every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious
 whole[]").
 
If the County's broad interpretation of an improvement
 
was applied in this case, the language in MCC § 3.48.005 related
 to fixtures and machinery would be rendered meaningless. 
It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that the
courts are bound, if possible, to give effect to all parts
of a statute, and no sentence, clause or word shall be
construed as surplusage if a construction can be
legitimately found which will give force to and preserve all
the words of the statute. 
In re Ainoa, 60 Haw. 487, 490, 591 P.2d 607, 609 (1979); see also 
Potter v. Hawaii Newspaper Agency, 89 Hawai 'i 411, 422, 974 P.2d 
51, 62-63 (1999) ("Our rules of statutory construction require us to reject an interpretation of [a] statute that renders any part of the statutory language a nullity."). The term "improvements" still encompasses a variety of things and is not rendered 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
meaningless by our interpretation of MCC § 3.48.005.8 But here,
 
it cannot apply to "machinery" which is specifically addressed as
 
part of the "fixture" analysis.
 
We must therefore consider whether the wind turbines
 
are the type of "machinery" that come within the parameters of
 "fixture" set forth in MCC § 3.48.005.
3.	 The Wind Turbines Are Not "Fixtures" As Provided
 
In MCC § 3.48.005
 
The relevant part of MCC § 3.48.005 related to
 
"fixtures" provides that "real property" includes
 
any fixture which is erected on or affixed to such land,
building structures, fences and improvements, including all
machinery and other mechanical or other allied equipment and
the foundations thereof, whose use thereof is necessary to
the utility of such land, buildings, structures, fences, and
improvements, or whose removal therefrom cannot be
accomplished without substantial damage to such land,
buildings, structures, fences, and improvements, excluding,
however, any growing crops.
 
We first note that the parties have stipulated that the
 
wind turbines are mounted on towers, which are bolted onto poured
 
concrete foundation slabs. Kaheawa does not dispute that the
 concrete slabs are affixed to the land and that the slabs are
 thus part of the real property. Given these facts, the County
 contends, and Kaheawa does not raise any counter argument, that
 the turbines are affixed to the real property.
 
Thus, the wind turbines are "fixtures" and consequently
 
"real property" in this case if: (1) the use of the wind turbines
 is necessary to the utility of the land, buildings, structures,
 fences, and improvements; or if (2) the removal of the wind
 
8 An "improvement" is broader than a "fixture." In general terms,
 
a fixture by definition is an improvement to real property,
but an improvement to real property need not be a fixture.
Stated another way, a fixture is a former chattel which,
while retaining its separate physical identity, is so
connected with the reality [sic] that a disinterested
observer would consider it a part thereof, whereas an
improvement, after being installed, may not have an identity
separate from the overall system or building in which it is
located.
 
35A Am. Jur. 2d Fixtures § 2 (2001) (footnote omitted).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
turbines cannot be accomplished without substantial damage to the
 
land, buildings, structures, fences, and improvements. See MCC
 
§ 3.48.005.
 
The parties do not dispute that removal of the wind
 
turbines can be accomplished without damage to the land or any
 structures or improvements. The parties have stipulated that the
 turbines and towers are bolted in place and that "[t]hey can be
 unbolted and removed without any harm to either the equipment or
 the land." Moreover, the County does not argue that there are
 any disputed facts indicating that damage would result from
 removal of the wind turbines. Thus, the wind turbines are not
 "fixtures" under that prong.
 
However, the parties dispute whether the wind turbines
 
are "necessary to the utility of [the] land, buildings,
 structures, fences, and improvements[.]" The County argues that
 the land is in use as a wind farm, and the wind turbines are
 absolutely necessary to that utility. Kaheawa argues instead
 that the proper construction of MCC § 3.48.005 requires that the
 machinery be necessary to the general inherent utility of the
 land or realty. The MCC provides no guidance as to whether
 "utility" should be construed to mean general utility or utility
 that is specific to the particular business or use of land at the
 time. We therefore look to traditional common law "fixture"
 analysis for guidance. See Peters v. Weatherwax, 69 Haw. 21, 27,
 
731 P.2d 157, 161 (1987) ("[T]he interpretation of well-defined
 words and phrases in the common law carries over to statutes
 dealing with the same or similar subject matter." (citation and
 internal quotation marks omitted)).
 
Traditional common law "fixture" analysis supports
 
Kaheawa's assertion that the "utility" in question refers to the
 general inherent utility of the land or realty. The traditional
 common law test for determining whether an item of personal

the realty, (2) the adaptation of the article to the use or

For purposes of this case, in determining how to

 
construe "utility" in MCC § 3.48.005, we focus on the second
 element of the traditional fixture test -- "the adaptation of the
 article to the use or purpose of that part of the realty with
 which it is connected[.]" Although we recognize that courts
 throughout the country are not consistent in how they view this
 part of the test, we believe the discussion in Zangerle v.
 Republic Steel Corp., 60 N.E.2d 170 (Ohio 1945) most
 appropriately guides our decision in this case. In Zangerle, a
 company that operated steel plants challenged the tax assessment
 of machinery and equipment as improvements on the land rather
 than as personal property. Id. at 173. Addressing the second
 
part of the traditional fixture test, the Ohio Supreme Court
 relied on the following:
 
The general principle to be kept in view, underlying all
questions of this kind, is the distinction between the
business which is carried on in or upon the premises, and
the premises, or locus in quo. The former is personal in
its nature, and articles that are merely accessory to the
business, and have been put on the premises for this

purpose, and not as accessions to the real estate, retain
the personal character of the principal to which they
appropriately belong and are subservient. But articles
 which have been annexed to the premises as accessory to it,
whatever business may be carried on upon it, and not
peculiarly for the benefit of a present business which may
be of a temporary duration, become subservient to the realty
and acquire and retain its legal character.
 
Id. at 177 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
The principles discussed in Zangerle are consistent 
with the only Hawai 'i case that appears to touch on this issue. 
In Cartwright, the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawai 'i held 
that machinery used as part of an iron works company (including 
lathes, an emery wheel, a drill press, a milling machine, a shaping machine and a grinding machine), most of which were fastened to the flooring of a building or overhead, were not fixtures. 9 Haw. at 688-89. The court noted that the machines were removable without injury to themselves or to the building. Id. at 689. Significantly, the court also stated that "moveable machines, whose number and permanency are contingent upon the varying conditions of the business differ from engines and boilers and other articles secured by masonry and designed to be permanent and indispensable to the enjoyment of the freehold." Id. at 691. 
The principles in Zangerle have also been reaffirmed in
 
more recent Ohio cases and recognized in a legal treatise. See
 
In re Jarvis, 310 B.R. 330, 337-39 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2004)
 (relying on Zangerle and recognizing that chattel specific to the
 type of business conducted on the realty will retain its
 character as personal property); Perez Bar & Grill, 2012 WL
 6105324, 2012-Ohio-5820, at ¶18 (quoting Zangerle); 8 Powell,
 supra, § 57.05[4][b], at 57-40 (citing Zangerle and stating that
 "[t]he distinction between chattel and realty should be
 acknowledged inasmuch as realty is capable of many varying uses
 and accordingly that which may be indispensable for one
 particular use may be dispensable for another[]"); see also
 Rothermich v. Union Planters Nat'l Bank, 10 S.W.3d 610, 617 (Mo.
 Ct. App. 2000) (holding that a bowling alley's pin-setting
 machines were not fixtures and, as to the "adaptation" element in
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the fixture test, "[t]he item in question should be peculiarly
 
adapted to the real property or premises[]" and "[a]n item usable
 at other locations is not peculiarly adapted for use on the land
 in question[]").
 
The County concedes it knows of no case in which wind
 
turbines like those in this case have been treated as real
 property. Kaheawa, however, notes that in Energrey Enterprises,
 Inc. v. Oak Creek Energy Systems, Inc., 119 B.R. 739, 742 (E.D.
 Cal. 1990), a federal district court held that the towers,
 motors, machinery, turbines and other related articles of wind
 towers were not fixtures, whereas the foundations of the wind
 towers were fixtures. Energrey Enterprises dealt with whether a
 
mechanic's lien existed, but the issue was resolved in part based
 on general fixture law and thus the case has persuasive value.
 
In this case, the wind turbines are only necessary to
 
the utility of the land or realty given the particular business
 that Kaheawa is currently operating. The wind turbines are not
 accessory or useful to the land "whatever business may be carried
 on upon it[.]" Zangerle, 60 N.E.2d at 177. Thus the wind
 
turbines are not "fixtures" and are not "real property."
 
We therefore agree with the Tax Appeal Court's ruling
 
that the wind turbines are not "real property" under the MCC for
 purposes of the real property tax. Summary judgment in favor of
 Kaheawa on this issue was proper.
B.	 The MCC Provides No Time Limit In Which The County Must
Make "Omitted Property" Assessments
 
In its cross-appeal, Kaheawa argues that the Tax Appeal
 
Court erred in granting partial summary judgment to the County on
 
the issue of the retroactive property assessments. As previously
 noted, the County issued amended notices of property assessment
 in 2010 for each of the years 2007, 2008, and 2009.
 
The parties do not dispute the County's position that
 
while State property is not taxable under the MCC, the Property
 became taxable once it was leased by the State to Kaheawa. The
 parties have stipulated that the lease between the State and
 Kaheawa is dated January 19, 2005. Moreover, based on the
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declaration and deposition testimony of Marcy Martin (Martin),
 
the Property Technical Officer for the County's Real Property Tax
 Division, the lease was recorded and included in a disc of
 recorded documents that was provided to the County sometime in
 the early part of 2005. According to Martin, due to a backlog of
 documents and a lack of manpower, the County did not discover
 that the Property had become taxable until December 2008. Martin
 further attested that, once it was determined that the Property
 was taxable, the County sought to assess its value, requested
 information from Kaheawa which Kaheawa did not provide and which
 delayed the assessment, and the County ultimately assessed the
 Property based on a valuation manual.
 
Kaheawa contends on appeal that the Tax Appeal Court
 
erroneously concluded that it was immaterial when the County
 discovered Kaheawa's lease of the Property, and relatedly, that
 the Tax Appeal Court erred in holding that the County had an
 unlimited time period in which to make "omitted property"
 assessments of the Property after the County discovered the
 omission. Kaheawa argues that the County had notice of the
 Property's non-exempt status upon receiving the disc containing a
 copy of the lease in 2005 and improperly failed to make an
 assessment until five years later. Kaheawa further points to
 Martin's deposition in which she testified that she and others in
 the tax division could see the wind turbines installed on the
 Property. Kaheawa urges that we interpret MCC § 3.48.165(A)
 (2014) as mandating the County to act upon its discovery of
 property that has been omitted from the assessment lists, such
 that the County's delinquent assessments for tax years 2007,
 2008, and 2009 are illegal and void. 
The County responds that Kaheawa's arguments fail
 
because, under a proper reading of the relevant MCC provisions,
 there is no time limitation on adding omitted property to
 assessment lists and, even if there were such time limitations,
 the MCC provides that an untimely assessment is not illegal or
 invalid. 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We need not and thus do not reach Kaheawa's argument
 
that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to when the
 
County discovered the lease, because we agree with the Tax Appeal
 Court's determination that the date the County discovered the
 lease is not a material fact in this case. The Tax Appeal Court
 was correct that under the MCC "there is not an express or
 implied time limitation on the County of Maui's ability to make
 real property tax assessments, and thus the County was legally
 entitled to make retroactive assessments of the subject
 property." 
Pursuant to MCC § 3.48.135 (2014), each tax year the
 
County prepares "from the records of taxable properties a list in
 duplicate of all assessments made[.]" MCC § 3.48.140 (2014)
 allows for changes in the assessment lists as follows:
 
3.48.140 Changes in assessment lists.
 
Except as specifically provided in this chapter, no
changes in, additions to, or deductions from the real
property tax assessments on the assessment lists prepared as
provided in Section 3.48.135 shall be made except to add
thereto property or assessments which may have been omitted
therefrom[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
MCC § 3.48.165(A) also addresses adding omitted
 
property to assessment lists. This section provides in relevant
 
part that, "if for any other reason any real property has been
 omitted from the assessment lists for any year or years, the
 director shall add to the lists the omitted property." (Emphasis
 added.)
 
MCC § 3.48.145 (2014) provides that assessments are
 
valid even if not completed within the time required by law: 
3.48.145 Validity of assessments.
 
No assessment or act relating to the assessment or
collection of taxes under this chapter shall be illegal or
invalidate such assessment, levy, or collection on account
of mere informality, nor because the same was not completed
within the time required by law[.]
 
A plain reading of the MCC provisions referenced above
 
establishes that they expressly allow for the retroactive
 
assessment of properties for taxing purposes, and they do not
 
18
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contain a time limit in which the County can place "omitted 
property" on the assessment lists. See Weinberg, 82 Hawai 'i at 
322, 922 P.2d at 376; Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co. (Hawai 'i), 76 
Hawai'i 454, 461, 879 P.2d 1037, 1044 (1994) ("It is a cardinal 
rule of statutory interpretation that, where the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit, we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for a different meaning."). 
Kaheawa, however, emphasizes the language in MCC
 
§ 3.48.165(A) that states that the County "shall add to the lists
 the omitted property[,]" and argues that once the real property
 tax division knew that the lease existed, and thus that the
 Property had become taxable, the County had a duty to put the
 Property on the assessment list in a timely manner. First, even
 assuming there was some time limit implied in MCC § 3.48.165(A),
 MCC § 3.48.145 explicitly states that an assessment is not
 illegal or invalid because it "was not completed within the time
 required by law[.]" Therefore, the date on which the County
 "discovered" the Property's non-exempt status is not material
 under the provisions of the MCC. Second, Kaheawa fails to cite
 authority that supports its position that a mandatory duty to add
 omitted property to assessment lists thereby creates a time limit
 under which delinquent actions are deemed illegal or void.
 
Kaheawa cites to Jack Endo Electric Inc. v. Lear
 
Siegler, Inc., 59 Haw. 612, 616, 585 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1978) and
 Aspinwall v. Tanaka, 9 Haw. App. 396, 404, 843 P.2d 145, 149
 (1992) for the proposition that the County's failure to follow
 the mandate of MCC § 3.48.165(A) -- which Kaheawa circuitously
 alleges is to add the omitted property to assessment lists upon
 discovery of the lease -- "render[s] the proceeding to which it
 relates illegal and void." However, Endo and Aspinwall have no
 bearing here because neither case stands for the proposition that
 mandatory language in a statute somehow creates a time limit when
 no such time limit exists in the applicable statute.
10
 
10 Endo and Aspinwall involved the interpretation of statutes that
allegedly contained mandatory language and in each case the court noted that
(continued...) 
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Based on our reading of the relevant MCC provisions,
 
the County was authorized to retroactively assess the Property
 
and there is no time limit delineated in the MCC in which the
 County must add omitted property to assessment lists. 
We further recognize, however, that there may be 
circumstances in which retroactive tax assessments may violate constitutional rights. In a footnote in its reply brief, Kaheawa raised for the first time the argument that the retroactive imposition of taxes presents due process concerns, citing to McKesson Corporation v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18 (1990) and In re Tax Appeal of County of Maui v. KM Hawaii Inc., 81 Hawai
'i 248, 915 P.2d 1349 (1999). 
Kaheawa does not indicate that it raised this issue in the Tax Appeal Court and clearly did not raise the issue in its opening brief on appeal. Thus, we could deem this argument waived. See 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) and 
(7). However, because it is a significant issue that bears addressing, we consider it here. See Clark v. Arakaki, 118 
Hawai
'i 355, 360 n.5, 191 P.3d 176, 181 n.5 (2008) (noting that 
despite violations of HRAP Rule 28, "because of the importance of the issue raised," the court would address the arguments on the merits). 
As expressed by the United States Supreme Court in 
McKesson and reiterated by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court in KM 
Hawaii: 
[T]he retroactive assessment of a tax increase does not
necessarily deny due process to those whose taxes are
increased, though beyond some temporal point the retroactive
imposition of a significant tax burden may be "so harsh and
oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation,"
depending on "the nature of the tax and the circumstances in
which it is laid."
 
10 (...continued)
"if the provision is mandatory, the failure to follow it will render the

proceeding to which it relates illegal and void. If the provision is
directory, however, the observance of the provision will not be necessary to
the validity of the proceeding." Endo, 59 Haw. at 616, 585 P.2d at 1269;
Aspinwall, 9 Haw. App. at 404, 843 P.2d at 149 (block quote format and
brackets omitted).
 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
McKesson, 496 U.S. at 40 n.23 (citation omitted); KM Hawaii, 81
 
Hawai'i at 257 n.12, 915 P.2d at 1358 n.12 (citation omitted). 
In this case, the Property was retroactively assessed for tax
 purposes in 2010 going back to the tax years 2007, 2008, and
 2009. The only harm that Kaheawa argues in this case resulting
 from the retroactive assessments was surprise, in that it had not
 planned for the taxes. Given these circumstances, Kaheawa has
 failed to present a basis for us to determine that the tax burden
 is "so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional
 limitation[.]" Therefore, Kaheawa's due process argument does
 not have merit in this case. 
In sum, the Tax Appeal Court properly granted summary
judgment to the County with regard to the retroactive assessments
 in this case.
