OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DON MARIE CHUNG, Claimant-Appellant, v.
 
MEDASSETS INSOURCE, INC., Employer-Appellee,
 
and
 
 
HAWAII EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,
 
INC., Insurance Carrier-Appellee
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
 
(CASE NO. AB 2011-114 (2-09-03703))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant-Appellant
 
Don Marie Chung ("Chung") appeals from the July 17, 2012 Decision
 and Order filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 Board ("Board"). The Director of the Department of Labor and
 Industrial Relations ("Director") originally adjudicated Chung's
 claims against Employer-Appellee Medassets Insource Inc.
 ("Employer") and Insurance Carrier-Appellee Hawaii Employers'
 Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. ("Carrier") the October 2, 2009
 Decision for left wrist, left knee/leg, back and thoracic area
 injuries after a work-related incident occurring on February 22,
 2009 ("February 22, 2009 Work Injury").
 
In the March 9, 2011 Decision, the Director determined
 
 
that Employer should pay for medical care related to the
 
 
February 22, 2009 Work Injury to include the request of Dr. Gary
 
 
T. Blum for authority to perform a repeat carpal tunnel surgery
 
 
on Chung's left wrist. Employer appealed from the Director's
 
 
 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 


 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 9, 2011 Decision to the Board 
The instant dispute arises out of the Board's July 17,
 
2012 Decision and Order, in which the Board modified the
 Director's March 9, 2011 Decision and held that Employer was not
 liable for Chung's repeat carpal tunnel surgery. On appeal,
 Chung challenges five of the Board's findings of fact ("FOF") and
 maintains that the Board's July 17, 2012 Decision and Order
 erroneously concluded that Employer and Carrier (collectively,
 "Medassets") were not liable for repeat carpal tunnel surgery to
 Chung's left wrist because the surgery was not reasonably
 required by the February 22, 2009 Work Injury.
 
Because we conclude that Medassets' expert witnesses 
"did not consider how [claimant's] prior injury might have been affected or aggravated by the . . . accident[,]" Panoke v. Reef Dev. of Hawaii, Inc., 136 Hawai
'i 448, 464, 363 P.3d 296, 312 
(2015), the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption that Chung's left wrist injury and symptoms were related to the February 22, 2009 Work Injury. Therefore, we vacate the July 17, 2012 Decision and Order and remand for further consideration. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In January 2009, Chung was employed by Employer "as a
 
caregiver for people with Alzheimer's disease and dementia." On
 
February 22, 2009, Chung sustained work-related injuries to her
 left wrist, left knee/leg, back, and thoracic area while caring
 for an Alzheimer patient ("Patient"). It is undisputed on appeal
 that Chung's February 22, 2009 Work Injury arose out of and in
 the course of Chung's employment. 
A. Chung's relevant pre-February 22, 2009 medical history
 
Prior to Chung working for Employer, Chung developed a
 
non-industrial left wrist condition, and underwent carpel tunnel
 
surgery with Dr. Jeffrey Lee on September 30, 2008. Chung
 experienced significant relief of her symptoms. Wearing a brace
 and careful not to lift anything more than ten pounds, Chung
 returned to work approximately one week after the surgery.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition to Chung's September 30, 2008 carpal tunnel
 
surgery, Chung was also diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1998, and
 bipolar affective depression sometime before February 2009. 
Chung had no desire to take medications for either condition, but
 occasionally saw a therapist for her depression.
 
B.	 Medassets' response to Chung's claim
 
Medassets initially denied compensability pending an
 
investigation. In a letter dated September 16, 2009, Carrier
 
notified the Director that, based on Dr. Lau's independent
 medical examination dated July 2, 2009, Medassets accepted
 liability for injuries to the left wrist, left knee/leg, back and
 thoracic. On October 2, 2009, the Director determined that Chung
 sustained an injury to her left wrist, left knee/leg, back, and
 thoracic area, based upon Employer's voluntary acceptance of the
 work injuries.
 
C.	 Chung's medical visits and procedural history following
her February 22, 2009 Work Injury
 
1.	 Medical assessments
 
Chung consulted with numerous healthcare professionals
 
following her injury. Most of the consultations were initiated
 
by Chung relating to pain which she attributed to the
 February 22, 2009 Work Injury. Some were initiated at Employer's
 request. Consistent with the facts in Panoke, Chung's pre­
existing carpal tunnel injury was asymptomatic and did not
 prevent her from working before the accident, and the medical
 evidence does not explain why the work injury could not have
 aggravated her prior condition.
 
2.	 Procedural history. 
On March 16, 2010, Chung saw Dr. Blum, and Dr. Blum
 
noted that Chung stated that she had about one day relief of her
 symptoms after the cortisone injection. He determined that Chung
 would be a good candidate for revision release, with a hypothenar
 fat flap. Dr. Blum sent his March 16, 2010 assessment
 ("March 16, 2010 Note") to Carrier, suggesting that Chung would
 be a good candidate for surgery. The March 16, 2010 Note,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
however, did not make any request for surgery. 
On April 8, 2010, Chung submitted an Application for
 
Hearing to the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. The
 
application did not identify any particular request for
 treatment. By decisions dated May 11, 2010 and November 5, 2010,
 the Director awarded Chung medical care, services, and supplies
 as the nature of the February 22, 2009 Work Injury may require. 
In its November 5, 2010 decision, the Director also ordered Dr.
 Blum to submit a treatment plan if further treatment was
 requested. Neither party appealed the October 2, 2009, May ll,
 2010, or November 5, 2010 Decisions.
 
In its March 9, 2011 Decision, the Director determined
 
that Medassets must pay for such medical care, services and
 supplies as the nature of the injury may require, including the
 March 16, 2010 Note from Dr. Blum allegedly asking for authority
 to perform a repeat carpal tunnel surgery of the left wrist. On
 March 28, 2011, Employer appealed from the Director's March 9,
 2011 Decision to the Board. 
At trial before the Board, Chung testified that as of
 
March 30, 2009, she continued to have problems with her left
 wrist, which was reinjured form the February 22, 2009 Work
 Injury. Chung was the only person to testify at the trial. At
 the conclusion of the trial the Board requested that both parties
 submit their post-trial briefs by June 8, 2012.
 
In its Decision and Order, dated July 17, 2012, the
 
Board issued its FOF and a single Conclusion of Law ("COL"),
 which states as follows: 
The Board makes the following Conclusion of Law. If
 
it should be determined that this Conclusion of Law should
 
have been set forth as a Finding of Fact, then it shall be
deemed as such.
 
The Board concludes that Claimant is entitled to and
 
Employer liable for, continued medical care for Claimant's
left wrist injury. However, the Board further concludes
that Employer is not liable for a repeat carpal tunnel
surgery to Claimant's left wrist, because it is not
reasonably required by the nature of the February 22, 2009
work injury. Further, despite the determination by the
Director approving the March 16, 2010 request by Gary T.
Blum, M.D., for a repeat carpal tunnel surgery of the left
wrist, the Board concludes that Dr. Blum's March 16, 2010
submission was a treatment note or report and not a valid
request for surgery.

This timely appeal followed.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR1/
 
On appeal, Chung alleges five points of error.2/
 
 
(1) The Board erred in the third paragraph of FOF 31:
 
The Board does not consider this report to meet the
requirements for a request for surgery. Rather, although it
is addressed to HEMIC, Employer's workers' compensationinsurance carrier, it is a SOAP treatment note that does notmeet the requirements of the Hawai' i Workers' Compensation
Medical Fee Schedule, and which also does not include theprocedure code, medical documentation justifying the needfor surgery, the estimated date of surgery, or the hospitalwhere the surgery is to be performed. It does not even request approval for a proposed surgery. 
(2) The Board erred in FOF 33:
 
The Board finds that Dr. Blum did not submit a valid
 
request for surgery on March 16, 2010.
 
(3) The Board erred in FOF 39:
 
The Board credits the diagnoses of left wrist strain
and/or contusion by Dr. Lim, Dr. Lee, Dr. Lau, and Dr.
Endicott.
 
(4) The Board erred in FOF 40:
 
The Board finds that a carpal tunnel surgery to
Claimant's left wrist is not reasonably required by the
nature of Claimant's February 22, 2009 work injury to her
left wrist. Even claimant's treating physicians, including
Dr. Blum and Dr. Sloan, have equivocated on whether
Claimant's symptoms emanate from her carpal tunnel.
Further, on March 31, 2009, Dr. Kapur noted that
[C]laimant's Phalen's and Tinel's tests were negative.
 
(5) The Board erred as a matter of law in COL 1 in relevant
 
part:
 
However, the Board further concludes that Employer is
not liable for a repeat carpal tunnel surgery to Claimant's
left wrist, because it is not reasonably required by the
nature of the February 22, 2009 work injury. Further,
despite the determination by the Director approving the
 
1/
 Chung's points of error on appeal are reorganized for clarity.
 
2/
 Medassets argues that Chung's Opening Brief fails to comply with
Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP"), and asks this court to imposepenalties consistent with HRAP Rule 30. We acknowledge Medassests' argument;nevertheless, noncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result in dismissalof the claims, and "[t]his court . . . has consistently adhered to the policyof affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the
merits, where possible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cty. Of Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 
173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)). Accordingly, and in
the absence of identified substantial prejudice, we will address the merits of
the issues raised by Chung to the extent that we are able, notwithstanding anyviolations of HRAP Rule 28.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 16, 2010 request by Gary T. Blum, M.D., for a repeatcarpal tunnel surgery of the left wrist, the Board concludes
 
that Dr. Blum's March 16, 2010 submission was a treatment
 
note or report and not a valid request for surgery.
 
 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Administrative Agency Appeals - From LIRAB
 
Ordinarily, deference will be given to decisions of
administrative agencies acting within the realm of their
 expertise. The rule of judicial deference, however, does not
apply when the agency's reading of the statute contravenes the
legislature's manifest purpose.  Consequently, we have not
hesitated to reject an incorrect or unreasonable statutory
construction advanced by the agency entrusted with the
statute's implementation.

348, 360 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citations, and
 
 
brackets omitted).
 
 
IV.
	 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Board did not err when it found that Dr. Blum did
 
not submit a valid request for surgery on March 16,
2010.
 
In her first and second points of error, Chung contends
 
 
that the Board erred when it found that Dr. Blum did not submit a
 
 
valid request for surgery on March 16, 2010. In her reply brief,
 
 
Chung argues that the "patient, the doctor, the employer, and the
 
 
[Director]" treated the March 16, 2010 Note as a request for
 
 
surgery, that the Medical Fee Schedule's notification
 
 
requirements in Hawaii Administrative Rules ("HAR") § 12-15-51
 
 
are merely guidelines that can not be used to deny a grant under
 
 
HRS § 386-21 for all "medical care, services, and supplies as the
 
 
nature or the injury requires," and that, therefore, Carrier
 
 
failed to comply with HAR § 12-15-51(b) by inappropriately
 
 
denying a valid request for surgery. 
 
The Board did not err when it determined that Dr. Blum
 
did not submit a valid request for surgery.
3/ While Dr. Blum's
 
3/
 Chung's first and second points of error might also be deemed
waived for failure to present any argument in her opening brief, and for
presenting such arguments in her reply brief "to which no answer could be
made." Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc. 114 Hawai' i 438, 472–73 n.17, 164
P.3d 696, 730–31 n.17 (2007) (citing Matter of Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76
Hawai'i 1, 14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994) (holding that arguments raised
for the first time in the reply brief on appeal were deemed waived)).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 16, 2010 Note does not meet the provisions of the elective 
surgery requirements of the Hawai 'i Workers' Compensation Medical 
Fee Schedule ("Medical Fee Schedule"), nor does it prohibit a subsequent properly documented request.
4/ As the Board notes in 
FOF 31, the March 16, 2010 Note in question "does not include the procedure code, medical documentation justifying the need for surgery, . . . or the hospital where the surgery is to be performed." In addition, the March 16, 2010 Note does not even request approval for surgery. Based on the record on appeal, there is no evidence that the Board erred when it found that Dr. Blum did not submit a valid request for surgery in his March 16, 2010 Note. 
While we determine that Dr. Blum's March 16, 2010 Note
 
was not a valid request for surgery, this is not dispositive of
 Chung's appeal. Chung's issue before the Board, and now before
 this court, is a broader issue related to Medassets' liability
 for continued medical care of Chung's left wrist, including
 repeat carpal tunnel surgery. As such, we consider the remainder
 of Chung's points of error.
 
B.	 The Board erred in concluding that the injury was not
work-related, but was unclear as to why the surgery was
not reasonably needed given the nature of the February
22, 2009 Work Injury.
 
In her third, fourth, and fifth points of error, Chung
 
contends that she is entitled to, and Employer is liable for, a
 
repeat carpal tunnel surgery on her left wrist. Although Chung
 does not explicitly argue that the Board erred in finding that
 
4/
 HAR § 12-15-51 states in relevant part:
 
(a) When elective surgery is contemplated, the attending
physician shall obtain permission from the employer at least
seven calendar days prior to the date of the proposed
surgery. Written notification shall include procedure code,
medical documentation justifying the need for surgery, the
estimated date of surgery, and the hospital where the
surgery is to be performed.
 
(b) . . . If a request for a surgical procedure has been
denied, the attending physician may not resubmit the same
request for the same surgical procedure for forty-five
calendar days after postmark of the employer's denial.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Employer overcame the presumption of compensability by
 
substantial evidence, we construe Chung's argument regarding
 aggravation of a pre-existing condition to incorporate that
 argument, and conclude that the Board erred in finding that
 Employer rebutted the presumption of compensability by
 substantial evidence. 
HRS § 386-85 states in relevant part that "[i]n any
 
proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under
 this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial
 evidence to the contrary[, t]hat the claim is for a covered work
 injury[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 386-85(1) (1993). In order to
 overcome the presumption,
 
the employer has the initial burden of producing substantial
evidence that, if believed, could rebut the presumption that
the injury is work-related. If the initial burden of
production is satisfied, the [Board] must weigh the
employer's evidence against the evidence presented by the
claimant. The employer bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion, and the claimant is given the benefit of the
doubt, on the work-relatedness issue.
 
Moi v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 118 Hawai 'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 
756 (App. 2008) (citing Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai 'i 263, 267­
268, 47 P.3d 730, 734-735 (2002)). In worker's compensation 
cases, "[t]he term 'substantial evidence' signifies a high quantum of evidence which, at a minimum, must be 'relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable person that an injury or death is not work-connected.'" Van Ness v. State, Dep't of Educ., 131 
Hawai
'i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014) (quoting Flor v. 
Holguin, 94 Hawai 'i 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391 (2000)) (brackets 
omitted) (noting that the slightest aggravation or acceleration of an injury by the employment activity requires compensation). Further, "[i]f the employer fails to adduce substantial evidence to the contrary, the presumption mandates that the claimant must prevail." Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating, 53 Haw. 406, 
409, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972) (citing Acoustic, Insulation and Drywall, Inc. v. Labor and Indus. Relations App. Bd., 51 Haw. 312, 316, 459 P.2d 541, 544 (1969)). 
In Nakamura, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court recognized that 
"'generalized' medical testimony was insufficient to rebut the 
8
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
presumption of work-relatedness" and that "a reasonable degree of specificity is required in order for medical opinion evidence to rebut the presumption of compensability." Nakamura, 98 Hawaii at 
268-69, 47 P.3d at 735-36 (citing Akamine, 53 Haw. at 410-412, 495 P.2d at 1167-68). Applying that principle, the Court explained in Panoke that employer's physicians opined generally, "because the physicians did not consider how [claimant's] prior injury might have been affected or aggravated by the . . . accident." Panoke, 136 Hawai
'i at 464, 363 P.3d at 312. 
Here, as in Panoke, Employer's medical experts opined 
generally on Chung's alleged left wrist recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome following the February 22, 2009 Work Injury because they did not consider how Chung's prior left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome might have been affected or aggravated by the accident. Id. Rather, Employer's medical experts basically opined that 
Chung's left wrist symptoms were not work-related because they believed that her left wrist work injury should have resolved shortly after the accident. In fact, while both Dr. Clifford Lau and Dr. John Endicott noted that Chung's carpal tunnel syndrome was worsening on her left wrist, that her ongoing symptoms were due to preexisting recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome, and that the recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome was not related to the February 22, 2009 Work Injury, neither doctor explained why Chung's prior injury could not have been aggravated by the February 22, 2009 Work Injury. Panoke, 136 
Hawai
'i at 464, 363 P.3d at 312. Because "generalized medical 
testimony [is] insufficient to rebut the presumption of work-relatedness," Nakamura, 98 Hawai
'i at 268, 47 P.3d at 735, the 
Board in this instance erred in finding that Employer provided substantial evidence to rebut the presumption of compensability. 
In finding that carpal tunnel surgery was not
 
"reasonably required by the nature of [Chung's] February 22, 2009
 [W]ork [I]njury," the Board noted that Chung's treating
 physicians "have equivocated on whether [Chung's] symptoms
 emanate from her carpal tunnel" and that her Phalen's and Tinel's
 tests were negative. It, therefore, is not clear the extent to
 which the Board's determination that the proposed carpal tunnel
 
9
 
 

 

 

 

 


 

 


 

 

 


 



 


 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
surgery was not reasonably required was based on its erroneous
 determination that her existing condition was not work related
 versus a determination that the surgery was not medically
 warranted. Since we remand for reconsideration upon presentation
 of a proper request for surgery, the Board should at that time
 clarify its view on the reasonableness of the surgical request. 
Because we have determined that Employer did not rebut the
 presumption of compensability, we need not address the remainder
 of Chung's sub-arguments. 
Based on the foregoing, the Decision and Order filed by
 
the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board on July 17,
 2012, is vacated and the case is remanded to the Board for
 further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
