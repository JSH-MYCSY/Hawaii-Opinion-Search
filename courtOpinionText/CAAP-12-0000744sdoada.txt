Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Jacob H. Kana, Sr., and
 
Charlene E. Kana (collectively, the Kanas) appeal from the
 
July 30, 2012 (1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Denying
 Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Complaint and (2) Judgment for
 Possession entered by the District Court of the Second Circuit,

 The Kanas' Opening Brief fails to conform to the Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. Specifically, within the Kanas' Statement
of the Case they fail to provide accurate citations to the record where thestatements in the Kanas' motion to dismiss were made. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(3). 
Furthermore, the Kanas failed to timely provide within ten days
after filing their notice of appeal a certificate that no transcripts were to
be prepared for the record. See HRAP Rule 10(b)(2).
 
Counsel is warned that future violations of the rules of court may
result in sanctions.

jurisdiction, thereby invalidating the judgment and writ of
 
possession and (2) summary judgment was improperly granted
 because (a) the moving papers for summary judgment were deficient
 as a matter of law, (b) the movant did not disprove the Kanas'
 affirmative defenses, and (c) there were genuine issues of
 material fact regarding the foreclosure and the Federal Home Loan
 Mortgage Corporation's (FHLMC) legal standing.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 legal authority, we resolve the Kanas' points on appeal as
 follows and affirm.
 
1. The District Court did not err in its 
determination that the Kanas did not specify with sufficient detail their claim to title of the subject property to divest the District Court of jurisdiction over this case. U.S. Bank Nat'l 
Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai
'i 28, 34, 313 P.3d 717, 723 (2013). 
2a.
 In its motion for summary judgment, the FHLMC
 
provided certified copies of the Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed
 Pursuant to Power of Sale showing the transfer of the subject
 property from BAC Home Loans Servicing (BAC) to FHLMC; the
 Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of Sale,
 establishing that the foreclosure sale was conducted in
 compliance with Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 667-5 through 667-10;
 Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale,
 which evidenced a posting and publication of the notice at the
 subject property; and Assignment of Mortgage from U.S. Financial
 Mortgage Corp. to BAC, the latter of which eventually conducted
 the non-judicial foreclosure sale. These documents established a
 chain of ownership from the original lender, U.S. Financial
 Mortgage Corp., to the Plaintiff-Appellee, FHLMC. Thus, FHLMC
 produced sufficient evidence in support of its motion for summary
 judgment, showing it to be the legal owner of the subject
 property pursuant to the non-judicial sale that took place on
 March 30, 2011.
 
2b. 
FHLMC was not required to disprove the Kanas' 
affirmative defenses. GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian
, 79 Hawai 'i

516, 904 P.2d 530, aff'd, 80 Hawai 'i 118, 119, 905 P.2d 624, 625 
(1995). 
2c. 
The Kanas failed to establish there was a genuine 
issue of material fact justifying the denial of the motion for 
summary judgment. The only evidence produced by the Kanas in favor of their position was Charlene E. Kana's (Charlene) affidavit, which contains conclusory assertions and irrelevant averments. Charlene merely "disputed" that FHLMC and BAC had title to the property and that BAC "was able to foreclose" on the subject property but alleged no facts supporting this conclusion. As Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(e) requires, 
an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or
denials of the adverse party's pleading, . . . the adverse
party's response, by affidavits or otherwise provided in
this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there
is a genuine issue for trial. If the party does not so
respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered
against the adverse party.
 
Because the Kanas provided no factual support for their
 
claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(e), the District Court properly
 
awarded summary judgment to FHLMC.
 
Based on the foregoing, the July 30, 2012 (1) Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Plaintiff's
 Motion for Summary Judgment and Denying Defendants' Motion to
 Dismiss Complaint and (2) Judgment for Possession entered by the
 District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, are
 affirmed.
