IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
STEVEN TUIAANA,
Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
SHAYNA M. CABANLET-CUIZON and YOLANDA U. OLSEN,
Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-1625)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Steven Tuiaana appeals a July 27,
 
2012 Judgment of Conviction and Probation entered in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit1
 (circuit court) convicting him of
burglary in the first degree pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 708-810(1)(c) (1993) and robbery in the second degree
 
pursuant to HRS § 708-841(1)(a) (Supp. 2012).
 
On appeal Tuiaana contends the circuit court erred in
 
concluding the offenses of burglary and robbery did not merge
 
pursuant to HRS § 701-109(e) (1993), which provides in part:
 
§701-109 Method of prosecution when conduct
establishes an element of more than one offense. (1) When
 
the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of

more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for
each offense of which such conduct is an element. The
 defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one
offense if:
 ....
 (e) The offense is defined as a continuing course of
conduct and the defendant's course of conduct was
 uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific periods
of conduct constitute separate offenses.
 
This court has stated:
 
HRS § 701-109(1)(e) was intended to prohibit the State from
dividing a crime, defined by statute as a continuing
offense, into separate temporal or spatial units, and then
charging a defendant with committing several counts of the same
statutory offense, each count based on a separate temporal or
spatial unit of the continuing offense.
 
State v. Caprio, 85 Hawai' i 92, 104, 937 P.2d 933, 945 (App. 
1997).
 
"Whether a course of conduct gives rise to more than one
crime within the meaning of HRS §701–109(1)(e) depends in part on
the intent and objective of the defendant. The test to determine
 whether the defendant intended to commit more than one offense is
 whether the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses
separate and distinct intents. Where there is one intention, one
general impulse, and one plan, there is but one offense. . . . HRS
§ 701-109(1)(e), however, does not apply where a defendant's
actions constitute separate offenses under the law."
 
State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawai' i 76, 81, 156 P.3d 1182, 1187 (2007) 
(Citations and brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Matias, 102 
Hawai'i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003)). 
A person is guilty of burglary if he enters the
 
dwelling of another with the intent to commit an offense. HRS
 
§ 708-810. Robbery occurs when a person, in the course of
 
committing a theft, either inflicts bodily injury upon another;
 
threatens the use of force; or uses force in the commission of a
 
theft. HRS § 708-841. Tuiaana committed burglary when he
 
unlawfully and forcibly entered complaining witness's (CW) home
 
with the intent to commit a theft within that dwelling. When CW
 
was unable to open his own safe, Tuiaana repeatedly assaulted CW
 
with an electric gun to force CW to open the safe. The circuit
 
court did not err when it found Tuiaana had separate and distinct

intents, when committing each crime and therefore, the offenses
 
of burglary and robbery did not merge.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 27, 2012 Judgment of
 
Conviction and Probation entered in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
