OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendants-Appellants Leroy Melchor (Melchor), Wanna 
Bhalang (Bhalang), Tomi Bradley (Bradley), the State of Hawai 'i, 
and the Hawai 'i Department of Public Safety (DPS) (collectively, 
the State), appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's 
(Circuit Court's) Judgment Pursuant to Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order (Judgment) filed on July 31, 2012, and challenge the Circuit Court's Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law and Order filed May 14, 2012 (FOF, COLs and 
Order).
1 
This wrongful death action arose out of the allegedly
 
inadequate medical care provided to Plaintiff-Appellee Leah
 
Castro (Castro) while she was incarcerated at the Oahu Community
 
Correctional Center (OCCC). After a non-jury trial, the Circuit
 Court found that Castro's baby, Briandalynne Castro
 
(Briandalynne), was stillborn as the result of the State's
 
negligence. Castro was awarded $250,000 in damages for negligent
 
infliction of emotional distress (NIED) and $100,000 for loss of
 
filial consortium, and Briandalynne's estate was awarded $250,000
 
for, inter alia, the loss of enjoyment of life.
 
On appeal, the State argues, inter alia, that: a 
wrongful death claim may not be brought on behalf of an unborn fetus under Hawai
'i's wrongful death statute; the Circuit Court 
erred by finding that the State was negligent and that its negligence was the legal cause of Briandalynne's death; and that

even if negligence has been proved, the damages awarded were
 
speculative and improper. We affirm.
 I. BACKGROUND FACTS
 A. Procedural History
 On July 30, 2009, individually and as the personal
 
representative of Briandalynne's estate, Castro filed her First
 
2
Amended Complaint  against the Defendants-Appellants, as well as
Amy Yasunaga (
Yasunaga), Roberta Marks (Marks), Kenneth 
Zienkiewicz (Zienkiewicz), and Keith Wakabayashi (Wakabayashi), 
in their official capacities. Count I of the complaint alleged 
that Melchor, Bhalang, Bradley, and Yasunaga, who were nurses at OCCC, failed to provide proper medical care to Castro and Briandalynne. The State of Hawai
'i and DPS were alleged to be 
negligent in training, supervising, and/or retaining their defendant employees, and also vicariously liable for their negligence as they were acting within the scope and course of their employment. Count I also alleged that the defendants' negligence and/or gross negligence was the legal cause and/or substantial factor in Briandalynne's death and Castro's mental and emotional distress. Count II alleged intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress to Castro by all defendants except the State of Hawai
'i and DPS. 
On March 24, 2011, the defendants filed a motion for
 
summary judgment. 
On October 14, 2011, the Circuit Court entered
 
an Amended Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants'
 
2
 Castro's original complaint was filed on May 6, 2008.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Motion for Summary Judgment (Amended Summary Judgment Order).3
 
The court granted summary judgment as to all claims against
 
Yasunaga, Marks, Zienkiewicz, and Wakabayashi, but denied summary
 judgment in all other respects. A jury-waived trial began on
 February 27, 2012.
 
B. Testimony at Trial
 1. Castro's pregnancy, incarceration and stillbirth
 
Castro was pregnant when she entered OCCC as an inmate
 
on May 29, 2007.
4 She had not previously received any prenatal
 
care and admitted to using "ice" during the first two months of
 her pregnancy. According to Castro, the baby's father was
 Castro's biological father. Castro had never been pregnant
 before. When she was admitted to OCCC, she did not immediately
 
tell OCCC's medical unit that she was pregnant. Castro said her
 
reason for not revealing her pregnancy was that it was
 embarrassing. It appears from her testimony that she also felt
 pressure from police officers and inmates who were friends with
 her father to not reveal the pregnancy. 
On June 29, 2007, Castro was transferred to the Federal
 
Detention Center (FDC) where a pregnancy test revealed her
 
pregnancy. As the FDC would not house pregnant inmates, Castro
 
was sent back to OCCC. On July 2, 2007, she saw Yasunaga, a

 The October 14, 2011 Amended Summary Judgment Order overruled in
part a previous May 13, 2011 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. The May 13, 2011 order granted
summary judgment as to all claims against Yasunaga, Marks, Zienkiewicz, and
Wakabayashi, and as to all claims brought by Castro on behalf of
Briandalynne's estate, and denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment
in all other respects.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nurse at OCCC. Yasunaga testified that she referred Castro to
 
Kapiolani Medical Center for prenatal care and for an ultrasound. 
However, although she was transported to Kapiolani, Castro was
 told that her appointment had been cancelled. To her knowledge,
 another appointment was never scheduled. 
After she had been sent back to OCCC from the FDC,
 
Castro was placed in what was known as a lockdown cell. While in
 lockdown, Castro began to experience spotting and what she
 described as light pinkish discharge. She asked Adult
 Corrections Officer (ACO) Hattie Reis (Reis) if bleeding or
 
spotting during pregnancy was normal. Castro stated "to my
 
understanding from what ACO Hattie told me was that medical had
 said that only if I was bleeding I guess more and if I was
 cramping then to notify them again." Castro estimated that she
 talked to Reis about three times about her bleeding. Each time
 she spoke to Reis, Reis would tell her that Reis had spoken to a
 nurse and "it was the same, same response. 'Is the pad
 saturated?'" Castro did not receive medical care after speaking
 with Reis for the third time. 
Castro also asked ACO Wanda Nunes (Nunes) if her
 
bleeding was normal. Castro testified that the response that
 Nunes related from the medical unit was "that if the pad wasn't
 completely saturated, or in her words, if I wasn't bleeding more
 or cramping, then . . . medical was not going to take me." 
After speaking to Nunes, Castro told ACO Reyetta Ofilas
 
(Ofilas) about her bleeding "once or twice". Ofilas asked her if
 
she was cramping and if the pad was saturated, which Castro
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
understood to be questions coming from the medical unit. No
 
medical care was provided through Ofilas.
 
Describing her bleeding, Castro said that "the spotting
 
started getting excessive probably about a week after of just
 spotting. And then it was blood. And then about a week before I
 got transferred to [Women's Community Correctional Center (WCCC)]
 
it went back to spotting again." 
While she was bleeding, Castro had been to the medical
 
unit of OCCC for a medication called Seroquel which she took for
 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. She did not
 
tell her psychiatrist or psychologist about her bleeding. Nor
 
did she tell the nurse who delivered Seroquel to her cell about
 her bleeding. 
Castro was transferred to the women's prison, WCCC, on
 
August 2, 2007. She was housed in the segregation area. Her
 bleeding had stopped by the time she went to the WCCC, but she
 was still experiencing discharge. However, by the third day
 after she arrived at the WCCC, Castro's stomach felt hard, she
 could not feel the baby kicking, and she felt sick after eating. 
Castro used an intercom to call an ACO named "Sula" and told her
 that her baby had not been moving for about three days. A nurse
 came to see Castro and told her a midwife would be seeing her on
 Friday. The interaction with the nurse occurred on a Tuesday or
 Wednesday.
 
Castro was seen on that Friday and was told that her
 
baby's heartbeat could not be found and she needed to be taken to
 the hospital immediately. The midwife who saw her, Joann Amberg
 
6
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Amberg) testified that this visit occurred on August 10, 2007.
 
Castro was rushed to the hospital where she learned that her baby
 
was dead. Labor was induced and Castro gave birth to a stillborn
 baby. An autopsy authorization shows that the stillbirth
 occurred on August 11, 2007.
 
2. The expert testimony
 
Dr. Jeffrey Killeen (Dr. Killeen) was qualified as an
 
expert in anatomic and clinical pathology. Dr. Killeen performed
 an autopsy on Briandalynne on August 14, 2007. Dr. Killeen
 reported that no "gross congenital anomalies" were found during
 the autopsy. He stated that in "[s]omewhere between probably 25
 and 50 percent of [stillbirth] cases you can't find a specific
 cause of death." In this case, he did not have a "specific cause
 of death" but could come up with a "likely scenario" meaning a
 cause of death that was at least 51% likely. His opinion was
 that the likely cause of death was an abruption, meaning "a
 separation of the placenta from the uterus so that there is a –
 kind of a disconnect between the maternal blood supply and
 placental nutrition from the maternal circulation." He concluded
 that an incestuous or consanguineous partnership was "a complete
 non-factor in the death of the fetus." 
Dr. Killeen estimated that the age of the fetus was
 
thirty-five to thirty-seven weeks. With regards to the time of
 death, Dr. Killeen opined: "[I]t appeared that it was most
 likely that the fetus had been dead at least 96 hours, very
 likely at least one week but very likely less than two weeks at
 the time from fetal death to delivery." 
7
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Theodore Hariton (Dr. Hariton) was qualified as an
 
expert in obstetrics and gynecology. He opined that "the
 
prenatal care that Ms. Castro got was totally inadequate and
 below the standard of care." He identified two instances where
 the standard of care was not met: first, "the initial July 2nd
 visit with the nurse practitioner in which she did not do a
 prenatal exam" and second, "when [Castro] had the bleeding
 episodes in the last week or so of July, . . . she reported to
 the guards, the guards reported to the medical facility, and no
 action was taken." 
With regards to the first instance, Dr. Hariton stated
 
that if a complete exam had been done and ultrasounds and a
 prenatal lab had been completed, "this case should have been
 classified as a high risk pregnancy . . . she would have had an
 excellent chance of having a good baby." As to the second
 instance, "[p]robably at least July 25th or later the baby could
 have been saved if she had had an obstetrical consultation." Dr.
 Hariton was asked: "Had the medical personnel at [OCCC] followed
 the standard of care under these circumstances, would that have
 prevented the baby's death?" Dr. Hariton replied: "Yes." 
Dr. Hariton opined that the "medical cause of death was
 
placental insufficiency. The placenta was no longer able to
 carry the pregnancy. It didn't have enough oxygen or nutrition
 for the baby to survive." He further stated: "Why wasn't it
 supplying it? . . . [T]hat would be a placental separation of
 some sort." Responding to Dr. Greigh Hirata's (Dr. Hirata's)
 
opinion that "the death could be because of incest," Dr. Hariton
 
8
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
stated "there's no medical evidence for that anywhere. I've not
 
only reviewed the literature, I've gone to medical libraries,
 I've gone to perinatologists, gone to colleagues, and nobody's
 ever heard of a stillbirth related to incest." 
Dr. Hirata was qualified as an expert in obstetrics and
 
gynecology, in the area of maternal fetal medicine, and in
 medical genetics. His opinions were formed after reviewing
 Castro's medical records, depositions from various "people
 involved in the correctional facility," and letters from other
 expert witnesses. Dr. Hirata disagreed with Dr. Hariton's
 opinion that "had an obstetric consult and ultrasound been
 accomplished after the initial visit on July 2nd of 2007,
 [Castro] would have been treated as a high risk pregnancy and
 would have had a successful delivery." He also testified that
 while it is possible to detect abruptions on ultrasounds, "most
 abruptions are not detectable on ultrasound." Dr. Hirata "found
 no evidence in the review of [Castro's] records that she had an
 abruption." 
As to the cause of the stillbirth, Dr. Hirata opined
 
"based on the exclusion of all the other common causes of still
 birth, the most likely cause would be a result of the
 consanguineous pregnancy." He testified that:
 
There is an article from the American Journal of Human
 
Genetics that looked at the outcomes of patient – of
offspring from related couples. And in patients and
offsprings of a father-daughter, or mother-son, or brother-
sister relationship, a first degree relative, it's estimated
that 32 percent of patients that were delivered alive . . .
. would have either passed away, or would have significant
mortality and morbidity. . . . So if I would assume, like
every other model with genetic disorders, that it's probably
worse, a higher loss rate before delivery than after birth.
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Hirata believed that the OCCC health unit met the
 
standard of care as to Castro. 
C. The Circuit Court's Rulings
 
The Circuit entered the FOFs, COLs and Order on May 14,
 
2012. The court found that the State had been negligent by
 breaching the applicable standards of care as to Castro and that
 its negligence was the legal cause of death of the baby and
 Castro's injuries and damages. The court awarded Castro $250,000
 in damages for NIED and $100,000 for loss of filial consortium. 
Briandalynne's estate was awarded $250,000 in damages for loss of
 life and for all of the damages she would have been entitled to
 had she been alive, including the loss of enjoyment of life. 
The Judgment was filed on July 31, 2012, and the State timely
 appealed on August 29, 2012.
 II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
The State alleges the following points of error on
 
appeal:
 
(1) The Circuit Court clearly erred in FOFs 12, 15-17,
 
28, and 29, because the court found that the State did not follow
 DPS and OCCC policies and procedures for medical care for
 segregated inmates;
 
(2) The Circuit Court clearly erred in FOFs 23-25, 27,
 
31, and 41-50, and COLs 70-74, because the Circuit Court found
 that the State was negligent and there was no credible evidence
 as to the cause of death of the baby or that she could have
 survived even if she had been born alive; in addition, there was
 no credible evidence to support FOF 56 that the fetus was normal;
 
10
FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) The Circuit Court erred in its award of damages to
 
Briandalynne's estate because Castro had not pled a surviving
 
negligence claim on behalf of the estate; in addition, even if a
 claim was properly raised, there was no credible evidence that
 the fetus was viable and/or had a right to bring a negligence
 claim;
 
(4) The Circuit Court clearly erred in FOFs 60, 61, 63,
 
64, and 66, and COLs 77 and 81-83, insofar as the court awarded
 damages because causation was not proved and/or the damages
 awarded were speculative and improper; and
 
(5) The Circuit Court erred in denying the State's 
motion for summary judgment as to claims on behalf of Briandalynne's estate because a fetus is not a "person" under Hawai
'i's wrongful death statute. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"In this jurisdiction, a trial court's FOFs are subject 
to the clearly erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the 
Emps'. Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai
'i, 106 Hawai 'i 416, 430, 
106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai
'i 445, 
453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)). "An FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. [The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has] defined 'substantial 
evidence' as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to
 
support a conclusion." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 91 Hawai 'i 
394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999) (citations, internal
 quotation marks, and brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Kotis,
 91 Hawai
'i 319, 328, 984 P.2d 78, 87 (1999)). 
A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is
freely reviewable for its correctness. [The appellate
court] ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong
standard. Thus, a COL that is supported by the trial
court's FOFs and that reflects an application of the correct
rule of law will not be overturned. However, a COL that
presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under
the clearly erroneous standard because the court's
conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances
of each individual case.

quotation marks, and brackets omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co.
 
V. Ponce, 105 Hawai 'i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004). 
"On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
 
reviewed de novo." Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & Cnty. of
 
Honolulu, 119 Hawai 'i 90, 96, 194 P.3d 531, 537 (2008) (citations 
omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 A. Wrongful Death of an Unborn, Viable Fetus
 Hawai
'i's wrongful death statute is codified in Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 663-3 (Supp. 2015) and states, in part:
 
(a) When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful
act, neglect, or default of any person, the deceased's legal
representative, or any of the persons enumerated in
subsection (b), may maintain an action against the person
causing the death or against the person responsible for the
death. The action shall be maintained on behalf of the
 persons enumerated in subsection (b), except that the legal
representative may recover on behalf of the estate the
reasonable expenses of the deceased's last illness and
burial.
 
The State argues, inter alia, that there is no legal
 
authority allowing a claim on behalf of Briandalynne's estate
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
because Briandalynne was not a "person". The Circuit Court 
rejected this argument when it granted summary judgment as to all claims against Yasunaga, Marks, Zienkiewicz, and Wakabayashi, but denied summary judgment in all other respects, including the claims brought on behalf of Briandalynne's estate. After trial, in COL 74, the court concluded that "[u]nder Hawai
'i's wrongful 
death statute, a parent of a stillborn viable fetus, such as Plaintiff herein, is entitled to sue for the wrongful death of the fetus. Wade v. U.S., 745 F. Supp. 1573, 1579 (D. Haw. 
1990)." 
The issue of whether a wrongful death claim may be 
brought on behalf of a stillborn fetus, which had been viable before death, has not been addressed previously by the Hawai
'i 
appellate courts; nor does a review of the legislative history of HRS § 663-3 reveal whether or not the Legislature intended the statute to apply to unborn children.
5 It appears, however, that 
only six states – California, Florida, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, and New York – prohibit wrongful death claims from being brought on behalf of unborn children.
6 On the other hand, forty-one 
5
 The United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i has 
interpreted Hawai' i's wrongful death statute as allowing the parents of a
stillborn viable fetus to sue for its wrongful death. Wade v. U.S., 745 F. 
Supp. 1573 (D. Haw. 1990). While the state courts are the final arbiters of 
state law, the interpretations of federal courts can be persuasive. See, 
e.g., AlohaCare v. Ito, 126 Hawai' i 326, 349 n.40, 271 P.3d 621, 644 n.40
(2012), Rana v. Bishop Ins. of Haw., Inc., 6 Haw. App. 1, 10, 713 P.2d 1363,1369 (1985).

Miller, 348 So.2d 303 (Fla. 1977); Dunn v. Rose Way, Inc., 333 N.W.2d 830
(Iowa 1983) (although a wrongful death recovery on behalf of a viable, unborn
child was not allowed because such a child was not a "person," it was a "minor
child" so that its parents could recover for loss of services of a minor
child); Shaw v. Jendzejec, 717 A.2d 367 (Me. 1998); Giardina v. Bennett, 545

states and the District of Columbia permit wrongful death actions
 
to be brought on behalf of unborn, viable fetuses.7 Of these,

 a claim by statute.

and as used in medical parlance, refers to the stage of prenatal
development at which a fetus would be capable of independent
existence if removed from its mother's womb, and it has often been
noted that a fetus ordinarily becomes viable during the sixth or
seventh month of its mother's pregnancy.

overwhelming majority.
 
We first address the State's argument that it would be 
inconsistent to accept a fetus as a "person" for the purposes of 
the wrongful death statute when the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held in 
State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawai 'i 115, 123 P.3d 1210 (2005), that a 
fetus is not a "person" as defined in the Hawai 'i Penal Code. In 
Aiwohi, the defendant admitted to using crystal methamphetamine while she was pregnant. Id. at 117, 123 P.3d at 1212. Her child 
was born alive, but died two days later. Id. at 115-16, 123 P.3d 
at 1210-11. An autopsy revealed that the death was caused by methamphetamine. Id. The defendant was charged and convicted 
with the crime of manslaughter as defined in HRS § 707-702(1)(a) (1993). Id. at 117, 123 P.3d at 1212. The supreme court 
concluded that to be guilty of manslaughter, the defendant's conduct must have been directed against a "person". Id. at 128, 
123 P.3d at 1223. HRS § 707-700 (1993), which defines the terms used in Part I of the Hawai
'i Penal Code, defines "person" as "a 
human being who has been born and is alive." As the court

The states that have not yet decided this issue are Colorado,
Hawai'i, and Wyoming. Federal courts, however, have interpreted the laws of
Alaska, Colorado, and Hawai' i to permit such a cause of action. See Espadero
v. Feld, 649 F. Supp. 1480 (D. Colo. 1986); Wade v. U.S., 745 F. Supp. 1573
(D. Haw. 1990).

stated, "a fetus is clearly not one 'who has been born and is 
alive.'" Aiwohi, 109 Hawai 'i at 129, 123 P.3d at 1224. 
Additionally, the court noted: 
Even if, arguendo, the statutory language were
perceived to be ambiguous, the term "person" may not be
construed so as to include fetuses. Where statutory
language is ambiguous, HRS § 1–15 (1993) directs this court
to look to "[t]he reason and spirit of the law, and the
cause which induced the legislature to enact it. . . ." HRS
 § 1–15. In the present case, there is nothing in the
legislative history indicating that the legislature intended
to include fetuses within the definition of the term
 "person." In the absence of clear statutory language, and
with no legislative guidance vis-á-vis legislative history,
the applicable doctrine is the rule of lenity. See State v.
 
Shimabukuro
, 100 Hawai' i 324, 327, 60 P.3d 274, 277 (2002)
(stating that "[w]here a criminal statute is ambiguous, it
is to be interpreted according to the rule of lenity");
State v. Kaakimaka, 84 Hawai' i 280, 292, 933 P.2d 617, 629
(1997) (stating that "[a]mbiguity concerning the ambit of
criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity")
(citations omitted). Consequently, even if the language were
viewed as ambiguous, the statute would still have to be
strictly construed in favor of [defendant] and against the
prosecution.
 
Id. 
In State v. Jardine, 101 Hawai 'i 3, 61 P.3d 514 (App. 
2002), the Intermediate Court of Appeals similarly declined to
 
recognize an unborn child as a "person" or "another" for purposes
 of the choice of evils defense or the defense of "use of force
 for the protection of other persons", writing "[s]ince Hawai
'i 
has not legislatively included unborn children within the
 definitions of 'another' or 'person' for purposes of the Hawai
'i 
Penal code, we decline to do so." Id.
 at 9-10, 61 P.3d at 520-21
 
(footnote omitted). 
The State contends that it would conflict with the
 
statutory interpretation of the penal code to hold that a fetus
 can be a "person" for the purposes of the wrongful death statute.It also argues that "it would be inconsistent to allow a civil
  
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claim to be prosecuted against the State for the death of
 
Appellee's fetus when Appellee could not be prosecuted for the
 harm she herself did to her fetus."
 
This argument is unconvincing. First, although not
 
dispositive, we note that Hawai
'i is one of only nine states that 
still apply the "born alive" rule and have not amended their
 criminal homicide statutes to include unborn children as
 victims.
9 Of those nine states, seven allow a cause of action
 
for the wrongful death of an unborn, viable fetus.10 Only one,
 
New Jersey, specifically bars such a cause of action, while
 another, Colorado, is undecided.
11 Thus, the existence of the
 
"born alive" rule in a state's penal code clearly does not
 
9 Besides Hawai' i, these states include Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont. See 
Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-3-101 (Westlaw 2015); 11 Del. Code Ann. 11, § 222
(Westlaw 2015); Or. Rev. Stat. § 163.005 (Westlaw 2015); State v. Courchesne,998 A.2d 1 (Conn. 2010); State v. Lamy, 969 A.2d 451 (N.H. 2009); State exrel. A.W.S., 440 A.2d 1144 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1981); State v. Willis,652 P.2d 1222 (N.M. Ct. App. 1982); State v. Oliver, 563 A.2d 1002 (Vt. 1989).
The remaining jurisdictions have either defined a "person" to
include a fetus for purposes of homicide, see, e.g., Ala. Code 1975 § 13A-6-1
(2004) (The term "person," when referring to the victim of a criminal homicide
or assault, includes an unborn child at any stage of development); Com. v.
Cass, 467 N.E.2d 1324 (Mass. 1984) (rejecting the common law "born alive" rule
and holding that viable fetuses can be victims of homicide); Tex. Penal Code
Ann. § 1.07(a)(26)&(38) (Westlaw 2015) (in the penal code, a "person" is an
individual, corporation, or association, and an "individual" includes an
unborn child at every stage of gestation); have added statutes specifically
making it a form of homicide to kill an unborn child in certain circumstances,
see, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. § 16-5-80 (Westlaw 2015) (defining the crimes of
"feticide" and "voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child"); 18 Pa.Stat. Ann.
§§ 2603-2605 (creating the offense of "Criminal homicide of unborn child");
R.I. Gen. Laws Ann. § 11-23-5 (Westlaw 2015) (the willful killing of an unborn
quick child is manslaughter); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-1083 (Westlaw 2015)
(creating the offense of "Death or injury of child in utero due to commission
of violent crime"); or have not decided the issue. Specifically, the District
of Columbia, Maine, and Wyoming do not have statutes defining a "person" as
one who has been born alive and a review of the case law does not reveal
 whether they would consider a fetus to be a victim of homicide.

 These states are Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. See supra note 9.

 See supra note 9.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclose the existence of a cause of action for the wrongful
 
death of a viable fetus.
 
Second, a review of the case law from other
 
jurisdictions provides compelling justification for this
 coexistence. When presented with the argument that the existence
 of a cause of action for the death of an unborn fetus is
 inconsistent with the "born alive" rule, courts often rely on the
 well-established principle that, while civil causes of action are
 remedial in nature and therefore are generally construed
 liberally, criminal statutes are construed strictly and in favor
 of the accused. See, e.g., State v. Amaro, 448 A.2d 1257, 1258­
60 (R.I. 1982) (holding that a fetus is not a person under the
 vehicular homicide statute even though a fetus could be a person
 in a wrongful death cause of action and even though the
 legislature made it a crime to intentionally kill an unborn,
 quick child. The vehicular homicide statute is penal in nature
 and must be narrowly construed); State v. Oliver, 563 A.2d 1002,
 1004 (Vt. 1989) ("The wrongful death statute is remedial in
 nature, being designed to allay the harsh common law rule denying
 liability due to the death of the victim, and must therefore be
 construed liberally. Penal statutes, on the other hand, are to
 be strictly construed in a manner favorable to the accused.")
 (citations omitted); State v. Dunn, 916 P.2d 952, 955 (Wash. Ct.
 App. 1996) ("Unlike the wrongful death statute, which is remedial
 in nature and interpreted liberally as a result, a criminal
 statute must be given a literal and strict interpretation. If a
 criminal statute is ambiguous . . . the rule of lenity requires
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
us to adopt an interpretation most favorable to the criminal
 
defendant.") (citations omitted); see also State v. Trudell, 755
 P.2d 511, 512 (Kan. 1988) ("Whereas a tort statute may be
 construed liberally in order to give effect to its remedial
 purpose, a criminal statute, with its punitive effect, must be
 strictly construed against the State and in favor of the
 accused."), superseded by statute, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21-5419
 (Westlaw 2015); State v. Soto, 378 N.W.2d 625, 630 (Minn. 1985)
 ("It does not follow that because we held in Verkennes that next
 of kin might recover damages arising out of the destruction of a
 viable fetus in a civil action . . . , that a viable fetus is a
 'human being' for purposes of the criminal law."), superseded by
 statute, Minn. Stat. Ann. § 609.2665 (Westlaw 2015); State ex
 rel. Atkinson v. Wilson, 332 S.E.2d 807, 810-12 (W.Va. 1984)
 (holding that the murder statute did not authorize prosecution
 for killing a viable unborn child, even though a wrongful death
 cause of action could exist, because the wrongful death act is a
 remedial statute which is construed liberally whereas the
 legislature, not the courts, have the primary power to create and
 define crimes and penalties), superseded by statute, W. Va. Code
 Ann. § 61-2-30 (Westlaw 2015). But see Justus v. Atchison, 565
 
P.2d 122, 132 (Cal. 1977) ("But we do not join those courts which
 have equated fetus with person simply because the wrongful death
 statute is 'remedial' and must be 'liberally' construed."); Stern
 v. Miller, 348 So.2d 303, 308 (Fla. 1977) ("We recognize that the
 new Wrongful Death Act is remedial in nature and is to be
 construed liberally. However, we cannot construe the statutory
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provisions so 'liberally' as to reach a result contrary to the
 
clear intent of the legislature.") 
Pursuant to Hawai 'i precedent, remedial statutes are to 
be liberally interpreted. Kalima v. State, 111 Hawai 'i 84, 100, 
137 P.3d 990, 1006 (2006). "Generally, remedial statutes are those which provide a remedy, or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Inasmuch as "[t]he purpose of damages in wrongful death and survival statutes is compensation for loss, not punishment," and HRS § 663-3 creates a statutory right for non-dependent relatives to sue for wrongful death, a right which did not exist under common law, we conclude that this statute is remedial in nature. Greene v. Texeira, 54 Haw. 231, 505 P.2d 1169, 1170 (1973) (as quoted); see also Estate of Coates v. Pac. Eng'g, a Div. of Pac. Lining Co., Inc., 71 Haw. 358, 364, 791 P.2d 1257, 1260 (1990) (regarding the common law tort). By contrast, the statute in Aiwohi, which defined the word "person," was construed strictly and with lenience towards the defendant because it was a penal statute. Aiwohi, 109 Hawai
'i at 129, 123 P.3d at 1224. Further, 
the penal code itself makes clear that its definitions are to apply to the chapter of the penal code relating to offenses against the person; there is nothing to indicate that it has any application to civil tort statutes. HRS § 707-700. 
We also note that various Hawai
'i statutes use 
different definitions of the word "person." See, e.g., HRS 
§ 431:1-212 (2005) (a person as defined in the insurance code 
20
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
includes companies, businesses, corporations, etc.); HRS § 554G-2
 
(Supp. 2015) (a person as defined in the Permitted Transfers in
 Trust Act includes only natural persons), HRS § 651-91(1)(4)
 (1993) (as used in HRS §§ 651-92 to 651-96 (1993), a person means
 any individual under sixty-five years of age other than the head
 of a family). Thus, we reject the State's argument that it would
 be irreconcilably inconsistent to define a person differently
 under the wrongful death statute and the penal code. 
Next, we find compelling reasons to include unborn,
 
viable fetuses as persons under the wrongful death statute. We
 adopt the persuasive rationale of the Vermont Supreme Court,
 which wrote:
 
Numerous reasons have been assigned by the several
jurisdictions for reaching the conclusion to which we
subscribe. The ones commonly given, and in our view
convincing, are summarized in White v. Yup, 85 Nev. 527,
536, 458 P.2d 617, 622 (1969) as follows:
 
A. If a child, injured when a viable fetus as a result of
another's negligence, has a cause of action when born, then
it can make no difference in liability whether death occurs
just prior to or just after birth.
 
B. A viable unborn child is, in fact, biologically speaking,
a presently existing person and a living human being,
because it has reached such a state of development that it
can presently live outside the female body, as well as
within it.
 
C. If no right of action is allowed, there is a wrong
inflicted for which there is no remedy. Where negligent acts
produce a stillbirth and a right of action is denied, an
incongruous result is produced. For example, if a doctor
acted negligently while delivering a baby and it died, the
doctor would be immune from lawsuit. However, if he badly
injured the child, the doctor would be exposed to liability.
Under such a rule, there is the absurd result that the
greater the harm, the better the chance of immunity, and the
tort-feasor could foreclose his own liability. (Citations
omitted in each instance).
 
Vaillancourt v. Med. Ctr. Hosp. of Vt., Inc., 425 A.2d 92, 94-95
 
(Vt. 1980). See also 19 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 107 § 7
 
(2015) ("A reading of the opinions of the majority states makes
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clear that the reasons supporting the recognition of an action
 
for the wrongful death of a viable unborn child center on the
 distinct, independent nature of the unborn at viability; a viable
 unborn child is a 'person' or 'individual.' Further, the
 majority jurisdictions clearly express the remedial nature and
 purposes of the wrongful death remedy, and the injustice in
 allowing a tortfeasor to escape liability by inflicting greater
 harm.") 
In addition, in Hawai
'i, a child who is subsequently 
born alive may recover damages for negligently inflicted prenatal injuries. Omori v. Jowa Haw. Co., Ltd., 91 Hawai
'i 157, 161-62, 
981 P.2d 714, 718-19 (App. 1999), aff'd as modified, 91 Hawai 'i 
146, 981 P.2d 703 (1999). Thus, as observed in Vaillancourt, it should make no difference to the tortfeasor's liability whether the injuries result in death just prior to or just after birth. Further, as the majority of courts considering the issue recognize, to allow a cause of action in a case where an unborn child is injured but survives, while foreclosing a cause of action where the unborn child dies before birth, would lead to the absurd and illogical result that greater harm results in a better chance of immunity. See Wade, 745 F. Supp. at 1578-79, 
Vaillancourt, 425 A.2d at 94-95; Baldwin v. Butcher, 184 S.E.2d 428, 435 (W.Va. 1971); Kwaterski v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 148 N.W.2d 107, 110 (Wis. 1967). Construing the wrongful death statute to recognize a cause of action on behalf of an unborn viable fetus avoids this absurd result. Further, it advances the statute's remedial purpose without contradicting any 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
legislative intent. See Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 
Hawai'i 54, 68-69, 905 P.2d 29, 43-44 (1995) (holding that real 
estate or residences would qualify as "personal investments" as 
the term was used in the antitrust statute where the statute was remedial in nature and there was nothing in the legislative history that evidenced an intent to preclude real estate or residences from the definition of an "investment"); see also Shapiro, supra note 7, at § 2(a) ("In the absence of legislative history expressly indicating otherwise, it appears reasonable to assume that when wrongful death statutes have been enacted, legislators have generally given no thought to whether deaths of unborn children were intended to be included or excluded, and it is thus inappropriate to regard the issue as simply one of legislative intent.") (footnote omitted). 
We also agree with the United States District Court for 
the District of Hawai
'i which wrote in Wade v. U.S.: 
The majority position, allowing a cause of action for the
wrongful death of a viable fetus who could have sustained
life outside the womb, represents the more logical and
thoughtful holding. . . . This conclusion comports with
principles of fairness and justice in light of the fact that
a live-born child may sue for injuries suffered as a fetus.
To deny a wrongful death action in the event that the injury
kills the fetus makes little sense. Such a denial would
 only immunize the more severe tort and would allow the
tortfeasor to eliminate his own liability by increasing
rather than by mitigating the impact of his wrongs. To
 avoid such an anomaly, [we] construe[] the Hawaii wrongful
death statute to allow parents of a stillborn viable fetus
to sue for its wrongful death.
 
745 F. Supp. at 1579.
 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thus, we hold that a claim may be brought pursuant to
 
HRS § 663-3 for the death of a viable, unborn fetus.12
 
B. Briandalynne's Viability
 
The Circuit Court found, in FOF 41, that "during the
 
approximately three-week period in July 2007, of Plaintiff's
 vaginal bleeding and Plaintiff's reports to OCCC staff of such
 bleeding, the baby was viable." The State argues that even if a
 cause of action is recognized for the wrongful death of a viable
 fetus, there is no evidence in the present case that Briandalynne
 was viable. This argument is without merit.
 
As noted above, viability refers to the ability of the
 
fetus to survive outside its mother's womb. See supra, note 7. 
Here, the State's expert witness, Dr. Hirata, agreed that
 Briandalynne was viable during the entire period of Castro's
 bleeding up until July 29, 2007, and could have been delivered
 alive. Additionally, Dr. Killeen reported that upon examination,
 Castro's placenta appeared to be that of a term or near-term
 pregnancy. Dr. Killeen approximated that Briandalynne's
 gestational age was between thirty-five to thirty-seven weeks. 
Dr. Hariton testified that, "[i]f you can get a woman to 34 weeks
 . . . once they get to 34 weeks, I would be very happy. I would
 deliver them because the chances of the baby doing well in the
 nursery is good after 34 weeks." Earlier in his testimony, Dr.
 Hariton also indicated that a baby would be able to survive
 
12
 We need not address whether a claim for relief can be granted on
behalf of a non-viable fetus because, as discussed below, we do not disturb
the Circuit Court's finding that Briandalynne was viable at the time of her
death.
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
outside its mother's womb at thirty-three weeks of gestation. 
Thus, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support
 the court's finding that Briandalynne was viable. Accordingly,
 we also conclude that the Circuit Court did not err by denying
 summary judgment on the claims brought on behalf of
 Briandalynne's estate for wrongful death.
 
C. The State's Negligence
 1. Duty and Breach
 
The Circuit Court's FOFs regarding DPS and OCCC
 
policies for the health care of segregated inmates include the
 following:
 
12. During the approximately one-month period, from the
time Plaintiff returned to OCCC from FDC on June 29, 2007,
until Plaintiff's transfer to WCCC on August 2, 2007,
Plaintiff's custodial status was that of "Administrative
 Segregation" or "lockdown." Plaintiff, like other inmates
who were placed on administrative segregation, was locked up
23 hours a day, in one of the three designated "lockdown" or
"segregation" cells in OCCC Module 20 (where women inmates
were housed), and Plaintiff was segregated from and
prohibited from having any contact with the general
population of women inmates in Module 20. Inmates in the
 lockdown or segregation cells, were only permitted to have
contact with the Adult Corrections Officers (ACOs). 
13. DPS Policy No. COR.10D.02, Policy 4.3(a), requires
health care staff to "make daily unscheduled rounds of all
segregation units," and explicitly mandates that, "Each
inmate in the segregation unit shall be observed by the
health care staff and questioned about health problems. . .
."
 
14. OCCC Policy No. 7.10D.21, Policy 4.2, requires that
"Inmates in segregation shall be seen daily by health care
staff."
 
15. OCCC nurse supervisors Roberta Marks and Keith
Wakabayashi testified that the OCCC nurses were not required
to follow the health care policies and procedures for
segregated inmates supra for female inmates, because these
policies only applied to male inmates held in a separate,
stand-alone segregation holding unit. The OCCC nurse
 supervisors did not consider the three isolation cells in
the women's module, Module 20, as "segregation."
 
16. The conditions of Plaintiff's confinement adduced at
 
trial supra, and as described in the actual July 13, 2007
"Administrative Segregation" Order (imposing the
disciplinary segregation penalty to Plaintiff by the OCCC
 
25
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Warden), constituted "segregation" as that term is defined
in OCCC's Policy No. 7.10D.21, "Health Evaluations of
Inmates in Segregation." This OCCC segregated inmate health
policy, by its own language, referred and applied to both
male and female inmates.
 
17. Because Plaintiff was held in such segregated status,
the DPS and OCCC policies supra, requiring health care staff
to conduct daily visits to observe and question segregated
inmates about their health status, applied to Plaintiff.
These mandatory daily health care status visits and
inquiries, however, were not conducted for Plaintiff, during
the relevant time period.
 
. . . .
 28. During Plaintiff's entire stay at OCCC, Plaintiff was
on segregation status, from July 2 to August 2, 2007. The
 
pertinent DPS and OCCC Policies and Procedures for medical
care for segregated inmates mentioned supra, were not
followed, and no medical staffer ever checked on, or
communicated with Plaintiff, about her bleeding complaints.
Nor was Plaintiff ever brought to the OCCC Medical Unit for
evaluation of her complaints.
 
29. Although DPS Policy supra, required completion of
diagnostic testing and other specialty services in a timely
manner, this policy was also not followed, where Ms.
Yasunaga's orders for the ultrasound and OBGYN evaluation,
remained unfulfilled for a month, and ultimately were never
done.
 
(Footnotes omitted).
 
The State challenges FOFs 12, 15-17, 28, and 29, to the
 
extent that the Circuit Court found that the State did not follow
 
DPS and OCCC policies for medical care of segregated inmates with
 respect to Castro. Specifically, the State argues:
 
While OCCC has a policy that requires that inmates in
segregation are to be seen daily by health care staff, the
only evidence presented in this case was that this policy
applies only to the men's segregation holding unit and not
the lockdown cells in the modules. . . .
 
[FOF 17] is wrong as there is no evidence to support
it. Both Wakabayashi and Marks testified that the
segregation policy does not apply to the lockdown cells;
rather the policy applies to the segregation unit at OCCC.
Appellee did not present any evidence to refute this
evidence.
 
We reject the State's argument that the medical care
 
policy applies only to the men's segregation holding unit. DPS
 
Policy No. COR.10D.06: Sick Call, introduced as Plaintiff's
 
26
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Exhibit 12 and referenced in the FOFs above, does not specify
 
that it pertains only to the men's unit, but states: "This policy
 and procedure applies to all branch facilities and their assigned
 personnel." OCCC Policy No. 7.10D.21: Health Evaluation of
 Inmates in Segregation, which was introduced as Plaintiff's
 Exhibit 10 and referenced in the FOFs quoted above, defines
 "Segregation" as "All forms of inmate segregation from the
 general population for various reasons such as administrative
 segregation, disciplinary segregation, protective custody, and
 pre-trial hearing." It also states that, "[i]f health care staff
 detect a serious deterioration of a health condition while the
 inmate is in a disciplinary or other segregation unit, he/she
 
shall be removed until the condition is stabilized." (Emphasis
 
added). The evidence adduced at trial indicates that when Castro
 returned to OCCC from the FDC, she was put in administrative
 segregation from at least July 6, 2007 to August 2, 2007, when
 she was transferred to WCCC. Castro testified that the
 
segregation cell she was put in was also known as a lockdown
 
cell. OCCC ACO Sonja Ma'ae agreed that the terms "segregation"
 and "lockdown" were used interchangeably. OCCC ACO Venus Kakiva
 
testified that the lockdown cells in the women's module were used
 
for "disciplinary, LD, administration, segregation, suicide
 watch, . . . or therapeutic lockdown." Thus, there was
 substantial evidence that the referenced DPS and OCCC policies
 applied to Castro while she was in "segregation" or "lockdown" at
 OCCC.
 
27
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We acknowledge that Marks, the nurse manager at the
 
OCCC, testified that the OCCC Policy No. 7.10D.21 applied only to
 
the men's side of the facility because to her knowledge, the
 women's side was never designated as a segregation area by the
 warden. Marks also said that the NCCHC (the National Commission
 on Corrections Health Care) had confirmed to her that the women's
 side was not a segregation unit. Wakabayashi, the clinical
 administrator at the OCCC, also testified that the sick call
 policy did not apply to the female module, agreeing with the
 following statement: "So because you call the three segregation
 or lockdown units in the women's module only as 'lockdown,' you
 do not apply any of the segregation health rules to the women's
 side; is that correct?" 
Nonetheless, it is well-settled that
 
In cases of conflicting evidence, the credibility of
the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are
within the province of the trial court and, generally, will
not be disturbed on appeal. It is not the function of
 appellate courts to second-guess the trier of fact where
there is substantial evidence in the record to support its
conclusion. 
Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc., 111 Hawai 'i 286, 
296-97, 141 P.3d 459, 469-70 (2006) (citations omitted, block 
quote format altered). Here, the decision to weigh the conflicting evidence in Castro's favor was within the province of the Circuit Court and its decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Thus, we will not disturb the court's findings in FOFs 12, 15-17, 28, and 29, that the aforementioned DPS and OCCC policies applied to Castro. 
The State also argues that it "substantially complied
 
with the [OCCC] policy as a nurse did see Appellee in her cell
 
28
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
most of the days in July and Appellee was in the health unit
 
three different times." The State suggests that Castro could
 have made complaints to the medication nurse, the staff in the
 medical unit, or the sick call nurse. However, the court's
 finding was not that the State did not "substantially comply"
 with the policy, but that "pertinent DPS and OCCC Policies and
 Procedures for medical care for segregated inmates . . . were not
 
13
followed."  (Emphasis added.) Further, whether or not Castro
 
had the opportunity to make complaints to medical staff is not
 dispositive of whether the State complied with the DPS and OCCC
 policies which stated that "[i]nmate[s] in segregation shall be
 
seen daily by health care staff" and "[e]ach inmate in
 segregation shall be checked by the sick call nurse and
 documented in sick call log." (Emphasis added.)
 
For these reasons, we reject the State's arguments that
 
FOFs 12, 15-17, 28, and 29 are clearly erroneous.
 
The State also challenges FOFs 23-25, 27, 31, and 
41-47, insofar as they relate to the State's negligence. 
13 Additionally, it does not appear that the State "substantially
complied" with the pertinent policies. The nurse to whom the State refers
 
appears to be the nurse who delivered Castro's medication while she was in
lockdown. Castro's uncontroverted testimony was that the nurse did not even
have to speak with her when delivering her medications. Further, the evidence
indicates that a nurse only visited Castro to deliver medications from July 3­6, and 12-31, 2007. Castro's visits to the medical unit in July, which the
State also referenced, were apparently for mental health issues and
psychiatric medication, and not prenatal care. Further, the evidence adduced
at trial was that a sick call nurse did not see the female inmates in lockdown
 every day, but would have to be notified by an ACO to see an inmate in a
lockdown cell or sometimes, the sick call nurse would see the inmate "calling
out" to the nurse. Thus, even if Castro was visited by a nurse who delivered
medication most days in July and was in the medical unit three times, and
possibly had the ability to "call out" to a sick call nurse, this would not
appear to "substantially comply" with OCCC Policy No. 7.10D.21 which says
"Inmates in segregation shall be seen daily by health care staff," and "Each
inmate in segregation shall be checked by the sick call nurse and documented
in sick call log."

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Although arguing that "Appellee's evidence to support these
 
findings is not sufficient and was rebutted by the State," the
 State addresses only FOFs 23, 27, 31, and 41.
 
FOF 23 states: "Within several days of Plaintiff's 
July 2, 2007 pre-natal visit with Ms. Yasunaga, Plaintiff began experiencing vaginal bleeding. Plaintiff made four to five reports of her vaginal bleeding to various ACOs, including ACO Hattie Reis, ACO Wanda Nunes, and ACO Reyetta Ofilas." The State does not dispute that Castro reported her bleeding to Ofilas, but disputes the court's characterization of the reports to the other two ACOs. Without citing to the record, the State claims that "Nunes was clear that Appellee's complaint was that she was spotting." However, a review of Nunes's testimony clearly reveals that by "spotting" she meant bleeding from the vaginal area.
14 As to Reis, the State argues that Reis's testimony was 
not credible because she had built a friendship with Castro, and apparently argues that because Reis did not know the dates of the complaints and did not log them, it would be error to find that such complaints were made. As stated above, it is well-settled that the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence is within the province of the trial court and such determinations are generally not disturbed on appeal. Stanford 
Carr Dev. Corp., 111 Hawai
'i at 296-97, 141 P.3d at 469-70. 
14
 The State also avers that: "As to ACO Nunes, she testified that
she does not know if she called medical or not." This appears to challenge
FOF 24, which states: "All three ACOs informed the OCCC medical unit of
 Plaintiff's vaginal bleeding and requested medical attention, but no medical
care was provided." However, Castro's testimony was that she received a reply
from Nunes, which she understood to come from the medical unit. Thus, we
decline to hold that FOF 24 was clearly erroneous as evidence supported the
finding that Nunes reported Castro's complaint to medical personnel.
 
30
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Further, the fact that Reis did not recall the dates of the
 
complaints and did not log them would not render the court's
 finding erroneous, especially where Reis reported that Castro
 complained to her about bleeding three times and Castro also
 testified that she complained to Reis at least three times. 
Therefore, we reject the State's argument that FOF 23 is clearly
 erroneous.
 
The State also challenges FOF 27, which states: "Up
 
until Plaintiff's transfer out of OCCC on August 2, 2007,
 Plaintiff did not receive any medical care for her four to five
 complaints of vaginal bleeding, and was never sent to the OCCC
 Medical Unit." The State argues that this finding is erroneous
 because Castro was in the medical unit three times in July. As
 stated above, Castro was in the medical unit at least three times
 in July because of mental health issues. In context, FOF 27 is a
 finding that Castro was never sent to the medical unit in
 response to her vaginal bleeding complaints. The State points to
 no evidence to the contrary. This finding is not clearly
 erroneous.
 
The State challenges FOF 31 to the extent that it finds
 
that when Castro arrived at WCCC on August 2, 2007, her fetus was
 no longer kicking. We agree that the record does not reflect the
 date on which Castro stopped feeling kicking and, in fact, it
 appears that the date was later than August 2, 2007.
15 However,
 
the State has not explained how this error would affect its
 
15
 Castro's testimony appeared to indicate that the kicking stopped a
few days after she arrived at WCCC. 
31
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
substantial rights. "No judgment, order, or decree shall be
 
reversed, amended, or modified for any error or defect, unless
 the court is of the opinion that it has injuriously affected the
 substantial rights of the appellant." HRS § 641-2 (Supp. 2015). 
It is undisputed that the baby stopped moving after the bleeding
 episodes, that on August 10, 2007, Castro reported to Amberg that
 she had not felt any movement for three to four days, and that on
 August 11, 2007, Briandalynne was stillborn. As it does not
 appear that the court's erroneous finding that the baby stopped
 moving as of August 2, 2007, as opposed to days later, would
 substantially affect the State's rights or the court's judgment,
 we decline to vacate the Circuit Court's decision based on this
 erroneous finding. "Erroneous findings of fact that are
 unnecessary to support the decision and judgment of the trial
 court are not grounds for reversal." Wright v. Wright, 1 Haw.
 
App. 581, 585, 623 P.2d 97, 100 (1981) (citation omitted). 
Finally, the State challenges FOF 41, which finds:
 
"[D]uring the approximately three-week period in July 2007, of
 Plaintiff's vaginal bleeding and Plaintiff's reports to OCCC
 staff of such bleeding, the baby was viable." The finding that
 Castro was bleeding for approximately three weeks is supported by
 her testimony that she began bleeding within the first week or
 two of July, and then stopped right before she was transferred to
 the WCCC, which was August 2, 2007. And, as we noted above, the
 finding regarding viability was supported by substantial
 evidence, including the State's own expert, Dr. Hirata, who
 
32
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreed that "during the entire period of Miss Castro's bleeding,
 
and up until July 29th, the baby was viable[.]" 
The State makes no argument as to how the remaining
 
challenged FOFs are clearly erroneous. 
Thus, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court erred
 
in finding that the State breached its duty to Castro. 
2. Causation
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has long held, in the context 
of negligence actions:
 
The best definition and the most workable test of
 
proximate or legal cause so far suggested seems to be
this: "The actor's negligent conduct is a legal cause
of harm to another if (a) his [or her] conduct is a
substantial factor in bringing about the harm, and (b)
there is no rule of law relieving the actor from
liability because of the manner in which his [or her]
negligence has resulted in the harm." Restatement,
Torts, § 431; Prosser on Torts, § 47.
 
Mitchell v. Branch, 45 Haw. 128, 132, 363 P.2d 969, 973(1961); see also Aga v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai' i 230, 236, 891
P.2d 1022, 1028 (1995) (quoting the Mitchell test withapproval). Under the Mitchell test, a 
defendant's negligence need not have been the whole
cause or the only factor in bringing about the harm.
It was enough that his [or her] negligence was a
substantial factor in causing plaintiff's injuries.
 
Knodle, 69 Haw. at 390, 742 P.2d at 386 (citation, internal
quotation marks, and brackets omitted) (emphases added).
 
As this court explained in McKenna v. Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft, 57 Haw. 460, 558 P.2d 1018 (1977):
 
Th[e Mitchell] test represents a realistic approach to
problems of causation, an area which has long been
complicated by a failure to distinguish between
questions of fact and policy concerns. The first arm
of the test contemplates a factual determination that
the negligence of the defendant was more likely than
not a substantial factor in bringing about the result
complained of. See Prosser on Torts § 41 (4th ed.
1971). . . .
 
The second arm of the Mitchell test contemplates
inquiry whether there are policy concerns or rules of
law that would prevent imposition of liability on the
negligent party although his negligence was clearly a
cause of the resultant injury. . . . 
33
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 464-65, 558 P.2d at 1022 (emphases added). Moreover,
"[w]here there is conflicting evidence, as there is in this
record, on the issue of proximate causation, the question is
one for the trier of fact." Mitchell, 45 Haw. at 139, 363
P.2d at 977 (citations omitted).
 
Taylor-Rice v. State, 91 Hawai 'i 60, 74-75, 979 P.2d 1086, 1100­
01 (1999). 
In the present case, the State argues that the alleged
 
lack of medical care was not a substantial factor in bringing
 
about Briandalynne's death and challenges the Circuit Court's
 findings, in FOFs 48-50, that the State's negligence was the
 legal cause of her death. These FOFs state:
 
48. Had Plaintiff's medical care been consistent with the
 
applicable standard of care, Plaintiff's bleeding condition
would have been detected and treated; or if the bleeding
condition could not have been corrected, delivery would have
been initiated and Plaintiff's baby would have been born
alive.
 
49. Given the undisputed earliest date of death of July 29,
2007 from Dr. Killeen, Plaintiff's baby could have been
delivered alive, on or before that date. Had medical care
 for Plaintiff and her baby been provided consistent with the
applicable standard of care after July 2, 2007 and before
July 29, 2007, delivery of a live baby would have been
accomplished.
 
50. Therefore, Defendant State's negligence was the legal
cause of the death of Plaintiff's baby, and Plaintiff's
injuries and damages. 
In large part, the State argues that the court erred by
 
affording greater weight to the opinions of Dr. Killeen and Dr.
 
Hariton, rather than that of Dr. Hirata. We again decline to
 disturb the Circuit Court's determinations as to the credibility
 of these witnesses and weight of the evidence. See Stanford Carr
 
Dev. Corp.
, 111 Hawai 'i at 296-97, 141 P.3d at 469-70. Here, we 
find substantial evidence to support the court's FOFs.
 Dr. Hariton was qualified as an expert in obstetrics
 
and gynecology. His opinion was that Castro's prenatal care was
 
"totally inadequate and below the standard of care." He opined
 
34
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that if the tests and ultrasound that were ordered for Castro on
 
July 2nd had been completed, "Ms. Castro would have been treated
 as a high risk pregnancy and would have a successful delivery." 
He testified that, "within a reasonable degree of probability,"
 the cause of death was placental insufficiency and the cause of
 the insufficiency was placental separation. He also agreed that
 "[i]f the medical unit [at OCCC] had responded to at least one of
 the complaints of bleeding that came from them through the guard,
 . . . this baby could have been saved." 
Dr. Killeen was qualified as an expert in pathology and
 
he performed Briandalynne's autopsy. Although he could not find
 a specific cause of death, he testified that "the more likely
 situation is that that death was related to an abruption." Dr.
 Killeen testified that "it was most likely that the fetus had
 been dead at least 96 hours, very likely one week but very likely
 less than two weeks at the time from fetal death to delivery." 
One week prior to delivery would have been August 4, 2007, while
 two weeks prior would have been July 29, 2007. Additionally,
 although he was called as the State's expert, Dr. Hirata agreed
 that up until July 29th, the baby was viable and could have
 delivered alive. 
The State also argues that the alleged lack of medical
 
care cannot be a substantial factor in this case "because the
 cause of the death of the fetus is not known." However, the
 State cites to no authority in support of its argument that the
 cause of death must be certain to prove that a party's negligence
 was a "substantial factor" in bringing it about. In fact, in
 
35
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kaho'ohanohano v. Dept. of Human Servs., 117 Hawai 'i 262, 306, 178 
P.3d 538, 582 (2008), the supreme court upheld a finding that the 
State Department of Human Services's (DHS's) actions were the 
proximate cause of a minor's injury even though the perpetrator 
who injured the minor was never identified. Although the perpetrator was unknown, "the trial court stated, 'had DHS taken custody away from [Minor's mother], required supervised visits, or had a more strict service agreement, it is highly likely Minor would not have been injured.'" Id. (brackets omitted). The 
supreme court held that the "the trial court correctly concluded that DHS's conduct legally caused [Minor's injuries]." Id. 
Similarly, here, the court made sufficient findings to support its conclusion that the State legally caused Briandalynne's death. It found that, had the State observed the applicable standards of care, Briandalynne would have been born alive. The Circuit Court's findings were supported by substantial evidence. 
In addition, the court made a finding regarding the 
cause of Briandalynne's death. FOF 37 states, in part: "Dr. Killeen's autopsy findings and conclusions indicated, inter alia, . . . the cause of Baby Castro's death appeared to be related to 'intrauterine events occurring at the time of vaginal bleeding', and that, more likely than not, death was related to a placental abruption." In proving legal causation, "the plaintiff may solicit opinions from medical experts, but such medical opinions 'must be grounded upon a reasonable medical probability as opposed to a mere possibility because possibilities are endless in the field of medicine.'" Miyamoto v. Lum, 104 Hawai
'i 1, 15­
36
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
16, 84 P.3d 509, 523-24 (2004) (quoting Craft v. Peebles, 78 
Hawai'i 287, 305, 893 P.2d 138, 156 (1995)). In this case, Dr. 
Killeen's opinion was that an abruption was the most likely cause of death, meaning "at least a 51 percent chance that this is the cause of death," while Dr. Hariton agreed that "within a reasonable degree of probability," placental insufficiency caused by a placental separation was the cause of death. Thus, the court's finding is not clearly erroneous and is based on reasonable medical probability as opposed to a mere possibility. 
Finally, the State contests the court's finding of
 
causation because "Dr. Hirata provided the most likely
 explanation for the cause of fetal death and, contrary to
 Appellee's expert witnesses, Dr. Hirata substantiated his
 opinions with substantive medical reasoning." Again, we refuse
 to second-guess the trial court's determinations regarding
 witness credibility and weight. We find no evidence that Drs.
 Killeen and Hariton, who were qualified as experts in their
 respective fields, did not base their opinions on substantive
 medical reasoning. Further, it was not improper for the trial
 court to reject Dr. Hirata's opinion that the cause of death was
 not an abruption, but the result of a consanguineous pregnancy. 
Dr. Hirata did not examine Briandalynne's body or the placenta,
 but rather, ruled out a placental abruption because the
 delivering obstetrician's notes did not mention an observed
 abruption, placental hemorrhage, or hematoma, and Dr. Killeen's
 notes did not mention "histologic evidence" of an abruption. 
However, Dr. Killeen, who performed an autopsy on Briandalynne
 
37
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and examined the placenta, testified that a blood clot was not
 
required to diagnose an abruption, that a blood clot would not
 necessarily prove that an abruption occurred, and it was possible
 to have an abruption with "no features whatsoever in the
 resulting placenta." Additionally, Dr. Killeen stated, after
 looking at statistics on fetal morbidity in consanguineous
 pregnancies, "my conclusion was that that was a complete non-
factor in the death of the fetus," and Dr. Hariton stated that
 "there's no medical evidence [that the death could be because of
 incest] anywhere. I've not only reviewed the literature, I've
 gone to medical libraries, I've gone to perinatologists, gone to
 colleagues, and nobody's ever heard of a stillbirth related to
 incest." 
For these reasons, we refuse to set aside the Circuit
 
Court's challenged causation findings as clearly erroneous.
 
3. Damages
 
While the persons enumerated in HRS § 663-3(b)
16 may
 
recover damages for, among other things, loss of love and
 affection, under HRS § 663-3(a), "the legal representative may
 recover on behalf of the estate the reasonable expenses of the
 deceased's last illness and burial." In addition, under HRS
 § 663-7 (1993): 
A cause of action arising out of a wrongful act . . .
shall not be extinguished by reason of the death of the
injured person. The cause of action shall survive in favor
 of the legal representative of the person and any damages
shall form part of the estate of the deceased.
 
16
 These persons include "the surviving spouse, reciprocal
beneficiary, children, father, mother, and . . . any person wholly or partly
dependent upon the deceased person." HRS § 663-3(b).
 
38
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As we have previously held, the estate of a deceased person may
 
recover damages for the deceased's loss of enjoyment of life
 under HRS § 663-7 where the tortfeasor's negligent conduct
 contributed to the death. Ozaki v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of
 
Discovery Bay, 87 Hawai
'i 273, 288-89, 954 P.2d 652, 667-68 (App. 
1998), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 87
 Hawai
'i 265, 954 P.2d 644 (1998). "[I]t is generally accepted 
that 'unless the survival statute limits damages, the recovery is
 the same one the decedent would have been entitled to at death.'" 
Id. (citation and brackets omitted).
17
 
17 We note that not all states have distinct wrongful death statutes
and survival of claims statutes. States typically provide separate remedies,
like Hawai' i, or a single wrongful death cause of action that has varying
availability of pecuniary losses and/or personal injury damages. For example,the State of Washington allows for two causes of action: (1) a wrongful deathsuit by the surviving relatives, and (2) a survival of personal injury claimby the estate of the decedent. See Cavazos v. Franklin, 867 P.2d 674, 677 
(Wash. 1994). However, in Virginia, a personal injury claim can survive thedeath of the injured person so long as the injury is unrelated to the cause ofdeath; however, if the person's death was caused by the tortious personalinjuries, then his or her estate is foreclosed from bringing a survival actionand is limited to only the remedies provided in a wrongful death action. See 
Campbell v. Harmon, 628 S.E.2d 308, 312 (Va. 2006). Similarly, New Hampshirealso only provides one cause of action arising out of a wrongful death; itprovides relief for both the surviving relatives and for the estate of thedecedent. See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 556:7 & 556:9-14 (Westlaw 2015).
The varying forms of statutes, varying degrees of remedies, and
evolving jurisprudence, make generalizations about the application ofsurvival-of-claim statutes to claims on behalf of the deceased, but viable,unborn fetus much more complicated. However, at this time, it appears thatseventeen states plus the District of Colombia recognize at least some sort ofpersonal injury claims that survive the death of the viable, unborn fetus,nineteen (not including Hawai' i) have not decided the issue, and thirteen have 
affirmatively held that personal injury claims do not survive the death of theunborn fetus (with six of these thirteen states being jurisdictions which donot recognize wrongful death claims arising out of the death of a viable,unborn fetus). Put another way, of the forty-two jurisdictions that haverecognized wrongful death claims stemming from the death of viable fetuses, itappears that eighteen also recognize potential for the survival of some claimsof the viable, unborn child, seventeen have no precedent concerning thesurvival of an unborn child's claims, and seven have rejected allowing thesurvival of claims of the viable, unborn fetus.
More specifically, the District of Columbia and four states,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington, have recognized separate
and distinct remedies for both wrongful death and survival actions for viable,
unborn fetuses. See Greater Se. Cmty. Hosp. v. Williams, 482 A.2d 394, 398
 
(D.C. 1984); Amadio v. Levin, 501 A.2d 1085, 1089 (Penn. 1985); Fowler v.

The following nineteen states appear to recognize a viable, unborn
fetus under a single cause of action related to wrongful death: Connecticut,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Thirteen of
 these states appear to recognize some form of recovery for personal injury
sustained by a viable, unborn fetus. Notably, four of these states' wrongful
death laws only provide for pecuniary losses to survivors and do not provide
recovery for the personal injuries of a decedent, born or unborn, and two of
 these states' wrongful death laws only provide recovery for death of unborn
fetus to the fetus' natural mother. See Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 52-555

      While Castro did not reference HRS § 663-7 in her
 
complaint, a plaintiff's failure to cite the statutory basis for
 
her claim does not automatically render the complaint defective
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Briandalynne's estate was awarded $250,000 in
 
damages for the loss of enjoyment of life. However, her First
 Amended Complaint made no mention of HRS § 663-7. Thus, the
 State argues that "[b]ecause Appellee has not pursued a claim
 under § 663-7, and has not moved to amend her claim, she is
 foreclosed from being awarded damages under that statute. 
Appellee is limited to the damages allowed in HRS § 663-3 only."

Hawaii's rules of notice pleading require that a

In re Genesys Data Techs., Inc., 95 Hawai 'i 33, 41, 18 P.3d 895, 
903 (2001) (footnote omitted). 
In the present case, despite failing to cite to HRS 
§ 663-7, Castro did "set forth a short and plain statement of the 
claim" that provided the State with "fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests." Id. Castro's complaint made clear she was bringing a claim on 
behalf of Briandalynne's estate. Additionally, her complaint alleged that the defendants' negligence and/or gross negligence was a substantial factor in Briandalynne's death.
18 She prayed 
for general, compensatory, and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial. She did not specifically identify a claim for loss of enjoyment of life, but general damages include damages for the loss of enjoyment of life. Dunbar v. Thompson, 79 
Hawai
'i 306, 315, 901 P.2d 1285, 1294 (App. 1995). Additionally, 
"general damages are those damages which usually accompany the kind of wrongdoing alleged in the complaint so that the mere allegation of the wrong gives sufficient notice to the opposite party of the kind of damage that will be claimed at trial[.]" Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 50-51, 451 P.2d 814, 819 (1969). 
18
 Specifically, she alleged that:
 
The foregoing negligence and/or gross negligence of
Defendants was and is a legal cause and/or substantial
factor in causing the wrongful death of Plaintiff CASTRO's
daughter, BRIANDALYNNE CASTRO, and mental and emotional
distress to Plaintiff relating to her daughter's death and
such other and further injuries and effects and damages in
such amount as shall be shown at the time of trial.
 
42
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Further, Castro did not limit her request to special damages for
 
the costs of Briandalynne's last illness and burial. 
In sum, a liberal reading of Castro's complaint would
 
put the State on notice that (1) she was bringing forth a claim
 on behalf of Briandalynne's estate, (2) the claim arose out of
 the State's negligence resulting in Briandalynne's death, and (3)
 she would be pursuing general damages in an amount to be proven
 at trial, which could include damages for the loss of enjoyment
 of life. Thus, the complaint reasonably informed the State of
 what Castro's claims were, their basis, and what the State would
 have to defend against. For those reasons, it was not
 insufficient. See Hall, 53 Haw. at 215, 491 P.2d at 542 ("A
 
complaint may state a claim upon which relief can be granted even
 though it does not specifically name the statutory provision,
 rule, or regulation upon which the claim is based; it is
 sufficient that the complaint give notice of the transaction upon
 which the claim is based upon which relief can be granted."); 
see also Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 339 F.3d 9, 14-15 (1st
 Cir. 2003) (even though the complaint did not set forth the
 statutory basis for its claims, the court broadly construed it as
 alleging a cause of action under two possible remedial schemes). 
Accordingly, we conclude that Briandalynne's estate was not
 limited to damages for the costs of her last illness and burial. 
See HRCP Rule 54(c) ("Except as to a party against whom a
 judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant
 the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is
 
43
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the
 
party's pleadings.")
 
The State also argues that, even if Briandalynne's
 
estate is entitled to a damage award, there is insufficient
 evidence to support the court's award of $250,000 for her loss of
 enjoyment of life. Specifically, the State challenges FOF 56
 which found: "The evidence established that the baby was normal,
 with no congenital or development abnormalities. Despite the
 incarcerated status of her mother, Baby Castro's life and her
 loss of enjoyment of life, are of the nature and kind of any
 other infant." The State's challenge is based on the testimony
 of Dr. Hirata:
 
Dr. Hirata testified that there could be genetic disorders
that cannot be physically seen and that could only be
detected by genetic testing. The chances of this fetus
 hav[ing] genetic disorders is high, as Dr. Hirata testified,
particularly because of the close relationship of the
parents of the fetus. Thus, it is purely speculative to
conclude that the fetus is normal. Moreover, because the
fetus died in utero, it [is] more likely than not that the
fetus had a genetic defect.
 
Dr. Hirata testified that, in his opinion, the most
 
likely cause of death was the consanguineous pregnancy, that
 
offspring of a father-daughter mating are "often abnormal," and
 that the children of closely related parents have a high
 likelihood of inheriting deleterious mutations that could result
 in a genetic disorder. He also testified about a study that
 found that thirty-two percent of the offspring of first degree
 relatives born alive "would have either passed away, or would
 have significant mortality and morbidity." From that study, Dr.
 Hirata assumed that there was probably "a higher loss rate before
 delivery than after birth." 
44
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
However, Dr. Hirata had no evidence that Briandalynne
 
would have been in the thirty-two percent of offspring who either
 
died or had significant morbidity. He agreed that if she had
 made it to term and had been born alive, she was more likely to
 be one of the approximately two-thirds of such offspring who
 would be "healthy, normal human beings."
 
Further, Dr. Killeen testified that he could not find
 
any "gross congenital anomalies" meaning "visually we could not
 see any malformations of any kind." Nor did he observe any
 congenital or developmental abnormalities of any kind. Although
 Dr. Hirata testified that some genetic disorders could only be
 found with specific genetic testing and that it appeared that no
 such testing was done in this case, there was no evidence that
 Briandalynne had any such disorder. 
In sum, there was sufficient evidence to support the
 
court's finding that "the baby was normal, with no congenital or
 development abnormalities." Thus, we conclude that FOF 56 is not
 clearly erroneous.
 
The State also challenges the award of $100,000 to
 
Castro for loss of filial consortium and the award of $250,000
 for emotional distress, arguing that:
 
This damage award is based on speculation and is not
supported by the evidence. Appellee has been incarcerated
most of the time since the stillbirth of the fetus. There
 is no question that Appellee would not have been able to
live with the child had it survived. . . .
 . . . . 
Moreover, given Appellee's incarceration, there is no
credible evidence that Appellee would have been able to
develop any kind of relationship with her baby had the fetus
survived.
 
However, the Circuit Court expressly indicated that, in
 
45
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assessing Castro's damages for loss of filial consortium, it
 
considered Castro's incarcerated status, the uncertainty of her
 parole release date, and that her ability to live with and raise
 her child was uncertain.
19 Additionally, it was reasonable to
 
conclude that Castro would have had some relationship with her
 daughter once she was released from jail, especially in light of
 the finding that she grew to want her baby. 
With respect to the award for emotional distress, the
 
State argues that there is no credible evidence that Castro
 suffered emotional distress and that any evidence is conflicting
 at best. Dr. Sheila Wendler (Dr. Wendler) a psychiatrist at the
 
WCCC who had treated Castro and prescribed her medication on
 
several occasions, testified that she never saw any signs that
 Castro was suffering from any emotional distress over the loss of
 her fetus. However, Castro testified that she only saw Dr.
 Wendler about nine or ten times over the course of three and a
 half years, that each visit was not longer than five minutes, and
 that she did not discuss the loss of her baby because she was
 uncomfortable with her and "didn't know how to express
 [her]self." The State also points to a form signed by Castro in
 which she indicated that she had not recently experienced a
 significant loss such as a death in the family. However, this
 form was signed approximately six months after the stillbirth,
 and does not necessarily, as the State argues, "contradict[] her
 assertion of emotional distress resulting from the stillbirth." 
19
 The court noted, however, in FOF 62, that through a program called
"Women's Way," women parolees could live with and raise their newborns and
that Castro might be paroled in 2012. 
46
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the moments after learning her baby was dead, Castro
 
described herself as an emotional wreck. When she was
 
transferred back to the WCCC from the hospital, she "was a mess
 at that time." Even though she had been treated for PTSD and
 anxiety before her pregnancy, Castro said her emotions
 intensified after the stillbirth. "I'll never forget that stage,
 that depression stage I went through right after I lost my baby. 
It's totally different from my normal I guess mood swings or
 depression stages." Castro testified that after taking classes,
 including a grief class, "I realized that I was like suffering a
 lot of - they call it like PTSD, anxieties, depression, hidden
 anger, isolation. . . . And I was stuffing a lot of my feelings." 
She said that even five years after the loss of her fetus, she
 was still sad. 
In addition, other witnesses provided evidence that
 
Castro had suffered emotional distress. Castro's former
 cellmate, Jennifer Kong-Guillermo (Kong-Guillermo) testified that
 
Castro kept a picture of the baby displayed in their cell and
 
would always talk about the baby, including how she wanted to
 raise it better than she had been raised and wished it had lived. 
Although the State challenges Kong-Guillermo's credibility, we
 will not pass upon the trial court's determinations of
 credibility. 
Additionally, Plaintiff's Exhibit 160, an investigative
 
report written by Sergeant Venus Kakiva (Sgt. Kakiva) in response
 
to a disturbance Castro caused in OCCC on August 30, 2007
 
revealed that Castro was likely suffering from distress following
 
47
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the stillbirth. The report indicated that Castro was involved in
 
a disturbance that began with her yelling at another inmate and
 ended with her being restrained by corrections officers. The
 report included interviews with various corrections officers and
 inmates who indicated that Castro had been emotional and angry
 since the loss of her child.
20 Sgt. Kakiva reported that Castro 
began to share her experience of anger and frustration and
not knowing how to deal with her los[s]. . . . I, Sgt.
KAKVIA [sic] felt that FO-CASTRO's behavior is highly
relevant to the los[s] of her child which was stillborn. It
 is evident that her mental state is at a vulnerable and
 emotional state.
 
Sgt. Kakiva recommended that Castro be treated for Post Traumatic
 
Stress Disorder. 
Thus, we conclude there was sufficient evidence that
 
Castro suffered emotional distress as a result of Briandalynne's
 death. As the court's findings were not clearly erroneous, and
 we do not find its award of damages to be excessive, we will not
 disturb the Circuit Court's award of general damages. Viveiros
 
v. State, 54 Haw. 611, 614, 513 P.2d 487, 489 (1973); Lima v.
 Tomasa, 42 Haw. 478, 482-83 (Haw. Terr. 1958) ("[appellate
 courts] will not disturb the trial court respecting the amount of
 general damages unless the amount awarded is so excessive as to
 shock the moral sense").
 
20
 For example, the interviewees indicated that "it appeared that FO­
CASTRO was still suffering from Post Pardon [sic] Syndrome due to the fact
that FO-CASTRO just had experienced the los[s] of her unborn child that was
stillbirth[,]" "Since FO-CASTRO's experience with loosing [sic] her unborn
child, her behavior has been disruptive, emotional, and at times
unexplainable. . . . I think it's really taking a toll on her right now [,]"
and "FO-CASTRO is just acting out a lot anger because she lost her baby. It's
 like she's just going off because she feels that no one understands what she
. . . is going through." 
48
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
D. The State's Remaining Points of Error
 
In its conclusion, the State challenges two remaining
 
FOFs, contending that they show the Circuit Court's decision was
 based on sympathy and not upon the evidence or law.  First, the
 
State challenges FOF 60 which reads:
 
Despite this poor start to her pregnancy, Plaintiff
grew to want the baby, when she experienced the baby's
kicking. Plaintiff cooperated with her pre-natal care, took
her pre-natal vitamins, and reported vaginal bleeding
symptoms which were of concern to her. Plaintiff herself
 had not been raised by her parents, and had been in foster
care since she was a year old. Plaintiff believed the baby
would change her life for the better, and the baby
represented an opportunity for Plaintiff to give and receive
the unconditional love to a family member that Plaintiff
herself had never experienced. 
The State takes issue with the statement that Castro's
 
bleeding was of concern to her. However, as discussed above,
 
there is substantial evidence to support the finding that Castro
 made four or five reports of her bleeding to at least three ACOs. 
Further, according to Castro, the responses she received informed
 her that she would not be seen by the medical staff unless her
 pad became saturated. Thus, her failure to report her bleeding
 on other occasions can be explained by her reliance on the
 responses she got from the ACOs and not her lack of concern for
 her bleeding. 
The State also challenges FOF 61 which states that:
 
To Plaintiff, having this baby represented a rare oppor­
tunity for her to become a mother, for two reasons. First,
the pregnancy was the result of Plaintiff being raped by her
father, and was a situation that was unlikely to recur.
Second, Plaintiff was a lesbian who did not expect to have
an opportunity to conceive in the future. Plaintiff felt
 Baby Castro was her one chance to have a family of her own.
 
We agree that the evidence that Castro was raped is
 
scant, but it is not, as the State contends, nonexistent. Dr.
 
49
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Wendler testified that Castro had expressed severe anger towards
 
her father, saying he had raped her. 
The State also argues that there was no evidence that
 
Castro was a lesbian or that she believed Briandalynne was her
 "one chance to have a family of her own." Castro did testify
 
that she was homosexual. However, although there was evidence
 
that she wanted to keep the baby, we are unable to find evidence
 in the record that Castro believed this was her one chance to
 have a family of her own. 
Even assuming that these findings are erroneous, as
 
discussed above, there was substantial evidence to support the
 court's award of damages. "Erroneous findings of fact that are
 unnecessary to support the decision and judgment of the trial
 court are not grounds for reversal." Wright, 1 Haw. App. at 585,
 
623 P.2d at 100. Further, the damages awarded were not so
 excessive as to indicate that the court was motivated by sympathy
 for Castro rather than the evidence or law. Quedding v. Arisumi
 
Bros., Inc., 66 Haw. 335, 339, 661 P.2d 706, 709 (1983) ("a
 finding of an amount of damages . . . will not be disturbed on
 appellate review unless palpably not supported by the evidence,
 or so excessive and outrageous when considered with the
 circumstances of the case as to demonstrate that the [trial
 court] in assessing damages acted against rules of law or
 suffered [its] passions or prejudices to mislead [it]"). 
50
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, we decline to vacate or remand the court's decision
 
based on these grounds.21
