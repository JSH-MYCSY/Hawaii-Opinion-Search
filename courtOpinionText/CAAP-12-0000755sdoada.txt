STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RAYMOND EARL ARD, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 05-1-0062)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Raymond Earl Ard (Ard) appeals from
 
the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's (Circuit Court's) August
 
3, 2012 Order Denying Director of Health's Application for
 
Conditional Release Filed October 17, 2011.1
 
On March 2, 2005, Ard was charged with Count I:
 
Attempted Murder in the First Degree, Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) §§ 705-500 (1993), 707-701(1)(a) (1993) and 706-656 (1993 &
 
Supp. 2013); Count II: Murder in the Second Degree (1993), HRS
 
§§ 707-701.5 (1993) and 706-656; and Count III, Attempted Murder
 in the Second Degree, HRS §§ 705-500, 707-701.5, and 706-656. 
The charges stemmed from an attack on February 25, 2005, when Ard
 stabbed both his step-son (who was a minor at the time) and his
 neighbor, John Kerns (Kerns). While the boy survived, Kerns died

from his injuries. On May 25, 2006, after a bench trial, the 
Circuit Court found Ard guilty of Count I and not guilty of Counts II and III (citing Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 848 P.2d 966 (1993)). However, the court acquitted Ard on the ground of physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect. The court also found that Ard was not a proper subject for conditional release and committed him to the custody of the Department of Health (DOH). He was thereafter committed to the Hawai
'i State 
Hospital. 
On October 17, 2011, DOH moved for a mental examination 
by a three-panel board of examiners pursuant to HRS § 704-414 (Supp. 2013) and for Ard's conditional release pursuant to HRS § 704-412 (Supp. 2013). A three-panel board of examiners was appointed. The State of Hawai
'i, represented by the County of 
Kaua'i Prosecuting Attorney's Office, opposed Ard's conditional 
release. After receiving reports and testimony, on July 5, 2012, the Circuit Court denied the motion for conditional release. 
On appeal, Ard raises a single point of error,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in denying DOH's
 application for conditional release.
 
After carefully reviewing the record and the parties'
 
briefs, and analyzing the law relevant to the arguments, we
 resolve Ard's point of error as follows:
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court, in State v. Miller, set 
forth the standard of review applicable to the denial of an application for conditional release as follows: 
In reviewing sufficiency of the evidence, the
appellate court must view the evidence in the lightmost favorable to the state and determine if there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the
trier of fact. State v. Pone, 78 Hawai' i 262, 265, 892
P.2d 455, 458 (1995). "Substantial evidence is
credible evidence which is of sufficient quality andprobative value to enable a person of reasonablecaution to support a conclusion." Id. Moreover, "it iswell-settled that an appellate court will not passupon issues dependent upon the credibility ofwitnesses and the weight of the evidence[.]" Tachibanav. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 239, 900 P.2d 1293, 1306
(1995). Accordingly, the circuit court is "vested withthe authority to make the ultimate decision regardingwhether the evidence establishes the requisite conditionsfor release." State v. Dudley, 903 S.W.2d 581, 584 (Mo.App. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
W.D.1995) (citing State v. Ross, 795 S.W.2d 648, 650
(Mo.App.1990)).
 
84 Hawai 'i 269, 278-79, 933 P.2d 606, 615-16 (1997). 
Here, although there were conflicting opinions and 
testimony, there was substantial evidence to support the Circuit 
Court's determination that Ard continued to suffer from a mental disease and that he could not be released without danger to himself or others. In handing down its July 5, 2012 decision, the Circuit Court made clear that it placed great weight on Dr. Gerald McKenna's testimony and did not believe Ard could be released without risk to the safety of others in his community. Dr. McKenna's opinion stated, inter alia, that Ard "has a time bomb in him that is going to go off at some point in the future" and that his underlying mental illness was what caused him to commit murder in the first place. Dr. McKenna also expressed concern that Ard does not believe he has a psychiatric disorder and therefore is not likely to seek treatment on his own. Dr. McKenna's testimony provided substantial evidence to support the Circuit Court's decision. See Miller, 84 Hawai
'i at 278-79, 933 
P.2d at 615-16. This court will not pass upon the Circuit Court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence in this case. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i 
at 239, 900 P.2d at 1306. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's August 3, 2012 Order
 
Denying Director of Health's Application for Conditional Release
 Filed October 17, 2011 is affirmed.
