IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES HARRIS, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KANE'OHE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-12-023536)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley and Fujise, JJ.,
with Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant James Harris, Jr. (Harris) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered on August 6, 2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit, K
ane'ohe Division (District Court).1 The 
District Court convicted Harris of excessive speeding, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(2) (2007).

On appeal, Harris argues, among other things, that the
 
District Court erred in convicting him where the court (1) lacked
 jurisdiction over the case because the charge failed to allege
 the mens rea, an essential element; and (2) abused its discretion
 in admitting Officer Mark Kutsy's (Officer Kutsy) speed reading
 without a sufficient foundation as to the officer's training and

maintenance of the LTI [Laser Technology, Incorporated] 20-20
 
Ultralyte laser (Ultralyte).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Harris's points of error as follows, and reverse.
 
With regard to first point of error, Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai
'i (State) issued Harris a citation for excessive 
speeding; the citation summoned Harris to appear in district court for arraignment; at the arraignment hearing, Harris waived the reading of the charge; prior to the commencement of trial, the State orally charged Harris; and the oral charge included the mens rea. The citation, coupled with the oral reading of the charge constituted the complaint. See Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 5(b)(1) and 7(a), HRS ยง 291C-105(c) (Supp. 2014). Because the oral charge included the mens rea, the complaint was not defective. 
With regard to the second point of error, the District 
Court abused its discretion by admitting the speed-reading evidence because the State failed to establish that Officer Kutsy's training in the operation of the Ultralyte met the manufacturer's requirements. See State v. Amiral, 132 Hawai
'i 
170, 178-79, 319 P.3d 1178, 1186-87 (2014) and State v. Gonzalez, 128 Hawai
'i 314, 326-27, 288 P.3d 788, 800-01 (2012). Without 
establishing such, the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation for admission of the speed reading. Absent the speed reading, there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. 
Given our holding, this court need not address Harris's
 
remaining arguments. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on August 6,
