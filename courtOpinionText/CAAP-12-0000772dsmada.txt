ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Plaintiffs-
Appellants Teresa J. Moore and Sherri Parkinson from the Order
 Granting Defendant Donnalyn M. Mosier's Motion to Dismiss
 Complaint Filed April 26, 2012 Without Prejudice as to Defendant
 
Donnalyn M. Mosier, filed on August 10, 2012 in the Circuit Court
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the First Circuit. The August 10, 2012 order dismissed 
Defendant-Appellee Donnalyn M. Mosier as a defendant in the case without prejudice. The order was not certified pursuant to Hawai» i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b). The order 
did not address Appellants  claims made against Defendant-Appellee Bank of America, N.A. in the Complaint or Verified First Amended Complaint. Therefore, it was not a final appealable order. See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai» i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). In addition, the record on appeal does not contain a judgment entered on the August 10, 2012 
order. Therefore, there is no final appealable judgment that resolves all claims against all parties. Id. ; HRCP Rule 58. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
