NO. CAAP-12-0000774
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KENNEDY MAGNO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 11-1-0348(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kennedy Magno (Magno) appeals from
 
the Judgment; Conviction and Probation Sentence; Notice of Entry,
 
filed on August 1, 2012 in the Family Court of the Second Circuit
 (Family Court).
1
 
After pleading no contest in FC-CR No. 11-1-0348(4),
 
Magno was found guilty of Abuse of Family or Household Member, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906 (Supp.
 
2012). 
On appeal, Magno contends the Family Court erred by
 
denying his Motion for Withdrawal of No Contest Plea because he
 
did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently enter a no
 contest plea because he thought he was pleading no contest to a
 charge of Abuse of Family or Household Member in a different
 case, FC-CR No. 11-1-0419(4).

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Magno's point of error as follows:
 
Magno claims that he was confused about which Abuse of
 
Family or Household Member charge he was pleading to and did not
 intend to plead no contest in FC-CR No. 11-1-0348(4). Magno also
 alludes to possible confusion with other charges, which were
 filed in Cr. No. 11-1-0644. Thus, he argues that he has
 demonstrated a fair and just reason to withdraw his plea. 
The Family Court did not err by denying Magno's Motion 
for Withdrawal of No Contest Plea because Magno did not present a fair and just reason for withdrawal of the plea. State v. Gomes, 
79 Hawai
'i 32, 36, 897 P.2d 959, 963 (1995). 
On September 20, 2011, Magno was charged with Abuse of 
Family or Household Member for an incident that occurred on
 September 19, 2011. The case was docketed as FC-CR No. 11-1­0348(4). Magno was released after posting bail on September 20,
 2011.
 
On November 7, 2011 Magno was charged with another
 
count of Abuse of Family or Household Member for an incident that
 allegedly occurred with the same complaining witness but on
 November 3, 2011. That case was docketed as FC-CR No. 11-1­0419(4). Magno was taken into custody due to the new charge.
 
On November 8, 2011, the State filed a Motion for an
 
Order to Show Cause and Issuance of a Warrant of Arrest because
 Magno was charged with another crime while on bail in FC-CR No.
 11-1-0348(4). 
However, also on November 8, 2011, the State's Motion
 
to Dismiss Without Prejudice was granted in FC-CR No. 11-1­0419(4) and the second Abuse of Family or Household Member charge
 relating to the November 3, 2011 incident was dismissed.
 
On November 29, 2011, the FC-CR No. 11-1-0348(4) case
 
was called and Magno appeared with counsel who stated that Magno 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
wanted to plead no contest to the charge without any prior
 
agreement with the State. Magno confirmed that he was pleading
 no contest to an Abuse of Family or Household Member charge. 
After going through the colloquy with Magno about his no contest
 plea, the Family Court also addressed a bail violation due to
 Magno's arrest for the second abuse charge. In discussing the
 bail violation with Magno's counsel, the Family Court noted that
 "[t]he allegation is that he committed a second abuse on November
 3
rd while this abuse was pending trial," to which Magno 
interrupted and stated: "[t]hat's not what I'm admitting to." 
This statement by Magno directly contradicts his later claim that
 he thought he was pleading no contest to the November 2011 abuse
 charge.
 
On March 28, 2012, Magno testified during a hearing on

 
the Motion for Withdrawal of No Contest Plea that he knew on
 November 8, 2011 that the charge in FC-CR No. 11-1-0419 had been
 dismissed because he had asked why he was being released that day
 from jail.
 
It is clear that at the time Magno pled no contest, he
 
knew that he was pleading no contest to the Abuse of Family or
 Household Member charge related to the September 2011 incident in
 FC-CR No. 11-1-0348(4) and not to a charge related to the
 November 2011 incident in FC-CR No. 11-1-0419(4).

 We also reject any suggestion that Magno was confused with charges
filed in Cr. No. 11-1-0644. The Indictment in Cr. No. 11-1-0644 was not filed
 
until December 5, 2011, and the charges did not include Abuse of Family or
Household Member. Magno could not have been confused with Cr. No. 11-1-0644
because those charges had not been filed when he pled no contest on November
29, 2011 and none of the charges were for Abuse of Family or Household Member.
