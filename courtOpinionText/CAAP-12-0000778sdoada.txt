APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 12-1-0210)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This case involves an allegedly unfinished construction
 
contract ("Contract") at the home of Respondents/Cross­
Petitioners-Appellees Ramon and Cassie Romero (the "Romeros"). 
Patrick K.S.L. Yim served as the arbitrator ("Arbitrator Yim") in
 the case. On August 1, 2012, the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit ("Circuit Court")  confirmed the arbitrator's award. 
Movant/Cross-Respondent-Appellant Noel Madamba Contracting LLC
 ("Madamba") timely appealed.
 
Madamba appeals from the following orders entered in
 
the Circuit Court: the August 27, 2012 Order Granting
 Respondents/Cross-Petitioners' Application to Confirm Final Award
 of Arbitrator ("Order Confirming Final Award"); the August 27,
 2012 Order Denying Motion to Vacate Final Award of Arbitrator
 Rendered on April 25, 2012, Filed April 30, 2012; the

September 20, 2012 Judgment; the October 15, 2012 Order Granting
 
Respondents/Cross-Petitioners' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and
 Costs and the October 15, 2012 Judgment for Attorneys' Fees and
 Costs.

On appeal, Madamba asserts that the trial court erred
 
in (1) precluding Madamba from deposing Cassie Romero ("Cassie")
 regarding her alleged "fail[ure] to comply with the requirements
 of [Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")] Chapter 672E before making a
 demand for arbitration"; (2) denying Madamba's Motion to Vacate
 Final Award of Arbitrator Rendered on April 25, 2012 ("Motion to
 Vacate") where the Romeros allegedly "failed to comply with the
 requirements of HRS Chapter 672E before making a demand for
 arbitration"; (3) refusing to permit Madamba to depose Dispute
 Prevention & Resolution, Inc. ("DPR") personnel and Arbitrator
 Yim regarding Arbitrator Yim's failure to disclose his connection
 with the Romeros's counsel, Cades Schutte ("Cades"); (4) denying
 Madamba's Motion to Vacate in light of Arbitrator Yim's failure
 to disclose his connection with Cades; (5) denying Madamba a jury
 trial regarding the Romeros's compliance with HRS Chapter 672E
 and Arbitrator Yim's failure to disclose; (6) issuing the
 Judgment and Judgment for Attorneys' Fees and Costs as premised
 on the allegedly erroneous Order Confirming Final Award; and (7)
 affirming Arbitrator Yim's award of attorneys' fees in favor of
 the Romeros.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 consolidate Madamba's points and resolve them as follows:
 
A. HRS Chapter 672E Issues
 Madamba asserts several points of error related to
 
Arbitrator Yim's ruling that the Romeros's September 7, 2010
 letter to Madamba specifying, among other things, several alleged
 workmanship defects ("September 7 Letter") constituted a notice
 of claim as required by HRS § 672E-3. We find no error because
 
2
 This is a consolidated appeal. On November 28, 2012, prior to
briefing, this court ordered that appellate case CAAP-12-0000868 be
consolidated with and under CAAP-12-0000778.
 
2
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
it was solely for Arbitrator Yim to decide whether that letter 
satisfied HRS § 672E-3's statutory prerequisite for legal action. Daiichi Hawai
'i Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawai 'i 325, 
336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003); Ventress v. Japan Airlines, 603 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir. 2010) (applying HRS § 658A-23(a)(4) and citing Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai
'i 226, 240, 54 P.3d 397, 
411 (2002)). 
Madamba argues that HRS § 672E-3 operates as a
 
jurisdictional gateway to arbitration, and that Arbitrator Yim's
 application of it violated HRS § 658A-23(a)(4). Even if HRS
 § 672E-3 is considered jurisdictional in nature, Madamba's
 attempt to garner our review of Arbitrator Yim's ruling through
 HRS § 658A-23(a)(4) must fail. Madamba's premise, founded on an
 allegation that the law was erroneously applied, cannot stand as
 grounds for concluding that the arbitrator exceeded his powers. 
Ventress, 603 F.3d at 679 ("An arbitrator does not exceed the
 arbitrator's powers by misunderstanding or incorrectly applying
 the law."). 
Moreover, as Madamba correctly observes, satisfaction 
of HRS § 672E-3 was a condition precedent to a demand for arbitration. HRS § 658A-6, however, divides responsibility for preliminary arbitrability determinations between court and arbitrator, and explicitly assigns sole responsibility to the arbitrator for "decid[ing] whether a condition precedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-6(c) 
(Supp. 2013). In light of this statutory delegation and the general principle that parties to arbitration necessarily accept the inherent risk of misapplication of law, Daiichi, 103 Hawai
'i 
at 336, 82 P.3d at 422, there was nothing illegitimate about Arbitrator Yim's ruling or his further arbitration of the dispute.
3 For this reason, we find no error with the Circuit

 Madamba also argues that the award should be vacated as contrary
to public policy, insofar as the result here allegedly contravenes the
legislature's express purpose in affording contractors the opportunity to
remedy defects prior to the onset of litigation. See 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 
119, § 1 at 450. Madamba does not identify where in the record it raised its
public policy argument below. Assuming for the sake of argument that it did,
Madamba fails to show that an explicit public policy, well defined and
dominant and ascertained by the laws and legal precedents, has been clearly
violated, especially where the legislature has explicitly provided that the

Court's decision to deny Madamba the opportunity to depose Cassie
 
regarding her original conception of the September 7 Letter. 
B. Failure to Disclose and Evident Partiality Issues
 Madamba maintains that Arbitrator Yim's failure to
 
disclose the possibility of his entering an attorney-client
 relationship with Cades demonstrated evident partiality. Madamba
 argues that the Circuit Court, having found that Arbitrator Yim
 should have disclosed this possibility, therefore erred by not
 vacating the award.
 
Arbitrators have a statutory duty to "disclose to all
 
parties . . . any known facts that a reasonable person would
 consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator
 . . . , including . . . [a]n existing or past relationship with
 any of the parties . . . , their counsel or representatives, a
 witness, or another arbitrator." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-12(a)(2)
 
(Supp. 2013). Arbitrators also have "a continuing obligation to
 disclose . . . any facts . . . which a reasonable person would
 consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator." 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-12(b). The failure to disclose such facts
 
permits, but does not require, a court to vacate an arbitration
 award. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-12(d). 
A court is required, however, to vacate an award where 
the failure to disclose rises to the level of "evident partiality." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-23(a)(2)(A) (Supp. 2013). 
Determining "what constitutes evident partiality . . . is a difficult question," Kay v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 119 Hawai
'i 219, 226, 194, P.3d 1181, 1188 (App. 2008) (brackets and 
internal quotation marks omitted), although Hawai 'i has adopted 
the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of evident partiality. Id., 
at 228 n.7, 194 P.3d at 1190 n.7 (citing Daiichi, 103 Hawai 'i at 
339, 340, 342, 82 P.3d at 425, 426, 428, and Sousaris v. Miller, 
arbitrator, not the courts, should determine if a condition precedent to
arbitration has been fulfilled. See Inlandboatman's Union of the Pac. v. 
Sause Bros., Inc., 77 Hawai' i 187, 193-94, 881 P.2d 1255, 1261-62 (App. 1994)
(quoting United Paperworkers Intern. Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S.
29, 43 (1987)); H AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-6(c). Furthermore, there is no
indication that Madamba was denied an opportunity to remedy the problems
identified in the September 7 Letter; it appears that Madamba simply electedto leave the problems unresolved.

92 Hawai 'i 534, 542, 993 P.2d 568, 576 (App. 1998)). 
Evident partiality may exist either in the form of 
actual bias or where "undisclosed facts demonstrate a 'reasonable 
impression of partiality.'" See Daiichi, 103 Hawai 'i at 340, 82 
P.3d at 426 (quoting Valrose Maui, Inc. v. Maclyn Morris, Inc., 105 F. Supp. 2d 1118, 1124 (D. Haw. 2000)). "However, not all dealings rise to the level of creating the impression . . . of possible bias so as to warrant vacat[ur.]" Id. at 341, 82 P.3d 
at 427. "The burden of proving facts which would establish a reasonable impression of partiality rests squarely on the party challenging the award." Id. at 339, 82 P.3d at 425 (quoting 
Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n Local Union #420 v. Kinney Air Conditioning Co., 756 F.2d 742, 745 (9th Cir. 1985)). 
Here, Arbitrator Yim, in agreeing to abide by the DPR
 
Rules governing the arbitration, bound himself to the further
 duty to disclose "any past, present, or possible future
 relationship with the parties, their witnesses, [and] their
 counsel. . . ." (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that
 Arbitrator Yim failed to disclose that it appeared that he might
 become a client of Cades for purposes of restating his pension
 plan. Arbitrator Yim was therefore in violation of the DPR
 Rules, although not necessarily in violation of HRS § 658A­12(a)(2), as the latter expressly limits disclosure obligations
 to past or present relationships. 
The violation of a disclosure rule does not per se 
constitute evident partiality. Compare H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A­
12(c) and (d) (permitting, but not mandating, vacatur for violating a statutory disclosure rule), with § 658A-23(a)(2)(A) (mandating vacatur for evident partiality). However, Madamba's position appears to be that where an arbitrator does not disclose a possible future attorney-client relationship with one party's counsel, in violation of a disclosure rule, such nondisclosure necessarily constitutes evident partiality. Our case law is clear, however, that absent evidence of actual bias, a nondisclosure amounts to evident partiality only where the "undisclosed facts demonstrate a reasonable impression of partiality." Daiichi, 103 Hawai
'i at 340, 82 P.3d at 426 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(quoting Sousaris, 92 Hawai 'i at, 542, 993 P.2d at 576) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
In addition, under HRS § 658A-12(e), evident partiality
 
under HRS § 658A-23(a)(2) is presumed when an arbitrator fails to
 
disclose a "known, . . . existing, and substantial relationship
 with a party[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. 658A-12(e) (emphasis added). 
Here, Madamba alleges no existing relationship with a party. HRS
 § 658A-12(e) does not make the same presumption of evident
 partiality for a potential future relationship with a party's
 counsel.
 
We decline to adopt Madamba's proposed categorical 
position. See Daiichi, 103 Hawai
'i at 341, 82 P.3d at 427 
("[N]ot all dealings rise to the level of creating the impression . . . of possible bias so as to warrant vacat[ur.]"). The facts of this case bear out our decision. The potential attorney-client relationship that, at furthest, remained inchoate during the pendency of arbitration was fostered by neither client nor attorney. 
Pension Services Corporation ("PSC") was retained by
 
Arbitrator Yim in the mid-1990s to maintain and administer
 personal retirement accounts on his behalf. PSC alone made the
 determination that Arbitrator Yim's pension plan restatement
 would be handled by one of two law firms, and eventually chose
 Cades. PSC negotiated the roughly $2,500 legal fee that would be
 charged to each client regardless of which law firm was assigned
 to the client. PSC advised that it would coordinate the
 necessary legal work with the selected firm. Apart from his
 expectation that the legal bills would be sent directly to him
 from Cades, Arbitrator Yim anticipated having no interaction with
 the law firm. 
Such a relationship, practically speaking, was 
anticipated to be minimal at best. That it was also merely potential, and never consummated, further distances it from the sort of relationships found in cases where Hawai
'i courts have 
concluded that evident partiality was established. See, e.g., Kay, 119 Hawai
'i at 223, 194 P.3d at 1185 (arbitrator failed to 
disclose that she solicited one of the parties for donations); 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Valrose Maui, 105 F. Supp. 2d at 1124 (arbitrator failed to
 
disclose that he spoke with the attorney for one of the parties
 about the possibility of arbitrating an unrelated matter, but
 also, as a result, was actually engaged to do so); Nordic PCL
 Const., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, No. CAAP-11-0000350, 2014 WL 624870
 at *9–11 (Haw. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2014) (sdo) (arbitrator had not
 disclosed that he was both engaged by one party's counsel's law
 firm as a neutral arbitrator in three separate matters during the
 pendency of arbitration proceedings and had an attorney-client
 relationship with that law firm in his trusteeship capacity). In
 contrast, while it should have been disclosed according to the
 rules to which the parties agreed, Arbitrator Yim's
 "relationship" with Cades lacked the significance, actuality, and
 contemporaneous nature of the relationships in those other cited
 cases. In light of its potential and "arms-length" nature, we
 conclude that Arbitrator Yim's failure to disclose his merely
 potential relationship with Cades did not amount to evident
 partiality. 
We also find no error with the Circuit Court's decision
 
to rule on Madamba's Motion to Vacate prior to Madamba having
 deposed Arbitrator Yim and various DPR personnel. Madamba sought
 their depositions in order to resolve alleged factual issues
 pertaining to whether Arbitrator Yim failed to disclose and also
 the manner and accuracy of disclosures once made. The Circuit
 Court agreed with Madamba that Arbitrator Yim had failed to
 disclose, but ultimately concluded that nondisclosure of the
 potential relationship did not amount to evident partiality. We
 agree and conclude that, in this circumstance, the depositions of
 Arbitrator Yim and DPR personnel were not warranted. 
Hawai
'i law states that the general rule precluding 
testimony from an arbitrator or a representative of an arbitration organization does not apply "[t]o a hearing on a motion to vacate an award under section 658A-23(a)(1) or (2) if the movant establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the award exists." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 658A-14(d)(2) (2013). Because 
we agree with the Circuit Court that the failure to disclose the potential relationship did not amount to evident partiality, and 
7
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
because the material facts appear to be established and
 
unchallenged as to that potential relationship, we conclude that
 a prima facie case to vacate the award has not been established.
4
 
Thus, under HRS § 658A-14(d)(2), Madamba was not entitled to take
 the depositions of Arbitrator Yim or DPR personnel.
 
C. Attorneys' Fees
 Madamba contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
affirming Arbitrator Yim's award of attorneys' fees, arguing that
 the Contract did not provide for the award of attorneys' fees.
 The Contract, however, specified: "In case suit is instituted on
 this Contract, the prevailing party shall receive from the
 adverse party reasonable attorneys' fees . . . ." We find no
 error with the Circuit Court's confirmation of Arbitrator Yim's
 award of attorneys' fees.
 
D. Judgments
 Madamba asserts that the Judgment and Judgment for
 
Attorneys' Fees and Costs were issued erroneously, based on his
 arguments, addressed supra, that the Order Confirming Final Award
 was issued in error. Because we have found no merit to those
 arguments, we find no error in the judgments.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 27, 2012 Order
 
Granting Respondents/Cross-Petitioners' Application to Confirm
 Final Award of Arbitrator; the August 27, 2012 Order Denying
 Motion to Vacate Final Award of Arbitrator Rendered on April 25,
 2012, Filed April 30, 2012; the September 20, 2012 Judgment; the
 October 15, 2012 Order Granting Respondents/Cross-Petitioners'
 
4
 Madamba also sought a jury trial on "factual issues related to the
failure to disclose claim," citing to Mehau v. Reed, 76 Haw. 101, 107, 869
P.2d 1320, 1326 (1994), for the proposition that because it has a claim for
damages it has a right to a jury trial. Here, however, the Circuit Court was
not resolving the merits of a cause of action, but rather, was ruling on
motions to either confirm or vacate an award, and was doing so pursuant to the
statutory prescription that such motion is to be "heard in the manner provided
by law or rule of court for making and hearing motions." H
AW. REV. STAT.
 
§ 658A-5 (Supp. 2013). Mehau is therefore inapposite. More to the point may
be whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary. See Clawson v. Habilitat,
Inc. 71 Haw. 76, 79, 783 P.2d 1230, 1232 (1989). In Clawson, however, an
evidentiary hearing was necessary only because material facts were in dispute.
As noted above, the material facts here appear already to be established.
