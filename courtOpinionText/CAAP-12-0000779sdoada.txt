HENRY CHESTER CROSBY, III, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(KONA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 3DTA-12-01020; REPORT NO. C12009097)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Henry Chester Crosby, III (Crosby)
 
appeals from Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered on
 
August 3, 2012 (Judgment), in the District Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit, Kona Division (District Court).  Crosby was charged
 
with and convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the
 
influence of an intoxicant in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2012) and inattention to
 
driving in violation of HRS ยง 291-12 (Supp. 2012). Crosby raises
 
three points of error on appeal, which appear to challenge the
 
basis for charging him, various evidentiary rulings, and the
 
justness of his conviction, but provides no transcripts or other
 
support for his contentions.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
1
 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo, Jr., presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the issues raised by the parties, we conclude that Crosby's
 
points of error are without merit.
 
Accordingly, the District Court's August 3, 2012
 
Judgment is affirmed.
