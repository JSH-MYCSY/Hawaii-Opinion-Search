JAMES H. HALL, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
CAPITAL ONE, N.A., Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0148)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant James H. Hall's (Hall's)
 
appeal from the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's August 10, 2012
 Order Granting with Prejudice Defendant Capital One, N.A.'s
 Motion to Dismiss [Hall's] Complaint Filed January 17, 2012,
 Filed April 19, 2012" because the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (circuit court) has not yet reduced the order to a
 separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
this case pursuant to Rule 58 of Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641–1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2012) authorizes appeals to the Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641–1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641–1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has 
promulgated HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
For example, in Jenkins, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
dismissed an appeal from orders granting defendants' motions to dismiss a complaint and an amended complaint, because the circuit court had not yet reduced the dismissal orders to a separate judgment. Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 117, 869 P.2d at 1336. In 
another case involving a dismissal, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
explained that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the 
necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corp., 
81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) (emphases added). 
Furthermore, even if the circuit court reduces the 
order to a separate judgment, "[a]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP 54(b)." Jenkins, 
76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis in original). 
The August 10, 2012 order is not a judgment, and the
 
circuit court has not yet reduced it to a separate judgment, as
 HRCP Rule 58 requires. Absent a separate judgment, Hall's appeal
 is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellate No. CAAP-12-0000781
 
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
