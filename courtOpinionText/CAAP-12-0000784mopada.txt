IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
SHEILA J. BELARMINO, Claimant-Appellee-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION,
Employer-Appellant-Appellee, Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2010-041(K); (4-03-10035))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant-Appellee-
Appellant Sheila J. Belarmino appeals from the Decision and Order 
filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board ("Board") on August 14, 2012 (the "August 14, 2012 Decision and Order"). The Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations Disability Compensation Division ("Director") originally adjudicated Belarmino's claims against Employer­Appellant-Appellee State of Hawai
'i, Department of Education on 
February 4, 2010 ("February 4, 2010 Decision") for a lower back injury sustained during a work-related incident on April 9, 2003 ("April 9, 2003 Injury").
1/ 
1/
 The Director's February 4, 2010 Decision stated that:
 
The Director finds, based upon the Findings of Fact and
Principles of Law, the claimant's average weekly wages will be
increased to $387.90.
 
The Director finds, based upon the Findings of Fact and
   
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In its August 14, 2012 Decision and Order, the Board
 
modified the Director's February 4, 2010 Decision by concluding
 
that Belarmino's average weekly wage at the time of her April 4,
 2003 Injury was $332.23; Belarmino was entitled to temporary
 total disability benefits from April 12, 2003 through March 15,
 2009; and Belarmino sustained 10% permanent partial disability of
 the whole person as a result of her April 9, 2003 Injury. The
 Board affirmed the Director's conclusion that Belarmino did not
 present a prima facie case for oddlot permanent total disability. 
On appeal, Belarmino alleges that the Board erred in:
 
(1) modifying the end date of her temporary total disability
 benefits period from December 17, 2009 to March 15, 2009 because
 Employer failed to issue a notice of intent to terminate as
 required by Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 386-31(b);
 (2) determining that she failed to present a prima facie case for
 odd-lot permanent total disability; and (3) failing to find that
 she sustained a psychological injury and permanent psychological
 disability as a result of her April 9, 2003 Injury.
2/ We vacate
 
in part and affirm in part the Board's August 14, 2012 Decision
 and Order.
 
Principles of Law, the claimant is entitled to temporary total
disability benefits payable by the employer from 4/9/2003
through 12/17/2009. The Director determines that although
Vocational Rehabilitation services were terminated effective
 3/15/2009, the employer failed to notice the claimant of their
intent to terminate temporary total disability benefits
pursuant to section 386-31(b), HRS.
 
The Director finds, based upon the Findings of Fact and
Principles of Law, that the claimant is not entitled to
 permanent total disability benefits. The Director finds the
 claimant has not presented evidence to substantiate that she
meets "odd-lot" criteria nor has she presented evidence to
substantiate she is permanently, totally disabled from
 working.
 
The Director finds, based upon the Findings of Fact and
Principles of Law, the claimant is entitled to 7% permanent
partial disability of the whole person (low back).  The
 Director credits Dr. Sasaki's 5/15/2009 report and the
 claimant's testimony. 
2/
 Belarmino's points of error have been re-written and re-ordered
for clarity.

I. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
The standard of review for Board decisions is well
 
established:
 
Appellate review of a [Board] decision is governed by
HRS § 91–14(g) (1993), which states that:
 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
 instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse
or modify the decision and order if the substantial
rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced
because the administrative findings, conclusions,
decisions, or orders are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction
of the agency; or
 (3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 (4) Affected by other error of law; or
 (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;
or
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse
of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
 
discretion.
 
We have previously stated:
 [Findings of Fact] are reviewable under the clearly
erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision
was clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record.
 
[Conclusions of Law] are freely reviewable to determine
if the agency's decision was in violation of
 constitutional or statutory provisions, in excess of
statutory authority or jurisdiction of agency, or
affected by other error of law.
 
A [Conclusion of Law] that presents mixed questions of
fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous
standard because the conclusion is dependent upon the
facts and circumstances of the particular case. When
 mixed questions of law and fact are presented, an
appellate court must give deference to the agency's
expertise and experience in the particular field. The
court should not substitute its own judgment for that of
the agency.

570, 573–74 (2001) (quoting In re Water Use Permit 
Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000))
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
[A Finding of Fact] or a mixed determination of law and
fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
substantial evidence to support the finding or
 
determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to
support the finding or determination, the appellate
court is left with the definite and firm conviction that
 a mistake has been made. We have defined "substantial
 evidence" as credible evidence which is of sufficient
 quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

II. BACKGROUND
 
A. Belarmino's claim-related medical history.
 Belarmino was employed by Employer as a permanent part-
time school custodian for Wilcox Elementary School since July 22,
 
1996. On April 9, 2003, Belarmino sustained a work-related
 injury to her lower back "[w]hile lifting [the] cover of [a]
 grease trap and leaning down to suck up [the] waste with [a] wet
 vacuum. . . ." Belarmino testified that the grease trap was too
 heavy for her to lift alone. While cleaning the trap with her
 co-worker, her co-worker inadvertently lost his grip on the trap,
 and she was forced to bear the full weight. Belarmino stated
 that she "felt a snap. . . . [i]n my back, my neck, and it went
 down to my legs." It is undisputed in this appeal that
 Belarmino's April 9, 2003 Injury, where Belarmino sustained a
 lower back injury, arose out of and in the course of Belarmino's
 employment. On April 22, 2003, Employer prepared a WC-1
 Employer's Report of Industrial Injury form, and later accepted
 liability for Belarmino's work injury. 
Following the April 9, 2003 Injury, Belarmino sought
 
medical care from Dr. Robert J. Teichman, at the Kauai Medical
 Clinic, and Dr. William A. Renti Cruz, her primary care
 physician. Dr. Renti Cruz referred Belarmino for physical
 therapy. Belarmino was then referred to Dr. Heather Hopkins, a
 physiatrist, who recommended more physical therapy. 
On November 3, 2003, Dr. Hopkins noted in a progress
 
record that Belarmino continued to have back pain, and no longer
 attended physical therapy because she was not making significant
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
progress. Dr. Hopkins further noted that Belarmino wanted to
 
return to work, but that she was not able to return to the heavy
 lifting required by her current job. Dr. Hopkins' objective exam
 stated the following: "Sensation intact to light touch to both
 lower extremities. Strength within normal limits, both lower
 extremities. Trunk range of motion within functional limits but
 painful on return to upright position from flexion. Painful with
 extension and posterior element over pressure. Gait, somewhat
 forward flexed posture, tends to guard the back." Dr. Hopkins
 then recommended that Belarmino "return to work in a light duty
 type setting[, and i]f her current work environment is unable to
 provide light duty, vocational rehabilitation should be
 considered to retrain patient for another position that will
 allow less lifting." Dr. Hopkins opined that Belarmino "has
 reached maximum medical improvement[, and t]here are no further
 treatment options I can offer. . . ." 
In an undated evaluation report reviewed by Dr. Robert
 
Sussman, Teresita de Dios, R.N., the evaluator, opined that,
 based upon functional testing, Belarmino could work at a
 sedentary level job. Between 2003 and 2005, Belarmino continued
 to see Dr. Hopkins and Dr. Renti Cruz for treatment and
 medication related to the April 9, 2003 Injury. 
On January 10, 2005, Dr. Lorne K. Direnfeld, a
 
neurologist, examined Belarmino for an independent medical
 examination ("IME") at Employer's request. Belarmino complained
 to Dr. Direnfeld that her back was "very sore and very
 uncomfortable . . . in my back and okole . . . pains running down
 my legs, front and back . . . like somebody's grabbing me." She
 further stated that "she is never comfortable sitting[,] . . .
 has difficulty standing comfortably for more than 10 minutes[,
 and] . . . has difficulty lifting a three-cup rice cooker with
 rice in it." Belarmino informed Dr. Direnfeld that she did not
 want to return to work for Employer, she did not know what else
 she could do, but was "willing to try anything." 
Dr. Direnfeld made the following diagnoses, "1. Pain
 
disorder associated with both psychological factors and a general
 medical condition, versus pain disorder associated with
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
psychological factors. 2. Chronic lumbosacral strain." Dr.
 
Direnfeld further opined that data suggests that in Belarmino's
 case "diagnosis of pain disorder associated with psychological
 factors is more likely than the diagnosis of pain disorder
 associated with both psychological factors and a general medical
 condition[.]" Dr. Direnfeld stated that Belarmino reached
 maximum medical stability as of her visit to Dr. Hopkins on
 January 15, 2004, and that there was "no disfigurement related to
 the effects of the 4/09/03 injury." 
Between 2005-2007, Belarmino sought the medical
 
expertise of Dr. Dennis Scheppers for continued care of her
 April 9, 2003 Injury. On February 20, 2007, Belarmino underwent
 a Functional Capacity Evaluation ("FCE") in order to determine
 her readiness to return to work, and assess current functional
 abilities. According to Florian Flores, P.T., who conducted the
 FCE, Belarmino "may be able to work below SEDENTARY Physical
 Demand Level (PDL) for an 8 hour day; however, there were
 indications of submaximal effort during the FCE[,]" and
 therefore, Flores estimated that Belarmino should be able to work
 at the Sedentary-light PDL. Flores also noted that Belarmino may
 not have exerted her best effort during the functional capacity
 test. 
On May 1, 2007, Dr. Scheppers submitted an Estimated
 
Capacity & Limitation Form to Belarmino's vocational
 rehabilitation provider. On the form, Dr. Scheppers provided
 Belarmino's various physical limitations, which included an
 assessment that Belarmino could frequently lift up to 10 pounds,
 but could not bend, squat, crawl, or climb, among other physical
 activities. 
On April 8, 2009, Dr. Vern K. Sasaki, an occupational
 
medical physician, conducted an IME on Belarmino at Employer's
 request. Dr. Sasaki noted that Belarmino's pain behaviors and
 subjective complaints were not supported by objective findings,
 and were corroborated by Dr. Direnfeld's previous IME, Dr.
 Hopkins' assessment, and the FCE conducted by Flores. Dr. Sasaki
 diagnosed Belarmino with "Pain disorder associated with
 psychological factors and a general medical condition" and
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Lumbosacral strain/sprain and myofascial pain." Belarmino
 
informed Dr. Sasaki that she had "constant achy low back pain[,
 and that] the pain averages 8 out of 10 on a scale of 0 to 10."
 Dr. Sasaki also noted that Belarmino resisted participation in a
 physical therapy program, but she should still be encouraged to
 conduct home-based stretching and strengthening exercises. Dr.
 Sasaki opined that Belarmino's condition was stable, and that she
 reached maximum medical improvement. Dr. Sasaki rated Belarmino
 at 5% whole person impairment as a representation of Belarmino's
 current impairment. 
On June 12, 2009, Dr. Robert J. Brown, psychologist,
 
conducted a permanent partial disability ("PPD") examination on
 Belarmino. Dr. Brown states that he originally examined
 Belarmino on December 20, 2005 for an IME. At that time, he
 opined that "psychological factors have played a role in delaying
 her overall recovery and prolonged disability." Following a
 diagnostic interview with Belarmino, Dr. Brown opined that
 Belarmino appeared to be of low average intelligence, and showed
 symptoms of exaggeration and overreaction. He further stated
 that it appeared that Belarmino "want[ed] me to conclude that
 psychological factors are not involved or play only a minor role
 in her chronic low back pain disorder." Dr. Brown further stated
 that "[i]t is difficult to tell if she truly believes her pain is
 a 10, or if she is intentionally exaggerating her pain for
 secondary gain reasons." Dr. Brown stated that Belarmino's
 overall whole person rating "is considered mild with regards to
 classes of impairment due to mental and behavioral disorders[,]"
 and further opined that Belarmino had 10% impairment in her
 activities of daily living. 
The Board concluded that it would not credit Dr.
 
Schepper's report as a certification of temporary total
 disability. Finding of fact ("FOF") 18 in the August 14, 2012
 Decision and Order states:
 
18. On August 3, 2009, Claimant saw Dr. Scheppers.
She rated her pain at 10/10. Dr. Scheppers noted that
Claimant was not then employed.  He instructed Claimant to
 follow up in 4 weeks for medication refill or sooner if
needed.
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Scheppers completed a WC-2 Physician's Report form
dated August 4, 2009, which noted that Claimant's work
accident resulted in disability for work for the period
July 30, 2009 through October 30, 2009. He noted that
 Claimant was treated on June 10, 2009 with a prescription only
and that he examined Claimant on August 3, 2009.
 
The Board does not credit Dr. Schepper's WC-2
 
Physician's Report as a certification of temporary total
disability, because Claimant['s] condition had been permanent,
stable, and stationary as of November 2003, because the
certification seeks to verify or validate disability
retroactively, and because it extends to a period longer than
one month.
 
On November 6, 2009, Dr. Scheppers submitted an Interim WC-2
 
Physician's Report, and checked off "None" in the portion of the
 form asking him to describe any permanent defect or
 disfigurement.
 
B. Procedural history of Belarmino's claim. 

On April 22, 2003, Employer prepared a WC-1 Employer's
 
Report of Industrial Injury form for Belarmino's April 9, 2003
 Injury. On July 20, 2009, Belarmino filed a request for a
 hearing before the Director. Belarmino cited permanent
 disability issues, the period of temporary disability, and the
 extent of permanent total disability as the reasons for her
 hearing request. In her supporting position statement, Belarmino
 related that Employer voluntarily paid temporary total
 disability, and the dates paid were from April 13, 2003, until
 March 15, 2009, ten days after the end of vocational
 
3/
rehabilitation services.  On December 17, 2009, the Director
 held a hearing addressing the following issues:
 
What is the claimant's average weekly wages?
 
Is the claimant entitled to temporary total disability?
 Is the claimant entitled to permanent total disability under
the "odd lot" doctrine?
 
3/
 Employer voluntarily paid Belarmino's temporary total disability
at a weekly compensation rate of $189.62. The Director later determined that Employer should pay Belarmino $258.61 per week for temporary total disability.It does not appear that Employer ever adjusted its payments to Belarmino, ormade additional payments to Belarmino. However, Belarmino does not raise thisissue on appeal, and this court does not need to further address this issue.
Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai' i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012)
(citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717,
727 (2007)) (noting that this court may "disregard a particular contention if
the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position").

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Is the claimant entitled to permanent partial disability?
 
On February 4, 2010, the Director issued the Decision, and
 
concluded that:
 
1.	 Sections 386-21 and 386-26, HRS, said employer shall pay
for such medical care, services, and supplies as the
nature of the injury may require.
 
2.	 Claimant's average weekly wages is $387.90.
 
3.	 Section 386-31(b), HRS, said employer shall pay to
claimant weekly compensation of $258.61 for temporary
total disability from work beginning (waiting period:
4/9/2003 through 4/11/2003) 4/12/2003 through 12/17/2009
for 348.8571 weeks, for a total of $90,217.94.
 
4.	 Section 386-32(a), HRS, said employer shall pay to
claimant weekly compensation of $301.72 for 7% permanent
partial disabilty of the whole person beginning
12/18/2009 for 41.9833 weeks, for a total of $12,667.20.
 
5.	 No disfigurement resulted from this accident. 
On February 9, 2010, Employer appealed from the February 4, 2010
 
Decision to the Board. In that appeal, Employer raised the issue
 regarding the amount of Belarmino's average weekly wages. The
 Board permitted Belarmino to raise the following issues to be
 addressed on appeal:
 
a.	 What is the period of temporary total disability
resulting from the work injury of April 9, 2003; and
 
b.	 What is the extent of permanent disability resulting
from the work injury of April 9, 2003.
 
A trial before the Board was set for April 13, 2011. 
On April 13, 2011, two witnesses testified during
 
trial: Nolan Yonekura, a pre-audit clerk for the Department of
 
Education, payroll section, was called as Employer's sole
 witness, and Belarmino. At trial Belarmino explained how the
 April 9, 2003 Injury occurred, and described the medical
 treatment and vocational rehabilitation services she received
 following the injury.
 
The Board's August 14, 2012 Decision and Order included
 
FOF and conclusions of law ("COL"), which state, in pertinent
 part, as follows:
 
The Board makes the following Conclusions of
Law. . . .
 
. . . .
 
9
   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. The Board concludes that the period of temporary
total disability resulting from Claimant's April 9, 2003 work
injury was (waiting period: April 9, 2003 through April 11,
2003) April 12, 2003 through March 15, 2009, at which point
Claimant's VR case was closed.
 
3. With respect to permanent disability, the Board
affirms the Director's February 4, 2010 decision. The Board
 concludes that Claimant is neither permanently and totally
disabled on a medical basis nor permanently and totally
disabled on an odd-lot basis.
 
Rather, the Board concludes that, based on the opinions
in the record, beginning December 18, 2009 Claimant sustained
ten percent (10%) permanent partial disability of the whole
person for her April 9, 2003 low back injury.
 
Where, as in the instant case, no physicians have
credibly opined that Claimant is permanently and totallydisabled, Claimant may avail herself of the odd-lot doctrineor rule. "Under the odd-lot doctrine, an injured employee maybe considered permanently and totally disabled if he or she isunable to obtain employment because of work-related permanentpartial disability combined with such factors such as age,
education, and work experience."  Bumanglag v. Oahu Sugar Co.,
78 Hawai' i 275, 281 (1995) (citing Yarnell v. City Roofing, 
Inc., 72 Haw. 272, 275 (1991)). 
The odd-lot doctrine weighs multiple factors and where
a claimant demonstrates prima facie belonging in the odd-lot
category, the burden of proving employability shifts to the
employer.
 
Claimant did not present a prima facie case that she
 
should be placed in the odd-lot category  of permanent total
disability.
 
Belarmino timely appealed from the August 14, 2012 Decision and
 
Order to this court.
 
III. 
DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Board erred in modifying the end date of
Belarmino's temporary total disability benefits from
December 17, 2009 to March 15, 2009.
 
Citing to HRS section 386-31(b), Belarmino asserts that
 
the Board erred in modifying the end date of her temporary total
 
disability benefits. Specifically, Belarmino challenges FOF 154/
 
and COL 2.5/  Belarmino's argument has merit.
 
4/
 FOF 15 states, "[t]he Board finds Claimant entitled to temporary
total disability benefits through March 15, 2009." 
5/
 COL 2 states, "[t]he Board concludes that the period of temporary
total disability resulting from Claimant's April 9, 2003 work injury was
(waiting period: April 9, 2003 through April 11, 2003) April 12, 2003 through
March 15, 2009, at which point Claimant's VR case was closed."
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Once an employer has begun paying temporary total
 
disability benefits to an employee, "[t]he payment of these
 
benefits shall only be terminated upon order of the director or
 if the employee is able to resume work." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 386­31(b) (Supp. 2009). Because the employee's ability to resume
 work may sometimes be disputed, the statute further provides that
 when the employer believes that the employee is able to resume
 work, "the employer shall notify the employee and the director in
 writing of an intent to terminate the benefits at least two weeks
 prior to the date when the last payment is to be made." Id. The
 
notice must explain the reason for stopping payment, and must
 further "inform the employee that the employee may make a written
 request to the director for a hearing if the employee disagrees
 with the employer." Id. In addition, the Hawaii Administrative
 
Rules ("HAR") reiterate that a written notice of intent to
 terminate temporary total disability benefits must be sent to the
 director and the employee "in every case" unless the employee has
 actually returned to work, in which case a notice need not be
 sent. Haw. Admin. R. § 12-10-26.
 
The record establishes that Employer paid temporary
 
total disability benefits to Belarmino from April 12, 2003 until
 March 15, 2009. Employer terminated temporary total disability
 benefits on March 15, 2009, ten days after Belarmino's vocational
 rehabilitation services ended, without providing Belarmino or the
 Director with written notice, as required by HRS § 386-31(b). 
During the December 17, 2009 hearing, the Director found that
 because the benefit payments had never been properly terminated,
 they had to be continued until he ordered otherwise, an event
 that he deemed to occur upon the date of the hearing.
 
Employer argues that Belarmino was not entitled to the
 
extended payments between March 15, 2009 and December 17, 2009
 because the only redress available is through the Director
 ordering Employer to pay into a special compensation fund under
 
6/
HRS section 386-31(b)  or face other penalties pursuant to HRS
6/
 HRS section 386-31(b) states in relevant part, "[a]n employer or
insurance carrier who fails to comply with this section shall pay not more
than $2,500 into the special compensation fund upon the order of the director,
 
11
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
section 386-92.7/ Accordingly, Employer asserts that the
 
Director could have chosen to subject Employer to penalties, but
 
did not do so, and that the extended payments that Belarmino
 argues above is not the appropriate remedy. Adopting
 December 17, 2009 as the termination date of Belarmino's
 temporary total disability benefits is not a penalty, however,
 but the necessary consequence of applying HRS section 386-31(b).
 Therefore Employer's argument is without merit.
 
The Board erred in modifying Belarmino's temporary 
total disability benefits end date from December 17, 2009 to March 15, 2009 because the record lacks substantial evidence to support this conclusion. See Pulawa, 136 Hawai
'i at 225, 361 
P.3d at 452. As the Director noted in the February 4, 2010 Decision, Employer did not provide written notice of its intent to terminate Belarmino's temporary total disability benefits, as required by HRS section 386-31(b) and HAR section 12-10-26. See 
Malahoff v. Saito, 111 Hawai
'i 168, 191, 140 P.3d 401, 424 
(2006). Further, at the April 13, 2011 trial before the Board, Employer did not present evidence that it provided Belarmino with a written notice of intent to terminate her temporary total disability benefits, or in the alternative, that Belarmino returned to work, allowing for temporary total disability benefits to automatically end without notice. Haw. Admin. R. § 12-10-26. Accordingly, the Board erred in modifying the end date of Belarmino's temporary total disability benefits from December 17, 2009 to March 15, 2009. 
B.	 The Board did not err in determining that Belarmino
failed to present a prima facie case for odd-lot
permanent total disability.
 
In her second point of error, Belarmino contends that
 
the Board erred by failing to apply the odd-lot doctrine to her
 
in addition to other penalties prescribed in section 386-92." Haw. Rev. Stat.
 
§ 386-31(b).
 
7/
 HRS section 386-92 provides in relevant part, "there shall be
added to the unpaid compensation an amount equal to twenty per cent thereof
payable at the same time as, but in addition to, the compensation[.]" Haw.
Rev. Stat § 386-92 (Supp. 2009).

case. Belarmino contests FOF 268/ and COL 3.9/ In support of her
 
argument, Belarmino refers to Tsuchiyama v. Kahului Trucking and
 
Storage, Inc., 2 Haw. App. 659, 638 P.2d 1381 (1982), Yarnell v.
 City Roofing, Inc., 72 Haw. 272, 813 P.2d 1386 (1991), and
 Larson's Workers' Compensation treatise. However, this argument
 is without merit.
 
The odd-lot doctrine states that "where an employee
 
receives a work-related permanent partial disability which

8/
 FOF 26 states:
 
The Board finds that Claimant did not meet her burden in
 
presenting a prima facie case that she should be placed in the
odd-lot category of permanent total disability. Her age (date
of birth: December 30, 1958), education (completed two years
of high school), and experience (State employee for ten years
preceding the date of accident) does not render her, in fact,
unable to obtain employment. Rather, Claimant completed her
VR Plan, which included training, and the reason for not
obtaining employment was because of an abnormal and irregular
labor market on Kauai. Yet, Claimant testified that she had
not made any effort to seek employment for about two years
after VR had closed. 
9/
 COL 3 provides:
 
With respect to permanent disability, the Board affirms
the Director's February 4, 2010 decision. The Board concludes
 that Claimant is neither permanently and totally disabled on
a medical basis nor permanently and totally disabled on an
odd-lot basis.
 
Rather, the Board concludes that, based on the opinions
in the record, beginning December 18, 2009 Claimant sustained
ten percent (10%) permanent partial disability of the whole
person for her April 9, 2003 low back injury.
 
Where, as in the instant case, no physicians have
credibly opined that Claimant is permanently and totallydisabled, Claimant may avail herself of the odd-lot doctrineor rule. "Under the odd-lot doctrine, an injured employee maybe considered permanently and totally disabled if he or she isunable to obtain employment because of work-related permanentpartial disability combined with such factors such as age,
education, and work experience." Bumanglag v. Oahu Sugar Co.,
78 Hawai' i 275, 281 (1995) (citing Yarnell v. City Roofing, 
Inc., 72 Haw. 272, 275 (1991)). 
The odd-lot doctrine weights multiple factors and where
a claimant demonstrates prima facie belonging in the odd-lot
category, the burden of proving employability shifts to the
employer.
 
Claimant did not present a prima facie case that she
 
should be placed in the odd-lot category of permanent total
disability.

etc., renders him, in fact, unable to obtain employment, he is 
entitled to be treated as being permanently totally disabled." Tsuchiyama, 2 Haw. App. at 660-61, 638 P.2d at 1382 (where this court held that the Board did not clearly err in determining that claimant's disability qualified him as an odd-lot worker based on the pain claimant experienced when he returned to work, limitations of motion and ability, age, education, his limp, and his difficulty with the English language); Yarnell, 72 Haw. at 275, 813 P.2d at 1388 ("If the evidence of degree of obvious physical impairment, coupled with other facts such as claimant's mental capacity, education, training, or age, places claimant prima facie in the odd-lot category, the burden should be on the employer to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant." (quoting 2 A. Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law § 57.61(c) at 10-178 (1989))). The employee bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case that he or she falls within the odd-lot category. Tsuchiyama, 2 Haw. App. at 661, 638 P.2d at 1382. If the employee establishes a prima facie case that he or she falls within the odd-lot category, the burden then shifts to the employer "to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant." Yarnell, 72 Haw. at 
275, 813 P.2d at 1388 (where the Hawai
'i Supreme Court concluded 
that the Board improperly put the burden on the claimant to prove that he was unable to work as a result of the work injury, and did not answer the question of whether the claimant properly established a prima facie case). While it is a question of fact as to whether a person falls into an odd-lot category, id. at 276, 813 P.2d at 1389 (citing Worker's Comp. Claim of Cannon v. FMC Corp., 718 P.2d 879, 885 (Wyo. 1986)), shifting the burden of proof is a question of law. Id. 
In this case, the Board's determination that Belarmino
 
did not establish a prima facie case that she fell within the
 odd-lot doctrine is not clearly erroneous. Based on the Board's
 findings and evidence submitted, Belarmino is capable of
 performing at least light duty or sedentary work. Dr. Hopkins,
 Dr. Sussman, and Mr. Flores all concluded that Belarmino is
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
qualified for work, at least at a sedentary or light duty 
capacity. Dr. Direnfeld and Dr. Scheppers opined that Belarmino did not sustain permanent impairment or disfigurement related to the work injury. Dr. Scheppers provided vocational rehabilitation services and an assessment of Belarmino's abilities and limitations. In his assessment, Dr. Scheppers stated that although Belarmino was unable to bend, squat, crawl, or climb, Belarmino could lift and carry up to ten pounds frequently, sit for six hours, stand for an hour, walk for an hour, and use her hand for six hours. Dr. Sasaki noted that Belarmino resisted participation in an active physical therapy program, and subjective complaints were not consistent with objective findings. Likewise, Dr. Direnfeld opined "that the data suggested the diagnosis of pain disorder associated with psychological factors was more likely than that of pain disorder associated with both psychological factors and a general medical condition." The Board also noted that it did not credit Dr. Brown's opinions on permanent impairment due to Dr. Brown's acknowledgment of Belarmino's refusal to seek psychological treatment for financial gain. With regard to this point of error, Belarmino only challenges FOF 26 on appeal. FOFs not challenged on appeal are binding on this court. State v. Kiese, 
126 Hawai
'i 494, 502, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012) (citing Kelly v. 
1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai 'i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007 
(2006)). 
The Board also determined that Belarmino was born on
 
December 30, 1958; that she had an 11th grade education; and that
 she was a State employee for ten years preceding the date of the
 accident. The Board noted Belarmino's former employment as a
 custodian for the County of Kauai, as a car cleaner for Budget
 Rent-A-Car, and an adult supervisor during lunch periods at
 Wilcox School prior to her employment as a custodian for
 Employer. Although Belarmino argues that her weak educational
 attainment, limited job skills, and diminished physical and
 mental capacities demonstrate her qualifications for odd-lot
 status, the Board did not find that Belarmino possessed any of
 these traits, and this court "give[s] deference to the [Board]'s
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assessment of the credibility of witnesses and the weight the 
[Board] gives to the evidence."  Moi v. State, Dep't of Pub. 
Safety, 118 Hawai 'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 756 (App. 2008); 
Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai 'i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002) 
("It is well established that courts decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or to review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field.") (quoting Igawa v. Koa House Restaurant, 97 Hawai
'i 402, 409-10, 38 P.3d 570, 577-78 (2001))). 
The Board found that during vocational rehabilitation, 
Belarmino was provided with a private tutor for desk job computer training, and observed that in the February 6, 2009 Final Report prepared by Patti Inoue, C.R.C., Belarmino's vocational rehabilitation provider, Belarmino was encouraged to continue to submit applications for work within her physical capabilities. Further, the Board noted that Belarmino was able to type, but not well; had a computer at home, but did not know how to use email; and was able to use a calculator to add numbers. Although the Board noted that according to Ms. Inoue, Belarmino was unable to obtain employment due to a poor labor market on Kaua
'i, it 
determined that Belarmino stopped looking for employment in 2009, after her vocational rehabilitation services ended. 
This case is distinguishable from Tsuchiyama, where, in
 
addition to having only a high school degree and sustaining
 between 16% and 25% permanent disability of the whole person,
 claimant also suffered severe pain after sitting for a relatively
 short time, walked with a noticeable limp, had difficulty with
 the English language, and continued to pursue employment, even
 after retirement. Tsuchiyama, 2 Haw. App. at 660, 638 P.2d at
 
1382. In this case, the Board concluded that Belarmino sustained
 10% permanent partial disability of the whole person, that she
 completed her vocational rehabilitation computer training class,
 that she was able to sit for 6 hours, and had no permanent
 impairment or disfigurement related to the work injury. Further,
 the Board made no finding that Belarmino struggled with the
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
English language, and also determined that Belarmino stopped
 
looking for work in 2009, two years before her trial. 
Accordingly, the Board did not err in determining that Belarmino
 failed to present a prima facie case for odd-lot permanent total
 disability. Because Belarmino did not meet her prima facie
 burden, the burden did not shift to Employer to prove the
 existence of regular suitable employment.
 
C.	 The Board did not err when it failed to find that
 
Belarmino sustained a psychological injury and
permanent psychological disability as a result of her
April 9, 2003 Injury.
 
In her final point of error, Belarmino argues that the
 
Board erred when it failed to find that Belarmino sustained a
 
psychological injury and permanent psychological disability. 
Belarmino challenges the final paragraph of FOF 17,
10/ and the
 
entirety of COL 3,11/ and requests that this court determine that
 
she is entitled to an additional 5% permanent partial disability
 of the whole person due to her alleged mental health condition. 
We decline Belarmino's invitation.
 
Belarmino argues that the Board incorrectly determined
 
the credibility of Dr. Brown and his medical report. Although we
 defer to the Board's assessment of the credibility of witnesses
 
10/
 FOF 17 states, in relevant part:
 
Dr. Brown opined that Claimant's 'overall whole person
rating is considered mild with regards to classes of
 
impairment due to mental and behavioral disorders.'  He opined
that Claimant had mild impairment (10%) in her activities of
daily living and adaptation.
 
He stated that Claimant's "prognosis to ever return to
work is now poor and until she is rated as permanent and
 stable she has little or no motivation to seek psychological
or psychiatric treatment. I therefore am in [agreement] that
her condition is permanent, stable and ratable."
 
The Board does not credit Dr. Brown's opinions on
permanent impairment, which were provided despite his
 acknowledgment of Claimant's refusal for reasons of financial
gain to seek psychological treatment. 
Belarmino challenges only the last paragraph of FOF 17. 
11/
 COL 3 states in relevant part that "the Board concludes that,
based on the opinions in the record, beginning December 18, 2009 Claimant
sustained ten percent (10%) permanent partial disability of the whole person
for her April 9, 2003 low back injury."
 
17
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the weight of the evidence, we review the Board's FOFs under 
the clearly erroneous standard and its COLs de novo. Moi, 118 
Hawai'i at 242, 188 P.3d at 756. The final paragraph in FOF 17 
does not address the extent of Belarmino's entitlement to permanent partial disability benefits. Nevertheless, that paragraph is supported by the findings included in the prior two paragraphs, which are unchallenged. Among other things, Dr. Brown's report stated that Belarmino had not sought psychiatric or psychological treatment despite his recommendation that she do so, that Belarmino had no motivation to seek treatment until she was rated, and that he had considered the four main categories of mental health functions provided in the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (5th ed.) and found that Belarmino had mild impairment in two categories and no impairment in the other two categories. Although concluding that Belarmino's impairment was "mild," Dr. Brown's report appeared to contradict that conclusion in light of his belief that Belarmino would benefit from more treatment and that she was exaggerating her pain. In light of that and in view of the fact that Dr. Brown did not provide a specific rating amount, the Board did not clearly err in finding that Dr. Brown's report did not provide a basis for concluding that Belamrmino had yet to suffer a permanent psychological injury. Therefore, the final paragraph in FOF 17 is not clearly erroneous. 
Accordingly, the Board did not err in concluding in COL
 
3 that Belarmino sustained a 10% permanent partial disability of
 the whole person from her April 9, 2003 Injury without mentioning
 Dr. Brown's opinions on Belarmino's mental health because the
 Board did not find Dr. Brown's opinions credible, and no other
 FOF discussed a permanent psychological disability from which the
 Board could conclude otherwise. Consequently, we do not reach
 Employer's contention that Belarmino was barred from raising the
 claim on appeal due to her failure to file a written claim to the
 Director under HRS section 386-82.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate in part and affirm in
 
part the Board's August 14, 2012 Decision and Order. We remand
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the case to the Board for entry of a decision and order
 
consistent with this opinion.
