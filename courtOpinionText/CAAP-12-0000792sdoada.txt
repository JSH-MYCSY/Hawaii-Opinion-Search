SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Anthony K. Kekona, Jr. (Kekona)
 
appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Dismissing Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Under HRPP Rule
 40, i.e. Document Entitled "HRS 660-6 and 660-7 Order to Show
 Cause," filed on September 5, 2012 (Order Denying Relief), in the
 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).

On appeal, Kekona concedes that his previous Petition,  
pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
was denied. However, Kekona asserts that the law in Hawai 'i has 
changed since then and he again claims that the court lacks 
jurisdiction because he is a citizen of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Kekona also claims that the Circuit Court erred by denying his request for appointment of counsel to assist in asserting this claim.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kekona's points of error as follows:
 
Recent Hawai
'i law reaffirms the jurisdiction of the 
court over Kekona. In State v. Kaulia, 128 Hawai 'i 479, 487, 291 
P.3d 377, 385 (2013), the supreme court held that "the [S]tate's criminal jurisdiction encompasses all areas within the territorial boundaries of the State of Hawai
'i." Further, 
"whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of its origins, the State of Hawai
'i . . . is now, a lawful government," and 
"[i]ndividuals claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State are not exempt from application of the State's laws." Id. (citations, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Therefore, Kekona's claim that the Circuit Court lacked
 
jurisdiction is without merit and the Circuit Court did not err
 by denying his request for appointment of counsel. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's September 5,
 
2012 Order Denying Relief is affirmed.
