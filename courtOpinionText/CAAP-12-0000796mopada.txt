in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Lizarraga argues that the circuit court

Appellee the Bank of New York Mellon fka the Bank of New York as
 Trustee for the Certificateholders CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan
 Trust 2006-OA21, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006­OA21 (BNYM) and (2) denying Lizarraga's motion to compel
 
discovery.

I. BACKGROUND
 
It is undisputed that on August 21, 2006 Lizarraga 
executed and delivered to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. 
(Countrywide) a promissory note (Note) in the amount of $715,500. 
As security for the Note, Lizarraga executed a mortgage 
(Mortgage) on his property in Kilauea, Hawai 'i (Property) to 
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) "as nominee 
for [Countrywide] and [Countrywide's] successors and assigns."3 
Lizarraga failed to make the payments due under the
 
Mortgage, so Countrywide sent Lizarraga a notice of intent to
 
accelerate his Mortgage payments (Notice of Intent) on December
 
17, 2008. The Notice of Intent informed Lizarraga of his default
 
amount, notified him of his right to cure the default, and warned
 that failure to do so would accelerate the Mortgage payments and
 possibly result in the foreclosure and sale of the Property.
 
On March 7, 2010, MERS, as nominee for Countrywide,
 
executed an "Assignment of Mortgage" (AOM), which assigned the
 
Mortgage to BNYM. On the same day, BNYM executed a "Notice of
 
Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale"
 (Foreclosure Notice) because Lizarraga failed to cure his
 
default.

 This court notes that Lizarraga's opening brief does not comply
with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(a), which provides
that "[e]xcept after leave granted, an opening . . . brief shall not exceed 35
pages[.]" Counsel is warned that future violations of HRAP Rule 28 may resultin sanctions.

On May 14, 2010, BNYM proceeded with the foreclosure
 
sale and, being the only bidder, purchased the Property for
 
$675,000. Kevin A. Durham, who was authorized to act on behalf
 of BNYM, executed "Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under
 Power of Sale" (Affidavit of Foreclosure) on May 19, 2010. On
 
June 2, 2010, the Affidavit of Foreclosure was recorded with the
 
State of Hawai
'i Bureau of Conveyances. On July 6, 2010, BNYM 
executed and recorded a quitcliam deed (Deed), through which BNYM
 
transferred all of BNYM's "right, title, and interest in" the
 
Property to itself. The Deed stated:
 
THAT WHEREAS, under and pursuant to [Grantor-BNYM's]
foreclosure rights under power of sale as provided in Hawaii
Revised Statutes Sections 667-5 through 667-10, and that
certain first mortgage dated 8/21/2006 and recorded on
8/31/2006 in the Bureau of Conveyance of the Regular
Document System of the State of Hawaii, as Document No.
2006-159953, [Grantor-BNYM] held a public auction on
5/14/2010 at 12 NOON, wherein the [Property] was offered for
sale and wherein [Grantee-BNYM] was the purchaser of said
[P]roperty, all as set forth in [Affidavit of Foreclosure],
recorded as aforesaid on 6/2/2010 as Document No.
2010-075466;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, [Grantor-BNYM] in consideration of the
sum of $675,000.00 to [Grantor-BNYM] paid by [Grantee-BNYM],
receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, does hereby Release,
Remise and Forever Quitclaim all of [Grantor-BNYM's] right,
title and interest in and to all of the [Property] . . . unto
[Grantee-BNYM];
 
And the reversions, remainders, rents, issues and
profits thereof and all of the right, title and interest of
the [Grantor-BNYM], both at law and in equity, therein and
thereto;
 
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the same, together with all rights,
easements, privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging
or appertaining or held and enjoyed therewith unto [Grantee-
BNYM], absolutely and in fee simple.
 
On August 2, 2010, BNYM notified Lizarraga that the Property had
 
been sold in a non-judicial foreclosure sale and demanded that
 Lizarraga vacate the Property within ten calendar days. Lizarraga
 refused to vacate the Property.
 
On June 21, 2011, BNYM filed a "Verified Complaint for
 
Ejectment" (Complaint) in Circuit Court, alleging that BNYM was
 
the fee simple owner of the Property through a non-judicial
 
foreclosure sale. BNYM's Complaint sought (1) a judgment granting
 BNYM exclusive possession of the Property; (2) a writ of
 possession directing the removal of Lizarraga from the Property
 
3

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and that the Property be placed in BNYM's possession; and (3) an
 
award of damages, attorneys' fees, and costs to BNYM.
 
On January 27, 2012, BNYM filed "Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession" (Motion for SJ & Writ).
 
In support of its Motion for SJ & Writ, BNYM attached various
 
documents to demonstrate that it was entitled to foreclose upon
 and possess the Property, including the Deed, the Affidavit of
 Foreclosure, and a declaration from BNYM's counsel stating that
 the "foreclosure was conducted in compliance with applicable
 Hawaii law, specifically [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] Section
 
667-5 and 667-10, as amended, and the terms and conditions of the
 
recorded mortgage that was foreclosed."
 
On February 2, 2012, pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
4
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 34  Lizarraga served BNYM with Lizarraga's
first request for production of documents (Request for
Production). On February 27, 2012, BNYM filed a motion for
 
protective order against Lizarraga's Request for Production
 
(Motion for Protective Order). BNYM's Motion for Protective Order
 
stated: 
[Lizarraga's] document request at this late juncture
seeks information which is not relevant to the subject matter
involved in the instant ejectment action and is not relevant
to the subject matter involved in the instant ejectment
action and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. As a result, [BNYM] seeks
a court order ruling that the discovery sought in
[Lizarraga's] request not be had.
 
On March 21, 2012, Lizarraga filed "[Lizarraga's] (1)

 HRCP Rule 34 provides, in relevant part:
 
Rule 34.	 PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, ELECTRONICALLY STORED
INFORMATION AND TANGIBLE THINGS AND ENTRY UPON

Opposition to [BNYM's] Motion for Protective Order and (2) Motion
 
to Compel [BNYM] to Produce the Documents" (Motion to Compel). 
The circuit court held hearings on April 10, 2012 and May 1, 2012
 
to consider BNYM's Motion for SJ & Writ and Motion for Protective
 Order, as well as Lizarraga's Motion to Compel. At the May 1,
 2012 hearing, the circuit court denied Lizarraga's Motion to
 Compel, granted BNYM's Motion for Protective Order, and granted
 BNYM's Motion for SJ & Writ.
 
On May 22, 2012, Lizarraga filed "[Lizarraga's] Motion
 
for Rehearing of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ
 of Possession Filed January 27, 2012, and [Lizarraga's] Motion to
 Compel [BNYM] to Produce Documents Filed March 21, 2012 and/or for
 Reconsideration of this Court's May 1, 2012 Decision to Grant
 [BNYM's] Motion for Summary Judgment and Deny [Lizarraga's] Motion
 to Compel" (Motion for Rehearing/Reconsideration).
 
On June 13, 2012, the circuit court entered its written
 
order denying Lizarraga's Motion to Compel, order granting BNYM's
 Motion for Protective Order, Order Granting Motion for SJ & Writ,
 and Judgment for Possession. On June 29, 2012, the circuit court
 entered a Writ of Possession. On August 28, 2012, the circuit
 court held a hearing on Lizarraga's Motion for Rehearing/
 Reconsideration and denied his motion. On September 18, 2012, the
 circuit court entered its written Order Denying Motion for
 Rehearing/Reconsideration.
 
Also on September 18, 2012, Lizarraga filed a notice of
 
appeal from the circuit court's (1) Order Granting Motion for SJ &
 Writ; (2) Judgment for Possession; and (3) Order Denying Motion
 for Rehearing/Reconsideration.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
[An appellate] court reviews a trial court's grant of
summary judgment de novo. O'ahu Transit Servs., Inc. v.
Northfield Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 231, 234, 112 P.3d 717, 720
(2005). The standard for granting a motion for summary
judgment is well settled: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions
on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show
that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. A fact is material if proof of that
fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
one of the essential elements of a cause of action or
 
defense asserted by the parties. The evidence must be
 viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving
party. In other words, [the appellate court] must view
all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom
 in the light most favorable to the party opposing the
motion.
 
Price v. AIG Hawai' i Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 106, 110, 111 P.3d
1, 5 (2005) (original brackets and citation omitted). 
Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai 'i 92, 104, 
176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has further 
explained the respective burdens of the moving and non-moving
 
parties on summary judgment:
 
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as to
all material facts, which, under applicable principles of
substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a
matter of law. This burden has two components.
 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing
support for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material
fact exists with respect to the essential elements of the
claim or defense which the motion seeks to establish or which
 the motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed facts,
it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Only
when the moving party satisfies its initial burden of
production does the burden shift to the non-moving party to
respond to the motion for summary judgment and demonstrate
specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that
present a genuine issue worthy of trial.
 
Second, the moving party bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion. This burden always remains with the moving party
and requires the moving party to convince the court that no
genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving
part is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
 
Tri-S Corp. v. W. World Ins. Co., 110 Hawaii 473, 488, 135 P.3d 
82, 97 (2006) (quoting
 French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105
 
Hawai'i 462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 (2004)).'
B. Motion to Compel
 
"We review a trial court's ruling limiting the scope of
 
discovery under the abuse of discretion standard." Fisher v.
 
Grove Farm Co., 123 Hawai 'i 82, 94, 230 P.3d 382, 394 (App. 2009) 
(citing State v. Fukusaku,  85 Hawai 'i 462, 477–78, 946 P.2d 32, 
47–48 (1997)).
 
III. DISCUSSION

 
A. BNYM's Motion for SJ & Writ
 
Lizarraga argues that the circuit court erred when it
 
granted BNYM's Motion for SJ & Writ because genuine issues of fact
 remained as to (1) whether BNYM had the actual and contractual
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authority to foreclose upon the Property; (2) whether the transfer
 
of title to BNYM was void and unenforceable; (3) whether BNYM was
 the holder of the Note with the right to foreclose upon the
 Mortgage; and (4) whether the Note and Mortgage were "procured by
 unfair and deceptive acts and practices."
 
While Lizarraga provides various defenses to summary 
judgment, this court must first determine whether BNYM, the moving party, met its initial burden of production. See Tri-S Corp., 110 
Hawai
'i at 488, 135 P.3d at 97. In order to maintain an ejectment 
action, a plaintiff "must necessarily prove that he or she owns the parcel in issue, meaning that he or she must have the title to and right of possession of such [a] parcel[.]" Kondaur Capital 
Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawai
'i 227, 241, 361 P.3d 454, 468 
(2015) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). When a plaintiff receives title to a property through a quitclaim deed, the legitimacy of plaintiff's title is intertwined with the validity of the foreclosure sale. Id. (noting that "[A] 
quitclaim deed is capable of conveying only that which the predecessor-in-interest already possessed in the first place[.]"); see Hustace v. Kapuni, 6 Haw. App. 241, 245, 718 P.2d 1109, 1112 (1986). In addition, a plaintiff in an ejectment action "must establish that possession is unlawfully withheld by another." Kondaur, 136 Hawai
'i at 241, 361 P.3d at 468) (quoting Carter v. 
Kaikainahaole, 14 Haw. 515, 516 (Haw. Terr. 1902)). 
Kondaur is the most recent Hawai 'i Supreme Court case 
involving an ejectment action after a non-judicial foreclosure. In Kondaur, the mortgagee conducted a non-judicial foreclosure of the mortgagor's property under the power of sale. Kondaur, 136 
Hawai
'i at 230, 136 P.3d at 457. At the foreclosure sale, 
mortgagee was the highest bidder. Id. Subsequent to purchasing 
the property, mortgagee executed a quitclaim deed conveying the property to itself and then gave mortgagor notice to vacate the property. Id. When mortgagor did not vacate the property, 
mortgagee filed a complaint against mortgagor, seeking a judgment for exclusive possession of the property and a writ of possession. Id. at 231, 361 P.3d at 458. Mortgagee filed a motion for summary judgment against mortgagor and attached its affidavit of 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foreclosure under power of sale as "evidence that the power of
 
sale was duly executed." Id. The lower court subsequently
 
granted summary judgment in mortgagee's favor. Id. at 232, 361

 
P.3d at 459.
 
On appeal, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that "the 
duties set forth in Ulrich [v. Sec. Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Haw.
 Terr. 1939)] remain viable law and are applicable to non-judicial
 foreclosure of real property mortgages." Kondaur,
 136 Hawai 'i at 
229, 361 P.3d at 456. The supreme court maintained:
 
Ulrich requires mortgagees to exercise their right to
non-judicial foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner
that is fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and to
demonstrate that an adequate price was procured for the
property [(Ulrich requirements)]. In instances where the
mortgagee assumes the role of a purchaser in a self-dealing
transaction, the burden is on the mortgagee, or its quitclaim
transferee or non-bona fide successor, to establish its
compliance with these obligations. Its failure to do so would
render the foreclosure sale voidable and could therefore be
 set aside at the timely election of the mortgagor.
 
Id. at 240, 361 P.3d at 467 (internal citations and footnotes 
omitted) (citing Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168). The supreme court determined that "the Ulrich requirements are not statutorily or contractually based" but, instead, are "separate and distinct from the requirements of the foreclosure statute and operative mortgage." Kondaur, 136 Hawai
'i at 243, 361 P.3d at 470. 
Consequently, "a mortgagee's minimal adherence to the statutory requirements and the terms of the mortgage . . . does not establish that the foreclosure sale similarly satisfied the Ulrich requirements." Id. 
Applying the Ulrich requirements to the case before it,
 
the supreme court held that the mortgagee's affidavit of
 foreclosure under power of sale did not show that the sale was
 conducted "in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, and in
 good faith" nor did it show that an adequate price was obtained
 for the sale of the property and, thus, mortgagee failed to
 produce evidence that the foreclosure sale satisfied the Ulrich
 requirements. Id. at 243, 361 P.3d at 470. The supreme court
 
held that because mortgagee failed to meet its initial burden of
 proof, summary judgment was erroneously granted in its favor. Id.
 
at 242-44, 361 P.3d at 469-71. 
Similar to the facts in Kondaur, BNYM obtained its
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interest in the Property through a self-dealing transaction and
 
quitclaim deed and, therefore, was required (1) "to introduce
 evidence that [BNYM] exercised its right to non-judicial
 foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner that was fair,
 reasonably diligent, and in good faith" and (2) "to demonstrate
 that an adequate price was procured for the Property." Id. at
 
242, 361 P.3d at 469 (citing Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168). 
In support of its Motion for SJ & Writ, BNYM submitted a 
copy of the Deed and a declaration from its attorney stating that the foreclosure sale complied with HRS § 667-5 through -10 (1993) and the terms of the Mortgage. BNYM's evidence showed minimal adherence to the requirements of the statute and Mortgage; however, BNYM's evidence did not establish that the foreclosure sale satisfied the Ulrich requirements -- i.e., that the sale of the Property was conducted "in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith" and that BNYM procured "an adequate price" for Property. See Kondaur, 136 Hawai
'i at 242, 361 P.3d at 
469. Because BNYM did not provide any evidence that the
 
foreclosure sale complied with the Ulrich requirements, BNYM
 failed to meet its initial burden of production and the burden
 never shifted to Lizarraga to raise genuine issues of material
 fact. See id. The circuit court, therefore, erred in granting
 
summary judgment in BNYM's favor. See id. (holding that summary
 
judgment was inappropriate where mortgagee failed to satisfy its
 initial burden of showing that the foreclosure sale complied with
 the requirements of Ulrich).
5
 
B. Motion to Compel
 
Lizarraga contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in denying his Motion to Compel discovery. Lizarraga
 argues that his "document requests were narrowly tailored to the
 foregoing issues, and were critical to the [c]ircuit [c]ourt's
 determination of whether [BNYM] as Trustee had authority to
 foreclose, whether it had a claim to title and standing to sue as
 a plaintiff herein, and whether a fraud ha[d] been committed." 
5
 Because we hold that BNYM failed to satisfy its initial burden of
production, we need not address the merits of Lizarraga's remaining points on
appeal that challenge the circuit court's Order Granting Motion for SJ & Writ.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The record demonstrates that Lizarraga had sufficient
 
opportunity to conduct discovery, but unduly delayed doing so. 
BNYM filed its Complaint on June 21, 2011. Lizarraga retained
 counsel as early as August 8, 2011 when he filed an answer to the
 Complaint. While BNYM began requesting discovery from Lizarraga
 on October 14, 2011, Lizarraga failed to propound discovery on
 BNYM until February 2, 2012. Notably, Lizarraga did not file his
 Request for Production until after BNYM filed its January 27, 2012
 Motion for SJ & Writ, which was more than seven months after BNYM
 filed its initial Complaint.
 
In addition, many of the documents requested in 
Lizarraga's Request for Production -- such as the documents proving compliance with the Pooling and Serving Agreement (PSA), 
the "complete employment history" of several BNYM signatories, and 
the "original 'wet ink' Note" -- are not relevant to the question of whether BNYM was entitled to summary judgment in its ejectment action. See HRCP Rule 26(b)(1)(A) ("Parties may obtain discovery 
regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action[.]"; See also U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175-76, 338 P.3d 
1185, 1190-91 (App. 2014) (holding that a mortgagor does not have standing to challenge mortgagee's non-compliance with the terms of a PSA); U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Benoist, No. CAAP-14-0001176 at *4 (App. Nov. 12, 2015) (SDO) (holding that "purported use of 'robo-signers' did not prevent [mortgagor] from foreclosing on the [m]ortgage"); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Hensley, No. CAAP-12­0000089 at *3 (App. Mar. 28, 2013) (SDO) (holding that "The Hawai
'i statutes governing non-judicial foreclosure [HRS § 667-5 
to -10] do not expressly require that the foreclosing party produce a physical copy of the original note."). 
"[T]he extent to which discovery is permitted under
 
[HRCP] Rule 26 (as well as Rules 33 and 34) is subject to
 considerable latitude and the discretion of the trial court." 
Wakabayashi v. Hertz Corp., 66 Haw. 265, 275, 660 P.2d 1309, 1315­16 (1983) (brackets omitted); see Hensley, SDO at *3. Given
 Lizarraga's delay, the nature of Lizarraga's requested discovery,
 and the circuit court's discretion, the circuit court did not
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
abuse its discretion when it denied Lizarraga's Motion to Compel.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we vacate the Circuit Court of the Fifth
 
Circuit's (1) June 13, 2012 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession Filed January 27, 2012;"
 (2) June 13, 2012 "Judgment for Possession;" and (3) September 18,
 2012 "Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Rehearing of
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession
 Filed January 27, 2012, and Defendant's Motion to Compel Plaintiff
 to Produce Documents Filed March 21, 2012 and/or for
 Reconsideration of this Court's May 1, 2012 Decision to Grant
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Deny Defendant's
 Motion to Compel Filed on May 22, 2012," except that we affirm the
 circuit court's denial of Lizarraga's Motion to Compel. This case
 is remanded for proceedings consistent with this Memorandum
