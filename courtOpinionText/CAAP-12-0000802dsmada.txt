IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
HAWAIIAN PARADISE PARK OWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC.,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MANGO ACRES TRUST, PETER FRONT TRUSTEE,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
PUNA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3RC-12-1-456)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Peter Frost's April 19, 2013
 
response to this court's April 9, 2013 order to show cause why
 
the appeal should not be dismissed, and the record, it appears as
 follows.
 
1. Peter Frost (Frost) filed the instant appeal
 
purportedly on behalf of Defendant-Appellant Mango Acres Trust

(Trust) as its manager and/or trustee. However, the record 
reflects that throughout the duration of the case in the District Court of the Third Circuit (district court), Frost did not obtain 
1
the permission of the district court  to intervene in this casepursuant to Rule 24 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and has not demonstrated his standing to appeal. Abaya v. 
Mantell, 112 Hawai' i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006)(standing 
generally requires that the person was a party to the action, and non-parties who could not intervene are ordinarily denied standing to appeal). 
2. Even if Frost were the manager and/or trustee of
 
the Trust, Frost would not be qualified to represent the Trust in
 the appeal or in the underlying district court case because Frost
 
2
is not licensed to practice law as an attorney in Hawai' i  and
has not demonstrated that he is the real party in interest by introducing in the district court or this court the unrecorded Trust document showing that he is the sole beneficiary of the trust.

3. Where Frost has demonstrated no standing to
 
represent the Trust in any judicial proceeding, including but not
 limited to appeal, this court has no jurisdiction to take action
 on the merits of this appeal, and only may take action to assess

its jurisdiction on the matter.4 Thus, this court has no
 
recourse but to dismiss the instant appeal where it lacks
 
jurisdiction because Frost has no standing to appeal. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the appeal is dismissed. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 7, 2013.

 [J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original
action. Appellate courts, upon determining that they
lack jurisdiction shall not require anything other
than a dismissal of the appeal or action. Without
jurisdiction, a court is not in a position to consider
the case further. Thus, appellate courts have an
obligation to insure that they have jurisdiction to
hear and determine each case. The lack of subject
matter jurisdiction can never be waived by any party
at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua
sponte, dismiss that appeal.
