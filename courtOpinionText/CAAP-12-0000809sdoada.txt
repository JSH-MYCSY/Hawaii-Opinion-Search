SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Greg W. Schoenlein appeals from 
the "Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order 
Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing" entered March 12, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1 
(circuit court) denying his Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

 The Honorable Steven S. Alm presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
On May 10, 2011, Schoenlein filed a Petition for Post 
Conviction Relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. Schoenlein claimed relief on the grounds of unlawful sentence. He alleged that the minimum sentence calculated by the Hawai' i Paroling Authority 
(HPA) was improper and that his sentence in CR. No. 05-1-2431 should not have been consecutive to his sentence in CR. No. 04-1-2287. 
The circuit court imposed a sentence of five years
 
imprisonment for Schoenlein's sole count of theft in the second
 degree in CR. No. 04-1-2287; and in CR. No. 05-1-2431, imposed a
 sentence of five years for his one count of escape in the second
 degree and ten years for his one count of escape in the first
 degree to run concurrently with each other but consecutive to the
 sentence in CR. No. 04-1-2287 and any other sentence imposed in
 his cases in Michigan.
 
Schoenlein argues the Department of Public Safety 
and/or the HPA have not properly credited him with the
 presentence detention that he served. Schoenlein claims that his
 presentence credit for time served should be applied to both
 sentences in CR. Nos. 04-1-2287 and 05-1-2431.
 
In State v. Tauiliili, 96 Hawai' i 195, 29 P.3d 914 
(2001), the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that in the imposition of 
consecutive sentences, presentence credit time is only granted once against the aggregate of the consecutive sentences. The

supreme court stated that "when consecutive sentences are 
imposed, credit for presentence imprisonment is properly granted against only the aggregate of the consecutive sentence terms." Tauiliili, 96 Hawai' i at 199, 29 P.3d at 918. This is what HPA 
did in this case. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the March 12, 2012 "Amended
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition
 for Post-Conviction Relief Without a Hearing" entered in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
