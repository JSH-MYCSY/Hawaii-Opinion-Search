NO. CAAP-12-0000812
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF
 
V.G.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-J NO. 0089867)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant V.G. appeals from the September 28,
 
2011 "Decree RE: Law Violation Petition(s)" of the Family Court
 
1
of the First Circuit  (family court).
On appeal, V.G. contends there was no substantial
 
evidence to support the family court's finding that he was a law
 
violator as to the sexual assault in the third degree charge
 (Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2012)), in
 that he did not knowingly make sexual contact with the
 complaining witness (CW).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude V.G.'s
 appeal is without merit.

HRS § 707–732(1)(b) provides that "[a] person commits
 
the offense of sexual assault in the third degree if . . . [t]he
 
person knowingly subjects to sexual contact another person who is
 less than fourteen years old or causes such a person to have
 sexual contact with the person[.]" HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2012)
 defines "Sexual contact" as 
any touching, other than acts of "sexual penetration," of
the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married
to the actor, or of the sexual or other intimate parts of
the actor by the person, whether directly or through the
clothing or other material intended to cover the sexual or
other intimate parts.
 
The test on appeal in reviewing the legal sufficiency 
of the evidence is whether, when viewing the evidence in the 
light most favorable to the government, substantial evidence exists to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. State v. 
Pone, 78 Hawai
'i 262, 265, 892 P.2d 455, 458 (1995). 
The evidence, in the light most favorable to the
 
government, was that while CW was on his back, V.G. straddled CW
 and squatted up and down over CW's face such that V.G.'s clothed
 penis touched CW's forehead. The incident began when V.G. was
 chasing CW around the field. CW became tired, stopped running,
 sat down, and laid on his back. CW believed V.G. would stop
 chasing him. V.G. stood over CW with his feet on either side of
 CW and "said suck it or something like that[,]" and began
 "squatting up and down." CW felt V.G's shorts touch him and felt
 V.G.'s penis on his forehead.
 
V.G's conduct of straddling CW, squatting up and down 
over CW's head, telling CW to "suck it," and touching CW's forehead with his clothed penis infers V.G. was aware of what he was doing. The evidence demonstrated V.G's intent to engage in conduct which resulted in his clothed penis touching CW's forehead. Unlike the horseplay involved in State v. Silver, 125 Hawai
'i 1, 249 P.3d 1141 (2011), the testimony and context in 
this case established sufficient evidence to support the family court's determination that V.G. violated HRS § 707-732(1)(b). 
Therefore,
