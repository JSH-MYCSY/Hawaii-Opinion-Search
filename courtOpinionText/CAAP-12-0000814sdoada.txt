v.
 
BRADFORD B.L. LING, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-12-00083)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Bradford B.L. Ling (Ling) appeals
 
from the Judgment entered on August 27, 2012, in the District
 
Court of the Third Circuit (District Court).1 Ling was convicted
 
of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant
 (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013).
2 We affirm.
 
A police officer observed Ling's vehicle swerving while
 
traveling in two lanes. The officer stopped Ling's vehicle and
 
1The Honorable Andrew P. Wilson presided.
 
2HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
. . .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath[.]

subsequently arrested Ling for OVUII. After placing Ling under
 
arrest, the officer read to Ling a form entitled "Use of
 Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent for
 Testing" (Implied Consent Form). Ling agreed to take a breath
 test, which showed that he had a breath alcohol concentration of
 .183 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath -- a concentration
 that exceeded the legal limit. Ling moved to suppress the
 results of his breath test, and his motion was denied by the
 District Court.
 
On appeal, Ling challenges the District Court's denial
 
of his motion to suppress. Ling argues that: (1) because the
 police failed to give him Miranda warnings before reading the
 Implied Consent Form to him and obtaining his decision on
 testing, the results of his breath test should have been
 suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation; and (2) the
 results of his breath test should have been suppressed because
 the police misinformed him of his statutory right to an attorney
 under HRS § 803-9 (1993). 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, No. CAAP-12-0000858, --- Hawai
'i ---, --- P.3d ---, 2014 WL 
1270615 (Hawai 'i App. Mar. 28, 2014) (as amended on May 2, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Ling's motion to suppress, and we affirm the District Court's Judgment.
