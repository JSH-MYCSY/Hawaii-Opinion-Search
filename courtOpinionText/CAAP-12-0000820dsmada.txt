NO. CAAP-12-0000820
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
LISA DURDA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. ION GENIUS INC., et. al.,
Appellants-Defendants and Third-Party Plaintiffs, v. GENA
COSTALES, Third-Party Defendant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0241-02 (KKS))
 
ORDER GRANTING NOVEMBER 1, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Lisa Durda's
 
(Appellee Durda) November 1, 2012 motion to dismiss appellate
 
court case number CAAP-12-0000820 for lack of jurisdiction,
 
(2)
 Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant Ion Genius, Inc.'s
 
(Appellant Ion Genius), November 12, 2012 memorandum in
 opposition to Appellee Durda's November 1, 2012 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000820 for lack of
 
jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over Appellant Ion Genius's appeal from the
 
Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's July 11, 2012 "Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law and Order" (the July 11, 2012 order).
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2011) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS 
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules 
of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawaif i holds "[a]n appeal may 
be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and 
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaif i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all 
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawaif i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the 
time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." 
Jenkins, 76 Hawaif i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-12­0000820 was filed on November 20, 2012, and the circuit court has 
not yet entered a separate judgment that resolves all claims 
against all parties. 
Absent a separate judgment, the July 11, 2012 order is 
not eligible for appellate review. Although exceptions to the 
final judgment requirement exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 
201 (1848), (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, 
and HRS § 641-1(b), the July 11, 2012 order does not satisfy the 
requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the 
collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawaif i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawaif i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order 
doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an 
appeal from an interlocutory order). Therefore, Appellant Ion

Genius's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction
 
over appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000820. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Durda's November 1,
 
2012 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12­
0000820 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court
 
case number CAAP-12-0000820 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaif i, November 29, 2012.
