IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
RODNEY KELLEY, Petitioner-Appellant, v. ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR
OF THE COURTS, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DAA-12-0010)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Rodney Alan Kelley (Kelley)
 
appeals from the Judgment on Appeal, entered on September 24,
 
2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 
Division (District Court).1
 
On appeal, Kelley contends the District Court erred by
 
affirming the Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office's
 
(ADLRO) administrative revocation of his driver's license because
 
(1) a sworn statement by Officer Lou Kang (Officer Kang) did not
 
comply with Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-36(a)(2)(B)
 
because he was not the person responsible for maintenance of the
 
Intoxilyzer testing equipment and the sworn statement failed to
 
comply with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2)(C) because it did not state that
 
the equipment was properly maintained. Kelley contends these
 
deficiencies deprived the ADLRO of jurisdiction to revoke his
 
license via the Administrative Review Decision. Kelley also

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claims that (2) the Notice of Administrative Revocation was not
 
issued by the arresting officer, as required by HRS § 291E-33(a),
 
(3) there was no probable cause to believe that Kelley was
 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant because
 
his arrest was unreasonable, and (4) his requests to issue
 
subpoenas duces tecum were improperly denied.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kelley's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The sworn statement by Officer Kang fulfilled the
 
requirements of HRS § 291E-36(a)(2)(B) and (C) (2007). Park v.
 
Tanaka, 75 Haw. 271, 275-78, 859 P.2d 917, 920-21 (1993).
 
(2) Neither the plain language nor legislative history
 
of HRS § 291E-33 (2007 and Supp. 2011) supports Kelley's claim
 that the arresting officer must also issue the Notice of
 
Administrative Revocation. 
"[O]ur foremost obligation," when interpreting a statute,
"is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is obtained primarily from the languagecontained in the statute itself." State v. Aluli, 78 
Hawai'i 317, 320, 893 P.2d 168, 171 (1995) (citation
omitted). "[T]he courts may resort to extrinsic aids indetermining the legislative intent. One avenue is the use of legislative history as an interpretive tool." State v. 
Toyomura, 80 Hawai' i 8, 19, 904 P.2d 893, 904 (1995)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).Furthermore, "[t]he legislature is presumed not to intend anabsurd result, and legislation will be construed to avoid,if possible, inconsistency, contradiction[,] andillogicality." State v. Malufau, 80 Hawai' i 126, 137, 906
P.2d 612, 623 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marksomitted). 
State v. Griffin, 83 Hawai 'i 105, 108 n.4, 924 P.2d 1211, 1214 
n.4 (1996). 
The plain language of HRS § 291E-33 distinguishes
 
between an "arresting law enforcement officer" and a "law
 
enforcement officer." Section 291E-33(a), HRS simply directs a
 
law enforcement officer to act after an arresting law enforcement
 
officer has made an arrest. HRS § 291E-33(b) requires a law
 
enforcement officer to issue a Notice of Administrative
 
Revocation if there is probable cause to believe a person being
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
treated in a hospital or medical facility has violated section
 
291E-61 or 291E-61.5 but does not require that the person be
 
arrested by the same law enforcement officer. On the other hand,
 
HRS § 291E-33(c) specifically directs an "arresting law
 
enforcement officer" to perform specific actions such as taking
 
possession of a motor vehicle registration and license plates. 
The plain language of HRS § 291E-33 is clear that the terms
 
"arresting law enforcement officer" and "law enforcement officer"
 
are not synonymous. A "law enforcement officer" need not be an
 
"arresting law enforcement officer."
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes § 286-255 (Supp. 2000) governed
 
the issuance of a Notice of Administrative Revocation prior to
 
its repeal in 2002 and re-enactment as HRS § 291E-33 by Act 189
 
(2000). HRS § 286-255 stated:
 
§286-255 Arrest; procedures.  (a) Whenever a person is
arrested for a violation of section 291-4 or 291-4.4, on a
determination by the arresting officer that:
 
(1)	 There was reasonable suspicion to stop the motor
vehicle, or that the motor vehicle was stopped
at an intoxication and drug control roadblock
established and operated in compliance with
sections 286-162.5 and 286-162.6; and
 
(2)	 There was probable cause to believe that the
arrestee was driving, operating, or in actual
physical control of the motor vehicle while
under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
 
the arresting officer immediately shall take possession of
any license held by the person and request the arrestee to
take a test for alcohol concentration. The arresting officer
shall inform the person that the person has the option to
take a breath test, a blood test, or both. The arresting
officer also shall inform the person of the sanctions under
this part, including the sanction for refusing to take a
breath or a blood test. Thereafter, the arresting officer
shall complete and issue to the arrestee a notice of
administrative revocation and shall indicate thereon whether
 the notice shall serve as a temporary driver's permit. The
notice shall serve as a temporary driver's permit, unless,
at the time of arrest, the arrestee was unlicensed, the
arrestee's license was revoked or suspended, or the arrestee
had no license in the arrestee's possession.
 
(b) Whenever the police determine that, as the result of a
blood test performed pursuant to section 286-163(b) and (c),
there is probable cause to believe that a person being
treated in a hospital or medical facility has violated
section 291-4, the police shall complete and issue to the
person a notice of administrative revocation and shall
indicate thereon whether the notice shall serve as a
 temporary driver's permit. The notice shall serve as a

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
temporary driver's permit unless, at the time the notice was
issued, the person was unlicensed, the person's license was
revoked or suspended, or the person had no license in the
person's possession.
 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 286-255(a) specifically required that an
 
"arresting officer" issue a Notice of Administrative Revocation. 
The re-enactment of HRS § 291E-33(a) eliminated the requirement
 
that an arresting officer also issue the Notice of Administrative
 
Revocation and allowed any "law enforcement officer" to issue a
 
notice. Thus, the legislative history does not support Kelley's
 
claim. Kelley does not dispute that a law enforcement officer
 
issued a Notice of Administrative Revocation to him. Therefore,
 
the notice was properly issued to him.
 
(3) Kelley failed to show where in record he objected
 
to the consideration of the Preliminary Alcohol Screening (PAS)
 
result in a probable cause determination by the hearing officer. 
There are no written motions by Kelley in the ADLRO record. The
 
only transcript provided in the record on appeal is of March 20,
 
2012. It shows that Officer Raynette Ho (Officer Ho) was
 
questioned about her administration of the PAS to Kelley, but
 
does not show that Kelley specifically objected to the PAS for
 
failure to comply with HRS § 291E-36(a)(2), that the PAS was
 
administered so much later than the field sobriety test so as to
 
make Kelley's detention an unreasonable seizure, or that no
 
reasonable person would rely upon the PAS. The Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Decision by the hearing officer merely
 
states that "Counsel moved to reverse the revocation on the
 
grounds that . . . . (2) without the sworn statement of [Officer
 
Ross Malloy (Officer Malloy)], who administered the field
 
sobriety tests, there is insufficient evidence to prove probable
 
cause; . . . ." Without an objection to the hearing officer that
 
the PAS should have been excluded, it was properly considered as
 
evidence of probable cause that Kelley operated a vehicle while
 
under the influence of an intoxicant.
 
Kelley does not challenge the hearing officer's
 
findings that Kelley was speeding at 40 miles per hour in a 25
 
mile per hour zone when he was stopped for speeding, Kelley
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
admitted that he drank "a couple" of beers, Kelley's eyes
 
appeared glassy and red, and Sergeant Paul Lucas (Sergeant Lucas)
 
detected a strong odor of alcohol on Kelley's breath. The PAS
 
result also indicated that Kelley's breath alcohol content was
 
0.176, well in excess of 0.08 needed to be charged with violating
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2014). The traffic violation and the
 
totality of the circumstances provided a reasonable factual basis
 
to believe that Kelley had committed the crime of OVUII. Kernan
 
v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 39, 856 P.2d 1207, 1226 (1993).
 
(4) The ADLRO should issue all requested subpoenas, 
unless the witness does not possess any relevant evidence or the subpoena request is otherwise deficient, to ensure an arrestee's 
rights are adequately protected. Biscoe v. Tanaka, 76 Hawai
'i 
380, 385, 878 P.2d 719, 724 (1994) ("If a proper request is made for a subpoena for a relevant witness, the refusal to issue the 
subpoena would constitute an abuse of discretion."). However, a 
policy of initially denying a prehearing subpoena request and 
making a relevancy determination at the first scheduled hearing 
does not violate due process. Simmons v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Courts, 88 Hawai
'i 55, 961 P.2d 620 (1998). "[I]t is often 
difficult, if not impossible, for a hearing officer to make a 
prehearing determination from the face of a subpoena request 
whether a certain witness possesses relevant evidence." Id. at 
64, 961 P.2d at 629. 
The record on appeal does not contain any objection to
 
the denial of Kelley's subpoena duces tecum requests or attempt
 to explain the relevance of the items he sought. In addition,
 
the appellate court, having the benefit of hindsight, can
 
determine the information sought from Sergeant Lucas and Officer
 
Ho was not relevant. See Id. Sergeant Lucas and Officer Ho did
 
not perform field sobriety tests on Kelley. Therefore, a
 subpoena duces tecum to Sergeant Lucas and Officer Ho to bring
 
all documents and information relating to field sobriety testing
 
was not relevant.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Officer Ho performed a PAS on Kelley. The PAS is not
 
premised on the relationship between intoxication and loss of
 
coordination; it is based solely upon breath alcohol content. 
The hearing officer excluded Officer Malloy's report and did not
 
rely upon Kelley's field sobriety test results in affirming his
 
license revocation. Thus, even if Officer Malloy should have
 
been ordered to produce the information regarding field sobriety
 
testing, it was harmless error to deny the requested subpoena
 
duces tecum to Officer Malloy. The hearing officer also did not
 
rely upon the Intoxilyzer test results. Thus, even if Officers
 
Kang and Miki should have been ordered to produce the information
 
requested pertaining to the use and maintenance of the
 
Intoxilyzer, it was harmless error to deny the requested
 
subpoenas duces tecum.2
 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment on Appeal,
 
entered on September 24, 2012, in the District Court of the First
 Circuit, Honolulu Division, is affirmed.

 Kelley also argues that the Hearing Officer failed to identify the
evidence he relied upon in denying Kelley's motion to rescind. As we have
 
already decided with regard to Kelley's first point, the sworn statement of
Officer Kang satisfied HRS § 291E-36.
 
Kelley's argument that the Hearing Officer "completely ignored"
Kelley's arguments is without merit.
