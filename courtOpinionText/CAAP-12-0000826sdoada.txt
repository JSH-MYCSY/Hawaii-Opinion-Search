OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
HUI Z. CHEN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
THOMAS J. HOEFLINGER, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 05-1-0279)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 Plaintiff-Appellant Hui Z. Chen ("Chen") appeals from
 
the September 17, 2012 Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for an
 
Order to Mark Related Above-Captioned Files As "Confidential"
 Including Opinion of the Intermediate Court of Appeals on
 March 9, 2012, S.C. No. 28808 Filed September 4, 2012, ("Order
 Denying Motion to Mark Appellate Case as Confidential") entered
 in the Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family Court").

On March 9, 2012, this court issued a published opinion 
("Opinion") in appellate case number 28808 ("Appellate Case"), which vacated several findings in Family Court case number FC-D No. 05-1-279 ("Family Court Case") and remanded the case for further proceedings. Chen v. Hoeflinger, 127 Hawai
'i 346, 368, 
279 P.3d 11, 33 (App. 2012). On May 11, 2012, this court issued its corresponding judgment ("Judgment"). On July 19, 2012, and again on July 27, 2012, Chen filed motions with this court to have the Appellate Case records sealed, including the Opinion.

 The Honorable Ben H. Gaddis presided.

On August 6, 2012, this court issued a pair of orders denying 
those motions for want of jurisdiction, citing the Hawai 'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") as terminating this court's jurisdiction and returning jurisdiction to the lower court upon the thirty-first day after entry of the Judgment. 
On August 2, 2012, the Family Court ordered the Family
 
Court Case file sealed.
2 On September 4, 2012, Chen filed a
 
motion with the Family Court to have the Appellate Case file,
 including the Opinion, marked as confidential ("Motion to Mark
 Appellate Case as Confidential"). Despite the Family Court's
 decision to mark the Family Court Case file as confidential, the
 appellate decision remained readily accessible online. Because
 of the Appellate Case's close relation to the Family Court Case,
 Chen argues, the appellate decision and the Appellate Case file
 should be treated similarly. 
On September 17, 2012, the Family Court issued its
 
Order Denying Motion to Mark Appellate Case as Confidential. The
 corresponding minutes from the hearing explained that this court
 had elected to publish the Opinion without keeping certain
 information confidential, and that the Family Court "does not
 have the power to cancel the publication or is not sure if it can
 be done[, as] these cases go into the books for publication[.]" 
On September 28, 2012, Chen timely appealed from the
 
Order Denying Motion to Mark Appellate Case as Confidential. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Chen's point of error as follows:
 
As a threshold matter, Chen's opening brief largely 
fails to conform with HRAP Rule 28(b). Nevertheless, given our policy of "permit[ting] litigants . . . to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible," we proceed to address the merits of Chen's appeal. O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai
'i 
383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994).

 That order was subsequently vacated by the Family Court.

The Family Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Chen's Motion to Mark Appellate Case as Confidential. 
Chen grounded her motion, as well as this appeal, in Rule 9 of the Hawai
'i Court Records Rules ("HCRR").3 She fails, however, 
to explain how HCRR Rule 9 guides, compels, or even permits a lower court to order that an appellate case file be marked confidential. As we find no authority therein or elsewhere that would permit the Family Court to have ruled in Chen's favor, we hold that the Family Court did not abuse its discretion. See 
Haw. Ct. Rec. R. 9. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the September 17, 2012 Order
 
Denying Plaintiff's Motion for an Order to Mark Related Above-
Captioned Files As "Confidential" Including Opinion of the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals on March 9, 2012, S.C. No. 28808
 Filed September 4, 2012, in the Family Court of the Third Circuit
 is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, February 7, 2014.

 Chen has subsequently filed a similar motion in appellate case
number CAAP-13-0000034. On February 4, 2014, that motion was denied without
prejudice to Chen filing a timely motion with enough specificity to permit the
court to rule.
