appeals from a September 18, 2012 final judgment entered in the
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit1
 (circuit court) in favor of
Defendants-Appellees Aqua Hotels and Resorts, Inc. (Aqua Hotels)
 
and Kai Management Services, LLC (Kai Management) (collectively,
 
Defendants). The circuit court granted summary judgment in
 
Defendants' favor on all counts of Plaintiff's complaint. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff was employed as the Director of Sales and
 
Marketing (DOSM) at the Kauai Beach Resort (KBR) from 2006
 
through 2009 by Anekona LLC. In 2009, Anekona LLC filed for
 
bankruptcy, and on July 24, 2009, Kai Management assumed
 
management responsibilities for KBR and absorbed all existing
 
employees of KBR, including Plaintiff. 
Kai Management is a
 
wholly owned subsidiary of Aqua Hotels. Throughout her
 employment at KBR, Plaintiff had a house on Oahu and returned to
 
Oahu during weekends. KBR provided her with a room in the hotel
 
during the week and paid for her weekly round-trip airfare.
 
On June 29, 2010, Robin Graf (Graf), the general
 
manager of KBR, met with Plaintiff and informed her that at the
 
end of August KBR would no longer pay for her weekly travel and
 
hotel accommodations. At the time, KBR was restructuring after
 
undergoing foreclosure in 2009, and Graf stated the decision was
 
a cost-cutting measure and not a performance issue. He further
 
stated Plaintiff's job was not being eliminated but because the
 
hotel wanted a DOSM who lived on Kauai, Plaintiff would need to
 
relocate from Oahu to continue her employment. Plaintiff said
 
she did not plan to move to Kauai. During this conversation,
 
Graf learned that Plaintiff was 64 years old. 
On July 30, 2010, Graf sent Plaintiff a letter
 
confirming their conversation. He asked that she respond by
 
August 2 with "[her] intentions in regards to performing and
 
fulfilling [her] job responsibilities should [she] not decide to
 
relocate to Kauai." Plaintiff responded accordingly by email on

 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
August 2, 2010, informing Graf that she intended to relocate to
 
Kauai and continue her employment, and she agreed to the
 
elimination of her commuting benefits. Plaintiff copied her
 
email to Guy Underkoffler (Underkoffler), Senior Vice-President
 
of Operations for Aqua Hotels and Chief Operating Officer of KBR,
 
and Sanford Nojima (Nojima), Director of Human Resources for
 
Aqua.
 
The next day, Graf emailed Nojima, Underkoffler, and
 
Shanamae Andres (Andres), KBR's human resources manager,
 
confirming Plaintiff's decision to relocate. Graf also raised
 
the need to redefine the DOSM position as part of KBR's overall
 
restructuring. Specifically, the email proposed a redefined job
 
description that eliminated marketing responsibility from the
 
position, emphasized local sales, and reduced the position's
 
salary. 
Graf drafted a letter to Plaintiff dated August 5, 2010
 
summarizing the changes and changing the job title to Director of
 
Sales (DOS). Graf wrote he would discuss his expectations with
 
Plaintiff after she reviewed the job description. Graf later
 
testified he could not recall whether he sent this letter to
 
Plaintiff, however.
 
On August 12, 2010, Graf met with Plaintiff and
 
informed her he was eliminating the DOSM position, and her
 
employment would terminate at the end of the month. He stated
 
Plaintiff could apply for the DOS position but would have to
 
start as a new hire. Plaintiff did not apply for the DOS
 
position, and on November 2, 2010, KBR hired a 52-year old woman
 
to fill the position.
 
On February 7, 2011, Plaintiff jointly filed a 
complaint alleging age discrimination with the federal Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hawai' i Civil 
Rights Commission (HCRC). Plaintiff named Kai Management as the respondent in both complaints and alleged she was terminated 
because of her age. On March 22, 2011, the HCRC issued a notice 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4of right to sue to Plaintiff, based on her election to pursue her
claims in court.
On April 5, 2011, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants in the circuit court.  The complaint alleged a claim
for age discrimination in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 378-2(1)(A) (Supp. 2010) and a claim for intentional
infliction of emotional distress (IIED) arising out of her
termination.
Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on May
3, 2012.  The circuit court granted the motion and dismissed
Plaintiff's claims, concluding: (1) it lacked jurisdiction over
Plaintiff's claims against Aqua Hotels because Plaintiff had
failed to name Aqua Hotels in her complaint with the HCRC; (2)
although Plaintiff established a prima facie showing of age
discrimination, Defendants stated legitimate reasons for
Plaintiff's termination, and Plaintiff had not produced evidence
that Defendants' reasons were a pretext for discrimination; and
(3) Plaintiff failed to produce evidence on her IIED claim.  The
circuit court entered its order granting Defendants' motion for
summary judgment on August 21, 2012 and entered its final
judgment on September 18, 2012.
On appeal, Plaintiff contends the circuit court erred
in concluding it lacked jurisdiction over Aqua Hotels and in
granting summary judgment on her HRS § 378-2 claim and her IIED
claim.
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
A. Jurisdiction
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that [the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong
standard."  Captain Andy's Sailing, Inc., v. Dep't of Land and
Natural Resources, State of Hawai# i, 113 Hawai# i 184, 192, 150
P.3d 833, 841 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citation and
brackets omitted).FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5B. Summary Judgment
A grant of summary judgment is "appropriate where
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." 
Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co., 76 Hawai# i 454, 457, 879 P.2d
1037, 1040 (1994) (citing S. Utsunomiya Enters., Inc. v.
Moomuku Country Club,
 75 Haw. 480, 497, 866 P.2d 951, 961,)
reconsideration denied, 76 Hawai# i 247, 75 Haw. 580, 871
P.2d 795 (1994).  In other words, "summary judgment should
not be granted unless the entire record shows a right to
judgment with such clarity as to leave no room for
controversy and establishes affirmatively that the adverse
party cannot prevail under any circumstances."  State v.
Zimring, 52 Haw. 472, 475, 479 P.2d 202, 204 (1970) (quoting
Phoenix Sav. & Loan, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co.,
381 F.2d 245, 249 (4th Cir.1967)).  "A fact is material if
proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or
refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action
or defense asserted by the parties."  Hulsman v. Hemmeter
Dev. Corp., 65 Haw. 58, 61, 647 P.2d 713, 716 (1982)

III.  DISCUSSION
A. Jurisdiction Over Aqua Hotels
A person who wishes to file a judicial proceeding in
the circuit court for employment discrimination in a violation of
Part I of HRS Chapter 378 (1993) must first file a complaint with
the HCRC and receive a notice of right to sue from the HCRC.  See
Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai# i 408, 416
n.5, 32 P.3d 52, 60 n.5 (2001).  Plaintiff's complaint with the
HCRC named only Kai Management as a respondent.  The circuit
court dismissed Plaintiff's claims against Aqua Hotels for lack
of jurisdiction, based on her failure to name Aqua Hotels in her
HCRC complaint.
This court addressed a somewhat similar situation in
Lales v. Wholesale Motors Co. , No. 28516 (App. May 9, 2012)
(mem.), cert. granted, 2012 WL 4801373 (Oct. 9, 2012).2  The
plaintiff in Lales filed a complaint with the HCRC naming his
employer and his supervisor as respondents; however, the HCRC
2The petitioners' application for writ of certiorari in Lales did not
raise the specific issue that we discuss here.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
issued a notice of right to sue naming only the employer. Id. at
 
*6. We noted federal courts have permitted suits under Title VII
 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000e et seq.)
 
(Title VII) "even where a party is not named in an EEOC
 
charge, . . . as long as the party not named in the EEOC charge
 
was involved in the acts giving rise to the EEOC charge or should
 
have anticipated that the claimant would name the party in a
 
Title VII lawsuit." Id. at *8 (emphasis added). We concluded
 
that under the circumstances the plaintiff could proceed with his
 suit against his supervisor.
 
Although this case is distinguishable because Plaintiff 
did not name Aqua Hotels in her HCRC complaint, the reasoning set 
forth in Lales applies here. In interpreting our employment 
discrimination law, our courts look to interpretations of 
analogous federal laws by the federal courts for guidance. 
Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 425-26, 32 P.3d at 69-70 (adopting the 
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' test regarding retaliation claims under Title VII). The Ninth Circuit has identified several 
exceptions to the general rule that a party not named in an EEOC 
charge cannot be sued under Title VII. Suit is permitted against 
the unnamed party when: (1) the unnamed party was involved in the 
acts giving rise to the EEOC charge; (2) the EEOC or the unnamed 
party should have anticipated a Title VII suit against the 
unnamed party; (3) the named party is a principal or agent of a 
unnamed party or if they are substantially identical; (4) the 
EEOC could have inferred that the unnamed party violated Title 
VII; or (5) the unnamed party had notice of the EEOC conciliation 
efforts and participated in the EEOC proceedings. Sosa v. 
Hiraoka, 920 F.2d 1451, 1458-60 (9th Cir. 1990). 
We hold that the exceptions enumerated above apply when
 
determining whether a plaintiff may proceed with a suit for
 violations of Part I of HRS Chapter 378 against a party not named
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in an HCRC charge. Although the federal circuits have applied 
various tests and exceptions, see Martin v. Fisher, 13 Cal. Rptr. 
2d 922, 424 (Cal Ct. App. 1992), we specifically adopt the Ninth 
Circuit's analysis because its precedent applies to EEOC 
complaints jointly filed with the HCRC; adopting its precedent 
would therefore be consistent with the legislature's intention of 
providing employment discrimination victims with the same 
remedies under state and federal law. Sam Teague, Ltd. v. 
Hawai'i Civil Rights Comm'n, 89 Hawai' i 269, 281, 971 P.2d 1104, 
1116 (1999) (citing Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 549, in 1981 House 
Journal, at 1166; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1109, in 1981 Senate 
Journal, at 1363). The Ninth Circuit's analysis is also 
consistent with the remedial purposes of Part I of HRS Chapter 
378 and with our courts' policy of favoring adjudication of 
discrimination claims on the merits. Lales at *7; Furukawa v. 
Honolulu Zoological Soc'y, 85 Hawai' i 7, 17, 936 P.2d 643, 653 
(1997); Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co. (Hawai' i) Ltd., Inc., 76 
Hawai'i 454, 462, 879 P.2d 1037, 1045 (1994). States construing 
their respective employment discrimination statutory schemes have 
similarly adopted federal precedent. Martin, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 
923-24; Johns v. Harborage I, Ltd., 585 N.W.2d 853, 860 (Minn. Ct. App. 1998) (applying Sosa to its interpretation of the 
Minnesota Human Rights Act). 
Therefore, we apply the factors set forth in Sosa to
 
this case, and we conclude Plaintiff should have been allowed to
 
proceed with her suit against Aqua Hotels. Plaintiff's employer,
 
Kai Management, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aqua Hotels. The
 
record shows Aqua Hotels management officials were involved in
 
Plaintiff's termination, and Aqua Hotels charged Graf with
 
responsibility for KBR's restructuring decisions. The record
 
also shows Aqua Hotels was notified of and served with
 
Plaintiff's HCRC complaint. Thus, Aqua Hotels should clearly

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3The circuit court also erred in dismissing Plaintiff's IIED claim
against Aqua Hotels based on her failure to name Aqua Hotels in her HCRC
complaint.  The IIED claim was a separate claim independent of Plaintiff's
HRS § 378-2 claim and was not subject to the statutory provisions that require
filing an HCRC complaint before filing suit.  See Hac v. Univ. of Hawai# i, 102
Hawai#i 92, 104, 73 P.3d 46, 58 (2003) (recognizing IIED as an independent
claim).  However, we conclude the court's error was harmless.  Plaintiff's IIED
claim against the two Defendants was based on the same allegations, and as
discussed further below, we conclude Defendants' actions did not rise to the
level necessary for an IIED claim to go forward. 
4Defendants argue that, rather than applying the McDonnell Douglas
framework, this court should evaluate Plaintiff's claim by applying Gross v.
FBL Financial Services, Inc.
, 557 U.S. 167 (2009).  In Gross, the United
States Supreme Court held that a plaintiff bringing a disparate treatment
claim under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA)
must prove her employer would not have taken the challenged action but for the
plaintiff's age.  However, Gross was a "mixed-motive" case, and as the Hawai# i
Supreme Court stated, the mixed-motive and McDonnell-Douglas analyses are
different and distinct methods of proving disparate treatment.  Shoppe, 94
Hawai
#i at 378, 14 P.3d at 1059.  The mixed-motive analysis requires that the
plaintiff produce direct evidence of discriminatory animus.  See Id. at 381,
14 P.3d at 1062 (concluding supervisor's comment that employer was "aiming for
a younger look" amounted to direct evidence of discrimination); French v.
Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc.,
 105 Hawai# i 462, 474-75, 99 P.3d 1046, 1058-59 (2004). 
Because Plaintiff did not present direct evidence, this case was not a mixed-
motive case, and we conclude Gross does not apply.  See also Shelley v. Geren,
666 F.3d 599, 606-08 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that even in ADEA cases governed
by Gross, the McDonnell Douglas framework applies when analyzing ADEA
"pretext" claims at the summary judgment stage).
8have anticipated that Plaintiff would name them in a suit. 
Moreover, Aqua Hotels could not have been prejudiced in any way
because there were no HCRC proceedings.  The circuit court erred
in dismissing Plaintiff's HRS § 378-2 claim against Aqua Hotels.3 
B. Summary Judgment Disposition Of HRS § 378-2 Claim
Plaintiff asserts an individual "disparate treatment"
theory of discrimination, claiming Defendants intentionally
discriminated against her because of her age.  See Shoppe v.
Gucci America, Inc., 94 Hawai #i 368, 377-78, 14 P.3d 1049, 1058-
59 (2000) (describing the available theories of discrimination). 
Plaintiff's claim relies on circumstantial evidence that the
employer's proffered explanations for her termination were
pretext for age discrimination.  In such cases, our courts apply
the three-step burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell
Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).4  Shoppe, 94 Hawai# i
at 378, 14 P.3d at 1059.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The first step of the McDonnell Douglas framework 
requires that the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of 
discrimination by demonstrating, by a preponderance of evidence, 
the following four elements: (1) that plaintiff is a member of a 
protected class; (2) that plaintiff is qualified for the position 
for which plaintiff has applied or from which plaintiff has been 
discharged; (3) that plaintiff has suffered some adverse 
employment action, such as a discharge; and (4) that the position 
still exists. Shoppe, 94 Hawai' i at 378, 14 P.3d at 1059. 
We agree with the circuit court's conclusion that
 
Plaintiff established a prima facie case. There is no dispute
 
that Plaintiff satisfied the first and third elements. Plaintiff
 
presented uncontroverted evidence that she performed her duties
 
as DOSM proficiently. Plaintiff also presented sufficient
 
evidence showing that Defendants considered employing Plaintiff
 
as the DOS, evidencing her qualification for both positions. As
 
for the fourth element, there is at minimum a question of fact as
 
to whether Plaintiff's position still existed. Although
 
Defendants contend the DOS position eliminated Plaintiff's
 
position, they acknowledge the DOS position entailed at least
 
some of the same duties as Plaintiff's position. Plaintiff thus
 
presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of
 
disparate treatment. 
Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the 
burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a 
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment 
action. Shoppe, 94 Hawai' i at 378, 14 P.3d at 1059. "The 
employer's explanation must be in the form of admissible evidence and must clearly set forth reasons that, if believed by the trier 
of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was 
not the cause of the challenged employment action." Id. 
Defendants met their burden. In support of their
 
motion for summary judgment, Defendants proffered evidence that,
 
following bankruptcy by the prior owner of KBR and foreclosure
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
upon KBR, Kai Management assumed management responsibilities for
 
KBR and began to undertake cost-cutting restructuring measures. 
These measures included the elimination of Plaintiff's commuting
 
benefits, the need to restructure the DOSM position into the DOS
 
position, and the need to have a DOS who could remain readily
 
available on-site. Defendants further proffered evidence that,
 
upon elimination of the DOSM position, Plaintiff was encouraged
 
to apply for the DOS position if she was interested and serious
 
about moving to Kauai. Plaintiff did not apply for the DOS
 
position.
 
If the employer rebuts the prima facie case, the burden 
reverts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant's 
proffered reasons were "pretextual." Id. at 379, 14 P.3d at 
1060. "A plaintiff may establish pretext either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely 
motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the 
employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Id. 
(internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff's prima facie case of discrimination, coupled with a disbelief of the 
employer's explanation, may permit the trier of fact to conclude 
the employer unlawfully discriminated. Reeves v. Sanderson 
Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133 ,147, (2000); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993). The evidence and 
all inferences drawn must be viewed in the light most favorable 
to the party opposing summary judgment. Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i 
at 72 n.4, 123 P.3d at 197 n.4. 
Plaintiff pointed to specific facts sufficient to raise
 
doubts as to the credibility of the Defendants' proffered
 explanations. There is no dispute that Graf informed Plaintiff
 
she could continue her employment if she gave up her commuting
 
benefits and relocated to Kauai. KBR's chief operating officer
 
also testified that although he made the decision to eliminate
 
Plaintiff's commuting benefits as part of KBR's restructuring, he
 
believed Plaintiff would retain her employment. The record shows
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that on August 2, 2010, ten days before Graf informed Plaintiff
 
of her termination, Plaintiff emailed Graf stating her agreement
 
to relocate to Kauai and to relinquish her commuting benefits. 
Based on this record, a rational fact-finder could infer that
 
Defendants' stated reasons for Plaintiff's termination lacked
 
credibility and were pretextual. 
Moreover, the circuit court's oral ruling granting 
Defendants' summary judgment motion indicates it improperly 
favored Defendants' version of the facts. It cited Plaintiff's 
commuting costs, ignoring the fact that Plaintiff agreed to 
relinquish those benefits before she was terminated. It also 
credited Defendants' claim that they "operated under the [belief] 
that [P]laintiff was not going to relocate and began the 
restructuring plans[,]" and therefore it "believe[d] that age was 
not a factor" in the termination decision. Viewing the facts in 
the light most favorable to Plaintiff however, the circuit court 
should have credited the chief operating officer's statement that 
he believed Plaintiff would remain employed under the 
restructuring plan. Additionally, Graf's July 30, 2010 letter to 
Plaintiff noted her initial statement that she would not relocate 
but then requested that she confirm her intentions regarding 
relocation. Graf's August 5, 2010 drafted letter to Plaintiff 
also indicates Defendants considered continuing Plaintiff's 
employment by employing her as the DOS. "[S]ummary judgment 
should not be granted unless the entire record shows a right to 
judgment with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy 
and establishes affirmatively that the adverse party cannot 
prevail under any circumstances." Balthazar, 109 Hawai' i at 72, 
123 P.3d at 197 (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to raise genuine issues 
of material fact regarding when Defendants made the decision to 
terminate Plaintiff and what factors motivated that decision. 
Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment 
against Plaintiff on her HRS § 378-2 claim. 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
12C. Summary Judgment Disposition Of IIED Claim
Plaintiff's second cause of action asserted an IIED
claim based on her termination.  In support of this claim,
Plaintiff failed to allege any facts beyond those supporting her
discrimination claim.  The circuit court concluded Defendants'
alleged conduct failed to rise to the level of "outrageous" or
"extreme" conduct, and we agree.
Our courts have adopted the Restatement (Second) of
Torts' approach to IIED claims.  Hac, 102 Hawai# i at 60-61, 73
P.3d at 106-07.  The elements of an IIED claim are: 1) that the
act allegedly causing the harm was intentional or reckless, 2)
that the act was outrageous, and 3) that the act caused 4)
extreme emotional distress to another."  Id.   "The question
whether the actions of the alleged tortfeasor are unreasonable or
outrageous is for the court in the first instance[.]"  Ross, 76
Hawai#i at 465, 879 P.2d at 1048.  Restatement (Second) of Torts
§ 46 cmt. d (1965) characterizes outrageous conduct as follows:
It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an
intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has
intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his
conduct has been characterized by "malice," or a degree of
aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive
damages for another tort. Liability has been found only
where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and
so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of
decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly
intolerable in a civilized community. 
Our case law is clear that termination alone, even if
based on discrimination, is not sufficient to support an IIED
claim without a showing of something outrageous about the manner
or process of termination.  See Shoppe,  94 Hawai #i at 387, 14
P.3d at 1068 (employee's allegations of termination based on age
discrimination and of manager's "vicious" verbal attack,
shouting, and criticism in front of other employees were
insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact of
outrageousness); Ross, 76 Hawai #i at 465, 879 P.2d at 1048
(termination based on alleged marital status discrimination wasFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
insufficient to sustain IIED claim). Here, nothing in the record
 
shows that Defendants' manner of terminating Plaintiff rose to
 
the level of outrageousness. We therefore affirm the circuit
 
court's grant of summary judgment as to Plaintiff's IIED claim. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We vacate the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's
 
August 21, 2012 "Order Granting Defendants Aqua Hotels And
 
Resorts, Inc.'s and Kai Management Services LLC's Motion For
 
Summary Judgment" and the September 18, 2012 "Final Judgment,"
