NO. CAAP-12-0000837
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
OCEANIC COMPANIES, INC., Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KUKUI'ULA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (HAWAII), LLC, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0940)
 
ORDER GRANTING DECEMBER 3, 2012 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Oceanic 
Companies, Inc.'s (Appellee Oceanic), December 3, 2012 motion to 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000837 for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendant-Appellant Kukui
'ula 
Development Company (Hawaii), LLC's (Appellant Kukui' ula 
Development Company), December 10, 2012 memorandum in opposition 
to Appellee Oceanic's December 3, 2012 motion to dismiss 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000837 for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction, and (3) the record on appeal, it appears that we do 
not have jurisdiction over Appellant Kukui' ula Development 
Company's appeal from the Honorable Patrick W. Border's September 10, 2012 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and 
Order" (the September 10, 2012 order), because the circuit court 
has not yet reduced the September 10, 2012 order to a separate NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2012) and Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
require for an appeal under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
HRS ยง 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS ยง 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS ยง 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been 
entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant 
to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed 
in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339 (footnote omitted). 
On February 22, 2013, the record on appeal was filed 
for appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000837, which does not contain a final judgment. Although the circuit court appears to 
have resolved the claims in this case through the September 10, 
2012 order, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has consistently held 
over the past nineteen years that, "based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all 
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Absent the entry of an appealable final judgment in this case, Appellant Kukui' ula 
Development Company's appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000837.
