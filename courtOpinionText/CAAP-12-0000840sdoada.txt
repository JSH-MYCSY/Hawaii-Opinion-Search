ANDREW E. SHIMKUS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-12-00225)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Andrew E. Shimkus (Shimkus) appeals
 
from the Judgment entered on September 13, 2012, in the District
 
Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Shimkus was
 
convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013).
2 We affirm.
 
1/ The Honorable Shirley Kawamura presided.
 
2/ HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:

A police officer pulled Shimkus over for speeding,
 
after the officer's laser speed detection device revealed that
 
Shimkus's vehicle was traveling 73 miles per hour (mph) in a 35
 mph zone. The officer subsequently arrested Shimkus for OVUII. 
After placing Shimkus under arrest, the officer read to Shimkus a
 form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle
 Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent Form). Shimkus
 agreed to take a breath test and refused a blood test. Shimkus's
 breath test showed that he had a breath alcohol concentration of
 .176 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath -- a concentration
 that exceeded the legal limit. Shimkus moved to suppress the
 results of his breath test, and the District Court denied his
 motion. 
On appeal, Shimkus challenges the District Court's
 
denial of his motion to suppress. Shimkus argues that: (1)
 because the police failed to give him Miranda warnings before
 reading the Implied Consent Form to him and obtaining his
 decision on testing, the results of his breath test should have
 been suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation; (2) the
 results of his breath test should have been suppressed because
 the police misinformed him of his statutory right to an attorney
 under HRS § 803-9 (1993); and (3) the results of his breath test
 should have been suppressed because the police misinformed him of
 the sanctions for refusing to submit to testing. 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, No. CAAP-12-0000858, --- Hawai
'i ---, --- P.3d ---, 2014 WL 
1270615 (Hawai 'i App. Mar. 28, 2014) (as amended on May 2, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied
