 STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
SAMUEL K. KEA, III, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-0094)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Samuel K. Kea, III ("Kea") appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on
 
September 18, 2012, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").
1/ After a hearing on Kea's Motion to Withdraw
 
Guilty Plea ("Motion"), the Circuit Court denied the motion and
 convicted Kea as a young adult defendant on the counts that he
 initially pled guilty to: two counts of Sexual Assault in the
 First Degree ("Sex Assault 1"), in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
2/
Statutes ("HRS") § 707-730(1)(b)  ("Counts 1 and 5"); two counts
of Attempted Sex Assault 1, in violation of HRS §§ 705-500 & 707­730(1)(b) ("Counts 3 and 6"); and two counts of Sexual Assault
 
1/
 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided.
 
2/
 HRS § 707-730(1)(b) provides that "[a] person commits the offense
of sexual assault in the first degree if . . . [t]he person knowingly engages
in sexual penetration with another person who is less than fourteen years
old[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707-730(1)(b) (Supp. 2012). 
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the Third Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(b)3/
 
("Counts 4 and 7"). 
The court sentenced Kea as a youthful offender to an
 
eight-year term of imprisonment on each of Counts 1, 3, 5, and 6;
 
and a four-year term of imprisonment on each of Counts 4 and 7;
 
with credit for time served. The sentences were to run
 concurrently with each other. 
On appeal, Kea argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
denying his Motion, and he contests Conclusion of Law ("COL") 21
 of the September 28, 2012 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
 Law Denying Defendant's Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kea's points of error as follows:
 
The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Kea's Motion. The testimony of Kea's former counsel, which the Circuit Court found to be credible, provides substantial evidence in support of COL 21.
4/ See State v. Buch, 
83 Hawai' i 308, 321, 926 P.2d 599, 612 (1996) ("[A]n appellate 
court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses[.]" (quoting Domingo v. State, 76 Hawai' i 237, 242, 873 
P.2d 775, 789 (1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, COL 21 is not clearly erroneous and there is no "fair and just reason" to support Kea's withdrawal of his guilty plea. See State v. Merino, 81 Hawai' i 198, 223-24, 915 P.2d 672, 697-98 
(1996). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, filed on September 18, 2012, in the Circuit Court
 
3/
 HRS § 707-732(1)(b) provides that "[a] person commits the offense
of sexual assault in the third degree if . . . [t]he person knowingly subjects
to sexual contact another person who is less than fourteen years old or causes
such a person to have sexual contact with the person[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707­
732(1)(b). 
4/
 COL 21 is a mislabeled finding of fact.
