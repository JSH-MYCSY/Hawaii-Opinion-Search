STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ALEXANDER BORERO, III a.k.a. ALEXANDER BORRERO, III,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-312 )
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Alexander Borero, III (Borero)
 
appeals from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" entered
 
September 10, 2012 nunc pro tunc to September 6, 2012 in the
 
1
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  (circuit court).
At proceedings held May 2, 2011, Borero pled guilty to
 
unauthorized control of propelled vehicle (count one), attempted
 assault in the first degree (count two), and negligent injury in
 the first degree (count three).
 
On appeal, Borero contends: (1) the circuit court
 
abused its discretion when it denied "[Borero's] Motion to
 Withdraw Guilty Plea Entered May 2, 2011," (2) the circuit court
 abused its discretion when it denied "[Borero's] Motion For

 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Reconsideration of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 
Order Denying [Borero's] Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea" (motion
 to reconsider), and (3) that he was denied effective assistance
 of counsel.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Borero's
 appeal is without merit.
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion
 
when it denied "[Borero's] Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea Entered
 May 2, 2011."
 
"Generally, we review the trial court's denial of a
 
motion to withdraw guilty plea for abuse of discretion." State
 
v. Topasna, 94 Hawai' i 444, 452, 16 P.3d 849, 857 (App. 2000). 
If our review of the court's discretion hinges on the constitutional inquiry whether the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered his or her plea of guilty, we review de novo. Id. 
"A defendant does not enjoy an absolute right to
 
withdraw his or her guilty plea." Id. at 451, 16 P.3d at 856. 
Where the motion is made before sentencing, "the motion should be
 granted if the defendant has presented a fair and just reason for
 his request and the prosecution has not relied upon the guilty
 plea to its substantial prejudice." Id. at 451, 16 P.3d at 856.
 
There are two recognized bases for a "fair and just
 
reason" to withdraw a guilty plea: (1) "that the defendant did
 not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive the rights
 relinquished upon pleading guilty[;]" or (2) "that changed
 circumstances or new information justify withdrawal of the plea."
 Id. at 452, 16 P.3d at 857. The defendant has the burden of
 establishing plausible and legitimate grounds for the withdrawal. 
Id. at 451, 16 P.3d at 856.
 
Borero contends he did not knowingly, intelligently, or
 
voluntarily waive his right to trial because Borero's former
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
counsel (former counsel): (1) was unaware of Borero's third-grade
 
reading level and prior psychological history, (2) provided
 Borero with an incomplete "sentencing analysis," (3) did not
 provide Borero with copies of police photographs, and (4) devoted
 little time to Borero's case. However, the circuit court's plea
 colloquy and testimony of Borero's former counsel refute Borero's
 contention. 
The circuit court fully apprised Borero of his rights
 
as required by Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 
11(c),(d), and (f). Before accepting his plea, the circuit court
 ensured Borero understood how sentencing would work under the
 agreement:
 
THE COURT: [I]n exchange for your plea to the charges
in the complaint superseding indictment and your agreement
to pay applicable restitution in the amount to be determined
at the time of sentencing the State has agreed to cap its
request to a total of 20 years in prison as a mandatory
minimum, uh, with a mandatory minimum sentence of three
years and four months inclusive of the sentences you have
already received in CR Number 5-1-103, Criminal Number 10-1­94K, Criminal Number 10-1-130, Criminal Number 10-1-263K. 
I take it what I just read, [former counsel], means
that they would, uh, the -- whatever mandatory minimum
sentence would be three years and four months concurrent?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: It would be total of three years
and four months, Judge. 
So in other words Mr. Borero would
 
serve -- would receive a mandatory minimum of a total of
three years and four months.
 
. . . .
 
THE COURT: -- it could be in the combination of zero
 
mandatory minimum for the Class C's and three-four for the
Class B?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: Correct.
 
. . . .
 THE COURT: All right. The exact division of
 
sentences and determination of which counts in criminal
 
numbers shall run concurrently or consecutively to be
determined by [Borero] and communicated to the Adult
Probation Department by or before the deadline for
[Borero's] input. 
State would not ask for extended terms of
 
incarceration. 
Okay. That's the extent of your understanding of your
plea agreement with the State in this case?

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[BORERO]: Yes, sir.
 
Former counsel's testimony at the hearing on
 
"[Borero's] Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea" further confirms
 
Borero's understanding:
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: I kept [Borero] abreast of the –- of
-- of the negotiations because obviously at first we didn't
reach an agreement. Um, the offer that was made was not
acceptable to me and I passed that along to [Borero] and I
said, you know, I don't think this is a fair deal.
 
Um, to backtrack a little, normally we go through the
discovery or I go through the discovery with the client. So
 I went through the discovery with [Borero]. We talked about
 the various [strengths] and weaknesses of the case, and the
various charges. We also discussed the fact that he had all
 [these] other pending charges that weren't really related to
this but . . . nonetheless had to be considered as part of
the plea agreement. 
So we went through all of that and as each plea offer
was made we would discuss the benefits and the detriments of
 those agreements, and [Borero] would yay or nay or tell me
whether he agreed or disagreed. He'd ask whether I thought
it was a fair deal or not, um and until we reached an
agreement basically I told him no. At some point in time I
basically said, okay, this is within the realm but it's up
to you. He chose to go with it and that's what we did.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: Okay.
 
And during those discussions . . . did you believe that
[Borero] understood what you were talking about?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: Yes.
 [DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: At any time did [Borero]
indicate to you that he could not read or that he had . . .
a low reading level?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: No.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: At any time did [Borero] tell
you he could not understand English?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: No.
 [DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: At any time did [Borero] tell
you during these discussions that he was suffering from some
form of mental condition that would prevent him from
understanding what you were telling him?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: No.
 
. . . .
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: Did you have any...indication
that [Borero] did not understand what he was doing when he
rejected an offer?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: 
No.
 
. . . .
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:  Did the questions [Borero] asked
make sense with regard to what you were discussing?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: Yes.
 
. . . .
 [DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: 
Okay. So when you gave [Borero]
the change of plea form I believe that was while he was at
court; is that correct?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]:  
Yes.
 
. . . .
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: 
You read [the change of plea
form] aloud to [Borero]?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: 
Yes.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:  
At any time did he indicate he
didn't understand what you were saying?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]:  
No.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:  
At any time did he indicate that
he was having a panic attack during that time?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]:  
No.
 
. . . .
 [DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:
 
So you recall the change of plea
hearing?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: 
Yes.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:  
And you had no indication at
that hearing that [Borero] did not understand what was going
on?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: No.

 
Former counsel reviewed all evidence and relayed all
 
information relevant to Borero's charges and defenses:
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:  And did you review discovery with
[Borero]?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]:  Yes.
 
. . . . 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]:  Do you review all discovery with
your clients? 
Everything that's turned over by the
Prosecutor's Office do you review with you clients?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]:  No.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: Why not?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: Because a lot of it is a waste of
time. Um, if you look, um, at your typical discovery packet
will contain often times two, sometimes three copies of the
same thing. Um, there's the multiple copies of the OBTS
sheets which are basically just summaries of the substantive
reports.
 
So normally what I do is I'll review all the
substantive stuff that makes the difference with regard to
whether or not that individual is going to be convicted or
has defenses, et cetera.
 
. . . . 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: It is your practice then in a criminal
case to review all the discovery yourself?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: Yes.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: And you review what you consider
pertinent discovery with your clients?
 
[FORMER COUNSEL]: Correct.
 
[DEPUTY PROSECUTOR]: Okay.
 
And did you do that in this case with [Borero]?
 [FORMER COUNSEL]: Yes. 
Finally, Borero's allegation that former counsel spent
 
an insufficient amount of time on his case is unsupported. 
Borero did not meet his burden for showing plausible and
 legitimate grounds for withdrawal. 
(2) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
when it denied Borero's motion to reconsider. A circuit court's ruling with regard to a party's motion for reconsideration is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. State v. 
Oughterson, 99 Hawai' i 244, 253, 54 P.3d 415, 424 (2002). 
"Generally, to constitute an abuse, it must appear that 
the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. Crisostomo, 94 Hawai' i 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000) (internal quotation marks,
 
citations, and brackets omitted).
 
Borero contends his motion to reconsider presented the
 
circuit court with changed circumstances or new information
 sufficient to justify withdrawal of his plea. Borero declares he
 did not have the opportunity to review the transcript from his
 grand jury indictment. Former counsel, who the circuit court
 found credible, testified that he reviewed all discovery and
 shared the relevant information with Borero.
 
Borero failed to show that this new evidence or 
argument in his motion to reconsider could not have been presented in his motion to withdraw guilty plea. See Oughterson, 
99 Hawai' i at 255, 54 P.3d at 426. In addition, the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the purported new evidence did not provide a fair and just reason for Borero to withdraw his pleas. 
(3) Borero fails to establish an ineffective
 
assistance of counsel claim.
 
When reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of 
counsel, we look at whether defense counsel's assistance was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. See State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513-14, 78 P.3d 
317, 326-27 (2003). To establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim Borero must show: "1) that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." Id. To satisfy the second prong, Borero 
need only show a possible, not actual or probable, impairment to a potentially meritorious defense. See Id. 
Borero contends former counsel: (1) failed to
 
understand Borero's reading limitations and psycological history,
 (2) failed to provide Borero with copies of photographs, and (3)
 created an incorrect sentencing analysis. Borero concludes
 "[t]hese failures directly resulted in [his] relinquishment of
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
his constitutional right to jury trial, i.e., a potentially
 
meritorious defense."
 
Borero did not meet his burden of showing a possibility
 
of impairment to a potentially meritorious defense. The alleged
 errors are contradicted by the on-the-record colloquy and by
 former counsel's testimony.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that "Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence" entered September 10, 2012 nunc pro tunc to September
 6, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
