SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In three related appeals arising from the same civil
 
case, (1) Petitioners/Appellants/Cross-Appellees Eggs 'N Things
 
International Holdings PTE, Ltd. (ENT International), Eggs 'N
 
Things Japan, K.K.(ENT Japan), and Kouta Matsuda (Matsuda)
 
(collectively, Eggs Petitioners) appeal from the December 13,
 
2012 "Judgment Regarding Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
and Order Partially Granting Petitioner's Motion for Order
 Confirming Partial Final Decision and Award of Arbitrator, Dated
 July 15, 2011, and Final Decision and Award of Arbitrator (Fees
 and Costs)" (Judgment); (2) Respondent/Appellee/Cross-Appellant
 
ENT Holdings, LLC (ENT Holdings) cross-appeals from the same
 
Judgment and the October 5, 2012 "Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law and Order Partially Granting Petitioners'
 Motion for Order Confirming Partial Final Decision and Award of
 Arbitrator, Dated July 15, 2011, and Final Decision and Award of
 Arbitrator (Fees and Costs)" (FOFs/COLs/Order); and (3) Eggs
 
Petitioners appeal from the circuit court's April 30, 2013 "Final
 
Judgment Re Memorandum Opinion and Order Partially Granting
 Petitioners' Motion for Fees and Costs, Filed February 15, 2013"
 (April 30, 2013 Judgment). ENT Holdings filed its cross-appeal
 
from the April 30, 2013 Judgment on May 10, 2013. The judgments
 
and order were entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1
 
(circuit court). On August 22, 2013, this court filed its order
 
consolidating appeals in case nos. CAAP-13-0000592 and CAAP-13­
2
0001150  under case no. CAAP-13-0000592. 
On appeal, Eggs Petitioners contend the circuit court
 
erred by:
 
(1) modifying (reducing) and/or vacating the
 
arbitrator's award of damages and fees by cutting the hourly
 
rates approved by the arbitrator without any basis;
 
(2) vacating the arbitrator's award of $181,570.63 for

the Venture Counsel Law firm's fees in its entirety without any
 
basis; and
 
(3) reducing the hourly rates requested by Eggs
 
Petitioners for their attorneys and a paralegal in awarding them
 fees and costs incurred in the circuit court proceedings.
 
On cross-appeal, ENT Holdings contends the circuit
 
court erred by: 
(1) denying their request to vacate the arbitrator's
 
partial decision in part because the arbitrator exceeded his
 powers by awarding damages that were not measured by Eggs
 Petitioners' actual damages;
 
(2) denying their request to vacate the arbitrator's
 
final decision in part because the arbitrator exceeded his powers
 by shifting fees incurred in a separate federal action;
 
(3) denying their request to vacate the arbitrator's
 
fee award to Eggs Petitioners; and
 
(4) imposing liability on them for prejudgment interest
 
on attorneys' fees and tax without reciting a factual basis for
 the award and which was not included of the arbitration award.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Eggs
 Petitioners' and ENT Holdings' appeals as follows.
 
The parties disagree as to whether the Federal 
Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1-307 et seq. (2012), or 
Hawai
'i's Uniform Arbitration Act, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
3
Chapter 658A  , governs the instant case.  Effective March 21,
 
2009, Matsuda and ENT Holdings entered into an Eggs 'N Things

 
License Agreement (License Agreement) under which Matsuda
 acquired rights to use the "Eggs 'N Things" brand in Japan and
 
other Asian countries. Item no. 15 of the License Agreement
 
3 
HRS Chapter 658A is based on the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act
(2000), which was approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws in 2000 and revised the Uniform Arbitration Act that had been adopted in 1955. In re Arbitration Between United Pub. Workers, AFSCME,

provided that Hawai 'i state law and applicable federal law 
governed the License Agreement.
 
The "applicability of the FAA is the same with respect
 
to state and federal claims and whether such claims are pursued

 
in state or federal court." Brown v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 82
 
Hawai'i 226, 235, 921 P.2d 146, 155 (1996). The parties' dispute 
specifically concerns the interpretation of the FAA provision
 
that authorizes vacatur "when the arbitrators exceeded their
 powers[,]" 9 U.S.C. § 10, which is virtually identical to the
 provision in Hawai
'i's arbitration law, requiring vacatur if an 
"arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers[.]" HRS § 658A­23(a)(4) (Supp. 2013).

4 	HRS § 658A-23 (Supp. 2013) provides:
 
§658A-23 Vacating Award  (a) Upon motion to the court
by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court shall
vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:
 
(1)	 The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or
other undue means;
 
(2)	 There was:
 
(A)	 Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator;
 
(B)	 Corruption by an arbitrator; or
 
(C)	 Misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing
the rights of a party to the arbitration
proceeding;
 
(3)	 An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing
upon showing of sufficient cause for
postponement, refused to consider evidence
material to the controversy, or otherwise
conducted the hearing contrary to section
658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
 
(4)	 An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;
 
(5)	 There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the
person participated in the arbitration
proceeding without raising the objection under
section 658A-15(c) not later than the beginning
of the arbitration hearing; or
 
(6)	 The arbitration was conducted without proper
notice of the initiation of an arbitration as
 required in section 658A-9 so as to prejudice
substantially the rights of a party to the
arbitration proceeding.

We conclude that HRS Chapter 658A provides the
 
applicable standards for reviewing the circuit court's rulings on 
the parties' motions in support of and in opposition to the vacation of the award. We construe the License Agreement as applying Hawai
'i law and conclude that there are no material 
differences between the FAA and HRS Chapter 658A as applied to this case. Inasmuch as ENT Holdings cites federal authorities, we may use those authorities to guide our interpretation of substantially similar provisions of HRS § 658A-23. Use of federal precedent to aid the interpretation of State laws "makes sense where the statutory language is the same or similar in all relevant respects." Bombardier Transp. (Holdings) USA Inc. v. 
Dir., Dep't of Budget & Fiscal Servs., City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 128 Hawai

Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), Inc. v. Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union, Local 142, AFL-CIO, 112 Hawai
'i 489, 507 n. 33, 146 P.3d 
1066, 1084 n. 33 (2006)). 
A. ENT Holdings' Cross-Appeal
 
ENT Holdings contends the arbitrator disregarded the 
scope of his powers under the License Agreement and established law "by awarding a remedy that was not measured by [Eggs Petitioners'] 'actual damages.'" The License Agreement provided "[t]he arbitral tribunal shall not be empowered to award any form of punitive damages or any other remedy not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages . . . ." "Actual losses or damages are those that are real and substantial as opposed to speculative." McLellan v. Atchison Ins. Agency, Inc., 81 Hawai
'i 
62, 66, 912 P.2d 559, 563 (App. 1996) (citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The arbitrator found ENT International established it
 
would likely have "open[ed] at least one additional licensed
 restaurant but for the negative publicity created by the
 Disclaimer[

] and the uncertainty of its rights created by the

In March 2008, ENT Holdings acquired the Eggs 'N Things restaurant
located in Waikiki ( Waikiki Restaurant ) and licensed FB Innovation Hawai' i,
Inc. (FB Innovation)  to operate the restaurant. On or around May 15, 2010, FB
Innovation placed the following "Disclaimer" on the website
www.eggsnthings.com and at the Waikiki Restaurant:

Default Letter [, 6
]" and based the award on the average monthly
revenues of the existing restaurant in Harajuku, Japan (Harajuku
Restaurant), the length of time it would have taken to open the
 
prospective restaurant, and the royalties to be paid to ENT
 
International. Other than fees and costs incurred in the federal
 action, the arbitrator rejected ENT Japan's claim for damages,
 but found "more compelling" ENT International's argument that
 "but for such wrongful actions by [ENT Holdings], ENT
 International would have been able to establish, operate and
 generate profits from one or more additional restaurants . . .,
 although requiring considerable speculation," and provided
 further discussion in Part X of the decision. In Part X, which
 addressed business defamation and commercial disparagement
 claims, the arbitrator stated "the profits that could have been
 realized from [opening additional franchised restaurants were]
 somewhat speculative - not all restaurant outlets prove
 profitable, and there is no certainty that the performance of the
 first restaurant . . . would be as great for the Harajuku
 Restaurant . . . ." Because the second restaurant's lost 
profits
 
were "speculative," the arbitrator instead decided to measure the
 loss to ENT International through the "loss of franchise fees
 that would have accrued to ENT International in licensing a

On January 20, 2010, ENT Holdings sent Christopher Evans (Evans),
Matsuda's attorney, a letter ( Default Letter ) stating that "the current plans
to open the Japan restaurant in February constitute a breach of the LicenseAgreement . . . due to [Matsuda's] failure to adequately train his cooks andto create menu items consistent with ENT's image." The Default Letter contained a proposal under which Matsuda would: (1) have three cooks train inHawai'i for 89 days, followed by successive 89 day periods to train three
cooks at a time to a skill level that satisfied the Waikiki Restaurant's head cook; (2) conduct a 200-subject blind taste-test comparing pancake mixes fromMatsuda's restaurant with those used in the Waikiki Restaurant, yielding atleast 90% of respondents preferring Matsuda's pancake mix or considering itequal to the Waikiki Restaurant's mix; and (3) have no restaurant open inJapan until at least nine cooks were trained and accepted and the blindtaste-test was completed with required results.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
second location . . . ." (Emphasis added.) The arbitrator then
 
enumerated "assumptions" upon which he based his award of
 royalties to ENT International. 
ENT Holdings' contention that ENT International's 
inability to open a second restaurant could not constitute evidence of actual damages concerns the arbitrator's interpretation of "actual damages," which he understood included the loss of franchise fees from the prospective restaurant. Even if the arbitrator misinterpreted the legal term "actual damages," this alleged misinterpretation would not constitute reversible error. See Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai
'i 226, 239, 54 P.3d 
7
397, 410 (2002);  Daiichi Hawai 'i Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 
103 Hawai 'i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 411, 422 (2003) ("[W]here the 
parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby assume all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law and in their findings of fact." (Citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.)) 
Nor does ENT Holdings show the arbitrator

 
"intentionally and plainly disregarded" relevant substantive law
 by awarding in favor of ENT International for prevailing on its
 business defamation claim. Ventress v. Japan Airlines, 603 F.3d
 
676, 679 (9th Cir. 2010) interpreting HRS § 658A-23(a)(4)
 (providing that a court shall vacate an arbitration award if an
 arbitrator exceeded its powers). 
ENT Holdings also fails to show that the arbitrator
 
exceeded his powers by "shifting fees incurred in the separate
 federal action." The arbitrator stated, "because they were
 incurred as a result of the breach of the License Agreement by
 [ENT Holdings], the costs and reasonable legal fees incurred in
 obtaining the [federal] Injunction may be sought as part of such
 
7 
Tatibouet refers to HRS §§ 658-9 and 658-10, both of which were 
repealed in 2001 when the Hawai' i Legislature adopted the Uniform Arbitration
Act. See 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265 §§ 23 and 24 at 817-18. The former 
§ 658–8 (Award and Confirming Award) was split into § 658A–19 (Supp. 2013) and
§ 658A–22 (Supp. 2013), § 658–9 (Vacating Award) is now § 658A–23, and§ 658–10 (Modifying or Correcting Award) is now § 658A–24 (Supp. 2013). This court has applied case law interpretations of HRS Chapter 658 to thesesuccessor provisions. See Carrillo v. Re/Max Kaua' i, No. CAAP-11-0000061 
(App. May 3, 2012) (mem.).

application." Item No. 12.5 of the License Agreement, titled
 
"Arbitral Tribunal," provided "[t]he arbitration award may award
 reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party[,]" and did
 not expressly restrict the award of attorneys' fees to those
 incurred before the arbitration tribunal. The arbitrator
 interpreted the License Agreement to permit legal fees incurred
 by ENT International's litigation of its contract breach claim in
 the federal case as actual damages. Although ENT Holdings
 phrases its contention against the arbitrator's award of
 attorneys' fees as an act in excess of his powers, its contention
 amounts to a claim that the arbitrator erred by misinterpreting
 the License Agreement and/or by applying it to the parties'
 claims and thus raises no reversible error.
 
ENT Holdings also fails to support its contention that
 
the arbitrator exceeded his powers by manifestly disregarding law
 governing attorneys' fees. ENT Holdings does not directly
 challenge the "reasonableness" of the arbitrator's award of
 attorneys' fees, but instead contends the arbitrator exceeded his
 authority by disregarding the law governing the award of
 reasonable attorneys' fees provided by the License Agreement.
 
The circuit court recognized applicable law governing
 
whether awarded attorneys' fees were "reasonable" in the
 following cases: Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), Sound
 v. Koller, 2010 WL 1992198 (D. Hawai
'i 2010), Blake v. Nishimura, 
2010 WL 1372420 (D. Hawai 'i 2010) (cited in Koller), and McMillon 
v. Hawai 'i, 2011 WL 744900 (D. Hawai 'i 2011) (cited in Koller). 
The arbitrator's decision on duplicate billing referred to Koller and "both of the cases cited in Koller[.]" The arbitrator also cited Hensley to determine that principal issues were decided in favor of ENT International and ENT Japan and to reject "a mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon." (Hensley, 461 U.S. at 428, quoting No. 75-CV-87-C at 7 (WD Mo. Jan. 23 1981), Record 220 (internal quotation marks omitted)). 
ENT Holdings contends "the arbitrator here identified
 
the correct law and then decided not to apply it." According to
 ENT Holdings, because Eggs Petitioners did not prevail in all of
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
their claims, the arbitrator was required to engage in a Hensley 
analysis "to determine whether it is reasonable to award [attorneys'] fees for the entire time the plaintiff's counsel spent on the case." (Citing Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai
'i 408, 32 P.3d 52 (2001)). Hensley stated 
that determining attorneys' fees in a given case involves "what essentially are factual matters" and is better left to the original fact finder. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. "There is no 
precise rule or formula for making these determinations [of reasonable attorney fee awards]." Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. 
Hensley requires a court to "make clear that it has considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained." Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437. 
The arbitrator explained that although Eggs
 
International and Eggs Japan did not sustain all of their claims
 (and noting that ENT Holdings did not prevail on any of its
 claims), he would "not significantly discount such [attorneys']
 fees on the theory that [Eggs International and Eggs Japan] did
 not prevail on some arithmetic count of their claims." The
 arbitrator cited the following passage from Hensley, 461 U.S. at
 435 (citation omitted): 
Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his
attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee. . .
Litigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds
for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or
failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason
for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.
 
The arbitrator found "the principal issues were each
 
decided in favor of [Eggs International and Eggs Japan]" and it
 
was not "necessarily significant that a prevailing plaintiff did
 not receive all the relief requested" because in light of
 Hensley, "a plaintiff who failed to recover damages but obtained
 injunctive relief, or vice versa, may recover a fee award based
 on all hours reasonably expended if the relief obtained justified
 that expenditure of attorney time." (Quoting Hensley, 461 U.S.
 at 435 n.11.) The arbitrator concluded that the parties' case
 was one in which an award of attorneys' fees, "unless otherwise
 prohibited in the License Agreement" was appropriate. The
 arbitrator did not act in excess of his powers and the circuit
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court did not err by affirming the arbitrator's decision to award
 
attorneys' fees to Eggs Petitioners, but the circuit court's
 modification of the attorneys' fees and costs award is a separate
 issue, as discussed infra. 
ENT Holdings contends the circuit court erred by
 
awarding prejudgment interest on attorneys' fees running from
 July 25, 2011, the date of the arbitrator's "partial decision,"
 in favor of Eggs Petitioners because the arbitrator did not
 specify a final awarded amount until October 10, 2011, when he
 issued his "Final Decision and Award of Arbitrator (Fees and
 Costs)" (Final Decision). ENT Holdings further contends that
 
interest should accrue only on the specific amount awarded in the
 
July 25, 2011 Partial Decision and not the attorneys' fees and
 costs that the arbitrator ruled Eggs Petitioners were entitled to
 recover in the Partial Decision but were not quantified until
 issuance of the Final Decision.
 
The circuit court did not have authority to award 
prejudgment interest for a period commencing before entry of the arbitration award, but the arbitrator was authorized to impose interest as part of his award and did so by including a clause in the Partial Decision that referred to July 25, 2011 as the date of accrual of interest and the "Award." See Kalawaia v. AIG 
Hawai
'i Ins. Co., 90 Hawai 'i 167, 173, 977 P.2d 175, 181 (1999). 
The "Award" included both the $94,500 in "monetary damages" to ENT International and "an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in amounts to be hereafter established pursuant to the [Dispute Prevention & Resolution] Rules of Arbitration." We conclude that the circuit court did not err in confirming the arbitrator's award of interest accruing from July 25, 2011 on the amounts the arbitrator awarded, which included amounts awarded for attorneys' fees and costs. 
B. Eggs Petitioners' Appeal
 
Eggs Petitioners contend the circuit court lacked the
 
authority to reduce the arbitrator's award of contract damages
 and fees or to vacate the award of fees for the work done by
 Evans, the attorney who negotiated the License Agreement for
 Matsuda. The circuit court concluded, "[n]o cause exist[ed] to
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
vacate the arbitration award pursuant to [HRS] § 658A-23" and
 
proceeded to grant Eggs Petitioners' motion for confirmation
 "with modifications to the hourly rates of attorneys and support
 staff."
 
A court may vacate an arbitration award only on the six 
grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23(a) and may modify or correct an award only on the three grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24 (Supp. 2013).
8 See Kona Village Realty, Inc., v Sunstone Realty 
Partners XIV, LLC, 121 Hawai 'i 110, 113, 214 P.3d 1100, 1103 
(2009). In addition to statutory grounds for vacating or modifying an award, a court may refuse to confirm an award: "one, to allow remand to the arbitrator to clarify an ambiguous award; another, to allow vacation of an arbitration award clearly violative of public policy." Gepaya v. State Farm Mut. Auto. 
Ins. Co., 94 Hawai
'i 362, 365, 14 P.3d 1043, 1046 (2000) 
(internal citation omitted). 
The circuit court did not indicate grounds in HRS
 
§ 658A-24 for its "modification[]" of the arbitrator's award of
 attorneys' fees, including those allocated to Evans, and we
 discern none. The circuit court appears to have vacated in part
 the arbitrator's award. As discussed in regard to ENT Holdings'
 appeal, supra, the arbitrator's decision did not present grounds
 for vacatur under HRS § 658A-23. Nor did the circuit court cite
 
8 	HRS § 658A-24 provides in part:
 
§ 658A-24 Modification or correction of award.  (a) Upon
motion made within ninety days after the movant receives notice of
the award pursuant to section 658A-19 or within ninety days after
the movant receives notice of a modified or corrected award
 pursuant to section 658A-20, the court shall modify or correct the
award if:
 
(1)	 There was an evident mathematical miscalculation
 or an evident mistake in the description of a
person, thing, or property referred to in the
award;
 
(2)	 The arbitrator has made an award on a claim not
 submitted to the arbitrator and the award may be
corrected without affecting the merits of the
decision upon the claims submitted; or
 
(3)	 The award is imperfect in a matter of form not
affecting the merits of the decision on the
claims submitted.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
public policy grounds as a basis for modifying the arbitrator's
 
award.
 
By contrast, the circuit court's April 30, 2013
 
Judgment awarded Eggs Petitioners' attorneys' fees and costs for
 the circuit court proceedings and did not modify or "correct" the
 arbitration award itself.
9 The circuit court reviewed HRS
 
10
§ 607-9 (1993),  HRS § 658A-25(c) (Supp. 2013), and related case
law in determining reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; adopted hourly rates for Eggs Petitioners' counsel already determined to be reasonable in the FOFs/COLs/Order; reviewed case law clarifying "block billing[;]" and found Eggs Petitioners' counsels' partial block billing did not warrant reduction of attorneys' fees; and issued specific findings regarding costs, fees, services, and reasonable hourly rates for Eggs Petitioners' attorneys and paralegals. The circuit court's findings, application of relevant law, and award of attorneys' fees and costs to Eggs Petitioners in the April 30, 2013 Judgment did not constitute an abuse of discretion. See Enoka v. AIG Hawaii Ins. 
Co., Inc., 109 Hawai
'i 537, 544, 128 P.3d 850, 857 (2006) (a 
trial court's grant or denial of attorneys' fees and costs are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard).
