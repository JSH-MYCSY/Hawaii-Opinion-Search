NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DOUGLAS LEOPOLD, Defendant-Appellant, and
ANNETTE CRISANTI; JOHN DOES 1-10; JANE DOES 1-10;

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-652K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Douglas Leopold (Leopold) appeals 
pro se from the Judgment on Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint filed December 29, 2011 (Judgment), which was entered in favor of 
Plaintiff-Appellee Nationstar Mortgage LLC (Nationstar) on November 15, 2012, by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
(Circuit Court).

Leopold's opening brief is woefully non-compliant with 
the requirements of Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28

including, most importantly, that it fails to identify points of 
error or cite to the record on appeal. We, nevertheless, have attempted to review the merits of Leopold's arguments. See 
O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai
'i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 
361, 364 (1994) ("the policies of this court are to permit litigants to appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible") (citations omitted); see also Hawaiian Props., Ltd. v. Tauala, 125 Hawai
'i 176, 181 n.6, 254 P.3d 487, 492 n.6 
(App. 2011). 
Upon review, Leopold's contention that the Circuit
 
Court lacked jurisdiction over this foreclosure case is without
 merit. See Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 603-21.7(a)(3). Leopold's
 
filing of a document entitled "Notice of Final Determination and
 Judgment in Nihil Dicit" did not deprive the Circuit Court of
 jurisdiction over this case. Leopold's related contention that
 Judge Ibarra was required thereafter to recuse himself is not
 supported by the record in this case or applicable law.
 
Based on the undisputed evidence in the record in
 
conjunction with Nationstar's August 10, 2012 motion for summary
 judgment and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure, Nationstar
 established a prima facie case in support of the requested
 relief. See Bank of Honolulu v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 550,
 
654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982). Although Leopold later filed a
 motion to dismiss the case, which was properly denied, he failed
 to timely file an answer to the complaint, failed to seek relief
 from an entry of default, and failed to submit affidavits or
 other evidence creating any genuine issue of material fact. To

the extent we can make them out, Leopold's other arguments are
 
unsupported by the record in this case and/or applicable law, and
 therefore are without merit.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's November 15,
 
2012 Judgment is affirmed.
