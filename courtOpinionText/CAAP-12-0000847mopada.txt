(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Nihilani Group, LLC and
 
Brookfield Homes Hawaii, Inc. (collectively, Brookfield) appeal
 
from the September 12, 2012 "Order Granting Plaintiff Association
 
of Apartment Owners of Nihilani at Princeville Resort's Motion to
 
Enforce Settlement Filed May 10, 2012" entered in the Circuit
   
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court of the Fifth Circuit1 (circuit court). Plaintiff-Appellee 
Association of Apartment Owners of Nihilani at Princeville Resort 
(AOAO) and Brookfield's July 2011 settlement agreement resolved 
breach of construction contract and damages claims relating to a 
condominium construction project in Princeville, Kaua' i 
(Project). 
On appeal, Brookfield contends the circuit court erred
 
in (1) "concluding that there was no genuine issue of material
 fact that the parties had entered into a valid compromise
 
agreement because the Brookfield Appellants were mistaken as to a
 
basic assumption at the time of [executing the settlement
 
agreement]" and (2) awarding attorneys' fees to AOAO.

I. BACKGROUND
 
Nihilani Group, LLC and Brookfield Homes Hawaii, Inc.
 
are, respectively, the developer and general contractor for the
 
Project. On February 16, 2010, AOAO filed their first amended
 
complaint in circuit court, alleging that Brookfield breached its
 
construction contract by failing to (1) provide a proper surface
 
for an interior turnaround area and visitor parking stalls; (2)
 
construct a trash enclosure; and (3) remediate a building mold
 
problem that resulted from improper ground surfacing. Existing
 
surfacing for the turnaround area and visitor parking stalls
 
consisted of "grass crete" (a plastic piece that holds the
 
grass/base) that AOAO found unsatisfactory.
 
In July 2011, AOAO and Brookfield entered a General
 
Release and Settlement Agreement (Agreement) that resolved all
 
claims between the parties. Paragraph 11 of the Agreement
 
provided:
 
1
The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.

 Brookfield's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(1) by omitting a subject matter index
and table of authorities. Counsel for Brookfield is warned future noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28(b) may result in sanctions.

11. Merger; Interpretation
 
This Agreement contains the entire Agreement between
the Parties hereto and supersedes all other prior or
concurrent oral or written letters, agreements, or
understandings between the Parties regarding the Incident.
The terms of this Agreement are contractual and not a mere
recital. The interpretation of this Agreement shall be
decided and construed in accordance with Hawaii law. This
 Agreement is the product of arms-length negotiations between
the Parties and therefore shall be deemed to have been
 drafted jointly by the Parties.
 
The Agreement required Brookfield to replace existing 
grass crete and install pervious concrete in the Project's 
visitor parking and turnaround areas, pending approval from the 
Princeville Community Association's Community Design Committee 
(CDC) and the County of Kaua' i (County). If those permits were 
not approved, Brookfield would "offer the AOAO the 'cash equivalent'" of pervious concrete installation; and if AOAO 
rejected the "cash equivalent", pay AOAO $20,000 and install a 
grass-crete alternative to the form already installed in the 
Project. 
On July 6, 2011, CDC approved Project plans to install
 
pervious concrete as stated in the Agreement. On August 26, 2011,
 
Brookfield requested approval from the County "to change the
 
[Project's] grass pave material to a pervious concrete material
 
supplied by the local concrete vendor" for work scheduled to
 
begin on October 1, 2011. On or about October 21, 2011, the
 
County approved Brookfield's request.
 
On November 15, 2011, AOAO noted that the original date
 
for construction was October 1, 2011 and requested the name of
 
the pervious concrete contractor and the new date for
 
installation. On December 2, 2011, Brookfield informed AOAO that
 
its local contractor was Hawaiian Masonry. On January 5, 2012,
 
Brookfield wrote to AOAO counsel: 
After spending all that time on getting approval for the
grass crete, the contractor has pulled out on doing the work
so we are left with no one to do the work. Brookfield is
 therefore offering the "cash equivalent" of $60,000 to
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
complete its obligations for that part of the General
Release [Agreement].
 
On March 2, 2012, Brookfield informed AOAO that it
 
"believed that the cost of the [pervious concrete] work would be
 
in the range of $60,000 - $80,000[,]" but had since only found
 
contractors willing to complete the work for $200,000 - $240,000.
 
In a letter dated March 12, 2012, AOAO referred Brookfield to
 
Agreement provisions requiring them to install pervious concrete
 
at Project turnaround and visitor parking areas in the event that
 
CDC and the County approved. On May 10, 2012, AOAO filed a
 
motion to enforce the Agreement.
 
At the May 29, 2012 hearing on AOAO's motion,
 
Brookfield argued that the Agreement should not be enforced
 
because the parties entered into the Agreement under the mistaken
 
belief that the cost of the undertaking was $60,000 - $80,000 and
 
not $200,000 - $240,000. Brookfield acknowledged that its
 
mistaken assumption that the cost would "be in the neighborhood
 
of $60,000" was exclusively supported by (1) a March 15, 2010
 
price quote for grass crete parking stalls and (2) a declaration
 
by Brookfield President, Jeffrey Proster that he believed
 
pervious concrete installation would cost between $60,000 Â­
$80,000. The circuit court found (1) no dispute about the
 
validity of the contract or the provisions of the contract, (2)
 
that the parties were not mutually mistaken, and (3) Brookfield
 
raised no genuine issue of material fact precluding enforcement
 
of the Agreement. The circuit court also stated it would grant a
 
reasonable request for AOAO's attorneys' fees.
 
On September 12, 2012, the circuit court filed the
 
"Order Granting Plaintiff Association of Apartment Owners of
 
Nihilani at Princeville Resort's Motion to Enforce Settlement
 
Filed May 10, 2012" and summarily awarded AOAO attorneys' fees
 
and costs in the amount of $5,325,18. On October 12, 2012,
 
Brookfield filed a timely notice of appeal.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Enforcement of a Settlement Agreement
 
Appellate review of an order granting a motion to 
enforce a settlement agreement is the same as it would be for a 
motion for summary judgment. Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 
64, 828 P.2d 286, 292 (1991). A grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is "de novo under the same standard applied by 
the circuit court." Dairy Road Partners v. Island Ins. Co., 92 
Hawai'i 398, 411, 992 P.2d 93, 106 (2000). Summary judgment is 
appropriate if "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of 
law." Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(c). Accordingly, 
"a motion to enforce a settlement agreement may not be decided summarily if there is any question of fact as to whether a 
mutual, valid, and enforceable settlement agreement exists 
between the parties." Moran v. Guerreiro, 97 Hawai' i 354, 371, 
37 P.3d 603, 620 (App. 2001). 
B. Reasonableness of Attorneys' Fees
 
Appellate courts review the reasonableness of a trial
 
court's grant of attorneys' fees and costs for abuse of
 
discretion. Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., 6
 
Haw. App. 431, 436, 726 P.2d 268, 271 (1986).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Brookfield argues that their unilateral mistake as to a
 
basic assumption of the Agreement - that the cost of its
 obligations under the Agreement would approximate $60,000 and not
 
upwards of $200,000 - constitutes a genuine issue of material
 
fact that precluded the circuit court's grant of AOAO's motion to
 
enforce the Agreement. Specifically, Brookfield argues the
 
circuit court erred by (1) failing to recognize a unilateral
 
mistake as a legal basis for raising a genuine issue of material
 
fact in regard to the Agreement, (2) failing to find that
 
Prostor's declaration of unilateral mistake sufficed to raise a
 
5
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
genuine issue of material fact that contests the validity of the
 
Agreement, and (3) awarding attorneys fees to AOAO.
 
One party's mistake about "a basic assumption
 
supporting the contract at the time of its making" renders a
 
contract voidable if: 
the mistake is material and has an adverse effect to the
 
agreed exchange of performances - so long as (1) the
mistaken party has not borne the risk of the mistake and (2)
enforcement of the contract would not [sic][ 
3
] be
unconscionable, or the other party had reason to know of the
mistake or caused the mistake. 
Restatement (Second) of
Contracts Â§ 153, at 394, and Â§ 154, at 402-03 (1979).
Furthermore, where the party seeking relief was not mistaken
but consciously ignored the fact that he or she had limited
knowledge of the facts, he or she effectively bears the risk
of that mistake. Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 154
cmt. c.
 
State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent-All, Inc., 90 Hawai' i 
315, 325, 978 P.2d 753, 763 (1999) (citations omitted and 
emphasis added). 
Under State Farm, Brookfield's alleged unilateral 
mistake would be a "material" issue if (1) Brookfield did not 
bear risk of mistake; and (2) enforcement of the Agreement would 
be unconscionable. 90 Hawai' i at 325; 978 P.2d at 763. 
The circuit court relied on the absence of "mutual
 
mistake" in its decision to grant AOAO's motion to enforce the
 
settlement: 
And what we have here comes down to the â whether or
 
not the parties had a mutual mistake or this is a
mistake on the part of [Brookfield] regarding their
calculation as to the extent of their obligation which
is the pervious concrete. . . . It's unfortunate, but
it does not appear to be any mistake on [AOAO's] part;
and as such, the Court is granting [AOAO's] motion.
This is to enforce the settlement.
 
Brookfield correctly argues that a unilateral mistake
 
may be a basis for raising a genuine issue of material fact about
 
3
 As the citation to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 153 makes
clear, the text should read "(2) enforcement of the contract would be
unconscionable[.]"
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whether mutual assent was reached between the parties in forming 
their Agreement. Upon a showing of mistake, a court may consider 
extrinsic evidence in its inquiry into parties' rights under a 
fully-integrated agreement. See State Farm, 90 Hawai' i at 324, 
978 P.2d at 762. Brookfield argues that Prostor's declaration shows such a material mistake. 
Prostor's declaration states "Brookfield had thoroughly
 
researched the options available to it prior to executing the
 
Settlement Agreement in July 2011 and determined that
 
installation of pervious concrete within the Project's visitor
 
parking and turnaround areas would cost roughly $60,000.00 to
 
$80,000.00" The record shows that grass crete, not pervious
 
concrete, costs upwards of $60,000 and that Brookfield knew prior
 
to entering the Agreement that pervious concrete would cost
 
substantially more than grass crete. On March 15, 2010,
 
Brookfield learned that grass crete installation in the visitor
 
parking stalls (excluding the turnaround areas) would cost
 
approximately $57,000 through its grass crete subcontractor, No
 
Ka Oi Landscape Services. As of December 16, 2010, Brookfield
 
acknowledged that the difference in cost for pervious concrete as
 
compared with grass paving would be "substantial" and negotiated
 
with AOAO to reduce the area to be concrete paved and to obtain
 
$6,000 towards this effort from AOAO.
 
Brookfield's mistake was not a material issue because 
Brookfield bore the risk of its mistake. A party bears the risk 
of mistake if (1) the risk is so allocated in the parties' 
Agreement, (2) the party "has only limited knowledge with respect 
to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats [the 
party's] limited knowledge as sufficient," or (3) the court 
allocates the risk to the party on grounds that are reasonable 
under the circumstances. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., v. Bateman, 82 
Hawai'i 453, 458, 923 P.2d 395, 400 (1996) (citing Restatement 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(Second) of Contracts Â§ 154 at 402-03) amended on reconsideration 
in part by 83 Hawai' i 203, 925 P.2d 373 (1996) (emphasis added). 
Brookfield argues that it does not bear the risk of the
 
4
mistake because the Agreement did not so allocate the risk  and
Prostor's declaration that he had researched price quotes for
 
pervious concrete demonstrates that Brookfield did not enter the
 
Agreement with an awareness of its limited knowledge.
 
The Agreement did not expressly oblige Brookfield to
 
pay a particular price for pervious concrete installation nor
 
allocate to it the risk of pervious concrete price increases. 
On
 
December 16, 2010, AOAO President, Ken Buono, wrote to Jeff
 Proster summarizing their discussions. The email stated that
 
"Brookfield is only committed to do pervious concrete in the
 
turnaround and visitor parking area . . . . The rest will be
 
grass paved. The cost difference is substantial if the [AOAO]
 
wanted it all in pervious concrete." Brookfield subsequently
 
learned that the actual cost difference would be $140,000 Â­
$160,000. Brookfield was aware that pervious concrete would be
 
substantially more than grass crete prior to entering the July
 
2011 Agreement, but was determined to bear the risk of limited
 
knowledge by failing to learn about the actual cost by either
 
procuring subcontractor bids prior to entering the Agreement or
 
investigating the alleged $60,000 - $80,000 low bid of its
 
initial contractor. The $140,000 - $160,000 discrepancy between
 
the initial subcontractor's price quote for pervious concrete
 
installation and subsequent subcontractors' much higher quotes
 
suggests that Brookfield should have investigated the initial low
 
bid, and by failing to do so, bore the risk of entering the
 
Agreement with limited knowledge. See Restatement (Second) of
 
Contracts Â§ 154 (1981); (citing Hankins Const. Co. v. U.S., 838

 The circuit court did not explicitly allocate risk to Brookfield,
but did find that the mistake was exclusively on the part of the Brookfield.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
F.2d 1194, 1196 (1988) (a contractor who was aware that a bid was
 
extremely low, but failed to investigate the bid, bore the risk
 
of entering the contract on such limited knowledge)).
 
Because it bore the risk of entering the Agreement and 
"consciously ignored" its limited knowledge about the actual cost 
of pervious concrete installation, Brookfield's mistake was not a 
material issue that required the circuit court to deny AOAO's 
motion to enforce the Agreement. 90 Hawai' i at 325, 978 P.2d at 
763; compare Honda v. Bd. of Trustees of the Employees' Ret. Sys. of the State of Hawai' i, 108 Hawai' i 212, 219, 118 P.3d 1155, 1162 
(2005) (holding that plaintiff who requested and relied upon defendant's retirement estimates and informational pamphlets 
"was not aware at the time the [employee retirement] contract was 
made that he had only limited knowledge with respect to the facts 
to which the mistake relates.") (internal quotation marks and 
brackets omitted). Because we conclude that Brookfield bore the 
risk of the mistake, we need not address whether enforcement of 
the Agreement would be unconscionable. 
Brookfield argues that "[i]nasmuch as the circuit
 
court's September 12, 2012 Order was in error," the award of
 
$5,325.18 in attorneys' fees to AOAO was an abuse of discretion. 
The Agreement provision entitled, "Breach of Settlement
 
Agreement" states:
 
each non-breaching party may seek to enforce this Agreement
and/or to obtain such other remedies as may be allowed by a
Court. In the event that one or more parties is required to
file suit in a court of law to enforce this Agreement and
prevails in that suit, all reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs incurred as a result of such enforcement shall be the
 responsibility of the losing party or parties.
 
Because we conclude the circuit court did not err,
 
Brookfield's argument is without merit.
