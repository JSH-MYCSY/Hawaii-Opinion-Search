IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHENIEL M.A. NAKAGAWA-PALI, aka Chenlel
M.A. Nakagawa-Pali, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR NO. 12-1-1284)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Cheniel M.A. Nakagawa-Pali, also
 
known as Chenlel M.A. Nakagawa-Pali, appeals from the Judgment of
 
Conviction; Notice of Entry, filed on August 22, 2012, in the
 Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family Court").
1 After a
 
jury trial, the Family Court found Nakagawa-Pali guilty of abuse
 of family or household members pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes § 709-906(1),
2
 and sentenced her, in part, to two years
of probation and two days in jail. 
On appeal, Nakagawa-Pali argues that the Family Court
 
wrongly convicted her where her trial counsel provided
 ineffective assistance for failing to object to (1) a police
 officer's testimony that the complaining witness ("CW") told the
 officer that Nakagawa-Pali attacked the CW and caused him pain,
 and (2) a police officer's single reference to the CW as the
 "victim." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
1/
 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.
 
2/
 HRS § 709-906(1) (Repl. 2014) provides, in relevant part, "It
shall be unlawful for any person . . . to physically abuse a family or
household member . . . ."
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the
 appeal as follows, and affirm: 
(1) Trial counsel elicited hearsay testimony by Officer 
Ty T.K. Ah Nee and failed to object when the State also elicited such testimony from Officer Ah Nee. See Haw. R. Evid. 801 & 803; 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 136, 913 P.2d 57, 62 (1996). 
Nevertheless, any error by trial counsel was harmless where Officer Ah Nee's testimony was cumulative of the CW's written statement to the police, which was received into evidence. See 
State v. Crisostomo, 94 Hawai
'i 282, 290, 12 P.3d 873, 881 
(2000). 
(2) Trial counsel erred by failing to object to Officer 
Mark Kishimoto's single reference to the CW as the "victim." State v. Nomura, 79 Hawai
'i 413, 416, 903 P.2d 718, 721 (App. 
1995). Nevertheless, the error was harmless in light of the substantial evidence—including the CW's statement to the police, photographs of the CW taken by the police, and testimony given at trial—supporting the conviction. See State v. Mundon, 129 
Hawai
'i 1, 26, 292 P.3d 205, 230 (2012) (concluding that 
references by prosecutor and witnesses to the complaining witness as "the victim" were harmless error). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of
 
Conviction; Notice of Entry, filed on August 22, 2012, in the
 Family Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.
