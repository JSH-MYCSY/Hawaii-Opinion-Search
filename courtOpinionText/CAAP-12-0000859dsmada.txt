(2) The record on appeal was filed on December 10,
 
2012, and the appellate clerk informed Appellant that the
 statement of jurisdiction was due by December 20, 2012, and the
 opening brief was due by January 22, 2013; 
(3) Appellant did not file either document; 
(4) On March 14, 2013, the appellate clerk informed 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Rule 30 of the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), the matter would be 
called to the court’s attention on March 25, 2013, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) On April 3, 2013, the court granted Appellant’s
 
motion for relief from default of the statement of jurisdiction
 
and opening brief, and extended the due dates for filing the
 statement of jurisdiction and opening brief to April 15, 2013,
 and May 13, 2013, respectively;
 
(6) On June 3, 2013, because it was unclear whether the
 
appellate clerk mailed the April 3, 2013 order to Appellant, the
 court sua sponte extended the due dates for filing the statement
 of jurisdiction and opening brief to June 13, 2013, and July 13,
 2013, respectively, and ordered the appellate clerk to mail the
 April 3, 2013 and June 3, 2013 orders to Appellant;

June 3, 2013 orders to Appellant;
 
(8) Appellant filed a statement of jurisdiction on 
June 13, 2013;

 Thereafter, Appellant did not file the opening
 
brief. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed,
 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 30.
