Defendants-Appellants Alberto C. Timosan, Simplicia C.

Timosan, Ariel Timosan, Archangel Timosan  and Ailyn Timosan
Ounyoung (collectively, Appellants) appeal from: 
(1) the "Order 1) Denying Defendant's Motion To
 
Dismiss Filed January 10, 2012[;] 2) Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 for Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession Filed November 14,
 2011," the "Judgment for Possession," and the "Writ of
 Possession," all entered April 27, 2012 (collectively, Summary
 Judgment Order); and

(2) the "Order Denying Defendants' [District Court
 
Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP)] Rule 60(b)(3) and (4) Motion to
 
Set Aside This Court's (1) April 27, 2012 Order Granting Summary
 Judgment And Writ of Possession, (2) April 27, 2012 Judgment For
 Possession, And (3) April 27, 2012 Writ of Possession, For
 Sanctions, And For Discovery[,]" entered September 18, 2012
 (DCRCP Rule 60(b) Motion). All judgments and orders were entered
 
2
in the District Court of the Third Circuit  (district court).
Because Appellants filed their notice of appeal on 
October 18, 2012, only the appeal from the DCRCP Rule 60(b) Motion is timely. See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
4(a)(1). 
On appeal, Appellants contend the district court lacked
 
subject matter jurisdiction, rendering its prior orders and
 judgments void, because: (1) title was at issue, depriving the
 district court of jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of
 New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, FKA the Bank
 of New York Trust Company, N.A. as Successor to JPMorgan Chase
 N.A. as Trustee for RAMP 2005RS9 (RAMP) lacked standing to pursue
 ejectment as a matter of law, (3) RAMP committed fraud, (4)
 RAMP's attorneys' affirmation was false, and (5) discovery was
 required on all standing issues.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Appellants' appeal is without merit.
(1) The district court's denial of Appellants' DCRCP
Rule 60(b) Motion was proper because the Summary Judgment Order
was not void.
 
The district court's denial of Appellants' DCRCP Rule 
60(b) Motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Beneficial 
Hawaii, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai
'i 159, 164, 45 P.3d 359, 364 
(2002). An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or

principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
 
party litigant. See id. 
DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4) provides a party relief from a
 
"final judgment, order, or proceeding . . . [if] . . . the
 judgment is void[.]" A judgment is void "if the court that
 rendered it lacked jurisdiction of . . . the subject
 matter . . . ." Application of Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141,
 
146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982). 
Appellants contend the Summary Judgment Order is void
 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because (1) Appellants
 presented a question of title to the district court, and (2) RAMP
 lacked standing to bring the summary possession and ejectment
 action. We conclude the denial was not erroneous, in that the
 district court had subject matter jurisdiction and RAMP had
 standing.
 
(a) The district court had subject matter jurisdiction.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d) (Supp. 2012) 
precludes district courts from exercising jurisdiction "in which 
the title to real estate comes in question[.]" If a defendant in an ejectment action seeks to raise a defense to the court's jurisdiction on the ground that title to real estate is in dispute, the defendant must comply with DCRCP Rule 12.1.
3 See 
Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai 'i 32, 33, 265 
P.3d 1128, 1129 (2011). DCRCP Rule 12.1 aims to prevent abuse of HRS § 604-5(d) by requiring an affidavit describing the claim to

 DCRCP Rule 12.1 provides :
 
Rule 12.1 DEFENSE OF TITLE IN DISTRICT COURTS.
 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.

title with specificity. Peelua, 126 Hawai 'i at 36, 265 P.3d at 
1132. Bare assertions that title is at issue are insufficient to 
divest the district court of jurisdiction. Id. at 38, 265 P.3d 
at 1134. Appellants contend they satisfied the requirements of DCRCP Rule 12.1 by "pointing out that there were deficiencies in how [RAMP] acquired title to their note and mortgage." 
In opposition to the summary possession and ejectment
 
action, Alberta and Simplicia asserted three main claims: 
(1) the "Mortgagee's Grant Deed Pursuant to Power of
 
Sale" raises a question of fact about whether the note was
 assigned or delivered to RAMP, and cites Carpenter v. Longan, 83
 U.S. 271, 274 (1872) for the proposition that the "note and
 mortgage are inseparable; the former as essential, the latter as
 an incident. An assignment of the note carries the mortgage with
 it, while an assignment of the latter alone is a nullity[;]" 
(2) based on the record, a genuine issue of material
 
fact exists regarding whether RAMP is the "lawful owner and
 holder of the note and/or mortgage[;]" and 
(3) RAMP did not prove it has any rights as holder to
 
enforce the note or mortgage per HRS § 490:3-301 (2008 Repl.) or
 UCC Article 3 §§ 3-301, 3-302.
 
In opposition to the action for summary possession and
 
ejectment, Ounyoung asserted three main claims: 
(1) a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding
 
whether RAMP holds good title to the Property because RAMP did
 not "have proper Chain of Title; 
(2) a question exists "as to whom has the right proper
 
quitclaim deed, [Ounyoung or RAMP;]" and 
(3) the district court lacked subject matter
 
jurisdiction.
 
In opposition to RAMP's proposed order denying
 
Ounyoung's motion to dismiss and granting RAMP's motion for
 summary judgment, Ounyoung asserted: 
(1) RAMP lacked "standing to foreclose and is not the
 
holder in due course evidence by the promissory note[;]" and 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) the district court lacked "subject matter
 
jurisdiction under [DCRCP] Rule 12.1 based upon [Ounyoung] having
 
special interest on title."
 
Ounyoung submitted what appears to be a title report to
 
the district court. 
Significantly, however, no affidavit appears
 
of record regarding the source, nature, and extent of the title
 to the Property claimed by any Appellant. Because Appellants
 failed to submit an affidavit per DCRCP Rule 12.1, they could not
 raise a title dispute as a defense. See State ex rel. Dep't of
 
Hawaiian Home Lands v. Pedro, No. CAAP-12-0000444 (App. June 28,
 2013) (SDO) (holding defendants failed to submit, at any time, an
 affidavit providing the particulars about the source, nature or
 extent of their claim to title and thus could not raise a title
 dispute as a defense). Furthermore, Appellant's failed to
 sufficiently identify the source, nature, and extent of the title
 claimed.
 
To satisfy DCRCP Rule 12.1, a defendant's affidavit 
must identify a claimed interest in the subject property existing "at the time a defense under DCRCP Rule 12.1 is raised." Peelua, 
126 Hawai
'i at 38 n.14, 265 P.3d at 1134 n.14. So while a title 
report may identify the source, nature, and extent of title once held, it does not identify an existing interest where the subject property has been conveyed through a non-judicial foreclosure sale. To meet the requirements of DCRCP Rule 12.1 in such a situation, as here, defendants must specifically identify a claim to title that survives the non-judicial foreclosure. See 
generally U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, SCWC-11-0001104, SCWC­11-0001105, 2013 WL 5967013 (Haw. Nov. 8, 2013). 
In the case at bar, Appellants failed to identify the
 
alleged break in RAMP's chain of title with any specificity. See
 
id. at *11 ("Permitting the type of vague, speculative
 hypotheticals of a defect in the chain of title that the
 [defendants] assert would contravene the purpose of [DCRCP Rule
 12.1], which is to apprise the court fully of the nature of the
 defendant's claim[.]" (citation and internal quotation marks
 omitted)). The bare assertion that RAMP lacked standing to
 foreclose is too speculative to sufficiently apprise the district
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court of the claimed interest in the Property. See Fed. Nat'l
 
Mortg. Ass'n v. Medeiros, No. CAAP-12-0000024 at *3 (App. May 7,
 
2013) (mem.) ("The declaration simply asserts that there was an
 'apparent violation of Federal law,' but as in Peelua, without
 further detail it cannot be ascertained how or whether the
 allegation has any bearing on title to the property.")
(b) RAMP had standing to pursue ejectment.
 
Appellants' DCRCP Rule 60(b) Motion contended the 
Summary Judgment Order was void and should be set aside under DCRCP Rule 60(b)(4) because RAMP was not a holder of the note and therefore lacked standing to pursue ejectment as a matter of law. A plaintiff has the right to bring suit, and thus standing, when "(1) the plaintiff has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant's wrongful conduct, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's actions, and (3) a favorable decision would likely provide relief for a plaintiff's injury." See IndyMac Bank v. Miguel, 117 Hawai
'i 506, 512, 184 P.3d 821, 
827 (App. 2008) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). If a party lacks standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to decide the action. See id. 
Appellants contend: 
Under the common law, a "mortgagee" or person entitled
to enforce a mortgage must also be the holder of the secured
promissory note. Generally, possession of an indorsed
promissory note, in compliance with the requirements of
Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (adopted in
Hawaii as Chapter 490:3) is essential before an entity may
conduct a foreclosure. However, the Timosans and Ounyoung
maintained that [RAMP] was not the holder of their
promissory note at the time of the nonjudicial foreclosure.
The disputed Assignment of Mortgage is wholly insufficient
to establish this elemental fact.
 
This contention posits that RAMP did not suffer an actual injury 
because RAMP did not hold good title to the Property. This contention is without merit because Hawai
'i's former non-judicial 
foreclosure act does not require a mortgagee to affirmatively prove that it holds the note. See Pascual v. Aurora Loan 
Services, LLC, CIV. No. 10-00759 JMS-KS, 2012 WL 3583530 at *3 (D. Haw. Aug. 20, 2012) ("According to its plain language, HRS §
 667-5 contains no requirement that a mortgagee affirmatively
 prove that it holds the note.").

Appellants also contend the original lender's
 
bankruptcy invalidated the assignment of the mortgage on the
 
Property from Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.,
 nominee for the original lender, to the Bank of New York, RAMP's
 predecessor in interest. This contention is also without merit. 
Appellants produced no evidence that the assignment violated the
 bankruptcy stay, alleging only that the assignment occurred
 sometime after the original lender filed for bankruptcy. A
 nominee's assignment of a mortgage while the principal is in
 bankruptcy does not automatically violate 11 U.S.C. § 362. See
 
Pascual v. Aurora Loan Services, LLC, CIV. No. 10-00759 JMS-KSC,
 2012 WL 2355531 (D. Haw. June 19, 2012) reconsideration denied,
 CIV. No. 10-00759 JMS-KSC, 2012 WL 3583530 (D. Haw. Aug. 20,
 2012) ("Assuming that Plaintiffs' mortgage loan was part of [the
 lender's] bankruptcy estate,[] [the lender's] filing of Chapter
 11 bankruptcy permitted it to continue to operate its business in
 the ordinary course.") (citing 11 U.S.C. §§ 1107(a), 1108).
 
Additionally, where a mortgage instrument assigns
 
transfer rights to the nominee before the principal filed for
 bankruptcy, as here, the principal's subsequent bankruptcy filing
 does not automatically invalidate the nominee's assignment. See
 
Camat v. Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass'n, CIV. No. 12-00149 SOM/BMK, 2012
 WL 2370201 at *7 (D. Haw. June 22, 2012) (holding homeowner's
 contention, that the assignment of a mortgage by a nominee for
 lender was invalid because the assignment occurred while lender
 was in bankruptcy, was without a factual basis because the
 lender's "bankruptcy did not on its own affect the validity of
 the assignment because [the lender] transferred its beneficial
 interest in the mortgage to [the nominee] before instituting the
 bankruptcy proceedings.").
 
In support of its "Motion for Summary Judgment And Writ
 
Of Possession" RAMP attached its "Mortgagee's Affidavit Of
 Foreclosure Under Power Of Sale," "Mortgagee's Grant Deed
 Pursuant To Power Of Sale," the Mortgage, and two recorded
 mortgage assignments. Based on this record, we conclude RAMP
 held good title to the Property and therefore suffered actual,
 redressable injury when Appellants refused to vacate. See

generally Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Himalaya-Fidele, No. 29905
 
(App. April 30, 2013) (SDO).
(2) The district court did not abuse its discretion
when it denied Appellants' DCRCP Rule 60(b) Motion because
Appellants failed to present competent evidence of fraud.
 
DCRCP Rule 60(b)(3) provides relief from a judgment if 
the judgment was procured through intrinsic or extrinsic fraud, 
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party. See 
DCRCP Rule 60(b)(3); see also Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai
'i 214, 251, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092 (1997).4 
Kawamata Farms explained the burden a Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(3) movant must satisfy for the judgment to be set aside: 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3) is essentially identical to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 60(b)(3). Where we have
 
patterned a rule of procedure after an equivalent rule
within the FRCP, interpretations of the rule "by the federal
courts are deemed to be highly persuasive in the reasoning
of this court." Harada v. Burns, 50 Haw. 528, 532, 445 P.2d
376, 380 (1968) (footnote omitted). According to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, "[u]nder
[FRCP] Rule 60(b)(3), the movant must, (1) prove by clear
and convincing evidence that the verdict was obtained
through fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct
[, and] (2) establish that the conduct complained of prevented
the losing party from fully and fairly presenting his case or
defense." Jones v. Aero/Chem Corp., 921 F.2d 875, 878–79 (9th
Cir.1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)[.]
 
Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai 'i at 251-52, 948 P.2d at 1092-93. 
(Emphasis added.) The district court found Appellants failed to 
satisfy both requirements. 
Appellants alleged RAMP knew its title to the Property
 
was not good and therefore, RAMP's "knowingly contrary
 affirmations constitute fraud not only upon Movants, but upon
 [the district court.]" As previously discussed, Appellants'
 attack of RAMP's title to the Property is without merit; so too
 are Appellants' related claims of fraud.
 
4
 We note that the text of HRCP Rule 60(b) and DCRCP Rule 60(b) are
materially alike. See Bank of Hawaii v. Shaw, 83 Hawai' i 50, 55, 924 P.2d
544, 549 (App. 1996).

(3) RAMP's attorneys' affirmation.
 
Appellants contend RAMP's attorneys submitted an
 
"affirmation at the beginning of the case that was clearly
 
false." Appellants' contention that the affirmation was false
 appears to be based on Appellants' claim that RAMP did not hold
 good title, which as previously discussed, is without merit.
(4) Discovery was not required on all standing issues.
 
Appellants contend discovery "was obviously
 
warranted . . . to determine the real standing/jurisdictional
 
facts of this case[.]" This claim again appears to be based on
 Appellants' claim that RAMP did not hold good title, which is
 without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that "Order Denying Defendants'
 
Rule 60(b)(3) and (4) Motion to Set Aside This Court's (1) April
 27, 2012 Order Granting Summary Judgment And Writ of Possession,
 (2) April 27, 2012 Judgment For Possession, And (3) April 27,
 2012 Writ of Possession, For Sanctions, And For Discovery"
 entered September 18, 2012 in the District Court of the Third
 Circuit is affirmed.
