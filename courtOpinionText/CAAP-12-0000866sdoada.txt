(Circuit Court)2
 on September 21, 2012.  As explained below, we
 
dismiss the appeal because we conclude that the Bassans lack

 
standing to pursue the appeal. 
I.

 
The Bassans, Citrus Management Services, Inc., and
 
Orchard Services, Inc. (collectively, "Borrowers") borrowed
 
$625,300 from Plaintiff-Appellee Federal Land Bank Association of
 Hawaii, FLCA (FLBA).
3 To provide security for the loan, the
 
Bassans gave FLBA a mortgage encumbering the subject property in
 this case (Subject Property). Borrowers eventually defaulted on
 their payment obligations. 
On June 13, 2005, FLBA filed its complaint seeking to 
recover amounts owed and a decree of foreclosure. On February 21, 2008, FLBA filed a motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure against all defendants on all claims (FLBA's Motion for Summary Judgment). On April 2, 2008, the Circuit Court orally granted FLBA's Motion for Summary Judgment. On April 23, 2008, the Bassans filed notice of their filing of a Chapter 12 bankruptcy proceeding (First Bankruptcy Proceeding) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawai
'i (Bankruptcy 
Court) and the resulting automatic stay of the Circuit Court proceedings. On October 28, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Bassans' amended Chapter 12 Plan in their First Bankruptcy Proceeding. However, on February 3, 2011, FLBA notified the Circuit Court that the Bankruptcy Court had dismissed the First

2The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided. 
3According to FLBA, Morton E. Bassan, Jr. served as President of both
Citrus Management Services, Inc. and Orchard Services, Inc., and Keiko Bassan
served as Vice-President of Citrus Management Services, Inc. and as Treasurer
of Orchard Services, Inc.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Bankruptcy Proceeding on December 3, 2010, and that the automatic
 
stay was no longer in effect. 
On February 15, 2011, the Circuit Court entered its 
written "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting [FLBA's] Motion for Summary Judgment and for Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on All Claims Filed February 21, 2008" (Order Granting FLBA's Motion for Summary Judgment). The Circuit Court concluded that as of February 12, 2008, Borrowers owed FLBA $935,991.55, and that additional amounts in interest, advances, expenses, fees, and costs would be subject to later determination. Pursuant to the Order Granting FLBA's Motion for Summary Judgment, the Circuit Court, on February 15, 2011, filed its Judgment entering summary judgment in favor of FLBA and against all defendants, including the Bassans. The Circuit Court certified the February 15, 2011, Judgment as a final judgment pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 54(b) (2000). The Bassans did not appeal from the February 15, 2011, Judgment. 
On July 12, 2011, FLBA notified the Circuit Court that
 
the Bassans had filed a second Chapter 12 bankruptcy proceeding
 (Second Bankruptcy Proceeding) on July 8, 2011, in the Bankruptcy
 Court, which automatically stayed the Circuit Court proceedings. 
On November 3, 2011, FLBA notified the Circuit Court that the
 Bankruptcy Court, on October 11, 2011, had issued an order
 granting FLBA's motion for relief from the automatic stay. The
 Bankruptcy Court's order permitted FLBA to exercise its
 foreclosure and other rights relating to the Debtors (the
 Bassans) and their property, but provided that no deficiency
 judgment shall enter against Debtors without further order of the
 Bankruptcy Court. 
On November 9, 2011, the Subject Property was sold at a
 
public auction to FLBA through a credit bid. On February 23,
 2012, the Circuit Court entered an order confirming the sale as
 well as a Judgment pursuant to that order, which the Circuit 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court certified as a final judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). 
The Bassans did not appeal from the February 23, 2012 Judgment.
 
In the meantime, the Bassans' Second Bankruptcy
 
Proceeding was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding on October 12,
 2011. On February 2, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order
 granting "[a] discharge of the debtor(s)" in the Second
 Bankruptcy Proceeding. On March 6, 2012, FLBA and Diane S.
 Field, Chapter 7 Trustee for the Bassans (Bankruptcy Trustee),
 entered into a "Release and Settlement Agreement" (Settlement
 Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Bankruptcy
 Trustee released and discharged FLBA from any and all of the
 Bassans' pre-petition claims and causes of action against FLBA. 
By order filed on April 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court granted
 the Bankruptcy Trustee's motion to approve the Settlement
 Agreement.
 
On August 12, 2012, the Bassans filed their motion to
 
reconsider the Circuit Court's Order Granting FLBA's Motion for
 Summary Judgment filed on February 15, 2011, and to set aside or
 stay the Commissioner's Deed related thereto (Motion for
 Reconsideration). FLBA opposed the Bassans' Motion for
 Reconsideration, arguing, among other things, that any claims
 asserted by the Bassans in their motion belonged to the Bassans'
 Bankruptcy Trustee and were released by the Bankruptcy Trustee
 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. On September 21, 2012, the
 Circuit Court filed its Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration,
 and this appeal followed.
 
II.
 
On appeal, the Bassans argue that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying their Motion for Reconsideration because they
 had equitable defenses to the FLBA's foreclosure action,
 including defenses arising out of the Farm Credit Act. We
 conclude, however, that the Bassans lack standing to pursue their
 appeal. We therefore dismiss their appeal without resolving the
 merits of their arguments.

In Bismark Mortg. Co., LLC v. Pai, No. CAAP-11-0000343,
 
2014 WL 2008497 (Hawai 'i App. May 16, 2004) (SDO), we explained 
the effect of a debtor's filing for bankruptcy as follows:
 
Subject to certain exemptions that are not relevant in
this case, . . . when a petitioner files a bankruptcy
petition with the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy estate
that is thereby created includes "all legal or equitable
interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement
of the case." 11 U.S.C. 541(a)(1) (emphasis added).
 
In The Queen Emma Foundation v. Tatibouet, 123 Hawai' i 
500, 509, 236 P.3d 1236, 1245 (App. 2010), this court
recognized that "[v]irtually all of a debtor's assets,
including causes of action that belong to the debtor at the
commencement of a bankruptcy case, vest in the bankruptcy
estate upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition." (Citing
11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1) (2006); Turner v. Cook, 362 F.3d 1219,
1225–26 (9th Cir. 2004)). In Turner, the Ninth Circuit
stated in unambiguous terms,
 
[b]ecause [the appellant] has filed for bankruptcy
. . . he is no longer a real party in interest in this
matter and has no standing to pursue this appeal.
When Turner declared bankruptcy, all the "legal or
equitable interests" he had in his property became the
property of the bankruptcy estate and are represented
by the bankruptcy trustee. See 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1).
Causes of action are among such legal or equitable
interests.
 
Turner, 362 F.3d at 1225–26; see Rowland v. Novus Fin.
Corp., 949 F.Supp. 1447, 1453–54 (D. Haw. 1996) (holding
that plaintiff lacked standing to assert Truth in Lending
Act claims because he filed for bankruptcy and the claim was
the property of the bankruptcy estate, unless plaintiff
could show the claim was exempt from the bankruptcy estate
or abandoned by the bankruptcy trustee).
 
Bismark Mort., 2014 WL 2008497, at *2-3.
 
Here, when the Bassans filed their Second Bankruptcy
Proceeding on July 8, 2011, all their non-exempt legal and
 
equitable interests, including any interests in the Subject
 Property and any causes of action they had against FLBA, became
 property of the bankruptcy estate. The record reflects that in
 their Second Bankruptcy Proceeding, the Bassans were granted a
 discharge in bankruptcy. The record further reflects that
 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Bankruptcy Trustee
 released and discharged FLBA from any and all claims and causes
 of action that the Bassans had against FLBA before they filed
 their Second Bankruptcy Proceeding. The Bassans only asserted

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pre-petition claims in support of their Motion for
 
Reconsideration. 
Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Bassans
 
have not shown that they possess any remaining interest in the
 Subject Property or in the claims they asserted against FLBA in
 support of their Motion for Reconsideration. Accordingly, we
 conclude that the Bassans lack standing to pursue their appeal,
 
see id; Sierra Club v. Hawai 'i Tourism Auth., 100 Hawai 'i 242, 
250, 59 P.3d 877, 885 (2002), and we therefore dismiss their
 appeal.
