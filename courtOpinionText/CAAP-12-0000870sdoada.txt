Waipahu, Hawai 'i (the Property). Sakuma is challenging the 
denial of her June 7, 2012 Motion for Reconsideration of the May 
29, 2012 Order Confirming Sale, which is set forth in the Circuit Court's November 30, 2015 Order Denying Defendant Patsy N. Sakuma's Motion for Reconsideration of the May 29, 2012 Order Confirming Sale. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 conclude that Sakuma's appeal is moot.
 
"'[M]ootness is an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.'" State v. Nakanelua, 134 
Hawai
'i 489, 501, 345 P.3d 155, 167 (2015) (quoting Hamilton ex 
rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai 'i 1, 4–5, 193 P.3d 839, 842–43 
(2008)). 
Thus, before reaching Sakuma's points of error, we
 
address whether the mootness doctrine applies to the instant
 case.
 
The general rule is that the right of a good faith
purchaser "to receive property acquired at a judicial sale
cannot be affected by the reversal of an order ratifying the
sale where a [supersedeas] bond has not been filed[.]"
Leisure Campground & Country Club Ltd. Partnership v.
Leisure Estates, 280 Md. 220, 223, 372 A.2d 595, 598 (1977).
See also Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin. Corp., 645 F.2d
333, 336 (5th Cir. 1981). The purpose of the rule is to
advance "the stability and productiveness of judicial sales
[.]" 47 Am.Jur.2d Judicial Sales § 55 (1969). An exception
to the rule is where the reversal is based on jurisdictional
grounds. Id. at § 54. The second exception is where the
purchaser is the mortgagee since he "does not free himself
from the underlying dispute to which he is a party [.]"
Leisure Campground, 280 Md. at 223, 372 A.2d at 598. See
 
also 47 Am.Jur.2d Judicial Sales §§ 59–61.
 
City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. 130, 133, 748 P.2d 
812, 814 (1988). See also Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai 'i 307, 
313, 141 P.3d 480, 486 (2006) ("[T]he sale of the property prevents the appellate court from granting any effective relief."). "Moreover, 'it is appellant's burden to seek a stay if post-appeal transactions could render the appeal moot.'" Id.

The record on appeal includes the Distribution 
Statement and Account of Commissioner; Exhibit "A" (Distribution 
Statement) and Certificate of Service, filed on July 2, 2012. 
The Distribution Statement confirms that the sale of the Property 
was closed, through Title Guaranty Escrow Services, Inc., on July 2, 2012. Sakuma failed to obtain a stay of the sale transaction, the completed sale of the Property rendered this appeal moot, and, upon review, no exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply. Lathrop, 111 Hawai
'i 313-15, 141 P.3d 486-88. 
Accordingly, we dismiss Sakuma's appeal as moot.
