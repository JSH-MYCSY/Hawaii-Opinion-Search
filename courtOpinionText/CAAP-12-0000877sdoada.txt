On June 18, 1998, a jury found Jenkins guilty of
 
Robbery in the First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes § 708-840(b)(i) (1993); Kidnapping, in violation of HRS
 § 707-720(1)(c) (1993); and Burglary in the First Degree, in
 violation of HRS § 708-810(1)(a) (1993). Jenkins was sentenced
 as a repeat offender to the mandatory minimum terms, including a
 twenty-year indeterminate term for Robbery in the First Degree, a
 twenty-year indeterminate term for Kidnapping, and a ten-year

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
indeterminate term for Burglary in the First Degree, all 
sentences to run concurrently. On appeal, by memorandum opinion dated January 18, 2001, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court affirmed 
Jenkins' conviction but vacated his sentences because he did not qualify as a repeat offender for sentencing purposes under HRS § 706-606.5 (Supp. 2007). State of Hawai
'i v. Jenkins, No. 21729, 
slip op. at 34–35 (Hawai 'i Jan. 18, 2001). On June 14, 2001, the 
Circuit Court issued an Amended Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence, in which it re-sentenced Jenkins as it had previously, but removed the labels of such terms as mandatory minimums pursuant to sentencing as a repeat offender. 
On June 13, 2008, Jenkins filed a Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 Custody ("First Petition"), pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii
 Rules of Penal Procedure. In the First Petition, Jenkins claimed
 that his constitutional right to effective assistance of trial
 counsel was violated, that trial counsel failed to appeal his
 convictions, that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing
 to raise ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, and that
 his convictions were illegally obtained. On October 10, 2008,
 the Circuit Court denied the First Petition without a hearing. 
On November 6, 2008, Jenkins filed a Motion for
 
Reconsideration. On December 12, 2008, the Circuit Court denied
 Jenkins' Motion for Reconsideration. Jenkins did not appeal from
 the denial of his First Petition or the denial of his Motion for
 Reconsideration of the First Petition.
 
On September 14, 2009, Jenkins filed a Motion to Amend
 
Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief ("Second Petition"). 
Jenkins sought to amend the First Petition to include three
 additional claims: that his trial counsel was ineffective for
 failing to object to erroneous jury instructions, that trial
 counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction
 on merger of Robbery in the First Degree and Kidnapping, and that
 appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue
 of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for the above issues. 
On October 29, 2009, the Circuit Court denied the Motion to Amend
 Rule 40 Petition without a hearing on the ground that there was
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
no authority that allowed amendment of the First Petition after
 
expiration of the time to appeal had passed. On appeal, by
 summary disposition order dated April 13, 2011, this court
 reversed the Circuit Court and ordered that Jenkins's Second
 Petition be treated as a separate non-conforming HRPP Rule 40
 Petition. Jenkins v. State, No. 30196, 2011 WL 1421150 at *1
 
(Haw. Ct. App. Apr. 13, 2011). 
On May 25, 2011, Jenkins filed a Supplemental Amendment 
to Clarify Motion to Amend Petition Filed on September 14, 2009 ("Supplemental Amendment"). Citing State v. Radcliffe, 9 Haw. App. 628, 859 P.2d 925 (1993), Jenkins contended that the Circuit Court plainly erred by instructing the jury that "a knife is a dangerous instrument." Also citing State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai
'i 17, 
881 P.2d 504 (1994), Jenkins claimed that the jury should have been instructed on the possibility of merger of the Robbery in the First Degree and Kidnapping charges, and that he could not be convicted of both counts pursuant to HRS § 701-109(1)(e). 
On October 4, 2012, the Circuit Court issued its
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order: (1) Granting
 Motion for Disposition to Rule 40 Petition; (2) Denying Petition
 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody; (3) Denying Motion for Peremptory
 Reversal; and (4) Denying Motion for Appointment of Counsel,
 which denied the Second Petition without a hearing. On appeal,
 Jenkins asserts the same claims that he raised in his Second
 Petition as modified by the Supplemental Amendment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Jenkins's points of error as follows and affirm:
 
The Circuit Court did not err in denying the Second
 
Petition after reviewing it on remand, which it did on the ground
 
2
that Jenkins's claims were waived  because Jenkins failed to
2
 The Circuit Court's Conclusion of Law 7 states as follows:
 
Under HRPP Rule 40, relief is unavailable as to issues that
could be, but were not raised on appeal. The Petitioner
 could have raised his claims in a direct appeal. However,
the Petitioner failed to raise the claims, or present any

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
rebut the presumption that the failure to raise the claim in the
 
First Petition was a "knowing [] and understanding [] fail[ure]"
 and that he failed to prove "extraordinary circumstances to
 justify [his] failure to raise" the claims. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3)
 states:
 
(3) INAPPLICABILITY. Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled
upon or were waived. Except for a claim of illegal sentence,
an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and
understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been
raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under
this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the
petitioner's failure to raise the issue. There is a
rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(a)(3). Jenkins did not state in the Second
 
Petition why he failed to raise the issue of incorrect jury
 instructions in the First Petition, nor did he prove the
 existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure
 to raise the claims in the First Petition.
3 Therefore, relief
 
was not available pursuant to HRPP Rule 40.
 
Therefore,

 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order: (1) Granting Motion for
 Disposition to Rule 40 Petition; (2) Denying Petition to Vacate,
 Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 Custody; (3) Denying Motion for Peremptory Reversal; and (4)
 Denying Motion for Appointment of Counsel, entered on October 4,
 
facts to rebut the presumption that the failure to raise the
claim was a "knowing and understanding failure," or prove
any extraordinary circumstance that would justify his
failure to raise the claim in an appeal. Therefore, the
Court finds and concludes that Petitioner's claims are
 waived.

 Even if we were to conclude that Jenkins stated a colorable claim 
regarding the jury instruction (reviewed for plain error) or the lack of amerger instruction, either of which would otherwise entitle him to a hearingin the Circuit Court, it would not affect his conviction on the kidnappingcharge, and thus would afford him no practical relief. Therefore, those
claims are moot. See Kaho' ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai' i 302, 332, 162 P.3d
696, 726 (2007) (observing that "[a] case is moot if the reviewing court canno longer grant effective relief.") (citing City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7
Haw. App. 130, 134, 748 P.2d 812, 815 (1988)).
