IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MARK CHAR, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 03-1-2555)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals from the 
September 24, 2012 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
Granting Defendant-Appellee Mark Char's (Char's) Motion to 
Dismiss (Order), entered in the Circuit Court of the First 
1
Circuit  (Circuit Court). Char brought his Motion to Dismiss 
pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48(b). 
The State raises two points of error on appeal: 
(1) The Circuit Court erred in granting Char's Motion

 
to Dismiss under HRPP Rule 48(b), specifically including that the
 
Circuit Court's Conclusions of Law (COLs) 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 are
 
wrong; and
 
(2) The Circuit Court abused its discretion in
 
granting Char's Motion to Dismiss with prejudice.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve the State's points of error as follows:
 
Char argues that this case is moot. "'[M]ootness is an 
issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law[.]'" State v. 
Nakanelua, 134 Hawai
'i 489, 501, 345 P.3d 155, 167 (2015) 
(citation omitted). Thus, before reaching the State's points of error, we address whether the mootness doctrine applies to the instant case. 
Char argues that because he "was originally sentenced
 
to three years probation nun [sic] pro tunc and had completely
 served that sentence prior to any re-trial in this matter[,]
 [t]his case is therefore moot as to any re-trial based upon HRS
 § 706-609."

"[A] case is moot where the question to be determined is
abstract and does not rest on existing facts or rights."State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 424 n.13, 984 P.2d 1231,
1250 n.13 (1999). Hence, "the mootness doctrine is properlyinvoked where events have so affected relations between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevanton appeal—adverse interest and effective remedy—have beencompromised." Id. 
State v. Durham, 125 Hawai 'i 114, 127, 254 P.3d 425, 438 (2011). 
"[The supreme court], however, recognized three exceptions to the 
mootness doctrine: matters capable of repetition yet evading review, matters affecting the public interest, and matters posingcollateral consequences for the defendant." State v. Kiese, 126 
Hawai
'i 494, 508-09, 273 P.3d 1180, 1194-95 (2012) (footnotes 
omitted, emphasis added).

 HRS § 706-609 (2014) provides:
 
§ 706-609 Resentence for the same offense or for
 
offense based on the same conduct not to be more severe than
 
prior sentence.  When a conviction or sentence is set aside
 
on direct or collateral attack, the court shall not impose a
new sentence for the same offense, or for a different
offense based on the same conduct, which is more severe than
the prior sentence.

3See also, e.g., Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 371 n.2, 113
S. Ct. 2130, 2135 n.2 (1993) (holding that where a criminal defendant had
successfully completed a two-year probation under a diversionary sentencing
statute and the original charges had been dismissed, the State's appeal was
not moot.  "[Defendant] argues that the case has been rendered moot by the
dismissal of the original criminal charges.  We often have observed, however,
that the possibility of a criminal defendant's suffering collateral legal
consequences from a sentence already served precludes a finding of mootness.
. . . [W]e must conclude that reinstatement of the record of the charges

3In State v. Tierney , 127 Hawai #i 157, 277 P.3d 251
(2012), a petitioner who had been convicted of a misdemeanor drug
charge appealed from the Intermediate Court of Appeals' (ICA's)
judgment affirming the Circuit Court's judgment of conviction and
sentence.  Although neither party raised the issue of mootness,
the supreme court analyzed whether the mootness doctrine was
applicable to the appeal, holding that the petitioner's appeal
was not moot despite the fact that he had already completely
served his sentence because his conviction was "reasonably likely
to result in collateral consequences":
A case is also not moot if there is a reasonable probability
that there will be prejudicial collateral consequences for
the parties.  In re Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem , 119
Hawai#i 1, 193 P.3d 839 (2008). 
. . . . 
[U]nless reviewed, Petitioner's conviction is
reasonably likely to result in collateral consequences. 
Criminal convictions have collateral consequences even after
sentences have been served.  See Sibron v. New York, 392
U.S. 40, 55–56, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968)
("Although [a defendant's prison] term has been served, the
results of the conviction may persist.  Subsequent
convictions may carry heavier penalties; civil rights may be
affected.  As the power to remedy an invalid sentence
exists, a defendant is entitled to an opportunity to attempt
to show that his conviction was invalid.") (internal
citation omitted) (cited approvingly in Spencer v. Kemna,
523 U.S. 1, 25, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)). 
Here, Petitioner could have been acquitted by reason of
physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect, see HRS §
704–402 (1993), rather than found guilty, or, conceivably,
the charge could have been dismissed if Petitioner remained
unfit to proceed.  Petitioner's conviction adds to his
criminal record, and could result in lengthier future
criminal penalties.  These collateral consequences prevent
Petitioner's case from becoming moot.  Cf. Lethem,  119
Hawai#i at 8, 193 P.3d at 846 (holding case was not moot
although domestic violence temporary restraining order had
expired because there was a reasonable probability that the
order could affect defendant's reputation).
Tierney, 127 Hawai# i at 172-73, 277 P.3d at 266-67 (footnotes
omitted).3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, this court's earlier Summary Disposition Order
 
and Judgment vacated the Circuit Court's December 6, 2006
 
Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence; thus, Char's
 earlier conviction does not currently appear on Char's criminal
 record. Therefore, while it is true that under HRS § 706-609,
 Char could not be subjected to a more severe sentence than the
 three years probation he already served, HRS § 706-609 does not
 preclude Char from again being convicted of Negligent Injury in
 the First Degree, a felony, upon re-trial. 
Although Char is no longer subject to additional
 
punishment under HRS § 706-609, the State continues to have an
 interest in securing a felony conviction against Char. Unless
 reviewed, the lack of a felony conviction on Char's record is
 "reasonably likely to result in collateral consequences." 
Tierney, 127 Hawai 'i at 172, 277 P.3d at 266. 
Turning to the State's first point of error, HRPP
 
Rule 48(b) provides, in relevant part:
 
(b) By Court.  Except in the case of traffic offenses
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on
motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without
 
3(...continued)
against respondent would carry collateral legal consequences and that,

therefore, a live controversy remains.") (internal citations and quotation
marks omitted); State v. Jordan, 716 A.2d 1004, 1006-07 (Me. 1998) (holding
that although defendant's conviction had been vacated and defendant had fully
served the sentence imposed in the first trial, the State's "interests in
securing convictions for offenders' records are sufficient to preclude a
finding of mootness" because "[i]f the defendant has an interest in avoiding
the collateral consequences of a conviction, then the State has an equally
compelling interest in securing a conviction to effect those consequences");
State v. Dumars, 154 P.3d 1120, 1126-27 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007) (holding that the
State's appeal was not moot, even though defendant had fully served any
sentence which might be imposed after conviction and the relevant conviction
would not affect her criminal history score, because "[t]he same collateral
consequences that support a criminal defendant's interest in challenging a
conviction after the immediate consequences of the conviction no longer exist
also support the State's interest in preserving a criminal conviction. . . .
There is no principled reason collateral consequences presumed to have arisen
from a conviction will not support the State's interest in retrying the
defendant, just as such collateral consequences would be presumed if the
defendant sought to challenge her convictions. . . . [T]he State has an
interest in prosecuting a violation of the law and in redressing the victims
of that violation, including members of society at large.").

prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced
4[ ]
within six months :
. . . .
 (3) from the date of mistrial, order granting a new trial or
remand, in cases where such events require a new trial.
 
(Emphasis added). As this court has previously held: 
"'HRPP Rule 48(b) mandates the dismissal of criminal
charges if a trial on those charges does not commence within
six months, construed as one hundred eighty days, from the
time of arrest or of filing of charges, whichever is
sooner.'" Samonte, 83 Hawai' i at 514, 928 P.2d at 8
(quoting
 State v. Jackson, 81 Hawai' i 39, 50, 912 P.2d 71,
82 (1996)). "A violation of HRPP Rule 48 entitles
 [Defendant] to have the trial court dismiss the charges
against him 'with or without prejudice.'" State v. Dwyer,
 
78 Hawai' i 367, 371, 893 P.2d 795, 799 (1995) (quoting HRPP
Rule 48(b)).
 
Determining whether the HRPP Rule 48 period has run in
this case involves a two-step process: 
first, ascertaining
the date on which the clock started to run under HRPP Rule
 48(b)(1); and second, calculating any excludable periods
under HRPP Rule 48(c).
 
State v. Cenido, 89 Hawai 'i 331, 334, 973 P.2d 112, 115 (App. 
1999).
 
The State challenges the Circuit Court's COLs 2 and 3,
 
which state:
 
2.	 Out of the one-hundred ninety-two (192) days that
elapsed from the Intermediate Court of Appeals'
[Summary Disposition] Order Granting a New Trial to
the initial trial date of February 7, 2011, two (2)
days are excluded in computing the time for trial
commencement.
 
3.	 Accordingly, one-hundred ninety (190) days have
elapsed that are not excluded in computing the time
for trial commencement. This amount exceeds six
 months, and thus, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is
granted.
 
The State argues that the relevant date, the date on
 
which the Rule 48 clock started to run, was the ninety-first day
 
after the ICA filed its August 19, 2010 Judgment on Appeal, or
 November 18, 2010, because
 
the ICA's judgment cannot be effective and jurisdiction
cannot revert to the circuit court until the time for filing
application has expired or, if an application [for
certiorari] is filed, the supreme court has rejected or
 
4
 The six-month period has been "construed as one hundred eighty
days[.]" State v. Jackson, 81 Hawai' i 39, 50, 912 P.2d 71, 82 (1996).

dismissed the application or affirmed the [ICA's] judgment
in whole.
 
We agree. At the time of Char's prior appeal, Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 36(c) provided, in 
relevant part, that "[t]he intermediate court of appeals' 
judgment is effective upon the ninety-first day after entry. . . ."
5 Jurisdiction could not revert to the Circuit 
Court, and the case was not remanded, until the effective date of the ICA's Judgment. See State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai
'i 181, 197, 981 
P.2d 1127, 1143 (1999) (holding that the circuit court had no jurisdiction and could not schedule a retrial until after entry of the judgment on appeal; therefore, when less than six months elapsed between the entry of the judgment on appeal and the new trial, the defendant's HRPP Rule 48 right to a timely trial was not violated). Thus, in this case, the Circuit Court erred in failing to calculate the six months under HRPP Rule 48(b)(3) from the effective date of the ICA's Judgment, which led to an erroneous conclusion that more than six months elapsed before the commencement of Char's new trial. 
Accordingly, we need not reach the State's second point
 
of error.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Circuit
 
Court's September 24, 2012 Order, and remand this case for
 further proceedings.
