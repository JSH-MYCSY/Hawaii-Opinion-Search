Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR­
OVUII). 
On appeal, Kam contends that the District Court of the
 
2
First Circuit (District Court)  erred in permitting Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) to amend the charges against 
her to allege the required mens rea. Kam relies on a footnote in an unpublished summary disposition order of the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court, State v. Castro, No. SCWC-30703, 2012 WL 3089722, at *1 n.3 (Hawai
'i Jul. 30, 2012). The State concedes error based on 
the Castro footnote. For several reasons, including that the Castro footnote has been undermined by State v. Davis, 133 Hawai
'i 102, 324 P.3d 912 (2014), a more recent Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court published opinion, we conclude that the Castro footnote does not control our decision. We hold that the District Court did not err in permitting the State to amend the charges. We also hold that Kam's contention that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that she had previously been convicted of OVUII, proof that was necessary to support her conviction for OVUII as a repeat offender, is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm Kam's convictions. 
BACKGROUND

On January 11, 2012, at about 2:47 a.m., Honolulu
 
Police Department (HPD) Officer Mykle Moya (Officer Moya)
 observed the car Kam was driving "weaving heavily" on the H-1
 Freeway. Officer Moya followed Kam's car and observed it drift
 back and forth across lane markings and weaving within its lane. 
Officer Moya effected a traffic stop of Kam's car. Upon
 approaching Kam, Officer Moya noticed that Kam's eyes were red,

bloodshot, and glassy, that there was a very strong odor of
 
alcohol on her breath, and that her speech was slurred.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Officer Moya asked Kam for her driver's license and
 
vehicle documents. Kam stated that she did not have a license
 
and provided Officer Moya with vehicle documents. 
Kam participated in field sobriety tests conducted by
 
Officer Moya. Kam performed poorly. On the horizontal gaze
 nystagmus test, Officer Moya noted that in both eyes, Kam showed
 a lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at
 maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees,
 and that she also showed circular sway. On the walk and turn
 test, Officer Moya noted that Kam lost her balance five times
 during the instruction stage, and that during the walking stage,
 Kam stopped walking, missed heel-toe, stepped off line, and
 raised her arms multiple times. On the one leg stand test,
 Officer Moya observed that Kam swayed and raised her arms
 throughout the test, put her foot down once, counted the number 3
 twice, and skipped number 19.
 
Kam agreed to participate in a preliminary alcohol
 
screening test, which she "failed." Kam was placed under arrest
 and taken to the police station, where she agreed to take a
 breath test. The breath test administered by an Intoxilyzer
 operator showed that Kam had a breath alcohol concentration of
 0.173 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, which is above
 the legal limit.
 
A Case Detail Report for District Court "Case ID: 1DTA­
11-02742 -- State v. Cierra A M Kam" shows that on October 21,
 2011, "Cierra A M Kam" pleaded no contest to OVUII under Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) and that the
 plea was accepted by the District Court. The Case Detail Report
 further shows that sentence was imposed and that a "Judgment and
 Notice" was entered on October 21, 2012. A traffic abstract for
 "Kam, Cierra Ann M" shows that her driver's license was
 administratively revoked, pursuant to HRS Chapter 291E, part III,
 from July 17, 2011 to July 16, 2012.

OVLPSR-OVUII offenses on or about January 11, 2012. The
 
complaint, however, failed to allege the required mens rea of
 "intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly" with respect to the
 OVLPSR-OVUII offense or the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the
 OVUII offense. 
On April 12, 2012, after the State had filed its 
complaint against Kam, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court decided State v. 
Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). Kevin K. Nesmith 
(Nesmith) and Chris F. Yamamoto (Yamamoto) had each been charged with OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3). Id. at 50-51, 276 P.3d at 619-20.
6 In Nesmith, the supreme court 
held that the portion of Nesmith's OVUII charge and Yamamoto's OVUII charge that alleged a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) was defective because it failed to allege the required "intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly" mens rea. Id. at 54, 
56, 61, 276 P.3d at 623, 625, 630. The supreme court also held that an OVUII charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) "is an absolute liability offense for which mens rea need not be alleged or proven." Id. at 50, 276 P.3d at 619. On April 20, 2012, in light of Nesmith, the State filed
 
a motion to amend its complaint to allege the required
 
5(...continued)
(A) A term of imprisonment of not less than
three consecutive days but not more than
thirty days; 
(B)	 A fine of not less than $250 but not
 
more than $1,000; 
(C) Revocation of license and privilege to
operate a vehicle for an additional
year; and 
(D) Loss of the privilege to operate a
vehicle equipped with an ignition
interlock device, if applicable[.]

separate certiorari applications filed by Nesmith and Yamamotofor disposition. Nesmith, 127 Hawai

"intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly" mens rea for the
 
OVLPSR-OVUII offense and the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the
 OVUII offense. In its motion to amend, the State set forth the
 language of its proposed amended complaint and highlighted where
 it planned to insert the "intentionally, knowingly, or
 recklessly" mens rea. On June 29, 2012, Kam filed a memorandum
 in opposition to the State's motion. Kam did not contend that
 she would suffer any prejudice if the State were allowed to amend
 the complaint. Instead, she argued that the defect in the
 
charges for failing to allege the required mens rea was a
 
jurisdictional defect that required either dismissal of the
 complaint or limiting the State to proceeding on the HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) portion of the OVUII charge alone. 
On July 5, 2012, at a hearing held prior to trial, the
 
District Court granted the State's motion to amend the complaint,
 and it denied Kam's request to dismiss the complaint. The State
 served the Amended Complaint, which alleged that Kam had acted
 "intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly" in committing the
 charged OVLPSR-OVUII offense and in committing the HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) portion of the charged OVUII offense. Kam acknowledged
 receipt of the Amended Complaint and pleaded not guilty to the
 Amended Complaint.
 
The parties agreed to proceed with a trial on
 
stipulated evidence. The parties stipulated into evidence
 State's Exhibits 1 through 6, consisting of the following: 
Exhibit 1: Notice of Administrative Review Decision for
 
Respondent "Cierra Kam" regarding an arrest dated June 16, 2011,
 and Arrest Report No. 11-216656.
 
Exhibit 2: Copy of Hawai
'i State Identification Card 
for "Kam, Cierra Ann"; a vehicle Insurance Identification Card; and a Certificate of Motor Vehicle Registration. 
Exhibit 3: Notice of Administrative Revocation for
 
Respondent "Kam, Cierra A. M." for an arrest dated June 16, 2011,
 and Arrest Report No. 11-216-656.

The parties also stipulated "as to identification and
 
venue" and that "the driver's license and . . . date of birth of
 the documents" that were admitted in evidence matched before the
 information on the documents was "blacked out." Based on the
 stipulated evidence, the District Court found Kam guilty as
 charged of (1) OVLPSR-OVUII and (2) OVUII under both HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) and (a)(3), as a repeat offender under HRS § 291E­61(b)(2).
 
The District Court sentenced Kam on the repeat-offender
 
OVUII charge to five days in jail, a fine of $700, substance
 abuse assessment and treatment if necessary, revocation of her
 driver's license for eighteen months, and various surcharges and
 fees. It sentenced Kam on the OVLPSR-OVUII charge to five days
 in jail, a $500 fine, revocation of her driver's license for one
 year, and a surcharge and fees. The jail terms and license
 revocation periods were imposed to be served concurrently. The
 District Court entered its Judgment on September 28, 2012, and
 this appeal followed.
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.
 
The State charged Kam by complaint with OVUII as a 
repeat offender and with OVLPSR-OVUII. The State moved pre-trial to amend the complaint, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 7(f) (2011), to allege the required mens rea for the OVLPSR-OVUII charge and the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII charge. HRPP Rule 7(f)(1) provides: 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1) The court may permit a charge other than an
indictment to be amended at any time before trial commences
if substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.
 
The District Court, over Kam's objection, granted the State's
 
motion.
 
A.
 
Kam argues that the District Court erred in permitting 
the State to amend the complaint. In support of this argument, Kam relies on a footnote in the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's 
unpublished Castro summary disposition order (SDO). The footnote in Castro states: 
The State has proposed amending pending HRS § 291E–61(a)(1)
charges pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 
7(f)(1) post-Nesmith, but Nesmith makes it clear that theremedy for the deficient HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) charges isdismissal without prejudice. 
Castro, No. SCWC-30703, 2012 WL 3089722, at *1 n.3. 
For the following reasons, we conclude that the
 
footnote in the unpublished Castro SDO does not control our
 
decision in this case. 
First, Castro is an unpublished decision and therefore 
does not establish precedent. Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 35(c)(2) (2010) ("Memorandum opinions and unpublished dispositional orders are not precedent[.]"). 
Second, the footnote in Castro relies on Nesmith. 
However, in Nesmith, the OVUII charges against Nesmith and Yamamoto had not been amended, and the issue of whether the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of their charges (which was defective for failing to allege the requisite mens rea) could have been amended was not raised or directly addressed in Nesmith. Moreover, in Nesmith, the supreme court did not order the dismissal of the defective HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the charges. Instead, the court affirmed Nesmith's OVUII conviction and Yamamoto's OVUII conviction because they had each been charged with violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), and the supreme court found that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) portion of their charges was valid. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i at 61, 276 P.3d at 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
630. The Castro footnote does not specifically explain why
 
Nesmith would preclude the State from amending an HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) charge to allege the required mens rea.
 
Third, to the extent that the Castro footnote is based 
on a theory that a defect in a charge for failing to allege the requisite mens rea is jurisdictional in nature, see State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai
'i 139, 142-45, 63 P.3d 1109, 1112-15 (2003), 
that theory has been undermined by the supreme court's more recent published opinion in Davis, 133 Hawai
'i 102, 324 P.3d 912. 
Similar to Kam, Davis was charged with OVLPSR-OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2). Davis, 133 Hawai
'i at 104, 
324 P.3d at 914. Davis's charge was defective because it failed to allege the requisite mens rea. Id. at 110, 324 P.3d at 920. 
Instead of directing that the charge be dismissed without prejudice because the charge was defective, the supreme court held that it was required to address Davis's challenge to his conviction based on his express claim of insufficient evidence. Id. at 104, 120, 123; 324 P.3d at 914, 930, 933. 
The holding in Davis is inconsistent with the theory
 
that a defect in a charge for failing to allege the requisite
 mens rea is jurisdictional in nature. If the defect in Davis's
 charge was a substantive jurisdictional defect such that the
 trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to preside over
 Davis's case, then the supreme court could not evaluate Davis's
 sufficiency of the evidence claim. Justice Acoba, in his
 concurring opinion in Davis, confirmed this analysis by stating:
 "If an insufficient charge constituted a jurisdictional defect,
 then this court could not evaluate whether sufficient evidence
 existed before the trial court inasmuch as it would not have
 jurisdiction over the merits of the case." Id. at 123 n.2, 324
 
P.3d at 933 n.2 (Acoba, J., concurring). Based on Davis, we
 conclude that there is no jurisdictional impediment that served
 
11
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to prevent the District Court from permitting the State to amend
 
Kam's charges to allege the requisite mens rea.7
 
B.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we decline to follow the
 
footnote in the unpublished Castro SDO, and we instead conclude
 that the District Court was free to apply HRPP Rule 7(f)(1) in
 deciding the State's motion to amend the complaint against Kam.
8
 
Under HRPP Rule 7(f)(1), the District Court had the discretion to
 permit the State to amend the charges in the complaint before
 trial "if substantial rights of the defendant are not
 prejudiced." Here, Kam does not claim that her substantial
 rights were prejudiced by the State's amendment of the OVLPSR­OVUII charge and the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII
 charge before trial to allege the required mens rea.
 
7In Cummings, the supreme court concluded that the failure
of a charge to state an essential element of the offense was a
jurisdictional defect. Cummings, 101 Hawai 'i at 142-45, 63 P.3d
at 1112-15. The supreme court's analysis in Nesmith raised thequestion of whether non-element deficiencies in a charge, such asthe omission of the requisite mens rea, were viewed asjurisdictional. See Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i at 66, 276 P.3d at 635
(Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting) (reading the majorityopinion as concluding "that a state of mind is a 'fact' that mustbe included in an HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) charge for due processpurposes only, but not an element of HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) thatmust be included in a charge for purposes of jurisdiction."(brackets omitted)). Davis makes clear that a charge defective
for failing to allege the requisite mens rea, such as the chargesin Kam's original complaint, does not deprive the court ofjurisdiction over the merits of the case. Davis's articulation 
of its holding as requiring that express claims of insufficiencyof the evidence be addressed in cases where there is a "defective charge" or "charging error," see Davis, 133 Hawai
'i at 104, 120,
123; 324 P.3d at 914, 930, also indicates that the supreme courtmay no longer consider a charge defective for failing to allegean essential element to constitute a jurisdictional defect. 
8As noted, the State conceded error based on the Castro
footnote. However, the State filed its answering brief before
the supreme court's decision in Davis. Moreover, the State's
concession of error is not binding on an appellate court. State
 
v. Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000). 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
It has long been established law that in order to 
convict a defendant of OVLPSR-OVUII, the State was required to 
prove the defendant acted with an intentional, knowing, or reckless mens rea. See State v. Vliet, 95 Hawai
'i 94, 99, 19 
P.3d 42, 47 (2001) (holding that an intentional, knowing, or reckless mens rea applies to HRS § 291–4.5, the predecessor to HRS § 291E-62); State v. Lioen, 106 Hawai
'i 123, 130, 102 P.3d 
367, 374 (App. 2004); State v. Young, 107 Hawai 'i 36, 38, 109 
P.3d 677, 679 (2005) (holding that HRS § 291E-62 substantially reenacted HRS § 291-4.5). In addition, the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court's decision in Nesmith made clear that an "intentional, knowing, or reckless" mens rea was required to be charged and proved to establish OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Nesmith, 
127 Hawai
'i at 54, 56, 61, 276 P.3d at 623, 625, 630. 
Kam was represented by counsel during the District
 
Court proceedings. Citing Nesmith, the State filed its motion to
 amend the complaint to allege the required mens rea almost eleven
 weeks before trial. The State's motion set forth the proposed
 amended complaint and highlighted where it planned to insert the
 required mens rea. Thus, Kam had ample time to prepare any
 defense relevant to the amended mens rea aspect of the charges. 
Kam did not seek a continuance after the District Court granted
 the State's motion to amend. Instead, Kam advised the District
 Court that the parties had agreed to proceed with a trial on
 stipulated evidence. 
It would appear that HRPP Rule 7(f)(1) was promulgated
 
to address the precise situation presented by this case -- the
 correction of a charging error prior to trial, where the
 amendment to the charges does not prejudice the defendant's
 substantial rights. Where the State's pre-trial amendment of a
 charge in a complaint does not prejudice a defendant's
 substantial rights, there seems to be little justification for
 denying the amendment and good reasons for granting it. 
Permitting the amendment prevents delay, avoids inconvenience to
 the parties, and conserves judicial resources. In this case,
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
permitting the State to amend the charges served to prevent the
 
delay, inconvenience, and waste of judicial resources that would
 have resulted if the State had been required to seek dismissal of
 the charges and start the case over again by re-charging Kam. 
The State's amendment of the charges did not affect Kam's ability
 to prepare her defense and it did not prejudice her substantial
 rights. Other jurisdictions allow the prosecution to amend its
 charge where the defendant's substantial rights are not
 prejudiced. E.g., State v. Erickson, 852 So. 2d 289, 291 (Fla.
 
Dist. Ct. App. 2003); State v. O'Brien, 508 N.E.2d 144, 146-49
 (Ohio 1987); State v. Gosser, 656 P.2d 514, 518 (Wash. Ct. App.
 1982); State v. Schaffer, 845 P.2d 281, 283-85 (Wash. 1993);
 State v. Bluhm, 460 N.W.2d 22, 23-24 (Minn. 1990). We conclude
 that the District Court did not err in permitting the State to
 amend before trial the OVLPSR-OVUII charge and the HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII charge to allege the requisite mens
 rea.
 
II.
 
Kam contends that her conviction for OVUII as a repeat
 
offender must be vacated because the evidence adduced at trial
 was insufficient to show that she had been convicted of OVUII
 within five years of the OVUII offense charged in this case. In
 particular, Kam argues that there was insufficient evidence to
 show that she was previously convicted of OVUII because: (1) the
 State failed to introduce a judgment of conviction for the prior
 OVUII conviction; and (2) the State failed to show that Kam was
 the person convicted in the prior OVUII case. We disagree with
 Kam's arguments.
 In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view 
the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. State v. 
Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 576, 827 P.2d 648, 651 (1992). "The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Hoe, 122 Hawai
'i 347, 
349, 226 P.3d 517, 519 (App. 2010) (block quote format altered; 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
citation omitted). "Matters of credibility and the weight of the 
evidence and the inferences to be drawn are for the fact finder." State v. Romano, 114 Hawai
'i 1, 8, 155 P.3d 1102, 1109 (2007). 
"[A]ppellate courts will give due deference to the right of the trier of fact to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced." State v. 
Agard, 113 Hawai
'i 321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
A.
 
Kam argues that in order to prove a prior conviction,
 
the State was required to introduce a judgment that complied with
 the requirements of HRPP Rule 32(c)(2) (2012).
9 Kam's argument
 
is without merit.
 
Kam confuses the requirements for a judgment of
 
conviction with what is necessary to prove a prior conviction. 
HRS § 706-666(2) (1993) provides that a "[p]rior conviction may
 be proved by any evidence, including fingerprint records made in
 connection with arrest, conviction, or imprisonment, that
 reasonably satisfies the court that the defendant was convicted." 
In State v. Nishi, 9 Haw. App. 516, 525-27, 852 P.2d 476, 481-82
 (1993), we rejected the argument that a certified copy of the
 judgment was necessary to prove a prior conviction. Nishi argued
 that "the State was required to submit a 'certified copy of the
 
9HRPP Rule 32(c)(2) provides:
 
(c) Judgments.
 
. . . .
 
(2) IN THE DISTRICT COURT. A judgment of
conviction in the district court shall set forth
 
the disposition of the proceedings and the same
shall be entered on the record of the court. The
 filing of the written judgment, or in the event of
oral judgment, the filing of the written notice of
entry of judgment, in the office of the clerk
constitutes entry of judgment. The judgment or
notice of entry shall be signed by the judge or by
the clerk, if the judge so directs.

judgment,' rather than a certified copy of a traffic abstract" in
 
order to prove a prior conviction for driving without insurance. 
Nishi, 9 Haw. App. at 525, 852 P.2d at 481. In rejecting this
 argument, we held that a certified copy of the judgment was not
 the only way to prove a prior conviction, and we further held
 that "a certified copy of a person's traffic abstract is
 satisfactory evidence to establish his prior [traffic
 conviction]." Id. at 526-27, 852 P.2d at 481-82. In support of
 
our conclusion, we quoted HRS § 706-666(2). Id. at 526, 852 P.2d
 
at 481.
 
Here, the State introduced the "Case Detail Report" for
 
District Court "Case ID: 1DTA-11-02742 -- State v. Cierra A M
 Kam," certified by a District Court clerk, which shows that the
 District Court accepted the no contest plea of "Cierra A M Kam"
 to the charge of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), (a)(3), and
 (b)(1) on October 21, 2011; that the defendant was sentenced; and
 that a "Judgment and Notice" was filed in the District Court on
 October 21, 2011. The State also introduced a traffic abstract
 for "Kam, Cierra Ann M," certified by a District Court clerk,
 that also showed the same information reflected in the Case
 Detail Report regarding the entry of a no contest plea,
 sentencing, and entry of a "Judgment and Notice" for Case ID:
 1DTA-11-02742. We conclude that the State presented sufficient
 evidence to show that "Cierra A M Kam" was convicted of OVUII on
 October 21, 2011 in Case ID: 1DTA-11-02742. 
B.
 
We further conclude that the State introduced
 
sufficient evidence to show that the "Cierra A M Kam" with the
 prior OVUII conviction in Case ID: 1DTA-11-02742 was the same
 person charged with OVUII in this case. Kam stipulated "as to
 identification" in this case, which we take to mean that she
 admitted to being the person who was arrested and charged with
 
16

OVUII in this case.10 She also stipulated that "the driver's
 
license and . . . date of birth of the documents" that were
 
admitted in evidence matched before the information on the
 documents was "blacked out." 
The exhibits introduced by the State show that Kam (the
 
person charged in this case) is the same person with the prior
 October 21, 2011, OVUII conviction in Case ID: 1DTA-11-02742. 
The traffic abstract for "Kam, Cierra Ann M" not only identifies
 the subject of the traffic abstract by name, but also by a party
 ID and date of birth. The traffic abstract contains the Case ID
 for the charges against Kam underlying this case (Case ID: 1DTA­12-00359) and the prior OVUII conviction (Case ID: 1DTA-11­02742). 
In addition, there are numerous matches between the
 
police reports (Exhibit 6), which pertain to the charges against
 Kam in this case, and the Notice of Administrative Review
 Decision (Exhibit 1) and Notice of Administrative Revocation
 (Exhibit 3), which pertain to the OVUII arrest underlying the
 prior OVUII conviction. The police reports pertaining to the
 charges against Kam in this case identify the person arrested as
 "Kam Cierra, Ann" and show her residence address, date of birth,
 and the last four digits of her social security number. The
 Notice of Administrative Review Decision and Notice of
 Administrative Revocation identify the respondent as "Cierra Kam"
 and "Kam, Cierra A. M.," respectively, and both reflect the same
 
10In addition, the State introduced police reports relating
to the charges in this case, which identify the person arrested
as "Kam, Cierra, Ann" and include the arrestee's date of birth,sex, and physical description. It also introduced the Hawai
'i 
State Identification card for "Kam, Cierra Ann," which contains aphotograph and information regarding, date of birth, sex, andphysical description that matches (except for hair color) thephysical description in the police report. Kam was present incourt for trial, and the District Court was therefore able tocompare Kam's physical appearance with the photograph andinformation in the Hawai
'i State Identification card as well as 
the information in the police reports.

residence address, date of birth, and last four digits of the
 
social security number as shown in Kam's police reports (Exhibit
 6). Moreover, the police reports contain Kam's distinctive
 handwritten signature, and Exhibits 1 and 3 also contain the
 handwritten signature of the named "respondent." The signatures
 contained in all three exhibits are very similar in appearance. 
In sum, the State's evidence showed that a person with 
the same name, residence address, date of birth, and last four digits of the social security number as Kam, with a similar appearing signature as Kam, and whose prior traffic convictions were included in Kam's traffic abstract, was previously convicted of OVUII in Case 1DTA-11-02742. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to show that Kam was the person previously convicted of OVUII in Case 1DTA-11-02742. See Davis, 133 Hawai
'i 
at 122, 324 P.3d at 932 (concluding that evidence of matching name, date of birth, and last four digits of social security number was sufficient to show that the defendant was the previously convicted individual). 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District
 
Court's Judgment.
