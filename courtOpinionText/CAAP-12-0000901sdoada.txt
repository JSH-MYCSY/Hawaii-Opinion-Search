IUPAT contends the circuit court reversibly erred by
 
failing to conclude that Employer/Defendant-Appellee Endo
 
2
Painting Service, Incorporated's  (Endo Painting) statement that
 
it would produce circuit court-ordered documents after
 
disposition of Endo Painting's appeal and motion to stay pending
 
appeal, and its non-production of these documents constituted
 
civil contempt. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude IUPAT's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
IUPAT contends the circuit court reversibly erred by
 
denying IUPAT's August 8, 2012 post-judgment "Motion for Show
 
Cause Order and For Civil Contempt" because: (1) the finding of
 
"no significant" evidence of civil contempt contradicts IUPAT's
 
presentation of a prima facie case of civil contempt; (2) proof
 
of intent to violate the June 29, 2012 Order was not required to
 
conclude that Endo Painting's conduct rose to the level of civil
 
contempt; and (3) Endo Painting's filing of a motion for a stay
 
pending appeal and notice of appeal did not excuse its compliance
 
with the June 29, 2012 order.
 
IUPAT's contentions of circuit court error do not rise 
to a level evincing an abuse of discretion. See Wahba, LLC v. 
USRP (Don), LLC
, 106 Hawai 'i 466, 472, 106 P.3d 1109, 1115 
(2005). "An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a

Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(1) by omitting a subject matter index

noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28(b) may result in sanctions.

party litigant." Id. (internal quotation marks and citations
 
omitted).
 A prima facie showing of civil contempt is 
demonstrated "by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) a court 
order was in effect; (2) the order required certain conduct by 
the respondent; and (3) the respondent failed to comply with the 
court's order." LeMay v. Leander, 92 Hawai 'i 614, 625, 994 P.2d 
546, 557 (2000) (citations omitted). The June 29, 2012 Order was in effect; the order required Endo Painting to comply with 
certain provisions of the Agreement; and Endo Painting had not 
complied with the order as of the August 8, 2012 filing of 
IUPAT's civil contempt motion. Whether these facts constitute 
clear and convincing evidence of Endo Painting's civil contempt, 
however, was committed to the circuit court's discretion and the 
circuit court was not convinced that these facts clearly added up 
to a case of civil contempt. 
IUPAT contends a July 23, 2012 letter from Endo
 
Painting written in response to the accounting firm of Lemke,
 
Chinen, & Tanaka, C.P.A., Inc. (LCT), who had contacted Endo
 
Painting to arrange for their review of Endo Painting's payroll
 
accounts, foreperson's daily logs, and other supporting documents
 
evinces Endo Painting's failure to comply with the June 29, 2012
 
Order. In that letter, Endo Painting wrote: 
An appeal from the aforesaid order is being filed, a copy of
which should be delivered to [IUPAT's counsel] shortly. In
 addition, a motion to stay the order pending the appeal will
also be filed. Accordingly, Endo [Painting] will be in
contact with LCT after a final ruling on the motion for stay
has been entered.
 
Endo Painting stated that it suggested to LCT that Endo
 
Painting could provide documents in compliance with the circuit
 
court order after a decision on Endo Painting's appeal and motion
 
for stay pending appeal had been rendered, and Endo Painting

"never got any kind of objection to that proposal from [IUPAT] or
 
the accountants."
 
Endo Painting's statements may reasonably be 
interpreted to indicate Endo Painting's knowledge that it was or 
was not acting in compliance with the June 29, 2012 Order. While 
a knowing or intentional state of mind is immaterial when 
determining civil contempt violations due to its remedial 
purpose, facts showing that an alleged-contemnor lacked knowledge 
that he or she was violating an order may support a finding of a 
diligent attempt to comply with that order. See LeMay, 92 
Hawai'i at 626, 994 P.2d at 558 (holding that an allegedÂ­
contemnors' lack of knowledge that they were violating an 
injunction, and their good faith belief that they were not, 
supported a conclusion that alleged-contemnors had diligently 
attempted to comply with the injunction). 
IUPAT contends LeMay is inapplicable to the instant 
case because Endo Painting knew the scope of documents sought and 
that they had not produced the requested documents. IUPAT 
misreads the significance of LeMay to the instant case. Under 
LeMay, the circuit court could consider Endo Painting's knowledge 
of its (non)compliance with the June 29, 2012 Order in 
determining whether Endo Painting's actions were of a civil 
contempt character. See LeMay, 92 Hawai 'i at 621, 994 P.2d at 
553 ("[C]ivil contempt may be characterized as a court's desire to compel obedience to a court order[.]"). The circuit court 
concluded that it "does not see this [case] as rising to a civil 
contempt nature[.]" This conclusion, considering Endo Painting's 
representations that it intended to comply with the June 29, 2012 
Order, did not clearly exceed the bounds of reason so as to 
constitute a reversible abuse of discretion. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the September 26, 2012 "Order
