SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Fujise, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Derrick Y. Shigemura (Shigemura)
 
appeals from the Judgment entered on October 2, 2012, in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Shigemura
 
was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)

§ 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013).2 We affirm Shigemura's conviction
 
and sentence.
 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer Robert Steiner
 
observed Shigemura speeding and driving erratically. Officer
 
Steiner stopped Shigemura's vehicle and subsequently arrested
 Shigemura for OVUII. After Shigemura was transported to the
 police station, HPD Officer Kathleen Cruz read to Shigemura a
 form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle
 Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent Form). Shigemura
 agreed to take a breath test and refused a blood test. 
Shigemura's breath test showed that he had a breath alcohol
 concentration of .105 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of 
breath -- a concentration that exceeded the legal limit. 
Shigemura moved to suppress the results of his breath test, and
 the District Court denied his motion. 
On appeal, Shigemura challenges the District Court's
 
denial of his motion to suppress. Shigemura argues that: (1)
 because the police failed to give him Miranda warnings before
 reading the Implied Consent Form to him and obtaining his
 
2HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
 
person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 
. . .
 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]
 
Shigemura's complaint charged him with OVUII, in violation
of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2013) and/or (a)(3), and alleged that hewas subject to sentencing as a first offender in accordance withHRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2013). The District Court grantedShigemura's motion to dismiss the HRS§ 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the charge, and Plaintiff-AppelleeState of Hawai
'i only proceeded to trial on the alleged HRS §
291E-61(a)(3) violation.

decision on testing, the results of his breath test should have
 
been suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation; (2) the
 results of his breath test should have been suppressed because
 the police misinformed him of his statutory right to an attorney
 under HRS § 803-9 (1993); and (3) the results of his breath test
 should have been suppressed because the police misinformed him of
 the sanctions for refusing to submit to testing. 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, No. CAAP-12-0000858, --- Hawai
'i ---, --- P.3d ---, 2014 WL 
1270615 (Hawai 'i App. Mar. 28, 2014) (as amended on May 2, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Shigemura's motion to suppress, and we affirm Shigemura's conviction and sentence under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) and (b)(1).

3Although the District Court dismissed the HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII charge, see footnote 2, supra, the
typed portion of the District Court's Judgment under "Violation
Section" and its files erroneously indicate that Shigemura was
convicted of violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). We
 direct the District Court to file a corrected judgment that
clearly reflects that Shigemura was only convicted of violating
HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), as a first offender under HRS § 291E­61(b)(1).
