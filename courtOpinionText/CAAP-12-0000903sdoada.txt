1We note that the correct spelling of Defendant-Appellant's
first name is unclear. The trial court's judgment and the
parties' caption on appeal spell it as "Jersiah," while the
criminal complaint and certain exhibits in the record spell it as
"Jersiaha." We will use "Jersiaha" in referring to Defendant­Appellant's first name.

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013).3 We
 
affirm Tuisamatatele's conviction and sentence.
 
A police officer pulled Tuisamatatele over after
 
observing him engage in a reckless driving maneuver. The officer
 
subsequently arrested Tuisamatatele for OVUII. After
 Tuisamatatele was transported to the police station, the officer 
read to Tuisamatatele a form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While
 Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent
 Form). Tuisamatatele agreed to take a breath test and refused a
 blood test. Tuisamatatele's breath test showed that he had a
 breath alcohol concentration of .179 grams of alcohol per 210
 liters of breath -- a concentration that exceeded the legal
 limit. Tuisamatatele moved to suppress the results of his breath
 test, and the District Court denied his motion.
 
On appeal, Tuisamatatele challenges the District
 
Court's denial of his motion to suppress. Tuisamatatele argues
 that: (1) because the police failed to give him Miranda warnings
 before reading the Implied Consent Form to him and obtaining his
 decision on testing, the results of his breath test should have

(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
 
person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 
. . .
 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]
 
Tuisamatatele's complaint charged him with OVUII, in
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2013) and/or (a)(3), and alleged that hewas subject to sentencing as a first offender in accordance withHRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2013). The District Court grantedTuisamatatele's motion to dismiss the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the charge, and Plaintiff-AppelleeState of Hawai
'i only proceeded to trial on the alleged HRS §
291E-61(a)(3) violation.

been suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation; (2) the
 
results of his breath test should have been suppressed because
 the police misinformed him of his statutory right to an attorney
 under HRS § 803-9 (1993); and (3) the results of his breath test
 should have been suppressed because the police misinformed him of
 the sanctions for refusing to submit to testing. 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, No. CAAP-12-0000858, --- Hawai
'i ---, --- P.3d ---, 2014 WL 
1270615 (Hawai 'i App. Mar. 28, 2014) (as amended on May 2, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Tuisamatatele's motion to suppress, and we affirm Tuisamatatele's conviction and sentence under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) and (b)(1).

4Although the District Court dismissed the HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII charge, see footnote 2, supra, the
typed portion of the District Court's Judgment under "Violation
Section" and its files erroneously indicate that Tuisamatatele
was convicted of violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3).
We direct the District Court to file a corrected judgment that
clearly reflects that Tuisamatatele was only convicted of
violating HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(3), as a first offender under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1).
