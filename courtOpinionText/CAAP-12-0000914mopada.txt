APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0073-01)

MEMORANDUM OPINION

(By: 
Foley, Presiding J. and Fujise, J.,
with Reifurth, J. concurring separately)

Defendant-Appellant Karen M. Scott (Scott) appeals from

the "Order Denying Defendant Karen M. Scott's Motion To Dismiss

Complaint Filed January 10, 2012 Pursuant To HRS 634F-2, Filed

April 13, 2012" entered in the Circuit Court of the First 
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court) on October 15, 2012.  On January 10,
 
2012, Plaintiff-Appellee John D. Frye (Frye) filed his Complaint,

alleging claims against Scott for defamation and

intentional/negligent infliction of emotional distress, and

requesting punitive damages.

Scott contends the circuit court erred by failing to

dismiss Frye's complaint because it (1) was a strategic lawsuit

against public participation (SLAPP) under Hawaii Revised

Statutes (HRS) Chapter 634F; and (2) failed to state a claim upon

which relief could be granted under Hawaif i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6). 
Frye's complaint alleged, "on or about June 22, 2011

and at other times in June and July 2011, and thereafter SCOTT

made false and defamatory statements regarding FRYE, to Michael

Caylor, and other Honolulu Police Department employees, Pearl

Harbor, Hickam, and other United States employees, and others,

including the allegation that FRYE sexually assaulted and/or

raped and/or kidnapped Scott and or committed crimes against

SCOTT."

I.

"SLAPP" means a strategic lawsuit against public
participation and refers to a lawsuit that lacks
substantial justification or is interposed for delay
or harassment and that is solely based on the party's
public participation before a governmental body.

HRS § 634F-1 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).

Circuit courts treat a motion pursuant to HRS § 634F–2

(Supp. 2012) "as a motion for judgment on the pleadings." Perry

v. Perez-Wendt, 129 Hawaif i 95, 98, 294 P.3d 1081, 1084 (App. 
2013). "Appellate courts typically review a trial court's ruling 
on a motion for judgment on the pleadings under the right/wrong 
or de novo standard of review." Id. Pursuant to HRS § 634F-2(1) 
and (5), courts are limited to reviewing allegations contained in the pleadings and prohibit consideration of matters outside of 
the pleadings. Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 99, 294 P.3d at 1085. 
HRS § 634F–2 changes the typical burden of proof for a

motion for a judgment on the pleadings.
2 To prevail in a motion

2 In relevant part, HRS § 634F-2, "Required procedures; motion" reads:

Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, including
rules of court, upon the filing of any motion to dispose of
a claim in a judicial proceeding on the grounds that the
claim is based on, relates to, or involves public
participation and is a SLAPP lawsuit:

(1) The motion shall be treated as a motion for judgment on
the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings shall be
excluded by the court, and the court shall expedite the
hearing of the motion;

(2) The moving party shall have a right:
(A) To an immediate appeal from a court order denying
(continued...)

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for judgment on the pleadings under HRCP Rule 12(c), a movant 
must clearly establish that no material issue of fact remains and 
that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 100, 294 P.3d. at 1086. By contrast, 
"under the anti-SLAPP statute, when a motion to dispose of the claim(s) is filed, the burden of proof and persuasion rests with 
the responding party, i.e. the non-moving party." Id. (citing 
HRS § 634F–2(4)(B)). 
"The court shall grant the motion and dismiss the

judicial claim, unless the responding party has demonstrated that

more likely than not, the respondent's allegations do not

constitute a SLAPP lawsuit as defined in section 634F–1[.]" 
 
HRS § 634F-2(6).

II. 
 
Under HRS § 634F–1, a lawsuit is a SLAPP if it "lacks

substantial justification or is interposed for delay or

harassment and . . . is solely based on the party's public

participation before a governmental body." (Emphasis added.)

(B) 
To file an application for a writ of mandamus if the
court fails to rule on the motion in an expedited
fashion;

(3) Discovery shall be suspended, pending decision on
the motion and appeals;

(4) The responding party shall:
(A) Without leave of court, have seven days to amend its
pleadings to be pled with specificity, and shall
include such supporting particulars as are
peculiarly within the supporting pleader's
knowledge; and
(B) Have the burden of proof and persuasion on the
motion;

(5) The court shall make its determination based upon the
allegations contained in the pleadings;

(6) The court shall grant the motion and dismiss the
judicial claim, unless the responding party has
demonstrated that more likely than not, the respondent's
allegations do not constitute a SLAPP lawsuit as defined
in section 634F-1[.]

HRS § 634F-2.

HRS § 634F-1 defines "public participation" as "any oral or

written testimony submitted or provided to a governmental body

during the course of a governmental proceeding."

"Public participation" under HRS § 634F-1 must be 
"testimony submitted or provided during the course of 
governmental proceedings." Id. Chapter 634F does not define 
"testimony" nor "governmental proceeding" but this Court has employed the Black's Law Dictionary definitions of these 
statutory terms. Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 100, 294 P.3d at 1086; 
and see Singleton v. Liquor Comm'n, Cnty. of Hawaif i, 111 Hawaif i 
234, 243-44, 140 P.3d 1014, 1023-24 (2006) ("[W]here a term is 
not statutorily defined . . . we [the Hawaif i Supreme Court] may 
rely upon extrinsic aids to determine such intent. Legal and lay dictionaries are extrinsic aids which may be helpful in 
discerning the meaning of statutory terms."). 
"Testimony" is defined as "[e]vidence that a competent 
witness under oath or affirmation gives at trial or in an 
affidavit or deposition[;]" and "firsthand authentication of a 
fact: EVIDENCE, an outward sign, or a solemn declaration 
[usually] made orally by a witness under oath in response to 
interrogation by a lawyer or authorized public official[.]" 
Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 100, 294 P.3d at 1086 (citing Black's Law 
Dictionary 1613 (9th ed. 2009) and Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1214 (10th ed. 2000)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). In Perry, this Court also used definitions of 
proceeding as "any procedural means for seeking redress from a 
tribunal or agency, an act or step that is part of a larger 
action, or the business conducted by a court or other official 
body; a hearing[;]" and a "legal action, procedure, events, 
happenings, transaction, or an official record of things said or 
done[.]" Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 101, 294 P.3d at 1087 (citing 
Black's Law Dictionary 1324 (9th ed. 2009) and Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 927 (10th ed. 2000)) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). 
Considered within the context of HRS § 634F-1's focus

on "public participation," Scott's statements to police

authorities were not "testimony" nor were they provided "during

4

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the course of governmental proceedings." Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 
101, 294 P.3d at 1087. 
Construing the "public participation" term to emphasize

participation in public processes is consistent with the

legislature's intent in passing the SLAPP statute: prohibiting

the strategic use of a lawsuit to prevent or interfere with a

person's "exercise of their right to petition, including seeking

relief, influencing action, informing, communicating, and

otherwise participating with government bodies, officials,

employees, or the electorate[.]" H.B. 741, H.D. 1, S.D. 1, C.D.

1, 21st Leg., Reg. Sess. (2002), available at
 
http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2002/Bills/HB741_CD1_.htm.
 This construction of "public participation" is 
consistent with one of Chapter 634F's purposes: "[c]reat[ing] a 
more equitable balance between the rights of persons to file 
lawsuits and to trial by jury, and the rights of persons to 
petition, speak out, associate, and otherwise participate in 
their governments[.]" Perry, 129 Hawaif i at 98, 294 P.3d at 1084 
(citing 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 187, § 1 at 821-22). This balance guards against a potential chilling effect on the 
exercise of a person's rights to participate in governmental 
proceedings and the rights of persons to file lawsuits and to a 
trial by jury. Id. 
Because Frye's complaint demonstrated that more likely

than not his allegations do not constitute a SLAPP lawsuit as

defined in section 634F–1, the circuit court did not err in

denying Scott's motion to dismiss. HRS § 634F-2(6). 
 
Additionally, the circuit court did not err by failing 
to dismiss Frye's complaint because it did not "appear[] beyond 
doubt that [Frye] can prove no set of facts in support of 
his . . . claim that would entitle him . . . to relief" as is 
required under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6). Cnty. of Kauaf i ex rel. 
Nakazawa v. Baptiste, 115 Hawaif i 15, 24, 165 P.3d 916, 925 
(2007). Frye may be able to prove facts supporting his

Session (2002).

allegation that Scott's statements were defamatory and/or "made

with intent to cause or with reckless disregard of the

probability of causing . . . emotional distress."
