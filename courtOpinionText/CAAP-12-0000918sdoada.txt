OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DUANE K. PUA, SR., Claimant-Appellant, v.
PUNA CERTIFIED NURSERY, INC., Employer-Appellee,
and
 
FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY, Insurer-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2010-023 (H); (1-08-00888))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
On October 24, 2008, Claimant-Appellant Duane K. Pua,
 
Sr. ("Pua") filed a WC-5 Employee's Claim For Workers'
 
Compensation Benefits form with the Department of Labor and
 Industrial Relations ("DLIR"), seeking workers' compensation
 benefits relating to an injury described as "stress unable to
 face boss and function [at] work." He explained that the reason
 for filing the WC-5 form was "stress due to verbal threats by
 boss and recorded threats by boss," which, Pua alleged, occurred
 on October 23, 2008, at 6:55 p.m. when he "[c]ame home from
 work[, and] got message from wife to call boss. Lead to verbal
 threats on phone, also made to wife."
 
On January 4, 2010, the DLIR's Disability Compensation
 
Division issued its decision ("Decision") denying both Pua's
 claim for benefits and the request for credit and costs submitted
 by Pua's employer, Puna Certified Nursery, Inc. ("Employer"). 
On January 19, 2010, the DLIR acknowledged receipt of Pua's
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
January 15, 2010 letter appealing from the January 4, 2010
 
Decision. 
On May 5, 2010, the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board ("Board") issued its pretrial order, setting out
 the issues in the case, various deadlines including a medical
 reports submission deadline of January 12, 2011, and a trial date
 of March 9, 2011. By order dated March 14, 2011, at Pua's
 request, the trial date was continued to March 27, 2012. The
 order noted that "[a]ll issues, and other deadlines shall remain
 as previously identified in the Board's Pretrial Order of May 5,
 2010." 
On June 16, 2011, Employer filed a motion to strike
 
medical records that had been submitted after the medical reports
 submission deadline of January 12, 2011. Pua filed no opposition
 to the Employer's motion. On June 29, 2011, the Board granted
 Employer's motion. 
By letter received on March 23, 2012, Pua informed the
 
Board that he would not attend the March 27, 2012 trial because
 he did not have the form of identification necessary for him to
 fly to Oahu. Pua did not request a further continuation of the
 trial, noting that he had submitted all of his evidence. On
 October 5, 2012, the Board issued its Decision and Order,
 concluding that (1) Pua "did not sustain a personal psychiatric
 injury on October 23, 2008, arising out of and in the court of
 employment"; (2) Employer was entitled to a credit/reimbursement
 of $280.00 for travel expenses advanced to Pua; and (3) Pua was
 not liable to Employer for the costs of attending the Disability
 Compensation Division hearing on July 21, 2009. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 386-88 (Supp.
 
2013) and 91-14 (2012), Pua appeals to this court from the
 Decision and Order. On appeal, Pua appears to assert that the
 Board erred in concluding that he did not sustain a personal
 psychiatric injury on October 23, 2008, arising out of and in the
 course of his employment.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Decision and Order and resolve Pua's appeal as
 follows: 
In support of the Decision and Order, the Board issued
 
the following Findings of Fact: 
1. On October 23, 2008, [Pua] was employed as a truck
driver for Employer. [Pua] alleged that on that date he
sustained a work injury arising from a telephone
conversation with his boss. Employer denied liability for a
work injury.
 
. . . .
 
3. On November 28, 2008, [Pua] sought treatment with
Julia D. Crawford, M.D., a family practice physician. [Pua]
informed Dr. Crawford that on the date of the alleged
incident, the owner of Employer called him on his cell
phone, but he did not receive the phone call. When he
 arrived home, he learned his boss had spoken impolitely to
[Pua's] wife. When [Pua] called his boss, his boss yelled
at him, cursed and called him names.
 
[Pua] informed Dr. Crawford that he had trouble
sleeping, frequently thought about the event, and felt
depressed and anxious. Dr. Crawford's assessments were
 acute stress and adult adjustment disorder.
 
4. On A [sic] WC-2 Physician's First Report dated
May 14, 2009, Dr. Crawford stated that the October 23, 2008
was the only cause of [Pua's] condition, which she diagnosed
as "stress disorder, acute."
5. Joseph P. Rogers, Ph.D., a psychologist, examined
[Pua] at Employer's request. In his report dated June 29,
2009, Dr. Rogers described [Pua's] recollection of the
telephone call with his boss:
 
[Pua] then called [his boss] back, and [his
boss] reportedly asked: "Why didn't you return
my call?" [Pua] explained that [his boss] was
trying to give him a job assignment and was
yelling and searing [sic] at him saying: "You're
a f---ing a--hole! You're a f---ing pr---!
[Pua] asked [his boss] why he was searing [sic]
at him, and [his boss] reportedly replied: "F--­you! You f---ing pr---! F--- you! You f---ing
a--hole! [Pua] was shocked and commented "that
should have never happened."

the appeal. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt
, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d
553, 558 (1995). However, "inasmuch as 'this court has consistently adheredto the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heardon the merits, where possible,' we address the issues [that] the parties raise
on the merits." Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408,
420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001) (original brackets omitted) (quoting Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999)).

(Profane vulgarities modified by the Board.)
 
. . . [Pua] felt he needed to do something but did not
think [his boss] was going to harm him. According to Dr.
Rogers, [Pua] is a "very large, muscular man who knows
martial arts and played defensive end in professional
football. He acknowledges that he is much larger than [his
boss].)" [sic] [Pua] also stated that he was not ever afraid
of [his boss].
 
. . . [Pua] later followed up with Dr. Crawford. His
 
symptoms were that he could not sleep and "couldn't deal
with the fact that my boss did this to me." Dr. Crawford
 prescribed sleeping bills [sic], but has did not [sic] refer
[Pua] for psychiatric or psychological treatment.
 
. . . .
 
[Pua] also informed Dr. Rogers of childhood incidences
[sic] of physical and emotional abuse.
 
Dr. Rogers diagnosed an occupational problem and
opined that:
 
". . . there is no objective evidence that the
10/23/08 incident caused [Pua] to develop
symptoms of emotional distress that rose to a
level of a diagnosable mental disorder or
emotional disorder. Even though he reacted with
anger and dismay at the abusive swearing and
yelling by his supervisor, [Pua] never described
any symptoms consistent with an Anxiety Disorder
or Depressive Disorder. . . [Pua] certainly did
not develop an Acute Stress Disorder. . . ."
 
6. At the trial before the Board on March 27, 2012,
[Pua's boss] admitted utilizing profanities and foul
language in his conversation with [Pua]. . . .
 
. . . .
 
9. The Board credits the diagnosis and opinion of Dr.
Rogers over those of Dr. Crawford and finds that [Pua's]
symptoms did not rise to the level of a diagnosable mental,
emotional, psychiatric, or psychological disorder.
 
The Board issued the following Conclusions of Law, in relevant
 
part:
 
1. The Board concludes that [Pua] did not sustain a
personal psychiatric injury on October 23, 2008, arising out
of and in the course of employment.
 
. . . .
 
In this case, having credited the diagnosis and
opinion of Dr. Rogers over those of Dr. Crawford, the Board
has determined that [Pua] has failed to carry and meet the
initial burden of establishing the existence of a personal
mental injury.
 
In so concluding, however, the Board does not excuse
or condone the vulgar language utilized by [Pua's boss]. He
 was offensive, uncouth, rude, ignorant, and unprofessional.
His words were uncalled for, and may have, given a different
factual scenario, resulted in a compensable work injury.

Pua appears to argue that the Board erred in crediting
 
Dr. Rogers' opinion over that of Dr. Crawford and other health
 
care providers. We interpret this argument as comprising two
 issues: (1) whether the Board abused its discretion in striking
 the medical reports submitted after the medical report submission
 deadline; and (2) whether the Board clearly erred in crediting
 Dr. Rogers' diagnosis and opinion over those of Dr. Crawford. We
 address the issues in turn.
 
(1) Pua contends that he "has now provided additional
 
information to the Appelles [sic], that he previously provided to
 the [Board] in March 2011 Including [sic] medical Records [sic]
 that are attached here to as EXHIBIT "A"[.]" To the extent that
 Pua contends that the medical reports in "Exhibit A" should have
 been included and considered, we conclude that the Board did not
 abuse its discretion.
 
Hawaii Administrative Rules ("HAR") Rule § 12-47-41

 
provides:
 
The [B]oard shall not be bound by statutory and common
law rules relating to the admission or rejection of
evidence. The [B]oard may exercise its own discretion in
these matters, limited only by considerations of relevancy,
materiality, and repetition, by the rules of privilege
recognized by law, and with a view to securing a just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of the proceedings.
 
Haw. Admin. R. § 12-47-41. Therefore, "the [Board] has 'wide 
discretion in managing evidence,' and the [Board's] evidentiary rulings should be upheld, absent a showing of an abuse of discretion." Athens v. Int'l Archaeological Research Inst., 
Inc., No. 29495, 2011 WL 5997078, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2011) (SDO) (quoting Sugano v. State, Dep't of Atty. Gen., No. 29246, 2010 WL 231100, at *3 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2010) (SDO)) (original brackets omitted). "More generally, HAR § 12–47–1 provides that these rules 'shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every proceeding.'" Gabriel v. Cnty. of Hawai
'i, Dep't of Parks & Recreation, No. 
29789, 2013 WL 6008490, at *6 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2013) (mem. op.) (quoting Haw. Admin. R. § 12–47–1). 
HAR § 12-47-22(b)(3) provides that "[m]edical report
 
deadline means the date that all medical reports or records shall
 be filed at the [B]oard." Haw. Admin. R. § 12-47-22(b)(3). If
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Board sets a medical report submission deadline in a pre­
trial order and consistently maintains that deadline, it is not
 an abuse of discretion for the Board to disregard late-filed
 medical report submissions. See Haw. Admin. R. § 12–47–22(c)
 
("The pretrial order shall control the subsequent course of the
 appeal, unless modified by the board at the trial or prior
 thereto to prevent manifest injustice."); Tautua v. BCI Coca-Cola
 Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, No. 30291, 2012 WL 2308162, at *2
 (Haw. Ct. App. June 18, 2012) (SDO) (Board did not abuse
 discretion in excluding medical reports, when Board made order
 amending the initial pretrial order, clearly setting medical
 submission deadline for course of the appeal). Here, the Board
 set the medical report submission deadline at January 12, 2011,
 and maintained the deadline thereafter.
 
Furthermore, the untimely medical reports indicate that
 
they were prepared in 2009 and 2010, before the January 12, 2011
 deadline. Pua failed to provide a reasonable explanation for his
 failure to submit the medical reports until almost sixty days
 after the deadline, and well after they were prepared, nor does
 he argue that he was prevented from obtaining the documents in a
 timely manner. See Gabriel, No. 29789, 2013 WL 6008490, at *7
 
(holding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in excluding
 an untimely medical report when the claimant did not provide a
 reasonable explanation for her failure to obtain the report
 before the discovery deadline). Moreover, when Employer moved to
 strike the medical records, Pua did not submit a responsive
 memorandum.
 
Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, the
 
Board did not abuse its discretion in ordering that untimely
 medical reports be stricken from the record.
 
(2) Pua appears to also argue that the Board erred in
 
crediting Dr. Rogers' opinion over that of Dr. Crawford in making
 its determination, contending that the Findings of Fact and
 Conclusions of Law were "only based on Dr. Rogers['] opinion." 
The Board's evaluation of the weight and credibility of the
 evidence is not clearly erroneous.
 
It is well established that courts decline to consider the
 
weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
favor of the administrative findings, or to review the
agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of
witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings
of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field.
 
Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai 'i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002) 
(format altered) (quoting Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai 'i 
402, 409–410, 38 P.3d 570, 577–578 (2007)); see also Moi v. 
State, Dept. of Public Safety, 118 Hawai 'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 
753, 756 (App. 2008) ("[W]e give deference to the [Board's] assessment of the credibility of witnesses and the weight the [Board] gives to the evidence."). 
Therefore,
 The Board's Decision and Order, filed October 5, 2012,
 
is affirmed.
