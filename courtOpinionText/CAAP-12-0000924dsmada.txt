NO. CAAP-12-0000924
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
GLORIA RAQUEDAN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
BRIGIDO DAPROZA and AURELIO S. AGCAOILI, Defendants-Appellants.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-1587)
 
ORDER DENYING FEBRUARY 15, 2013 MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO FILE
REPLY BRIEF AND ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellant Gloria
 
Raquedan's (Appellant Raquedan) February 15, 2013 motion to
 
extend time to file a reply brief, (2) the lack of any opposition
 
by Defendants-Appellees Brigido Daproza (Appellee Daproza) and
 
Aurelio S. Agcaoili (Appellee Agcaoili) to Appellant Raquedan's
 
February 15, 2013 motion to extend time to file a reply brief,
 
and (3) the record on appeal, it appears that we do not have
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Appellant Raquedan has
 
asserted from the Honorable Edwin C. Nacino's August 27, 2012
 
"Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of
 
Judge[']s Order Denying Plaintiff's Non-Hearing Motion to Set
 
Aside Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Attorney Fees Dated
 
March 20, 2012" (hereafter "the August 27, 2012 order regarding
 
the award of attorneys' fees and costs"), because the circuit
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court has not yet entered a final judgment, as Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012) and Rule 58 of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) require for an appeal 
under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS ยง 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. 
Appeals under HRS ยง 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS ยง 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been 
entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant 
to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a 
judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record 
is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On November 1, 2012, the record on appeal was filed for 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000924, which does not contain a final judgment. Granted, the circuit court has entered 
an October 18, 2011 order granting Appellee Daproza and Appellee 
Agcaoili's motion for summary judgment. Nevertheless, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has consistently held that, "based on 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it 
resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been 
reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Although Appellant 
Raquedan purports to be appealing from the August 27, 2012 order 
regarding the award of attorneys' fees and costs, "such an order 
is not a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." 
Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 
(2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, "[a] circuit court's order awarding attorneys' fees 
and costs may not be certified as a final judgment, pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 54(b), because such an order is not a final decision 
with respect to a claim for relief." Id. (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). "The entry of judgment and taxation of costs are separate legal acts." CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., 
Inc., 95 Hawai' i 301, 307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) (citation, 
internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). "Absent entry of 
an appealable final judgment on the claims . . . [to which an 
award of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of 
attorneys' fees and costs is . . . not appealable." Fujimoto v. 
Au, 95 Hawai' i at 123, 19 P.3d at 706; CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond 
Co., Inc., 95 Hawai' i at 306, 22 P.3d at 102 ("Similarly, the 
September 23, 1999 Order [awarding only attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment [awarding only attorneys' fees] are not 
appealable, and we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review 
them."). Therefore, in the absence of a final judgment, the 
circuit court's August 27, 2012 order regarding the award of 
attorneys' fees and costs is not eligible for appellate review. 
Absent an appealable final judgment in this case, Appellant 
Raquedan's appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction over 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000924. Accordingly, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we deny Appellant Raquedan's
 
February 15, 2013 motion to extend time to file a reply brief,
 
and we dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000924 for
 
lack of jurisdiction.
