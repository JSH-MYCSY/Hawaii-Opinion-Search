STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KESLY LEWIS, Defendant-Appellant
(CR. NO. 11-1-1051)
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kesly Lewis (Lewis) appeals from
 
the October 2, 2012 Judgments entered in Cr. No. 11-1-0990 and
 
Cr. No. 11-1-1051 for two counts of Robbery in the Second Degree
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-841(1)(b)
 (Supp. 2012) and two counts of Robbery in the First Degree in
 violation of HRS § 708-840(1) (Supp. 2012) respectively. The
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)
1
 sentenced
Lewis to, inter alia, two terms of ten years incarceration for
 the counts in Cr. No. 11-1-0990, and two terms of twenty years
 for the counts in Cr. No. 11-1-1051, all terms to run
 concurrently.
 
On appeal, Lewis raises a single point of error,
 
maintaining that the Circuit Court "erred in concluding that

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Lewis] was not eligible to be sentenced as a Young Adult
 
Defendant pursuant to HRS § 706-667 [Supp. 2012)]."2 Lewis
 
argues that the Circuit Court erred because it (1) relied upon
 certain Family Court records in determining Lewis had been
 adjudicated for felony offenses and (2) ruled these adjudications
 disqualified Lewis from Young Adult Defendant (YAD) sentencing
 where Family Court jurisdiction had not been "waived with respect
 to the felony offenses."
 
After a careful review of the issues raised, the
 
arguments presented, the record and the applicable authority, we
 resolve Lewis's appeal as follows.
 
1. 
Lewis argues that the evidence presented that
 
disqualified him from being sentenced as a YAD was insufficient. 
He argues that the information contained in the Presentence
 Diagnosis and Report (PDR) and the records obtained from the
 
2
 §706-667 Young adult defendants.  (1) Defined. A young
adult defendant is a person convicted of a crime who, at the time
of the offense, is less than twenty-two years of age and who has
not been previously convicted of a felony as an adult or
adjudicated as a juvenile for an offense that would have
constituted a felony had the young adult defendant been an adult.
 
(2)
 Specialized correctional treatment. A young adult
defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment
exceeding thirty days may be committed by the court to the
custody of the department of public safety and shall
receive, as far as practicable, such special and
individualized correctional and rehabilitative treatment as
 may be appropriate to the young adult defendant's needs.
 
(3) Special term. A young adult defendant convicted of
a felony, in lieu of any other sentence of imprisonment
authorized by this chapter, may be sentenced to a special
indeterminate term of imprisonment if the court is of the
opinion that such special term is adequate for the young
adult defendant's correction and rehabilitation and will not
 jeopardize the protection of the public. When ordering a
special indeterminate term of imprisonment, the court shall
impose the maximum length of imprisonment, which shall be
eight years for a class A felony, five years for a class B
felony, and four years for a class C felony. The minimum
length of imprisonment shall be set by the Hawaii paroling
authority in accordance with section 706-669. During this
special indeterminate term, the young adult shall be
incarcerated separately from career criminals, when
practicable.
 
This section shall not apply to the offenses of murder
or attempted murder.

Family Court regarding his adjudications in the Family Court,
 
could not sufficiently prove the disqualifying adjudications. 
Without citation to any applicable authority, Lewis argues that
 the sentencing procedures imposed in the enhanced sentencing
 context should apply here.
 
We reject Lewis's argument. He was sentenced in these 
cases to ordinary terms of imprisonment under HRS §§ 706-659 (Supp. 2011) (Sentence of imprisonment for class A felony) and 706-660 (1993) (Sentence of imprisonment for class B and C felonies; ordinary terms), to which no special procedures apply. In ordinary sentencing, the rules of evidence do not apply. Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 1101(d)(3); State v. Loa, 83 Hawai'i 335, 355, 926 P.2d 1258, 1278 (1996). More importantly, 
the Circuit Court was specifically authorized to consider Lewis's juvenile record in deciding whether he was entitled to YAD sentencing. State v. Nobriga, 56 Haw. 75, 83, 527 P.2d 1269, 
1274 (1974) (holding that HRS § 706-602 (Supp. 1973) authorized the use of juvenile record in the presentence report for purposes of sentencing). 
Moreover, Lewis asked the Circuit Court to sentence him
 
as a YAD. The burden was on him to come forward with evidence of
 some kind showing that he did not have a disqualifying
 adjudication or conviction on his record. See United States v.
 
Hagan, 412 F.3d 887, 893 (8th Cir. 2005) (defendant has burden of
 proof to show eligibility for downward departure); See also
 United States v. Butler, 970 F.2d 1017, 1026 (2nd Cir. 1992) ("If
 the defendant seeks decreased punishment, he or she has the
 burden of showing that the circumstances warrant that
 decrease."). Not only did he fail to do so, he did not have any
 "additions or corrections" to the PDR when asked by the Circuit
 Court. His "objection" was to the inclusion of information in
 the PDR containing his adjudications in Family Court. This
 information has long been authorized by statutory and case law. 
Nobriga, 56 Haw. at 81, 527 P.2d at 1273 ("[W]e hold that HRS
 § 706-602 (Supp. 1973) authorized the use of appellant's juvenile
 court record in the presentence report made mandatory in this
 case[.]")

The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
considering information in the PDR or the Family Court records
 
and, based upon these records, determining that Lewis did not
 qualify for YAD sentencing.
 
2. Relying on State v. Sylva, 61 Haw. 385, 389, 605
 
P.2d 496, 499 (1980), a case construing HRS § 853-4 governing
 deferred acceptance of guilty or nolo contendere pleas, Lewis
 argues on appeal that, even if the Circuit Court could properly
 consider his juvenile records, those adjudications did not
 disqualify him from YAD sentencing because the Family Court did
 not waive jurisdiction over him and he was not tried as an adult
 for those offenses. Lewis's reliance on Sylva is misplaced and
 the Circuit Court did not plainly err in applying the YAD statute
 to him.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has reviewed the YAD statute, 
found its language unambiguous, and specifically declined to apply its Sylva analysis to the YAD statute. State v. Daugherty, 
71 Haw. 609, 610, 801 P.2d 553, 555 (1990). While the court did not discuss whether such a construction would yield an absurd result, we conclude that the scenarios posited by Lewis are unsupported and unpersuasive. 
Therefore, the October 2, 2012 Judgments of the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit entered in Cr. No. 11-1-0990 and Cr.
 No. 11-1-1051 are affirmed.
