IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TESSA LYNN MURPHY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-12-01350)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Appellant Tessa Lynn Murphy (Murphy) appeals from the
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence for Operating a Vehicle Under
 
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii
 
1
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013)  entered by
the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division
 
(District Court) on October 11, 2012.2
 
On appeal, Murphy argues that the District Court erred
 
by denying her motion to suppress the results of her breath test 
1
 HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
. . . .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]

(1) when the police erroneously informed her that she "shall" be 
subject to thirty days in jail for refusing; (2) because she was 
asked while in custody whether she wanted to incriminate herself 
in the petty misdemeanor offense of OVUII without being informed 
of her Miranda rights; and (3) where the police violated HRS 
ยง 803-9 (1993) ("Examination after arrest; rights of arrested 
person") in securing the breath test. In her reply brief, Murphy 
also relies on Missouri v. McNeely, --- U.S. ---, 133 S. Ct. 
1552, 185 L. Ed. 2d 696 (2013), decided after the filing of her 
opening brief, for the proposition that under the Fourth 
Amendment of the United States Constitution and article 1 
section 4 of the Hawai 'i State Constitution, evidence of consent 
was necessary to admit the breath test results. 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, --- Hawai 'i ---, --- P.3d ---, CAAP-12-0000858, 2014 WL 
1270615 (App. Mar. 28, 2014, amended May 2, 2014). Based on Won, 
we conclude that the District Court properly denied Murphy's 
motion to suppress. 
Therefore, we affirm the October 11, 2012 judgment
 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 
Division.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 30, 2014.
