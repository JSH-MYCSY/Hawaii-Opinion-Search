IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TIRA H. AKINA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-12-02407)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Tira H. Akina appeals from the
 
Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, filed on October 4, 
2012, in the District Court of the First Circuit ("District
 
1
Court"),  in which the District Court dismissed without prejudice
the charge of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an

 
Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 291E­61(a)(1) and/or (3) (Supp. 2014).
 
On appeal, Akina argues that the District Court erred

 
by (1) failing to provide specific findings of fact and
 conclusions of law to support dismissal of the charge without
 prejudice and (2) dismissing the charge without prejudice instead
 of with prejudice.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Akina's points of error as follows and affirm:

Before we can reach the issue of whether the District
 
Court erred in failing to provide written findings and
 
2
conclusions,  we are confronted with the fact that the Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure place on the appellant the

 
affirmative burden of providing the transcript of the
 
proceedings:
 
When an appellant desires to raise any point on appeal that
requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the
court appealed from, the appellant shall file with the
appellate clerk, within 10 days after filing the notice of
appeal, a request or requests to prepare a reporter's
transcript of such parts of the proceedings as the appellant
deems necessary that are not already on file.
 
Haw. R. App. P. 10(b)(1)(A). See State v. Resich, No. CAAP-12­
0000649, 2015 WL 405593 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2015); State v. 
Kobayashi, No. CAAP-12-0000650, 2015 WL 539789 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2015). It is well settled that "'[t]he burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.'" Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (brackets omitted) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984)). 
Because Akina's claim that the District Court erred in 
denying her motion to dismiss without prejudice depends on a review of the court's oral decision, the factual basis for her alleged point of error is not part of the record. Appellate courts "will not presume error from a silent record." State v. 
Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000). 
2/
 [I]n determining whether to dismiss a charge with or
without prejudice under [Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure] Rule 48(b), the trial court must not only
consider the [factors set out in State v. Estencion,
63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981)], but must also
clearly articulate the effect of the Estencion factors 
and any other factor it considered in rendering itsdecision. 
State v. Hern, 133 Hawai' i 59, 64, 323 P.3d 1241, 1246 (App. 2013). "The 
trial court's explanation of its consideration of the Estencion factors and 
the basis for its decision will permit meaningful appellate review." Id. at 
65, 323 P.3d at 1247.
