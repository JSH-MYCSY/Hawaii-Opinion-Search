 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
disqualify the Dubin Law Offices as counsel for the Alao 
Appellants (hereinafter "the October 5, 2012 interlocutory 
disqualification order"), because the circuit court has not yet 
entered an appealable final judgment in this case, as 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012) and 
Rule 58 of the Hawaif i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) require 
for an appeal under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaif i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawaif i 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered 
in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to 
HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawaifi at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all 
claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a 
separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawaif i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the 
time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." 
Jenkins, 76 Hawaif i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The October 5, 2012 interlocutory disqualification
 
order is not a final judgment, but instead, it is an
 
interlocutory order disqualifying the Dubin Law Offices from
 
representing the Alao Appellants in this case. The October 5,
 
2012 interlocutory disqualification order is not certified for
 
interlocutory appellate review pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). On

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
December 19, 2012, the circuit court clerk filed the record on
 
appeal for CAAP-12-0000982, at which time the record on appeal
 
did not contain an appealable final judgment. Therefore, the
 
October 5, 2012 interlocutory disqualification order is not
 
appealable unless it qualifies under one of the few exceptions to
 
the requirement for final judgment.
 
As the Supreme Court of Hawai
fi has explained, an order 
granting or denying a motion to disqualify a party’s counsel
 
d[oes] not determine the merits of the case, and it can be
final for the purpose of appeal only if it comes within the
collateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp.,
337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225, 93 L.Ed. 1528
(1949), embracing "that small class which finally determine
claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights
asserted in the action, too important to be denied review
and too independent of the cause itself to require that
appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is
adjudicated."
 
Gomes v. Kauwe’s Heirs, 52 Haw. 126, 127, 472 P.2d 119, 120 
(1970) (emphasis added) (holding than an order denying a motion 
to disqualify counsel is not appealable as a matter of right); 
Chuck v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 61 Haw. 552, 556-57, 
606 P.2d 1320, 1323-24 (1980) (holding that an order granting a 
motion to disqualify counsel is not appealable as a matter of 
right). "In order to fall within the narrow ambit of the 
collateral order doctrine, the order must [1] conclusively 
determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue 
completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be 
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." 
Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawaif i 157, 161, 883 P.2d 78, 82 (1994) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted; original brackets). 
The Supreme Court of Hawaif i has held that the 
collateral order doctrine does not apply to an order denying a 
motion to disqualify counsel: 
In this case, we do not think that appellants will
suffer immediate and irreparable injury by a denial of their
appeal. If the circuit court erred, that question may be

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
raised on appeal from judgment on the merits. . . . . To
 
allow appeals from all orders denying disqualification of
attorneys will invite delay by piecemeal appeals .
 
Gomes v. Kauwe’s Heirs, 52 Haw. at 127, 472 P.2d at 120
 
(citations omitted); see also Wong v. Fong, 60 Haw. 601, 604, 593
 
P.2d 386, 389 (1979). Likewise, the Supreme Court of Hawaif i has 
also specifically held that the collateral order doctrine does
 not apply to an order granting a motion to disqualify counsel,
 
because, among other things, the aggrieved party may either (1)
 
seek permission from the circuit court for an interlocutory
 
appeal by way of HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2012) so that the
 
circuit court can decide whether to incur the added expense and
 
disruptive delay of an interlocutory appeal or (2) petition the
 
Supreme Court of Hawaif i for a writ of mandamus. Chuck, 61 Haw. 
at 556-57, 606 P.2d at 1323-24.
 
We have already held, however, that orders denying
disqualification are interlocutory and hence not appealable
as of right under the rule, Gomes v. Heirs of Kauwe , 52 Haw.
126, 472 P.2d 119 (1970), and while a distinction could be
drawn between an order denying and an order granting
disqualification, we are not of the view that appeal from
the latter order should be accorded as a matter of right.
The Cohen rule was intended by the Supreme Court to apply
only to those cases which were too important to be denied
review through the appellate process, and we are reluctant,
at least insofar as it concerns attorney disqualifications,
to expand the doctrine much beyond that which necessitated
its formulation in the first instance.
 
We recognize, of course, the importance of a party's
right to be represented by his chosen counsel, and we are
not unmindful of the inconvenience that may be visited upon
him by reason of his counsel's disqualification. But the
 party whose counsel is disqualified is not without some
means of judicial review. He may move the trial court for
permission to take an interlocutory appeal. HRS s 641-1. 
And while the motion would be addressed to the sound
 discretion of the trial court, the process does enable the
trial court to perform the important and necessary function
of isolating cases meriting appellate review from those that
would result in unnecessary expense and delay. Automatic
 appeal, as of right, in every case of counsel
disqualification would preclude the utilization of this
salutary procedural screening device.
 
The trial court, being intimately familiar with the
nature and course of the litigation, is in the best possible
position to determine whether special circumstances exist to
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
warrant interlocutory appellate review of the attorney's
disqualification. Failing in his efforts to obtain
interlocutory review, the party affected by the
disqualification may still petition this court for a writ of
mandamus to direct the trial court to set aside its order of
 disqualification. Cf. Wong v. Fong, 60 Haw. 601, 593 P.2d
386 (1979).
 
Id. at 556-57, 606 P.2d at 1323-24 (footnotes omitted); see also 
Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawaif i 410, 414, 917 P.2d 
1284, 1288 (1996) ("This court has determined that a petition for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is an appropriate vehicle 
for reviewing an order of disqualification." (Citation 
omitted)). Under the holding in Chuck, the collateral order 
doctrine does not apply to the October 5, 2012 interlocutory 
disqualification order. 
The Alao Appellants additionally appear to assert that
 
the October 5, 2012 interlocutory disqualification order is
 
somehow appealable under the Forgay doctrine that was based on
 
the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Forgay v. Conrad, 47
 
U.S. 201 (1848), and adopted by the Supreme Court of Hawaif i in 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawaif i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). 
Under the Forgay doctrine, an appellate court "ha[s] jurisdiction 
to consider appeals from judgments which [1] require immediate 
execution of a command that property be delivered to the 
appellant's adversary, and [2] the losing party would be 
subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait 
the final outcome of the litigation." Id. (citations, internal 
quotation marks omitted, some brackets omitted, some brackets added). However, the Forgay doctrine clearly does not apply to 
the October 5, 2012 interlocutory disqualification order, because 
the October 5, 2012 interlocutory disqualification order does not 
require the immediate execution of a command that property be 
delivered to the Alao Appellants' adversary. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction to review the October 5, 2012 interlocutory
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disqualification order, and the Alao Appellants' appeal is
 
premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees' January 24, 2013
 
Motion To Dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12-0000982 for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court
 
case number CAAP-12-0000982 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
