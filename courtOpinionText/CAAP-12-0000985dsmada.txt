(1)
 DENYING MARCH 13, 2013 MOTION FOR
EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE OPENING BRIEF AND
 
(2) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellant Indymac Venture,
 
LLC's (Appellant Indymac Venture), March 13, 2013 motion for an
 
extension of time to file its opening brief, (2) the lack of any
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
other party's response to Appellant Indymac Venture's March 13, 
2013 motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over Appellant Indymac Venture's appeal from the Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano's September 17, 2012 order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property for $1,005,000.00. 
This appeal arises out of Appellant Indymac Venture's
 
complaint for foreclosure, in which Appellant Indymac Venture
 alleged an outstanding balance due on a promissory note in the
 amount of $4,390,261.10, and Appellant Indymac Venture prayed
 for, among other remedies, a deficiency judgment. When a party
 desires to assert an appeal from a foreclosure case such as this,
 the two primary statutes that potentially authorize appellate
 review of an order confirming the sale of foreclosed property are
 (1) Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51 (Supp. 2012) and
 (2) HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012).
 
HRS § 667-51(a)(2) authorizes a party in a foreclosure 
action to assert an appeal from a judgment on an order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property that contains the necessary finding for certification pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP): 
§ 667-51 Appeals. (a) Without limiting the
class of orders not specified in section 641-1
from which appeals may also be taken, the
following orders entered in a foreclosure case
shall be final and appealable:
 
(1) A judgment entered on a decree of
foreclosure, and if the judgment incorporates
an order of sale or an adjudication of a
movant's right to a deficiency judgment, or
both, then the order of sale or the
adjudication of liability for the deficiency
judgment also shall be deemed final and
appealable;
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) A judgment entered on an order confirming the
sale of the foreclosed property, if the
circuit court expressly finds that no just
reason for delay exists, and certifies the
judgment as final pursuant to Rule 54(b) of
the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure; and
 
(3) A deficiency judgment; provided that no
appeal from a deficiency judgment shall raise
issues relating to the judgment debtor’s
liability for the deficiency judgment (as
opposed to the amount of the deficiency
judgment), nor shall the appeal affect the
finality of the transfer of title to the
foreclosed property pursuant to the order
confirming sale.
 
(b) An appeal shall be taken in the manner
and within the time provided by the rules of
court.
 
HRS § 667-51 (emphases added). However, HRS § 667-51(a)(2) does
 
not authorize a party in a foreclosure action to assert an appeal
 from an "order" confirming the sale of foreclosed property. An
 order and a judgment are two different things under HRS § 667-51. 
The circuit court has not entered an HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified
 judgment on the order confirming the sale of the foreclosed
 property. Therefore, absent the entry of such a judgment, HRS
 § 667-51(a)(2) does not authorize appellate review of the
 September 17, 2012 order confirming the sale of the foreclosed
 property.
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from "final
 
judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" (Emphasis added). Appeals
 under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by
 the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that
 "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." 
Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only 
after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment 
has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). When 
explaining the applicability of HRS § 641-1(a) to foreclosure cases, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i "has previously noted that 
foreclosure cases are bifurcated into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of foreclosure and the order of sale, if the order of sale is incorporated within the decree; and (2) all other orders." Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai' i 159, 
165, 45 P.3d 359, 365 (2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Although the language in HRS § 641-1(a) generally requires the "final" resolution of all claims against all parties for appealability, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that a foreclosure decree is appealable under 
HRS § 641-1(a) based on the collateral order doctrine. 
The rational for permitting (and requiring) an appeal of a
foreclosure decree and its accompanying orders, even though
there may be additional proceedings remaining in the circuit
court, is that a foreclosure decree falls within that small
class of orders which finally determine claims of right
separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the
action, too important to be denied review and too
independent of the cause itself to require that appellate
consideration be deferred until the whole case is
 adjudicated.
 
Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai' i at 165, 45 P.3d at 
365 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In 
contrast to an appeal from a foreclosure decree, however, an appeal from "matters subsequent to the foreclosure decree, such as the confirmation of sale . . . would have to wait until entry of the circuit court’s final order in the case." Id. (citation 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted; emphases added). "In foreclosure cases which result in 
a deficiency, the last and final order . . . is usually the deficiency judgment." Security Pacific Mortgage Corporation v. 
Miller, 71 Haw. 65, 70, 783 P.2d 855, 858 (1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphases added); Hoge v. Kane, 4 Haw. App. 246, 247, 663 P.2d 645, 647 (1983) ("In foreclosure cases, which result in a deficiency, the last and final order . . . is usually the deficiency judgment."). The circuit court has not yet entered a deficiency judgment or a final judgment in this case. 
Considering that
 (a) Appellant Indymac Venture's complaint for
foreclosure alleged an outstanding balance due in
the amount of $4,390,261.10 and prayed for, among
other remedies, a deficiency judgment, and
 
(b) the September 17, 2012 order confirms the sale of
the foreclosed property for a price of
$1,005,000.00,
 
it appears that the September 17, 2012 order confirming the sale
 
of the foreclosed property is not the last and final order in
 this foreclosure case. Consequently, the September 17, 2012
 order confirming the sale of the foreclosed property is not an
 appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a), Appellant Indymac
 Venture's appeal from the September 17, 2012 order confirming the
 sale of the foreclosed property is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction. See, e.g., Professional Sponsoring Fund,
 
Inc. v. Rao, 5 Haw. App. 382, 384, 694 P.2d 885, 887 (1985)
 ("Consequently the . . . order confirming the commissioner's sale
 is an interlocutory order that may not be appealed absent special
 permission until the second part of the case is completed.").
 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

P.2d 576, 588 (1995) (citation, internal quotation marks, and
 ellipsis points omitted; emphasis added). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Indymac Venture's
 
March 13, 2013 motion for an extension of time to file its
 opening brief is denied.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case
 
number CAAP-12-0000985 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
