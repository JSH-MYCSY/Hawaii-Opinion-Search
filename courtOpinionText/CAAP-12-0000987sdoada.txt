IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ZACHARY FAAMAMA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1P112-0002161)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Zachary Faamama ("Faamama") appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order ("Judgment")
 
1
entered on October 12, 2012  by the District Court of the First
2
Circuit, Honolulu Division ("District Court"),  finding Faamama
guilty of the offense of Assault in the Third Degree, Hawaii

 
Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 707-712(1)(a).3

 It appears that the file-stamp on the Judgment reflects a clerical
error in that the incorrect month, September, was stamped instead of October.
Additionally, although the bar code affixed to the Judgment reflects the
correct date of filing, October 12, 2012, it may not reflect the correct time.
Since the parties have not objected, and the facts of the matter do not appear
to be in dispute, we understand the Judgment to have been properly entered on
October 12, 2012.

 The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.

 HRS § 707-712 provides that
 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the
third degree if the person:
 
(a)	 Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person; or
 
(b)	 Negligently causes bodily injury to another
person with a dangerous instrument.

On appeal, Faamama contends that he was deprived of his
 
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel "where
 
[defense counsel's] errors and omissions during the trial
 substantially impaired [his] defense of reasonable doubt" 
because (1) defense counsel should have filed pre-trial motions,
 (2) counsel's objections during trial were erroneous, (3)
 counsel's cross-examinations did not assist Faamama's defense and
 may have hindered his case, and (4) counsel did not adequately
 conduct pretrial investigation. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Faamama's points as follows:
 
We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel 
on appeal to determine whether, "viewed as a whole, the assistance provided was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases." Dan v. State, 76 Hawai
'i 423, 
427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980)) (internal
 quotation marks omitted).
 
General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient and every
action or omission is not subject to inquiry. Specific
actions or omissions alleged to be error but which had an
obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendant's case
 
will not be subject to further scrutiny. If, however, the
action or omission had no obvious basis for benefitting the
defendant's case and it "resulted in the withdrawal or
 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense," then it will be evaluated as information that an
ordinary competent criminal attorney should have had.
 
Id. (ellipses and brackets omitted) (quoting Briones v. State, 74 
Haw. 442, 462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)). "[M]atters presumably within the judgment of counsel, like trial strategy, will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." State v. 
Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 39-40, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247-48 (1998) 
(quoting State v. Smith, 68 Haw. 304, 311, 712 P.2d 496, 501 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
(2) Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor
unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by
mutual consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 707-712 (1993).

To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a 
defendant is required to prove not only that there were "specific 
errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence[,]" but also that "such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potential meritorious defense." State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai
'i 504, 516, 
78 P.3d 317, 329 (2003) (quoting State v. Aplaca, 74 Haw. 54, 66­67, 837 P.2d 1298, 1305 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Faamama points to counsel's failure to file pretrial
 
motions, "perfunctory" cross-examinations, and alleged lack of
 pretrial investigation as errors or omissions supporting his
 ineffective assistance of counsel claim. However, these general
 allegations, without identifying the basis for the motions, which
 questions, or in what specific respect counsel failed to
 investigate, are insufficient. Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442,
 
462, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993) ("General claims of ineffectiveness
 are insufficient and every action or omission is not subject to
 inquiry.").
 
Additionally, Faamama states that defense counsel's
 
"errors and omissions during the trial substantially impaired
 Faamama's defense of reasonable doubt." He does not, however,
 articulate any possible defense that was either withdrawn or
 substantially impaired by counsel's conduct. 
"Reasonable doubt", in and of itself, is not a 
"defense". Faamama may mean that defense counsel's errors and omissions impaired Faamama's ability to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the fact-finder as to one or more of the elements of Assault in the Third Degree. He does not, however, suggest any possible basis upon which doubt could have been raised as to any of the elements of the offense. Although "no showing of 'actual' prejudice is required to prove ineffective assistance of counsel[,]" Richie, 88 Hawai
'i at 39, 960 P.2d at 1247, there 
must be at least some suggestion that the result may have been different had defense counsel been effective at trial in order for a defendant to meet his or her burden. See Wakisaka, 102 
Hawai
'i at 516, 78 P.3d at 329.

On this basis, therefore, Faamama's ineffective
 
assistance claim is without merit. 
"The burden to show ineffective assistance of trial or
 
appellate counsel rests with the petitioner." Briones, 74 Haw.
 
at 460, 848 P.2d at 975 (citing Kimball v. Sadaoka, 56 Haw. 675,
 
676, 548 P.2d 268, 269 (1976)). Faamama fails to identify any
 hypothetical defense that was allegedly impaired by defense
 counsel's actions at trial. See id. at 463-64, 848 P.2d at 976­
77. Thus, Faamama fails to demonstrate a claim for ineffective
 
assistance of trial counsel.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order entered on October 12, 2012 by the District
 Court is affirmed.
