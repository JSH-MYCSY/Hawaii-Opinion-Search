SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
This case involves an altercation that occurred between 
Defendant-Appellant Heather E. Heers ("Heers") and Shannon 
Kaneshiro ("Kaneshiro") on the evening of September 6, 2010, at a condominium unit in Waikoloa, Hawai
'i, and an assault by Heers 
against Kaneshiro that was alleged to have occurred as Kaneshiro walked outside the same condominium complex later that evening. In a bench trial conducted in the District Court of the Third 
1
Circuit ("District Court"),  the court found Heers guilty of the
offense of Assault in the Third Degree, Hawaii Revised Statutes

of Final Judgment and/or Order; Judgment of Conviction & Sentence
 
("Judgment") entered on October 16, 2012 by the District Court. 
On appeal, Heers contends that the District Court erred
 
in finding her guilty of Assault in the Third Degree because
 there was insufficient evidence to prove that she engaged in
 conduct causing Kaneshiro to suffer bodily injury. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment and resolve Heers's appeal as follows:
 
In order to sustain a conviction on its charge of
 
Assault in the Third Degree, the State was required to prove
 beyond a reasonable doubt that Heers (1) "cause[d]" (2) "bodily
 injury" (3) "to another person", with the mens rea of
 intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707­
712(1); see State v. Lima, 64 Haw. 470, 474, 643 P.2d 536, 539
 (1982) ("[A]n accused in a criminal case can only be convicted
 upon proof by the prosecution of every element of the crime
 charged beyond a reasonable doubt.") (citing State v. Nuetzel, 61
 Haw. 531, 606 P.2d 920 (1980)). Heers contends that, even when
 the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the
 prosecution, the State failed to adduce substantial evidence to
 establish the conduct element of the offense, namely, that Heers
 caused Kaneshiro's injury. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 702-205 (1993).
 
A trial court, "as trier of fact, 'may draw all 
reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions from the evidence adduced[.]'" State v. Pone, 78 Hawai
'i 262, 273, 892 
P.2d 455, 466 (1995) (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 245­46, 831 P.2d 924, 930 (1992)). Despite the fact that Kaneshiro was unable to identify Heers as the person who caused her injury, 
2(...continued)
 
person with a dangerous instrument.

 
(2) Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor
unless committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by
mutual consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 707-712 (1993).
 
2
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstantial evidence was introduced at trial from which the
 
District Court could reasonably infer that Heers committed the
 crime. See id.
 
Kaneshiro testified that she was not injured during her
 
altercation with Heers at the party inside the condominium. She
 testified, however, that when she returned to the condominium
 complex area, she saw Heers on the lanai of the condominium and
 recognized Heers's voice yelling at her from the other side of
 the fence. As she continued walking along the sidewalk next to
 the complex, she then heard someone moving through the grass
 toward her. The next thing that she remembered was waking up on
 the sidewalk. 
According to Taividi Justin Taylor ("Taylor"), a former
 
co-worker of Heers, Heers told him, "you should['ve] seen my
 fight last night, it was like a UFC fight." He also said that
 Heers related that she "pounded on" Kaneshiro. Finally, Taylor
 testified that Heers said the fight occurred outside of her home. 
Heers testified that the fight had occurred earlier in 
the evening inside the condominium, and that she had not beaten up Kaneshiro outside later at night. The trial court, as fact-finder, presumably found Heers's testimony not to be credible. See State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996) 
("It is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of fact[.]" (citing Lono v. State, 63 Haw. 470, 473, 629 P.2d 630, 633 (1981)). 
In sum, viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the prosecution, there was substantial evidence adduced at trial to support the conclusion that Heers caused Kaneshiro's bodily injury, thereby committing the offense of Assault in the Third Degree. State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 33, 
960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai 'i 
128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 (1997)); H AW. REV. STAT. § 707-712(1). 
The argument that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction is without merit. 
Therefore,
