HARRY J. COLES, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0774)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Harry J. Coles (Coles) appeals pro
 
se from the October 26, 2012 Order 1) Denying Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 Custody; 2) Denying All Pending Motions (Order Denying Post-
Conviction Relief), entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (Circuit Court).

In Criminal No. 07-1-0774, after a jury trial, Coles
 
was convicted of Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-836 (Supp. 2006)
 
(Unauthorized Control) and Possessing Intoxicating Liquor While
 Operating Motor Vehicle in violation of HRS § 291-3.1(b) (Supp.
 
2006). Coles filed an appeal. On May 11, 2009, this court

 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
affirmed the judgment of conviction. Coles's application for a
 
writ of certiorari was rejected.
 
On June 8, 2012, Coles filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (Rule 40 Petition), asserting numerous grounds
 
for relief. On October 26, 2012, the Circuit Court entered the
 
Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief, which denied the Rule 40
 Petition without a hearing.
 
Although considerable effort is evident, Coles's 
opening brief does not comply with the requirements of Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28, including that the brief fails to consistently cite to the record on appeal. These deficiencies hamper our review. We, nevertheless, have attempted to review the merits of Coles's arguments. See O'Connor v. 
Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai
'i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994) ("the policies of this court are to permit litigants to appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible") (citations omitted); see also Hawaiian Props., Ltd. v. Tauala, 125 Hawai
'i 176, 181 n.6, 254 P.3d 487, 492 n.6 (App. 
2011). 
Coles argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
denied the Rule 40 Petition without a hearing and raises the
 following points of error:
 
(1) The trial court erred by failing to instruct the
 
jury regarding the "agent affirmative" defense in HRS § 708-836
 (Supp. 2006);
 
(2) There was insufficient evidence to support his
 
conviction;
 
(3) The trial court erred in its jury instruction
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
regarding the elements of Unauthorized Control and with respect
 
to a mistake-of-fact instruction;
 
(4 & 5) In discovery, the prosecution failed to
 
provide the defense with evidence favorable to the defense;
 
(6) The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction
 
over Coles's sentencing;
 
(7) The revocation of Coles's probation was improper;
 (8) Coles received ineffective assistance of trial
 
counsel; and
 
(9) Coles received ineffective assistance of appellate
 
counsel.
 
In 
Dan v. State, 76 Hawai 'i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 
(1994), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that the issue of whether 
a trial court erred in denying a Rule 40 petition without a hearing based on the failure to show a colorable claim is reviewed on appeal de novo; thus, the right/wrong standard of review is applicable. Additionally, in Stanley v. State, 76 Hawai
'i 446, 450, 879 P.2d 551, 555 (1994), the supreme court 
noted that 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) restricts the issues that may be raised
in a post-conviction proceeding and provides in pertinent
part that "said proceeding shall not be available and relief
thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to
be raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived."
 
The supreme court recently reiterated the standards
 
applicable to a Rule 40 petition:
 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) provides as follows:
 
Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief
thereunder shall not be granted where the issues
sought to be raised have been previously ruled upon or
were waived. Except for a claim of illegal sentence,
an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and
understandingly failed to raise it
 and it could have
been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
in a habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding
actually conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually
initiated under this rule, and the petitioner is
unable to prove the existence of extraordinary
circumstances to justify the petitioner's failure to
raise the issue. There is a rebuttable presumption
that a failure to appeal a ruling or to raise an issue
is a knowing and understanding failure.
 
(Emphases added [by supreme court]).
 
Thus, "an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly
and understandingly failed to raise it" (a rebuttable
presumption of knowing and understanding failure arises from
such omission), "and it could have been raised before the
trial, at the trial, on appeal, ... [in] any other
proceeding actually conducted, or in a prior proceeding
actually initiated under [Rule 40], and the petitioner is
unable to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances
to justify ... failure to raise the issue." Fragiao v.
State, 95 Hawai' i 9, 15–16, 18 P.3d 871, 877–78 (2001). 
This court has held that a claim of ineffective
 
assistance of counsel is not considered "waived" for the
 purposes of an HRPP Rule 40 petition if there was "no
realistic opportunity" for the petitioner to raise the claim
in the proceedings specified by the rule. See Briones v.
 
State, 74 Haw. 442, 459–60, 848 P.2d 966, 975 (1993)
(holding that petitioner was unable to raise ineffective
assistance of counsel issue on direct appeal where
petitioner was represented by same counsel at trial and on
direct appeal); Fragiao
, 95 Hawai' i at 16, 18 P.3d at 878
(2001) (finding no waiver of claim asserting trial counsel's
conflict of interest where petitioner was unaware of
conflict until new appellate counsel was appointed).
 
In De La Garza, we held that a petitioner seeking
postconviction relief under HRPP Rule 40 presented
sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that he
knowingly and understandingly waived the issue. 129 Hawai
'i 
at 443, 302 P.3d at 711. In that case, De La Garza asserted
that he did not receive evidence containing adverse
information in an HPA file prior to his second hearing and
was thus deprived of a "meaningful opportunity to be heard
on the issue of the minimum term." Id. at 441–42, 302 P.3d
at 709–10. The ICA held that De La Garza had waived the
 issue by failing to raise it in the Rule 40 Petition. Id. at
442, 302 P.3d at 710. This court vacated the ICA's holding
and held that "a claim . . . is not considered 'waived' for
 the purposes of a HRPP Rule 40 petition if there was 'no
realistic opportunity' for the petitioner to raise the
claim[.]" Id. at 442–43, 302 P.3d at 710–11.
 
Fagaragan v. State, __ Hawai 'i __, 320 P.3d 889, **9-10 (2014). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve Coles's arguments on appeal as
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
follows:
 
(1 & 3) We find no error in the trial court's jury
 
instructions. There is no evidence that Coles received
 
authorization from an agent of the owner. A mistake-of-fact
 instruction, rather than an "agent affirmative" instruction, was
properly given to the jury. Also, the trial court's deletion of
redundant language in the instruction on the offense of
 Unauthorized Control was not erroneous.
   
(2) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
 
to the State, which we must do, we conclude that there was
 sufficient evidence to support Coles's Unauthorized Control
 conviction.
 
(4 & 5) 
There is no evidence, either in the record or
 
by way of submission of additional evidence in conjunction with
 the Rule 40 Petition, supporting Coles's assertions regarding
 discovery violations. These claims are without merit.
 
(6) Coles's assertion that the trial court lacked
 
subject matter jurisdiction over his sentencing is without merit.
 
(7) We find no error related to the revocation of
 
Coles's probation.
 
(8) In his direct appeal, Coles raised, inter alia, 
the contention that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In its May 11, 2009 Summary Disposition Order, this court ruled, inter alia, that "Coles' ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit." Thus, the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel has been previously ruled upon and relief may not be provided pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 40. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(9) To the extent that Coles asserts appellate 
counsel's failure to raise the above-referenced issues, we 
conclude that his claim is without merit. Coles's general contention that appellate counsel otherwise failed to identify grounds for an appeal is insufficient to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See State v. Wakisaka, 102 
Hawai
' 504, 514, 78 P.3d 317, 327 (2003) ("defendant has the 
burden of establishing . . . 1) that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense"). 
Although not raised as a point of error, Coles also
 
argues that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to
 remove juror #20. Coles did not object to juror #20. His
 contentions are entirely speculative. This argument is without
 merit.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 26, 2012 
Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief is affirmed.
