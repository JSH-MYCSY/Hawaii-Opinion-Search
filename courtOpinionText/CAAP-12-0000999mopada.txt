order was entered October 31, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
First Circuit  (circuit court).
I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellees Trustees 
Under the Will and of the Estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, Deceased, also known as Kamehameha Schools (Kamehameha Schools) 
sought to cancel the lease of 0.54 acres in Punalu
fu (Punaluf u 
Beach Lots; Tax Map Key (TMK) No. (1) 5-3-001-029) and establish its rights to possession in that property. The lease was 
acquired by Jeffrey Vegas and Kerenakupu Esera-Vegas (the 
Vegases) in April 2007. Kamehameha Schools moved for summary 
judgment alleging the Vegases had failed to pay lease rent, 
taxes, and other fees and charges in the amount of $163,116.24. 
The Vegases opposed Kamehameha Schools' motion for summary 
judgment, claiming they should not be liable for rent payments 
because Lessor-Kamehameha Schools had not yet consented to the 
assignment of the lease, and had failed to repair seawalls or 
perform other flood mitigation work on the property. 
On June 20, 2012, the circuit court entered a Writ of
 
Possession and Judgment for Possession for Kamehameha Schools. 
The Vegases did not appeal from the circuit court judgment but
 
filed a counterclaim against Kamehameha Schools, alleging
 
landowner liability for flooding.
 
On August 30, 2012, Gora's cousin Amelia Gora (Amelia),
 
filed a post-judgment "Motion to Amend Eviction Decision/Writ of
 
Possession Decision By Judge Sakamoto Due to Non-Title of
 
Plaintiff in the Ahupuaa of Punaluu, Oahu; Affecting TMK (1) 5-3­
001-029," which claimed that she and Gora, held an interest in

the property. Amelia asserted "that the Vegas Family were given
 
authorization to help take care of our family(ies) interests
 
through a Protective Order on July 31, 2012, and an Amended
 
Protective Order prior to their wrongful eviction." On September
 
13, 2012, Gora also submitted a "Motion For Objection To
 
Eviction/Writ Of Possession Decision By Judge Sakamoto Due To,
 
Contested Matter, Hawaii Probate Rules, Rule 19" that raised
 
similar claims.
 
On October 16, 2012, the circuit court issued orders
 
denying Amelia and Gora's motions. The circuit court
 
"determine[d] that [Gora was] not a party to the present case 
and . . . failed to intervene despite his contention that he
 
along with Amelia Gora are the rightful owners of the Subject
 
Property." The circuit court added, "any attempt to intervene by
 
[Gora] would, at this point, be untimely." In concluding that a
 
motion to intervene would have been untimely on October 16, 2012,
 
eight days before Gora brought his October 24, 2012 motion to
 
intervene, the circuit court stated: 
The [circuit court] turns to Buscher v. Boning, [No. 28943
(App. Jan. 25, 2011) (SDO)] ("In evaluating the timeliness
of a motion to intervene, the court must consider 'the
totality of circumstances, but especially relevant is: (1)
the lapse of time between when [the proposed intervenor]
should have sought intervention and when it actually did;
and (2) the prejudice caused to the [parties] by the lapse
of time.'["]). Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this case
on May 5, 2009, and the Writ of Possession and Judgment was
filed on June 20, 2012. Defendants no longer reside at the
Subject Property.
 
On October 24, 2012, Gora filed a "Notice of Appeal to
 
the Circuit Court[,]" which included a "Motion to Intervene,
 
Hawaii Rule [sic] of Civil Procedures [sic], Rule 24
 
(Notice/Motion);"2 The circuit court denied the Notice/Motion on
 
2
 Rule 24(a) "Intervention of Right" provides:
 
Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to
intervene in an action: (1) when a statute confers an
unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant
claims an interest relating to the property or transaction
which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so
situated that the disposition of the action may as a
practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to

October 31, 2012 referring to the reasoning that it previously
 
set forth in its October 16, 2012 order as a basis for its
 
denial.
 
On November 8, 2012, Gora filed a timely notice of
 
appeal to this court.
 
On January 7, 2013, Kamehameha Schools filed a Motion
 
to Dismiss Appeal or Affirm Orders. On April 11, 2013, this
 
court issued an Order Denying the January 7, 2013 Motion to
 
Dismiss Appeal determining it has jurisdiction over Gora's appeal
 
"to the limited extent that the circuit court denied Appellant
 
Gora's request to intervene in this case" pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012).
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Motion to Intervene (intervention by right)
 
An order denying a motion to intervene pursuant to
HRCP Rule 24(a)(2) is reviewed under the right/wrong
standard. This court considers four factors in determining
intervention as of right pursuant to HRCP Rule 24 (a)(2):
(1) "whether the application was timely"; (2) "whether the
intervenor claimed an interest relating to the property or
transaction which was the subject of the action"; (3)
"whether the disposition of the action would, as a practical
matter, impair or impede the intervenor's ability to protect
that interest"; and (4) "whether the intervenor's interest
was inadequately represented by the existing defendants."
 
Hoopai v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 106 Hawaif i 205, 216, 103 P.3d 365, 
376 (2004) (citing Ing v. Acceptance Ins. Co., 76 Hawaif i 266, 
271, 874 P.2d 1091, 1096 (1994)). 
"Failure to meet even one [factor] prevents 
intervention 'by right' under HRCP Rule 24(a)(2)." Baehr v. 
Miike, 80 Hawaif i 341, 345, 910 P.2d 112, 116 (1996). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Gora fails to meet the first factor to intervene by
 
right. The first factor considered in a motion to intervene
 
protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is
adequately represented by existing parties.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
under HRCP Rule 24(a)(2) is whether the that motion was timely. 
Hoopai, 106 Hawaif i at 216, 103 P.3d at 376. 
To determine whether the motion to intervene was timely, we
must consider the totality of circumstances, but especially
relevant is: (1) the lapse of time between when [applicants
for intervention] should have sought intervention and when
it actually did; and (2) the prejudice caused to the
[parties] by the lapse of time.
 
Ing, 76 Hawaif i at 271, 874 P.2d at 1096. 
"[M]otions to intervene filed after judgment has been
 
entered are viewed with disfavor; and the moving party has a
 
heavy burden to show facts or circumstances that justify
 
intervention at that late date." Chierighino v. Bowers, 2 Haw.
 
App. 291, 294, 631 P.2d 183, 186 (1981) (denying a motion to
 intervene because it was filed more than two years after judgment
 
and "there [were] no circumstances justifying any delay at
 
all . . . ."). 
Gora filed his Notice/Motion on October 24, 2012,
 
several months after the circuit court entered its judgment on
 
June 20, 2012. Gora's attempt to intervene came nearly three
 
years after Kamehameha Schools filed its complaint on May 7,
 
2009.
 
Gora's Notice/Motion expressly acknowledges the circuit
 
courts' finding that his attempt to intervene was untimely
 
("Francis Gora's Motion came about three months after the filing
 
of the Writ of Possession and Judgment of Possession and is
 
considered untimely"), but he does not describe facts or
 
circumstances justifying his belated attempt to intervene.
 
Granting Gora's Notice/Motion would result in prejudice
 
against Kamehameha Schools, who has relied upon the finality of
 
the circuit court's judgment as to its rights in the property and
 
has obtained possession of the property.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Because the circuit court did not err in denying Gora's
 
motion to intervene, the "Order Denying Francis Gora's Notice of
 
Appeal to the Circuit Court; Statement of the Case; Exhibit F;
 
Designation of Record on Appeal; Order for Certification;
