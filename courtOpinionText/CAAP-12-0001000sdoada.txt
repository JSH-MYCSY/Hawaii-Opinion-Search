STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TIMOTHY W. BIELER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KONA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-12-01474)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Timothy W. Bieler (Bieler) appeals
 
from the Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on
 
September 11, 2012, in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 North and South Kona Division (District Court).
1 After a bench
 
trial, the District Court found Bieler guilty of one count of
 Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp.
 2014).
2
 
On appeal, Bieler argues that the District Court (1)
 
plainly erred in admitting into evidence, without a sufficient
 foundation, Officer Aaron Tanaka's (Officer Tanaka) testimony

 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo presided.

 HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
regarding the result of Bieler's Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)
 
test; and, as a result, wrongly (2) admitted into evidence
 Officer Tanaka's opinion testimony that Bieler was under the
 influence of alcohol because it was based in part on the HGN test
 results; and (3) relied on the HGN test results as substantive
 evidence of Bieler's impairment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Bieler's points of error as follows.
 
Bieler waived his argument that the District Court 
erroneously admitted Officer Tanaka's testimony regarding the HGN test results when Bieler failed to object to the testimony, at trial. See State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai
'i 382, 410, 910 P.2d 695, 
723 (1996); see also State v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawai 'i 206, 224-25, 
297 P.3d 1062, 1080-81 (2013) ("objections to the admissions of incompentent evidence, which a party failed to raise at trial, are generally not subject to plain error review"); State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 570-71, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980); State v. Gonsales, 125 Hawai
'i 244, 257 P.3d 1221, No. 30066, 2011 WL 
661917 at *3 (App. Feb. 24, 2011) (SDO); State v. Heffelfinger, 126 Hawai
'i 473, 272 P.3d 1240, CAAP-11-0000063, 2012 WL 603967 
at *1 (App. Feb. 24, 2012) (SDO). We need not address Bieler's remaining arguments, which are premised on his assertion that the HGN test results were erroneously admitted. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Judgment and
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment, entered on September 11, 2012, in
 the District Court of the Third Circuit, Kona Division, is
 affirmed
