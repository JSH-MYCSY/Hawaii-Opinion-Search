STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM A. KERNSTOCK, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-12-03599)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant William Alan Kernstock (Kernstock) 
appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence for 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61 (Supp. 
2011) and Excessive Speeding in violation of HRS ยง 291C-105(a)(1) 
(2007) entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, 'Ewa 
Division, (District Court) on October 16, 2012.1 
On appeal, Kernstock argues that the District Court
 
erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress the results of the
 breath test because he was asked while in custody whether he
 
wanted to incriminate himself in the petty misdemeanor offense of
 
refusing to take an alcohol test without being read his Miranda
 
rights; (2) denying his motion to suppress the results of the
 
breath test because he was misinformed of his statutory right to

an attorney; (3) denying his motion to suppress the results of
 
the breath test when the police informed him that he "shall" be
 
subject to thirty days in jail for refusing; and (4) failing to
 
grant his motion for acquittal due to the State's failure to lay
 
an adequate foundation for evidence from the speed gun.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the record and the applicable
 
authority, we resolve Kernstock's issues on appeal as follows:
 
Kernstock's first three issues regarding the admission 
of his breath-alcohol test results were raised, on similar facts, 
in State v. Yong Shik Won, --- Hawai 'i ---, ---P.3d. ---, No. 
CAAP-12-0000858, 2014 WL 1270615 (App. Mar. 28, 2014, amended May 2, 2014), in which we rejected the same arguments. Based on 
Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied 
Kernstock's motion to suppress. 
Kernstock also argues that there was insufficient 
foundation for the admission of the reading from the Laser 
Technology Incorporated (LTI) laser speed gun because there was 
no evidence the operating officer was trained directly by LTI, 
the manufacturer, the manual used in the officer's training was 
an HPD manual and not from the manufacturer, there was no 
indication of how many hours the officer was trained, and no 
indication of what the manufacturer's training requirements were. 
Given the foundational requirements most recently articulated in 
State v. Amiral, 132 Hawai
'i 170, 319 P.3d 1178 (2014), we agree 
with Kernstock that the operating officer's testimony as to his training was insufficient to "lay an adequate foundation for the 
introduction of the laser gun reading, and thus the trial court 
erred in admitting the speed reading into evidence." Id. at 179, 
319 P.3d at 1187. Therefore, consistent with the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court's mandate in Amiral, we vacate Kernstock's 
conviction for Excessive Speeding and remand that count for 
further proceedings. Id. at 180, 319 P.3d at 1188. 
Therefore, the October 16, 2012 Judgment of the 
District Court of the First Circuit, 'Ewa Division is affirmed in 
2

part and vacated in part. The conviction for OVUII is affirmed
 
and the conviction for Excessive Speeding is vacated and remanded
 
for further proceedings.
