GENBAO GAO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1154)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Genbao Gao (Gao) appeals from the
 
January 3, 2012 Judgment, the October 18, 2012 Amended Judgment,
 
and the November 25, 2011 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
 
and Order" (FOFs/COLs/Order) all entered in the Circuit Court of
1
the First Circuit  (circuit court).  The judgments were entered
 
in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Paul Perrone (Perrone), whose May
 
19, 2009 Complaint asserts defamation claims against Gao.
 
On appeal, Gao contends the circuit court erred by:
 (1) issuing a default judgment against Gao on September
 
3, 2010;
 
(2) denying Gao's motion for directed verdict by order
 
issued on October 24, 2011, his motion for renewed motion for
 judgment as a matter of law on February 6, 2012, and failing to

 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided. An Order of Reassignment from
Judge Trader to the Honorable Karen T. Nakasone of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit was issued on October 31, 2011. Judge Trader, however,
continued to preside over the proceedings until the final judgment was issued
on January 3, 2011. Judge Nakasone issued the Amended Judgment, filed October
18, 2012.

"reverse[] the harsh sanction of default [judgment;]" and
 
(3) awarding Perrone special, general, and punitive
 
damages.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Gao was employed by the State of Hawai 'i as a 
statistician since 1996. In 2003, he was transferred to the 
Crime Prevention and Justice Assistance Division of the 
Department of the Attorney General of the State of Hawai 'i 
(CPJAD). On May 19, 2009, Perrone, Gao's supervisor at CPJAD, filed a Complaint alleging that Gao had been publishing 
defamatory statements against him since 2005. Perrone's 
Complaint stated in relevant part: 
8. Beginning in or about 2005, [Gao] began publishing
statements defaming [Perrone] and injuring [Perrone's]
professional reputation, to wit:
 
a) [Gao] falsely claimed Plaintiff maintained a
personal Web site on a State-funded Internet account of the
CPJAD and thereby committed theft;
 
b) [Gao] falsely claimed [Perrone] arrived hours late
to work;
 
c) [Gao] falsely claimed [Perrone] did not know how to
conduct research;
 
d) [Gao] falsely accused [Perrone] of criminally
assaulting him and initiated a police investigation thereof
at the CPJAD;
 
e) [Gao] falsely accused [Perrone] of racial
discrimination against him at the CPJAD[.]
 
On June 26, 2009, Gao filed an answer to Perrone's 
Complaint and asserted counterclaims, alleging Perrone violated 
the Hawai 'i Whistleblowers Protection Act, Hawai 'i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) Chapter 378 et seq., and claimed that he was entitled to relief for Perrone's negligent and intentional 
inflictions of emotional distress and defamation of Gao. Perrone 
filed an answer to Gao's counterclaim on November 27, 2009. 
On March 18, 2010, Perrone filed a "Motion To Compel
 
Discovery And For Sanctions Against [Gao] And For Attorney's Fees
 
And Costs" (Motion to Compel Discovery), which included default
 
against Gao. Perrone's counsel, John R. Remis, Jr. (Remis)
 
declared that he had noticed Gao through his counsel, Greg I.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Nishioka (Nishioka) with a Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 34 "Request for Answers to Interrogatories and a 
Request for Protection of Documents," due December 31, 2009. 
Remis declared that he sent a letter to Nishioka on January 8, 
2010, requesting a response by January 15, 2010. Having received 
no response, Remis sent another letter to Nishioka on January 28, 
2010, which requested a response by February 5, 2010. No 
response had been produced as of March 2, 2010. 
On April 8, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
Perrone's Motion to Compel Discovery. Nishioka stated that Gao
 
"refused to sign off until he really looks it [the answer to
 
Perrone's discovery request] over" and that Gao filed no
 
opposition because he intended to comply with the discovery
 
request. Also at the hearing, Perrone's co-counsel, Robert D.
 
Eheler, Jr. (Eheler), referred to Nishioka as a "phantom lawyer"
 
because, save for a some emailed responses and one phone call,
 
Eheler and Remis "didn't hear from [Nishioka] at all" prior to
 
filing their answer to Gao's June 26, 2009 counterclaim. The
 
circuit court imposed a $250 sanction on Gao, ordered him to
 
provide requested answers and documents within ten calendar days
 
from April 8, 2010 (April 18, 2010), and denied Perrone's motion
 
for default judgment against Gao. On May 17, 2010, the circuit
 
court filed an order to this effect.
 
On April 19, 2010, Gao provided answers to Perrone's
 
interrogatories, but responded to only two of Perrone's document
 
requests. Nishioka, Gao's counsel, told Perrone's counsel that
 
the documents would be delivered to the copy center on May 3,
 
2010. Perrone's counsel alleged that these documents were not
 
available as of May 28, 2010 and did not become available until
 
approximately a week before the July 19, 2010 hearing.
 
On June 15, 2010, Perrone filed a "Motion To Preclude
 
Evidence And For Sanctions, Including Default [Judgment] And
 
Dismissal Of Counterclaim, Against [Gao,]" (Motion to Preclude)
 
and requested an award of attorneys' costs and fees.
 
On July 19, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
Perrone's Motion to Preclude. Gao was not present at the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing. Perrone's counsel noted that Gao's response to their
 
document request, which the circuit court had ordered due on
 
April 18, 2010, was tardy by "about three months[.]"
 
On September 3, 2010, the circuit court granted
 
Perrone's Motion to Preclude on the grounds that Gao
 
substantially failed to go along with the circuit court's
 
previous order that he comply with discovery requests by April
 
18, 2010. The circuit court entered default against Gao as to
 
liability only in relation to claims alleged in Perrone's May 19,
 
2009 Complaint and dismissed Gao's June 26, 2009 counterclaims. 
The circuit court also awarded Perrone's requested attorneys'
 
fees but reduced them to $1,000.
 
On October 20, 2010, Perrone filed a "Motion to Hold
 
[Gao] in Contempt of Court" for failure to pay $1,000 in
 
attorneys' fees. On November 23, 2010, the circuit court held a
 
hearing on this motion. Gao was present at this hearing and
 
stated that he believed "there is some kind of misunderstanding
 
between me and Nishioka regarding the fines and sanctions." In
 
response to the circuit court's inquiry into his reasons for
 
failing to pay $1,000 to Perrone as ordered on September 3, 2010,
 
Gao stated that his employment was terminated on January 20,
 
2009, he could not secure new employment, and the sanction should
 
be reconsidered because it resulted from a misunderstanding
 
between himself and Nishioka, with whom he was discussing the
 
matter. Nishioka argued that Gao's dire financial circumstances
 
should be taken into account in ruling on the contempt motion. 
The circuit court decided to deny Perrone's contempt motion but
 
affirmed its prior order of $1,000 in sanctions. At the close of
 
the hearing, the parties agreed the circuit court would assist
 
them in working out a settlement. On January 24, 2011, the
 
circuit court filed an order denying Perrone's motion to hold Gao
 
in contempt of court, but reaffirming its prior $1,000 sanction.
 
On February 15, 2011, the circuit court presided over a
 
settlement conference in which Perrone's counsel stated they
 
would not further discuss settlement options until Gao agreed to
 
withdraw a letter of complaint that Gao had sent to Governor Neil
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Abercrombie regarding Perrone. Gao stated he was not willing to
 
withdraw the letter. Perrone's counsel stated Perrone was
 
"suffering more damages right now as we speak" and requested the
 
circuit court enjoin Gao from writing any further letters. The
 
circuit court denied Perrone's oral request. Nishioka stated he
 
would be filing his motion to withdraw as counsel for Gao.
 
On May 3, 2011, Nishioka filed a "Motion to Withdraw as
 
[Gao's] Counsel" due to serious and irreconcilable differences
 
resulting from Gao's refusal to follow Nishioka's recommendation
 
and advice in the resolution of this case.
 
On May 19, 2011, Gao, proceeding pro se, filed a
 
"Motion to Correct Sactions [sic] Imposed Upon [Gao]" (Motion to
 
Correct Sanctions). In his memorandum in support of his motion,
 
Gao asserted that Nishioka failed to inform Gao of the April 8,
 
2010 hearing and falsely represented to the circuit court that
 
Gao had not provided him with Equal Employment Opportunity
 
Commission (EEOC) documents and that Gao had been asked to obtain
 
EEOC documents in response to Perrone's discovery request. Gao
 
appended several exhibits consisting in emails to and from
 
Nishioka:
 
(1) the July 14, 2010 email in which Gao noted Nishioka
 
had failed to notify him of the April 8, 2010 hearing and in
 
which Gao wrote
 
the [circuit] court had ordering against me [sic] for not
attending. Even though you paid the fine, it must have left
some negative image to the [circuit] court. I personally
would like to attend the hearing just in case things needs
to be clarified in court. Please let me know when and where
 to meet you for the hearing. Thanks.
 
(2) the July 16, 2010 email in which, Gao again, stated
 
he planned to attend the hearing even though Nishioka had not
 
replied to his earlier message;
 
(3) the July 17, 2010 email where Gao wrote: "[f]or
 
documents dissemination, I leave it to you. . . . I do not know
 
the meaning of discoverable and do not want to interfere with
 
your decision. I leave the matters to you[;]"
 
(4) the July 19, 2010 email in which Gao stated that he
 
spoke with his union representative, Robert Doi, and decided not
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to attend the hearing "as advised[;]" and
 
(5) the October 27, 2010 email where Gao wrote that he
 
consulted circuit court documents and discovered Nishioka had
 
made false statements at the July 19, 2010 hearing and requested
 
Nishioka correct those statements as well as the April 8, 2010
 
statement that Gao had refused to sign off on discovery
 
documents.
 
On June 16, 2011, attorney Daphne Barbee (Barbee)
 
entered an appearance as Gao's counsel.
 
On June 22, 2011, the circuit court issued a minute
 
order denying Gao's Motion to Correct Sanctions finding that Gao
 
failed to cite any legal authority or case law to warrant the
 
requested relief.
 
On July 8, 2011, Gao filed a "Motion to Compel
 
Discovery."
 
On August 5, 2011, Gao filed a "Motion for Judgment on 
the Pleadings." 
In substance, Gao contended Perrone was barred 
from seeking compensation for damages from Gao by exclusivity provisions in Hawai
'i's Workers' Compensation Law, HRS § 386-5 
(1993). 
On August 18, 2011, Gao filed a second "Motion to
 
Compel Discovery."
 
On August 30, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on 
Gao's "Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings" and "Motion to Compel Discovery." Gao contended the four corners of Perrone's 
Complaint established that any damages suffered arose out of the 
employment relationship and therefore his exclusive remedy lies 
with Hawai
'i's workers' compensation funds. Perrone countered 
that his Complaint contained allegations of Gao's wanton and malicious conduct not covered by HRS § 386-5 and requested 
injunctive relief, which is not available under Hawai
'i's 
workers' compensation scheme. The circuit court noted that it could not find any allegation in the Complaint that the type of 
conduct complained of was within Gao's normal scope of work and 
denied Gao's motion on the basis that workers' compensation 
exclusivity provisions did not apply. The circuit court also 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
stated it would "require [Perrone] to make a good faith and
 
diligent efforts [sic] to provide essentially everything that
 
they have that is responsive to the [discovery] request made."
 
On September 2, 2011, the circuit court filed its order
 
granting Gao's "Motion to Compel Discovery."
 
On September 22, 2011, the circuit court filed its
 
order denying Gao's "Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings," which
 
included the finding "that the Complaint clearly alleges [Gao]
 
acted [willfully,] wantonly, oppressively and with malice and, as
 
such, [the circuit court] found that it is clear that Worker's
 
Compensation does not apply[.]"
 
A jury-waived trial was held on October 3 and 5, 2011. 
Both Gao and Perrone made oral motions for a directed verdict
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 50 and the circuit court denied them both
 
stating it would deny the motions because it found "sufficient
 
conflicting evidence that can reasonably viewed by a reasonable
 
trier of fact to support essentially a decision in favor of not
 
only [Perrone], but arguably [Gao]."
 
On October 24, 2011 the circuit court filed an order
 
denying Gao's Motions for Sanctions and another order denying
 
Gao's Rule 50 "Motion for [a] Directed Verdict."
 
On October 26, 2011, Gao filed a "Motion for Judgment
 
as a Matter of Law; Motion to Vacate, Alter, or Amend Judgment or
 
Set Aside Default Motion for New Trial; Motion to Stay Judgment
 
on Appeal" (Motions for Judgment/Vacate). Exhibit 2, attached to
 
Gao's motion, was "[Gao's] Responses to [Perrone's] First Request
 
for Production of Documents and Things to [Gao]" dated April 19,
 
2010 and "[Gao's] Responses to [Perrone's] First Request for
 
Answers to Interrogatories to [Gao]," notarized April 16, 2010.
 
On October 31, 2011, the instant case was reassigned to
 
the Honorable Judge Karen T. Nakasone.
 
On November 22, 2011, Perrone filed an opposition to
 
Gao's Motions for Judgment/Vacate. Perrone contended Gao's
 
Motions for Judgment/Vacate were premature because: (1) a motion
 
for directed verdict pursuant to HRCP Rule 50(b) must be made
 
after entry of judgment; (2) a motion to vacate, alter, or amend
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment or set aside default pursuant to HRCP 59(b) requires
 
entry of judgment as a condition precedent; (3) motions to amend
 
or alter judgments under HRCP Rule 60(b) are authorized only in
 
situations involving final judgments (citing Crown Properties,
 
Inc. v. Fin. Sec. Life Ins. Co., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d
 
504, 509 (1985)); (4) a motion for relief under HRCP Rule 62
 
requires entry of judgment; and (5) noncompliance with other
 
applicable court rules.
 
On November 25, 2011, the circuit court filed its
 
FOFs/COLs/Order, including FOF 18, "[a]s a result of the [circuit
 
c]ourt's sanction [filed September 3, 2010] entering default
 
against [Gao], he is precluded from challenging liability at
 
trial. He, otherwise, is entitled to defend on issues relating
 
to causation and damages." The circuit court awarded Perrone
 
special damages in the amount of $5,943.76, general damages in
 
the amount of $20,000, and punitive damages in the amount of
 
$25,000, as well as injunctive relief.
 
On December 12, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing
 
on Gao's Motions for Judgment/Vacate. In response to the circuit
 
court's inquiry into Gao's delay in filing a motion to set aside
 
the default judgment, Gao's counsel, Barbee, stated that Gao had
 
filed a motion for reconsideration as a pro se party on May 19,
 
2011 and Barbee raised the issue in motions in limine and in
 
pretrial matters. Barbee filed three motions in limine on behalf
 
of Gao on September 12, 2011. The circuit court stated that
 
Gao's motions were "essentially premature" because a final
 
judgment had not yet been filed and denied the Motions for
 
Judgment/Vacate without prejudice. On December 14, 2011, the
 
circuit court filed an order to this effect.
 
On January 3, 2012, the circuit court filed its
 
Judgment, awarding a total of $50,943.76 as damages in favor of
 
Perrone and issuing an injunction, preventing Gao "from making
 
defamatory statements about [Perrone] to third-parties" for five
 
years.
 
On January 6, 2012, Gao filed a "Renewed Motion for
 
Judgment as a Matter of Law; Motion to Vacate, Alter, or Amend
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Judgment [filed January 3, 2012] or Set Aside Default Motion for
 
New Trial; Motion to Stay Judgment on Appeal" (Renewed Motions
 
for Judgment/Vacate). A hearing was held on the motion January
 
26, 2012.
 
On February 2, 2012, Gao filed his notice of appeal
 
from the January 3, 2012 Judgment under CAAP-12-0000062.
 
On February 6, 2012, the circuit court filed its "Order
 
Denying [Gao's Renewed Motions for Judgment/Vacate] and Motion to
 
Stay the Injunction, and Order Granting [Gao's] Motion to Stay
 
Damages Upon Conditions."
 
Under CAAP-12-0000062, this court entered the following 
orders:
 
(1) the February 23, 2012 order granting a motion by
 
Barbee to withdraw as Gao's counsel (with Anthony T.J. Quan
 
filing a notice of appearance as new counsel for Gao on April 18,
 
2012);
 
(2) the February 24, 2012 order denying Gao's motion
 
for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis; and
 
(3) the August 7, 2012, order dismissing Gao's appeal
 
for lack of jurisdiction because the circuit court's January 3,
 
2012 Judgment only entered judgment as to Perrone's defamation
 
claim - and did not resolve Gao's counterclaim nor contain an
 
express finding as to other claims as required by HRCP Rule
 
54(b).
 
On October 18, 2012, the circuit court filed an Amended
 
Judgment, dismissing "Gao's counterclaim as well as all other
 
claims[.]" On November 16, 2012, Gao filed an appeal from the
 
Amended Judgment under CAAP-12-0001008.
II. DISCUSSION
 
A circuit court acts within its authority under 
Hawai'i's formal rules for civil procedure when it awards 
sanctions, including default judgment against a party that fails 
to comply with discovery orders.2 We review the circuit court's 
2
 A motion to compel discovery is appropriate, after reasonable notice
to other parties, where a party has failed to answer an interrogatory or to
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
September 3, 2010 Order Granting the Motion to Preclude imposing
 
default judgment as a sanction for abuse of discretion. 
The imposition of a sanction is generally within the
discretion of the trial court. In reviewing whether a trial
court's dismissal of a claim as a discovery sanction
constitutes an abuse of discretion, appellate courts
consider the following five factors: (1) the public's
interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation; (2)
the court's need to manage its docket; (3) the risk of
prejudice to the [party moving for sanctions]; (4) the
public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits;
and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions.
 
Weinberg V. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawai 'i 68, 71, 229 P.3d 1133, 
1136 (2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
The first and second Weinberg factors favor Perrone
 
over Gao's tardy responses, which were the substantial reason
 
that this case remained in the circuit court's docket from May
 
2009 to February 2012. See Aloha Unlimited, Inc. v. Coughlin, 79
 
Hawai'i 527, 533, 904 P.2d 541, 547 (App. 1995) (weighing the 
first two factors against a party that failed to comply with
 
court orders regarding the opposing party's discovery requests). 
On July 19, 2010, the circuit court offered the following
 
statement in support of its decision to grant Perrone's motion
 
for sanctions: 
the bottom line is months went by and nothing happened. And
 
if [the circuit court] were to allow this to happen in every
case, the orderly administration of discovery as well as the
handling of the case would just be chaotic. And to me, it
does a disservice not only to the parties involved whether
it be [Perrone] in this situation, but also to the integrity
of the judicial process.
 
Under the third Weinberg factor, we consider whether
 
Gao's actions amounted to "actual prejudice" that impaired
 
2(...continued)
produce documents for inspection in accordance with a discovery request. HRCP
 Rule 37(a)(2). "The motion must include a certification that the movant has
 in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party
failing to make the discovery in an effort to secure the information or
material without court action." Id. Failure to comply with an order
compelling discovery permits the court in which the action is pending to "make
such orders in regard to the failure as are just" including "rendering a
judgment by default against the disobedient party[.]" HRCP Rules 37(b)(2) and
37(b)(2)(C). Additionally, the circuit court "shall require the party failing
to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless
the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust." HRCP Rule 37(b)(2).

Perrone's "ability to go to trial or threatened to interfere with
 
the rightful decision of the case." W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v.
 
Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., 8 Haw. App. 354, 364, 802
 P.2d 1203, 1208 (1990). 
At the July 19, 2010 hearing, Nishioka explained that
 
Gao had not opposed the motion for sanctions because they agreed
 
the counterclaim should be dropped and Nishioka had not filed a
 
written opposition because he "wasn't able to sit down and meet
 
with [his] client." Nishioka then stated that he thought "to
 
default [Gao] as far as the total case . . . that's a very harsh
 
sanction" and described "conceptual[]" difficulties relating to
 
Gao's understanding of the legal process. The circuit court
 
granted Perrone's Motion to Preclude, including, default because:
 
(1) Gao failed to file his answers to interrogatories until April
 
19, 2010 and thus "substantially failed to comply" with previous
 
orders requiring responses filed by April 18, 2010; and (2) Gao
 
did not submit a written opposition to the motion for sanctions. 
The circuit court noted the "documents that
 
nonetheless, perhaps, tardy, et cetera, [had] been provided" and
 
determined not to "take that [communications regarding document
 
production sent on April 19, 2010] as being noncompliance under
 
the circumstances here." Perrone's counsel clarified that the
 
full set of documents was not received until a week before the
 
July 19, 2010 hearing, nearly three months from the April 18,
 
2010 deadline. Gao, acting through his counsel, provided answers
 
to Perrone's interrogatories on April 19, 2010, but responded to
 
only two of Perrone's document requests. In sum, at the time of
 
the July 19, 2010 hearing, prejudice to Perrone consisted in
 
receiving Gao's responses a day late and documents several months
 
late. We conclude that Gao's actions did not amount to "actual
 
prejudice." Therefore, the third Weinberg factor weighs in Gao's
 
favor. W.H. Shipman, Ltd., 8 Haw. App. at 364, 802 P.2d at 1208. 
The fourth Weinberg factor also weighs in favor of Gao 
because entry of default judgment against him prevents 
consideration of the merits of the parties' cases. See Weinberg, 
123 Hawai
'i at 71, 229 P.3d at 1136. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Under the fifth Weinberg factor, the circuit court 
considered alternative, less drastic sanctions; however, the 
imposition of the particularly severe sanction of default 
judgment is subject to a particularized review of the circuit 
court's exercise of discretion. Weinberg, 123 Hawai 'i at 77, 229 
P.3d at 1142. Particularly severe sanctions, such as default judgment, should be supported by "evidence of willful or 
contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious behavior[.]" Weinberg, 123 
Hawai
'i at 77, 229 P.3d at 1142 (internal quotation mark 
omitted). Interpretations of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure (FRCP) Rule 37(b)(2), which has "substantially 
identical" provisions for the failure of a party to serve answers 
to interrogatories or respond to requests for inspection as those 
in HRCP Rule 37(d), have yielded a similar principle: 
[FRCP] Rule 37 should not be construed to authorize
dismissal of this complaint because of petitioner's
noncompliance with a pretrial production order when it has
been established that failure to comply has been due to
inability, and not to wilfulness, bad faith, or any fault of
petitioner.
 
W.H. Shipman, Ltd., 8 Haw. App. at 361, 802 P.2d at 1207 (quoting
 
Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et
 
Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 212 (1958) (emphasis
 
added) (FRCP Rule 37(b)(2) provisions are "deemed to be highly
 
persuasive in the construction of our parallel procedural
 
rules.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
Gao contends the circuit court should not have granted 
default judgment in favor of Perrone because Gao provided 
evidence of misrepresentations by, and miscommunication with, 
Gao's prior counsel, Nishioka, sufficient to establish a lack of 
"evidence of willful or contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious 
behavior" on the part of Gao himself. Weinberg, 123 Hawai 'i at 
77, 229 P.3d at 1142. 
Distinctions between the willful noncompliance of the
 
client, as opposed to an attorney, however, are properly
 considered when determining whether to impose default judgment as
 
a sanction against a party. "[T]he trial court should bear in
 
mind the culpability of the client in imposing sanctions for the

attorney's conduct, particularly the ultimate sanction of 
dismissal or default judgment." Stender v. Vincent, 92 Hawai 'i 
355, 364, 992 P.2d 50, 59 (2000). This court has held improper the imposition of a sanction "equivalent" to default judgment 
where party's attorney failed to appear at a hearing because" the 
sins of its attorney should not have been visited on [the 
defendant-appellant]." W.H. Shipman, Ltd., 8 Haw. App. at 364, 
802 P.2d at 1208. Instead of imposing severe sanctions against the offending-party, the Shipman court stated the lower court 
"should have sanctioned [the defendant-appellant's] attorney 
personally pursuant to HRCP Rule 37(d) or under its inherent 
powers under [HRS] § 603-21.9(6) (1985)." Id. (holding that the 
lower court abused its discretion in imposing evidentiary preclusion sanctions on the defendant-appellant) (citing Kukui 
Nuts of Hawai
'i, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., 6 Haw. App. 431, 437-38, 
726 P.2d 268, 272 (1986)). 
Here, the circuit court had clear notice of Gao's claim
 
that the discovery violations were attributable to the neglect of
 his attorney, and not to Gao himself. In his pro se Motion to
 
Correct Sanctions, Gao asserted that Nishioka had falsely
 
represented to the circuit court that Gao had been responsible
 
for the discovery delays, and Gao provided emails that indicated
 
that Nishioka may have been responsible for the delays. The
 
record also includes evidence of Nishioka's lack of diligence,
 
including his failure to file any responses to Perrone's sanction
 
motions and Perrone's counsel's references to Nishioka as a
 
"phantom lawyer." Under these circumstances, the circuit court
 
should have determined whether Gao or Nishioka was responsible
 
for the delay before denying Gao's Motion to Correct Sanctions,
 
which was essentially a motion to reconsider the default
 
sanction. This determination was critical in evaluating whether
 
Gao had engaged in willful or contemptuous behavior and thus
 
whether the severe default sanction was appropriate. Instead,
 
the circuit court denied the motion without a hearing.
 
Moreover, the non-compliance with a discovery deadline
 
by one day for answers to interrogatories and less than three
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
months for document production, while significant, was relatively
 
small when compared to the drastic default sanction. We conclude
 
that the combination of the circuit court's failure to determine
 
whether Gao was responsible for the discovery violations and the
 
severity of the sanction when compared to the discovery
 
violations indicates that the fifth factor weighs in favor of
 
Gao.
 
We conclude the circuit court abused its discretion by
 
imposing default judgment on liability claims as a sanction on
 
Gao.
 
III. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we vacate the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit's October 18, 2012 Amended Judgment, and the November 25,
 2011 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order". Gao's
 
other points of error are therefore moot.
