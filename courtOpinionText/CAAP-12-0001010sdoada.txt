On appeal,  the Teaupas maintain that the District
Court erred in issuing its Order, "despite [the Teaupas] 
providing factual and legal evidence that the Kingdom [of Hawai
'i] exists as a state in accordance with recognized 
attributes of a state's sovereign nature in compliance with 
[State v. ]Lorenzo
, [77 Hawai 'i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994)] 
thereby rebutting the presumption establishing subject matter jurisdiction of the court[.]" This evidence consisted of two executive agreements, the Lili
'uokalani assignment (January 17, 
1893) and the Agreement of restoration (December 18, 1893). The Teaupas' single point of error on appeal is without merit. 
First, the documents submitted by the Teaupas fail to
 
satisfy the requirements of District Court Rules of Civil
 Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60(b)(2), under which their motion was
 brought, which requires a showing of "newly discovered evidence
 which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to
 move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)." The Teaupas maintained
 that they "were not aware of this newly discovered evidence at
 the time of the ejectment proceedings" but have not claimed that
 this evidence could not have been discovered with due diligence.
 
In any event, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has ruled that 
"[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of its origins, the State of Hawai
'i is now a lawful government. State v. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), 
aff'd, 106 Hawai 'i, 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004)." State v. Kaulia, 
128 Hawai 'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (internal 
quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Therefore, the District

 The Teaupas' opening brief fails to conform to Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. For example, within their Statement of
the Points of Error, they fail to state where the alleged error occurred, andwhere the error was brought to the attention of the District Court. See HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(4). Such failure is sufficient to warrant disregard of the point.
However, as the Hawai' i Supreme Court observes a policy of affording pro se 
litigants the opportunity "to have their cases heard on the merits, where
possible[,]" O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d
361, 364 (1994), we will consider the Teaupas' arguments to the extent we candiscern them.

Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied their motion
 
for relief.
 
Therefore, the October 2, 2012 "Order Denying
 
Defendant's [sic] Motion for Relief from this Court's June 2,
 2011 Orders Granting Judgment for Possession and Writ of
 Possession and this Court's June 30, 2011 Order Granting Ex Parte
 Motion to Stay Execution of Writ of Possession and Judgment of
 Possession Filed June 28, 2012" is affirmed.
