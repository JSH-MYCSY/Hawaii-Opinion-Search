Appellant McGrath Properties I, LLC, a Hawaii Limited Liability
 
Company,” filed April 5, 2013, Appellees’ and “Motion to Dismiss
 Appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant Suzanne Kitamura, as Custodian for
 DAF, a Minor,” filed April 16, 2013, the papers in support, and
 the record and files herein, it appears that:
 
(1) On November 19, 2012, attorney Bobby A. Bautista
 
(Counsel) filed a notice of appeal on behalf of Plaintiff-
Appellant McGrath Properties I, LLC (Appellant McGrath
 Properties) and Suzanne Kitamura (Appellant Kitamura), as
 Custodian for DAF, a minor (Minor);
 
(2) Following an extension by the appellate clerk, the
 
opening brief was due by April 1, 2013;
 
(3) On April 3, 2013, the court found Appellant
 
Kitamura may also have an individual interest in this appeal, and
 granted Counsel’s March 20, 2013 motion for withdrawal as counsel
 of record for Appellant Kitamura individually and in her capacity
 as Custodian for Minor. The court further ordered that within
 ten (10) days from the date of the order, new counsel shall enter
 an appearance for Appellant Kitamura in her capacity as Custodian
 for Minor, otherwise the appeal may be dismissed as to Appellant
 Kitamura in her capacity as Custodian for Minor. If counsel
 timely entered an appearance, then the due date for the opening
 brief for Appellant Kitamura in her capacity as Custodian for
 Minor would be extended to May 23, 2013. The court also granted
 Appellant Kitamura’s March 25, 2013 pro se motion for a second
 extension to file an opening brief in her individual capacity,
 and extended the due date for that brief to May 3, 2013;
 
(4) Because Counsel did not move to withdraw as counsel
 
of record for Appellant McGrath Properties, he remains counsel of
 record for Appellant McGrath Properties, and the opening brief
 for Appellant McGrath Properties was due by April 1, 2013;
 
(5) Appellant McGrath Properties has not filed an
 
opening brief or requested an extension for the opening brief;
 
(6) Appellees seek dismissal of the appeal by Appellant 
McGrath Properties for failure to file an opening brief, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30;

(7) On April 12, 2013, the appellate clerk notified
 
Counsel that the time for filing the opening brief for Appellant
 
McGrath Properties had expired, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30, the
 matter would be called to the court’s attention on April 22,
 2013, for such action as the court deems proper, which could
 include dismissal, and any request for relief from default should
 be made by motion;
 
(8) Appellant McGrath Properties did not seek relief
 
from default of the opening brief; and
 
(9) The date by which new counsel was to enter an
 
appearance for Appellant Kitamura in her capacity as Custodian
 for Minor expired on April 15, 2013, and no appearance was
 entered. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees’ motion to dismiss
 
the appeal by Appellant McGrath Properties is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Appellees’ motion to dismiss
 
the appeal by Appellant Kitamura in her capacity as Custodian for
 Minor is granted.
