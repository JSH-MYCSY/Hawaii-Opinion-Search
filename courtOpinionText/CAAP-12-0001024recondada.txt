IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HOVEY B. LAMBERT, TRUSTEE UNDER THAT
HOVEY B. LAMBERT TRUST, an unrecorded Revocable Living Trust
Agreement dated April 5, 2002, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.

LESIELI TEISINA, Defendant-Appellant
and

PENISIMANI TEISINA, Intervenor-Appellant,
and

WAHA (K), et al, Defendants-Appellees

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2529)

ORDER DENYING THE MAY 22, 2013 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)

Upon review of (1) the May 16, 2013 order dismissing

this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendant-
Appellant Lesieli Teisina's and Intervenor-Defendant/Appellant

Penisimani Teisina's (the Teisina Appellants) May 22, 2013 motion

for reconsideration of the May 16, 2013 dismissal order pursuant

to Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook or

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
misapprehend any points of fact or law when we entered the

May 16, 2013 dismissal order, and, thus, the Teisina Appellants'

May 22, 2013 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the

May 16, 2013 dismissal order lacks merit.

[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

May 16, 2013 dismissal order is denied.
