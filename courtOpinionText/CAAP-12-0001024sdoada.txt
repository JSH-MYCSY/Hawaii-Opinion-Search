APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2529)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley and Fujise, JJ., with
Nakamura, C.J. concurring and dissenting separately)
 
The instant appeal arises from a dispute over two
 
parcels of land in L a'ie, O'ahu: Land Commission Award (LCA) 
Number 3741, Apana 4, within Tax Map Key (TMK) No. (1) 5-5-001Â­
035 (the Kuleana); and a portion of LCA No. 8559:B, Apana 26,
 
within TMK No. (1) 5-5-001-033 (Parcel 33). Defendant-Appellant
 
Lesieli Teisina (Lesieli) and her husband, Intervenor-
Defendant/Appellant Penisimani Teisina (Penisimani) (together,
 
the Teisinas) appeal from the October 25, 2012 "Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion to Allow Overbidding, to Confirm Sale, to
 
Account For and Direct Reimbursement of Expenses and Attorneys'
 Fees and to Disburse Net Proceeds" (Confirmation Order), entered

 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) in
 
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Hovey B. Lambert (Lambert), "Trustee
 
under the Hovey B. Lambert Trust, an unrecorded Revocable Living
 
Trust Agreement dated April 5, 2002."

 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Confirmation Order incorporates by reference the
 
circuit court's June 20, 2011 "Order Granting [Lambert's] Motion
 
for Summary Judgment Regarding Partition and Title, Filed April
 26, 2010" (June 20, 2011 Order); November 23, 2011 "Order
 
Granting [Lambert's] Motion: (1) for Summary Judgment Against
 
[Penisimani]; (2) for Determination of Interests, if any, of [the
 Teisinas] in House on Parcel 33; and (3) for Dissolution of the
 Court's Stay Entered August 24, 2011, Filed September 30, 2011"
 (November 23, 2011 Order); and February 23, 2012 "Order Granting
 
in Part and Denying in Part Motion of [the Teisinas] to Vacate
 
the Court's Order of November 23, 2011 To Sell Lot 33 Without the
 House and Improvements, Filed January 5, 2012" (February 23, 2012
Order).
 
On appeal, the Teisinas contend that the circuit court
 
erred by:
 
(1) denying Lesieli's two motions to dismiss in its
 
"Order Denying [Lesieli's] (1) Motion to Dismiss, Filed January
 
5, 2011, and (2) Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Failure to Name
 Indispensable Party, Filed January 11, 2011," filed March 22,
 2011 (March 22, 2011 Order) and denying her motion for
 
reconsideration of those two motions in its "Order Denying
 
[Lesieli's] Motion for Reconsideration of Granting Summary
 Judgment, Denial of [Lesieli's] Motion to Dismiss Due to
 Indispensable Party and Motion to Dismiss, Filed March 7, 2011,"
 filed May 4, 2011 (May 4, 2011 Order) because Lambert did not
 
comply with an earlier court order requiring him to pay
 
Penisimani $750;
 
(2) granting Lambert's January 3, 2011 motion for
 
summary judgment in its June 20, 2011 Order and September 30,
 2011 motion for summary judgment in its November 23, 2011 Order,
 because the Teisinas own a 10,000-square-foot portion of Parcel
 33 rather than just the house on Parcel 33;
 
(3) denying the Teisinas' requests for a determination
 
of "the value and use of the Teisinas' enhancement by the
 improvements on Parcel 33" in its: (i) February 23, 2012 Order;
 (ii) "Order Denying Motion of [the Teisinas] to 1) Reconsider the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court's Order Filed February 23, 2012, Granting and Denying in 
Part Teisinas' Motion to Vacate the November 23, 2011 Order; 2) to Hold and [sic] Evidentiary Hearing on Teisinas' Enhancement of Parcel 33; and 3) For an Order Allowing Teisinas to Use Their Enhancement Value in Bidding at the Partition Sale of Parcel 33, Filed February 28, 2012" filed May 3, 2012 (May 3, 2012
Enhancement Value Determination Order); (iii) "Order Denying 
Motion of [the Teisinas] to Use the Enhancement Value of the 
Improvements on Parcel 33 in Lieu of a Supersedeas Bond" filed May 3, 2012 (May 3, 2012 Supersedeas Bond Order); and (iv) the 
Teisinas Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) 
motion to certify orders for appeal in its "Order Denying Motion 
of [the Teisinas] for an Order Pursuant to [HRCP Rule] 54(b) to Certify as Final 1) The [June 20, 2011 Order] ; 2) [November 23, 2011 Order]; 3) [February 23, 2012 Order]; 4) Order Filed May 3, 2012 Denying Teisinas' February 28, 2012 Motion for Reconsideration; 5) Order Filed May 3, 2012 Denying Teisinas' Motion to Use the Enhancement Value to Parcel 33 in Lieu of a Supersedeas Bond; and 6) May 3, 2012 Order Denying Teisinas' Motion for Stay Pending Appeal" filed June 14, 2012 (June 14, 
2012 Order); 
(4) awarding the Teisinas only $150,000 for enhancement
 
value and then deducting Lambert's attorneys' fees and costs from
 
that award in its Confirmation Order;
 
(5) denying the Teisinas' motion to disqualify Judge
 
Nishimura in its "Order Denying [the Teisinas'] Motion to
 Disqualify Judge Rhonda Nishimura" filed August 6, 2012 (August
6, 2012 Order);
 
(6) refusing to award or deduct from Lambert's
 
attorneys' fees and costs $26,296 for the Teisinas' attorneys'
 
fees and costs in its Confirmation Order; and
 
(7) denying in part the Teisinas' motion to vacate the
 
circuit court's November 23, 2011 Order in its February 23, 2012
 Order, and denying the Teisinas' motion for stay pending appeal
 in its "Order Denying [the Teisinas'] Motion for Stay Pending
 Appeal, Filed October 31, 2011" filed May 3, 2012 (May 3, 2012

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Order Denying Motion for Stay) because the Teisinas were entitled
 
to have a jury determine (1) title to the 10,000 square foot
 
portion of Parcel 33, and (2) the enhancement value for Parcel 33
 resulting from the Teisinas' house and improvements.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm in part
 and vacate in part.
I.	 This court may review the circuit court's interlocutory
orders because they were either incorporated by reference
into the Confirmation Order, or preceded and are factually
and legally intertwined with the Confirmation Order.
 
Lambert contends that this court lacks jurisdiction
 
over the following issues raised by the Teisinas' appeal because
 
such issues were addressed in interlocutory orders that were not
 designated in the Teisinas' notice of appeal: 
(1) whether Lambert's alleged non-compliance with Judge
 
Sabrina S. McKenna's June 3, 2009 Order of Dismissal dismissing
 
2
Civil No. 96-0859-03  (McKenna's Order) prohibited Lambert from
 
filing his complaint for partition and quiet title to the Kuleana

 
and Parcel 33 (Complaint), which was addressed in the March 22,
 
2011 Order and the May 4, 2011 Order; 
(2)
 whether the Teisinas obtained title to Parcel 33
 
through adverse possession, which was addressed in the June 20,
 
2011 Order and November 23, 2011 Order; 
(3) whether the circuit court erred in denying the
 
Teisinas' motion to disqualify Judge Rhonda A. Nishimura, which
 was addressed in the August 6, 2012 Order; and 
(4) whether constitutional due process violations
 
occurred during various stages of the circuit court proceedings,
 violations which, according to the Teisinas, resulted from the
 March 22, 2011 Order; May 4, 2011 Order; June 20, 2011 Order;
 
2
 Civil No. 96-0859-03 was filed by Lambert's mother, Elizabeth P.
Lambert, as "Trustee Under That Unrecorded Living Trust Dated March 2, 1984,
As Amended." Lambert was apparently substituted as plaintiff after Elizabeth
Lambert passed away.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
November 23, 2011 Order; February 23, 2012 Order; June 14, 2012
 
Order; May 3, 2012 Enhancement Value Determination Order; May 3,
 2012 Supersedeas Bond Order; May 3, 2012 Order Denying Motion for
 Stay; August 6, 2012 Order; and the Confirmation Order.
 
With regard to issues addressed by the circuit court's
 
June 20, 2011 Order, November 23, 2011 Order, and February 23,
 2012 Order, Lambert's argument is without merit because these
 three orders were incorporated by reference into the Confirmation
 Order. For the reasons set forth below, Lambert's argument is
 also without merit with regard to the issues addressed by the
 circuit court's other interlocutory ordersâthe March 22, 2011
 Order, May 4, 2011 Order, August 6, 2012 Order, June 14, 2012
 Order, May 3, 2012 Enhancement Value Determination Order, and
 August 6, 2012 Order.
 
Lambert's reliance on Du Vall v. Lowes Companies, Inc.,
 
278 F. App'x 399 (5th Cir. 2008), an unpublished case, is
 misplaced. In Du Vall, the extra-jurisdictional orders were
 filed after the plaintiff filed his notice of appeal and thus
 presents circumstances distinguishable from the Teisinas' appeal. 
Du Vall, 278 F. App'x at 400. 
Lambert's reliance on Chun v. Bd. of Trustees of 
Employees' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawaii, 92 Hawai
'i 432, 992 P.2d 
127 (2000) is also misplaced. In Chun, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the circuit court's denial of a motion to disqualify because the appellants failed to designate the order denying the motion in their notice of appeal. Chun, 92 Hawai
'i at 447, 992 P.2d at 142. The Chun court 
explained that the appellants 
filed notices of appeal from (1) the circuit court's October
1, 1998 order granting the Board and the [Employees'Retirement System's (ERS)] motion to impose [Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)] Rule 11 Sanctions . . . and(2) the circuit court's October 21, 1998 order
granting . . . attorney's fees. The [appellants] did not
file a notice of appeal from the circuit court's July 17,
1998 order denying their request to disqualify counsel[.]
 
A post-judgment order is an appealable final order,
pursuant to [Hawaii Revised Statutes] Â§ 641-1(a) (1993), if
the order finally determines the post-judgment
proceeding. . . .
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Inasmuch as the circuit court's July 17, 1998 order
determined the rights of the ERS to continue to
retain . . . . its attorney, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished on the issue, the order was final.
Accordingly, the July 17, 1998 order was an appealable final
order.
 
The notice of appeal "shall designate the judgment,
order[,] or part thereof appealed from." HRAP Rule 3(c)
(1996). Inasmuch as [the appellants] did not, in either of
their notices of appeal, designate the July 17, 1998 order
as an order from which an appeal was being taken, they have
not properly appealed it. Accordingly, we lack appellate
jurisdiction over the propriety of the circuit court's
refusal to disqualify [the attorney].
 
Id. at 447-48, 992 P.2d at 142-43 (emphasis omitted).
 
The Chun court noted, however, that the appellants'
 
"argument that 'the motion to disqualify counsel, which was filed
 
in the lower court, was part and parcel of the motion for
 attorney's fees' is without merit. The two motions raised
 
distinct factual and legal issues, which were resolved in two
 separate orders." Id. at 448 n.11, 992 P.2d at 143 n.11
 
(emphasis added, brackets omitted). Although the Teisinas'
 contentions of circuit court error concern issues that were
 addressed in separate orders, the issues are factually and
 legally intertwined with those underlying the circuit court's
 Confirmation Order and therefore justice requires resolution of
 the issues raised but not properly appealed. 
Lambert also contends that the Teisinas' appeal raises 
issues outside of the scope of those that fall within the Forgay doctrine, an exception to the separate judgment rule that was developed in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). In Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai
'i 457, 319 P.3d 376 (2014), the Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court held that the "Confirmation Order meets the requirements of appealability under the Forgay doctrine," but did not address which issues could be appealed by the Teisinas as part of their appeal from the Confirmation Order. Lambert, 131 Hawai
'i at 462, 
319 P.3d at 381. The supreme court explained that "the Forgay doctrine permits a direct appeal from a non-final, interlocutory order or decree that commands the immediate transfer of property, where the losing party will be subjected to undue hardship and irreparable injury if appellate review must wait until the final 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
outcome of the litigation." Id. at 461, 319 P.3d at 380. The
 
supreme court further explained:
 
Although the October 25, 2012 Confirmation Order does not
command the immediate execution of the property to Trustee
Lambert, the order confirms the sale to Trustee Lambert,
directs the commissioner to convey the property to Trustee
Lambert, and orders the Teisinas to surrender the property
within 30 days of the conveyance. The Confirmation Order
 effectively terminates the Teisinas' rights to the property
and they will suffer irreparable injury if appellate review
is postponed until final judgment.
 
Id. at 462, 319 P.3d at 381. 
It is consistent with the purpose of the Forgay
 
doctrine for this court to address all of the Teisinas'
 
contentions on appeal because the issues addressed by the
 interlocutory orders are intertwined with those addressed by the
 Confirmation Order and therefore not addressing them would result
 in delay that would cause the Teisinas to suffer undue hardship
 and irreparable injury. 
We conclude that the Teisinas' contentions on appeal
 
raise issues properly before this court.
II.	 The circuit court did not err in denying the Teisinas'
motion to disqualify Judge Nishimura.
 
The Teisinas argue that the circuit court erred in
 
denying their motion to disqualify Judge Nishimura because they
 
submitted affidavits in good faith alleging that Judge Nishimura
 exhibited bias or prejudice against them and in favor of Lambert.
 The Teisinas argue, and the affidavits that they filed in support
 of their motion, allege that Judge Nishimura exhibited bias or
 prejudice by consistently ruling against them and in favor of
 Lambert. The Teisinas' argument is without merit.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Â§ 601-7(b) (1993)
 
provides, in pertinent part: 
Â§601-7 Disqualification of judge; relationship,
pecuniary interest, previous judgment, bias or
prejudice.
 
. . . .
 
(b) Whenever a party to any suit, action, or
proceeding, civil or criminal, makes and files an
affidavit that the judge before whom the action or
proceeding is to be tried or heard has a personal bias
or prejudice either against the party or in favor of
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
any opposite party to the suit, the judge shall be
disqualified from proceeding therein. Every such
affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for
 the belief that bias or prejudice exists and shall be
filed before the trial or hearing of the action or
proceeding, or good cause shall be shown for the
failure to file it within such time. . . . [N]o
affidavit shall be filed unless accompanied by a
certificate of counsel of record that the affidavit is
 made in good faith. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has clarified that when 
considering an affidavit that alleges bias or prejudice
 
pursuant to HRS Â§ 601â7, a judge whose
disqualification is sought must take the facts alleged
as true, but can pass upon whether they are legally
sufficient. . . . The reasons and facts for the
 belief the affiant entertains must give fair support
to the charge of a bent of mind that may prevent or
impede impartiality of judgment. . . .
 
Bias cannot be premised on adverse rulings
alone.
 
Arquette v. State, 128 Hawai 'i 423, 447-48, 290 P.3d 493, 517-18 
(2012) (citations, internal quotation marks, brackets, and
 
ellipsis omitted). 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying the Teisinas' motion to disqualify Judge Nishimura
 because their allegations that she consistently ruled adversely

 
to them were insufficient to establish bias. Id.
 
III. The circuit court's denial of Lesieli's two motions to
 
dismiss did not constitute reversible error.

 
The Teisinas contend that the circuit court erred when
 
it denied Lesieli's (1) January 5, 2011 motion to dismiss in its
 March 22, 2011 Order because Lambert did not pay $750 to
 Penisimani before commencing this second partition action in
 violation of McKenna's Order; and (2) January 11, 2011 motion to
 dismiss in its March 22, 2011 Order because Penisimani was an
 indispensable party.
A. The circuit court did not err in denying Lesieli's
January 5, 2011 motion to dismiss because Lambert did not
name Penisimani in his complaint.
 
McKenna's Order required the Lambert trustee to pay
 
$750 for Penisimani's "attorneys fees and costs as a precondition
 
to filing a subsequent quiet title and partition action against
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
them concerning the Subject Property." In bringing the instant
case, Lambert did not name Penisimani as a defendant because
 Lambert believed that Penisimani conveyed his interest in Parcel
 33. McKenna's Order did not bar Lambert from filing his quiet
 title and partition action in the instant case because it was not
 filed against Penisimani. The circuit court did not err by
 refusing to dismiss the case on the basis of Lambert's alleged
 noncompliance with Judge McKenna's order.

 
B. The circuit court did not err in denying Lesieli's
January 11, 2011 motion to dismiss because the remedy for
failure to join a necessary party is joinder, not dismissal.
 
The circuit court did not err in denying Lesieli's
 
January 11, 2011 motion to dismiss because dismissal was not the
 
proper remedy for Lambert's failure to name Penisimani in his
 complaint.  HRCP Rule 19 provides:
 
Rule 19. JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDUCATION.
 
(a)
 Persons to be joined if feasible. A person who is
subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in
the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief
cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the
person claims an interest relating to the subject of the
action and is so situated that the disposition of the action
in the person's absence may (A) as a practical matter impair
or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or
(B) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a
substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise
inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order
that the person be made a party. If the person should join
as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made
a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff.
 
(b) Determination by Court Whenever Joinder Not
Feasible. If a person as described in subdivision
(a)(1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court
shall determine whether in equity and good conscience
the action should proceed among the parties before it,
or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus
regarded as indispensable. The factors to be
 considered by the court include: first, to what extent
a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be
prejudicial to the person or those already parties;
second, the extent to which, by protective provisions
in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other
measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided;
third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's
absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the
plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action
is dismissed for nonjoinder.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRCP Rule 19 
is divided into two sections, and . . . typically follows
two steps. . . . First, the court must determine whether an
absent party should be joined if feasible according to the
factors listed in subsection (a). Second, if the party
meets the requirements under subsection (a) but it is not
feasible to join the party to the lawsuit, the court must
proceed to [HRCP] Rule 19(b) to determine whether it may
decide the case without the nonparty. If the court must
 dismiss the lawsuit rather than moving forward without the
absent party, the nonparty is labeled "indispensable."
 
Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai 'i 490, 499, 280 P.3d 88, 97 (2012) 
(footnotes and internal citations omitted).
 
Penisimani was a "person to be joined if feasible"
under HRCP Rule 19(a). Because the circuit court did not order
 
he be joined, it did not determine whether or not it was feasible
 
3
to join him under step one as set forth by HRCP Rule 19(a),  and
therefore could not determine indispensibility under step two as
 set forth by HRCP Rule 19(b). Marvin, 127 Hawai
'i at 499, 280 
P.3d at 97. The circuit court did not err in denying Lesieli's
 motion to dismiss because Penisimani was not an indispensable
 party.
 
 
With regard to the circuit court's denial of Lesieli's
 
motion for reconsideration of her two motions to dismiss in its

 
May 4, 2011 Order, the court did not abuse its discretion because
 Lesieli presented no "new evidence and/or arguments that could
 not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated
 motion[s]." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea
 
Elua Resort Co., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002).
IV.	 The circuit court erred in granting Lambert's motions for
summary judgment.
 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
 
3
 Because Penisimani became an intervenor at a later stage in the
litigation, we conclude that it was feasible to join her prior to ruling on
summary judgment.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.

236 (2004)). 
A. The circuit court erred in granting Lambert's "Motion
for Summary Judgment Regarding Partition and Title [to
Parcel 33]" filed January 3, 2011 (Lambert's First MSJ)
because Lesieli's interest in Parcel 33 was a genuine issue
of material fact.
 
The Teisinas contend that the circuit court erred in
 
granting Lambert's First MSJ in its June 20, 2011 Order and
 
"Motion: (1) For Summary Judgment Against [Penisimani]; (2) For
 Determination of Interests, If Any, of [the Teisinas] in House on
 Parcel 33; and (3) For Dissolution of the Court's Stay Entered
 August 24, 2011" filed September 30, 2011 (Lambert's Second MSJ)
 
in its November 23, 2011 Order because (1) a quitclaim deed from
 
Peter Lua to the Teisinas (Lua quitclaim deed) conveyed a 10,000
 
square foot portion of Parcel 33 to the Teisinas "as tenants by
 
the entirety as husband and wife," and (2) the Teisinas gained
 ownership of Parcel 33 by adverse possession. Lambert argues
 that the circuit court did not err in granting his motions for
 summary judgment because the Teisinas did not establish adverse
 possession.
 
Quiet title and partition is appropriate only when the 
plaintiff-movant establishes that his title is superior to that of the defendant. See Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. v. Silva, 124 
Hawai
'i 476, 482, 248 P.3d 1207, 1213 (App. 2011) (holding that 
when both parties put forth evidence of title, the court must determine "which party has title superior to that of the other party" because a defendant's superior title prevents the plaintiff from quieting title) (citing Harrison v. Davis, 22 Haw. 465, 466 (Haw. Terr. 1915)). In addition to establishing superior title, the plaintiff-movant must also show "that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant-claimant's interest[.]" Alexander & Baldwin, at 485,
 
248 P.3d at 1216.
 
In the instant case, the parties do not dispute that
 
Lambert has superior title, but they do dispute Lesieli's
 interest in Parcel 33. 
Lambert's First MSJ argued that the "Consolidation, CoÂ­
4
Tenancy and Subdivision Agreement"(Co-Tenancy Agreement),  which
was entered into by Lambert's mother, Elizabeth, and Lua on April
 
18, 1986, was void due to fraud on the part of Lua and therefore

 
Lua owned "only a 3/2912 interest in Parcel 33, which calculates
 to approximately 103.9 square feet" and Lesieli had a 3/5824
 interest in Parcel 33 rather than title to a 10,000 square foot
 portion of Parcel 33. Lambert's First MSJ included a Certificate
 of Title stating that Lua inherited his interest in Parcel 33
 from his father in 1986 and conveyed a 10,000 square foot portion
 of Parcel 33 to the Teisinas in 1991. Lambert's First MSJ also
 
included Lambert's declaration that the Co-Tenancy Agreement was
 induced by fraud on the part of Lua and therefore void.
 
In her opposition to Lambert's First MSJ, Lesieli
 
contended, inter alia, that the parties disputed "the footage

 
amount and title of property ownership belonging to [Lesieli]"
 and whether Lesieli owned her portion of Parcel 33 through
 adverse possession. Lesieli argued that she and Penisimani
 "purchased the 10,000 [square foot portion] of Parcel 33 in 1991
 as husband and wife, joint tenants[,]" and acquired the property
 by adverse possession because she and Penisimani had "been in
 open, exclusive, continuous, hostile and notorious possession of
 the property since 1991[.]" Lesieli supported her opposition
 with a copy of the Lua quitclaim deed.
 
4
 The Co-Tenancy Agreement provided that Elizabeth P. Lambert
(Elizabeth) owned 43% (0.856 acres) and Peter K. Lua, Sr. (Lua) owned 57%
(1.144 acres) of Parcel 33 as cotenants. The Co-Tenancy Agreement further
provided that a surveyor determined Parcel 33 to consist in 2.565 acres and
therefore agreed to divide their ownership of the surveyed land according to
their co-tenancy interests; "therefore [Elizabeth's] portion shall be equal to
1.103 acres (43% of 2.565 acres) and [Lua's] portion shall be equal to 1.462
acres (57% of 2.565 acres)."
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In its June 20, 2011 Order granting Lambert's First
 
MSJ, the circuit court concluded that Lambert had a "6769/10976"
 
undivided interest in Parcel 33 and that Lesieli had a "3/5824"
 undivided interest in Parcel 33. The circuit court also
 concluded that the Co-Tenancy Agreement was void and therefore
 had no effect on the conveyance of Parcel 33.
 
Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to 
Lesieli, we hold that the circuit court erred in granting Lambert's First MSJ because Lesieli's interest in Parcel 33 was a genuine issue of material fact. Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, 119 Hawai
'i 
at 96, 194 P.3d at 537. Whether Lesieli has title to 10,000 square feet of Parcel 33 or a 3/5824 interest in Parcel 33 was an issue of fact to be determined at trial, not on summary judgment. 
We also hold that Lesieli's argument that she acquired
 
the 10,000 square foot portion of Parcel 33 by adverse possession
 is without merit because she has not established possession for
 the required twenty-year period. See HRS Â§ 669-1(b) (1993)
 
(providing that an action to establish "title to a parcel of real
 property of five acres or less may be brought by any person who
 has been in adverse possession of the real property for not less
 than twenty years"). Lesieli alleged that she lived on the
 property since 1991 and the Complaint was filed in 2009.
 
We also hold that the circuit court also erred in
 
ruling on Lambert's First MSJ because Penisimani was not yet a
 party to the suit, was a person to be joined if feasible under
 HRCP Rule 19(a), and the circuit court had not ordered he be
 joined. Disposition of the issue of whether Penisimani had any
 interest in Parcel 33 was necessary to determine Lesieli's
 interest in Parcel 33 because Lesieli claimed that she and
 Penisimani acquired a 10,000 square foot portion of Parcel 33 as
 tenants in common, husband and wife, through the Lua quitclaim
 deed. Because Penisimani was not a party when the circuit court
 ruled on Lambert's First MSJ, he did not have the opportunity to
 protect his alleged interest in Parcel 33. Under HRCP Rule
 19(a), the circuit court should have ordered Lambert to join
 Penisimani as a party. This error, however, was harmless because
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Penisimani subsequently intervened and represented his alleged
 
interest in Parcel 33 while opposing Lambert's Second MSJ.
 
We therefore vacate the portion of the circuit court's
 
June 20, 2011 Order that ruled on Lesieli's interest in Parcel
 33. The remainder of the circuit court's June 20, 2011 Order is
 affirmed.
 
B. The circuit court erred in granting Lambert's Second
MSJ because Penisimani's interest in Parcel 33 was a genuine
issue of material fact.
 
In his Second MSJ, Lambert contended that Penisimani
 
conveyed all of his interest in Parcel 33 "to Etuate Sinilau Fa
 
aka Edward Sinilau Fa and Joelene Noelani Cazimero Fa" (the Fas)
 
when he attempted to convey 0.023 acres (1,001.88 square feet) by
 
quitclaim deed recorded on March 21, 1997 (Fa quitclaim deed)
 
because pursuant to the circuit court's June 20, 2011 Order,
 
Penisimani only owned 51.95 square feet. In his opposition to
 Lambert's Second MSJ, Penisimani contended that he owned 10,000
 square feet of Parcel 33 as tenants by the entirety with Lesieli. 
In support of his opposition, Penisimani filed his October 12,
 2011 declaration, the August 31, 2011 affidavit of Peter Lua, and
 other supporting declarations and exhibits. In its November 23,
 2011 Order, the circuit court ruled that Penisimani "has no title
 or interest in [Parcel 33]." At the October 25, 2011 hearing on
 Lambert's Second MSJ, the circuit court stated that Lua's
 declaration that he sold Parcel 33 to the Teisinas as husband and
 wife would not "change the court's mind regarding what was his
 intent because . . . it doesn't say tenants by the entirety on
 the deed itself." The circuit court further stated that Lua's
 declaration was not admissible evidence by which the Teisinas
 could "raise a genuine issue of material fact as to title."
 
Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to 
Penisimani, we hold that the circuit court erred in granting Lambert's Second MSJ because Penisimani's interest in Parcel 33 was a genuine issue of material fact. Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, 119 
Hawai
'i at 96, 194 P.3d at 537. In other words, the parties 
dispute whether Penisimani and Lesieli acquired a 10,000 square 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
foot portion or a 103.9 square foot portion of Parcel 33 and this
 
disputed fact is material to the determination of Penisimani's
 current interest, if any, in Parcel 33. Penisimani's interest in
 Parcel 33 was an issue of fact to be determined at trial, not on
 summary judgment.
 
We therefore vacate the portion of the circuit court's
 
November 23, 2011 Order that ruled on Penisimani's interest in
 Parcel 33. The remainder of the circuit court's November 23,
 2011 Order is affirmed.
 
V.	 The Teisinas fail to present discernable arguments with
regard to their contentions that the circuit court erred (1)
in the timing and amount of its enhancement value
determination and (2) by not having a jury determine title
and enhancement value.
 
The Teisinas contend that the circuit court erred in
 
ordering the sale of Parcel 33 before determining the enhancement
 
value of the house built by them on Parcel 33. The Teisinas also
 contend that the circuit court erred in assessing an enhancement
 value of only $150,000 because the house allegedly had an
 appraised value of $393,000 and the Teisinas allegedly spent at
 least $350,000 building the house. The Teisinas provide no
 support for these contentions.
 
The Teisinas also contend that the circuit court erred 
in denying their motion to vacate its November 23, 2011 Order in its February 23, 2012 Order, and their motion for stay pending appeal in its May 3, 2012 Order Denying Motion for Stay. The Teisinas contend they were entitled to have a jury determine (1) title to the 10,000 square foot portion of Parcel 33, and (2) the enhancement value for Parcel 33 resulting from the Teisinas' house and improvements. To support this contention, the Teisinas cite HRS Â§ 668-8 (1993), the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution, and section 13 of the Hawai
'i Constitution. 
Lambert argues that the Teisinas waived their right to a jury trial by not demanding a jury trial. 
The Teisinas' contentions are not supported by 
discernable arguments and therefore deemed waived. Int'l Sav. 
and Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai
'i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
454, 463 (App. 2000) ("An appellate court need not address 
matters as to which the appellant has failed to present a discernible argument."); Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7)&(8) (providing that the appellant's opening brief must include reasons for the appellant's contentions, cite authorities in support of the reasons, and quote the authorities when appropriate).
VI.	 The circuit court's attorneys' fees and costs determinations
relative to the parties' interests in Parcel 33 were
dependent on its erroneous grants of summary judgment.
 
The Teisinas argue that the circuit court erred in
 
awarding Lambert $58,479.13 in attorneys' fees and costs and
 
deducting that amount from the Teisinas' enhancement value award
 because Lambert "owns about 61.67% of [Parcel 33 and the
 Kuleana], so he should pay his own share of his own attorneys'
 fees and costs." The Teisinas also argue that the circuit court
 erred in refusing "to award the Teisinas their requested
 attorney's fees and costs of about $26,296" "on the enhancement
 issue per HRS Â§ 668-17 [(1993])."
 
In partition cases, costs are generally "apportioned
 
between the parties according to their respective interests"
 because "all parties to the suit are presumed to be
 proportionately benefited [sic] by all of the steps in which
 costs are incurred." Lalakea v. Laupahoehoe Sugar Co., 35 Haw.
 
262, 298 (Haw. Terr. 1939). "HRS Â§ 668-17 applies to attorney's
 fees and costs incurred pursuant to a quiet title action which is
 necessary to the accomplishment of a partition proceeding." 
Kealamakia v. Heirs of Kamoehalau, 68 Haw. 429, 430, 717 P.2d
 516, 518 (1986). HRS Â§ 668-17 provides, in pertinent part:
 
Â§668-17 Costs.  All costs of the proceedings in
partition shall be paid by the plaintiff in the first
instance, but eventually by all of the parties in proportion
to their interests[.] . . . In addition to costs of the
 proceeding the judge may allow any fee or fees for legal
services rendered by the attorneys for any of the parties,
and apportion the same for costs for payment by and between
the parties or any of them, all as to the judge shall seem
equitable in the light of the services performed and the
benefits derived therefrom by the parties, respectively. 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court's Confirmation Order incorporated by
 
reference its June 20, 2011 Order and its November 23, 2011
 
Order. The circuit court concluded that 
13. Given that the Court has found that the
 
Teisinas' house is worth $150,000.00 of the confirmed
$425,000.00 purchase price of Parcel 33 (i.e., approximately
35% of the purchase price), it is appropriate that the
Teisinas' house bear 150/425ths of the fees and costs
incurred in this partition as attributed to Parcel 33 and
that the land comprising Parcel 33 bear 275/425ths of the
fees and costs incurred in this partition as attributed to
Parcel 33.
 
The circuit court ordered the Teisinas to pay
 
$58,479.13 in attorneys' fees and costs relative to their
 
$150,000 enhancement value award, and Lambert to pay $66,118.46
 and Lesieli to pay $55.23 in attorneys' fees and costs relative
 to their interests in Parcel 33. Accordingly, the circuit court
 did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees and
 costs because it based its determinations on the parties
 respective interests in Parcel 33. However, because the circuit
 court's June 20, 2011 Order and November 23, 2011 Order are
 vacated in part on account of the Teisinas' interests in Parcel
 33 equating to genuine issues of material fact, the Confirmation
 Order must also be vacated in part with regard to the attorneys'
 fees and costs determinations that relied on the court's
 determination of the parties' respective interests in Parcel 33.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following orders of the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed:
