IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
SHIRLEY PICO, AS TRUSTEE, for the SHIRLEY PICO FAMILY TRUST dated
August 31, 2004, and SHIRLEY PICO, in her individual capacity,
Plaintiff-Appellant, v. RAFAEL D. BANIAGA, MANUEL D. TABAQUIN;
INFINITY MORTGAGE, and JOHN DOES 1-100, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0576-03)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
do not have jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-
Appellant Shirley Pico, as Trustee for the Shirley Pico Family
 Trust Dated August 31, 2004, and Shirley Pico, in her individual
 capacity (Appellant Pico) has asserted from the Honorable Karen
 T.
 Nakasone's February 26, 2013 judgment, because the 
February 26, 2013 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013), Rules 54(b) and 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994).  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate
 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . .
 provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58
 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate
 document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced
 to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and
 against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it
 resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been
 reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119
 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP
 Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if 
the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (some emphasis 
added). The finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b) is "an express determination that there is no just reason for delay . . . for the entry of judgment" as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties. HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, when a party seeks appellate review of an order that adjudicates one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties, the "party cannot appeal from [the] circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer 
v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai
'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 
(1994) (emphases added). 
The circuit court has not entered a judgment in this
 
case that satisfies the requirements for appealability. Although
 the circuit court entered the February 26, 2013 judgment in favor
 of Defendants-Appellees Manuel T. Tabaquin and Rafael D. Baniaga
 and against Appellant Pico as to all claims in Appellant Pico's
 second amended complaint, the February 26, 2013 judgment neither
 enters judgment on nor dismisses Appellant Pico's claims as to
 Defendant-Appellee Infinity Mortgage, which remain unresolved. 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Although the February 26, 2013 judgment does not resolve all
 
claims against all parties, the February 26, 2013 judgment also
 does not contain an express finding of no just reason for delay
 in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all
 claims or parties, as HRAP Rule 54(b) requires under the holdings
 in Jenkins and Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co. Accordingly,
 
the February 26, 2013 judgment does not satisfy the requirements
 for an appealable judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b),
 HRCP Rule 58, and the holdings in Jenkins and Oppenheimer v. AIG
 Hawaii Ins. Co. Absent an appealable final judgment in this
 
case, Appellant Pico's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001027. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-12-0001027 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
