APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-1287-06)
 
ORDER
 
(1) GRANTING THE OCTOBER 24, 2013
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
AND
 
(2) GRANTING THE OCTOBER 16, 2013
MOTION TO DISMISS CONSOLIDATED APPEALS
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
  
Upon consideration of (1) the October 24, 2013 request
 
for judicial notice (Docket 93), (2) the October 16, 2013 motion
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to dismiss consolidated appeals (Motion to Dismiss) (Docket 75), 
both of which were filed by Plaintiff-Appellee Central Pacific 
1
Bank (CPB), the papers in support and in opposition,  and the
record, it appears as follows.
 
(1) In this consolidated appeal related to a
 
foreclosure action, CPB moves for judicial notice of the
 commissioner’s deed that conveyed the foreclosed property to a
 third-party purchaser after confirmation of the sale, and timely
 
2
moves for dismissal of the consolidated appeals  because the
instant consolidated appeal from the judgment of foreclosure and
 the judgment on the order confirming sale is moot because no
 relief can be granted and no adverse interest exists where the
 foreclosed property has been sold to a bona fide third-party
 purchaser for value, where no timely supersedeas bond was posted,
 no issue as to jurisdiction of the circuit court to enter said
 judgments exists, and no exceptions to mootness apply.
 
(2) Defendant-Appellants Aikona Maui Properties, LLC
 
(Aikona) and MGM Partnership (MGM), in their memorandum in
 opposition to the Motion to Dismiss (Opposition) and in the
 opening brief, assert that the circuit lacked jurisdiction to
 enter the judgments of foreclosure and confirmation of sale, and
 additionally argue in their Opposition that exceptions to
 mootness apply.
 
1
 Rule 27 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure does not provide
for the filing of a reply memorandum. Consequently, the October 25, 2013
reply filed by CPB was not considered. 
2
 Although the Motion to Dismiss was filed after the opening brief, it
appears that review of the points of error contained in the Opening Brief were
necessary for CPB to determine whether such points would be moot upon said
conveyance of the subject property after confirmation of sale.

(3) Judicial notice of the Commissioner’s Deed 
recorded in land court is appropriate and consistent with Rule 
201 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Evidence. 
(4) This court has no jurisdiction to decide moot 
cases in a case where our decision "could not be carried into effect, or that relief was impossible to grant." Lathrop v. 
Sakatani, 111 Hawai
'i 307, 312, 141 P.3d 480, 485 (Hawai 'i,2006), 
quoting TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai 'i 243, 265, 
990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) and Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawai
'i, 62 Haw. 391, 394-95, 616 P.2d 201, 204 (1980). The 
circumstances that keep the suit alive--adverse interest and effective remedy--must remain for justiciability. Wong, 62 Haw. 
at 394, 616 P.2d 201, 203-04. 
Aikona and MGM do not contest that the subject property
 
in this case was sold to a bona fide third-party buyer for value
 without a stay or timely posting of a supersedeas bond. A
 protective rule exists in such circumstances that the interest of
 the third-party buyer cannot be affected. City Bank v. Saje
 
Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. 130, 133, 748 P.2d 812, 814 (1988);
 Lathrop v. Sakatani, [111] Haw. 307, 314, 141 P.3d 480, 587
 (2996). Although Aikona and MGM argue in the Opposition that the
 circuit court erred in denying their motion to set a bond, the
 record reflects that the motion was denied as untimely, because
 it was filed after the property had been sold; Aikona and MGM did
 not otherwise seek a stay pending appeal; and Aikona and MGM do
 not raise or argue the circuit court’s denial of the motion to
 set bond in the opening brief as a point of error.

This court in City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw.
 
App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 814, explained that an exception to the
 
rule that the right of a good faith purchaser to receive property
 acquired at a judicial sale cannot be affected by the reversal of
 an order ratifying the sale where a [supersedeas] bond has not
 been filed" is "where the reversal is based on jurisdictional
 grounds." Aikona and MGM assert in the Opposition and in the
 Opening Brief that the circuit court of the First Circuit had no
 jurisdiction to adjudicate the foreclosure matter, because the
 proceeding actually was a quiet title proceeding that could only
 have been brought in the Second Circuit, where the property was
 located. The circuit court of the First Circuit is a court of
 general jurisdiction that possesses jurisdiction over civil
 foreclosure actions and quiet title actions. See
 
HRS §§ 603-21.5, 603-21.7. The court in Alamida v. Wilson, 53,
 Haw. 398, 401, 495 P.2d 585, 588 (1972) (citing Kaui v. Kauai
 County, 47 Haw. 271, 386 P.2d 880 (1963), stated:
 
Limitations which localize actions within a given judicial
circuit or division are venue requirements. Since venue
requirements are based upon concepts which are unrelated to
judicial power, requirements of venue may be waived.
 
The Alamida court, 53 Haw. 398, 400, 495 P.2d 585, 587 88 
(brackets added) also stated that Kaui
 
correctly held that the statutory language of HRS § 603­
36(9) [now HRS § 603-36(5)] pertains not to jurisdiction but
to venue. The two concepts should not be confused. The
requirements of jurisdiction are grounded in the state's
inherent judicial power while requirements of venue are
grounded in convenience to litigants.
 
The arguments of Aikona and MGM relate to venue rather than
 
jurisdiction. As such, the jurisdictional exception to the
 protective rule does not apply, and the appeal appears to be
 moot.
 
-4­  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Three recognized exceptions to the mootness doctrine
 
exist: (1) capable of repetition, yet evading review (CRER);
 
(2) public interest; and (3) collateral consequences. Hamilton 
ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai 'i 1, 5-10, 193 P.3d 839, 843­
48 (2008). The CRER exception does not appear to apply here, where the case would not have evaded review had Aikona and MGM timely acted to obtain and post a supersedeas bond or to otherwise obtain a stay of appeal. See City Bank v. Abad Artemio 
M. Abad Revocable Trust Gloria P. Abad Revocable Trust,
 No. 27953, 2009 WL 5084083, 5 (App. Dec. 28, 2009) (“[t]he CRER
 exception to the mootness doctrine does not appear to apply to
 the instant case because the instant case would not evade review
 but for the fact that the Abad Defendants chose not to file a
 supersedeas bond”). The public interest exception does not
 appear to apply where the issue of circuit court jurisdiction
 over an alleged quiet title action based on an allegations that
 effective lease among private parties is in higher priority than
 the mortgage being foreclosed arises out of a private contract
 between parties that does not involve the government, an
 
3
authoritative determination as to jurisdiction  of the circuit
courts already exists in statutes, and recurrence would likely
 occur only if an appellant in this situation fails to obtain a
 supersedeas bond or stay of the appeal. The collateral
 consequences exception does not appear to apply where mootness
 could have been avoided by timely posting of a supersedeas bond
 or otherwise obtaining a stay pending appeal. Therefore,
 
3
 The issue of circuit court jurisdiction, and not venue, is the only
issue raised as a point of error on appeal.
