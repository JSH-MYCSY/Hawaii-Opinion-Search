APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1SS12-1-01192)
 
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 22, 2013 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee John N.
 
Spadaro's (Appellee Spadaro) April 22, 2013 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001035 (motion to dismiss),
 (2) Petitioner-Appellant Teresa J. Moore’s April 29, 2013
 memorandum in opposition to Appellee Spadaro’s April 22, 2013
 motion to dismiss, and (3) the record, it appears that we do not
 have jurisdiction over the appeal that Appellant Moore has
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
asserted from a November 16, 2012 entry in the district court 
minutes that appears to reflect the Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes's oral announcement that she intends to dismiss Appellant Moore's November 14, 2012 petition for a temporary restraining order and Petitioner-Appellee Russell Jack Grisham's (Appellee Grisham) October 30, 2012 petition for a temporary restraining order, because the district court has not yet entered an appealable written order or appealable written judgment that resolves all of the claims in this district court case. 
We note that in Appellee Spadaro's April 22, 2013
 
motion to dismiss, Appellee Spadaro argues that we should dismiss
 appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001035 because, according to
 Appellee Spadaro, the district court lacked jurisdiction over
 this matter. However, (1) the jurisdiction of the district court
 under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-5 (Supp. 2012) and
 (2) the jurisdiction of the intermediate court of appeals under HRS § 641-1(a) are separate issues. If an aggrieved party timely appeals from a district court order or judgment that is appealable under HRS § 641-1(a), the intermediate court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction, even if the district court lacked jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5 to enter that order or judgment. As the supreme court has explained, when a party asserts a timely appeal from an appealable order or appealable judgment that a trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter, "the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the [trial court's] error[, if any,] in jurisdiction." Koga Engineering v. State, 122 Hawai
'i 60, 84, 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
222 P.3d 979, 1003 (2010) (citation, internal quotation marks and
 
brackets omitted). Therefore, Appellee Spadaro's argument in
 support of dismissing appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001035
 lacks merit.
 
Nevertheless, our review of the record shows that the
 
dismissal of appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001035 is
 warranted because the district court has not yet entered an order
 or judgment that is appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals
are allowed in civil matters from all final
 
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and
district courts. In district court cases, a
judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending
the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . When a written judgment,
order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all
parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is
final and appealable.

1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure provides that "[a] judgment or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." A district court's "oral decision is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 
(2005). Although court minutes might reflect a court's oral announcement of a ruling, "a minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 
319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis added). "In civil cases before the district court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and the judgment is not effective before such entry." KNG Corp.
 
v. Kim, 107 Hawai 'i at 77, 110 P.3d at 401 (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted); cf State v. Bohannon, 102 
Hawai'i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003) ("Accordingly, we hold 
that, in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."). 
On January 22, 2013, the record on appeal for appellate
 
court case number CAAP-12-0001035 was filed, at which time the
 record on appeal did not contain any written order or written
 judgment that ended this case by finally adjudicating Appellant
 Moore's November 14, 2012 petition for a temporary restraining
 order and Appellee Grisham's October 30, 2012 petition for a
 temporary restraining order. Absent an appealable written order
 or appealable written judgment that adjudicates all claims and
 ends this case, Appellant Moore's appeal is premature and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any
court considering and resolving an appeal or
original action. Appellate courts, upon
determining that they lack jurisdiction shall
not require anything other than a dismissal of
the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case
further. Thus, appellate courts have an
obligation to insure that they have jurisdiction
to hear and determine each case. The lack of
 subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived
by any party at any time. Accordingly, when we
perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal,
we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal.

Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 Hawai 'i 322, 326, 944 P.2d 1265,

64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Spadaro's April 22,
 
2013 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-12­0001035 is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-12­0001035 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. All
 pending motions are denied as moot.
