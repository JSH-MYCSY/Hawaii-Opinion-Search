ANITA GRACE DIAZ, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
SANDRA WHANG AND CRAIG WHANG, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC10-1-6863)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the records, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Anita Grace Diaz from the Order Sanctioning Plaintiff Anita Grace
 Diaz, filed on October 22, 2012 and the Judgment, filed on
 November 9, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit. 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. 
In district
 
court cases
, a judgment includes any order from which
an appeal lies. A final order means an order ending

the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order, or
decree ends the litigation by fully deciding all
rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing
further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or
decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted) (emphases added). 
The October 22, 2012 order sanctioned Appellant $500
 
for her conduct toward counsel for Defendants-Appellees Sandra
 Whang and Craig Whang. It did not resolve Appellant's property
 damage claim against Appellees. 
The November 9, 2012 Judgment also did not resolve
 
Appellant's property damage claim against Appellees. 
In order to be appealable under the collateral order 
doctrine, an appealed order must satisfy all three of the following requirements: "the order must [1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 
966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998)(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (brackets in original). The supreme court has observed that it "must construe the collateral order doctrine narrowly and be parsimonious in its application." Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 
Hawai'i 157, 162, 883 P.2d 78, 83 (1994). An order that 
sanctions a party may be effectively be reviewed on appeal following entry of a final judgment. Id. at 161, 833 P.2d at 82. 
Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
