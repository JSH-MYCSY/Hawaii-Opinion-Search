ANITA GRACE DIAZ, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
SANDRA WHANG AND CRAIG WHANG, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC10-1-6863)
 
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF APPELLANT’S
 
MAY 03, 2013 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the “Motion for Reconsideration
 
of Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction,
 
Filed April 26, 2013", by Plaintiff-Appellant Anita Grace Diaz
 (Appellant), filed on May 3, 2013, Appellant claims that an
 October 22, 2012 Order imposing sanctions upon her satisfied the
 three requirements under the collateral order doctrine. 
She
 
provided no facts or argument to support her claim. The October
 22, 2012 Order noted that her failure to appear at a pretrial

conference caused her case to be dismissed. However, the October
 
22, 2012 Order itself did not dismiss her claims against
 Defendants-Appellees Sandra Whang and Craig Whang. There is no
 order or judgment in the record on appeal that dismissed
 Appellant's case as referenced in the October 22, 2012 Order. In
 addition, the November 9, 2012 judgment that Appellant claims is
 a final appealable judgment states that "JUDGMENT is entered in
 favor of NAKAMOTO & TANAKA and against Plaintiff ANITA GRACE
 DIAZ." It did not dismiss Appellant’s claims against Defendants-
Appellees. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is denied.
