APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
SEPTEMBER 29, 2016
 
FUJISE, PRESIDING JUDGE, REIFURTH, and GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.
 
In the eight criminal cases that are part of this
 
appeal, a bail bond was executed by a bail agent, the defendant
 
failed to appear in court as required under the bond, and a bail
 forfeiture judgment was issued pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014). The primary question in the
 
appeal is whether the notice to the "surety" about the bail
 
2
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
forfeiture judgment, which is required under HRS § 804-51, was
 
satisfied by notice to the bail agent who signed the bail bond,
 or whether the insurance company that conferred power-of-attorney
 on the bail agent to execute the bail bond was the "surety" who
 should have received the notice.
 
Real Party in Interest/Appellant International Fidelity
 
Insurance Company (International Fidelity) filed motions to set
 
aside the bail forfeiture judgments in the eight criminal cases. 
In each case, either Ida Peppers (Peppers) or Linda Del Rio (Del
 
Rio) of Freedom Bail Bonds (FBB), or Charles Fisher (Fisher) of
 
AAA Local Bail Bonds (AAA), executed the bail bond as the
 
"undersigned surety." For each of the bail bonds, International
 
Fidelity had issued a power-of-attorney to either Peppers, Del
 Rio, or Fisher.
1 International Fidelity contends that it is the
 
surety on the bail bonds, and thus the notice given to the bail
 agent in each case regarding the bail forfeiture judgment did not
 satisfy the notice requirements under HRS § 804-51.
 
The Circuit Court for the First Circuit (circuit court)
 
held a consolidated hearing on International Fidelity's motions.
2
 
On October 31, 2012, the circuit court denied the motions by way
 of its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 International Fidelity Insurance Company's Consolidated Motions
 to Set Aside Judgment Entered Against International Fidelity
 Insurance Company" (Order Denying Motions to Set Aside Forfeiture
Judgment).
 
On appeal, International Fidelity contends that the
 
circuit court erred by:
 
(1) concluding that HRS § 804-51 did not require 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) to give International 
1
 Given the circuit court's unchallenged finding that Peppers, Del Rio,
and Fisher were, at all times relevant, registered producers for International
Fidelity, we refer to them collectively as the "bail agents" in these cases. 
See HRS § 431:9N-101 (Supp. 2015). We refer to FBB and AAA collectively as
the "bail bond companies."
2
 The Honorable Richard K. Perkins presided. 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fidelity direct notice of the bail forfeiture judgments;
 
(2) concluding that International Fidelity received the
 
notice required under HRS § 804-51;
 
(3) concluding that there was no violation of
 
International Fidelity's due process rights, and further,
 
violating International Fidelity's due process rights by
 upholding the forfeitures;
 
(4) declining to vacate the bail forfeiture judgments 
pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) or 
HRS § 804-51; 
(5) failing to find good cause to vacate the bail
 
forfeiture judgments; and
 
(6) failing to enter a proper judgment.
 For the reasons discussed below, we affirm. On the
 
primary question presented, we hold in these cases that the bail
 agent was the "surety" and therefore, under HRS § 804-51, notice
 of the bail forfeiture judgment to the bail agent was proper. We
 also do not find merit in the other points of error raised by
 International Fidelity.
I. Background
 
The eight separate criminal cases were consolidated for
 
purposes of this appeal. In each case, International Fidelity
 
conferred power-of-attorney on either Peppers, Del Rio, or
 Fisher, to execute bail bonds. In each case, the circuit court
 declared the bail forfeited and entered a bail forfeiture
 judgment. Notice of each bail forfeiture judgment was given to
 the respective bail agent, either Peppers, Del Rio, or Fisher,
 through their bail bond company. In six of the cases, the bail
 bond company filed a motion to set aside the forfeiture judgment
 and all of these motions were denied. In all eight cases, even
 when the bail bond company had already filed a motion that had
 been denied, International Fidelity filed a motion to set aside
 the bail forfeiture judgment. International Fidelity's motions
 were filed long after the bail agent in each case had received
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
notice of the forfeiture judgment. International Fidelity's
 
motions were also filed more than thirty days after it had
 received a letter in each case from the State of Hawai
'i Judiciary 
regarding the respective bail forfeiture judgment.
 
After the consolidated hearing on International

 
Fidelity's motions, the circuit court entered detailed findings
 of fact (FOF) for each case. None of the circuit court's
 
findings are challenged on appeal, and thus we are bound by the
 
findings. 
Bremer v. Weeks , 104 Hawai 'i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 170 
(2004)("[F]indings of fact that are not challenged on appeal are
 binding on the appellate court.")(citations and ellipses
 omitted).
 
The circuit court's FOFs are as follows:
 
1. In each of the cases outlined below, the bail bond
filed on behalf of the defendant contained the following
language:
 
KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENT: THAT THE UNDERSIGNED 
SURETY, OR SURETIES, AS SURETY, HEREBY UNDERTAKE THAT
THE SAID DEFENDANT WILL APPEAR AND ANSWER ALL CHARGES
 MENTIONED IN WHATEVER COURT IT MAY BE PROSECUTED
 WITHIN THE STATE OF HAWAII, AND WILL AT ALL TIMES BE
AMENABLE TO THE ORDERS AND PROCESS OF THE COURT, AND,
IF CONVICTED, WILL APPEAR FOR JUDGMENT, AND RENDER
SELF IN EXECUTION THEREOF, OR FAILING TO PERFORM
EITHER OF THESE CONDITIONS WILL PAY TO THE STATE OF
 HAWAII, AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 804-51 HAWAII REVISED
STATUTES THE SUM OF ...
 
(emphasis added). Included thereafter was the sum of money
the surety or sureties would pay to the State of Hawaii if
the defendant "failed to perform either of these
conditions." The bonds were signed by either Ida Peppers
("Peppers") or Linda Del Rio ("Del Rio") of Freedom Bail
Bonds ("FBB") or Charles Fisher ("Fisher") of AAA Local Bail
Bonds ("AAA").
 
2. Attached to the bail bond in each of the cases
 
outlined below was a power-of-attorney that read as
follows: [ 3
]
KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that I NTERNATIONAL
 
FIDELITY INSURANCE COMPANY, a corporation duly organized
and existing under the laws of the State of New
Jersey, has constituted and appointed, and does hereby
constitute and appoint, its true and lawful Attorney­
3
 Contrary to the circuit court's FOF 2, the various powers-of-attorney
are not identical but all contained similar language to the language quoted by
the circuit court. In any event, FOF 2 is unchallenged on appeal.

in-Fact, with full power and authority to sign the
company's name and affix its corporate seal to, and
deliver on its behalf as surety, any and all
obligations as herein provided, and the execution of
such obligations in pursuance of these presents shall
be as binding upon the company as fully and to all
intents and purposes as if done by the regularly
elected officers of said company at its home office in
their own proper person; and the said company hereby
ratifies and confirms all and whatsoever its said
 Attorney-in-Fact may lawfully do and perform in the
premises by virtue of these presents. . . . Authority
of such Attorney-in-Fact is limited to the execution
of appearance bonds and cannot be construed to
guarantee defendant's future lawful conduct, adherence
to travel limitation, fines, restitution, payments or
penalties, or any other condition imposed by a court
not specifically related to court appearances. A
 separate Power of Attorney must be attached to each
bond executed.

12. In all but two of the instant cases, either FBB or
AAA filed a motion to set aside the forfeiture judgment
within thirty days of receiving notice. In a majority of
those cases, the motions, though ultimately unsuccessful,
were continued to allow the bond companies more time to
locate the defendants. In at least two instances, in Cr.
Nos. 05-1-2446 and 09-1-0616, [International Fidelity]
benefitted from the court's granting of timely motions to
set aside filed by FBB.
 
13. In none of the cases did [International Fidelity]
file an application or motion for relief from the forfeiture
judgment within thirty days of receipt of notice of the
entry of the judgment by FBB or AAA. 
14. Each letter from the Judiciary to [International
Fidelity] concerning the bail forfeitures at issue in this
proceeding indicates that it is a "Notification of Bail Bond
Forfeiture," states that "judgment has been entered," gives
the date of the judgment and the amount forfeited, the case
name and number, the name of the issuing general agent, and
the policy number matching the power of attorney attached to
the bail bond, and ends with a demand for payment in the
following (or similar) language: 
Our records indicate that payment is due and owing.
If the payment is not immediately received,
appropriate legal action will be taken, including but
not limited to requesting the appropriate Court to
determine sufficiency of the surety and/or referring
the matter to the State of Hawaii's Department of the
Attorney General to commence collection actions. 
15. None of the judgments at issue in these
proceedings have been executed upon. 
16. In none of the cases did [International Fidelity]
file an application or motion for relief from the forfeiture
judgment within thirty days of receiving written notice from
the Judiciary of the entry of the judgment. 
17. At all times relevant herein, Peppers, Del Rio,
and Fisher were registered producers for [International
Fidelity] in the State of Hawaii.
 
18. At all times relevant herein, the contract
between [International Fidelity] (referenced as "the
Company") and Peppers (referenced as "the Retailer")
provided that "the Retailer will send, immediately, notice
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to the Company of any forfeitures declared on any bonds
written by him [sic], since such may affect the Company."
 
19. At all times relevant herein, the contract between
[International Fidelity] and AAA provided that "the Producer
will send immediately, notice to International of any
defaults, forfeitures, or breaches declared on any bonds
written by or on behalf of Producer."
 
(Emphasis added.) 
As noted, in six of the cases, either FBB or AAA filed
 
a motion to set aside the bail forfeiture judgment and those
 
motions were denied. In all eight cases -- either after the bail
 bond company's motion had been denied, or more than thirty days
 had passed after notice to the bail agent and no motion to set
 aside was filed –- the Judiciary sent a letter to International
 Fidelity notifying it of the forfeiture judgment and demanding
 payment. At varying times, but in each case more than thirty
 days after receiving the letter from the Judiciary, International
 Fidelity filed its own motion seeking to set aside the forfeiture
 judgment.
 
In its motions to set aside the forfeiture judgment,
 
International Fidelity argued that it must be provided relief
 from the respective bail forfeiture judgment because it was not
 provided notice under HRS § 804-51, which deprived International
 Fidelity of the opportunity to search for the absconded defendant
 or to file a motion within thirty days as required by § 804-51. 
International Fidelity further asserted that the notice provided
 to the bail bond company could not be imputed to International
 Fidelity, and that the letters from the Judiciary to
 International Fidelity did not constitute notice under HRS
 § 804-51. Finally, International Fidelity asserted that because
 it did not have direct notice of the forfeiture judgments, the
 circuit court lacked jurisdiction to execute on the judgments. 
In the Order Denying the Motions to Set Aside
 
Forfeiture Judgment, in addition to its findings of fact, the
 circuit court issued a number of conclusions of law (COL). COLs
 
7, 8, and 9 are particularly important, stating:
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7. Contrary to [International Fidelity's] assertions,
the legislature intended the term "surety," as used in the
notice provisions of HRS § 804-51, to apply to bondspersons
such as Pepper[s] and Del Rio of FBB and Fisher of AAA. As
 noted by the Senate Judiciary Committee in its report on the
bill that amended § 804-51 to require written notice of bond
forfeitures,
 
[t]he purpose of this bill is to change
the present law by requiring that the
courts give a 
written notice to the bail
bondsman (referred to as the surety in
Chapter 804, Hawaii Revised Statutes) upon
forfeiture of any bail bond. A bail bond
 is forfeited when a criminal defendant
 fails to appear for a scheduled court
appearance. This bill would also allow a
 bail bondsman thirty days, instead of the
present ten, to object to any forfeiture
of a bail bond.
 
Senate Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 857, 1989 Senate Journal at

1127 (emphasis added).
 
8. Thus, under § 804-51, notice need only be given to
the bondsperson to trigger the running of the thirty-day
filing period.
 
9. In each of the instant matters, notice to FBB or
AAA, as the case may be, satisfied the notice requirement of
§ 804-51 and subjected [International Fidelity] to execution
on the bond unless a motion or application showing good
cause why execution should not issue were filed with the
court within the thirty-day period following receipt of
notice by FBB or AAA. While FBB or AAA timely filed motions
to set aside in most of the cases, none were successful as
to the forfeiture judgements at issue in this proceeding.
[International Fidelity] did not, within thirty days of
notice to FBB or AAA, file a motion or application showing
good cause in any of the instant cases.
 
(Emphasis in original and added.) The circuit court thus held
 
that, given International Fidelity's failure to timely file its
 motions to set aside the forfeiture judgments, the court was
 without jurisdiction to consider the motions under 
State v.
 
Ranger Ins. Co. Ex rel. James Lindblad, Inc., 83 Hawai 'i 118, 124 
n.5, 925 P.2d 288, 294 n.5 (1996).5

 In Ranger Ins., the surety filed a motion to set aside a bail 
forfeiture judgment, which was denied, and then subsequently filed a motion to
vacate and to stay execution on the bail forfeiture judgment. 83 Hawai' i at 
120, 925 P.2d at 290. The Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the second motion
did "not provide a legal basis for the relief requested . . . because it wasnot filed within the time limit imposed by HRS § 804-51, and the circuit courtwas therefore without power to consider it." 83 Hawai' i at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d
(continued...)

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addressing International Fidelity's other arguments,
 
the circuit court also concluded, in pertinent part, that: (1)
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 81(a)(8), the HRCP do not apply to bail
 forfeiture proceedings, and thus the court declined to afford
 relief under HRCP Rule 60; (2) even assuming that notice to the
 bail bond companies was not notice to International Fidelity,
 International Fidelity received notice in each case via the
 letter from the Judiciary and failed to file the required motion
 to set aside within thirty days of receiving those letters; and
 (3) International Fidelity's due process rights were not
 violated.
 
International Fidelity timely appealed from the circuit
 
court's Order Denying Motions to Set Aside Forfeiture Judgment.
II. Standards of Review
 
A. Conclusions of Law
 
We review the trial court's conclusions of law de novo
 
under the "right/wrong" standard. Under this ... standard,
we examine the facts and answer the question without being
required to give any weight to the trial court's answer to
it. Thus, a conclusion of law is not binding upon the
appellate court and is freely reviewable for its
correctness. 
State v. Kane, 87 Hawai 'i 71, 74, 951 P.2d 934, 937 (1998) 
(citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted and block 
format altered).
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
Resolving issues presented in this appeal requires the

 
interpretation of relevant statutory provisions.
 
Statutory interpretation is a question of law
reviewable de novo.
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory

interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its
plain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task
of statutory construction is our foremost obligation
 
5(...continued)
at 294 n.5. 
The supreme court further succinctly stated that "HRS § 804-51
permits the filing neither of a second motion seeking to show 'good cause why
execution should not issue' nor any motion after the closing of the thirty-day
window." Id.
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from
the language contained in the statute itself. Fourth,
when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
If the statutory language is ambiguous or doubt exists as to
its meaning, courts may take legislative history into
consideration in construing a statute. We may also consider
legislative history to assist in confirming our
interpretation of a statute.
 
State v. Miles, 135 Hawai 'i 525, 527, 354 P.3d 178, 180 (App.
2015) (citations and quotation marks omitted). 
This court has numerous tools to construe an ambiguous
statute:
 
[T]he meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning. Moreover, the courts may
resort to extrinsic aids in determining legislative
intent. One avenue is the use of legislative history
as an interpretive tool. This court may also consider
the reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which
induced the legislature to enact it to discover its
true meaning. Laws in pari materia, or upon the same
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to
each other. What is clear in one statute may be called
upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.

Specifically, with respect to HRS § 804-51, this court
 
has stated:
 
The construction of Hawai' i's bail bond forfeiture 
scheme, as set forth in Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804­
51 (1993), and in particular, the determination of whether a
principal or a surety under a bail bond may secure relief
from a judgment of forfeiture, involves a question of law
reviewable de novo.
 
However, a lower court's order denying relief from a
judgment of bail bond forfeiture on grounds that a surety
has not, as required by HRS § 804-51, shown good cause why
execution should not issue upon the judgment is reviewed for
abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs where
 the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or
 
15
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.

III. Discussion
 
A. Notice To The "Surety" Under HRS § 804-51
1. Overview
 
International Fidelity contends that it is the "surety"
 
in these cases, and therefore, the circuit court erred in
 
concluding that HRS § 804-51 did not require notice of the bail
 forfeiture judgments be given to International Fidelity. 
International Fidelity argues that FBB and AAA were "bail
 agents," that those working for FBB and AAA were "bondspersons,"
 and that the circuit court's conclusion that the term "surety" in
 HRS § 804-51 equals "bondsperson" produces an absurd result
 because it would invalidate or confuse the safeguards in HRS
 Chapter 804 that assure qualified sureties post bonds, would
 allow a bondsperson without proper qualifications to post bond,
 or would require a bondsperson to meet the same stringent
 qualifications as a surety.
 
The State, in turn, relies on two arguments. First,
 
the State argues that FBB and AAA were the agents of
 International Fidelity and thus notice given to FBB or AAA was
 the equivalent of notice to International Fidelity. In this
 regard, the State relies on the contracts between International
 Fidelity and FBB or AAA, respectively, as well as arguments based
 on principles of agency (i.e., that FBB and AAA had express or
 apparent authority to receive notice for International Fidelity). 
Second, the State contends that the letters sent by the Judiciary
 directly to International Fidelity, providing notification of the
 bail forfeiture judgment and, inter alia, demanding payment of
 the forfeited bonds, constituted sufficient notice under HRS 
§ 804-51.
 
We do not adopt either party's position, but rather
 
agree with the circuit court to the extent it held that the term
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"surety" in HRS § 804-51 refers to the bondspersons (or bail
 
agents) in these cases –- Peppers, Del Rio, and Fisher. Like the
 circuit court, we believe the relevant legislative history for
 HRS § 804-51 clearly supports this interpretation of the statute. 
It is also consistent with HRS § 804-1 (2014), which provides
 that the surety signs on the recognizance or bond. In these
 cases, it is undisputed that either Peppers, Del Rio, or Fisher
 executed the bail bond in each case as "the undersigned surety or
 sureties."
 
Our holding is further confirmed by analyzing relevant
 
provisions in HRS Chapter 804, as well as related provisions in
 HRS Chapter 431 (Insurance Code) pertaining to "bail agents"
 (also referred to as "insurance producers" under the Insurance
 Code). We recognize at the start that the terminology used in
 HRS Chapter 804 and in Chapter 431 are not identical, but
 understandably so, given that these chapters deal with diverse
 and broad subjects. However, a careful reading of the pertinent
 and related statutory provisions in pari materia establish that a
 person or entity can qualify as a "surety" under Chapter 804 in a
 variety of ways, including by satisfying certain requirements in
 Chapter 431. Chapter 804 expressly provides that when an
 "insurance bond" as defined in HRS § 431:1-210(1) (2005) is
 posted as bail (such as in this case), a person may qualify as a
 "surety" by satisfying the requirements of HRS Chapter 431
 Article 9A (Producer Licensing), which addresses "insurance
 producers." See HRS § 804-10.5 (2014); HRS § 431:1-210(1); HRS
 
Chapter 431 Article 9A. As further established under Chapter 431
 Article 9N (Bail Agents; Sureties), a "bail agent" is, inter
 alia, a licensed "insurance producer" under Chapter 431 Article
 9A appointed by an authorized "surety insurer." HRS § 431:9N-101
 (Supp. 2015). Thus, in the context of these cases, Peppers, Del
 Rio, or Fisher was the "surety"/"insurance producer"/"bail agent"
 in each case, whereas International Fidelity was the "surety
 insurer."
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Rather than lead to an absurd result, as argued by
 
International Fidelity, the circuit court's ruling that Peppers,
 
Del Rio, or Fisher, respectively, was the "surety" in each case
 is consistent with statutory provisions adopted in Chapter 804,
 as well as Articles 9A and 9N of Chapter 431, that provide
 safeguards related to insurance bail bonds and that require the
 proper qualification and licensing of sureties in these
 circumstances.
 
2. HRS Chapter 804 and HRS Chapter 431
 
HRS § 804-51, which sets forth the notice requirement
 
at issue in this appeal, states:
 
§804-51 Procedure. Whenever the court, in any
criminal cause, forfeits any bond or recognizance given in a
criminal cause, the court shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the State and against the principal or
principals and surety or sureties on the bond, jointly and
severally, for the full amount of the penalty thereof, and
shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately after the
expiration of thirty days from the date that 
notice is given
via personal service or certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the surety or sureties on the bond, of the
entry of the judgment in favor of the State, unless before
the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given to the surety or sureties on the bond of the entry of
the judgment in favor of the State, a motion or application
of the principal or principals, surety or sureties, or any
of them, showing good cause why execution should not issue
upon the judgment, is filed with the court. If the motion or
application, after a hearing held thereon, is sustained, the
court shall vacate the judgment of forfeiture and, if the
principal surrenders or is surrendered pursuant to section
804-14 or section 804-41, return the bond or recognizance to
the principal or surety, whoever shall have given it, less
the amount of any cost, as established at the hearing,
incurred by the State as a result of the nonappearance of
the principal or other event on the basis of which the court
forfeited the bond or recognizance. If the motion or
application, after a hearing held thereon, is overruled,
execution shall forthwith issue and shall not be stayed
unless the order overruling the motion or application is
appealed from as in the case of a final judgment.
 
This section shall be considered to be set forth in full in words
 and figures in, and to form a part of, and to be included in, each
and every bond or recognizance given in a criminal cause, whether
actually set forth in the bond or recognizance, or not.
 
(Emphasis added.) The plain language of HRS § 804-51 provides
 
that whenever a court forfeits any bond or recognizance, judgment
 must be immediately entered against "the principal or principals

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6  The 1989 amendments to HRS § 804-51 were adopted in Act 289, related
to Senate Bill No. 740.  See 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws, Act 289, § 1 at 643.  The
relevant language of Act 289 originated, however, in Senate Bill No. 1061,
which is the bill referenced in Senate Standing Committee Report No. 857.  The
language of Senate Bill No. 1061, S.D.1 was later incorporated into Senate
Bill No. 740.  See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1285, in 1989 House Journal at
1318.   
19and surety or sureties on the bond" and notice of the forfeiture
judgment must be given to the "surety or sureties on the bond" in
order to trigger the thirty-day wait period before execution can
issue on the bail forfeiture judgment.
As highlighted by the circuit court, when the
Legislature amended HRS § 804-51 in 1989 to require notice to
"the surety or sureties on the bond," the legislative history
indicates the intent was to require notice to the "bail
bondsman," with the Senate Judiciary Committee report noting that
"bail bondsman" is referred to as the "surety" in Chapter 804.
See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 857, in 1989 Senate Journal at 1127.6
To provide further perspective, we quote even more of the report
than was referenced by the circuit court:
The purpose of this bill is to change the present law
by requiring that the courts give a written notice to the
bail bondsman (referred to as the surety
 in Chapter 804,
Hawaii Revised Statutes) upon forfeiture of any bail bond. 
A bail bond is forfeited when a criminal defendant fails to
appear for a scheduled court appearance.  This bill would
also allow a bail bondsman thirty days, instead of the
present ten, to object to any forfeiture of a bail bond.
. . . .
This bill is to address the situation where a bail
bondsman is not informed for some time after the defendant
fails to make a court appearance.  Allegedly, the first
several days are crucial to a bail bondsman's ability to
find a defendant.  Bail bondsmen maintain that if the
information that the defendant has not appeared for court is
obtained immediately, then the bondsman has a good chance of
finding the defendant before he leaves Hawaii.
The present statute allows for a bail bondsman to have
the bail forfeiture set aside, but only within ten days
after the defendant has failed to appear for court.  Bail
bondsmen claim that they are not even informed within this
ten-day period that the defendant has failed to appear for
court.
Id. at 1127-28 (emphasis added).  We agree with the circuit courtFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that this legislative history assists in clarifying the statute,
 
in that it appears the Legislature intended notice to the bail
 bondsman so that, inter alia, the bail bondsman would be in a
 better position to apprehend the defendant who failed to appear
 for court. This legislative history does not reflect an intent
 to provide notice to the insurance company on an insurance bail
 bond or that such an insurance company be considered the "surety"
 under HRS Chapter 804.
 
Moreover, although HRS Chapter 804 does not define the
 
terms "surety" or "sureties," the terms are utilized in other
 sections within Chapter 804 which provide context and guidance
 for our analysis. This includes HRS § 804-1, which provides:
 
§804-1 Bail defined. Bail, or the giving of bail, is
the signing of the recognizance by the defendant and the
defendant's surety or sureties,  conditioned for the
appearance of the defendant at the session of a court of

competent jurisdiction to be named in the condition, and to
abide by the judgment of the court.
[ 7]   
 
(Emphasis added.) Based on HRS § 804-1, the "recognizance" or
 
the bond is signed by the defendant and the "surety or sureties." 
The bail bonds in the instant eight cases were signed by Peppers,
 Del Rio, or Fisher (of either FBB or AAA), and each bond
 indicates a promise to comply with applicable conditions.
 
We also find significant that HRS § 804-10.5 provides
 
the qualifications for a sufficient surety. HRS § 804-10.5
 provides in full:
 
§804-10.5 Sureties; qualification. (a) In determining
the sufficiency of a surety or sureties, the court shall
consider the surety's or sureties':
(1) Character;
 
7 "Recognizance" means "[a] bond or obligation, made in court, by which
a person promises to perform some act or observe some condition, such as toappear when called[.] . . . Most commonly, a recognizance takes the form of abail bond that guarantees an unjailed criminal defendant's return for a court
date[.]" Recognizance, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). For a "bond" 
related to bail, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has quoted the following with
approval: "[a] bond is a contract between the surety and the government
that[,] if the government releases the principal from custody, the surety willundertake that the principal will appear personally at any specified time andplace.... It is thus the surety's responsibility to ensure the principal'sattendance." State v. Camara, 81 Hawai' i 324, 325, 916 P.2d 1225, 1226
(1996)(quoting United States v. Craft, 763 F.2d 402, 404 (11th Cir. 1985)).

(2)	 Reliability;
(3)	 Place of residence; and
(4)	 Financial and employment circumstances.
(b)	 No person shall be sufficient surety who:
(1)	 Has been convicted of perjury for submitting a
false statement under section 804-11.5;
(2)	 Does not satisfy the requirements of section
804-11.5; or
 
(3)	 Does not satisfy the requirements of article 9A,
chapter 431, if posting an insurance bond as
defined in section 431:1-210(1).
 
(Emphasis added.)8 Given HRS § 804-10.5(b), there are different
 
ways in which a person or entity may qualify as a "sufficient
 
surety." One way, is by satisfying the requirements of HRS 
§ 804-11.5 (2014). Another way, and pertinent to this appeal, is
 by satisfying the requirements of HRS Chapter 431 Article 9A when
 posting an insurance bond as defined in HRS § 431:1-210(1).
 
HRS § 431:1-210(1) provides: 
§431:1-210 Surety insurance defined. Surety insurance
includes:
 
(1) Bail bond insurance, which is a guarantee that any
person, in or in connection with any proceedings in any
court, will:
(A)	 Attend in court when required, or
(B)	 Will obey the orders of judgment of the court,
as a condition to the release of the person from
confinement, and the execution of bail bonds for
any such purpose. The making of property or
cash bail does not constitute the transacting of
bail bond insurance.
 
(Emphasis added.) Under HRS § 804-10.5(b) and § 431:1-210(1),
 
the bonds posted in the cases in this appeal constituted
 "insurance bonds" or "bail bond insurance."
 
In order to be a sufficient "surety" under HRS § 804­
10.5(b)(3), one must meet the requirements of Article 9A of the
 Insurance Code. Article 9A "governs qualifications and
 procedures for the licensing of 
insurance producers. " HRS 
§ 431:9A-101 (Supp. 2015) (emphasis added). Article 9A defines
 an "insurance producer" as a "person required to be licensed
 
8
 As further discussed infra at footnote 11, this version of HRS
§ 804-10.5 was adopted as of July 1, 2006. See 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 154,
 
§ 46 at 447. It was therefore in effect by the time the bail bond was
executed in seven of the eight cases in this appeal. Only the bail bond in
the Nelson case, which was filed on October 28, 2005, was posted before this
version of HRS § 804-10.5 came into effect.
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
under the laws of this State to sell, solicit, or negotiate
 
insurance." HRS § 431:9A-102 (2005). The circuit court found,
 and it is uncontested in the instant eight cases, that Peppers,
 Del Rio, and Fisher were registered producers for International
 Fidelity.
9
 
Providing even further clarity, in 2008, the
 
Legislature adopted HRS Chapter 431, Article 9N.10 Therein, HRS 
§ 431:9N-101 (Supp. 2015) provides, in pertinent part:
 
[§431:9N-101] Definitions.  As used in this article:
 
"Bail agent" means a licensed insurance producer under
article 9A who is appointed by an authorized surety insurer,
furnishes bail for compensation in any court in this State,
and has the power of attorney to execute or countersign bail
bonds in connection with judicial proceedings.
 
(Emphasis added.) As noted above, even International Fidelity
 
asserts that FBB and AAA are the "bail agents" in these cases. 
We refine that even further to conclude that, given the circuit
 court's undisputed finding that Peppers, Del Rio, and Fisher were
 registered producers for International Fidelity at all relevant
 times, they are the "bail agents" in these cases. They are a
 specific subset of "insurance producers" under Article 9A who
 sold, solicited, and negotiated bail bond insurance for
 International Fidelity, the "surety insurer." Therefore, under
 HRS § 804-10.5(b)(3) and Chapter 431 Articles 9A and 9N, the
 sureties/insurance producers/bail agents for purposes of the
 cases in this appeal are Peppers, Del Rio, and Fisher,
 
9 It is also relevant that in four of the cases, where the bail bond
was apparently filed after hours, there are certifications in the record in
which Peppers or Del Rio certify, inter alia, that: they are "licensed to
sell, solicit and negotiate surety insurance in this state" (which is language
consistent with HRS § 431:9A-102); they are enclosing documentation showing
their "insurance producer license" and that they are an "agent of a surety
insurer pursuant to HRS 431"; and they are authorized and appointed by the
"surety insurer" named in the power-of-attorney attached to the bond.
10 When initially proposed, what became Article 9N of the Insurance
Code was proposed as part of an amendment to HRS Chapter 804. See S.B. 1961,
 
24th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Haw. 2007).
 
22
 Rather than an absurd result, as argued by
 
International Fidelity, the circuit court's holding that Peppers,
 
Del Rio, and Fisher were the sureties in these cases is
 consistent with the safeguards intended by the Legislature
 related to sureties when an insurance bail bond is posted in a
 criminal case. That is, as provided in Chapter 804 and Articles
 9A and 9N of Chapter 431, bail bond sureties/insurance
 producers/bail agents must be properly licensed, are subject to
 various actions by the Insurance Commissioner, and have specified

respectively.11
 
11 Article 9N of the Insurance Code became effective on July 1, 2008.
See 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 134, § 3 at 352. In seven of the eight cases in
this appeal, Article 9N was already in effect when the bail bond was posted,
the only exception being State v. Nelson. The bail bond was posted in Nelson
 on October 28, 2005. Furthermore, in 2005, HRS § 804-10.5(b)(3) provided that
a sufficient surety was one who met the requirements of "Article 9, chapter
431, if posting an insurance bond as defined in section 431:1-210(1)," and did
not reference Article 9A. See HRS § 804-10.5 (1993). In 2005, Article 9,
Chapter 431 covered "the qualifications and procedures for granting licenses
to all insurance adjusters, independent bill reviewers, and limited service
representatives." HRS § 431:9-101 (2005). It was not until 2006 that HRS 
§ 804-10.5(b)(3) was amended to reference Article 9A. See 2006 Haw. Sess.
 
Laws Act 154, § 46 at 447.
Notwithstanding that Article 9N had not yet been adopted and an
earlier version of HRS § 804-10.5(b)(3) was in place in 2005 -- when the bail
bond was posted in Nelson -- the result remains the same in that case. In
 2005, HRS § 804-1 provided, as it does today, that the "recognizance" or bond
be signed by the defendant and the surety. Peppers signed the bail bond in
Nelson as the undersigned surety. Moreover, Peppers's own certification in
Nelson establishes her role as the insurance producer in Nelson. She executed
 
a certification in that case providing, inter alia, that she is "licensed to
sell, solicit and negotiate surety insurance in this state," she has an
"insurance producer license," she is an "agent of a surety insurer pursuant to
HRS 431," and she is authorized and appointed by the "surety insurer" named in
the power-of-attorney attached to the bond. Peppers, not International
Fidelity, is the surety in Nelson.
12 Our reading of the relevant statutes in HRS Chapter 804, as well as
Chapter 431 Article 9A and 9N, is consistent with Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 46, which provides: 
Rule 46 Bail; Bond
(a) Bail. The right to bail before conviction or uponreview, the form and amount thereof, and the matters ofjustification of sureties, forfeiture of bail, andexoneration of obligors and sureties shall be as provided bylaw. (See Hawai' i Revised Statutes, Chapter 804.)

23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on the above, we conclude that the notice of the
 
bail forfeiture judgment that is required under HRS § 804-51 was

 
properly provided to Peppers, Del Rio, or Fisher, the respective
 
surety in the instant cases. Given the proper notice to the
 surety, the circuit court correctly ruled that the motions filed
 by International Fidelity to set aside the bail forfeiture
 judgments were untimely and that the court lacked authority with
 regard to these motions.
13 Ranger Ins. Co., 83 Hawai 'i at 124 
n.5, 925 P.2d at 294 n.5 ("HRS § 804-51 permits the filing
 neither of a second motion seeking to show 'good cause why
 execution should not issue' nor any motion after the closing of
 the thirty-day window.").
B.	 International Fidelity's Due Process Rights Were Not
Violated
 
International Fidelity claims that it has a property
 
interest protected by due process because the State seeks to
 
collect from it on the bail forfeiture judgments, and that its
 
12(...continued)
(b) Bond. A party seeking release on bail by posting bond
shall submit the bond in a form that substantially complies
with Form J annexed to these rules. If a bail bond is
 secured by insurance, a copy of the bail agent's power of
attorney shall be attached to the bond, and shall be
supported by the affidavit or declaration of the bail agent
authorized to furnish bail for compensation. The declaration
or affidavit shall identify the insurer, provide the agent's
and insurer's license numbers, attest the agent and the
insurer are currently licensed and in good standing with the
Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawai'i, and attest
the agent and the insurer are in compliance with Hawai'i law
governing bail bonds.
 
(Emphasis added.) Subsection (b) was added to the rule and became effective
as of July 1, 2011. Thus, that subsection was not yet in place when the bail
bonds in the instant eight cases were issued. Nonetheless, HRPP Rule 46(b)
supports our reading of the relevant statutes. 
13 Because we hold that the State was only required to provide notice
to Peppers, Del Rio, or Fisher, we need not reach International Fidelity's
challenge to the circuit court's alternative holding, that the letters sent by
the Judiciary to International Fidelity were sufficient notice under HRS
§ 804-51. Likewise, we need not consider International Fidelity's assertion
that the circuit court erred by failing to find good cause to set aside the
bail forfeiture judgments. The circuit court did not reach this issue because
 it correctly determined that International Fidelity's motions were untimely.
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
due process rights were violated because it was not provided with
 
the notice required under HRS § 804-51. International Fidelity
 relies on Klinger v. Kepano, 64 Haw. 4, 635 P.2d 938 (1981). It
 also relies on State v. Rosillo, 645 N.W.2d 735 (Minn. Ct. App.
 2002), a case it contends is analogous to the instant cases.
 
Given its interest in insuring the amounts forfeited 
under the bail bonds, we agree with International Fidelity that it has a property interest protected by due process rights. See 
Brown v. Thompson, 91 Hawai
'i 1, 9, 979 P.2d 586, 594 (1999). 
Given the circumstances, however, we do not agree that its due process rights have been violated. 
To the extent International Fidelity's argument is
 
based on the contention that the notice requirements under HRS
 § 804-51 have not been met, that contention has already been
 rejected. Thus, we consider whether, the requirements under HRS
 § 804-51 having been met, International Fidelity's due process
 rights have been violated.
 
Citing to Klinger, International Fidelity contends that
 
it was entitled to notice "reasonably calculated" to apprise it
 of the bail forfeiture judgment and an opportunity to show cause
 why the forfeitures should not be executed upon. Klinger states,
 
in relevant part:
 
The [United States Supreme Court] noted that due process “at a
minimum ... require(s) that deprivation of life, liberty or
property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for
hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.” [Mullane v. Cent.
Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313]. It then set out the
following general rule:
 
An elementary and fundamental requirement of due
process in any proceeding which is to be accorded
finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all
the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of
the pendency of the action and afford them an
opportunity to present their objections.... The notice
must be of such nature as reasonable to convey the
required information .... (I)f with due regard for the
practicalities and peculiarities of the case these
conditions are reasonably met, the constitutional
requirements are satisfied....
 
But when notice is a person's due, process which is a
mere gesture is not due process. The means employed
must be such as one desirous of actually informing the
 
25
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.
 
Id. at 314-15, 70 S.Ct. at 657 (emphasis added).
 
64 Haw. at 10, 635 P.2d at 942.
 
The circuit court found and the parties do not dispute
 
in these cases that Peppers, Del Rio, and Fisher were "the
 
authorized attorney-in-fact for [International Fidelity]" and
 that they were "registered producers for [International Fidelity]
 in the State of Hawaii." We also note that HRS § 804-51
 specifically provides that its provisions are made a part of
 every bail bond. The statute states that "[t]his section shall
 be considered to be set forth in full in words and figures in,
 and to form a part of, and to be included in, each and every bond
 or recognizance given in a criminal cause, whether actually set
 forth in the bond or recognizance, or not." HRS § 804-51. Under
 these circumstances, therefore, the notice that was provided to
 Peppers, Del Rio, and Fisher –– as required under HRS § 804-51 ––
 was reasonably calculated to apprise International Fidelity of
 the bail forfeiture judgments.
 
We further note that International Fidelity's reliance
 
on Rosillo is misplaced. In that Minnesota case, the defendant
 failed to appear in court, a bail bond was forfeited, the
 defendant was arrested, the bail bond was reinstated, and bail
 was increased. 645 N.W.2d at 737. There was no notice about the
 bail forfeiture provided to either the bail bond company or the
 surety trust company that had issued the bail bond. Id. 
Thereafter, not being aware of what had occurred previously, the
 bail bond company and surety trust company authorized an
 additional bail bond for the defendant. The defendant then
 failed to appear for trial and both bonds were forfeited. Id. at
 
737-38. The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled in these
 circumstances that the applicable court rule, which required
 notice to both appellants, had been violated and that the failure
 to provide notice to the appellants should have been considered
 in their motions to reinstate and discharge the bonds. Id. at
 
26
  
International Fidelity contends that the circuit court
 
erred by holding it was without authority to set aside the bail
 
forfeiture judgments, asserting that the court should have
 granted relief to International Fidelity under HRCP Rule 60(b). 
International Fidelity contends that, pursuant to State v.
 Camara, 81 Hawai
'i 324, 329 n.7, 916 P.2d 1225, 1230 n.7 (1996), 
bail forfeiture proceedings are civil proceedings, and therefore
 the circuit court had discretion to act pursuant to the HRCP.
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
739. Rosillo is thus distinguishable from this case. Here, the
 
required notice under § 804-51 was provided to Peppers, Del Rio,
 or Fisher.
 
Under the circumstances of the instant cases, we

 
conclude that International Fidelity's due process rights were
 not violated.
 
C. HRCP Rule 60(b) Is Not Applicable

 
The circuit court's relevant conclusions are set forth
 
in COLs 1-3.14 In COL 1, the circuit court correctly ruled that
 
15
under HRCP Rule 81(a)(8),  the HRCP are not applicable to bail
forfeiture proceedings. See State v. Vaimili, 131 Hawai 'i 9, 13­
14, 313 P.3d 698, 702-03 (2013); Miles, 135 Hawai 'i at 529, 354 
14
 COLs 1-3 state:
 
1. HRCP Rule 81(a)(8) provides that the HRCP are not
applicable to proceedings for the forfeiture of bonds.
2. While Rule 81(h) permits the court to "direct that
any one or more of these rules, not otherwise applicable to
said proceeding pursuant to this Rule 81, shall be
applicable to said proceeding," in the court's view, under
the circumstances presented in these consolidated motions,
application of the HRCP - and Rule 60(b) in particular - to
the instant bond forfeiture proceedings would not further
"the just, speedy, [or] inexpensive determination" of any of
the cases. See HRCP Rule 1.
 
3.
 The court therefore declines to order the
 
application of any of the HRCP to these consolidated
proceedings.
15 HRCP Rules 81(a)(8) provides that "[e]xcept as expressly otherwise
provided in this Rule 81 or another rule of court, these rules shall not applyto . . . (8) [p]roceedings for the forfeiture of bonds under section 709-51,as the same may be renumbered[.]" "We note that HRS § 709-51, which isreferenced in the rule, was renumbered as HRS § 804-51." Miles, 135 Hawai' i 
at 529 n.9, 354 P.3d at 182 n.9. 
27
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d at 182. Further, the circuit court properly declined to act
 
under HRCP Rule 81(h) to order any civil procedure rule,
 particularly HRCP Rule 60(b), applicable to the instant bail
 forfeiture proceedings.
 
International Fidelity contends that based on the
 
State's failure to provide adequate notice to International
 Fidelity, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enter the bail
 forfeiture judgments against International Fidelity, the
 judgments are thus void, and "it is incumbent upon the court to
 use its inherent power under HRCP Rule 81(h) to authorize the
 application of HRCP Rule 60(b) to overturn" the bail forfeiture
 judgments.
 
First, we have rejected International Fidelity's
 
contentions regarding the adequacy of notice in these cases. 
Second, pursuant to HRS § 804-51, there is no requirement to give
 notice to the surety prior to entry of a bail forfeiture
 judgment, but rather only after it has been entered. Thus, there
 is no question regarding the circuit court's jurisdiction to
 enter the bail forfeiture judgments in these cases. The circuit
 court properly declined to apply HRCP Rule 60(b) or any other
 civil procedure rule.
D. Form of the Bail Forfeiture Judgments
 
International Fidelity contends that the circuit court
 
erred by failing to enter a proper judgment pursuant to Jenkins
 v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994) and State v. Diaz, 128 Hawai 'i 215, 286 P.3d 824 
(2012). 
International Fidelity contends that, because a bail 
forfeiture proceeding is a civil proceeding, the Jenkins rule applies requiring a separate judgment. However, in Vaimili, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court rejected an argument that the requirements 
of Jenkins apply in bail forfeiture proceedings. 131 Hawai 'i at 
18-19, 313 P.3d at 707-08. Instead, the supreme court held that the requirements of HRS § 804-51 govern. Id. at 18, 313 P.3d at 
28
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
707. Pursuant to HRS § 804-51, the circuit court is only
 
required to enter a bail forfeiture judgment once, at the time
 
the court forfeits the bond. Id. at 19, 313 P.3d at 708. 
The bail forfeiture judgments entered in the instant
 
eight cases were "judgments" consistent with HRS § 804-51. All
 of the judgments entered in the eight cases were entitled
 "Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond," and each ordered
 and decreed that the State had the right to recover the full
 amount forfeited under the bail bond from the principal and the
 surety, jointly and severally. This complies with the
 requirement of HRS § 804-51 that when the court forfeits any bail
 bond, "the court shall immediately enter up judgment in favor of
 the State and against the principal or principals and surety or
 sureties on the bond, jointly and severally, for the full amount
 of the penalty thereof[.]"
 
International Fidelity also contends that this court 
should remand the cases back to the circuit court for entry of conforming judgments pursuant to Diaz. However, as recognized by the supreme court in Vaimili, Diaz was a case of "peculiar circumstances" because in Diaz the original bail forfeiture judgment was not included in the record on appeal, therefore, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction over an initial appeal. 131 Hawai
'i at 18-19, 313 P.3d at 707-08. Upon return of the case in 
Diaz to the circuit court, a second forfeiture judgment was entered given that the original judgment was not in the record. Id. at 19, 313 P.3d at 708; Diaz, 128 Hawai
'i at 221, 286 P.3d at 
830. As the court in Vaimili concluded,
 
[n]othing in [Diaz] provides that a defendant or surety is
entitled to a second final judgment that renders a second 
motion to set aside timely. Such a requirement would allow
defendants and sureties to circumvent the thirty-day time
limit in HRS § 804–51. The filing of a second final judgment
in [Diaz] was the result of “the peculiar circumstances” of
the case.

 
131 Hawai 'i at 19, 313 P.3d at 708. Thus, Diaz is distinguishable 
from the instant cases. In each of the underlying eight cases, a 
bail forfeiture judgment was entered and is included in the 
29
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record on appeal.
