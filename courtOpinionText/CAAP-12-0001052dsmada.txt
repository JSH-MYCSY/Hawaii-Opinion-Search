IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MALIA C. MENDIGORIN, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-04967)
 
ORDER DENYING FEBRUARY 14, 2013 MOTION TO REMAND CASE FOR
SENTENCE AND ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.) 
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Malia C. 
Mendigorin's (Appellant Mendigorin) February 14, 2013 motion to 
remand case for sentencing, (2) the lack of any response by 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i to Appellant Mendigorin's 
February 14, 2013 motion to remand case for sentencing, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over
 
Appellant Mendigorin's appeal from the Honorable David W. Lo's
 
November 1, 2012 judgment against Appellant Mendigorin for 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in
 
violation of HRS § 291E-61 (Supp. 2012), because the November 1,
 
2012 judgment is not an appealable final decision or judgment
 
under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12 (Supp. 2012).

"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The intermediate court of appeals has 
jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or 
agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) 
(Supp. 2012). HRS § 641-12 provides that "[a]ppeals upon the 
record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final 
judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." It 
appears that the November 1, 2012 judgment is neither a final 
decision nor a final judgment because the sentencing has not 
taken place. We have previously held that a district court 
judgment is not final and appealable unless the sentence is 
final: 
Judgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence. In the
 instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay restitution. The court did
 not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount. Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from
the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai' i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005). In the instant case, the November 1, 2012 judgment is not 
final because neither the November 1, 2012 judgment nor any 
subsequent order imposes a sentence against Appellant Mendigorin. 
Consequently, the November 1, 2012 judgment is not an appealable 
final judgment under HRS § 641-12. Absent an appealable final 
judgment in the record on appeal, we cannot exercise appellate 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001052. 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a

court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

P.2d 576, 588 (1995) (citation, internal quotation marks, and 
ellipsis points omitted; emphasis added); Peterson v. Hawaii 
Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 Hawai' i 322, 326, 944 P.2d 1265, 
1269 (1997), superseded on other grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp. 1999); Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai' i 
64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that we deny Appellant
 
Mendigorin's February 14, 2013 motion to remand case for
 sentencing and, instead, we dismiss appellate court case number
 
CAAP-12-0001052 for lack of jurisdiction.
