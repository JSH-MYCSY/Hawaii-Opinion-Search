IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
VICTOR TROMBLEY, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-04664)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Victor Trombley, Jr. (Trombley)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on November 1, 2012 in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).
1
 
The District Court dismissed the charge against
 
Trombley for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 Intoxicant (OVUII), a violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2014), without prejudice.
 
On appeal, Trombley contends the District Court erred
 
by dismissing the charge without prejudice without entry of any
 findings of fact or conclusions of law to justify its decision.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Trombley's point of error as follows:

 The Honorable David W. Lo presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Trombley contends the District Court failed to enter 
findings of fact or conclusions of law after it dismissed the 
charge for a violation of Rule 48 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP). The State contends that the District Court did not dismiss the charge due to a HRPP Rule 48 violation but based the dismissal on the State's inability to proceed. 
Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the
 
District Court dismissed the charge due to a violation of HRPP
 Rule 48.
 
"[I]n determining whether to dismiss a charge with or 
without prejudice under HRPP Rule 48(b), the trial court must not only consider the Estencion factors, but must also clearly articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any other factor it considered in rendering its decision." State v. Hern, 
133 Hawai
'i 59, 64, 323 P.3d 1241, 1246 (App. 2013). "The trial 
court's explanation of its consideration of the Estencion factors and the basis for its decision will permit meaningful appellate review." Id. at 65, 323 P.3d at 1247. However, "Even if the 
trial court's findings are deficient, where the record is sufficient for the appellate court to make a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion, the appellate court may elect, at its option, to resolve the appeal on the merits." Id. The District Court did not articulate the Estencion
 
factors or any other factors it considered when it dismissed the
 charge without prejudice. The record is not sufficient to
 determine whether the District Court abused its discretion by
 dismissing the charge without prejudice.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on November 1,
 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
