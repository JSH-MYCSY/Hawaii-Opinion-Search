SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendants-Appellants William S. Ellis, Jr. (Ellis),
 
appearing pro se, and P.F. Three Partners (PF3) (collectively,
 
"Appellants") appeal from the Amended Final Judgment filed on 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
September 18, 2012, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
Plaintiffs-Appellees Bryan Funai and Cynthia J. Funai
 
(collectively, the "Funais") sued PF3 seeking specific
 performance of PF3's obligation under a Deposit Receipt Offer and
 Acceptance Agreement (DROA) to convey good marketable title to
 Lot 8 in the Olinda Ranch Estates Subdivision (Lot 8) to the
 Funais for $285,000. On December 30, 2008, the Circuit Court
 issued an order granting the Funais' motion for summary judgment
 on their claim for specific performance and ordering PF3 to sell
 Lot 8 to the Funais pursuant to the DROA. PF3 did not comply
 with the December 30, 2008, order. 
In 2009, the Funais discovered that PF3 had not cleared
 
a mortgage encumbering Lot 8 held by Upland Investments Ltd. (the
 "Upland Mortgage"), and that another mortgage, held by the SUS
 
2
Appellees  (the "SUS Mortgage"), had been added to the property
in 2007. 
The SUS Mortgage was created as part of a settlement
 
agreement reached as the result of a lawsuit filed by the SUS
 Appellees (SUS Lawsuit) against PF3, Lindroc Ltd., Ellis, Olinda
 Land Corp. ("Olinda"), Upland Investments Ltd. ("Upland"), Trio
 Produce and Brokerage, Inc., and the Internal Revenue Service. 
The settlement agreement gave the SUS Appellees a mortgage on Lot
 8 superior to the mortgage held by Upland. 
In February 2010, the Circuit Court permitted the

 
Funais to file a Supplemental Complaint adding Ellis, Upland,
 Olinda, Michael A. Roccco, Lindroc Ltd., and the SUS Appellees as
 parties to the Funais' lawsuit to enable the Funais to obtain
 judicial relief against all parties and entities claiming an
 interest in Lot 8. The Amended Final Judgment entered by the
 
1The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided.

 The parties collectively referred to as the "SUS Appellees" are
Defendants-Appellees Barbara A. Sumida, Stanley Unten, Tamae S. Shiraishi, and
Debra Shiraishi-Pratt, in their respective capacities.

Circuit Court on September 18, 2012, provides that pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 70: (1) PF3, Upland, 
and Olinda, and their successors, are divested of all right, title, and interest in Lot 8, including their interest in the 
3
Upland Mortgage;  and (2) the Funais are vested with all right,
title and interest in Lot 8, subject to specified encumbrances,

 
liens, and exceptions, which include the SUS Mortgage. 
II.
 
On appeal, Appellants argue4
 that: (1) the Circuit
Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Lot 8 since

 
November 4, 2010, when the escrow company hired for the
 conveyance of Lot 8 withdrew; (2) HRCP Rule 70 is procedurally
 inapplicable to the Amended Final Judgment; (3) it would be
 impossible to comply with the Circuit Court's December 10, 2008,
 order, which required the specific performance of the DROA within
 sixty days of the order; and (4) the Amended Final Judgment is
 substantively invalid, does not conform to the pleadings, is
 barred by judicial estoppel, and is an invalid mortgage
 foreclosure. We conclude that Appellants' arguments are without
 merit. We resolve the arguments raised by Appellants on appeal
 as follows:
 
(1) Appellants contend that the withdrawal of the
 
escrow company designated to handle the conveyance of Lot 8
 resulted in depriving the Circuit Court of subject matter
 jurisdiction. We disagree. The withdrawal of the escrow company 
had no effect on the Circuit Court's jurisdiction, its order for
 specific performance, or its ability to enforce that order.
 
(2) Appellants contend that the Circuit Court erred in
 
3The record reflects that Upland was a limited partner and Olinda was a
general partner of PF3, and that all these entities were controlled by Ellis.
 
4Ellis filed opening and reply briefs which PF3 adopted and incorporated
by reference without submitting additional arguments. We note that default
 
judgments were entered against Upland and Olinda. Although Ellis purports to
appear as the statutory liquidator for Upland and Olinda, he makes no argument
that the Circuit Court erred in entering default judgments against them.
Accordingly, assuming without deciding that Ellis may appear for Upland and
Olinda, we do not reach the merits of any claims relating to Upland or Olinda.

entering its Amended Final Judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 70. We
 
disagree. The Circuit Court entered the Amended Final Judgment
 after PF3 failed to comply with the Circuit Court's December 30,
 2008, order to specifically perform the DROA. HRCP Rule 70
 provides, in relevant part, that "[i]f real or personal property
 is within the State, the court in lieu of directing a conveyance
 thereof may enter a judgment divesting the title of any party and
 vesting it in others and such judgment has the effect of a
 conveyance executed in due form of law." Under the circumstances
 of this case, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in
 relying on HRCP Rule 70 in entering the Amended Final Judgment.
 
(3) Appellants contend that because it is impossible
 
to comply with the Circuit Court's December 30, 2008, order,
 which required the specific performance of the DROA within sixty
 days of the order, the Amended Final Judgment is invalid. We
 reject this argument. PF3's failure to comply with the Circuit
 Court's December 30, 2008, order did not preclude the Circuit
 Court from ordering other appropriate relief.
 
(4) We reject Appellants' arguments that the Amended
 
Final Judgment is substantively invalid, does not conform to the
 pleadings, is barred by judicial estoppel, and is an invalid
 mortgage foreclosure. The Amended Final Judgment is not
 substantively invalid because the Circuit Court was entitled to
 rely on HRCP Rule 70 and it had the authority to grant the relief
 it ordered. The Funais' requests for relief, which included
 divesting PF3 and Upland of title in Lot 8, were broad enough to
 encompass the relief provided in the Amended Final Judgment. 
Therefore, the Amended Final Judgment is not subject to
 invalidation for failure to conform to the pleadings or based on
 judicial estoppel. Appellants provide no persuasive authority to
 support their argument that the Circuit Court erred in entering
 the Amended Final Judgment because it constituted an invalid
 mortgage foreclosure, and we conclude that this argument is
 without merit. As noted, the Amended Final Judgment was properly
 entered because the Circuit Court was entitled to rely on HRCP

Rule 70 and it had the authority to grant the relief it ordered.
