IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBERT STAPLETON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-0545)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Robert Stapleton (Stapleton)
 
appeals from the "Order of Resentencing Revocation of Probation"
 
entered November 30, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court).
Stapleton contends the circuit court (1) erred when it
 
accepted Stapleton's guilty plea, (2) abused its discretion when
 it denied "[Stapleton's] Motion To Withdraw Guilty Plea," and (3)
 abused its discretion when it revoked probation and sentenced
 Stapleton to imprisonment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Stapleton's appeal is without merit.

(1) The circuit court did not err in accepting
 
Stapleton's guilty plea. 
Our evaluation is essentially a
 
constitutional one:
 
A trial judge is constitutionally required to ensure
that a guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly entered. Although
no specific dialogue is required, the court should make "an
affirmative showing by an on-the-record colloquy between the court
and the defendant wherein the defendant is shown to have a full
 understanding of what the plea of guilty connotes and its
consequences." 
State v. Solomon, 107 Hawai' i 117, 126, 111 P.3d 12, 21 (2005) 
(quoting State v. Williams, 68 Haw. 498, 499, 720 P.2d 1010, 1012
 
(1986) (citations and emphasis omitted). As such, we review the
 validity of Stapleton's guilty plea de novo. See State v.
 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai' i 87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000); See also 
State v. Topasna, 94 Hawai' i 444, 452, 16 P.3d 849, 857 (App. 
2000).
 
To ensure constitutional compliance, Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 11 provides specific guidance for
courts presented with Rule 11 guilty pleas

:
Rule 11.  PLEAS
 
. . . .
 
(c) Advice to defendant.  The court shall not accept a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first addressing
the defendant personally in open court and determining that
the defendant understands the following:
 
(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is
offered; and
 
(2) the maximum penalty provided by law, and the
maximum sentence of extended term of imprisonment, which may
be imposed for the offense to which the plea is offered; and
 
(3) that the defendant has the right to plead not
guilty, or to persist in that plea if it has already been
made; and
 
(4) that if the defendant pleads guilty or nolo
contendere there will not be a further trial of any kind, so
that by pleading guilty or nolo contendere the right to a
trial is waived; and
 
(5) that if the defendant is not a citizen of the
United States, entry of a plea to an offense for which the

   "HRPP Rule 11 (1999), specifically subsections (c) and (d) thereof,
implement[s] the constitutional requirement that a trial judge ensure that
a . . . plea be voluntarily and knowingly entered." Topasna, 94 Hawai' i at 
452, 16 P.3d at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted); See also State v.Merino, 81 Hawai' i, 198, 217, 915 P.2d 672, 691 (1996).

defendant has been charged may have the consequences of
deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States,
or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the
United States.
 
(d) Insuring That the Plea Is Voluntary.  The court
 
shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without
first addressing the defendant personally in open court and
determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of
force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement.
The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant's
willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from
any plea agreement.
. . . .
 
(f) Determining Accuracy of Plea. Notwithstanding the
acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court shall not enter a
judgment upon such plea without making such inquiry as shall
satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.
 
The circuit court conducted an extensive on-the-record
 
colloquy, addressing Stapleton fully under HRPP Rule 11(c) and
 
(d). At the January 25, 2012 plea hearing, the circuit court
 confirmed that Stapleton: (1) understood the charge and knew the
 
maximum penalty; (2) understood all terms and conditions of the
 
plea  agreement, including, notably, the condition of
 
participating in a court approved sex offender treatment program;
(3) understood the terms of the sex offender addendum; (4)
 
entered the plea voluntarily; (5) understood potential
 consequences of a guilty plea for non-U.S. citizens; (6)
 understood the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty; and
 (7) consulted an attorney and was satisfied with the attorney's
 services. The record thus shows that Stapleton voluntarily and
 knowingly entered his guilty plea.
 
Pursuant  to  HRPP  Rule  11(f),  the  circuit court found a
 
satisfactory factual basis for the plea after engaging Stapleton:
 
[circuit court]: It states that on April 16, 2011, in the
City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, I knowingly
subjected [complaining witness] to an act of sexual
penetration by compulsion by placing my mouth on her
genital.
 
Is that what happened in this case, Mr.
Stapleton?
 
[Stapleton]: I -- I plead guilty, yeah, yes.
 [circuit court]: Well, I understand you plead guilty, so
you acknowledging that what the factual basis there is on
the guilty plea form is what happened?
 
[Stapleton]: Yes.

Stapleton's denial of guilt in his presentence 
interview was after his guilty plea.  See State v. Cornelio, 68 
Haw. 644, 645 n.1, 727 P.2d 1125, 1126 n.1 (1986) (Defendant 
denied guilt at sentencing hearing and not contemporaneous with the tender of his plea; the Hawai' i Supreme Court held the 
sentencing judge was not required to conduct a searching inquiry.) 
(2) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying "[Stapleton's] Motion To Withdraw Guilty Plea." "Generally, we review the trial court's denial of a motion to withdraw guilty plea for abuse of discretion." Topasna, 94 
Hawai'i at 452, 16 P.3d at 857. 
"A defendant is entitled to withdraw his or her guilty 
plea after imposition of a sentence only upon a showing of manifest injustice." Foo v. State, 106 Hawai' i 102, 111, 102 
P.3d 346, 355 (2004) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). "There is no manifest injustice when the trial court has made an affirmative showing by an on-the-record colloquy between the court and the defendant wherein the defendant is shown to have a full understanding of what the plea of guilty connotes and its consequences." Id. at 112, 102 P.3d at 356 
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The circuit court made an affirmative showing through
 
its on-the-record colloquy. Stapleton's contentions that his
 trial counsel did not review the plea agreement with him were
 repudiated by his counsel who the circuit court found credible.
 
(3) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
revoking probation and resentencing Stapleton.
 
Whether probation should be granted, revoked, or
modified lies solely within the discretion of the sentencing
court. While the power of the court to revoke or to modify
the conditions of probation is well established, the
exercise of this authority must rest upon the sound and
enlightened judgment of the trial court. And where the
 record reflects justifiable cause for the revocation or the
modification of probation terms, the trial court's
determination will be sustained.

State v. Yamamoto, 79 Hawai' i 511, 514, 904 P.2d 525, 528 (1995) 
(ellipsis omitted) (quoting State v. Huggett, 55 Haw. 632, 
635-36, 525 P.2d 1119, 1122 (1974)). 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its
decision. Factors that indicate a plain and manifest abuse
of discretion are arbitrary or capricious actions by the
judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's
contentions. In general, to constitute an abuse it must
appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.
 
State v. Tauiliili, 96 Hawai' i 195, 198, 29 P.3d 914, 917 (2001) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 706-625(3) (Supp. 2012)
 
provides: "The court shall revoke probation if the defendant has
 
inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement
 imposed as a condition of the order . . . ." Stapleton
 understood that satisfactory participation in the sex offender
 program was a condition of his probation. His probation was
 meant to aid his rehabilitation. His participation in a sex
 offender program was a substantial requirement.
 
Stapleton refused to participate in the sex offender 
program on multiple occasions and failed to participate until clinically discharged with the concurrence of his probation officer. Stapleton argues that his refusal was excusable, based on State v. Reyes, 93 Hawai' i 321, 2 P.3d 725 (App. 2000). 
Reyes, however, is inapposite. 
In Reyes, the defendant never admitted to committing a
 
sex offense, unlike Stapleton. Reyes was convicted pursuant to a
 trial. Stapleton was convicted pursuant to a plea of guilty. 
Stapleton knowingly and voluntarily entered into a plea agreement
 in which satisfactory participation in sex offender treatment was
 an express condition. Stapleton's willful refusal to complete
 treatment was a justifiable cause for revoking probation.
 
"When the court revokes probation, it may impose on the
 
defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally
 for the crime of which the defendant was convicted." HRS
 ยง 706-625(5) (Supp. 2012). Stapleton pled guilty to sexual

assault in the second degree, a class B felony. HRS ยง 707-731(2)
 
(Supp. 2012). "A person who has been convicted of a class 
B . . . felony may be sentenced to an indeterminate term of
 imprisonment . . . . When ordering such a sentence, the court
 shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment which shall
 be . . . [f]or a class B felony โ 10 years[.]" HRS ยง 706-660
 (1993). The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 resentencing Stapleton to an indeterminate term of imprisonment
 for ten years.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order of Resentencing
 
Revocation of Probation" entered November 30, 2012 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
