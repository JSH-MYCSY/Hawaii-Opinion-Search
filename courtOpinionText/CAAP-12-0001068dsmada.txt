APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2000-07)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in this case, it appears that
 
we lack jurisdiction over the appeal that Intervenor/Cross-
Appellant/Appellant Friends of Makakilo (Appellant FOM) has
 asserted from the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's November 9,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2012 dismissal order because the circuit court has not reduced 
the said order to a separate judgment, as Rules 58 and 72(k) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) require in an 
administrative appeal from a circuit court pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2012). 
"Review of any final judgment of the circuit court 
under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." HRS § 91­15 (2012 Repl.). The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2012). Under HRS § 641-1(a), "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (emphasis added). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and 
Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citation omitted). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
has held that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding 
dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii 
Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996). 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote 
omitted). Additionally, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 
P.2d at 1338 (emphasis in original). 
Although the instant case involves an administrative

appeal, HRCP Rule 72(k)  similarly requires that, upon a circuit
court's adjudication of an administrative appeal, "the court
 having jurisdiction shall enter judgment." 
HRCP Rule 72(k). The
 
requirement of a separate judgment and requirement that the
 judgment resolve all claims or provide the necessary finding for
 certification under HRCP Rule 54(b) under the holding in 
Jenkins

 Rule 81(e) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires
that the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall apply to any proceedings in a
circuit court pursuant to appeal to the circuit court from a governmental
official or body (other than a court), except as otherwise provided in Rule72." 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright applies to a secondary appeal 
from a circuit court order that adjudicates an administrative appeal. See, e.g., Raquinio v. Nakanelua, 77 Hawai' i 499, 500, 
889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth in Jenkins apply to appeals from circuit court orders deciding appeals from orders entered by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations."). Therefore, where a circuit court failed to reduce dispositive orders in an administrative appeal to a separate judgment, we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction: 
In Raquinio's case, the requirements of HRCP
Rules 58 and 72(k) and Jenkins apply and have not
been satisfied. Therefore, Raquinio's appeal is
premature, and we do not have appellate
jurisdiction.
Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
Id.
 
Likewise in the instant administrative appeal, the
 
requirements of HRCP Rule 58, HRCP Rule 72(k) and Jenkins v.
 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright apply, and yet the requirements
 for appealability have not been satisfied because the November 9,
 2012 dismissal order has not been reduced to a separate judgment
 that, on its face, resolves all claims in this case by either
 entering judgment in favor of and against the appropriate parties
 or that contains the appropriate finding and certification under
 HRCP Rule 54(b). On April 19, 2013, the record on appeal for
 appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001068 was filed, by which
 time the circuit court had not entered an appropriate separate
 judgment in this case. Therefore, the November 9, 2012 dismissal

order is not an appealable judgment. Although exceptions to the 
final order requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the November 9, 2012 order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). Absent an appealable judgment, FOM's appeal is premature, and we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-12-0001068 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
