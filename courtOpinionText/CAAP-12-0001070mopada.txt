IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
GARY KARAGIANES, Appellant-Appellant, v. 
HAWAI'I OMBUDSMAN, ROBIN K. MATSUNAGA, Appellee-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2213-08)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth JJ.)
 
Appellant-Appellant Gary Karagianes (Appellant) appeals 
from (1) the "Order Granting Hawai 'i Ombudsman's Motion to
Dismiss" entered December 12, 2012, (2) the "Final Judgment" 
entered January 10, 2013, and (3) the "Order Denying Appellant's Motion for Reconsideration" also entered January 10, 2013 in the 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
The issue on appeal is whether the circuit court had 
jurisdiction to review a decision of Appellee-Appellee Hawai 'i
Ombudsman, Robin K. Matsunaga of the Office of the Ombudsman for the State of Hawai
'i (Ombudsman).
I. BACKGROUND
 
On April 12, 2012, Appellant sent a letter to the 
Ombudsman stating that he disagreed with a March 22, 2011 decision of the Hawai
'i Paroling Authority (Paroling Authority)
that denied his request for a reduced minimum term of incarceration. 
On April 24, 2012, at Appellant's request, the 
Ombudsman agreed to investigate Appellant's complaint against the

Paroling Authority. On June 19, 2012, the Ombudsman concluded
 
Appellant's complaint against the Paroling Authority could not be
 substantiated. The Ombudsman did not disclose any information
 relating to the investigation provided to them by the Paroling
 Authority. 
On June 28, 2012, Appellant asked the Ombudsman to
 
reopen his case and compel the Paroling Authority to reduce
 Appellant's term of incarceration. Appellant also asked the
 Ombudsman to provide him with additional information regarding
 the basis for its determination that his complaint lacked merit.
 On July 27, 2012, the Ombudsman informed Appellant that it would
 not re-open his case and that they lacked legal authority to
 compel the Paroling Authority to reduce Appellant's term of
 incarceration (Ombudsman's Decision). The Ombudsman's Decision
 also stated that they were prohibited by law from providing
 Appellant with information regarding the investigation.
II. DISCUSSION 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 96 affords the
 
Ombudsman immunity from judicial review. HRS § 96-17 (2012
 Repl.) provides: 
§96-17 Judicial review, immunity.  No proceeding or
decision of the ombudsman may be reviewed in any court,
unless it contravenes the provisions of this chapter. The
 ombudsman has the same immunities from civil and criminal
 liability as a judge of this State. The ombudsman and the
 ombudsman's staff shall not testify in any court with
respect to matters coming to their attention in the exercise
or purported exercise of their official duties except as may
be necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
 
(Emphasis added.) Appellant appears to contend the circuit court
 
had jurisdiction to review the Ombudsman's Decision because it
 contravened HRS § 96-14 (2012 Repl.). HRS § 96-14 provides
 "[a]fter a reasonable time has elapsed, the ombudsman shall
 notify the complainant of the actions taken by the ombudsman and
 by the agency." Here, the Ombudsman promptly notified Appellant
 of the actions taken through mail and telephone correspondence. 
Additionally, the Ombudsman has a duty to not disclose
 information relating to investigations unless disclosure is
 necessary to carry out their duties. See HRS § 96-9(b) (2012
 
Repl.). Appellant's contention that the Ombudsman contravened
 
2

Chapter 96 by not disclosing information relating to the
 
investigation is thus without merit.2
 
Finally, any contention that the Ombudsman's Decision
 
contravened a provision of Chapter 96 by refusing to compel the
 Paroling Authority to take certain actions is without merit. The
 Ombudsman does not have enforcement powers and the Ombudsman's
 opinions are advisory. See
 HRS §§ 96-4, -12, -13, -15 (2012
 
Repl.). 
III. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, the (1) the "Order Granting Hawai 'i 
Ombudsman's Motion to Dismiss" entered December 12, 2012, (2) the
 "Final Judgment" entered January 10, 2013, and (3) the "Order
 Denying Appellant's Motion for Reconsideration" also entered
 January 10, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit are
 affirmed.

 Appellant's underlying grievance appears to be a challenge of the
minimum term of imprisonment set for Appellant by the Paroling Authority.
Appellant relies on Coulter v. State, 116 Hawai' i 181, 172 P.3d 493 (2007) for
the proposition that the Paroling Authority was required to provide him withthe information upon which the Paroling Authority based its minimum term ofimprisonment determination. Appellant's reliance on Coulter in the instant case is misplaced. A Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 petition for
post-decree relief, filed against the State, is the appropriate means tochallenge the validity of a minimum term of imprisonment set by the ParolingAuthority; a judicial review of an ombudsman investigation is not. See 
generally Coulter, 116 Hawai' i at 184, 172 P.3d at 496.
