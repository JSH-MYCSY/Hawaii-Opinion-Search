Guard challenges his conviction based on the District
 
Court's denial of his motion to suppress statements and evidence
 on three grounds: first, that he was misled by the warnings
 given to him before his decision whether to take a breath or
 blood alcohol test; second, that the police failed to warn him of
 his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) before
 he decided whether to take a breath or blood alcohol test; and
 third, the police misinformed him regarding his statutory right
 to an attorney under HRS 803-9 (2014).

We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, 134 Hawai 'i 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014) cert. granted, 2014 
WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014). Based on Won, we conclude that the
