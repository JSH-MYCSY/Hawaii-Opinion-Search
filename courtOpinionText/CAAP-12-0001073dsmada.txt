APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1P1120007061)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
WITHOUT PREJUDICE FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-12-0001073,
 
consolidated with CAAP-12-0001075, it appears that we lack
 jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Hunnie Vaa's appeal from a
 Judgment dated December 12, 2012 because the judgment is not
 appealable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12 (Supp.
 2012).

"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). The intermediate court of appeals has 
jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2011). HRS § 641-12 provides that "[a]ppeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal matters." 
It appears that the December 12, 2012 judgment is
 
neither a final decision nor a final judgment because the
 sentencing in this case is incomplete and the judgment was not
 file stamped. The December 12, 2012 judgment indicates that the
 district court intends to determine the amount of restitution
 that Defendant-Appellant must pay as a part of her sentence. 
Court minutes indicate that on January 11, 2013, a restitution
 hearing scheduled for February 8, 2013 was cancelled. The record
 does not indicate whether restitution will or will not be imposed
 as part of Defendant-Appellant's sentence. 
Under similar circumstances in an appeal from a
 
district court judgment in a criminal case, we have held that a
 judgment is not final and appealable unless the sentence is
 final:
 
Judgments of conviction are not final unless
they include the final adjudication and the
final sentence. In the instant case, the
sentence imposed was not the final sentence
because the district court expressly left open
the possibility that its sentence of Kilborn
might include an order requiring Kilborn to pay
restitution. The court did not finally decide
whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount.
Consequently, the December 5, 2003 Judgment is
not final and, because it is not final, it is
not appealable.

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
appeal from the December 5, 2003 Judgment is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai 'i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005). The December 12, 2012 judgment is not final because the 
judgment indicates that the district court intends to sentence Defendant-Appellant to pay restitution in an amount to be determined at some time in the future and the judgment was not filed. Therefore, the sentence in the December 12, 2012 judgment is not an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-12. Absent an appealable final judgment in the record on appeal, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the consolidated appeals. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal Nos. CAAP-12-0001073
 
and CAAP-12-0001075 are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction
 without prejudice to Defendant Appellant asserting a timely
 appeal from entry of a final decision or judgment in district
 court Case No. 1P1120007061 after the district court determines
 whether to impose restitution, and if so, the amount of
 restitution that Defendant-Appellant must pay as a part of the
 sentence.
