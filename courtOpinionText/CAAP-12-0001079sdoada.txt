IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DEREK CAVILLIS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FCCR NO. 09-1-159K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Derek Cavillis (Cavillis) appeals
 
from the "Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence" entered
 
October 26, 2012 in the Family Court of the Third Circuit1
 
(family court). Cavillis was convicted on six counts of Sexual
 
Assault in the First Degree (Counts 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8) in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(b) (Supp.
 
2013) and five counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree
 
(Counts 2, 4, 9, 10, and 11) in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(b)
 
(Supp. 2013).
 
Cavillis contends the family court reversibly erred by:
 (1) denying his October 28, 2011 "Motion to Dismiss
 
Case due to Two Mistrials" (Motion to Dismiss);
 
(2) admitting interview videos without sufficient
 
foundation;
 
1

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) violating his "rights against double jeopardy" by
 
convicting him of Count 8, sexual assault in the first degree in
 
the third trial; and
 
(4) convicting and sentencing him despite ineffective
 
assistance of his counsel.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Cavillis's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The family court did not reversibly err by denying
 
Cavillis's Motion to Dismiss. Proceeding to the third trial did
 
not place him in double jeopardy under State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw.
 
47, 647 P.2d 705 (1982). At issue in Moriwake was whether a
 
defendant's rights to not be placed in "double jeopardy" required
 
dismissal of an indictment for manslaughter following two hung
 
jury trials. Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 50, 647 P.2d at 709. In
 
balancing the State's interest of punishing criminal conduct
 against the interest of ensuring fairness to defendants and
 
protecting the integrity of the judicial process, appellate
 
courts determine whether the trial court properly exercised its
 
discretion by considering: 
(1) the severity of the offense charged; (2) the number of
prior mistrials and the circumstances of the jury
deliberation therein, so far as is known; (3) the character
of prior trials in terms of length, complexity and
similarity of evidence presented; (4) the likelihood of any
substantial difference in a subsequent trial, if allowed;
(5) the trial court's own evaluation of relative case
strength; and (6) the professional conduct and diligence of
respective counsel, particularly that of the prosecuting
attorney.
 
Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712-13 (citation omitted).
 
The seriousness of first degree sexual assault charges
 
against Cavillis; the lengthy, complex prior trials; the
 
difference in evidence and defense and prosecutorial theories
 
presented in the trials; the juries' majority votes for
 
conviction in the first two trials; and the failure of the
 
prosecuting attorney in the first trial to object to allegedly
 
inadmissible evidence, to cross-examine Cavillis, and present
 
rebuttal to some of Cavillis's evidence show that the balance of
 
2
    
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the Moriwake factors favor the family court's decision to proceed
 
to the third trial and to deny Cavillis's Motion to Dismiss.
 (2) The family court did not abuse its discretion by 
admitting the Children's Justice Center witness interview videos 
over Cavillis's objection and pursuant to Hawaii Rules of 
Evidence (HRE) Rule 613(c) (1993). See State v. Assaye, 121 
Hawai'i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 1233 (2009) ("The determination 
of whether proper foundation has been established lies within the 
discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not be 
overturned absent a showing of clear abuse.") (internal quotation 
marks citations and brackets omitted). The family court acted 
within its discretion by finding the testimony that a witness had 
met with prosecutors a number of times in preparation for 
testifying in all three trials, elicited by Cavillis's counsel, 
constituted an implied claim that the witness' testimony had been 
influenced, rendering application of HRE Rule 613(c) appropriate. 
(3) Without reaching the constitutional elements of
 
Cavillis' claim that the family court placed him in double
 
jeopardy by convicting him of Count 8 Sexual Assault in the First
 
Degree in the third trial, we conclude that the failure to submit
 
Count 8 to the jury as Sexual Assault in the Third Degree
 
constituted error. Cavillis concedes that neither party brought
 
this error to the trial court's attention, but "[p]lain error or
 
defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they
 
were not brought to the attention of the court." Hawai 'i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52. The State concedes the error 
and correctly states that because there was sufficient evidence 
that Cavillis committed the offense of Sexual Assault in the 
Third Degree, HRS § 707-732, the family court's judgment against 
Cavillis as to Count 8, Sexual Assault in the First Degree, 
should be vacated and judgment should be entered by the family 
court that Cavillis violated HRS § 707-732, Sexual Assault in the 
Third Degree. See State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai 'i 354, 378, 227 
P.3d 520, 544 (2010). 
(4) Cavillis contends the family court erred by
 
convicting and sentencing him despite ineffective assistance of
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his counsel who allegedly "seriously misunderst[ood]" a
 
confrontation clause issue. We conclude the record is not
 
"sufficiently developed to determine whether there has been
 
ineffective assistance of counsel[,]" but Cavillis has alleged
 
facts that, if proven, would entitle him to relief and that his
 
allegations are not patently frivolous. State v. Silva, 75 Haw.
 
419, 439, 864 P.2d 583, 592-93 (1993). Therefore, this court
 affirms Cavillis's conviction without prejudice to his filing a
 
HRPP Rule 40 petition on his ineffective assistance of counsel
 
claim. Silva, 75 Haw. at 439, 864 P.2d at 592-93.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 26, 2012
 
"Judgment, Guilty Conviction and Sentence" entered in the Family
 Court of the Third Circuit is rejected in part, vacated and
 
remanded in part, and affirmed in part as follows: (1) Cavillis's
 
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is rejected without
 
prejudice to his subsequent filing of a HRPP Rule 40 post-
conviction motion for relief; (2) Count 8 is vacated and remanded
 
for entry of judgment that Cavillis violated HRS § 707-732,
 
Sexual Assault in the Third Degree; and (3) all remaining parts
 
are affirmed.
