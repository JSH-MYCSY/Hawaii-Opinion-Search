 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013).2 We affirm Tavares's conviction
 
and sentence.
 
A police officer pulled Tavares over for speeding,
 
after the officer's laser speed detection device revealed that
 Tavares's vehicle was traveling 67 miles per hour (mph) in a 50
 mph zone. The officer subsequently arrested Tavares for OVUII. 
After placing Tavares under arrest, the officer read to Tavares a
 form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle
 Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent Form). Tavares
 agreed to take a breath test and refused a blood test. Tavares's
 breath test showed that she had a breath alcohol concentration of
 .101 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath -- a concentration
 that exceeded the legal limit. Tavares moved to suppress the
 results of her breath test, and the District Court denied her
 motion. 
On appeal, Tavares challenges the District Court's
 
denial of her motion to suppress. Tavares argues that because
 the police failed to give her Miranda warnings before reading the
 Implied Consent Form to her and obtaining her decision on
 testing, the results of her breath test should have been
 suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation. Tavares further
 argues that the results of her breath test should have been
 suppressed because: (1) the police misinformed her of her
 statutory right to an attorney under HRS § 803-9 (1993); (2) the
 police misinformed her of the sanctions for refusing to submit to
 testing; and (3) based on Missouri v. McNeely, --- U.S. ---, 133
 
2/ HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
. . .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath[.]
 
Tavares's complaint charged her with OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) (Supp. 2013) and/or (a)(3), and alleged that she was subject tosentencing as a first offender in accordance with HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp.2013). However, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) withdrew the HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the charge and only proceeded to trial on thealleged HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) violation.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
S. Ct. 1552 (2013), the police violated her rights under the
 
Fourth Amendment in obtaining the results of her breath test. 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, No. CAAP-12-0000858, --- Hawai 'i ---, --- P.3d ---, 2014 WL 
1270615 (Hawai 'i App. Mar. 28, 2014) (as amended on May 2, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Tavares's motion to suppress, and we affirm Tavares's conviction and sentence under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) and (b)(1).

3/ Although the State withdrew the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the
OVUII charge, see footnote 2, supra, the typed portion of the District Court's
Judgment under "Violation Section" and its files erroneously indicate that
Tavares was convicted of violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). We
 direct the District Court to file a corrected judgment that clearly reflects
that Tavares was only convicted of violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), as a first
offender under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1).
