Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal by 
Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai' i, filed on March 5, 2013, the 
attachments thereto, the lack of an opposition, and the files 
herein, it appears that: 
(1) In a Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 
Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody (Petition) filed
 
on July 27, 2012 by Petitioner-Appellant James Mundon (Mundon),
 
Mundon challenged the minimum sentences imposed by the Hawaii
 
Paroling Authority in Cr. No. 5-1-0206 for his felony convictions
 
for Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree (Count I) and,
 
Kidnapping (Count II). 
(2) On November 30, 2012, Mundon's Petition was
 
denied.

(3) On December 5, 2012, in Cr. No. 5-1-0206, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court vacated Mundon's convictions for Counts I 
and II. 
(4) The overturning of Mundonâ€™s convictions on Counts I
 
and II eliminated Mundon's minimum sentences in Cr. No. 5-1-0206
 
for Counts I and II which he challenged in the Petition. 
Therefore, his challenge to those minimum sentences is moot.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to dismiss is 
granted and this appeal is dismissed as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 20, 2013.
