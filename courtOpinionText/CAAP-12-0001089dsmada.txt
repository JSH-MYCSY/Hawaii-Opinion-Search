APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2033-07)
 
ORDER GRANTING JANUARY 31, 2013 MOTION TO DISMISSING
INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/
 
Appellees Cades Schutte LLP, Bernice Littman, and Daniel H.
 
Devaney IV's (collectively referred to as "Appellees Cades
 
Schutte, Littman and Devaney") January 31, 2013 motion to dismiss
 
this interlocutory appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 
(2) Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellants KB Resort
 
Holdings, Anekona KBR LLC, Tashio Holdings LLC, Axle LLC, and Max
 
Holdings, Inc.'s (collectively referred to as "Appellants
 KB Resort, Anekona, Tashio, Axle, and Max"), February 5, 2013
 
memorandum in opposition to Appellees Cades Schutte, Littman and
 
Devaney's January 31, 2013 motion to dismiss this interlocutory
 
appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it
 
appears that we do not have appellate jurisdiction under Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1 (1993 & Supp. 2012) to review the
 
following two appealed orders that the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto
 
entered in this case:
 
(1) an October 24, 2012 "Order Denying in Part and
Granting in Part defendants' Motion to Dismiss,
Filed September 4, 2012" (hereinafter referred to
as "the October 24, 2012 dismissal order") that
purportedly dismissed part of Count 2 of
Appellants KB Resort, Anekona, Tashio, Axle, and
Max's complaint; and
 
(2) a December 13, 2012 "Order Denying in Part and
Granting in Part Plaintiffs' Motion for
Reconsideration of Order Denying in Part and
Granting in Part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or
in the Alternative, for Leave to File an
Interlocutory Appeal of the Dismissal of Direct
Claims in Count II of the Complaint, Filed
November 9, 2012" (hereinafter referred to as "the
December 13, 2012 order").
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . 
provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very 
judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the 
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
2
 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an 
order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against 
the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." 
Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is 
filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). Furthermore, even if the circuit court 
reduces the order to a separate judgment, "an appeal from any 
judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, 
on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or 
contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP 
[Rule] 54(b)." Id. at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added); 
Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 
1234, 1239 (1994). 
If the October 24, 2012 dismissal order did not
 
completely resolve all of Count 2 of Appellants KB Resort,
 
Anekona, Tashio, Axle, and Max's complaint, then the circuit
 
court was correct in not reducing the October 24, 2012 dismissal
 
order to a separate judgment on one or more but fewer than all
 
claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Under HRCP Rule 54(b),
 
the power of a lower court to enter a certification of
finality is limited to only those cases where (1) more than
one claim for relief is presented or multiple parties (at
least three) are involved, . . . and (2) the judgment
entered completely disposes of at least one claim or all of
the claims by or against at least one party.
 
Elliot Megdal and Associates v. Daio USA Corporation, 87 Hawai' i 
129, 133, 952 P.2d 886, 890 (App. 1998) (citations omitted; 
emphasis added). 
Instead, the circuit court entered the December 13,
 
2012 order, which purported to authorize Appellants KB Resort,
 
Anekona, Tashio, Axle, and Max to assert an interlocutory appeal
 
3
 from the October 24, 2012 dismissal order. We infer that the
 
circuit court purported to authorize the interlocutory appeal
 
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b), which provides the following:
 
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
 allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
 
(Emphases added).
 
However, Appellants KB Resort, Anekona, Tashio, Axle,
 
and Max's December 18, 2012 notice of appeal is not be timely
 
under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP). The Supreme Court of Hawai' i has interpreted the 
combination of HRS § 641-1(b) and HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) as follows:
 
We have interpreted HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)'s requirement that the
notice of interlocutory appeal be filed "within 30 days
after the date of entry of the . . . . order appealed from"
to mean that . . . [i]t is necessary for a party wanting to
 take an interlocutory appeal to move for an order allowing
the appeal, for the court to enter the order and for the
appellant to file the notice of appeal all within 30 days
from the filing of the order appealed from, unless the time
for appeal is extended pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(5).
 
State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai' i 404, 406, 967 P.2d 236, 238 (1998) 
(some emphasis added; citation and block quotation format 
omitted). "The order appealed from on an interlocutory appeal is 
not made final, for any purpose, by the allowance of the 
interlocutory appeal and the time period runs from the entry of 
the order, not from the allowance of the appeal." King v. 
Wholesale Produce Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 335, 741 P.2d 721, 722 (1987) (emphasis added).

 The holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994) overruled part of the holding in King v.
Wholesale Produce Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 741 P.2d 721 (1987).
Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239
(1994). Nevertheless, the holding in Jenkins "does not appear to disturb the 
4
 have held that we did not have jurisdiction over an appeal from 
an interlocutory order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) when "the court 
did not enter its written order allowing an interlocutory appeal 
within thirty days of the entry of the order from which 
Plaintiffs wished to appeal, despite Plaintiffs' prompt motion 
for such an order." Kohala Agriculture v. Deloitte & Touche, 86 
Hawai'i 301, 311, 9494 P.2d 141, 151 (App. 1997) ("Therefore, we 
conclude that Plaintiffs' appeal of the [interlocutory] order was 
untimely and we are without jurisdiction of that appeal."). 
In the instant case, the entry of the October 24, 2012
 
dismissal order (and not the entry of the December 13, 2012 order
 
purporting to authorize an interlocutory appeal) triggered the
 
thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing an
 
interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). Appellants
 
KB Resort, Anekona, Tashio, Axle, and Max did not file their
 
December 18, 2012 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry
 
of the October 24, 2012 dismissal order, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
 
required under the holdings in King v. Wholesale Produce Dealers
 
Ass'n of Hawaii and State v. Irvine. The failure to file a
 
timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional
 
defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts
 
cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon
 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP
 Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
 
change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
 
[the HRAP].").
 
In addition to the untimeliness of this appeal, the
 
October 24, 2012 dismissal order and the December 13, 2012 order
 
do not satisfy the requirements for an interlocutory appeal
 
holding in King with respect to HRS § 641-1(b)." Kohala Agriculture v.
Deloitte & Touche, 86 Hawai' i 301, 311 n.19, 9494 P.2d 141, 151 n.19 (App.
1997).

  pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). According to the Supreme Court of 
Hawai'i, the circuit court must do more than simply enter an 
order granting a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal from an interlocutory order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b); the 
circuit court must also include within the order an express 
conclusion that the interlocutory appeal is advisable for the 
speedy termination of the litigation, and the circuit court must 
additionally set forth in the order its reasons for that 
conclusion: 
If any order is entered, other than a final judgment, and a
party moves for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS
§ 641-1(b) . . . , the trial court shall carefully consider
the matter of whether it thinks an interlocutory appeal will
more speedily determine the litigation and, if it so
concludes, will set forth, in the order allowing the appeal,
its reasons for that conclusion.
 
Mason v. Water Resources International, 67 Haw. 510, 511-12, 694
 
P.2d 388, 389 (1985) (emphases added). In determining whether to
 
certify an order for an interlocutory appeal, the circuit court's
 
discretion is not unfettered but is circumscribed; it is
 
limited to those appeals "whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation." The words "speedy termination" are therefore
crucial to the determination of whether the trial court
 exercised its discretion properly. Although these words are
not specifically defined in the statute, they are not to be
read in isolation but are to be read in the context of the
 nature and purpose of HRS § 641-1 and the previous
admonitions by this court. The saving of time and
litigation expenses, without more, do not meet the
requirement of speedy termination. . . . On the other hand,
if the appeal may put an end to the action, obviously the
requirement is met.
 
Lui v. City and County of Honolulu, 63 Haw. 668, 671-72, 634 P.2d 
595, 598 (1981) (footnote omitted; emphases added). 
Consequently, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i dismissed an 
interlocutory appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction where a circuit court judge did not provide an express "determin[ation] 
that an interlocutory appeal from the orders entered would more 
speedily terminate the litigation. He simply said he would allow 
6
 an interlocutory appeal without expressing any determination on
 
the matter." McCabe v. Berdon, 67 Haw. 178, 180, 681 P.2d 571,
 
572 (1984).
 
Similarly in the instant case, the December 13, 2012
 
order purports to authorize Appellants KB Resort, Anekona,
 Tashio, Axle, and Max to assert an interlocutory appeal from the
 
October 24, 2012 dismissal order without providing any express
 
conclusion that the interlocutory appeal is advisable for the
 
speedy termination of the litigation. The December 13, 2012
 
order also does not set forth any reasons that would support a
 
conclusion that the interlocutory appeal is advisable for the
 
speedy termination of the litigation. In other words, because
 
the December 13, 2012 order does not satisfy the requirements
 
under HRS § 641-1(b) for authorizing an interlocutory appeal
 
under the holdings in Mason v. Water Resources International, Lui
 
v. City and County of Honolulu, and McCabe v. Berdon, the
 
October 24, 2012 dismissal order is not eligible for an
 
interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b). Consequently, we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-12­
0001089, and Appellants KB Resort, Anekona, Tashio, Axle, and
 
Max's appeal is premature.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

 interlocutory appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction is
 
granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001089 is
