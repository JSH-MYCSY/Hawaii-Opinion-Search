IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SHANKEL TORRICER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0845)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Shankel Torricer ("Torricer")
 
appeals from the December 14, 2012 Order of Resentencing;
 
Revocation of Probation, entered by the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit ("Circuit Court").

On appeal, Torricer contends that the Circuit Court 
"was wrong in failing to strike the [Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai'i's] Motion for Revocation of Probation where it did not 
comply with [Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 2.2." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Torricer's point of error as follows:
 
Torricer argues that Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure

("HRPP") Rule 2.2(g)  and Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 706­

 The Honorable Steven S. Alm presided.

 HRPP Rule 2.2(g) states in relevant part that "[e]very pleading
and other document shall be signed by the party or the party's counsel." Haw.
 
R. Penal P. 2.2(g).

625  are in conflict and that because HRPP Rule 2.2(g)
establishes specific procedures relevant to motions, its
 requirements prevail over the more general terms of HRS § 706­625. He relies on the principle of statutory construction 
providing that "where there is a plainly irreconcilable conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific will be favored." Richardson v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai' i 46, 55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1202 
(1994) (quoting Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 Haw. 349, 356-57, 742 P.2d 359, 366 (1987)) (internal quotations marks omitted). 
Assuming without deciding that HRPP Rule 2.2(g) and HRS
 
§ 706-625 are in conflict, the statute is the more specific as it
 relates to probation revocation signature requirements. HRPP
 Rule 2.2(g) addresses signature requirements with regard to
 "[e]very pleading and other document." HRS § 706-625, on the
 other hand, authorizes the "probation officer, the prosecuting
 attorney, [or] the defendant" to file an application to revoke
 probation. Thus, the statute addresses the more narrow (or
 specific) case, and the Circuit Court was correct to proceed on
 that basis. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 14, 2012 Order
 
of Resentencing; Revocation of Probation, entered by the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.

probation officer, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, or on its own
motion, after a hearing, may revoke probation . . . ." H AW. REV. STAT. § 706­
