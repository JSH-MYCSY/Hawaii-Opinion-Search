NO. CAAP-12-0001093
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
BHARAT KUMAR NARUMANCHI, Plaintiff-Appellant
v.
 
JYOTHI GUNTA, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D No. 12-1-7353)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Bharat Kumar Narumanchi from the "Order Granting Continuing
 Motion To/For: Continue Enforce Order dated 09-26-2012", filed on
 December 12, 2012 (December 12, 2012 order) and the "Most
 Emergent Ex Parte Motion To: Order," filed on December 17, 2012
 (December 17, 2012 order) in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit because the orders are not appealable orders under Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006).

In the December 12, 2012 order, the family court
 
appointed a custody evaluator; ordered income, expense, asset and
 
debt forms to be completed and exchanged; ordered that the
 parties' child would be cared for by a third party caregiver if
 both parties were not able to care for the child during the day
 or nighttime hours; and continued hearings on Wife's two motions,
 filed on November 19, 2012. 
The family court denied the "Most Emergent Ex Parte
 
Motion To:" which sought to modify the December 12, 2012 order by
 disallowing the third party caregiver from caring for the child
 at night, to permit Husband's mother to care for the child during
 Husband's custody days, and recusal of the judge for bias in
 favor of Wife. 
In family court cases "[a]n interested party aggrieved
 
by any order or decree of the court may appeal to the
 intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and
 fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the
 circuit court[.]" 
HRS § 571-54 (2006). In circuit court cases,
 
aggrieved parties may appeal from "final judgments, orders or
 decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012).
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2)
child custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal
support; and (4) division and distribution of
property and debts. Black v. Black, 6 Haw. App. 493,
 
728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57
Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977), the Hawaii Supreme
Court held that an order which finally decides parts
(1) and (4) is final and appealable even if part (2)
remains undecided. Although we recommend that, except
in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be
finally decided prior to a decision on all the other
parts, we conclude that an order which finally decides
part (1) is final and appealable when decided even if
parts (2), (3), and (4) remain undecided; that parts
(2), (3), and (4) are each separately final and

appealable as and when they are decided, but only if
part (1) has previously or simultaneously been
decided; and that if parts (2), (3), and/or (4) have
been decided before part (1) has been finally decided,
they become final and appealable when part (1) is
finally decided
.
 
Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987)
 
(footnote omitted). There is no final divorce decree that
 decides any part of the divorce. 
Appellant concedes that neither order he appeals from
 
was a final appealable order but requests appellate review under
 the collateral order doctrine. Under the collateral order
 doctrine,
 
appeals are limited to orders falling in that small class which
finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral
to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied
review and too independent of the cause itself to require that
appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is
adjudicated.
 
Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 321, 
966 P.2d 631, 633 (1998). The orders did not finally determine 
claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the divorce proceeding. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
CAAP-12-0001093 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
