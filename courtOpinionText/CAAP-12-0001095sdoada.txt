(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Colleen A. O'Brien (O'Brien)
 
appeals from the November 21, 2012 Judgment convicting her of
 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, a

On appeal, O'Brien argues that the District Court erred
 
when it (1) denied O'Brien's motion to dismiss the charge for
 (a) failure to define "alcohol" and (b) framing the allegations
 in the disjunctive; (2) admitted her custodial statements into
 evidence; (3) admitted her alcohol test result despite (a) a
 failure to provide a judicial determination of probable cause and
 (b) misleading and inaccurate warnings given to her prior to
 giving her consent and (c) a violation of her "right to withdraw
 any implied consent she had previously given for any warrantless
 searching at any time; (4) admitted the sworn statements of the
 intoxilyzer supervisor because they were "testimonial" and

violated her right to confrontation; and (5) found O'Brien guilty
 
upon insufficient evidence because the Intoxilyzer test results
 were admitted without sufficient foundation insofar as there was
 insufficient evidence (a) that the Intoxilyzer was maintained and
 tested for accuracy in conformity with the manufacturer's
 recommendations and (b) of compliance with Hawaii Administrative
 Rules (HAR) Title 11, Chapter 114 (i) regarding the licensing of
 the operator or (ii) approval of the Intoxilyzer where judicial
 notice of the sworn statements of the supervisor was improperly
 taken.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and 
arguments made by the parties, the applicable authority, the record, and in light of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's decision in 
State v. Won, SCWC-12-0000858 (Haw. Nov. 25, 2015) we reverse O'Brien's conviction for OVUII under HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(3).
