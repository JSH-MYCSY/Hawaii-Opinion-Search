APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0175-01 KTN)

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

In a personal injury case arising out of a motor

vehicle collision, Plaintiff-Appellant Jee-Eun Tscha (
Tscha)

appeals from the August 16, 2012 Judgment (Judgment) entered in

favor of Defendant-Appellee Kathe L. Thornton (Thornton) by the

Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1

I. BACKGROUND

On December 22, 2006, Thornton drove through the

intersection of Ward Avenue and Beretania Street, against a red

light, hitting Tscha's vehicle as Tscha drove along Ward Avenue

with the green light. Tscha was taken to the Straub emergency
 
room in an ambulance after the collision.

The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On January 26, 2010, Tscha filed a Complaint against

Thornton. The parties participated in mandatory arbitration

under the Court Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP).2

 
On October 18, 2010, CAAP Arbitrator Robert T.

Takamatsu (Arbitrator) awarded Tscha $20,000 in special damages,

$15,000 in general damages, and costs of $862.06. The Arbitrator

also reduced the total damages by $10,000 under the "Covered Loss

Deductible" (CLD) provision in Hawaii Revised Statues (HRS)

§ 431:10C-301.5

 for a total award of $25,862.06.
 
2 The Court Annexed Arbitration Program was established in 1986
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 601-20 (1993). See Murphy v.
Lovin, 128 Hawai' i 145, 151, 284 P.3d 918, 924 (App. 2011). HRS § 601-20
provides, in relevant part: 
(a) There is established within the judiciary a court
annexed arbitration program which shall be a mandatory and
nonbinding arbitration program to provide for a procedure to
obtain prompt and equitable resolution of certain civil
actions in tort through arbitration. The supreme court
shall adopt rules for the implementation and administration
of the program by January 1, 1987.

(b) All civil actions in tort, having a probable jury
award value, not reduced by the issue of liability,
exclusive of interest and costs, of $150,000 or less, shall
be submitted to the program and be subject to determination
of arbitrability and to arbitration under the rules
governing the program. The rules shall include a procedure
to classify and establish the order of priority according to
which the actions will be processed for the determination of
arbitrability and for the arbitration under the program.
The court may, at its discretion, remove any action from the
program.

is part of the Hawai' i motor vehicle insurance law. See 1997 Haw. Sess. L. 
Act 251, § 2 at 515." State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Gepaya, 103 Hawai' i 
142, 146, 80 P.3d 321, 325 (2003). HRS § 431:10C-301.5 (Supp. 2014) provides: 
§ 431:10C-301.5 Covered loss deductible.  Whenever a

person effects a recovery for bodily injury, whether by
suit, arbitration, or settlement, and it is determined that
the person is entitled to recover damages, the judgment,
settlement, or award shall be reduced by $5,000 or the
amount of personal injury protection benefits incurred,
whichever is greater, up to the maximum limit. The covered

loss deductible shall not include benefits paid or incurred
under any optional additional coverage, benefits paid under
any public assistance program, or benefits paid or incurred
under chapter 386.

On November 3, 2010, Tscha appealed from the

Arbitrator's award and requested a trial de novo pursuant to

Hawai'i Arbitration Rules (HAR) Rule  22.4  
3(...continued)

This court has described the CLD as follows:

In State Farm v. Gepaya, the Hawai' i Supreme Court
stated that HRS § 431:10C–301.5 (Supp. 1997) "was part of a
full scale change to fix the motor vehicle insurance systemdesigned to yield a significant reduction in premiums,control litigation, and provide adequate medical coveragewithout a cost shift to businesses and employees." Gepaya,
103 Hawai' i at 146, 80 P.3d at 325 (internal quotation
marks, citation, and brackets omitted). The supreme courtfurther stated that the CLD was "designed to discouragefrivolous law suits and yet at the same time set areasonable standard for litigation on legitimate claims."Id. at 147, 80 P.3d at 326 (quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No.171, in 1997 Senate Journal, at 798 (comments of SenatorBaker)). The CLD works in the following manner: 
1) In cases where the damages associated with an
automobile accident are less than $5,000, the claimant
is precluded from suing the negligent party in an
automobile accident. This is necessary in order to
keep the small claims out of litigation.

2) In cases where the claimant has incurred medical
expenses of between $5,000 and $10,000, the result of
the litigation will have subtracted from the award the
amount of medical expenses incurred. This precludes
the claimant from receiving funds for medical expenses
for which is covered [sic] under his own policy.

. . .

3) In cases where the claimant has incurred medical
expenses of $10,000 or more, any award obtained
through any means of litigation will be reduced by
$10,000.

omitted) (quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 171, in 1997 HouseJournal, at 999 (comments of Representative Menor)). The supreme court went on to state that the role of the statute"was to preclude a claimant from receiving a 'doublerecovery' for medical expenses which had been paid under thePIP coverage by reducing a recovery of damages for bodilyinjury[.]" Gepaya, 103 Hawai' i at 148, 80 P.3d at 327.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In a February 15, 2012 demand letter, Tscha requested

$1.25 million in general damages from Thornton to settle the

claim. In a March 28, 2012 letter, Tscha repeated the $1.25

million offer as a binding arbitration offer under HRS § 431:10C­
213.5.
5 On April 12, 2012, Thornton's counsel notified the

Circuit Court that Thornton had declined Tscha's binding

arbitration offer. 
 
A jury trial to determine the amount of damages caused

by Thornton's negligence commenced on June 11, 2012. 
Tscha

testified that her head and the left side of her body were hit

during the collision, and that after the collision, she could not

move her neck and her head and chest "hurt like hell[.]" 
 
The treating physician in the Straub emergency room,

Dr. Earl Kubota, testified that Tscha "had been in a motor

vehicle accident and complained of pain in the left hip, thigh,

neck, and low back as well as head." Dr. Kubota noted that there

was some tenderness on the left side of Tscha's head, her left

shoulder area, and her left thigh, and she complained of a

court and serve on the other parties and the Arbitration
Administrator a written Notice of Appeal and Request for

431:10C-213.5 Binding arbitration.  (a) A claimant or
defendant shall have the option to elect arbitration to
resolve a claim in tort that is covered by motor vehicle
liability insurance.

(b) A claimant or defendant may submit any dispute
relating to a tort claim to binding arbitration by either
filing a written request with the clerk of the circuit court
in the circuit where the accident occurred or by agreement.
(c) A claimant or defendant shall have the opportunity
to decline arbitration.

. . . .

(e) Fees and costs of arbitration shall be borne
equally by the parties, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties.
(f) Collection of any arbitration award issued under
this section shall be limited to the applicable liability
policy limit, unless the insured tortfeasor otherwise
agrees.

headache. She exhibited no decreased range of motion in her neck

or back, vertebral point tenderness, muscle spasm, or fracture or

dislocation. Dr. Kubota discharged Tscha that same day in

"stable condition" with no limitations and recommended "local ice

to the painful areas and Tylenol, acetaminophen, for pain." He

also referred Tscha to Dr. Ira D. Zunin (Dr. Zunin) for a follow-
up examination. 
 
On January 5, 2007, Tscha sought treatment from Dr.

Zunin, who listed Tscha's chief complaints as daily recurrent

headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, upper extremity radiation,

low back pain, and left hip pain with radiation to the left lower

extremity. Dr. Zunin offered Tscha "a brief course of manual

therapy and physical therapy" and prescribed naproxen 500 mg. 
 
Tscha testified that for the first six months after the

2006 accident, she suffered from daily migraines, that following

those initial six months, she experienced between one and five

migraines per week, and that at the time of trial, she continued

to experience pain and her activity was limited. 
 
Evidence presented at trial showed that between January

2007 and January 2010, Tscha sought treatment, including physical

therapy, manual therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, and herbs

and/or nutritional supplements from various healthcare providers. 
 Tscha testified that because she was concerned about potential

side effects from certain medicines, she did not take them, and

that she had recently stopped taking even Extra Strength Tylenol. 
 She believed that the treatments she had pursued, such as

massage, acupuncture, and stretching, helped to relieve her pain. 
 At trial, Tscha introduced Plaintiff's Exhibit 23, a "Summary of

Medical Expenses", listing fourteen different providers and total

medical expenses of $41,945.77. 
 
Tscha testified that she had previously been in a

"minor car accident", in 1986, when she was twenty or twenty-one

years old. She began to experience migraines "that year or the
 
year after," and between the previous accident and the December

22, 2006 incident, she experienced approximately four or five

migraines, for which she did not seek treatment. 
 
5

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thornton's expert witness, Dr. Anthony J. Mauro (Dr.

Mauro), testified that he would apportion 100 percent of Tscha's

"currently described pains in the neck, low back, hip, and right

shoulder" to the 2006 collision and that he would apportion 20

percent of Tscha's migraine headaches to any pre-existing

condition and 80 percent to the exacerbation of her symptoms from

the 2006 collision. In his June 7, 2011 independent medical

examination report, he also stated the following:

The type, intensity, frequency, and duration of treatments
provided fall outside acceptable medical standards as
appropriate for the conditions diagnosed. Evidence based

application of massage and physical therapy limits such
treatments to a few weeks to a few months following an acute
injury. Prolonged massage and/or physical therapy
treatments have not been demonstrated useful for improving
long-term discomfort or functional capacity. . . . Prolonged
therapies that have little or no chance of improving chronic
discomfort and improving functional capacity are not cost
effective, and may lead to passive dependance [sic], and may
supplant more appropriate self-directed therapies including
restitution of activities of daily living, and self-directed
rehabilitative exercises, which help to avoid deconditioning
and re-aggravation of soft tissue sprain and strain.

. . . 
 There are no significant findings on imaging studies that
can relate to the subject motor vehicle accident. The

findings on the MRI of the brain are nonspecific. While it

is true that the "foci of gliosis" and the hemispheres can
be seen in instances of migraine headache, there is no
conclusion regarding the clinical significance of these
"spots." There is no clinical evidence that such spots are
associated with any clinical effect. There is no specific
management of the "spots" in reference to migraine
headaches. Imaging of the cervical and lumbar spine is
limited to minimal degenerative changes, preexisting, with
no evidence of traumatic neck or low back injury.

. . . 
 Prognosis is guarded. It is now four-and-a-half years from
the injury. The patient has chronic symptoms, reports that
she cannot work on her neck by herself, cannot engage in
exercise because it aggravate[s] symptoms, has stopped
working because she finds mental effort frustrating, and
appears, basically, interested in pursuing endless passive
modality therapies with the unrealistic expectation that
she will "gradually improve."

Impairment sustained by the patient as a result of the
accident on December 22, 2006 are limited to subjective
limitations based on reports that activities increase
subjective symptoms. There is no documentation of an

organic structural lesion that would be aggravated by
sitting, standing, returning to work duties, or performance
of reasonable rehabilitative exercises. The patient's
inability to engage in such activities is based on her

6

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
subjective report of increased symptomatology. She has

eschewed prescription of medications that might improve
chronic migraines.

. . . 
 There is no objective medical basis on which to declare the
patient disabled from reasonable work activities.

. . . 
 I do not find evidence of a concurrent medical nor

psychological condition affecting Ms. Tscha's recovery other
than her subjective assessment that she cannot return to
activities because she experiences discomfort, and a likely
role of secondary gain motivation.

Tscha's expert witness, Dr. Huidy Shu (Dr. Shu),

testified that he believed Tscha suffered from chronic pain and

"classic migraine with aura." He also opined that the migraines
 
were "triggered by the [December 22, 2006] auto accident." He

testified that MRI scans of Tscha's brain "showed multiple white

matter lesions" that "are basically abnormalities within the

deeper parts of the brain" that are much more likely to be found

in patients with migraine with aura. Based on Tscha's concerns

about prescription medications, Dr. Shu prescribed a commonly

used preventative medicine for migraines with a "very, very low

likelihood of developing side effects." However, he also
 
testified that "[t]here is some research that backs up the use of

certain alternative therapies for migraines" and that Tscha's

desire to pursue alternative care was "perfectly reasonable." 
 
Thornton's counsel elicited testimony from both Dr.

Mauro and Dr. Shu that migraines are more common in women than in

men. During redirect examination, Shu testified that the fact

that migraines are more common in women than in men did not

"exclude trauma as a cause of migraine in a woman[.]" He also

testified that despite Tscha's previous history of migraines,

Tscha's lack of migraines in the six years preceding the December

22, 2006 accident was "more consistent with a latent condition." 
 
Tscha requested an award of $465,500. In contrast,
 
Thornton argued that Tscha's special damages should be limited to

the cost of the ambulance service ($542.40) and the Straub

emergency room care ($1,680.36), which totaled $2,230.76, and

7

 

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that $2,000 for general damages "would not be unreasonable." 
 
Thornton also stated that if the jury wanted "to award the outer

limits of what could be considered reasonable, according to Dr.

Mauro, that would constitute two to three months of treatment[,]"

which would include "[t]he ambulance, the Straub ER, 18 visits to

Dr. Zunin, and one visit to A & C Wellness and Healing." The

total cost of these treatments was "roughly $4,303.57." 
 
On June 15, 2012, the parties agreed upon jury 
instructions. On June 18, 2012, before closing statements were to be given, the Circuit Court informed the parties that it would be revising the jury instructions to include a portion of Hawai
'i 
Standard Civil Jury Instructions (HAWJIC) No. 7.1 because it 
"felt it was necessary to have a brief definition of legal 
cause." The proposed instruction was the first sentence of HAWJIC No. 7.1: "An act or omission is a legal cause of an injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury." The proposed instruction omitted the second clause of HAWJIC No. 7.1,
6 which states:
 
One or more substantial factors such as the conduct of

more than one person may operate separately or together to
cause an injury or damage. In such a case, each may be a
legal cause of the injury/damage.

Tscha objected to this proposed instruction

(Instruction No. 7.1) as being incomplete and potentially

misleading to the jury. The Circuit Court stated that it would

give the proposed Instruction No. 7.1 over Tscha's objection. 
 
On June 18, 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor

of Tscha, awarding special damages of $2,200 and general damages

of $4,300.

On June 21, 2012, Thornton moved to apply a $10,000

CLD7 to the verdict amount and for $15,000 in attorneys' fees and
 
$13,648.80 in costs as CAAP sanctions under HAR 258 and HAR 26.

Tscha did not dispute, either before the Circuit Court or on
appeal, that the CLD of $10,000 was applicable to this case under HRS
§ 431:10C–301.5.

8 HAR 25 provides:

Rule 25. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN THE TRIAL DE NOVO; COSTS.

(A) The "Prevailing Party" in a trial de novo is the
party who (1) appealed and improved upon the arbitration
award by 30% or more, or (2) did not appeal and the
appealing party failed to improve upon the arbitration award
by 30% or more. For the purpose of this rule, "improve" or
"improved" means to increase the award for a plaintiff or to
decrease the award for the defendant.

(B) The "Prevailing Party" under these rules, as
defined above, is deemed the prevailing party under any
statute or rule of court. As such, the prevailing party is
entitled to costs of trial and all other remedies as

provided by law, unless the Court otherwise directs.

9 HAR 26 provides:

Rule 26. SANCTIONS FOR FAILING TO PREVAIL IN THE TRIAL DE

NOVO.

(A) After the verdict is received and filed, or the
court's decision rendered in a trial de novo, the trial
court may, in its discretion, impose sanctions, as set forth
below, against the non-prevailing party whose appeal
resulted in the trial de novo.

(B) The sanctions available to the court are as
 
follows:

(1) Reasonable costs and fees (other than attorneys'
fees) actually incurred by the party but not otherwise
taxable under the law, including, but not limited to, expert
witness fees, travel costs, and deposition costs;
(2) Costs of jurors;
(3) Attorneys' fees not to exceed $15,000;
 
(C) Sanctions imposed against a plaintiff will be
deducted from any judgment rendered at trial. If the

plaintiff does not receive a judgment in his or her favor or
the judgment is insufficient to pay the sanctions, the
plaintiff will pay the amount of the deficiency. Sanctions

imposed against a defendant will be added to any judgment
rendered at trial.

(D) In determining sanctions, if any, the court shall
consider all the facts and circumstances of the case and the intent and purpose of the Program in the State of Hawai' i.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On July 30, 2012, the Circuit Court filed the "Order

Granting in Part Defendant Kathe L. Thornton's Motion for

Application of Covered Loss Deductible, and for Attorney's Fees

and Costs, Filed 6/21/12," ordering that the $10,000 CLD would be

applied to the $6,500 jury verdict and that Thornton would be

awarded $10,000 in attorneys' fees as CAAP sanctions. On August
 
16, 2012, the Circuit Court entered the Judgment in favor of

Thornton. 
 
On August 24, 2012, Tscha filed a post-judgment Motion 
for New Trial pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 59, arguing that Instruction No. 7.1 was improper and the jury's verdict was inconsistent and against the manifest weight of the evidence. On October 2, 2012, Thornton filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion for New Trial. 
On October 10, 2012, the Circuit Court continued a

hearing on the Motion for New Trial to obtain trial transcripts

and asked the parties to file supplemental memoranda within two

weeks after the trial transcripts became available.

On November 7, 2012, Tscha notified the Circuit Court

that the transcripts had been received and requested a briefing

schedule. On November 26, 2012, Tscha was notified that the

requested supplemental memoranda were due by December 14, 2012.

On November 22, 2012, Tscha's Motion for New Trial was 
denied by operation of law pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3) because ninety days had lapsed from 
the date of filing without the Circuit Court acting on the 
motion. 
On December 14, 2012, the parties filed the requested

supplemental memoranda. 
 
During a December 18, 2012 telephonic status

conference, the parties discussed Tscha's ex parte motion10 under

HRAP 4(a)(4)(B) to request a 90-day extension of time to file her

Notice of Appeal to allow the Circuit Court time to consider the

10

The motion was dated December 17, 2012 but was not filed until
December 19, 2012. 
 
10

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supplemental memoranda the parties had submitted on December 14,

2012. Tscha's memorandum in support of the motion had noted

that Tscha's Motion for New Trial would be considered

automatically denied as of November 22, 2012 under HRAP 4(a)(3)

unless the Circuit Court granted the motion for extension of

time. 
 
The Circuit Court set the hearing for Tscha's motion

for extension of time for December 21, 2012. The Circuit Court

also indicated that it intended to issue a ruling on the

underlying Motion for New Trial by the end of December 19, 2012. 
 
On December 20, 2012, the Circuit Court entered a

minute order denying Tscha's Motion for New Trial, concluding

that the jury instruction on legal cause, as given, was necessary

and not incomplete, prejudicial, or misleading, and that the

verdict did not evidence any failure by the jury to follow

applicable law. 
 
Tscha timely filed a Notice of Appeal on December 21,

2012.

II.	
	POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL

Tscha raises three points of error on appeal:

(1) The Circuit Court erred in giving an incomplete

instruction on legal cause and the error was prejudicial to

Tscha;

(2) The Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying

Tscha's Motion for New Trial; and

(3) The Circuit Court abused its discretion in

imposing CAAP sanctions in addition to applying the CLD.

III. 
APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW

When jury instructions, or the omission thereof, are
at issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when
read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or
misleading. Erroneous instructions are presumptively
harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it
affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the
error was not prejudicial.

Kobashigawa v. Silva, 129 Hawai 'i 313, 320, 300 P.3d 579, 586 
(2013) (quoting Nelson v. Univ. of Haw., 97 Hawai 'i 376, 386, 38 
P.3d 95, 105 (2001)). 
11

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Both the grant and the denial of a motion for new
trial is within the trial court's discretion, and we will
not reverse that decision absent a clear abuse of

discretion. Unlike motions for a directed verdict or a

JNOV, the movant need not, on a motion for new trial,
convince the court to rule that no substantial evidence

supports its opponent's case, but only that the verdict
rendered for its opponent is against the manifest weight of
the evidence. 
 
A . . . court abuses its discretion whenever it

exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party.

In cases of conflicting evidence, the credibility of
the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are
within the province of the trial court and, generally, will
not be disturbed on appeal. It is not the function of

appellate courts to second-guess the trier of fact where
there is substantial evidence in the record to support its
conclusion.

296-97, 141 P.3d 459, 469-70 (2006) (internal citations and

quotation marks omitted, format altered).

"Under the plain language of HAR 26, it is within the

discretion of the court whether to award sanctions and if so, for

what amount." Weite v. Momohara, 124 Hawai
'i 236, 251, 240 P.3d 
899, 914 (App. 2010) (citing Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki

Corp.), 76 Hawai
'i 494, 511, 880 P.2d 169, 186 (1994)). 
IV. DISCUSSION

A. Jury Instruction No. 7.1

Tscha argues that the Circuit Court erred in giving

Instruction No. 7.1 because the instruction omitted the second

clause of HAWJIC No. 7.1. The Circuit Court gave Instruction No.

7.1 as follows: "An act or omission is a legal cause of an

injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the

injury." Tscha contends that by omitting the second clause of
 
HAWJIC No. 7.1, the Circuit Court failed "to explain that there

could be more than one substantial cause" of Tscha's migraines,

and that based on the evidence presented at trial and Thornton's

closing arguments,

[t]he jury could have mistakenly concluded from the evidence
that, although the car accident caused or aggravated Ms.
Tscha's migraine condition, because there were other
contributing causes such as the prior accident, family 
 
12

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
history, age[,] and gender[,] it was not the substantial
factor under the legal cause instruction given. 
 
We disagree. First, "appellate courts are not bound by
 
pattern jury instructions." Dolan v. Hilo Med. Center,  127

Hawai'i 325, 342, 278 P.3d 382, 399 (App. 2012) (citing State v. 
Mark, 123 Hawai 'i 205, 219, 231 P.3d 478, 492 (2010)); see also 
State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai 'i 325, 335, 966 P.2d 637, 647 (1998) 
(rejecting defendant's argument "that deviation from the HAWJIC

is prejudicial per se" and holding that "[a] failure . . . to

strictly conform to HAWJIC [instructions] does not automatically

result in incomplete and confusing jury instructions.").

Second, the language the Circuit Court omitted from

HAWJIC No. 7.1 arguably would have been superfluous, confusing,

or misleading in that it implies that there was more than one

tortfeasor or act of negligence, and does not implicate pre­
existing conditions:

One or more substantial factors such as the conduct of

more than one person may operate separately or together to
cause an injury or damage. In such a case, each may be a
legal cause of the injury/damage.

(Emphasis added). 
 
Third, and more importantly, the Circuit Court also

gave a separate Instruction No. 7.3 on "Pre-Existing Injury or

Condition," which stated:

In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
awarded to plaintiff, you must determine whether plaintiff
had an injury or condition which existed prior to the
December 22, 2006 incident. If so, you must determine
whether plaintiff was fully recovered from the pre-existing
injury or condition or whether the pre-existing injury or
condition was latent at the time of the subject incident. A

pre-existing injury or condition is latent if it was not
causing pain, suffering or disability at the time of the
subject incident.

If you find that plaintiff was fully recovered from
the pre-existing injury or condition or that such injury or
condition was latent at the time of the subject incident,
then you should not apportion any damages to the pre­
existing injury or condition.

If you find that plaintiff was not fully recovered and
that the pre-existing injury or condition was not latent at
the time of the subject incident, you should make an
apportionment of damages by determining what portion of the
damages is attributable to the pre-existing injury or
condition and limit your award to the damages attributable
to the injury caused by defendant.

13

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
If you are unable to determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, what portion of the damages can be attributed
to the pre-existing injury or condition, you may make a
rough apportionment.

If you are unable to make a rough apportionment, then
you must divide the damages equally between the pre-existing
injury or condition and the injury caused by defendant.

Instruction No. 7.3 clearly conveyed that it was the

jury's prerogative to decide whether Tscha had any pre-existing

injuries or conditions, and if so, whether those injuries or

conditions were latent or not latent. The jury was specifically

instructed that it was free to determine "what portion of the

damages can be attributed to the pre-existing injury or

condition[.]" (Emphasis added.) The instruction thus gave the
 
jury the option to find that Tscha's pre-existing injury or

condition was not latent but that some of the damages could also

be apportioned to Thornton's conduct, and made it clear that it

was possible that both a pre-existing injury or condition and

Thornton's conduct could be legal causes of Tscha's injuries and

were not mutually exclusive causes. 
 
Tscha nonetheless argues that Instruction No. 7.3

[did] not cure the defect in failing to provide a complete
instruction on legal cause, because the jury might never
reach apportionment if it mistakenly applies the causation
analysis. . . . Thus, if the jury erroneously concluded that
some other factor (for example, the 1986 accident) was the
most substantial factor in causing Ms. Tscha's migraines,
and therefore erroneously concluded that the accident caused
by Ms. Thornton was not a legal cause of Ms. Tscha's
migraine[s], it would never have the opportunity to make an
apportionment of damages. The only damages which are
subject to apportionment are the ones found to have been
legally caused by defendant.

However, nowhere in the jury instructions was the jury

instructed that it must find that Thornton's conduct was "the

substantial factor" or "the most substantial factor" in order to

determine that Thornton's conduct was a legal cause of Tscha's

injuries. Indeed, the language of Instruction No. 7.1 reads: 
 "An act or omission is a legal cause of an injury if it was a

substantial factor in bringing about the injury." (Emphasis

added.)

14

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
While the Circuit Court's decision not to give the

second clause of HAWJIC No. 7.1 meant that Instruction No. 7.1

did not explicitly state that "[o]ne or more substantial factors

such as the conduct of more than one person may operate

separately or together to cause an injury or damage[,]" the

language of Instruction No. 7.3 made it clear to the jury that

more than one factor, including a pre-existing condition, could

have contributed to Tscha's injuries. "Jury instructions . . .
 
must be considered as a whole. Moreover, a refusal to give an

instruction that correctly states the law is not error if another

expressing a substantially similar principle is given." Montalvo

v. Lapez, 77 Hawai
'i 282, 286, 884 P.2d 345, 349 (1994) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Pioneer Mill Co., Ltd., 64 Haw. 168, 180, 637 P.2d 1131, 1140 (1981)). In light of Instruction No. 7.3, Tscha's argument that, without receiving the second clause of HAWJIC No. 7.1, the jury may have erroneously concluded that Thornton's conduct could not be a "substantial factor" in bringing about Tscha's injuries if other factors also contributed to Tscha's injuries is of no avail. 
We cannot conclude that Instruction No. 7.1, when 
considered in the context of all of the other instructions, was "prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading." Kobashigawa, 129 Hawai
'i at 320, 300 P.3d at 586. 
Thus, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in giving Instruction No. 7.1. 
B. Motion for New Trial

Tscha argues that the Circuit Court abused its

discretion in denying her Motion for New Trial because

Instruction No. 7.1 was improper. As we conclude that

Instruction No. 7.1 as given was not erroneous, we need not

further address this contention.

Tscha also contends that the Circuit Court erred in

denying her Motion for New Trial because "the shockingly small

verdict" is against the manifest weight of the evidence presented

at trial. 
 
15

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Inasmuch as the questions presented involve the scope
of special compensatory damages, the underlying principles
relating to damages in the personal injury context are
pertinent. Compensatory damages seek to "compensate the
injured party for the injury sustained," Kuhnert v. Allison,
76 Hawai' i 39, 44, 868 P.2d 457, 462 (1994), in hopes of
"restor[ing] a plaintiff to his or her position prior to the
tortious act[,]" Zanakis–Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98
Hawai
'i 309, 327, 47 P.3d 1222, 1240 (2002) (Acoba, J.,
concurring). The law divides such "damages into two broad
categories-general and special." Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw.
45, 50, 451 P.2d 814, 819 (1969). General damages
"encompass all the damages which naturally and necessarily
result from a legal wrong done[,]" id., and include such
items as "pain and suffering, inconvenience, and loss of
enjoyment which cannot be measured definitively in monetary
terms." Dunbar v. Thompson, 79 Hawai' i 306, 315, 901 P.2d
1285, 1294 (App. 1995) (citation omitted). Special damages
are "the natural but not the necessary result of an alleged
wrong[,]" Ellis, 51 Haw. at 50, 451 P.2d at 819, and are
"often considered to be synonymous with pecuniary loss and
include such items as medical and hospital expenses, loss of
earnings, and diminished capacity." Dunbar, 79 Hawai' i at 
315, 901 P.2d at 1294.

Bynum v. Magno, 106 Hawai 'i 81, 85-86, 101 P.3d 1149, 1153-54 
(2004).

Tscha argues that the jury's $2,200 special damages

award was deficient:

In this case, when the $2,000.00 [sic] special damage
verdict is compared to the evidence, it is clear that amount
is not within the range of substantial evidence. While

certain injuries and damages were contested, the $2,000.00
[sic] awarded for special damages does not even begin to
approach to plaintiff's proven expenses for items which are
not in dispute. Defendant admitted to liability for
expenses related to the emergency room visit, which totalled
$2,230.76. There was no dispute that 100% of Ms. Tscha's
soft tissue injuries were attributable to the accident; the
total cost of medical visits relating to those complaints is
$14,743.51. The total cost for imaging studies was:
$8,081.00. . . . the cost of physical therapy and massage
undertaken within a few weeks or months of the accident was

$4,303.57. . . . it is clear that Ms. Tscha's undisputed
special damages were at least $14,615.33. There is no view

of the evidence in this case that would render the $2,000.00
[sic] special damage award consistent with the special
damages proven at trial[.]

She cites to Striker v. Nakamura  for the proposition

that where

the verdict of the jury was grossly inadequate[,] . . .
demonstrates failure to consider essential elements of

damage or damages in amount[s] conceded to have been
suffered . . . [, and] demonstrates failure to abide by the
instructions of the court and an improper compromise between 
 
16

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
liability and compensation[, . . . ] there was error of law
in overruling the motion for a new trial[.]

Striker v. Nakamura, 50 Haw. 590, 593, 446 P.2d 35, 37 (1968).

In Striker, the "plaintiff proved that she incurred

medical expenses totalling $540.91 and suffered damage to her

automobile in the sum of $107.73. It was not disputed that

plaintiff incurred expenses and suffered damages totalling

$648.64." Striker, 50 Haw. at 593, 446 P.2d at 37. The

defendant "conceded to the reasonableness of medical expenses

totalling $540.91 and bills, checks, etc., were introduced into

evidence without any objection." Id. at 591, 446 P.2d at 36. 
 
Thus, the jury's verdict of $307.73 was "grossly inadequate" and

it was error for the trial court to deny plaintiff's motion for

new trial on the issue of damages. Id. at 593, 446 P.2d at 38. 
 
The instant case is distinguishable from Striker in

that, while Thornton did not dispute the stated value of Tscha's

medical expenses, she did dispute whether they were reasonable

and whether Thornton should be held liable for all of them. 
 During closing argument, Thornton argued that Tscha's special

damages should be limited to the cost of the ambulance service

($542.40) and the Straub emergency room care ($1,680.36), and

that $2,000 for general damages "would not be unreasonable." 
 
Thornton also argued that if the jury wanted "to award the outer

limits of what could be considered reasonable, according to Dr.

Mauro, that would constitute two to three months of treatment[,]"

which would include "[t]he ambulance, the Straub ER, 18 visits to

Dr. Zunin, and one visit to A & C Wellness and Healing." The

total cost of these treatments was "roughly $4,303.57." Thus,

Tscha's special damages were not undisputed as Tscha claims.

It was Tscha's burden to prove both that she suffered 
injuries as a result of the collision and the extent and value of her damages related to those injuries. See Kaopuiki v. Kealoha, 
104 Hawai
'i 241, 249, 87 P.3d 910, 918 (App. 2003). The issue of 
causation was in dispute as to some of the medical expenses, and both parties introduced evidence to support their conflicting positions. It appears the jury decided that Tscha failed to show 
17

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that her migraines were legally caused by the collision and

accordingly did not award any special damages for the treatment

she sought for her migraines. Tscha's argument - that the
 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in failing to grant her

Motion for New Trial because the jury's award was inadequate ­
"fails to acknowledge evidence supporting the jury's verdict in

this case." Id. at 251, 87 P.3d at 920. For example, Dr. Mauro
 
stated in his independent medical examination report and trial

testimony that the amount and type of treatments Tscha had

received was not reasonable or appropriate and that there was no

medical or physiological basis for the limitation of Tscha's

activity. 
 
Tscha also argues that the jury's $4,300 general 
damages award was "clearly insufficient" because "no reasonable juror could conclude that the $4,000 [sic] award reflected adequate compensation for Ms. Tscha's pain and suffering." It is a "well-settled principle in this jurisdiction that 'the proper amount of damages [to be awarded] . . . is within the exclusive province of the jury, since jurors are the sole judges of all disputed questions of fact.'" Kato v. Funari, 118 Hawai
'i 375, 
381, 191 P.3d 1052, 1058 (2008) (citing Knodle v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel, Inc., 69 Haw. 376, 385, 742 P.2d 377, 383 (1987)). "It is not the function of appellate courts to second-guess the trier of fact where there is substantial evidence in the record to support its conclusion." Stanford Carr, 111 Hawai
'i at 296-97, 141 P.3d 
at 469-70 (citation omitted). Reviewing the entirety of the record, it appears that substantial evidence supported the jury's general damages award in this case; therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tscha's Motion for New Trial. 
C. CAAP Sanctions and the Covered Loss Deductible

Tscha argues that by both applying the CLD and awarding

CAAP sanctions to Thornton, the Circuit Court unconstitutionally

impeded Tscha's right to a civil jury trial under article 1, § 13

18

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the Hawai 'i Constitution.11 Tscha does not challenge, however, 
the Circuit Court's authority to impose CAAP sanctions or the

applicability of the $10,000 CLD to this case; nor does she

allege that the amount of the CAAP sanctions actually imposed was

inherently excessive. Instead, she argues that because she was,
 
in effect, subjected to a negative judgment, and then sanctioned

under the CAAP rules, the court's ruling unconstitutionally

burdened her right to a jury trial.

In the seminal case regarding CAAP sanctions, the

supreme court explained the purpose behind HAR 26 as follows:

[Hawai'i's] legislature statutorily codified the CAAP as a
means to reduce the delay and costs involved in protracted
litigation by "provid[ing] for a procedure to obtain promptand equitable resolution of certain civil actions in tortthrough arbitration." HRS § 601–20(a) (Supp. 1992); HAR2(A); Spec. Comm. Rep. No. S5–86, in 1986 Senate JournalSpecial Session, at 29. At the same time, the supreme courtwas delegated the authority to adopt rules to implement theCAAP. HRS § 601–20(a). In doing so, this court promulgatedHAR 26 to enforce the objectives of the CAAP 
. . . 
 
Thus, HAR 26 sanctions may be imposed to penalize a
non-prevailing party whose decision to appeal the
arbitration award and pursue a trial de novo was

unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case,
albeit grounded to some degree in law or fact.

Accordingly, based on the plain language of the rule,
we hold that, when the circuit court's decision to impose
HAR 26 sanctions is challenged on appeal, the only relevant
inquiries are: (1) whether the party against whom the
sanctions were imposed is a "non-prevailing party" in the
trial de novo; and (2) whether the decision to impose
sanctions constituted an abuse of discretion.

Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), 76 Hawai 'i 494, 510­
11, 880 P.2d 169, 185-86 (1994) (emphasis added, footnote

omitted). 
 
11

Article I, § 13 of the Constitution of the State of Hawai' i 
provides: 
In suits at common law where the value in controversy
shall exceed five thousand dollars, the right of trial by
jury shall be preserved. The legislature may provide for a
verdict by not less than three-fourths of the members of the
jury.

Haw. Const. art. I, § 13.

19

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
20In Richardson,  the plaintiffs challenged the
constitutionality of the $5,000 CAAP sanction, arguing that the
imposition of the sanction violated their right to a civil jury
trial under article I, § 13 of the Hawai #i Constitution.  The
supreme court noted that the right to a civil jury trial in
article I, § 13 of the Hawai# i Constitution could be subject to
"reasonable conditions on its exercise."  Id.  at 513, 880 P.2d at
188.  The supreme court held that "if HAR 26 serves a legitimate
purpose and does not impermissibly burden the [plaintiff's] civil
jury trial right, there is no violation of due process or article
I, § 13."  Id. at 514, 880 P.2d at 189.  It reasoned:
First, HAR 26 sanctions are available only if the
appealing party does not improve its position, at the
present time, by 15% or more, and even then, sanctions are
discretionary.  Accordingly, every party has the ability to
avoid HAR 26 sanctions by undertaking a frank
post-arbitration evaluation of the merits of their case.
Second, the potential magnitude of the sanction is not
per se unreasonable.  Sanctions are presently limited to
$5,000.00 in attorneys' fees plus actual "costs" as that
term is defined.  Many courts have upheld similar or greater
potential sanctions as reasonable.
Id. at 514-15, 880 P.2d at 189-90 (footnote omitted).
However, the supreme court clarified that 
  although the amount of sanctions authorized by HAR 26 is not
per se unconstitutional, "the problem is one of degree
rather than kind."  Christie–Lambert, 39 Wash.App. at 307,
693 P.2d at 167.  For example, as the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has noted with regard to a court rule requiring the
payment of arbitrators' fees as a condition to
post-arbitration jury trial:
[T]he necessity of paying [$75 in arbitrators' fees]
as the condition for the right to appeal [from a
mandatory arbitration award] would seemingly operate
as a strong deterrent, amounting practically to a
denial of that right, if the case should involve only
. . . as little as $250.
Application of Smith, 381 Pa. at 232, 112 A.2d at 630. 
Thus, the amount of sanctions imposed in a given case must
not be so disproportionate to the amount in controversy so
as to operate as a practical denial of the right to a jury
trial in civil cases.
Id. at 515, 880 P.2d at 190.
Applying this standard to the plaintiffs' claims in
Richardson,  the supreme court compared the approximate amount in
controversy (between $60,441.80, the arbitration award, andNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
21$150,000, the amount demanded by the plaintiffs in their
settlement conference statement) with the $5,234.41 sanction the
trial court imposed and held that "[a]lthough no fixed lines can
be drawn, we do not believe the $5,234.41 sanction was
unreasonable."  Id. (citation and footnote omitted).  Thus, the
court held that
[w]hen considering the important interests that HAR 26
serves and the limits placed on its use, we cannot say that
HAR 26 imposed an unreasonable burden on the [plaintiffs']
right to a civil jury trial.  Therefore, we conclude that
the sanctions awarded in this case did not violate due
process or article I, § 13.
Id.
Tscha argues that, in this case, the justification for
imposing a sanction on her is less compelling than it was in
Richardson because CAAP Rule 28 now provides a better,
alternative method for ensuring meaningful participation in the
CAAP program.  Thus, she submits, "[t]he present-day CAAP
sanction scheme as imposed on motor vehicle accident victims such
as Ms. Tscha is unconstitutional under the  Richardson court's
reasoning."  Specifically, Tscha argues that:  (1) the maximum
attorneys' fee sanction allowed under HAR 26 has increased from
$5,000 to $15,000 since Richardson was decided; (2) the chance
that an injured plaintiff will be compelled to pay a sanction has
been substantially increased because HAR 25 has been amended so
that a plaintiff who seeks a trial de novo must improve upon
their arbitration award by at least 30 percent in order to be a
"prevailing party" compared to 15 percent under the version of
the rule that was in effect when Richardson was decided; (3) "the
rules now make clear that the CAAP definition of prevailing party
applies to the award of costs under the Rules of Civil Procedure,
so an injured party who would otherwise be considered
'prevailing' under the Civil Rules will not be reimbursed for
their costs and can be made to pay the losing defendant's taxable
costs"; and (4) the  Richardson court did not take into accountNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the CLD will apply under HRS § 431:10C-301.512
 to depress
 
the size of an award and "reduce the amount in controversy to a

level that makes the risk of the sanction to [sic] great to

bear."

Tscha cites no precedent or legislative history to

support her arguments that following the enactment of HAR 28,13

HAR 26 sanctions are no longer needed. Furthermore, HAR 28
 
plainly states that sanctions imposed under HAR 28 "are

independent of the sanctions under Rule 26."

Tscha gives short shrift to the purpose of HAR 26 
sanctions, which is "to penalize a non-prevailing party whose decision to appeal the arbitration award and pursue a trial de novo was unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case[.]" Moniz v. Freitas, 79 Hawai
'i 495, 499, 904 P.2d 509, 
513 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In the instant case, the Arbitrator awarded Tscha $20,000 in special damages, $15,000 in general damages, and costs of $862.06, but also reduced the total damages by the $10,000 CLD for a net award of $25,862.06. Tscha rejected the Arbitrator's award, made a settlement demand of $1.25 million, and then sought $465,500 in damages in a trial de novo. The jury awarded $6,500 in damages, 
12 We note that HRS § 431:10C–301.5, which established the CLD, was
enacted in 1997 and effective January 1, 1998, after Richardson was decided in
1994. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Gepaya, 103 Hawai' i 142, 146, 80
P.3d 321, 325 (2003). 
13 HAR 28 provides:

Rule 28. SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO MEANINGFULLY

PARTICIPATE IN ARBITRATION HEARING.

The Arbitration Judge, on the motion of any party
filed and served within thirty (30) days after the
arbitration award is served upon the parties by the
Arbitration Administrator, shall have the power to award
sanctions against any party or attorney for failure to
participate in the arbitration hearing in a meaningful
manner. Sanctions may include costs, expert fees and
attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by all other parties for
the arbitration hearing and in the prosecution of the motion
for sanctions. These sanctions are independent of sanctions
under Rule 26. The court may hold hearings as deemed
appropriate. If the court determines that the motion was

brought without good cause, it may award costs and attorney
fees against the movant.

22

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and the Circuit Court reduced that award by the $10,000 CLD for a

net award of $0. 
 
In light of the above, and given that the amount in 
controversy was arguably between $25,862.06 (the net arbitration award) and the $465,000 Tscha sought at trial, (or arguably the $1.25 million she demanded to settle the claim before trial), we cannot conclude that the $10,000 in CAAP sanctions the Circuit Court imposed under HAR 26 was "so disproportionate to the amount in controversy so as to operate as a practical denial of the right to a jury trial in civil cases." Richardson, 76 Hawai
'i at 
515, 880 P.2d at 190. Thus, the sanctions did not violate Tscha's right to a jury trial under article I, § 13 of the Hawai
'i Constitution, and the Circuit Court did not abuse its 
discretion in awarding the sanctions, notwithstanding the application of the CLD.
