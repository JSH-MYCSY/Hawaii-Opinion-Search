APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NOS. AB 2008-213 (9-04-10016);

ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Claimant-Appellant
 
Allan J. Zachary (Zachary) because it was untimely.

Pursuant to HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2011)  and HRS § 91­
2
14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011),  an aggrieved party may appeal a final
decision and order by LIRAB directly to the intermediate court of
 appeals.
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals in
administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes judicial
review of a final decision and order in a contested case or a
 preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief. For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined
"final order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89
 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The supreme court has "held
 that an order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under
 the worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under
 HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo
 
Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai' i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 
(2004) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Under Lindinha, the
 LIRAB's November 14, 2012 Decision and Order is a final
 appealable order under HRS § 91-14(a) and HRS § 386-88.
 
1 "The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final and
conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless within thirty days
after mailing of a certified copy of the decision or order, the director or
any other party appeals to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate board."
HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2011) (in part).
 
2HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) provides:
 
§ 91-14. Judicial review of contested cases.
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested
case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of adequate
relief is entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter; but nothing
in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of review,
redress, relief, or trial de novo, including the right of trial by jury,
provided by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term "person aggrieved" shall
include an agency that is a party to a contested case proceeding before that
agency or another agency.

However, the appeal was untimely under Rule 4(a) of the
 
Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). "When a civil appeal
 
is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within
 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." HRAP
 Rule 4(a). 
The general rule is that where a judgment is amended
in a material and substantial respect, the time within
which an appeal from such determination may be taken
begins to run from the date of the amendment, although
where the amendment relates only to the correction of
a clerical error, it does not affect the time allowed
for appeal.
 
Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Board, 98 Hawai' i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis
 
points omitted; emphasis added); State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i 
235, 246 n.6, 178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 (2008). Furthermore,
 
[i]f the amendment of a final judgment or decree for the
purpose of correcting a clerical error either materially
alters rights or obligations determined by the prior
judgment or decree or creates a right of appeal where one
did not exist before, the time for appeal should be measured
from the entry of the amended judgment. If, however, the
amendment has neither of these results, but instead makes
changes in the prior judgment which have no adverse effect
upon those rights or obligations or the parties’ right to
appeal, the entry of the amended judgment will not postpone
the time within which an appeal must be taken from the
original decree.

brackets omitted; emphasis added).
 
The November 20, 2012 Amended Decision and Order which
 
Zachary appeals from modified a November 14, 2012 Decision and
 Order as follows:
 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 386-87(d)
and Rule Section 12-47-54 of the LAB Rules of Practice
 and Procedure, the Board shall amend and hereby amends
the November 14, 2012 Decision and Orde rto correct
the paragraph on page 6 immediately preceding

"FINDINGS OF FACT" so that it now reads:
 
"For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms,
in part, and modifies, in part, the Director's
 decisions dated October 4, 2007; October 19, 2007; and
June 16, 2011."
 
All other provisions of the Decision and Order are not
affected by the foregoing amendment and shall remain
in effect. (bold in original)
 
The change had no adverse effect upon the November 14,
 
2012 Decision and Order and merely added the words "in part, and
 
modifies, in part." Therefore, the time to appeal under HRAP
 Rule 4(a) began on November 14, 2012. Zacahry did not file an
 appeal until December 18, 2012. Zachary did not file a notice of
 appeal within 30 days from the date of the final appealable order
 dated November 14, 2012. Accordingly, the court lacks appellate
 jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
