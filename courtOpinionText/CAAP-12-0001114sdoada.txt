NO. CAAP-12-0001114
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LAST KONY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-1294)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J. and Fujise, J.,
with Reifurth, J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Last Kony (Kony) appeals from the
 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(Circuit Court)  on November 28, 2012 in which Kony was convicted
of and sentenced for three counts of Sexual Assault in the First
 
Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707­730(1)(c) (Supp. 2013), and three counts of Sexual Assault in the
 Third Degree in violation of HRS § 707-732(1)(c) (Supp. 2013).
 
On appeal, Kony argues that the Circuit Court erred by 
allowing the State of Hawai 'i's (the State) expert to testify 
where his testimony was: (1) not relevant; (2) did not assist the jury in comprehending something not commonly known or understood; (3) improperly bolstered the complaining witness's testimony; and (4) improperly profiled him as a sex offender or alternatively, was misleading and highly prejudicial. 
After a careful review of the points raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the applicable authority and the
 record, we resolve Kony's point on appeal as follows and affirm.

"Generally, the decision whether to admit expert 
testimony rests in the discretion of the trial court. To the 
extent that the trial court's decision is dependant upon interpretation of court rules, such interpretation is a question of law, which [the appellate] court reviews de novo." Barcai v. 
Betwee, 98 Hawai
'i 470, 479, 50 P.3d 946, 955 (2002) (internal 
citations omitted). 
Here, Kony filed a Motion in Limine that sought to
 
preclude Dr. Alex Bivens (Dr. Bivens) from testifying for the
 prosecution on the basis that his testimony was not relevant.

The Circuit Court held a hearing on Kony's motion and determined
 that Dr. Bivens would be allowed to testify on the issue of
 delayed reporting, with any other areas of testimony to be
 determined on a "question by question" objection basis.
 
1. and 2. Kony argues that Dr. Bivens's testimony did
 
not comport with Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 7023
 and
therefore "failed to meet the requirements for admissibility of
 expert testimony[.]" 
He argues that contrary to the State's
 
representation that the testimony would only address the issue of
 delayed reporting, Dr. Bivens instead gave a "discourse that
 simply regurgitated ad nauseum external statistics and case
 studies" and "did not make the ultimate question in this
 case . . . more or less probable[.]" In particular, Kony argues
 that because Dr. Bivens's "testimony did not satisfy the four-
pronged Batangan inquiry, the court erred in allowing him to
 testify and [Kony's] convictions must be vacated and the case
 
2 At trial, the Circuit Court ruled that Dr. Bivens was qualified to
testify "as an expert in clinical psychology with an emphasis on the dynamics
of child sexual abuse[.]" The defense stated it had no objections to Dr.
Bivens's qualification.

 HRE Rule 702 states:
 
If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge
will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or
 to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an
expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or
otherwise. In determining the issue of assistance to the
trier of fact, the court may consider the trustworthiness
and validity of the scientific technique or mode of analysis
employed by the proffered expert.

remanded for a new trial." (citing State v. Batangan, 71 Haw.
 
552, 562, 799 P.2d 48, 54 (1990)).
 
Kony acknowledges that the standard for admissibility 
of expert testimony in child sex abuse cases, including the requirement that the testimony be "relevant" and "shown to assist the jury to comprehend something not commonly known or understood" was established in Batangan, 71 Haw. at 562, 799 P.2d at 54, but argues that "Batangan, presented distinct factual circumstances, and was decided during a wholly different social, political, and technological era." However, this court has rejected this notion and has sustained the presentation of such testimony in the recent past. See State v. Transfiguracion, 128 
Hawai
'i 476, 290 P.3d 546, No. CAAP-11-0000048, 2012 WL 5897413 
at *2, (App. Nov. 21, 2012)(SDO) ("[E]ven if the circuit court were to credit Transfiguracion's unsubstantiated assertion that the news and entertainment media depict child sex abuse and delayed reporting on a regular basis, it does not necessarily follow that there has been any change in the public's understanding of the psychological effects of childhood sexual abuse.") cert. rejected, No. SCWC-11-0000048, 2013 WL 1285112 (Mar. 28, 2013); see also State v. Moisa, 126 Hawai
'i 266, 269 
P.3d 801, No. 30712, 2012 WL 247963 at *2, (App. Jan. 25, 2012)(SDO), cert. rejected, No. SCWC-30712, 2012 WL 1419552 (Apr. 24, 2012). 
3. and 4. Kony argues that Dr. Bivens's testimony
 
improperly bolstered the complaining witness's testimony and
 profiled Kony as a sex offender which was misleading and highly
 prejudicial. Assuming, arguendo, that Kony properly preserved
 these objections, we reject them as without merit.
 
Kony admits that "Dr. Bivens did not have any
 
information about the case, including [the complaining witness's]
 age and the relationship between" complaining witness and Kony
 and "did not explicitly state that he believed that abuse
 occurred or that [the complaining witness] was truthful," but
 argues that "the statistical and profile evidence that he cited
 had essentially the same effect" as to have "vouched for" the
 complaining witness's testimony.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The record does not support this assertion. Dr. Bivens
 
stated that he understood that the purpose of his testimony was
 
"to provide information to the jury about the nature of child
 sexual abuse and, um, hopefully that will assist the jury in
 making their own determination about the facts of this case." 
He also testified that, with regard to the numbers he presented,
 "there are error rates associated with percentages always" and
 "[p]ercentages should only be used to be given a general idea[.]"
 
There is no categorical prohibition on this kind of
 
testimony, even when the expert has examined the complaining
 witness and knows about the facts of the case. Batangan 71 Haw.
 
at 558, 799 P.2d at 52 (While "this type of expert testimony
 carries the potential of bolstering the credibility of one
 witness and conversely refuting the credibility of another[,]
 . . . [s]uch testimony, by itself, does not render the evidence
 inadmissible."). By contrast, "conclusory opinions that abuse
 did occur and that the child victim's report of abuse is truthful
 and believable is of no assistance to the jury, and therefore,
 should not be admitted." Id. Neither case specific nor
 
conclusory testimony was given here.
 
Kony argues that Dr. Bivens's "testimony on 'profile'
 
evidence of the typical sex abuser and victim of sexual abuse
 and/or use of statistics to substantiate his claims was highly
 prejudicial." He argues that "[w]hile [Dr.] Bivens did not
 explicitly state that he believed that abuse occurred or that
 [the complaining witness] was truthful, the statistical and
 profile evidence that he cited had essentially the same effect.
 
Dr. Bivens additionally testified about the "abuse
 
process" and how child molesters "approach their crime" in such a
 way that is "designed to keep the child quiet and keep them from
 telling." In particular, Dr. Bivens testified about the "classic
 example" of "taking advantage of children while in a vulnerable
 position" being "approaching a sleeping child." As this
 description closely matched the complaining witness's account,
 Kony argues that the testimony amounted to Dr. Bivens "directly
 opining on the truthfulness of the complaining witness[.]"
 (quoting Batangan, 71 Haw. at 559, 799 P.2d at 52) (citation and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
internal quotation marks omitted). According to Kony, this
 
"'guide[d] the jury to a conclusion' that [the complaining
 witness] was telling the truth by demonstrating that the details
 or characteristics of her testimony matched those of a typical
 sexual abuse case, even though fabricated testimony could also
 include such details."
 
While acknowledging the possible dangers of such 
testimony, Hawai
'i courts have consistently held that Dr. 
Bivens's generalized testimony "was helpful to the jury and relevant to provide context to evaluate the behavior of the Child where normal indicia of reliability may not apply." State v. Pacheco, 128 Hawai
'i 447, 290 P.3d 547, No. CAAP-11-0000571, 2012 
WL 5990275 at *1 (App. Nov. 30, 2012)(SDO), cert. rejected, No. CAAP-11-0000571, 2013 WL 1580861 (Apr. 15, 2013) (quoting Batangan at 557-58, 799 P.2d at 52) ("Expert testimony exposing jurors to the unique interpersonal dynamics involved in prosecutions for intrafamily child sexual abuse, may play a particularly useful role by disabusing the jury of some widely held misconceptions . . . so that it may evaluate the evidence free of the constraints of popular myths.") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also Transfiguracion, 128 Hawai
'i 476, 290 P.3d 546, No. CAAP-11-0000048, 2012 WL 5897413 
at *1 (App. Nov. 21, 2012)(SDO). 
Finally, the Circuit Court included a jury instruction
 
that advised the jury that it could choose not to accept the
 expert's testimony. That instruction read:
 
During the trial you heard the testimony of one or
more witnesses who were described as experts.
 
Training and experience may make a person an expert in
a particular field. The law allows that person to state an
opinion about matters in that field. Merely because such a
witness has expressed an opinion does not mean, however,
that you must accept this opinion. It is up to you to decide
whether to accept this testimony and how much weight to give
it. You must also decide whether the witness's opinions were
based on sound reasons, judgment, and information.
 
The trial judge is in the best position to evaluate and
 
make a determination on the admission of evidence. On this

record, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in allowing the testimony at issue.
 
Therefore, November 28, 2012 Judgment of Conviction and
 
Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
