NO. CAAP-12-0001115 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ALVAH L. RUIS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-245K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Alvah L. Ruis (Ruis) appeals from 
the "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order" entered 
November 7, 2012 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit1 
(circuit court), denying his Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief (Rule 40 
Petition). 
2
On appeal,  Ruis contends that certain findings by the
circuit court were clearly erroneous and certain conclusions were
 
wrong when the court denied his Rule 40 Petition because newly
 discovered evidence justified relief from conviction, and he
 received ineffective assistance of counsel.

 While the circuit court extended the due date for filing an appeal
without an express finding of "good cause" per Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure Rule 4(b)(5), our jurisdiction is proper under the "unique
circumstances" doctrine. See Cabral v. State, 127 Hawai' i 175, 184, 277 P.3d
269, 278 (2012) (appellate jurisdiction proper where motion for an extensionof time was filed before the original deadline expired, the deadline wasextended, and the extension was later deemed invalid). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Ruis's
 appeal is without merit.
 
On June 20, 2012, Ruis filed his Rule 40 Petition
 
asserting a letter from the primary complaining witness (CW)
 
justified relief from conviction. Ruis contends CW's letter was
 
newly discovered evidence sufficient for relief from conviction
 under HRPP Rule 40(a)(1)(iv).
3 Ruis also contends he was denied
 
effective assistance of counsel, requiring relief from conviction
 under HRPP Rule 40(a)(1)(i).
 
In reviewing the circuit court's disposition of the 
Rule 40 Petition, we review the circuit court's findings of fact for clear error and the conclusions of law de novo. Coulter v. 
State, 116 Hawaii 181, 184, 172 P.3d 493, 496 (2007). Moreover, "[t]he granting or denial of a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion." State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai
'i 
60, 69-70, 148 P.3d 493, 502-03 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citation omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregards

 HRPP Rule 40(a)(1) sets out the five grounds on which relief may
be sought:
 
Rule 40. POST-CONVICTION PROCEEDING.
 
(a) Proceedings and grounds.
 
. . . .
 
(i) that the judgment was obtained or sentence imposed in
violation of the constitution of the United States or of the State 
of Hawai' i; 
(ii) that the court which rendered the judgment was without
jurisdiction over the person or the subject matter;
 
(iii) that the sentence is illegal;
 
(iv) that there is newly discovered evidence; or
 
(v) any ground which is a basis for collateral attack on
the judgment.

rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
 
detriment of a party litigant. See id.
 
A motion for a new trial based on newly discovered
 
evidence will only be granted if the defendant proves: (1) the
 evidence has been discovered after trial; (2) such evidence could
 not have been discovered before or at trial through the exercise
 of due diligence; (3) the evidence is material to the issues and
 not cumulative or offered solely for purposes of impeachment; and
 (4) the evidence is of such a nature as would probably change the result of a later trial. See State v. McNulty, 60 Haw. 259, 588 
P.2d 438 (1978), overruled on other grounds by Raines v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 219, 900 P.2d 1286 (1995). A criminal defendant bears 
the burden of proof on all these requirements. See United States 
v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1357, 1364 (6th Cir. 1993) (analyzing Federal
 Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 33, which in pertinent part is
 substantially similar to HRPP Rule 33).
 
In denying Ruis's Rule 40 Petition, the circuit court
 
found that: (1) the former counsel listed the letter as an
 exhibit for trial; (2) the former counsel credibly testified that
 he discussed with Ruis the substance of the letter and its
 relation to possible defenses; and (3) the CW credibly testified
 that Ruis dictated the letter to her. The circuit court thus
 concluded the letter was discovered before the change of plea
 hearing and that Ruis failed to satisfy the first prong required
 for granting a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The
 circuit court's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and
 the conclusions of law were not wrong, and the circuit court did
 not abuse its discretion in denying Ruis's Rule 40 Petition
 seeking a new trial.
 
Ruis's ineffective assistance of counsel claim
 
similarly fails. Ruis was required to establish: (1) that there
 were specific errors or omissions reflecting his counsel's lack
 of skill, judgment, or diligence, and (2) that such errors or
 omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial
 impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. State v.
 
Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348-49, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980).

Ruis contended his former counsel provided ineffective 
assistance of counsel by failing to review the subject letter 
with him before his change of plea hearing. Since his former counsel said he received the letter, discussed its relative importance with Ruis, and intended to use the letter at trial, the circuit court, in denying Ruis's Rule 40 Petition, concluded Ruis failed to show a lack of skill, judgment, or diligence on the part of former counsel that would affect a potentially meritorious defense. These findings and conclusions of the circuit court were not erroneous. Coulter, 116 Hawai
'i at 184, 
172 P.3d at 496. 
Ruis's former counsel testified he considered the
 
letter in his trial preparation, listed it as an exhibit, and
 discussed with Ruis its relative importance. The circuit court
 relied on testimony from the CW and former counsel. And, Ruis
 himself testified he "was aware that [CW] had changed her
 statement."
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law; Order" entered November 7, 2012 in the
 Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
