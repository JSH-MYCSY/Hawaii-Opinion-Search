ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack jurisdiction over Intervenors-Appellants Sandwich Isles
 
Communications, Inc., and Pa Makani, LLC's (collectively
 Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani), appeal
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from the following two orders that Appellee State of Hawai' i 
1
Public Utilities Commission (the PUC)  entered in an
administrative proceeding in Docket No. 2012-0084:
 
(1)	 a September 7, 2012 order dismissing Appellants
Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani's motion
 to intervene in the PUC's administrative proceeding
(hereinafter "the September 7, 2012 order denying
intervention”), and
 
(2)	 a November 27, 2012 order denying Appellants Sandwich
Isles Communications and Pa Makani's motion for
 reconsideration of the September 7, 2012 order denying
intervention (hereinafter the “November 27, 2012 order
denying reconsideration”).
 
We initially note that Applicant-Appellee Coral
 
Wireless, LLC, dba Mobi PCS (Appellee Coral Wireless) initiated
 
the administrative proceeding by filing an application with the
 PUC for annual certification as an eligible telecommunications
 carrier pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 54.314 (2012). Subsection (a) of
 47 C.F.R. § 54.314 provides:
 
§ 54.314 Certification of support for eligible
telecommunications carriers.
 (a) Certification. States that desire eligible
telecommunications carriers to receive support pursuant to
the high-cost program must file an annual certification with
the Administrator and the Commission stating that all
federal high-cost support provided to such carriers within
that State was used in the preceding calendar year and will
be used in the coming calendar year only for the provision,
maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for
which the support is intended. High-cost support shall only
be provided to the extent that the State has filed the
requisite certification pursuant to this section.
 
(Emphasis added). Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and
 
Pa Makani filed a motion to intervene in this PUC administrative
 proceeding for Appellee Coral Wireless's application, which
 resulted in the PUC entering the September 7, 2012 order denying
 intervention. The PUC eventually ended the administrative

-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceeding by entering a September 10, 2012 decision and order 
approving Appellee Coral Wireless's application. As non-parties, Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani are appealing from the September 7, 2012 order denying intervention. Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani additionally seek appellate review of the November 27, 2012 order denying reconsideration pursuant to Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). See HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) ("The 
notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or order."). 
Administrative appeals commence in a circuit court 
"except where a statute provides for a direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court[.]" HRS § 91-14(b) (1993 & Supp. 2012). "Matters relating to the PUC are governed by HRS ch. 269." Peterson v. Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 
Hawai'i 322, 327, 944 P.2d 1265, 1270 (1997), superseded on other 
grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp. 1999). HRS § 269-15.5 (2007) authorizes an aggrieved person to appeal from certain final orders of the PUC directly to the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals: 
§ 269-15.5. Appeals.
An appeal from an order of the public utilities
commission under this chapter shall lie subject to chapter
602, in the manner provided for civil appeals from the
circuit courts. Only a person aggrieved in a contested case
proceeding provided for in this chapter may appeal from the
order, if the order is final, or if preliminary, is of the
nature defined by section 91-14(a). The commission may
elect to be a party to all matters from which an order of
the commission is appealed, and the commission may file
appropriate responsive briefs or pleadings in the appeal;
provided that where there was no adverse party in the case
below, or in cases where there is no adverse party to the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
appeal, the commission shall be a party to all matters in
which an order of the commission is appealed and shall file
the appropriate responsive briefs or pleadings in defending
all such orders. The appearance of the commission as a
party in appellate proceedings in no way limits the
participation of persons otherwise qualified to be parties
on appeal. The appeal shall not of itself stay the
operation of the order appealed from, but the appellate
court may stay the order after a hearing upon a motion
therefor and may impose conditions it deems proper,
including but not limited to requiring a bond, requiring
that accounts be kept, or requiring that other measures be
taken as ordered to secure restitution of the excess
 charges, if any, made during the pendency of the appeal, in
case the order appealed from is sustained, reversed, or
modified in whole or in part.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
In circuit court cases, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i 
has held that "[a]n order denying an application for intervention 
under HRCP Rule 24 is a final appealable order under HRS § 641­1(a)." Hoopai v. Civil Service Commission, 106 Hawai' i 205, 215, 
103 P.3d 365, 375 (2004) (citation omitted). "The appealability of such an order is based upon the collateral order doctrine." Id. (citation omitted). In the instant case, Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani are not appealing from a circuit court case pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), but, instead, Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani are appealing from a PUC proceeding directly to the Hawai' i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals pursuant to HRS § 269-15.5, which specifically provides that "[o]nly a person aggrieved in a contested case proceeding provided for in this chapter may appeal from the order, if the order is final, or if preliminary, is of the nature defined by section 91-14(a)." (Emphasis added). A contested case is "a proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing." HRS 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 91-1(5) (1993) (emphases added). Thus, the Supreme Court of 
Hawai'i has held that, 
[i]f the statute or rule governing the activity in
question does not mandate a hearing prior to the
administrative agency's decision-making, the actions of the
administrative agency are not required by law and do not
amount to a final decision or order in a contested case from
 which a direct appeal to circuit court is possible.
 
Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Commission, 76 Hawai' i 128, 134, 870 P.2d 
1272, 1278 (1994) (citations and internal quotation marks
 
omitted). When a statute limits administrative appeals from
 final orders that an administrative agency enters in a contested
 case,
 
in order for proceedings before an agency to constitute a
contested case from which an appeal can be maintained, the
agency must be required by law to hold a hearing before a
decision is rendered. Stated differently, discretionary
hearings are not contested cases because they are not
required by law.
 
Lingle v. Hawaii Government Employees Association, 107 Hawai' i 
178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 (2005) (citation omitted; emphases
 
added). Thus, for example, we dismissed an administrative appeal
 directly from the PUC as to an order dismissing a petition for
 declaratory relief, because no statute or rule required the PUC
 to hold a hearing on the petition for declaratory relief, and,
 thus, the administrative proceeding did not qualify as a
 contested case, and, consequently, HRS § 269-15.5 did not
 authorize an appeal from the PUC's dismissal order directly to
 the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals: 
PUC issued its Dismissal Order pursuant to HRS § 91–8
(1993) and HAR §§ 6–61–159, 6–61–162, and 6–61–164 (1992).
The administrative rules establish that a hearing on a
petition for a declaratory ruling is a discretionary hearing
and, therefore, not a contested case. HAR § 6–61–159
provides that an interested person may petition PUC to issue
a declaratory order. Pursuant to HAR § 6–61–162, PUC may
deny the petition, issue a declaratory order, or set the
matter for hearing. HAR § 6–61–164 provides examples of
reasons why PUC may deny the petition or refuse to issue a
 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
declaratory order. Because a hearing on a petition for a
declaratory order before PUC is discretionary and notrequired by law, the Dismissal Order was not a contestedcase. Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 184, 111 P.3d at 593.
Accordingly, because HRS § 269–15.5 only applies tocontested cases, Tawhiri Power was not entitled to appealthe Dismissal Order directly to this court.
Tawhiri Power should have filed an appeal to the
circuit court pursuant to HRS §§ 91–8 and 91–14. In Lingle, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that "orders disposing of
petitions for declaratory rulings under HRS § 91–8 areappealable to the circuit court pursuant to HRS § 91–14."Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 186, 111 P.3d at 595.
Because Tawhiri Power did not have the right to appeal
directly to this court, we lack jurisdiction over Tawhiri
Power's appeal.
 
In re Tawhiri Power LLC, 126 Hawai' i 242, 245-46, 269 P.3d 777, 
780-81 (App. 2012) (footnotes omitted). 
In the instant case, none of the parties have cited to 
any statute or rule that required the PUC to hold any hearing on 
Appellee Coral Wireless's application. Similar to the circumstances in In re Tawhiri Power LLC, because no statute or rule appears to have required the PUC to hold a hearing on Appellee Coral Wireless's application, the proceedings for Appellee Coral Wireless's application do not constitute a contested case. Therefore, because HRS § 269–15.5 only authorizes appeals from contested cases, Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani are not entitled to appeal directly to the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals from the 
September 7, 2012 order denying intervention or the November 27, 2012 order denying reconsideration. Absent an appealable order, we lack jurisdiction over Appellants Sandwich Isles Communications and Pa Makani's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-12-0001119. Accordingly, 
-6­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
CAAP-12-0001119 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
