STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NEIL BARNETT, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-12-02614)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 Defendant-Appellant Neil Barnett appeals from the
 
"Amended Judgment and Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment" filed
 
on October 30, 2012 in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 North and South Kona Division ("District Court").
1/ Following a
 
bench trial, Barnett was found guilty of Operating a Vehicle
 Under the Influence of an Intoxicant ("OVUII"), in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2011).
2/
 
Barnett's conviction arises out of an incident
 
occurring on August 16, 2012 at approximately 3:00 a.m., after
 
1/ The Honorable David K. Kuwahara presided. 
2/ That statute states, in relevant part, that: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred
ten liters of breath[.]
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291E-61(a)(3).
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i County Police Department ("HCPD") Officer Derek Kenison, 
Jr. spotted Barnett's vehicle stalled in the southbound roadway 
on Queen Kaahumanu Highway in Kona. It is undisputed that Barnett was the vehicle's sole occupant, and that Barnett was intoxicated with a breath alcohol content of 0.205. The remaining facts derive from four witnesses who testified at Barnett's October 30, 2012 trial: Barnett, Officer Kenison, and his fellow HCPD officers, Sheldon Nakamoto and Steven J. Burkey. 
According to Barnett, he had been driving home at
 
approximately 11:45 p.m. on August 15, 2012, when his vehicle ran
 out of gas and stalled. Barnett "thought [the vehicle was]
 sufficiently pushed off to the shoulder" of the road, so he left
 it to walk to a gas station. After finding that neither of the
 two stations he allegedly visited had portable gas containers for
 purchase, Barnett claims that he "gave up" and "met some friends
 at Sam's Hideaway," a local bar. Although he testified that he
 "had already locked the car," Barnett claims that he returned to
 the vehicle at approximately 2:30 a.m. on August 16 to confirm
 that his valuables were secured and to "push [the vehicle]
 further off to the side" of the road. 
When Officer Kenison arrived on the scene at
 
approximately 3:00 a.m. on August 16, he found Barnett sitting in
 the driver's seat of his vehicle, which was "parked in the middle
 of the southbound roadway, lights on, kind of at a different
 angle other than lane of travel," and the driver's side door was
 open. Officer Kenison stated that although he asked Barnett if
 he needed help moving the vehicle out of the road, Barnett
 declined assistance and asked instead "if it would be okay for
 him to walk to a gas station[,]" to which Officer Kenison replied
 "that as long as [Barnett] moved his vehicle, then yeah." 
Officer Kenison only remained with Barnett for a few minutes
 because he was in the process of transporting a prisoner, so
 Officer Kenison dispatched Barnett's location on his police radio
 and left. The next to arrive at the scene was Officer Nakamoto,
 who reached Barnett approximately three minutes after he heard
 Officer Kenison's dispatch. Officer Nakamoto found Barnett
 standing behind his vehicle, trying to push it. Finally, Officer
 
2
   
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Burkey arrived at approximately 3:20 a.m. Officer Burkey
 
detected alcohol on Barnett's breath. After administering
 several field sobriety tests, which Barnett failed, the officers
 arrested Barnett for OVUII.
 
At Barnett's bench trial, the parties disagreed about
 
whether the State could demonstrate that Barnett actually took
 physical control of the vehicle while he was intoxicated. In
 finding Barnett guilty, the District Court specifically stated
 that it "ha[d] a hard time believing th[e] scenario that the
 defendant testified to," and instead
 
believe[d] that it's more credible that what happened here was
that he drove it to where he said he drove it, that when it
ran out of gas, then the officers came upon the scene and made
the observations that they made. I don't believe that he left
 the scene, that he went and got intoxicated, and then returned
to the scene. So the Court is going to find that the state
has proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt[.]
 
Thereafter, Barnett filed a "Motion to Reconsider
 
Verdict or in the Alternative Motion for New Trial" ("Motion for
 
New Trial") "on the grounds that the verdict was against the
 weight [of] the evidence and that important evidence was not
 presented at the trial o[n] the matter." Following a December 6,
 2012 hearing, the District Court
3/ denied the Motion for New
 
Trial because it determined that defense counsel's decision not
 to call other witnesses at trial was strategic in nature, there
 was no proof that witnesses were, in fact, unavailable at the
 time of trial, and Barnett never requested a continuance. 
On appeal, Barnett contends that (1) there was
 
insufficient evidence that Barnett operated or assumed actual
 physical control of a vehicle, as required under HRS
 § 291E–61(a); (2) the District Court erred by denying Barnett's
 Motion for New Trial; and (3) he received ineffective assistance
 of counsel at trial because counsel failed to investigate
 witnesses who, Barnett contends, would have established his
 innocence. Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 
3/
 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo, Jr. presided over the Motion for
New Trial.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Barnett's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) Barnett first contends that there was insufficient 
evidence to convict him because the State failed to establish 
that he "operate[d] or assume[d] actual physical control of [his] vehicle" while under the influence of an intoxicant. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291E–61(a). Specifically, Barnett argues that "operate" means "to drive," and that "assumes actual physical control" means "the keys are in the ignition." We review this claim to determine whether the State presented "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion" of the trier of fact. State v. Griffin, 126 Hawai
'i 40, 56, 266 P.3d 448, 464 (App. 
2011) (quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 
1241 (1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that it did. 
Although each of the State's witnesses admitted that he 
did not personally observe Barnett driving his vehicle at any time, the OVUII statute does not require such a showing. For the purposes of HRS Chapter 291E, "'Operate' means to drive or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road or highway . . . ." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291E–1 (2007).
4/ The 
term "actual physical control" is not separately defined, but to give force to all the words in the HRS § 291E-1 definition of "operate," State v. Kalani, 108 Hawai
'i 279, 283–84, 118 P.3d 
1222, 1226–27 (2005) (citations omitted) ("[It is a maxim of statutory construction that] no clause, sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found which will give force to and preserve all words of the statute."), we find that "to assume actual physical control" necessarily has a different meaning than "to drive." See State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 392, 219 P.3d 
1170, 1179 (2009) (explaining that the phrase "assume actual physical control" refers to conduct "whether [it] consists of driving the vehicle or otherwise assuming actual physical control

 "'Public way, street, road, or highway' includes: (1) The entire
width, including berm or shoulder, of every road, alley, street, way, right of
way, lane, trail, highway, or bridge[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291E–1.

of it[,]" and concluding in n.11 that this interpretation is
 
consistent with the legislative history of HRS chapter 291E
 (citations omitted)); accord State v. Li, No. CAAP-12-0000626,
 2013 WL 6244724, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 29, 2013), cert.
 dismissed, No. SCWC-12-0000626, 2014 WL 943026 (Haw. Mar. 11,
 2014).
 
The trial court, to which we defer on issues of witness 
credibility, see In re Doe, 107 Hawai
'i 12, 19, 108 P.3d 966, 973 
(2005) ("The appellate courts will give due deference to the right of the trier of fact 'to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced.'" (quoting State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai
'i 429, 432, 866 
P.2d 766, 769 (App. 1994))), disbelieved Barnett's testimony that he left the stalled vehicle for several hours, consumed alcohol during that time, and then returned to it when the officers found him.
5/ Instead, the court credited testimony by the State's 
witnesses, each of whom stated that Barnett expressly told them that he was heading home when his vehicle ran out of gas. Barnett also admitted that he, personally, had been driving the vehicle when it stalled. And there is no dispute that when the police officers arrived, Barnett was intoxicated, and his breath alcohol content was 0.205, which exceeds the legal limit, Haw. 
Rev. Stat. § 291E–61(a)(3). 
When reviewing the record "in the strongest light for 
the prosecution" as we must when presented on appeal with a 
challenge to the sufficiency of evidence, State v. Lee, 90 Hawai
'i 130, 134, 976 P.2d 444, 448 (1999) (quoting State v. 
Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)), we find that there is substantial evidence upon which to conclude that Barnett operated the car while under the influence and to support Barnett's conviction. Indeed, upon approaching Barnett's vehicle, Officer Kenison observed that the headlights were 
5/
 This credibility determination is supported by Officer Burkey's
testimony that he traveled several times on Queen Kaahumanu Highway between
midnight on August 15 and 3:00 a.m. on August 16, 2012 and did not observe any
stalled vehicles.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
switched on and Barnett was sitting in the driver's seat.6/ 
Moreover, the fact that Barnett's vehicle was stalled on the road 
because it ran out of gas would explain why the motor was not running and nobody observed the keys in the ignition.  Thus, 
"even if it could be said . . . that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence," we find that there is credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value in the record to enable a person of reasonable caution to make "the requisite findings for conviction . . . ." State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 
131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 61 (1996) (quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai
'i 262, 265, 892 P.2d 455, 458 (1995)). Accordingly, 
Barnett's first point of error fails. 
(2) Barnett next contends that he "was entitled to a 
new trial because the new witness testimony would have corroborated his own testimony that he had not been under the influence of alcohol at the time he was actually operating the vehicle . . . [,]" and would thereby establish his innocence. In Hawai
'i, when a motion for a new trial is based on newly 
discovered evidence, it 
will only be granted if the defendant proves: [i] the evidence
has been discovered after trial; [ii] such evidence could not
have been discovered before or at trial through the exercise
of due diligence; [iii] the evidence is material to the issues
and not cumulative or offered solely for purposes of
 impeachment; and [iv] the evidence is of such a nature as
would probably change the result of a later trial.
 
State v. Ruis, No. CAAP-12-0001115, 2014 WL 1621780, at *1 (Haw. 
Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2014) (SDO) (citing State v. McNulty, 60 Haw. 259, 588 P.2d 438 (1978), overruled on other grounds by Raines v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 219, 900 P.2d 1286 (1995)). "A criminal 
defendant bears the burden of proof on all these requirements." Id. (citing United States v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1357, 1364 (6th Cir. 1993) (analyzing Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 33, which the court stated, in pertinent part, is substantially similar to Haw. R. Pen. P. Rule 33)). We hold that Barnett has not satisfied his burden, and, as such, the District Court did not abuse its

 At trial, Barnett explained that he was seated there because he
had to take the vehicle out of park to move it, but Barnett could not recall
whether he had to put the keys into the ignition to do so. He also stated
 that "[t]he keys were in [his] pocket."

discretion in failing to grant the Motion for New Trial. See 
State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai 'i 60, 69, 148 P.3d 493, 502 (2006) 
("'The granting or denial of a motion for new trial is within the 
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.'" (quoting State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai
'i 474, 478, 122 P.3d 254, 258 (2005) (brackets 
omitted)). 
Here, Barnett has not shown that there was newly
 
discovered evidence or that any such evidence could not have been
 discovered through the exercise of due diligence prior to trial,
 for "evidence known to defendant's counsel before or at trial
 does not constitute newly discovered evidence justifying new
 trial." McNulty, 60 Haw. at 268, 588 P.2d at 445. Moreover, the
 
Motion for New Trial included no witness affidavits as evidence
 of counsel's contentions, see King v. Makamaka, 7 Haw. 394, 395
 (Haw. Kingdom 1888) ("A motion for a new trial, based on newly
 discovered evidence, should be supported by the affidavits of the
 witnesses themselves, whom it is proposed to produce, unless good
 reason is shown why same cannot be produced."), and Barnett made
 "[n]o showing of any affirmative attempts to locate [alleged
 witnesses] before trial or to procure similar evidence" as an
 alternative. State v. Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 318, 615 P.2d 91,
 
97–98 (1980) (denying motion for a new trial where the only
 evidence supporting the motion was a new witness's affidavit and
 oral testimony, where there was no showing that the witness's
 evidence was new).
 
On these facts, we cannot find that "the trial court 
has 'clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregard[ed] rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.'" Hicks, 113 Hawai
'i at 69, 148 P.3d at 502 
(quoting Yamada, 108 Hawai 'i at 478, 122 P.3d at 258) (original 
brackets omitted). As such, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Motion for New Trial. 
(3) Finally, Barnett contends that his trial counsel
 
provided him with "ineffective assistance" by failing to call
 additional witnesses to support Barnett's version of events. 
Specifically, Barnett contends that "his trial attorney did not
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
call witnesses at trial who would have established [Barnett's] 
innocence, even though the attorney knew about the witnesses and knew the exonerating nature of the information the witnesses would have provided." However, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to investigate and obtain witness testimony "must be supported by affidavits or sworn statements describing the testimony of the proffered witnesses." Richie, 88 
Hawai
'i at 39, 960 P.2d at 1247. As noted above, however, 
Barnett's Motion for New Trial included no affidavits or sworn statements other than defense counsel's declaration, and our examination of the record on appeal reveals that it "lacks reliable evidence indicating what the [alleged new witness(es)] would have testified to." Id. Accordingly, Barnett's claim for 
ineffective assistance of trial counsel fails. Id. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended Judgment and
 
Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment, filed on October 30, 2012 in
 the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona
 Division, is affirmed.
