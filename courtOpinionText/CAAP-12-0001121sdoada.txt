IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RAYMOND S. DAVIS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO 1DTA-12-01623)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Raymond S. Davis (Davis) appeals
 
from the Order and Notice of Entry of Order, entered on
 
November 29, 2012 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division (District Court).
1 Davis was convicted of
 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII),
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 219E-61(a)(3)
 (Supp. 2014).
 
On appeal, Davis claims the District Court erred by
 
(1) admitting State's Exhibits 1 and 2 (Intoxilyzer 8000 Accuracy
 Tests of February 29, 2012 and March 16, 2012 respectively)
 because (a) they lacked foundation and, therefore, relevance, and
 (b) they violated Davis's right to confrontation, and (2) taking judicial notice that (a) the manufacturer of the Intoxilyzer 8000 was CMI, Inc., (b) the Intoxilyzer 8000 was approved by the State of Hawai
'i, Department of Health (DOH) as an accepted breath-
alcohol testing instrument, (c) the use of the Internal Standards of the Intoxilyzer 8000 as an accuracy verification device that

was approved by the DOH, and (d) the Honolulu Police Department
 
Intoxilyzer 8000 Breath Alcohol Operator Training Program Outline
 dated February 4, 2009 complied with Hawaii Administrative Rule
 (HAR) § 11-114-10.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Davis's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The District Court did not err by admitting 
State's Exhibits 1 and 2. The exhibits were admissible under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(8) and 902(4). The Intoxilyzer 8000 accuracy tests by the Honolulu Police Department are required to be kept and maintained by the intoxilyzer supervisor for at least three years. Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 11-114-12. Thus, the exhibits are public records or reports of a public agency and, therefore, an exception to hearsay within the meaning of HRE Rule 803(b)(8). As conceded by Davis the exhibits were also self authenticating under HRE Rule 902(4) as certified copies of public records. The exhibits were certified as a true, full, and correct copies of the originals by the custodian of records and had an embossed seal. Thus, Davis's objection for lack of foundation was without merit. Davis did not specifically object to admission of the exhibits based on relevance. Therefore, the point of error is waived. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). Even if he 
did object for lack of relevance, Davis points out that "absent evidence that the Intoxilyzer had been verified for accuracy within thirty-one days of Davis'[s] breath test, as required by HAR § 11-114-7(a)(6), . . . The trial court thus further erred in admitting the breath result." The exhibits state that the "The Intoxilyzer was operating accurately in compliance with the State of Hawaii Department of Health Administrative Rules, Title Eleven, Chapter 114-7" on February 29, 2012 and March 16, 2012. Thus, the exhibits were relevant to demonstrate that the Intoxilyzer 8000 was working accurately during Davis's breath test on March 3, 2012. Further, admission of the exhibits did not violate Davis's right to confrontation. See State v. West,

(SDO).
 
(2) The District Court did not err by taking judicial
 
notice that CMI, Inc. was the manufacturer of the Intoxilyzer
 8000, the Intoxilyzer 8000 was approved by the DOH as an accepted
 breath-alcohol testing instrument, the use of the Internal
 Standards of the Intoxilyzer 8000 as an accuracy verification
 device that was approved by the DOH, and the Honolulu Police
 Department Intoxilyzer 8000 Breath Alcohol Operator Training
 Program Outline dated February 4, 2009 complied with HAR § 11­114-10. Id. at *2-4.
