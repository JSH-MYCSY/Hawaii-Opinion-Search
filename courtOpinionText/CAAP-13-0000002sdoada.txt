STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
REED W. SAILOLA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-03671)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
On December 6, 2012, after a consolidated stipulated
 
fact hearing on his motion to suppress evidence and trial, the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District
 
1
Court)  convicted and sentenced Defendant-Appellant Reed W.
Sailola (Sailola) of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of
 an Intoxicant in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 ยง 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2014).
 
In bringing this appeal, Sailola alleges the District

 
Court erred in denying his Motion to Suppress for three reasons. 
First, Sailola contends that he was inadequately advised of his
 rights before deciding whether to take a breath or blood alcohol
 test; second that this decision was made without benefit of
 warnings mandated by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966); and
 third, that his statutory right to counsel under HRS ยง 803-9
 (2014) was violated.

These arguments are identical to those presented to and 
rejected by this court in State v. Won, 134 Hawai 'i 59, 332 P.3d 
661 (App. 2014), cert. granted, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Sailola's motion to suppress and we affirm his conviction and sentence under HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(3).
