01576, 3DTC-09-000112, and 3DTC-09-029447, and on December 6, 2012, in 3DTC-12-001003. Kana

In the District Court, Kana 'ele moved to dismiss the 
charges. He asserted that he was a subject of the Kingdom of 
Hawai'i, that he was cited in the Kingdom of Hawai 'i, and that the 
District Court lacked jurisdiction over his cases. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, and Kana
'ele entered 
conditional pleas of no contest on all the charges. Based on his 
pleas, the District Court found Kana 'ele guilty and sentenced him 
to various fines and assessments. 
I.
 
On appeal, Kana 'ele argues that the District Court 
lacked jurisdiction over his cases because the Hawaiian Kingdom 
continues to exist and he is a subject of the Hawaiian Kingdom. We conclude that Kana
'ele's argument is foreclosed by decisions 
of the Hawai 'i Supreme Court and this court. State v. Kaulia, 
128 Hawai 'i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013); State v. Fergerstrom, 106 
Hawai'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai 'i 
41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). 
In Kaulia, the defendant, Dennis Kaulia, contended that 
"the courts of the State of Hawai 'i lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction over his criminal prosecution because the defense proved the existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the illegitimacy of the State of Hawai
'i government." Kaulia, 128 Hawai 'i at 486­
87, 291 P.3d at 384-85. The supreme court rejected Kaulia's claim. Id. The supreme court ruled as follows: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the
Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm that"[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness" of itsorigins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now, a lawful
government." State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101
P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d
225 (2004). Individuals claiming to be citizens of theKingdom and not of the State are not exempt from applicationof the State's laws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State 
v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai' i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State 
v. French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.
1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999).

Thus we also reject Kaulia's argument that the circuit
court erred in precluding Kaulia from calling a witness to
present evidence concerning the existence of the Kingdom in
support of his Motion to Dismiss.
 
Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385.
 
In Fergerstrom, this court stated:
 
[T]he State of Hawai' i has lawful jurisdiction over all
persons operating motor vehicles on public roads or highwayswithin the State of Hawai' i. Persons claiming to be
citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai' i and not of the State of 
Hawai'i are not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai' i 
applicable to all persons (citizens and non-citizens)operating motor vehicles on public roads and highways withinthe State of Hawai' i. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i at 55, 101 P.3d at 664. 
Consistent with Kaulia and Fergerstrom, we hold that
 
the District Court had jurisdiction over Kana 'ele's cases. 
II.
 
We affirm the Judgments entered by the District Court
 
on December 5, 2012, in 3DTA-10-03972, 3DTA-12-01576, 3DTC-09­
000112, and 3DTC-09-029447, and on December 6, 2012, in 3DTC-12­001003.
