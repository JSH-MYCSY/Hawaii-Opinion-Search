APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0781(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bruce Chadwick (Chadwick) appeals
 
from the Order Denying Defendant Bruce Chadwick's Motion to Set
 
Aside Judgments entered on December 14, 2012, by the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1
 
On appeal, Chadwick raises a single point of error,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in denying his motion to
 set aside judgments because a mortgage loan, which was the
 subject of the prior foreclosure action, was purportedly made by
 an unlicensed lender rendering the loan void and unenforceable.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve Chadwick's point of error as
 follows:

 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presiding.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On October 9, 2009, Plaintiff-Appellee E*Trade Bank
 
(E*Trade) filed a complaint of foreclosure against Chadwick and
 
others. On February 22, 2011, the Circuit Court entered a
 
judgment in favor of E*Trade on a decree of foreclosure. 
Chadwick appealed. On January 19, 2012, in CAAP-11-0000112, this
 court entered a Summary Disposition Order affirming the decree of
 foreclosure. Judgment was entered. No further review was
 sought. The subject property was auctioned by the foreclosure
 commissioner and sold to E*Trade.
 
On October 31, 2012, Chadwick filed a motion to set 
aside the prior orders and judgments, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(4) and/or (6), on the 
grounds that a mortgage loan, which was the subject of the prior 
foreclosure action, was purportedly made by an unlicensed lender rendering the loan void and unenforceable. On December 14, 2012, the Circuit Court entered its order denying Chadwick's motion. Chadwick timely filed a notice of appeal. 
We conclude that the issue being raised on this appeal 
was a potential defense which should have been raised in the underlying foreclosure action, which is now final. This court has previously held that "a judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law." Citicorp Mortg. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 
422, 430, 16 P.3d 827, 835 (App. 2000) (citations omitted). As this court previously concluded in CAAP-11-0000112, "Chadwick's contention that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction over the matter is without merit." HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) is not applicable. In addition, Chadwick's attempt to seek relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), after his prior unsuccessful appeal, appears to be "an untimely attempt at a second bite at the apple," which is not a permissible use of Rule 60(b)(6) and is barred by the principles of res judicata. See Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i at 433-34, 
16 P.3d 838-39; see also Mortg. Elec. Reg. Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai
'i 11, 304 P.3d 1192 (2013).
