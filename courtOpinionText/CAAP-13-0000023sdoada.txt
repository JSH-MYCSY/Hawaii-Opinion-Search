 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Elberson appeals from the Judgment entered by the
 
District Court on December 17, 2012. On appeal, Elberson
 
contends that: (1) the District Court erred in permitting the
 State to amend its complaint; (2) the amended complaint was
 defective because it was pled in the disjunctive and failed to
 include the statutory definition of the term "alcohol"; (3) the
 results of his breath test should have been suppressed; (4) the
 State failed to lay a sufficient foundation for the admission of
 the test results, which showed that Elberson had a breath alcohol
 concentration of .167 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath 
-- a concentration that exceeded the legal limit; (5) the
 District Court improperly took judicial notice that the use of
 the Intoxilyzer 8000 for breath alcohol testing was approved by
 the DUI Coordinator; (6) there was insufficient evidence to prove
 that he operated or was in actual physical control of a vehicle;
 and (7) there was insufficient evidence to prove that the alleged
 impairment had not been caused by denatured alcohol. We affirm.
 
I.
 
We resolve the issues raised by Elberson on appeal as
 
follows:
 
1. The District Court did not err in permitting the 
State to amend its complaint to allege the requisite mens rea for the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) violation. See State v. Kam, 134 Hawai
'i 
280, 285-87, 339 P.3d 1081, 1086-88 (2014), cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000897 (Apr. 2, 2015). In any event, the State chose to proceed to trial only on the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) violation, which had been properly charged in the original complaint. 
2. The State's OVUII charge was permissibly pled in 
the disjunctive. See State v. Codiamat, 131 Hawai
'i 220, 226-27, 
317 P.3d 664, 670-71 (2013); State v. Vaimili, 134 Hawai 'i 264, 
272-73, 339 P.3d 1065, 1073-74 (App. 2014), cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000115, 2015 WL 745351 (Feb. 20, 2015). The charge was not defective for failing to allege the statutory definition of the term alcohol. State v. Turping, No. CAAP-13-0002957, 2015 WL

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
792715 (Hawai 'i App. Feb. 25, 2015), cert. denied, No. SCWC-13­
0002957 (May 20, 2015). 
3. Elberson's claim that the results of his breath 
test should have been suppressed because they were unlawfully 
obtained is without merit. State v. Won, 134 Hawai 'i 59, 332 
P.3d 661 (App. 2014), cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014). 
4. The State laid a sufficient foundation for the 
admission of the breath test results. The State sufficiently established the reliability of the test results by demonstrating compliance with the applicable administrative rules. The State was not required to show compliance with manufacturer recommendations to lay a sufficient foundation for the admission of the test results. See State v. Hsu, No. CAAP-10-0000214, 2013 
WL 1919514, at *1-2 (Hawai
'i App. May 9, 2013) (SDO), cert. 
denied, No. SCWC-10-0000214, 2013 WL 4459000 (Aug. 20, 2013).3 
We also reject Elberson's claim that the breath test results were admitted in violation of his due process rights and his right to discovery. See id, 2013 WL 1919514, at *2-3; State v. 
Richardson, No. CAAP-12-0000775, 2015 WL 1959206, at *3 (Hawai
'i 
App. Apr. 30, 2015). 
5. The District Court did not err in taking judicial
 
notice of the DUI Coordinator's approval of: (1) the Intoxylizer
 8000 as a breath alcohol testing instrument; and (2) the use of
 its Internal Standards as an accuracy verification device.

Elberson claims that the references in Hawai' i Administrative Rules 
(HAR) § 11-114-5(b), with respect to model specifications of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and to conforming productslists, do not exist. This claim is without merit. The references in HAR § 11-114-5(b) are to notices contained in the Federal Register from the UnitedStates Department of Transportation (DOT) NHTSA. For example, Volume 49 ofthe Federal Register at pages 48854-48865 contains notices from the DOT NHTSAdated December 14, 1984, regarding "Highway Safety Programs; Standard forDevices to Measure Breath Alcohol" and "Highway Safety Programs; ModelSpecifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices: Publication of aConforming Products List." Volume 49 of the Federal Register at pages 48865­48872 contains a notice from the DOH NHTSA dated December 14, 1984, regarding"Highway Safety Programs; Model Specifications for Calibrating Units for
Breath Alcohol Testers; Publication of Conforming Products List."

Although the State failed to submit copies of the judicially 
noticed documents as the District Court instructed, the State has provided those documents on appeal. See Hawaii Rules of Evidence 
(HRE) Rule 201(f) (1993) ("Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceeding."); State v. Davis, 133 Hawai
'i 102, 122, 
324 P.3d 912, 932 (2014) (taking judicial notice on appeal). The DUI Coordinator's approvals were the proper subject of judicial notice. See Rule 201(b) (1993); State v. West, No. CAAP-12­
0000717 at 4-7 (Hawai
'i App. May 27, 2015) (SDO). 
6. There was sufficient evidence to prove that
 
Elberson operated or was in actual physical control of a vehicle. 
Based on Elberson's stipulation that there was "reasonable
 suspicion [for the stop] and probable cause for [the arrest], and
 that gets us up to where they can compel him to read the implied
 consent form[,]" the District Court could reasonably infer that
 Elberson had been operating a vehicle. 
7. The statutory exception for denatured alcohol is a
 
defense, which the State was not required to allege in the OVUII
 charge and on which Elberson bore the initial burden of producing
 evidence. Turping, 2015 WL 792715, at *3-5; State v. Nobriga, 10
 
Haw. App. 353, 359-60, 873 P.2d 110, 113-14 (1994). Elberson did
 not offer any evidence to support a "denatured alcohol" defense
 and thus the State was not required to disprove the defense. 
II. 
We affirm the District Court's Judgment.
