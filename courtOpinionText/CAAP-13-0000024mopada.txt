Order (1) Denying [the Billetes'] Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction, and (2) Granting [Deutsche Bank's]
 Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession filed November
 28, 2012, which was filed on January 8, 2013 (Order Denying
Reconsideration).
 
BACKGROUND FACTS
 
This case involves a property in Ewa Beach, Hawai
'i 
96706 (the Property), that the Billetes acquired in 2000. In 
2006, as consideration for a loan, the Billetes granted HCL 
Finance, Inc. (HCL) a mortgage on the property and signed a 
promissory note for $530,000. The mortgage stated that "'MERS' 
is Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. MERS is a separate corporation that is acting solely as a nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns. MERS is the mortgagee under this Security Instrument." It appears that HCL dissolved in 2009. 
On September 16, 2009, an Assignment of Mortgage was 
recorded in the State of Hawai
'i Land Court System in which MERS 
"solely as nominee for HCL Finance, Inc." assigned the rights in the mortgage to Deutsche Bank as Trustee for GSR Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-OA1 (the Trust). Also on September 16, 2009, Deutsche 
Bank filed a Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under 
Power of Sale in the Bureau of Conveyances. The notice was sent by certified mail to the Billetes, was posted on the subject property, and was published once a week for three successive weeks in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. A non-judicial foreclosure sale was postponed until April 29, 2010 with postponement announced by crying out the postponement date at the time and place of the scheduled auction. Notices of Continuance of Sale were also sent by certified mail to the Billetes. At the auction, the property was sold to Deutsche Bank as Trustee for the Trust for $499,500. On July 14, 2010, counsel for Deutsche Bank sent a letter to the Billetes, demanding that they vacate the Property, which they refused to do. Deutsche Bank recorded a Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale in the Land Court on July 5, 2012. On the same day, a Transfer Certificate 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Title (TCT) No. 1044607 was issued transferring ownership to
 
Deutsche Bank. On August 24, 2012 Deutsche Bank filed a Verified
 
Complaint for Summary Possession and Ejectment in the District
 Court. 
The Billetes filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction on September 18, 2012, attaching a
 joint declaration pursuant to District Court Rules of Civil
 
2
Procedures (DCRCP) Rule 12.1.  They argued that "[Deutsche
 
Bank] cannot prove superior title to the property as a matter of
 law, and genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute with
 respect to who holds superior title in this ejectment action." 
They alleged, 
inter alia, that because HCL dissolved before the
 
mortgage was transferred to Deutsche Bank as Trustee, "it was
 legally impossible for HCL, or MERS as nominee, or anyone to have
 assigned [the] mortgage in September 2009." They also contended
 that by the terms of the Trust, Deutsche Bank, as Trustee, "had
 absolutely no authority to accept any new assets, including our
 mortgage loan, after the Closing Date of said Trust." Thus, they
 requested that the action be dismissed pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d) (Supp. 2014).

 DCRCP Rule 12.1 states: 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in defense
of an action in the nature of an action of trespass or for
the summary possession of land, or any other action, the
defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.

 HRS § 604-5(d) states: 
(d) The district courts shall not have cognizance of
real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate
comes in question, nor actions for libel, slander,
defamation of character, malicious prosecution, false
imprisonment, breach of promise of marriage, or seduction;
nor shall they have power to appoint referees in any cause.

Deutsche Bank filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and
 
Writ of Possession on September 20, 2012. A hearing on this
 
motion as well as the Billetes' motion to dismiss was held on
 November 1, 2012. On November 15, 2012, the District Court
 entered its Order Denying Motion to Dismiss. Also on November
 15, 2012, the court entered a Judgment of Possession and a Writ
 of Possession in favor of Deutsche Bank. 
The Billetes filed a motion to reconsider the November
 
15, 2012 Order on November 28, 2012, based on DCRCP Rule 59(e).
4
 
The Order Denying Reconsideration was filed on January 8, 2013. 
The Billetes filed a notice of appeal on January 11, 2013. 
I. POINTS OF ERROR
 
The Billetes raise the following points of error on
 
appeal:
 
(1) The District Court erred in denying the Billetes'
 
motion to dismiss and in granting summary judgment and a writ of
 possession when the Billetes established in their DCRCP Rule 12.1
 declaration that title to the Property was in dispute; 
(2) The District Court erred in holding (1) that
 
Deutsche Bank's title was conclusive and unimpeachable when the
 Billetes were then listed as owners in TCT, and (2) that entry of
 a TCT is purely a ministerial act that does not affect title to
 the real property; and
 
(3) The District Court erred in granting Deutsche
 
Bank's motion for summary judgment as material facts were still
 in dispute. 
II. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"The trial court's ruling on a motion for
reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion 
standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. 
Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621
(2002) (citation omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs if 
the trial court has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonor disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10,
26 (1992) (citation omitted). 
4
 DCRCP Rule 59(e) reads: "Motion to alter or amend a Judgment.  A
 
motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served no later than 10 days
after entry of judgment."

Cho v. State of Hawai 'i, 115 Hawai 'i 373, 381, 168 P.3d 17, 25 
(2007).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Appellate Jurisdiction
 The Billetes did not timely appeal from the Order
 
Denying Motion to Dismiss, Judgment for Possession, or Writ of
 Possession within thirty days as required by Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) ("When a civil appeal is
 
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30
 
days after entry of the judgment or appealable order.").5 It
 
appears, however, that the Billetes attempted to toll the
 deadline to file their appeal by filing their November 28, 2012
 DCRCP Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) states
 
that:
 
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion[.]
 
Nevertheless, DCRCP Rule 59(e) states that a motion to
 
alter or amend a judgment shall be served not later than ten days
 
after entry of the judgment. Thus, the Billetes' November 28,
 2012 DCRCP Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider was not timely and did
 not toll the time limit for filing a notice of appeal from the
 Judgment of Possession pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).

5 Although it appears that Deutsche Bank had an outstanding claim
for monetary damages, "[t]he Forgay doctrine is an exception to the finality
requirement for appeals and it allows an appellant to immediately appeal ajudgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties havenot been finally resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d
702, 704 (1995). Here, the November 15, 2012 Judgment for Possession wasaccompanied by the Writ of Possession commanding the Director of PublicSafety, his/her deputy, or any police officer or authorized person to removethe Billetes from the property and put the property into the full possessionof Deutsche Bank. Thus, the Judgment for Possession was immediately
appealable under the Forgay doctrine. Id.

 As discussed further, the Billetes' motion for reconsideration is
better classified as a DCRCP Rule 60(b) motion, rather than a DCRCP Rule 59(e)
motion. However, this does not change the fact that their appeal from theJudgment of Possession was untimely. We have previously held that a motionbrought under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b), which is the
circuit courts' counterpart to DCRCP Rule 60(b), does not toll the deadline to
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appellant's failure to file a timely notice of appeal is a
 
jurisdictional defect that can neither be waived by the parties
 nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of judicial
 discretion." Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1130 (1986) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets
 omitted).
 
While we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review
 
the November 15, 2012 dispositions, we have jurisdiction over the
 District Court's January 8, 2013 Order Denying Reconsideration. 
Although the Billetes' DCRCP Rule 59(e) motion was untimely, we
 interpret the motion as brought pursuant to DCRCP Rule 60(b)
7
 
which does not contain a ten day deadline. See Madden v. Madden,
 
43 Haw. 148, 149-50 (Haw. Terr. 1959) ("the substance of the
 pleading controls, not the nomenclature given to the pleading"). "An order denying a motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP
 60(b) [the circuit courts' counterpart to DCRCP 60(b)] is an
 appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) [(Supp. 2014)]." 

Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 974, 981 (2003). 
6(...continued)
file a notice of appeal unless it is brought within ten days after the
judgment is entered. Lambert v. Lua, 92 Hawai' i 228, 234, 990 P.2d 126, 132
(App. 1999). Thus, whether the motion to reconsider was brought under DCRCP
Rule 59(e) or DCRCP Rule 60(b), because it was not filed within ten days after
November 15, 2012, it did not extend the time to appeal the Order Denying
Motion to Dismiss, Judgment of Possession, or Writ of Possession entered on
that date.
 
7 DCRCP Rule 60(b) reads, in relevant part: 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or the party's legal representative from a
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due
diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for
a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore
denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or
other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is
void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made
within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3)
not more than one year after the judgment, order, or
proceeding was entered or taken.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Accordingly, the Billetes timely appealed the January 8, 2013
 
Order Denying Reconsideration.
 
B. The Billetes' Motion to Reconsider
 Pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d), the district courts do not
 
have jurisdiction over actions in which title to real estate
 comes into question. When a defendant seeks to raise the defense
 that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the
 action, 
such defense shall be asserted by a written answer or
written motion, which shall not be received by the court
unless accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting
forth the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.
 
DCRCP Rule 12.1. The Billetes raised their objection to the
 
District Court's jurisdiction in their September 18, 2012 motion
 to dismiss, which was accompanied by their joint declaration.
 
After the court denied the Billetes' motion to dismiss,
 
the Billetes contended in their motion for reconsideration that
 the denial was in error. The Billetes argued, inter alia, that
 the assignment of the mortgage to Deutsche Bank was "completely
 void" because the assignment took place after HCL had dissolved
 and thus it was "legally impossible" for MERS to assign the
 mortgage as HCL's nominee. They also argued that because the GSR
 Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-OA1 closed by its own terms on August
 24, 2006, Deutsche Bank "had absolutely no authority to accept
 any new assets, including the subject mortgage loan, after the
 Closing Date of said Trust." Thus, Deutsche Bank's chain of
 title was purportedly broken, the Billetes had superior title,
 and the dispute over title to the property mandated dismissal of
 the action in the District Court. 
In response, Deutsche Bank submitted a certified copy
 
of TCT No. 1044607, which states on its face that it was issued
 on July 5, 2012. HRS § 501-88 (2006): Certificate as evidence,
 provides that:
 
The original certificate in the registration book, and any
copy thereof duly certified under the signature of the
registrar or assistant registrar, and the seal of the court,
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
shall be received as evidence in all the courts of the State
 
and shall be conclusive as to all matters contained therein,
except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
 
Further, HRS § 501-118 (2006) reads, in part, "[a]fter a new 
certificate of title has been entered, no judgment recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due thereon shall operate to open the foreclosure or affect the title to registered land." (Emphasis added). Based on these statutes, the Hawai
'i supreme 
court in Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores held that after the issuance of a certificate of title, title to the subject property becomes conclusive and unimpeachable. 107 Hawai
'i 95, 102-03, 
110 P.3d 1042, 1049-50 (2005). Thus, despite the Billetes' contentions that a dispute over the title existed, Deutsche Bank's TCT was conclusive evidence of title. 
In their motion for reconsideration and on appeal, the
 
Billetes argue that Aames is distinguishable because in the
 present case, "[t]he record below does not establish that a new
 TCT was entered prior to Appellants contesting title in their
 Motion to Dismiss[.]" The record on appeal includes a
 declaration by the Billetes' counsel, Ericka Shea Hunter
 (Hunter), stating that on September 14, 2012, she had gone to the
 
Bureau of Conveyances and requested copies of both the Billetes'
 
TCT (Certificate No. 559741) and Deutsche Bank's TCT (Certificate
 No. 1044607). According to Hunter, the clerk at the Bureau told
 her that Deutsche Bank's TCT "had not yet been entered into the
 system" and wrote "Has not been entered" on the request form. 
Nevertheless, it appears that the "issuance" of the 
transfer certificate of title, and not the date the certificate becomes searchable in the Bureau of Conveyances, is the date on which title becomes conclusive under Aames. In Aames, the court noted that the defendants' assertions that title was disputed and the district court lacked jurisdiction "came after, and not prior to, the Land Court's issuance of TCT No. 587,098. Accordingly, title to the subject property in [plaintiff] became 'conclusive and unimpeachable.'" Aames, 107 Hawai
'i at 102-03, 110 P.3d at 
1049-50 (emphasis added). Here, Deustche Bank's TCT stated that it was issued on July 5, 2012. Thus, as in Aames, Deutsche 
8
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bank's title was conclusive and unimpeachable as of the date its
 
TCT was issued, which was before the Billetes asserted that title
 was in dispute.
 
We therefore conclude that the District Court did not
 
abuse its discretion in denying the Billetes' motion to
 reconsider. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
For these reasons, we dismiss the Billetes' appeal as
 
to the November 15, 2012 Order Denying Dismissal, Judgment of
 Possession, and Writ of Possession, and affirm the District
 Court's January 8, 2013 Order Denying Reconsideration.
