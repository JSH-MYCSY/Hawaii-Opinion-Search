DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY A NATIONAL BANKING

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(EWA DIVISION)
(DC CIVIL NO. 1RC12-1-6213)
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART
 
APPELLANTS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
On December 7, 2015, Defendants-Appellants Joseph
 
Billete and Marival Billete (the Billetes) filed a Motion for
 
Reconsideration of this Court's November 27, 2015 Memorandum
 
Opinion, arguing that: (1) the court erred in concluding that
 the Billetes did not timely appeal from the Order Denying Motion
 to Dismiss, Judgment for Possession, or Writ of Possession, which
 were entered on November 15, 2012, because to the extent their
 November 28, 2012 motion sought relief pursuant to District Court
 Rules of Civil Procedures (DCRCP) Rule 59(e), it was untimely;

and (2) the court erred in concluding that the date of the
 "issuance" of the subject transfer certificate of title, and not
 the date that the certificate became searchable in the Bureau of

 This court nevertheless considered, pursuant to DCRCP 60(b), the
arguments raised by the Billetes in their November 28, 2012 motion.

Conveyances, was the date upon which title became conclusive and 
unimpeachable under Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai 'i 95, 
102-03, 110 P.3d 1042, 1049-50 (2005). 
The motion is granted in part as to the first issue. 
Although the Billetes' district court motion for reconsideration was filed on November 28, 2012, it appears from the record on appeal that the motion was served on Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, a National Bank Association, as Trustee for GSR 2006-OA1 (Deutsche Bank) on November 26, 2012. 
DCRCP Rule 59(e), unlike Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
59(e), requires service, not filing, not later than 10 days after 
entry of judgment.2 
Nevertheless, the Billetes' DCRCP Rule 12.1
 
Declaration's challenge to MERS's authority to assign the
 Billetes' mortgage to Deutsche Bank, which they assert rendered
 that assignment fraudulent, is without merit. In addition, as
 the Billetes failed to raise their challenge to the notice of the
 change of the date, time, and place of the foreclosure sale prior
 to the issuance of the transfer certificate of title, in
 accordance with Aames, the Billetes failed in their DCRCP Rule
 12.1 Declaration to state particulars concerning a basis for
 their claim that title was in issue. 
The Billetes' December 7, 2015 Motion for
 
Reconsideration is otherwise denied.
 
For these reasons, the District Court of the First
 
Circuit's November 15, 2012 Order Denying Dismissal, Judgment of
 Possession, and Writ of Possession, as well as the District

 The Billetes also submit that the motion to reconsider was 
submitted to and received by the district court on November 26, 2012, but that
the district court delayed the entry into the record for two days. The document they rely upon does not appear to be in the record on appeal. In light of the service date, however, we need not seek clarification of thefiling date, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 10(e).
