Court)2 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
[Defendant/Cross-Claimant-Appellee J.L.P. Robinson LLC's
 
(Robinson)] Motion for Confirmation Of Sale, for Writ of
 Possession, For Disposal of Personal Property and for Deficiency
 Judgment Filed on October 10, 2012" (Order Confirming Sale) as
 well as the Judgment entered on the Order Confirming Sale and
 Judgment for Possession, all entered on December 19, 2012.
 
On appeal, the Allens maintain that the Circuit Court
 
erred in issuing the Order Confirming Sale, because the credit
 bid in the amount of $110,00.00 for the condominium at issue was
 insufficient, and therefore the Order Confirming Sale and the
 corresponding judgments in Robinson's favor should be vacated and
 remanded.
 
After reviewing the record on appeal, the points
 
properly raised by the Allens, the parties' arguments and the
 applicable legal authority, we resolve the Allens' appeal as
 follows and affirm.
 
On appeal, the Allens present one point of error. They
 
allege that the "credit bid of $110,000 was so grossly
 insufficient as to shock the conscience of any reasonable person,
 especially in these circumstances where the subject property had
 been rendered unmarketable by Robinson preventing competitive
 bidding" and therefore "the Circuit Court's order confirming sale
 and judgment thereon should be reversed, and the case remanded
 for further proceedings."
 
The Allens support this single point of error on appeal
 
with two arguments, as follows: (1) "The sale of the property
 for a credit bid of $110,000 to Robinson should shock the
 conscience of any reasonable person[;]" and (2) "The
 Commissioner's inability to market and sell the property for a
 fair and reasonable price is the result of Robinson's own unfair
 self-dealing."
 
We reject the first argument, as it is based on the
 
fallacious premise that a reasonable valuation of the subject
 property, against which the accepted bid should be compared,

includes the fee simple interest, which the Allens did not own. 
The Allens provide no authority for this proposition.
 
The Allens also do not provide authority for their
 
second assertion, that the Board of Directors of the Association
 of Unit Owners of Yacht Harbor Towers and Robinson's alleged
 "self-dealing" in renegotiating the lease rental fee increase is
 a valid basis for overturning the instant foreclosure sale
 conducted more than five years later.
 
On this record, the Allens have failed to show the 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in confirming the foreclosure sale. Sugarman v. Kapu, 104 Hawai
'i 119, 124, 85 P.3d 644, 649 
(2004). 
Therefore, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's
 
(1) "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 [Defendant/Cross-Claimant-Appellee J.L.P. Robinson LLC's] Motion
 for Confirmation Of Sale, for Writ of Possession, for Disposal of
 Personal Property and for Deficiency Judgment Filed on
 October 10, 2012[,]" (2) Judgment; and (3) Judgment for
 Possession, all entered on December 19, 2012 are affirmed.
