APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-0193)
 
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE'S MOTION TO DISMISS
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
On April 22, 2013, Plaintiff-Appellee Federal Land Bank
 
Association of Hawaii, FLCA (FLBA) filed a motion to dismiss the
 
appeal filed by Defendants-Appellants Morton E. Bassan, Jr., and
 Kekio Bassan (collectively, "Appellants"). Appellants filed a
 notice of appeal from the "Order Denying Defendants Bassan's Non-
Hearing Motion for Stay of Execution of Writ of Possession and
 Judgment for Possession & Attached Orders Pending Appeal" (Order
 Denying Motion for Stay of Execution) that was entered by the 
1
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court)  on December
24, 2012.
 
In support of its motion to dismiss, FLBA asserts that:
 
(1) Appellants have filed a separate appeal, Appeal No. CAAP-12Â­
0000866, from the Circuit Court's "Order Denying Motion for
 Reconsideration of Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order
 Granting FLBA's Motion for Summary Judgment and For Decree of
 Foreclosure," which is still pending in this court; (2) after the
 Circuit Court issued its Order Denying Motion for Stay of
 Execution, Appellants filed a motion for stay pending appeal in
 Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000866, seeking the same relief that the
 Circuit Court had denied its Order Denying Motion for Stay of
 Execution; and (3) this court denied the motion for stay pending
 appeal filed by Appellants in Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000886. 
FLBA argues that Appellants' appeal from the Order
 
Denying Motion for Stay of Execution should be dismissed as moot
 because the Writ of Possession has already been executed and
 Appellants are no longer occupying the subject premises. 
In
 
support of its claim that this appeal is moot, FLBA submitted a
 "Return of Service -- Writ of Possession" filed in the Circuit
 Court on February 21, 2013, in which the authorized process
 server certified that the Writ of Possession had been duly
 executed and completed and that Appellants and other occupants
 have removed themselves from the subject premises. Appellants do
 not provide any basis: (1) to dispute FLBA's assertion that the
 Writ of Possession has been executed and that they are no longer
 occupying the subject premises or (2) for this court to conclude
 that an exception to the mootness doctrine applies. 
FLBA additionally argues that the appeal should be
 
dismissed because this court already denied Appellants' motion
 for a stay pending appeal in Appeal No. CAAP-12-0000886. 
Upon consideration of FLBA's motion to dismiss the
 
appeal and the records and files in this case, we conclude that
 
1 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
 
2
 Appellants' appeal from the Order Denying Motion for Stay of 
Execution is moot. See Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, 
312, 141 P.3d 480, 485 (2006) (stating that the court has a duty to avoid giving "opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it"); Johnson v. Martofel, 797 A.2d 943, 946-47 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2002) (concluding that the sheriff's execution of the writ of possession rendered the request for stay of the execution moot). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that FLBA's motion to dismiss the
 
appeal is granted, and this appeal is dismissed.
