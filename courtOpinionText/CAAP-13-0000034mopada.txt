Court of the Third Circuit  (family court).
 
Chen raises seven points of error2

 in case no. CAAP-13­
1 The Honorable Anthony K. Bartholomew presided. 
2 Although Chen lists seven points of error, many of the points of error
are irrelevant to the issues on remand. "[A] determination of a question oflaw made by an appellate court in the course of an action becomes the law ofthe case . . . ." Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 Hawai' i 40, 47, 890 P.2d 277, 284
(1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, "the lower tribunal onlyhas the authority to carry out the appellate court's mandate." Standard 
Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 99 Hawai' i 125, 137, 53 P.3d 264, 276 (App. 2001)
(quoting Warren v. Dep't of Admin., 590 So. 2d 514, 515 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.1991)). To the extent that Chen's points of error fall beyond the scope ofremand, we decline to address them.
 Chen lists the following seven points of error in her opening brief:
 
1.	 No evidence was found by the Court to establish the
2001 Marital Asset Value to clarify what asset values
the parties had agreed upon in the Post-Nuptial
Agreement, leaving the Court to purely speculate; this
indicates that the agreement was unconscionable when
it was executed.
 
2.	 The "agreement" did not meet the standard of care and
standard of practice in Hawaii provided by the Hawaii
Divorce Manual that financial disclosure should be in
 writing in order for a one-sided Post-Nuptial
Agreement to be deemed enforceable.
 
3.	 The Court failed to analyze the marital residence as
the Category 5 asset under the Marital Partnership
Principle since no evidence suggested category 1 asset
was used to purchase the marital residence; the Court
purely speculated marital residence was category 1
after validating the agreement.
 
4.	 No evidence was found to establish the value of the
 parties' assets as of June, 2001, which indicates that
the issue of unconscionability of the provision
governing division of property in a premarital
agreement was not evaluated, which should have been
evaluated at the time the agreement was executed, and
this demonstrated that the "agreement" was clearly
unconscionable when it was signed in 2001. 
5.	 No evidence was found to suggest either party could
attain access to the other party's financial status at
the time of the "agreement" was signed; the Court
simply speculated that Chen had "direct knowledge of
Hoeflinger's financial situation[.]"
 
6.	 The Court failed to explain how Chen's
involvement in "all aspects of the activities"
would provide her with direct knowledge of
Hoeflinger's financial situation and failed to
explain how this knowledge "equipped [her] to
make [her] own informed assessment of the value
of the marital residence" prior to assent[ing]
to the agreement. 
7. The Court speculated the amount of Hoeflinger's 2001

 which we construe as three points of error: (1) the
 
 
family court erred in finding that the Post-Nuptial Agreement,
 
 
dated June 6, 2001, was enforceable because the evidence suggests
 
 
that the agreement was unconscionable; (2) the family court
 
 
failed to analyze the marital residence as a Category 5 asset
 
 
under the Marital Partnership Principle; and (3) Defendant-
 
Appellee Thomas J. Hoeflinger (Hoeflinger) wasted marital
 
 
4		 5

assets.   Chen also raises eleven points of error  in case no. 
 
2(...continued)
 
asset value when the agreement was signed. 
The
 
Court's assessment supports an unconscionability and
unjustly disproportionate of the parties' assets.
 
3
 Chen's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4), which states that the brief shall have 
[a] concise statement of the points of error set forth
in separately numbered paragraphs. Each point shall
state: (i) the alleged error committed by the court or
agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error
occurred; (iii) where in the record the alleged error
was objected to or the manner in which the alleged
error was brought to the attention of the court or
agency.
 
However, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that where possible,
the court should "permit litigants to appeal and to have their cases heard on
the merits, where possible." O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383,
386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994). 
4 We previously decided the issue of wasted marital assets in Chen
v.Hoeflinger
, 127 Hawai' i 346, 279 P.3d 11 (App. 2012). "Remand for a 
specific act does not reopen the entire case; the lower tribunal only has the
authority to carry out the appellate court's mandate." Standard Mgmt., Inc.,
99 Hawai' i at 137, 53 P.3d at 276 (brackets omitted) (citing Warren, 590 So.
2d at 515). This court's decision in Chen represents the law of the case onthis issue. See Weinberg, 78 Hawai' i at 47, 890 P.2d at 284. Therefore, we
need not address this point of error. 
5 The points of error asserted in No. CAAP-13-0005803 are as follows:
 
1.	 The Family Court in its September 25, 2013
 
reimbursement decision failed to recognize that the 

amount of $22,973.52 reimbursement was a result of 

Hoeflinger's going against previous Court's Order and 

transferring property Deed by using the invalided 

[(sic)] Chen's pre-signed Deed to take Chen's name off 

of the property title. The amount of $22,973.52 

reimbursement was granted without any consideration 

that this amount was non-Hawaii-residential taxes and 
 
 
fees that Chen was absolutely NOT entitled to pay. 
 
 
2.	 The family court failed to recognize that there was a
previous Court Order on December 12, 2007, stating
that "[t]he Court requires that the title to the
marital residence and unimproved lot be held as
tenants in common between Plaintiff and Defendant

5(...continued)
 
during the pending appeal. 
The Court further requires
that neither party encumber or transfer any of their
interest in the property pending appeal."
 
3.	 The Court failed to recognize that Chen had testified
in Court that she objected Hoeflinger's requests of
reimbursement of his nonresidential taxes and fees
 during the evidentiary hearing on Aug 9, 2013.
 
4.	 The Court failed to realize that during the
evidentiary hearing, Hoeflinger had NO objection about
Chen's statement that Hoeflinger had previously used
invalid deed to remove Chen's name from the property
Title and that his non-residential taxes and fees
 resulted from his fraudulent action to take Chen's
 name off of the property title. Hoeflinger did not
deny that he had transferred twice.
 
5.	 The Court failed to recognize that Chen had also
testified that due to his fraudulent action of taking
Chen's name off of the property title, Hoeflinger
should be responsible for paying all of his non­
residential property taxes and other fees.
 
6.	 There was NO termination of the January 7, 2013 Offer
by Hoeflinger prior to Chen's acceptance of his Offer.
The Family Court speculated that there had been "no
meeting of the minds" based on a series of events.
This decision is not in accordance with the Contract
 Law.
 
7.	 The Court assumed the Offer was terminated by
Hoeflinger based on a list of Hoeflinger's court
conducts between the time the offer was issued and
 Chen's acceptance of his offer. The events have no
 relationship with his January 7 offer and have no
indication of the termination of the Offer. The Court
 should not assume or infer that Hoeflinger "did not
consider that there was a settlement with Plaintiff
 pending" based on these the list of events.
 
8.	 The court's statement about Hoeflinger's Offer and
 
Chen's Acceptance of the Offer were inaccurate. The
 
 
Court in its decision #16 stated Chen "did not agree
 
to the payment that Defendant specified. Rather, she
 
proposed that the purchase price be the basis for an
 
adjustment of the equivalence that she was owed by
 
Defendant, and also proposed a 45 day time limit..."
 
This was totally inaccurate and incorrect. Chen
 
 
accepted the exact amount of the payments specified in
 
Hoeflinger's original Offer. First, in Chen's
 
acceptance letter, Chen agreed to what Hoeflinger
 
specified he owed Chen in the amount of $128,916.52. 
 
Secondly, Chen agreed to the total amount of
 
"$103,000.00 plus any amount of liens" for the total
 
purchase price that Hoeflinger specified in his
 
original offer.
 
 
9.	 The Court's statement about 45 day time limit was
inaccurate. The 45 day time limit was not a limit for
the offer but a limit of time for Hoeflinger to get
extra money from Chen. In order to expedite the
process, Chen was willing to forgive the difference

CAAP-13-0005803, which we construe as two points of error (1) the
 
family court erred in denying Chen's motion to enforce the
 settlement agreement because the January 14, 2013 communication
 from Hoeflinger constituted an offer that Chen had accepted; and
 (2) the family court erred in granting Hoeflinger's motion to
 reimburse because Hoeflinger took Chen's name off of the marital
 residence against court orders and his non-resident status
 subsequently increased the taxes on the property.
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case returns to us after remand to the family 
court in Chen v. Hoeflinger, 127 Hawai
'i 346, 279 P.3d 11 (App. 
2012). In Chen, we remanded to the family court "for further findings on the issue of the unconscionability of the Post-Nuptial Agreement and for recalculation and redistribution of the assets." Id. at 352, 279 P.3d at 17. We affirmed the family 
court's decisions on all other issues. Id. 
On remand, the parties agreed to proceed based on the
 
existing trial record, without any additional testimony or
 evidence. The family court issued its FOF/COL on December 17,
 2012. Chen appealed from the FOF/COL on January 17, 2013.
 
On February 12, 2013, Hoeflinger, pro se, filed a
 
"Motion for [Chen] to Reimburse [Hoeflinger] for Taxes, Insurance
 and Road Maintenance Fees Paid on Marital Residence Located at
 15307 Kiawe Street Per 'Order Partially Granting Stay of
 Judgement [sic] filed October 2, 2007'" (Hoeflinger's Motion for
 
5(...continued)
 
between the amount Hoeflinger owed and the purchase
 
price of the property because there is a difference
 
between the amounts of $128,916.52 for Hoeflinger
 
stated he owes Chen and $103,000.00 for the total
 
purchasing price. The difference between the two
 
 
amounts would be forgiven by Chen if Hoeflinger
 
complies within the 45 days of the agreement. The 45
 
 
day time limit in no way would alter the original
 
offer proposed by Hoeflinger[.]
 
 
10.
	 The existing order remaining in effect is a true
statement, and it has no effect on the offer and the
acceptance of the offer.
 
11.	 Importantly Hoeflinger did not dispute or argue any of
these points that Court had brought up in its
decision; instead Hoeflinger issued a brand new offer
on May 9, 2013 for Chen to settle.

Reimbursement). The family court granted this motion on
 
September 25, 2013.
 
On May 6, 2013, Chen filed "[Chen's] Motion to Enforce
 
the Settlement Agreement Between the Parties." On May 29, 2013,
 
Chen filed "[Chen's] Motion Enforcing the Settlement Agreement
 Between the Parties, Requesting Judgement [sic] to Order
 [Hoeflinger] to Convey Title of the House to [Chen]." On August
 7, 2013, Chen filed "[Chen's] Additional Supporting Information
 (Part III) for Motion Enforcing the Settlement Agreement Between
 the Parties, Requesting Judgement [sic] to Order [Hoeflinger] to
 Convey Title of the House to [Chen]" (collectively, Chen's Motion
 
to Enforce the Settlement Agreement). The family court denied
 
Chen's Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement on September
 
25, 2013.
 
On October 18, 2013, Chen filed a motion titled
 
"[Chen's] Motion for Reconsideration to Reimburse [Hoeflinger]
 for the Non-Resident Taxes, Insurance, and Road Maintenance Fees
 Paid on Marital Residence; Motion for Reconsideration of
 Enforcing the Settalement [sic] Agreement Between the Parties;
 Motion for Granting Extension for the Appeal Period (Sep 25-Oct
 25, 2013) in the Event of the Above Motions Being Denied"
 
6
(Motions for Reconsideration).  The family court denied each of
 
the motions on November 12, 2013. 
Chen appealed from the family
 
court's denial of her Motions for Reconsideration on December 2,
 2013.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW

 
A. Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
6 Chen appears to have filed her Motions for Reconsideration in response
to the family court's order granting Hoeflinger's Motion for Reimbursement and
its order denying Chen's Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement.

(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting Lepere v. United Pub. Workers, Local 646, 77 Hawai
'i 471, 474 n.5, 887 P.2d 1029, 1032 n.5 (1995).
B. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
The family court's FOFs are reviewed on appeal under
the "clearly erroneous" standard. A FOF is clearly
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in
support of the finding, the appellat court is nonetheless
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has
 been made. "Substantial evidence" is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable
a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court's [Conclusions of
Law (COLs)] are reviewed on appeal de novo, under the
right/wrong standard. 
COLs, consequently are not binding
upon an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their
correctness.
 
Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai 'i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705

(brackets omitted).
C. Construction of Contract
 
"The construction and legal effect to be given a
contract is a question of law freely reviewable by an
appellate court." Brown v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai' i 
226, 239, 921 P.2d 146, 159 (1996). Unconscionability is aquestion of law this court reviews de novo. See, e.g.,
[Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)] § 490:2-302(1)(2008). 
Balogh v. Balogh, 134 Hawai 'i 29, 37-38, 332 P.3d 631, 639-640 
(2014) (brackets omitted).
D. Motion for Reconsideration
 
A motion for reconsideration under Hawai 'i Family Court 
Rules (HFCR) Rule 60 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. In re 
RBG, 123 Hawai 'i 1, 16, 229 P.3d 1066, 1081 (2010) (citing Pratt 
v. Pratt, 104 Hawai 'i 37, 42, 84 P.3d 545, 550 (2004)). "An 
abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. at 16-17, 229 P.3d 1081-82 (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai
'i 202, 211,

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Enforceability of the Post-Nuptial Agreement
 
Chen argues that the family court erred in finding that
 
the Post-Nuptial Agreement was enforceable because Chen's
 
agreement was involuntary and the agreement was unconscionable.
 
As a preliminary matter, we observe that the family 
court made additional findings on the issue of voluntariness, although we did not remand on that issue in Chen. In Chen, we remanded the case "for further findings on the issue of unconscionability of the Post-Nuptial Agreement and for recalculation and redistribution of the assets." Chen, 127 
Hawai
'i at 352, 279 P.3d at 17. Despite our instructions, the 
family court appears to have issued new conclusions on voluntariness in COL 4, exceeding the scope of its powers on remand. See Standard Mgmt., Inc., 99 Hawai
'i at 137, 53 P.3d at 
276 ("When a reviewing court remands a matter with specific instructions, the trial court is powerless to undertake any proceedings beyond those specified therein." (quoting Foster v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 627 N.E.2d 285, 290 (Ill. App. Ct. 1993))). Therefore, we do not address Chen's argument that she involuntarily entered into the Post-Nuptial Agreement. 
Chen contends the family court erred in finding the
 
 
Post-Nuptial Agreement was not unconscionable.
 
 
Unconscionability encompasses two principles: one-
sidedness and unfair surprise. [Lewis v. Lewis, 69 Haw. 497,
502, 748 P.2d 1362, 1366 (1988)]. One-sidedness (i.e.,
substantive unconscionability) means that the agreement
"leaves a post-divorce economic situation that is unjustly
disproportionate." Id. Unfair surprise (i.e., procedural
unsconsionability) means that "one party did not have full
and adequate knowledge of the other party's financial
condition when the marital agreement was executed." Id. A
 
contract that is merely "inequitable" is not unenforceable.
Id. at 500, 748 P.2d at 1366. The unconscionability of an
agreement regarding the division of property is evaluated at
the time the agreement was executed. See id. at 507, 748
P.2d at 1369. 
Balogh, 134 Hawai 'i at 41, 332 P.3d at 643 (brackets and footnote 
omitted). 
Chen makes two arguments that suggest the agreement was

 
unconscionable. First, Chen states, 
The agreement was signed in 2001 when Chen was still not
 
conversant in English and could not read English very well
 
(she started school in the U.S. in 2002). No translation 
 
 
was provided to her. . . . Chen stated that she did not

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
understand what a Post-Nuptial Agreement meant at the time,
and she did NOT understand the communication between
 Hoeflinger and his attorney at the time when they were at
attorney Oda's office. She was told by Hoeflinger that the
Post-Nuptial Agreement was a "will."
 
Chen's position on appeal is that her limited English language
 
capacity made the agreement involuntary, but the lack of
 translation into Chen's primary language goes to the issue of
 procedural unconscionability rather than voluntariness. 
See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 208 cmt. d (Am.
 Law. Inst. 1981) ("Factors which may contribute to a
 finding of unconscionability in the bargaining process
 include . . . knowledge of the stronger party that the weaker
 party is unable to reasonably protect his interest by reason
 of . . . ignorance, illiteracy or inability to understand the
 language of the agreement, or similar factors."); see also
 Carmona v. Lincoln Millennium Car Wash, Inc., 171 Cal. Rptr. 3d
 42, 50-51 (Cal. Ct. App. 2014) (holding that an agreement in
 which an employer excluded a key clause in the Spanish
 translation of the agreement to employees who spoke little to no
 English added to the procedural unconscionability of the
 agreement). The family court did not make any FOFs or COLs
 regarding Chen's limited English capacity. However, Chen does
 not provide any evidence, nor does the record demonstrate, that
 Hoeflinger took advantage of Chen's lack of English language
 skills to the point that "the transaction involved elements of
 deception or compulsion, or [showed] that the weaker party had no
 meaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact assent
 or appear to assent to the unfair terms." Restatement (Second)
 of Contracts § 208 cmt. d. Therefore, Chen's argument that the
 family court erred in concluding that the Post-Nuptial agreement
 was not unconsionable is without merit. 
Second, Chen argues the family court erred in
 
concluding that it could not determine whether the Post-Nuptial
 Agreement would result in an unjustly disproportionate post-
divorce economic situation because "there is no evidence in the
 record which establishes the net value of the marital residence
 in 2001 when the parties entered into the Post-Nuptial
 Agreement." Chen argues that the proper conclusion based on such
 
9
 

 




 

 







 

 

 

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a lack of evidence should have been that the agreement was
 
 
unconscionable because Chen could not have had "full and adequate
 
 
knowledge" of Hoeflinger's financial condition. Chen does not
 
 
point to any evidence other than the uncertainty of the value of
 
 
the marital residence to support her claim that she was unaware
 
 
of Hoeflinger's financial condition at the time the Post-Nuptial
 
 
Agreement was signed.
 
 
Regarding Chen's awareness of the value of the marital
 
 
residence, which establishes whether the Post-Nuptial Agreement
 
 
led to unfair surprise and procedural unconscionability, the
 
 
family court made the following FOFs:
 
 
7. Around 2000, Thomas Artworks Unlimited was
liquidated, and the funds realized were eventually used by
the parties to invest in real estate in Hawaii. When the parties moved to Hawaii, around 2000, the money left overfrom Duntip Industries (if any) and Thomas Artwork Unlimitedwas used to purchase residential building lots on the[Hawai'i Island] and to build houses on the lots and sell
them at a profit. This was the parties' principle financialactivity from the time they came to Hawaii around 2000,until [Chen] filed for divorce in 2007. 
8. One such property was the residential property
developed and occupied by the parties themselves. This
 property, subsequently known as the "marital residence" for
purposes of the divorce litigation, became the subject of
the Post-Nuptial Agreement entered into by the parties on
June 6, 2001.
 
. . . .
 
14. As to the parties' real estate activities in
Hawaii, [Chen] testified that she was directly and
personally involved in those activities, from the
acquisition of the residential lots through the development
and eventual sale of the properties. As such, [Chen] was
certainly acquainted with any of the parties' assets
associated with their real estate activities at the time she
 signed the Post-Nuptial Agreement in June, 2001.
 
. . . .
 
17. Although the precise [net market value] of the
marital residence in June, 2001 was not established at the
trial, two conclusions are fairly established by the trialevidence. First, whatever the marital residence's value in2001, because the parties were at that time actively engagedin buying and developing [Hawai' i Island] residential
properties, they were each certainly capable of making theirown informed assessments of the property's value at the timethey entered into the Post-Nuptial Agreement. . . . 
In sum, the family court found that Chen's participation in the
 
 
acquisition and sale of properties on Hawai 'i Island gave her

 Chen's sole argument that the Post-Nuptial Agreement
 
 
was one-sided is that "[a]n unjustly disproportionate result was
 
 
expected by Hoeflinger when the agreement was executed." Chen
 
 
does not explain this argument, other than pointing to
 
 
Hoeflinger's position at trial that he expected to keep control
 
 
of the $1,150,540.70 in assets he held at the time of DOCOEPOT.
 
 
This is insufficient evidence to establish that the Post-Nuptial
 
 
Agreement was one-sided. Therefore, the family court did not err
 
 
in concluding that the Post-Nuptial Agreement was not unjustly
 
 
disproportionate.

appeal, Chen does not contend that her involvement was
 insufficient to establish her knowledge of the value of the
 marital residence, and does not otherwise point to any evidence
 suggesting that the marital residence was worth more or less than
 she was aware of at the time she signed the Post-Nuptial
 Agreement. Therefore, Chen has failed to demonstrate that the
 family court's findings regarding her knowledge of the value of
 the marital residence were clearly erroneous.
 
Furthermore, Chen fails to meet her burden of
 
 
establishing that the Post-Nuptial Agreement was unjustly
 
 
disproportionate, one-sided, and substantively unconscionable. 
 
The family court found that at the date of completion of the
 
 
evidentiary portion of the divorce trial (DOCOEPOT) in 2007, the
 
 
net market value of the Marital Residence was approximately
 
 
$368,000. The family court noted that there was evidence in the
 
 
record that suggested "the marital residence in 2001 was likely
 
 
worth somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of its 2007 value, an amount
 
 
in the range of $92,000 to $122,544." The family court then
 
 
found that despite the uncertainty in value of the marital
 
 
residence in 2001, the value "likely comprised no more than 15%
 
 
of the $890,838.41 in divisible Category 5 assets held by the
 
 
parties at the time of the DOCOEPOT."
 
 
B. Exclusion of the Marital Residence from the Marital Assets
 
Chen contends the family court erred in analyzing the
 
marital residence as a Category 1 asset and should have instead
 analyzed it as a Category 5 asset under the Marital Partnership

Principle.7 Chen asserts that the marital residence is a
 
 
Category 5 asset because there was no evidence to suggest that
 
 
Category 1 assets were used to purchase the residence, and the
 
 
residence was purchased during the marriage.
 
 
Chen appears to misunderstand the family court's
 
 
treatment of the marital residence in its distribution of assets. 
 
The family court did not categorize the property as a Category 1

 
 
asset. Rather, the court concluded that "the marital residence
 
 
is not to be considered part of the parties' divisible assets[.]"
 
 
Therefore, Chen's argument regarding the categorization of the
 
 
marital residence as a Category 5 assets lacks merit.
 
C. Motions for Reconsideration
 
On October 18, 2013, Chen submitted the Motions for
 
 
Reconsideration of the family court's denial of Chen's Motion to
 
 
Enforce the Settlement Agreement and the grant of Hoeflinger's

distribution of marital partnership property." Gordon v. Gordon, 135 Hawai' i

508, 513, 122 P.3d 288, 293, (App. 2005)). This court has divided property
 
into five categories:
 
 
Category 1: The net market value (NMV), plus or minus, of

all property separately owned by one spouse on the date of
marriage (DOM) but excluding the NMV attributable to
property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to
the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.
 
Category 2:  The increase in the NMV of all property whose

NMV on the DOM is included in category 1 and that the owner
separately owns continuously from the DOM to the date of the
conclusion of the evidentiary part of the trial (DOCOEPOT).
 
Category 3: The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or minus, of

property separately acquired by gift or inheritance during
the marriage but excluding the NMV attributable to property
that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the
other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.
 
Category 4:  The increase in the NMV of all property whose

NMV on the date of acquisition during the marriage is
included in category 3 and that the owner separately owns
continuously from the date of acquisition to the DOCOEPOT.
 
Category 5: The difference between the NMVs, plus or minus,

of all property owned by one or both of the spouses on the
DOCOEPOT minus the NMVs, plus or minus, includable in
categories 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Motion for Reimbursement.8 Although not explicitly stated, we
 
presume these motions were made pursuant to HFCR Rule 60,9
 
because they were filed more than ten days after the orders for
 
which they sought reconsideration.
 
In her opening brief in case No. CAAP-13-0005803, Chen
 
 
does not identify any bases enumerated in HFCR Rule 60 under
 
 
which she would be entitled to relief from the order denying
 
 
8 Based upon the arguments in her opening brief, Chen presumably
intended to appeal directly from the order denying Chen's Motion to Enforce
the Settlement Agreement and the order granting Hoeflinger's Motion for
Reimbursement rather than from the denials of her Motions for Reconsideration. 
The family court's orders denying Chen's Motion to Enforce the Settlement
Agreement and the order granting Hoeflinger's Motion for Reimbursement were
each entered on September 25, 2013 and Chen's notice of appeal in case no.
CAAP-13-0005803 was filed on November 27, 2013. Thus, even if Chen sought to
appeal directly from the orders rather than the denials of her Motions for
Reconsideration, the appeal would not have been timely. See HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
("When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed
within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order."). Therefore,
we consider whether Chen might have been successful in arguing the same point
with regard to the motions for reconsideration, from which the appeal would
have been timely taken.

 HFCR Rule 60 provides, in pertinent part:
 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER.
 
. . . .
 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud. On motion and upon such terms
as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's
legal representative from any or all of the provisions of a
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
reasons:
 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect;
 
(2) newly discovered evidence by which due diligence
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new
 trial under Rule 59(b) of these rules or to reconsider,
alter, or amend under Rule 59(e);
 
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated as intrinsic
or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party; 
(4) the judgment was void;
 
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or 
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment.

Chen's Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement or Hoeflinger's Motion for Reimbursement. Therefore, Chen has failed to meet her burden of establishing that the family court abused its discretion in denying the Motions for Reconsideration. See In re 
RBG, 123 Hawai

IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the (1) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
Law and Order of the Court Pursuant to the Order of the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals Filed on March 9, 2012 in S.C. No.
 28808" entered on December 17, 2012 in the Family Court of the
 Third Circuit and (2) the three post-judgment orders: (a) the
 "Order Denying Plaintiff Motion for Reconsideration to Reimburse
 Defendant for Taxes, Insurance and Road Maintenance Fees Paid on
 Marital Residence"; (b) the "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for
 Reconsideration of Enforcing the Settalement (sic) Agreement
 Between the Parties"; and (c) the "Order Denying Plaintiff's
 Motion for Granting the Extension of Time for the Appeal Period
 (Sep 25-Oct 25), In the Event of Above Motions Being Denied"
 entered on November 12, 2013 in the Family Court of the Third
 Circuit are affirmed.
