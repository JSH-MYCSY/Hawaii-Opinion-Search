MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Shannon Desiree Hill (Hill) appeals
 
from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's (Circuit Court's)
 
December 19, 2012 Judgment and seeks relief from the Circuit
 
Court's December 19, 2012 Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law;
 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against
 All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure
 (Foreclosure Decree).

I. BACKGROUND FACTS
 
On or about May 15, 2006, Hill signed a promissory note
 
for $408,000 in exchange for a loan from lender MortgageIt, Inc.
 (MortgageIt). The loan was secured by a mortgage on Hill's
 
1
 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property in Kapaa, Hawai 'i. The mortgage, which was recorded in 
the Bureau of Conveyances on May 23, 2006, named Hill as the 
borrower/mortgagor, MortgageIt as the lender, and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as the mortgagee. 
The mortgage stated that "MERS is a separate corporation that is 
acting solely as a nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns." 
On or about April 16, 2009, Countrywide Home Loans
 
Servicing LP (Countrywide), the servicer of Hill's loan, sent a
 
Notice of Intent to Accelerate, which stated that Hill was in
 
default. It stated that "default will not be considered cured
 unless Countrywide receives 'good funds' in the amount $5,286.62
 on or before May 16, 2009." 
An Assignment of Mortgage was recorded on September 21,
 
2009 in which MERS transferred its interest in the mortgage to
 BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC Home Loans). BAC Home Loans
 
merged into Bank of America in August 2011.
 
On December 9, 2011, Bank of America filed a Complaint
 
for Foreclosure in the Circuit Court. In addition to asserting
 
its interest in the mortgage by virtue of the Assignment of
 Mortgage, Bank of America also averred that it was assigned the
 promissory note and was then in possession of the note. Hill
 filed her answer on January 20, 2012, raising several affirmative
 defenses.
 
On May 22, 2012, Bank of America filed its Motion for
 
Summary Judgment Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree
 of Foreclosure. Hill opposed the motion. She argued that Bank
 of America had not demonstrated that it was the holder of the
 note or the proper assignee of the mortgage, that the assignment
 was invalid because MortgageIt had "ceased to exist" before the
 assignment was made, that the assignment was executed by a "roboÂ­signer", and that the note and mortgage were void and
 unenforceable because they were "procured by an unlicensed
 lender," i.e., MortgageIt.
 
In her memorandum in opposition to summary judgment,
 
Hill requested, if the court was not inclined to deny Bank of
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
America's motion, it should grant a continuance pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f) to allow for 
further discovery. Hill submitted a declaration as well as a declaration by her counsel to support her argument that summary judgment should be denied. Additionally, Hill attached a letter from the State of Hawai
'i Professional and Vocational Licensing 
Division, Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, which stated that a search of its records showed that MortgageIt was not issued a (mortgage broker) license before December 31, 2010, a "Certificate of Assistant Secretary of Bank of America, National Association, Manager of BAC GP, LLC," in support of the proposition that Ken Satsky (Satsky) who signed the assignment on 
behalf of MERS was an Assistant Vice President of BAC GP, LLC., 
and a January 3, 2007 press release entitled "Deutsche Bank completes acquisition of MortgageIt Holdings" to show that MortgageIt had "ceased to exist" before the assignment. 
On or about May 23, 2012, Hill sent a request for
 
production of documents to Bank of America, requesting, inter
 alia, the employment information for Satsky and Steven King
 (King), who signed a declaration in support of Bank of America's
 
Motion for Summary Judgment, and the original "wet ink"
 
promissory note. Bank of America sent back its response with
 objections. Hill then filed a Motion to Compel Plaintiff to
 Produce Documents pursuant to HRCP Rules 26 and 37 on June 29,
 2012.
 
The hearing on Bank of America's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment was held on July 3, 2012. During the hearing, Hill's
 counsel requested a continuance on the Motion for Summary
 Judgment at least until the date of the hearing on the Motion to
 Compel. However, the Circuit Court granted the Motion for
 Summary Judgment and denied the Motion to Compel, holding that
 the summary judgment rendered the Motion to Compel moot. The
 court issued its Foreclosure Decree and Judgment on December 19,
 2012. Hill timely appealed on January 18, 2013.

II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Hill contends that:
 
(1) The Circuit Court erred by granting the Motion for
 
Summary Judgment because genuine issues of material fact remained

 
in dispute as to Bank of America's standing to foreclose;
 
(2) The Circuit Court abused its discretion by taking
 
the Motion to Compel off the calendar; and
 
(3) Although not raised in the points of error, Hill
 
also argues that the court erred by declining to grant a
 continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f). 
III. 
STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. See  State ex rel. Anzai v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawai' i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai' i 
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,

depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

[T]he request must demonstrate how postponement of
a ruling on the motion will enable him or her, by
discovery or other means, to rebut the movants'
showing of absence of a genuine issue of fact. An
abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has
 clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.

IV.	 DISCUSSION
 A.	 Bank of America's Standing to Foreclose
 
"In a judicial foreclosure, a mortgagee must establish
 
its standing to foreclose. A mortgagee's standing to judicially
 foreclose may be challenged by a defending mortgagor." 
Lizza v.
 
Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co., 1 F.Supp.3d 1106, 1117 (D. Haw.
 2014) (citations omitted). A mortgagee must establish that it
 was assigned the mortgage and corresponding promissory note
 before it has the ability to foreclose. Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v.
 
Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 434, 16 P.3d 827, 839 (App. 2000) 
(plaintiff was real party in interest in foreclosure action where
 it owned the mortgage and note throughout the proceedings).
 
1.
	 Copies of the endorsed promissory note, the
mortgage, and the assignment of the mortgage, were
admissible.
 
Hill alleges that Bank of America provided insufficient
 
evidence that it holds the promissory note and was validly
 
assigned the mortgage. In connection with its motion for summary
 judgment, Bank of America provided a declaration by Assistant
 Vice President King stating that:
 
 
The information in this Declaration is taken from [Bank of
America's] business records. I have personal knowledge of
[Bank of America's] procedures for creating these records.
They are: (a) made at or near the time of the occurrence of
the matters recorded by persons with personal knowledge of
the information in the business record, or from information
transmitted by persons with personal knowledge; (b) kept in
the course of [Bank of America's] regularly conducted
business activities; and (c) it is the regular practice of
[Bank of America] to make such records.
 
5
NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
King further stated: "Plaintiff [Bank of America] is the holder
 
[of] the promissory note ('Endorsed Note') for this Loan. A true
 and correct copy of the Endorsed Note is attached as Exhibit
 'B.'" Exhibit B was a copy of the promissory note executed by
 Hill in favor of MortgageIt, which included an endorsement from
 MortgageIt to Countrywide Bank, N.A., followed by an endorsement
 from Countrywide Bank, N.A. to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., and
 another endorsement from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. in blank.
 King also attached what he declared to be true and correct copies
 of the Mortgage (Exhibit C) and the Assignment of Mortgage
 (Exhibit D).
 
Hill argues that King did not properly authenticate the 
Endorsed Note, the Mortgage, or the Assignment of Mortgage. Hawai
'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 901(a) states that "[t]he 
requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims." Hill maintains that to properly authenticate these documents, King would have needed to specifically testify that they were either the originals or copies of the originals and that they were in Bank of America's possession. However, King's declaration states that the attached Endorsed Note, Mortgage, and Assignment of Mortgage were true and correct copies and that Bank of America is the holder of the note. In addition, Hill does not put forth any cogent argument as to why King needed to testify that Bank of America was in possession of the Mortgage or Assignment of Mortgage when they were certified as true and correct copies of the records of the Bureau of Conveyances. Under HRE Rule 902(4), extrinsic evidence of authenticity is not required for certified copies of public records. Accordingly, King's statements provide "evidence sufficient to support a finding" that Exhibit B, C, and D are what he purported it to be: true and correct copies of the Endorsed Note, the Mortgage, and the Assignment of Mortgage. 
Hill's further argument that the Endorsed Note,
 
Mortgage, and Assignment of Mortgage were inadmissible hearsay is
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
without merit. See HRE Rule 801 ("'Hearsay' is a statement,
 
other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the
 
trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the
 matter asserted."); Island Directory Co., Inc. v. Iva's Kinimaka
 Enterprises, Inc., 10 Haw. App. 15, 21-22, 859 P.2d 935, 939
 (1993) ("It is well-settled that in a suit for breach of
 contract, the contract allegedly breached is not hearsay and is
 thus admissible into evidence. . . . In the instant case, the
 written document was not offered into evidence to prove the truth
 of its contents, but to prove that it was made, signed by
 [Defendant], and expressed the legal relationship of the
 parties. . . . Thus, the document was not hearsay and was
 properly admitted into evidence by the trial court.") (citations
 omitted).
 
2.	 There was no genuine issue of material fact as to
whether Bank of America was the holder of the
 note.
 
Hill argues that there is a genuine issue of material
 
fact as to whether the endorsement on the Endorsed Note occurred
 
before MortgageIt was acquired by Deutsche Bank. On a motion for
 summary judgment, "[o]nce the movant has satisfied the initial
 burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material
 fact, the opposing party must come forward, through affidavit or
 other evidence, with specific facts showing that there is a
 genuine issue of material fact." Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App.
 
56, 65, 828 P.2d 286, 292 (1991) (citing K.M. Young & Assoc.,
 Inc. v. Cieslik, 4 Haw. App. 657, 675 P.2d 793 (1983)). If the
 non-moving party fails to meet this burden, the moving party is
 entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Hall v. State,
 
7 Haw. App. 274, 284, 756 P.2d 1048, 1055 (1988); see also HRCP
 Rule 56(e).

 HRCP Rule 56(e) provides, in relevant part:
 
When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as
provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon
the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's
pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As the Endorsed Note was a negotiable instrument, Bank
 
of America is entitled to enforce the note if it is the holder. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Â§ 490:3-301 (2008). King's
 
declaration averred that Bank of America was the holder of the
 
note. As it was not the original holder, Bank of America would
 be the holder of the note only if the note was properly
 negotiated to it. "'Negotiation' means a transfer of possession,
 whether voluntary or involuntary, of an instrument by a person
 other than the issuer to a person who thereby becomes its
 holder." HRS Â§ 490:3-201(a) (2008). "Except for negotiation by
 a remitter, if an instrument is payable to an identified person,
 negotiation requires transfer of possession of the instrument and
 its indorsement by the holder." HRS Â§ 490:3-201(b) (2008). Not
 only did King's declaration state that Bank of America was the
 holder of the note and that Exhibit B was a true and correct copy
 of the Endorsed Note, but the Endorsed Note itself showed an
 unbroken line of endorsements (or "indorsements") from
 MortgageIt, the original holder, to Countrywide Bank, N.A.,
 followed by an endorsement to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., and
 finally an endorsement to no one in particular, i.e. a "blank
 indorsement".
3 An instrument endorsed in blank is payable to the
 
bearer and may be negotiated by possession alone. HRS Â§ 490:3Â­205(b) (2008). Bank of America, by offering a declaration
 attesting that it was a holder of this instrument, provided
 
2(...continued)
as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific
facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If
 the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if
appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.
 

3
 HRS Â§ 490:3-205 (2008) states:
 
(a) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an
instrument, whether payable to an identifiable person or
payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person
to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special
indorsement". . . .
 (b) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument
and it is not a special indorsement, it is a "blank
indorsement". When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes
payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of
possession alone until specially indorsed. 
8
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence that it possessed the note. See Hanalei, BRC Inc. v.
 
Porter, 7 Haw. App. 304, 309, 760 P.2d 676, 680 (1988). Bank of
 
America therefore established its prima facie claim that it was
 the holder of the note. See, e.g., In re Collins, No. 13-01783,
 
2014 WL 3725020 at *1 (Bankr. D. Haw. July 24, 2014) (creditor
 established a prima facie claim that it was the holder of a
 promissory note where it provided a copy of the note indorsed in
 blank and attached an assignment of the mortgage that secured the
 note). 
As Bank of America satisfied its initial burden, the
 
burden then shifted to Hill to set forth specific facts, as
 opposed to mere allegations, that there was a genuine issue for
 trial. HRCP Rule 56(e). Hill's argument appears to be that
 because Deutsche Bank acquired MortgageIt in 2007, there was a
 genuine issue of fact as to whether the note was endorsed before
 or after this acquisition. We reject Hill's argument that the
 MortgageIt endorsement was legally insufficient. The press
 release Hill provided does not indicate that MortgageIt dissolved
 or otherwise ceased to exist, but merely that Deutsche Bank
 acquired MortgageIt by a stock purchase and that MortgageIt would
 eventually become part of Deutsche Bank's Residential Mortgage
 Backed Securities group.
4 Hill failed to present evidence to
 
contradict Bank of America's showing that it was holder of the
 note and, therefore, did not raise a genuine issue of material
 fact. See also, e.g., In re Tyrell, 528 B.R. 790, 794 (Bankr. D.
 
Haw. 2015) (the fact that endorsements on a promissory note were
 made by payees that have subsequently gone out of business did
 not raise a genuine issue that the endorsements were forged when
 the debtor offered no evidence that the endorsements were made
 after the payees were defunct). 
4
 We note that in several lawsuits filed since 2007, MortgageIt is
identified as a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. See, e.g., IBEW Local 90 Pension
Fund v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 11 Civ. 4209 (KBF), 2013 WL 1223844 (S.D.N.Y.
Mar. 27, 2013); Davis v. MortgageIT, Inc., No. Cov. S-09-3028 FCD/GGH, 2010 WL
2943162 (E.D. Cal. July 23, 2010); Davis v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Civ. No. SÂ­09-3028 FCD/GGH, 2010 WL 1779927 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2010).
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, Hill alleges that she raised a genuine issue
 
of material fact as to who was the holder of the note when she
 
provided the court with a print out of a search conducted by her
 counsel in May 2012 on the MERS Servicer Identification System
 identifying Bank of America as the servicer of the loan and the
 investor as "Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation." However,
 even assuming that this print out is admissible, Hill offers no
 support for her assertion that an "investor" is the same as a
 note holder. This argument is without merit.
 
3.	 There was no genuine issue of material fact as to
whether the mortgage was validly assigned to Bank
of America.
 
Hill alleges that Bank of America was not validly
 
assigned the mortgage and therefore has not satisfied its burden
 
of proving standing to foreclose. 
As noted, King provided the court with copies of the
 
Mortgage and the Assignment of Mortgage. The Assignment of
 Mortgage, recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on September 21,
 2009, reads:
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Mortgage Electronic Registration
Systems, Inc., solely as nominee for Mortgageit, Inc., a New
York Corporation, does hereby transfer without recourse to
BAC HOME LOANS SERVICING, LP, a Texas limited partnership,
whose address is, C\O Bank of America fka Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc., TX, Foreclosure Department, 7105 Corporate Dr.,
MS:PTX-B-35, Plano, TX 75024, all of its right, title and
interest in and to that certain mortgage recorded on
05/23/06 in the Bureau of Conveyances, State of Hawaii,
Regular System document number 2006-095794.
 
Bank of America also provided a petition and order in the Land
 
Court of the State of Hawaii indicating that BAC Home Loans
 Servicing, LP had merged into Bank of America. Again, this
 satisfies Bank of America's burden to show that it was assigned
 the mortgage and had standing to foreclose. Hill argues,
 however, that "this Assignment is a legal impossibility where
 MERS was acting solely on behalf of its principal, MortgageIt,
 which no longer existed at the time the Assignment was executed
 and signed on its behalf."
 
As addressed above, Hill has not provided us with
 
credible evidence that MortgageIt dissolved and did not continue
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. In any case, even assuming
 
that the press release raised an issue as to whether MortgageIt
 "ceased to exist" before the assignment of the mortgage, Hill's
 argument is without merit.
 
The underlying mortgage in this case identifies MERS as 
the mortgagee and a "separate corporation that is acting solely as a nominee for Lender [MortgageIt] and Lender's successors and assigns." It also states that "Borrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS, with power of sale [the property,]" and "MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns) has the right: to exercise any or all of those interests [granted by Borrower], including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property[.]" In analyzing mortgages with similar language, the United States District Court for the District of Hawai
'i has reasoned that when a lender has entered bankruptcy or 
even dissolved prior to the assignment of the mortgage, MERS, as the mortgagee, is not prevented from assigning its interest in the mortgage. See Andrade v. US Bank Nat. Ass'n, Civil No. 13Â­
00255 LEK-KSC, 2013 WL 4552186 at *9-10 (D. Haw. Aug. 27, 2013) (in a case involving a mortgage with identical language, the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to the defendant was valid even though the original lender had declared bankruptcy before the assignment was recorded); Camat v. Fed. Nat. Mortg. Ass'n, Civil No. 12-00149 SOM/BMK, 2012 WL 2370201 at *1, *7-8 (D. Haw. June 22, 2012); Cooper v. Bank of New York Mellon, Civil No. 11Â­00241 LEK-RLP, 2011 WL 3705058 at *13 (D. Haw. Aug. 23, 2011) (analyzing identical language in a mortgage, the court held that "[u]nder this plain language, MERS had the authority to take any action required of the lender[,]" despite the fact that the lender had declared bankruptcy and dissolved before the assignment of the mortgage was recorded). The District Court's analysis is sound. 
In Camat, the plaintiff-borrower asserted that the
 
defendant improperly conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure. Camat,
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2012 WL 2370201 at *7. The underlying mortgage executed by the
 
plaintiff had identical language to the case at bar, naming MERS
 as the mortgagee and granting MERS, solely as nominee for the
 lender and its successors and assigns, the power of sale and
 foreclosure. Id. at *1-2. The lender apparently dissolved on
 
April 2, 2009. Id. at *2. Before the dissolution, on February
 
27, 2009, an Assignment of Mortgage was recorded in which MERS
 assigned the mortgage to the defendant. Id. Although it
 
appeared that the lender had dissolved after the assignment, the
 court reasoned that "even if it could be argued that [the lender]
 was dissolved earlier, that dissolution would not prevent MERS
 from transferring any interest in the mortgage." Id. at *7. 
The analysis in Kiah v. Aurora Loan Servs., LLC, Civil
 
Action No. 10-40161-FDS, 2011 WL 841282 (D. Mass. Mar. 4, 2011)
 which was cited by the court in Camat, is also persuasive. In
 Kiah, the lender had dissolved after the alleged assignment of
 the mortgage but before the date the assignment was recorded. 
Id. at *2. Regardless of when the assignment actually occured,
 the court in Kiah reasoned that:
 
The plain language of the mortgage states that MERS was
acting as nominee for [the lender] and its "successors and
assigns." . . . [The lender's] dissolution would not prevent
its successors and assigns, including [defendant], from
seeking transfer of the mortgage from MERS.
 
Accordingly, the dissolution of [the lender] would not and
could not prevent [the defendant] from obtaining an
assignment of the mortgage from MERS, both as a matter of
law and according to the arrangement that existed between
MERS and [the defendant] as a "successor and assign" of [the
lender].
 
Id. at *4. 
Here, as in Kiah and Camat, the plain language of the
 
mortgage allows MERS to transfer its interest in the mortgage as
 
the nominee of MortgageIt and its successors and assigns. Even
 if MortgageIt had ceased to exist as a separate entity before the
 assignment was recorded, MERS was not precluded from assigning
 the mortgage on behalf of MortgageIt's successor. Thus, Hill
 failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether
 Bank of America was validly assigned the mortgage. 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
4.	 The allegation of "robo-signing" does not raise a
genuine issue of material fact.
 
Hill contends that:
 
the Assignment was fraudulently "robo-signed" by an
individual named Ken Satsky who claimed under oath before a
notary for the State of Texas to be acting on behalf of
MERS, solely as a nominee for [MortgageIt], which did not
even exist, as its "Assistance Vice President". However,
Mr. Satsky is a notorious national "robo-signer," who has
previously robo-signed documents claiming authority from
many different corporations, without personal knowledge of
the matters attested to.
 
In support of this argument, Hill refers to the "Certificate of 
Assistant Secretary of Bank of America, National Association, Manager of BAC GP, LLC" to show that in addition to being an Assistant Vice President of MERS, Satsky was apparently also an Assistant Vice President of BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP. However, Hill has provided us with no discernible argument as to why this is evidence that Satsky did not have the authority to assign the mortgage on behalf of MERS, even if he may have also been an officer of BAC Home Loans. The District Court for the District of Hawai
'i, for example, has soundly rejected bare 
allegations of "robo-signing" as grounds for a claim that an assignment was invalid. Nottage v. Bank of New York Mellon, 
Civil No. 12-00418 JMS/BMK, 2012 WL 5305506 at *6 (D. Haw. Oct. 25, 2012) ("[Plaintiff] fails to explain why Rice's apparent authority to sign documents on behalf of multiple companies establishes that she did not have authority in this instance . . . . The court therefore reiterates its holding from other cases that conclusory assertions of 'robo-signing' fail to state a plausible claim [for wrongful foreclosure].") We also conclude that Hill's allegations do not raise a genuine issue as to whether the assignment was proper. 
5.	 The mortgage and note were not void and
unenforceable merely because MortgageIt was not a
licensed mortgage broker.
 
Hill maintains that the promissory note and mortgage
 
were void and unenforceable under the law in effect at the time
 
they were executed. Under HRS Â§ 454-8 (1993) (repealed effective
 Jan. 1, 2011), "[a]ny contract entered into by any person with
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
any unlicensed mortgage broker or solicitor shall be void and
 
unenforceable." A mortgage broker was defined in HRS Â§ 454-1
 (1993) (repealed effective Jan. 1, 2011) as "a person not exempt
 under section 454-2 who for compensation or gain, or in the
 expectation of compensation or gain, either directly or
 indirectly makes, negotiates, acquires, or offers to make,
 negotiate, or acquire a mortgage loan on behalf of a borrower
 seeking a mortgage loan."
 
Hill cites to Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai
'i 
289, 30 P.3d 895 (2001), for the proposition that "loans made by an unlicensed lender are completely unenforceable in judicial foreclosure actions in Hawaii." However, Kida did not hold that any loan made by a lender who was not also licensed as a mortgage broker is unenforceable. Rather, it held that "HRS Â§ 454-8 must be interpreted to invalidate only those contracts into which unlicensed mortgage brokers enter in their capacity as mortgage brokers within the meaning of HRS Â§ 454-1." Kida, 96 Hawai
'i at 
309, 30 P.3d at 915. In Kida, although a group known as The Mortgage Warehouse was designated on the loan documents as the "lender" while another entity was the "broker", The Mortgage Warehouse actually acted as the broker since it did not have any of its own funds to lend, but arranged funding from another entity and was compensated for its services in an arrangement known as "table funding". Id. at 306, 30 P.3d at 912. Unlike in 
Kida, in the present case, there is no evidence that MortgageIt was acting as a broker. 
Hill contends that:
 
Insofar as MortrgaeIt [sic] indisputably made the
subject mortgage loan for compensation or gain or in the
expectation of compensation or gain, MortrgaeIt [sic]
qualified as a "mortgage broker" requiring licensing under
Chapter 454 of the Hawaii Revised Statues [sic]. Appellee
provided no evidence to suggest that MortrgaeIt [sic] was
otherwise exempt from the licensing requirement. In fact,
MortgageIt was not licensed as a mortgage broker or mortgage
solicitor in Hawaii before December 31, 2010.
 
(Footnote omitted). Even accepting that MortgageIt was not
 
licensed as a broker, and assuming that it made the subject
 mortgage loan "for compensation or gain", we do not agree that it
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
qualified as a broker under HRS Â§ 454-1. The statute also
 
defines a mortgage broker as one who makes a loan on behalf of
 the borrower. Kida held that "we construe the phrase 'on behalf
 
of a borrower,' as set forth in HRS Â§ 454-1, as amended, to mean
 'in the interest of a borrower' or 'for the benefit of a
 borrower.'" Id. at 309, 30 P.3d at 915. However, a lender does
 
not automatically act on behalf of a borrower when it lends money
 to the borrower. McCarty v. GCP Mgmt., LLC, Civil No. 10-00133
 
JMS/KSC, 2010 WL 4812763 at *4 (D. Haw. Nov. 17, 2010). "Rather,
 it is well established that a lender acts on its own behalf in an
 arms-length loan transaction (even if a borrower might in some
 sense 'benefit' from the loan transaction)." Id. Here, the only
 
evidence is that MortgageIt acted as the lender; nothing
 indicates that it attempted to find financing for Hill from any
 other lender besides itself.
5 Absent evidence that MortgageIt
 
acted as Hill's mortgage broker, the note and mortgage are not
 void. See Wilson v. Noel, No. CAAP-12-0000098, 2015 WL 2226273
 
at *2 (Haw. App. May 12, 2015) ("Because Wind River Brokers did
 not broker Noel's mortgage loan transaction, their unlicensed
 status does not affect the validity of Noel's note and
 mortgage."); Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Padron, No. CAAP-13Â­0001153, 2015 WL 405637 at *2 (Haw. App. Jan. 29, 2015)
 (rejecting the argument that a note and mortgage were void where,
 although the lender, SecurityNational, was not a licensed
 mortgage broker, "SecurityNational was acting on its behalf as a
 lender, not on behalf of Padron as a broker."). 
B. Hill was not entitled to a continuance.
 In her memorandum in opposition to Bank of America's
 
Motion for Summary Judgment, Hill requested that the court deny
 Bank of America's motion or, in the alternative, that it grant a
 continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f). On June 29, 2012, only
 
5
 As Bank of America argues, "the loan application form Hill
attached to her declaration in support of her summary judgment opposition
identifies the entity that served as her mortgage broker for the transaction:
Pacific Mortgage Corporation[.]" Thus, it appears that Pacific Mortgage
Corporation, not MortgageIt, sought to acquire a loan on behalf of Hill and
acted as her broker. 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a few days before the July 3, 2012 hearing on the Motion for
 
Summary Judgment, Hill filed a Motion to Compel Plaintiff to
 Produce Documents. At the July 3, 2012 hearing, Hill's counsel
 verbally requested to continue the Motion for Summary Judgment at
 least until August 21, 2012, the date the Motion to Compel was
 set for a hearing. In granting the Motion for Summary Judgment,
 the court stated that "[g]iven the Court's ruling on the summary
 judgment, the motion to compel, the Court views that moot and
 will take that off calendar."
 
HRCP Rule 56(f) states:
 
Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the
motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by
affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition,
the court may refuse the application for judgment or may
order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or
depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make
such other order as is just.
 
A request for a continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f) must 
demonstrate how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable the non-moving party, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of absence of a genuine issue of fact. Acoba v. General Tire, Inc., 92 Hawai
'i 1, 9, 986 P.2d 288, 296 
(1999). "The party is required to show what specific facts further discovery might unveil." Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. 
E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai
'i 277, 308, 172 P.3d 
1021, 1052 (2007) (quoting McCabe v. Macaulay, 450 F.Supp.2d 928,
 933 (N.D. Iowa 2006)). 
To prevail under [FRCP Rule 56(f)], parties opposing a
motion for summary judgment must make (a) a timely
application which (b) specifically identifies (c) relevant
information, (d) where there is some basis for believing
that the information sought actually exists. The burden is
 on the party seeking additional discovery to proffer
sufficient facts to show that the evidence sought exists,
and that it would prevent summary judgment.

Hill first made her request for a HRCP Rule 56(f)
 
continuance in her memorandum in opposition to Bank of America's
 
Motion for Summary Judgment. The memorandum was accompanied by a
 declaration by Hill and a declaration by Hill's counsel. 
The declarations and the Motion to Compel allege that
 
King did not have the first-hand knowledge necessary to properly
 authenticate the promissory note and that Hill should be provided
 with King's employment records and "any and all corporate
 resolutions and/or powers of attorney purporting to authorize
 Steven King to act on behalf of Plaintiff as its 'Assistant Vice
 President[.]'" Hill also requested employment information for
 Satsky and Azfar Siddiqui, the notary public who notarized the
 Assignment of Mortgage, based on her belief that Satsky was a
 "robo-signer" who fraudulently signed the assignment. However,
 Hill's assertion that King did not have the first-hand knowledge
 necessary to authenticate the note appears to be based on pure
 speculation. Additionally, as noted, she has provided no facts
 which raise the issue that Satsky was a "robo-signer". Thus,
 there was no plausible basis for her claims that further
 discovery was necessary to uncover the "fraudulent" nature of the
 note and the assignment, and the Circuit Court did not need to
 permit additional discovery to support these claims. See, e.g.,
 Fifth Third Mortg. Co. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 692 F.3d 507,
 511 (6th Cir. 2012) (defendant was not entitled to a continuance
 to conduct additional discovery in support of an improbable and
 baseless claim); Blough v. Holland Realty, 574 F.3d 1084, 1091
 (9th Cir. 2009) (the district court did not abuse its discretion
 by denying a FRCP Rule 56(f) request where there was "no
 plausible basis to believe that the information sought
 exist[ed.]"); Young v. Van Buren, No. 28543, 2010 WL 4278321 at
 *5 (Haw. App. Oct. 29, 2010) (plaintiff was not entitled to a
 continuance under HRCP Rule 56(f) when he provided no basis for
 
6(...continued)
federal cases interpreting the identical version of FRCP Rule 56(f), as
persuasive to our analysis of HRCP Rule 56(f). Thomas v. Kidani
, 126 Hawai' i 
125, 130 n.5, 267 P.3d 1230, 1235 n.5 (2011). 
17
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
believing that a deposition of the defendant would yield
 
information that would rebut the defendant's showing that there
 was no genuine issue of material fact).
 
Hill also requested that Bank of America produce the
 
original "wet ink" note. However, Bank of America was not
 required to produce the original note before it could foreclose
 on Hill's property when it provided other sufficient evidence. 
Hill provided no support for the contention that Bank of America
 might not actually possess the note.
 
Hill's remaining requests for additional discovery
 
under HRCP Rule 56(f) were broad requests for information related
 to the promissory note and assignment of mortgage that do not
 illuminate the specific facts Hill sought to uncover, but were
 rather the type of broad requests that are generally insufficient
 to justify a continuance. See Young, 2010 WL 4278321 at *5 n.7
 
("We note that while parties should have a fair opportunity to
 conduct adequate discovery, the continuance of a hearing on a
 summary judgment motion cannot be based on the need to conduct a
 'fishing expedition.'").
 
Moreover, the purpose of these requests was apparently
 
to rebut Bank of America's showing that the note was properly
 negotiated and the mortgage was properly assigned. Hill sought
 to discover whether the note and mortgage were transferred after
 Deutsche Bank acquired MortgageIt and alleged that the Assignment
 of Mortgage was a forged and fraudulent document. Again, there
 is no support in the record for the claim that the Assignment of
 Mortgage, or indeed any document at issue, was forged. As to the
 assignment of the mortgage by MortgageIt, as we determined above,
 even if MortgageIt ceased to exist, by the terms of the mortgage,
 MERS was permitted to assign the mortgage on behalf of MortgageIt
 or its successors and assigns. Thus, even if Hill could uncover
 proof that the mortgage was assigned after MortgageIt ceased to
 exist, it would not rebut Bank of America's showing that the
 mortgage was properly assigned. 
In short, Hill did not meet the requirements for relief
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f). Therefore, the Circuit Court did
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not err by entering summary judgment instead of granting a
 
continuance for Hill to conduct further discovery.
