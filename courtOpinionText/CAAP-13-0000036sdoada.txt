IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
BRANDAN GRILHO, Defendant-Appellant,
and
 
WILLIAM ROSA, Defendant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-0067)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Brandan Grilho (Grilho) appeals
 
from the December 19, 2012 "Order of Re-Sentencing; Revocation of
 
Probation; Mittimus; Warrant of Commitment to Jail" (Re-
Sentencing Order) entered in the Circuit Court of the First
1
Circuit  (circuit court).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Grilho points of error as follows: 
(1)
 Grilho contends the circuit court abused its
 
discretion to revoke his probation under Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) ยง 706-625 (Supp. 2013) because his probation violations

were not "substantial[.]" The terms and conditions of Grilho's 
probationary status included requirements that Grilho: (1) follow 
all reasonable instructions given him by his probation officer; 
and (2) "[s]ubmit to urinalysis . . . a positive finding or a
failure to provide a specimen within two hours of instruction may
be considered prima facie evidence of probation violation[.]" On 
numerous occasions, Grilho failed to submit to urinalysis; when 
submitted, his urinalysis resulted in positive findings; and he 
failed to report to his probation officer as instructed. 
Grilho's repeated violation of the terms and conditions of his 
probation constituted "justifiable cause" for the circuit court's 
Re-Sentencing Order and we decline to disturb that order on 
appeal. See State v. Yamamoto, 79 Hawai 'i 511, 514, 904 P.2d 
525, 528 (1995) (an appellate court must not disturb a circuit court's decision to revoke a defendant's probation if the record 
reflects justifiable cause for the revocation). 
(2) Grilho also contends the circuit court should have
 
considered whether he posed a danger to the community and found
 
that his drug abuse problem posed such a danger. State v. Wong,
 
73 Haw. 81, 86, 829 P.2d 1325, 1327, opinion amended on
 reconsideration, State v. Wong, 73 Haw. 625, 831 P.2d 935 (1992). 
The circuit court stated that Grilho has had a "long history"
 
with methamphetamine drug use, "[a]nd that always leads to crime,
 
almost always. Okay. And that's why people rip off cars, to get
 
money to buy drugs." The circuit court did consider whether
 
Grilho posed a danger to the community. 
(3) Grilho further contends the circuit court's
 
revocation of his probationary status constitutes reversible
 
error because it is contrary to a legislative policy favoring the
 
withholding of imprisonment when appropriate. In support of his
 
contention, Grilho cites State v. Viloria, 70 Haw. 58, 62, 759
 
P.2d 1376, 1379 (1988). However, Viloria states that
 
imprisonment is one of three options the court has when the terms
 
of probation have been violated. Id.
