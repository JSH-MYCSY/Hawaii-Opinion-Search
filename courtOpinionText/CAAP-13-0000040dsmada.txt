IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL TRUST COMPANY,
A National Banking Association, As Trustee of the
IndyMac INDX Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-AR12, Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-AR12, Under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement Dated July 1, 2006, Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
 
RONALD PAJELA AMASOL and JEAN LOUISE MORALES AMASOL,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-2129)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears this
 
court lacks appellate jurisdiction because Defendants-Appellants
 
Ronald P. Amasol and Louise Jean Morales Amasol (Appellants)
 Notice of Appeal was untimely filed. Appellants appeal from the
 (1) Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and
 Writ of Possession, filed on April 12, 2012, (2) Judgment for
 Possession, filed on April 12, 2012, (3) Writ of Possession,
 filed on April 12, 2012, (4) Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to
 Reconsider Ruling, filed on December 31, 2012, and (5) denial of
 Amended Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment.

 An Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
 
Judgment and Writ of Possession was filed on April 12, 2012. A
 
Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession was also filed on
 April 12, 2013. On April 16, 2012 Appellants filed a Motion to
 Reconsider Ruling. The Motion to Reconsider Ruling was timely
 under HRCP Rule 59(e). On July 13, 2012, Appellants filed a
 Amended Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief From Judgment.
1
 
If a party files a timely motion to reconsider, the
 
time to file a notice of appeal is extended to 30 days after
 entry of an order disposing of the motion, provided however, that
 the failure to dispose of any motion by order within 90 days
 after the date of the motion was filed shall constitute a denial
 of the motion. HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). The circuit court had until
 July 17, 2012 to dispose of the Motion to Reconsider Ruling or it
 was deemed denied 90 days after filing. The circuit court did
 not enter an order disposing of the Motion to Reconsider Ruling
 until December 31, 2012. Thus, the Motion to Reconsider Ruling
 was deemed denied on July 17, 2012. Therefore, Appellants had
 until August 18, 2012 to file a Notice of Appeal. Appellants did
 not file a Notice of Appeal until January 23, 2013. 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently,
 the intermediate court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over this
 case. 
Although Appellants appeal the denial of their Amended
 
Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment, the record on appeal
 does not reflect that the circuit court entered a written order
 denying the motion. Thus, Appellants may not appeal from the
 Amended Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment. 
1
 There is nothing in the record to suggest that a Rule 60(b) Motion
for Relief From Judgment was filed by Appellants.

IT HERE HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from the 
(1) Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and
 
Writ of Possession, filed on April 12, 2012, (2) Judgment for
 Possession, filed on April 12, 2012, (3) Writ of Possession,
 filed on April 12, 2012, and (4) Order Denying Defendant’s Motion
 to Reconsider Ruling, filed on December 31, 2012, is dismissed
 for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the appeal was
 untimely. Appellants’ appeal from the Amended Rule 60(b) Motion
 for Relief from Judgment is dismissed without prejudice for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction because the circuit court has not
 entered a written order denying the motion.
