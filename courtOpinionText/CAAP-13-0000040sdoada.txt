2/This case is on remand back to this court from the Hawai# i Supreme
Court.  Based on the supreme court's opinion in this case, we will consider
all of the above orders.  Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. Amasol, 135 Hawai# i
357, 351 P.3d 584 (2015) (holding that this court has jurisdiction to consider
the Order Granting MSJ & Writ, the Judgment for Possession, and the Order
Denying Motion to Reconsider).
2("Deutsche Bank") a writ of possession for the property located
at 92-128 Kohi Place, in Kapolei, Hawai #i (the "Property").2/  
The Amasols contend that the Circuit Court (1)
erroneously granted summary judgment despite inconsistencies in
Deutsche Bank's foreclosure process and then denied
reconsideration without explanation; (2) abused its discretion by
ignoring the Amasol's Rule 60(b), Hawai #i Rules of Civil
Procedure, motion to set aside; and (3) erred in granting summary
judgment when Deutsche Bank failed to comply with the non-
judicial foreclosure statute.  For the reasons set forth below,
we vacate and remand.
We review the Circuit Court's grant or denial of
summary judgment de novo.  Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi,
136 Hawai #i 227, 240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015) (quoting Price v.
AIG Hawaii Ins. Co. , 107 Hawai #i 106, 110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005)). 
"[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions,
answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with
the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law."  Id. (quoting Price, 107 Hawai #i at
110, 111 P.3d at 5).  "The moving party, has the initial burden
of 'demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material
fact.'"  Id. (quoting Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont
De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai# i 277, 301, 172 P.3d 1021, 1045
(2007) (emphasis omitted)).  Only if the initial showing is
satisfied, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to provide
"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. " 
Id. at 240-41, 361 P.3d at 467-68 (quoting Young v. Planning
Comm'n of the Cty. of Kaua #i, 89 Hawai# i 400, 407, 974 P.2d 40, 47
(1999)).
In order to maintain an ejectment action, the plaintiff
must (1) "prove that [it] owns the parcel in issue, id. at 241,
361 P.3d at 468 (quoting State v. Magoon , 75 Haw. 164, 175, 858NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
3P.2d 712, 718-19 (1993)), meaning that [it] must have 'the title
to and right of possession of' such parcel," id. (quoting Carter
v. Kaikainahaole , 14 Haw. 515, 516 (Terr. 1902)); and (2)
"establish that 'possession is unlawfully withheld by another.'" 
Id. (quoting Carter, 14 Haw. at 516).   
Kondaur
 is dispositive in the instant case.  Here,
Deutsche Bank was both the foreclosing mortgagee and the highest
bidder at the non-judicial foreclosure sale.  Pursuant to Kondaur
and Ulrich v. Security Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Terr. 1939), in
moving for summary judgment, Deutsche Bank had the initial burden
to establish that the non-judicial foreclosure sale was conducted
in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, and in good
faith, and to demonstrate that an adequate price was procured for
the property.  See Kondaur , 136 Hawai #i at 243, 361 P.3d 470.
As in Kondaur , the Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure
Under Power of Sale prepared and submitted by Deutsche Bank's
counsel fails to provide any evidence that would point us to that
conclusion.  Similar to the affidavit in Kondaur, the affidavit
of sale here does not attest to anything concerning the adequacy
of the purchase price.  Kondaur , 136 Hawai #i at 242-43, 361 P.3d
at 469-70; see also JPMorgan Chase Bank, Nat'l Ass'n v. Benner,
137 Hawai #i 326, 328, 372 P.3d 358, 360. (App. 2016) (finding a
similar foreclosure affidavit insufficient to establish that the
sale was conducted in a fair, reasonably diligent, good faith
manner, and that the purchase price was adequate ); Bank of New
York Mellon v. Lizarraga, No. CAAP-12-0000769, 2016 WL 3199431 at
*6 (Haw. Ct. App. June 8, 2016) (same). 
Deutsche Bank failed to satisfy its initial burden of
showing that the foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner that
was fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and that it had
obtained an adequate price for the Property.  Therefore, the
burden did not shift to the Amasols to raise genuine issues of
material fact, and the Circuit Court erred in granting summary
judgment. 
Accordingly, we vacate the Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of Possession Filed
December 27, 2011, filed on April 12, 2012, and the Judgment forNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
4Possession, filed on April 12, 2012.  The case is remanded to the
Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
