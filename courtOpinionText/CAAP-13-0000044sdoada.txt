IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SHERMAN LAVELLE SHAW, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-1053)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Sherman Lavelle Shaw (Shaw)
 
appeals, pro se,1
 from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
for the offense of Attempted Theft in the Second Degree in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-831 (Supp.
 2013)
2	 and HRS § 705-500 (1993)3
 entered by the Circuit Court of
1 On June 14, 2013, this court remanded this case for a
determination of whether Shaw validly waived his right to counsel and wished
to proceed in this appeal pro se.  The Circuit Court of the First Circuit, the
Honorable Randal K.O Lee, conducted a colloquy with Shaw and determined that
Shaw voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently elected to proceed pro se on
 
appeal.

 HRS § 708-831 provides in pertinent part:
 
§708-831 Theft in the second degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the second degree if the
person commits theft:
 
(a)	 Of property from the person of another;
 
(b)	 Of property or services the value of which
exceeds $300;
 
. . . .

the First Circuit (Circuit Court) on January 17, 2013.4
 
On appeal, Shaw apparently argues that: (1) there was
 
insufficient evidence to support his conviction; and (2) he was
 
denied effective assistance of counsel.5
 
Shaw's first point of error on appeal, insufficiency of
 
the evidence, in and of itself implies a searching review by the
 appellate court of the evidence adduced at Shaw's jury trial.

2(...continued)
(2) Theft in the second degree is a class C felony. A
 
person convicted of committing the offense of theft in the
second degree under [subsection (1)](c) and (d) shall be
sentenced in accordance with chapter 706, except that for
the first offense, the court may impose a minimum sentence
of a fine of at least $1,000 or two-fold damages sustained
by the victim, whichever is greater.
 
3	 HRS § 705-500 provides:
 
§705-500 Criminal attempt.  (1) A person is guilty of
an attempt to commit a crime if the person:
 
(a)	 Intentionally engages in conduct which would
constitute the crime if the attendant
 circumstances were as the person believes them
to be; or
 
(b)	 Intentionally engages in conduct which, under
the circumstances as the person believes them to
be, constitutes a substantial step in a course
of conduct intended to culminate in the person's
commission of the crime.
 
(2) When causing a particular result is an element
of the crime, a person is guilty of an attempt to commit the
crime if, acting with the state of mind required to
establish liability with respect to the attendant
circumstances specified in the definition of the crime, the
person intentionally engages in conduct which is a
substantial step in a course of conduct intended or known to
cause such a result.
 
(3) Conduct shall not be considered a substantial step
under this section unless it is strongly corroborative of
the defendant's criminal intent.

 In considering whether evidence adduced at trial is sufficient to
support a conviction, we are guided by the following principles:
 
On appeal, the test for a claim of insufficient evidence is
whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to
the State, there is substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. State v. Ildefonso, 72
Haw. 573, 576, 827 P.2d 648, 651 (1992); State v. Tamura, 63
(continued...)

Although the record on appeal contains the court file and the
 
exhibits admitted into evidence at trial, Shaw has failed to
 include any transcripts of the trial itself in the record on
 appeal.
 
HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(A) places on the appellant the
 
affirmative burden of providing the transcript of the
 proceedings: 
When an appellant desires to raise any point on appeal that
requires consideration of the oral proceedings before the
court appealed from, the appellant shall file with the
appellate clerk, within 10 days after filing the notice of
appeal, a request or requests to prepare a reporter’s
transcript of such parts of the proceedings as the appellant
deems necessary that are not already on file.
 
Thus, it is well settled that "'[t]he burden is upon appellant in
 
an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record,
 and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate
 transcript.'" 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt , 80 Hawai 'i 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v.
 The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))
 (brackets omitted). As there are no transcripts of proceedings
 here, Shaw has failed to carry his burden.
 
Similarly, Shaw has failed to establish his counsel
 
provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The proper standard
 for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal is
 whether, "viewed as a whole, the assistance provided was within
 the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases." 
6(...continued)
Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981). "'It matters not
 
if a conviction under the evidence as so considered might be
deemed to be against the weight of the evidence so long as
there is substantial evidence tending to support the
requisite findings for the conviction.'" 
Ildefonso , 72 Haw.
at 576-77, 827 P.2d at 651 (quoting Tamura, 63 Haw. at 637,
633 P.2d at 1117). "'Substantial evidence' . . . is
 credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and
probative value to enable a man of reasonable caution to
reach a conclusion." See id. 72 Haw. at 577, 827 P.2d at
651 (quoting State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 565, 617 P.2d
820, 823 (1980)).
 
State v. Matias
, 74 Haw. 197, 207, 840 P.2d 374, 379 (1992). "Furthermore,
'it is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issuesdependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of theevidence[.]'" Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 239, 900 P.2d 1293, 1306
(1995) (citation omitted).

Dan v. State, 76 Hawai 'i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient and every
action or omission is not subject to inquiry. Specific
actions or omissions alleged to be error but which had an
obvious tactical basis for benefitting the defendant's case
will not be subject to further scrutiny. If, however, the
action or omission had no obvious basis for benefitting the
defendant's case and it "resulted in the withdrawal or
 substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious
defense," then it will be evaluated as information that an
ordinary competent criminal attorney should have had. 
Id. (ellipses and brackets omitted; emphases in original) 
(quoting Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)). "[M]atters presumably within the judgment of counsel, like trial strategy, will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 39-40, 960 P.2d 
1227, 1247-48 (1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Shaw has not provided the transcripts that would allow us to conduct this review. Moreover, the court minutes reflect he was present for one date he identifies (October 11, 2011), which was a motion in limine and the other, for which he was not present (October 10, 2011), was for a status conference and Shaw does not state why his absence was an error or omission of counsel that substantially impaired a potentially meritorious defense. See State v. Smith, 
106 Hawai
'i 365, 377, 105 P.3d 242, 254 (App. 2004) (not 
ineffective assistance to waive defendant's presence at settling of jury instructions); see also, Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 43(c) ("A defendant need not be present either physically or by video conference if . . . (2) the proceeding is a conference or argument upon a question of law[.]"). Shaw also does not identify the witnesses he claims counsel failed to contact and, more importantly, does not state, let alone present a sworn

statement, regarding what those witnesses would have testified to 
at trial. See Smith, 106 Hawai 'i at 378, 105 P.3d at 255. 
Therefore, the January 17, 2013 Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
