IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
SHIRLEY PISO PICO, Claimant-Appellant, v.
KAPIOLANI MEDICAL CENTER FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN, nka
HAWAII PACIFIC HEALTH, Employer-Appellee, Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2012-347)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Claimant-Appellant Shirley P. Pico (Pico) appeals pro 
se from the January 24, 2013 Decision and Order of the Labor and 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (Appeals Board), which 
affirmed the July 19, 2012 decision of the Director of Labor and 
Industrial Relations (Director) denying Pico's request to reopen 
five workers' compensation claims for injuries that allegedly 
occurred on October 25, 1997, January 20, 1998, November 27, 1998, January 11, 1999, and July 8, 1999. 
Pico's opening brief does not comply with the 
requirements of Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28 
including, importantly, that it fails to identify any points of error or cite to the record on appeal. We, nevertheless, have attempted to review the merits of Pico's arguments. 
See O'Connor NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai 'i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994) ("the policies of this court are to permit litigants to 
appeal and to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible") (citations omitted); see also Hawaiian Props., Ltd. v. Tauala, 125 Hawai
'i 176, 181 n.6, 254 P.3d 487, 492 n.6 (App. 
2011). 
The gravamen of Pico's appeal is her contention that
 
the Appeals Board erred when it declined to reopen her workers'
 compensation claims against Employer-Appellee Kapiolani Medical
 Center for Women and Children, nka Hawaii Pacific Health, Self-
Insured (HPH). Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve Pico's arguments on appeal as
 follows:
 
The supreme court has held that "unchallenged factual
 
findings are deemed to be binding on appeal[.]" Okada Trucking
 
Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawaii 450, 459, 40 P.3d 73, 82
 (2002). 
Pico has not challenged the Appeals Board's findings of
 
fact, which include that, on November 3, 2000, Pico, who was then
 represented by an attorney, entered into a Compromise and
 Settlement Agreement and Release (Settlement Agreement), which
 
provided for "a full and final resolution of all five injury
 
claims" in the cases that Pico now seeks to reopen. As stated by
 the Appeals Board, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Pico
 received a sum of $25,000, less approved attorney's fees, Pico's

claims were considered non-compensable by all parties, and Pico
 
agreed to waive all her rights under Chapter 386, Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) for workers' compensation benefits, including her
 
reopening rights under HRS ยง 386-89, as well as any further
 
claims allegedly resulting from the five claims. The Settlement
 Agreement was approved by the Appeals Board on November 21, 2000.
 
On November 3, 2008, the Appeals Board entered a prior
 
Decision and Order, which concluded, inter alia, that the
 Settlement Agreement was validly executed and approved, and
 precluded Pico from reopening the five workers' compensation
 claims. It is undisputed that no appeal was taken from that
 November 3, 2008 Decision and Order.
 
Res judicata, or claim preclusion, is a doctrine that 
limits "a litigant to one opportunity to litigate aspects of the case to prevent inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to promote finality and judicial economy." Bremer v. Weeks, 
104 Hawai
'i 43, 53, 85 P.3d 150, 160 (2004) (footnote omitted). 
Res judicata "prohibits a party from relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action." Id. (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). We conclude that, under the doctrine of res judicata, Pico is barred from relitigating the preclusive effect of the Settlement Agreement on her attempts to reopen her five workers' compensation claims.
