GENEVIEVE WALKER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC12-1-608)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Genevieve Marie Walker (Walker)
 
appeals pro se from the January 8, 2013 Judgment entered in the
 
1
District Court of the First Circuit  (district court) in favor of
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Integrated Health Resources, LLC, dba Leeward

 
Integrated Health Services (Integrated Health).
 
We construe Walker's points of error as contentions

 
that the district court erred in:
 
(1) overlooking issues of law regarding the proper
 
standard for vacating default judgment based on lack of personal
 
jurisdiction;
 
(2) entering default judgment because an answer and
 
counterclaim had been timely filed;
 
(3) entering default judgment because default judgments
 
are disfavored and any doubt should be resolved in favor of the

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
party seeking relief from entry of default so that, in the
 
interests of justice, there can be a trial on the merits;
 
(4) entering default judgment in violation of Hawai 'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 54(c) because Walker was deprived 
of notice of the scope of the claim and a meaningful opportunity 
to defend against it; 
(5) entering default judgment because it was void for
 
affecting life, liberty, or property rights and due process; and
 
(6) entering default judgment without providing her
 
with reasonable accommodations.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Walker was admitted to Integrated Health's nursing 
facility located in Waianae, Hawai 'i on April 8, 2011. Upon 
admission, Walker's daughter and attorney-in-fact Michelle Walker-Cook (Walker-Cook) signed an agreement as the "responsible 
party" for Walker, promising to pay for the charges assessed by 
the facility. In a letter dated October 19, 2011, Integrated Health sent Walker an invoice for its services rendered between May 8, 2011 and June 15, 2011, totaling $8,518.50. 
On January 31, 2012, Integrated Health filed a
 
complaint in district court seeking from Walker "[p]rincipal in
 the amount of $8,518.50, interest of $526.69, and service fees of
 $40.00 pursuant to contract for services rendered." The district
 court entered an order striking the Return of Service, stating
 "Name of [the] person receiving 'substitute' service must be
 stated."
 
On February 21, 2012, Walker filed her "Answer and

 
Counterclaim" (Answer and Counterclaim). On February 28, 2012,
 
Walker-Cook filed an "Answer and Counterclaim," for which the
 
district court immediately entered an order striking the pleading
 because "Defendant is Genevieve Walker. If another person other
 than an attorney is representing her, [that person] must show
 proof that circuit court has approved that person as guardian of
 the person." On March 15, 2012, Walker filed a notice of appeal
 from the order striking Walker-Cook's Answer and Counterclaim in
 case no. CAAP-12-0000172. On May 31, 2012, this court dismissed
 the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 5, 2012, Integrated Health filed a Return of
 
Service, indicating that substitute service was made to "Charles
 
Cook, adult grandson of Genevieve Walker."2
 
On March 16, 2012, Integrated Health filed a motion to
 
dismiss Walker's Counterclaim (Motion to Dismiss). In response,
 
Walker filed a "Notice of Opposition to [Integrated Health's]
 
Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim via Motion to Strike and for
 Sanctions" in which she indicated that she would file a "formal
 opposition" by April 30, 2012. Walker did not file an opposition
 to the Motion to Dismiss or a motion to strike and for sanctions. 
On April 5, 2012, the district court held a hearing on
 
Integrated Health's Motion to Dismiss. Walker was not present at
 the hearing, and the district court dismissed Walker's
 counterclaim without prejudice. On May 2, 2012, the district
 court entered an order granting Integrated Health's Motion to
 Dismiss.
 
On September 26, 2012, Walker filed "Defendant's
 
Renewed Request for Accommodations Under the Americans with
 Disabilities Act Pursuant to Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 and
 §§ 504 and 701 of the Rehabilitation Act and Stay of the
 Proceedings Including the Status Conference of September 27, 2012
 to Ensure Defendant's Right to a Fair Trial" (Request for
 
3
Accommodations).  In her Request for Accommodations, Walker
 
stated, 

To date, despite numerous requests by phone, in writing and
by the formal request, [Walker] has sought [Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)] accommodations as she is
bedridden, cannot leave her hospice, is profoundly deaf,
almost totally blind, suffers from terminal illness
including, but not limited to leukemia, acute stenosis,
stroke syndrome, severe osteoporosis, etc. as memorialized
in [Walker's] original Request for ADA Accommodations.
 
2 Walker notes in her opening brief:
 
Charles Cook is not competent to accept serve [sic] onanyone's behalf including his own person because he is anidentified SSI and SSDI recipient adult person with anorganic brain disorder also known as schizophrenia who has alegal Guardian . . . appointed by a foreign court and aPetition for Permanent Guardianship is pending before theCircuit Court of the First District Family Division,Hawai'i. 
3 The record does not contain evidence of an initial request for
accommodations.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
There is no response to Walker's Request for Accommodations in
 
the record.
 
In a letter dated October 15, 2012, the Clerk of the
 
Court for the district court informed Walker that case had "been
 scheduled by the court for status [on] Thursday, October 25, 2012
 at 9:00 a.m. in the Ewa District Court[.]" Walker did not appear
 at the status conference.
 
On January 8, 2013, Integrated Health filed an ex parte
 
motion for default judgment (Motion for Default Judgment) based
 
on Walker's failure to appear at the "Answer Hearing" on October
 
25, 2012. The district court granted the motion and entered the
 Judgment against Walker on the same day.
 
On January 31, 2013, Walker filed a notice of appeal
 
from the Judgment.
 
II.
 STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Default Judgment
 
"Application of HRCP Rule 55, which governs entry of 
default judgment, is reviewed for abuse of discretion." Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Hawaii, Ltd.
, 100 Hawai 'i 149, 
158, 58 P.3d 1196, 1205 (2002). The same standard applies to application of District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) 
4
Rule 55,  which governs entry of default judgment in district
court proceedings. See id.
 at 159, 58 P.3d at 1206. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Walker argues the Motion for Default Judgment is "void
 
ab initio and should be vacated and the holding reversed." The
 Judgment states Walker "failed to plead or otherwise defend and a
 default was entered upon proof that [Walker] is indebted to
 [Integrated Health]."
 
"In order to determine whether the district court
 
properly entered default against [a defendant] . . . it is
 
4 DCRCP Rule 55 provides, in pertinent part:
 
RULE 55. DEFAULT.
 
(a)
 Entry. When a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or
otherwise defend as provided by these rules, and the fact is
made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall
enter that party's default.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
necessary to determine whether [the defendant] 'failed to plead 
or otherwise defend as provided by [the DCRCP.]'" First Hawaiian 
Bank v. Powers, 93 Hawai 'i 174, 183, 998 P.2d 55, 64, (App. 2000) 
(quoting DCRCP Rule 55(a)). "Some courts have properly recognized that Rule 55(a)'s 'otherwise defend' language may not be extended to justify a dismissal once there has been an initial responsive pleading or an initial action that constitutes a defense."  Id. at 185, 998 P.2d at 66 (quoting 10 Moore's Federal 
Practice § 55.10 [2][b] at 55-12.1 (3d ed. 1998)); see Gonsalves, 100 Hawai
'i at 159, 58 P.3d at 1206. 
On February 21, 2012, Walker filed her Answer and
 
Counterclaim. On April 27, 2012, Integrated Health filed a
 motion to dismiss Walker's Counterclaim, to which Walker
 submitted a "Notice of Opposition to [Integrated Health's] Motion
 to Dismiss Counterclaim via Motion to Strike and for Sanctions."
 On April 27, 2012, Walker also submitted a "Notice of Filing of
 Motion for Reconsideration and for Sanctions." On September 26,
 2012, Walker filed her Request for Accommodations.
 
This court has vacated default judgments where the 
defendant has filed an answer. See, e.g. Powers, 93 Hawai
'i at 
184-85, 998 P.2d at 65-66; Mahler v. Cty. of Hawaii Real Prop. Tax Div., No. 29711 at *5 (App. Dec. 17, 2009) (mem.). Here, Walker submitted an answer and other documents. Although Walker submitted notices of motions she intended to file without subsequently filing the motions, the district court was wrong to conclude that Walker "ha[d] failed to plead or otherwise defend" the lawsuit. 
The district court's error is particularly pronounced
 
because it informed Walker by letter dated October 15, 2012 that
 the hearing on October 25, 2012 was to be a status conference.
 However, in its Motion for Default Judgment, Integrated Health
 indicated that Walker failed to appear at the "Answer Hearing on
 October 25, 2012." The district court entered judgment against
 Walker because she "failed to plead or otherwise defend" the
 lawsuit based solely on her failure to appear at, premised on the
 information provided to Walker, a single status conference. Such
 an action by a defendant does not warrant a default judgment

against him or her, and it is clear that the district court
 
abused its discretion. See Gonsalves,  100 Hawai 'i at 158, 58 
P.3d at 1205. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Therefore, the Judgment entered on January 8, 2013 in
 
the District Court of the First Circuit is vacated and this case
 is remanded for proceedings consistent with this Memorandum
 Opinion.
