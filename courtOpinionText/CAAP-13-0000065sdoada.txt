APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS PRISONER NO. 12-1-0045
(CRIMINAL NO. 85-1261))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Lonnell Reginald Wideman appeals from a January 14,
 
2013 "Order Denying And Dismissing Petition To Vacate, Set Aside,
 
Or Correct Judgment Or To Release Petition From Custody" entered
 
1
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
Wideman's Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 40 
petition (Rule 40) contended the Hawai' i Paroling Authority (HPA) 
unlawfully revoked his parole for not reporting contact with law 
enforcement to his parole officer. Wideman's Rule 40 petition 
also alleged various procedural irregularities by the HPA as well

as ineffectiveness of counsel. Wideman makes similar points and
 
arguments on appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Wideman's appeal is without merit.
 
The record in this case shows Wideman failed to report
 
contact with law enforcement in violation of a condition of his
 
parole. The record also indicates his parole revocation
 
proceedings were pursuant to the applicable statutes and rules
 
that govern such proceedings. In addition, there is nothing in
 
the record to suggest his counsel was ineffective.
 
The circuit court dismissal and denial of Wideman's
 
Rule 40 petition as patently frivolous and without a trace of
 
support in either the record or evidence submitted by Wideman, or
 
in his allegations and arguments, was not erroneous.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 14, 2013 "Order
 
Denying And Dismissing Petition To Vacate, Set Aside, Or Correct
 Judgment Or To Release Petition From Custody" entered in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 23, 2013.
