STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 12-1-0057 ; CRIMINAL NOS. 04-1-0043,
04-1-0955, 06-1-2266, AND 07-1-0876)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Mario Mandell Sobala (Sobala)
 
appeals from the Order Denying and Dismissing Petition to Vacate,
 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from
 Custody; Notice of Entry (Order Denying Petition), which was
 
entered on January 2, 2013, by the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court).

Sobala was charged with various counts in Criminal Nos.
 
04-1-0043, 04-1-0955, 06-1-2266, and 07-1-0876. In 2005, Sobala
 was convicted in the earlier two cases and sentenced to
 probation. In 2007, the State moved to revoke probation and
 Sobala was arrested.
 
On January 2, 2008, Sobala filed a motion for
 
supervised release in all four cases. On January 18, 2008,
 Sobala pled guilty in the latter two cases and, on the same day,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his probation was revoked in the earlier two cases. On January
 
24, 2008, the Circuit Court entered an order setting aside
 Sobala's bail and establishing terms and conditions of release in
 all four cases.
 
On March 11, 2008, the State filed a motion for
 
sentencing of a repeat offender in the latter two cases and a
 motion for consecutive term sentencing in Criminal No. 07-1-0876.
 
In June of 2010, the State moved for revocation of
 
Sobala's supervised release.
 
On August 2, 2010, Sobala was resentenced in Criminal
 
Nos. 04-1-0043 and 04-1-0955, and sentenced in Criminal Nos. 06­1-2266 and 07-1-0876. Of particular significance to the issues
 on this appeal, on August 24, 2010, in Criminal No. 06-1-2266,
 the Circuit Court sentenced Sobala as a repeat offender, pursuant
 to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) HRS § 706-606.5 (2014), to a
 mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years and four
 months. In addition, on August 24, 2010, in Criminal No. 07-1­0876, after considering the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606
 (2014), and pursuant to HRS § 706-668.5 (2014), the Circuit Court
 ordered that a consecutive sentence was warranted and necessary
 to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, promote respect for
 the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal
 conduct, and protect the public from further crimes of Sobala. 
In Criminal No. 07-1-0876, the Circuit Court also sentenced
 Sobala as a repeat offender based on his earlier convictions in
 Criminal Nos. 04-1-0043 and 04-1-0955.
 
On October 23, 2012, Sobala filed a petition pursuant 
to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40, contending 
that his consecutive mandatory mininum sentences were illegal and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Sobala's petition was denied. 
On appeal, Sobala contends that: (1) the Circuit Court
 
erred when it dismissed his petition without first considering
 his reply brief; (2) under the circumstances of this case, the
 Circuit Court erred when it imposed a mandatory term of
 imprisonment in Criminal No. 07-1-0876 to run consecutive to the
 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
mandatory minimum term imposed in Criminal No. 06-1-2266; and (3)
 
he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel
 failed to recognize, advise him of, and object to the purportedly
 illegal sentence.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant rules, statutes, and case law, we resolve
 Sobala's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court did not err by failing to
 
consider Sobala's Reply Brief. Sobala points out that the Order
 Denying Petition specifically referenced the Petition and Answer
 but not his Reply Brief when denying the Petition. Thus, Sobala
 claims that the Circuit Court failed to consider his Reply Brief
 before denying the Petition. HRPP Rule 40 does not allow for a
 reply brief to be filed. In addition, the Order Denying Petition
 also stated that the Circuit Court reviewed "the files and
 records herein." The Reply Brief was part of the court files at
 the time it issued the Order Denying Petition. Accordingly, we
 conclude that Sobala's assertion of error is without merit.
 
(2) Citing State v. Shamblin, Nos. 29314 and 29315,
 
2011 WL 822656 (Haw. App. Mar. 9, 2011) (mem.), 2011 WL 822656
 (Hawaii App.), Sobala contends that the imposition of mandatory
 minimum sentences in Criminal Nos. 06-1-2266 and 07-1-0876,
 pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5, was improper because he did not have
 two prior convictions. Sobala notes that the sentences for both
 Criminal Nos. 06-1-2266 and 07-1-0876 were issued at the same
 time, thus, the convictions in either one cannot be considered a
 "prior" conviction to the other in order to satisfy HRS § 706­606.5. 
Sobala, citing State v. Cornelio, 84 Hawai
'i 476, 935 
P.2d 1021 (1997), also claims that HRS § 706-606.5 prohibits imposition of consecutive mandatory minimum sentences in this case. Sobala relies upon the portion of HRS § 706-606.5(5) which states: "The sentencing court may impose the above sentences consecutive to any sentence imposed on the defendant for a prior 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conviction, but such sentence shall be imposed concurrent to the
 
sentence imposed for the instant conviction." (emphasis added).
 
In this case, Sobala's convictions in Criminal Nos. 
06-1-2266 and 07-1-0876 were entered at the same time. However,
 the Circuit Court relied upon Sobala's two prior convictions in
 Criminal Nos. 04-1-0043 and 04-1-0955 to satisfy the requirements
 of HRS § 706-606.5. Thus, Shamblin is inapplicable. Shamblin,
 
2011 WL 822656 at *6. 
Cornelio held that "HRS § 706-606.5 divests a 
sentencing court of the authority to impose consecutive mandatory minimum periods of imprisonment on a defendant convicted of multiple felony counts charged in the same indictment or complaint." Cornelio, 84 Hawai
'i at 494, 935 P.2d at 1039 
(emphasis added). In this case, Sobala's convictions in Criminal Nos. 06-1-2266 and 07-1-0876 stemmed from different felony information charges. Thus, Cornelio is not applicable and HRS § 706-606.5(5) did not prohibit the Circuit Court from imposing consecutive mandatory minimum sentences in this case. Sobala's sentencing fell within the general sentencing statute of HRS § 706-668.5 which allows for imposition of concurrent or consecutive terms of imprisonment, upon consideration of the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606. For these reasons, we conclude that Sobala's consecutive mandatory minimum sentences were not illegal. 
(3) As we have concluded that his sentences were not
 
illegal, Sobala's trial counsel did not provide ineffective
 assistance of counsel by failing to inform Sobala that his
 sentence was illegal.
