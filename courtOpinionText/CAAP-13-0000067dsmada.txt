Appellant Ronald E. Evans's (Appellant Evans) April 15, 2013 
memoranda in opposition to Appellees STR Painting and Appellee Fireman's Fund Insurance Company's motion to dismiss, and (3) the record, it appears that we do not have jurisdiction over Appellant Evans's appeal from the State of Hawai» i Labor and 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (the LIRAB)
1 December 28, 
2012 decision and order dismissing Appellant Evans's appeal. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
 
(Supp. 2012) and HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012), an aggrieved
 party may appeal a decision or order by the LIRAB directly to the
 
intermediate court of appeals.
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children , 89 
Hawai» i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court of Hawai» i 
has "held that an order that finally adjudicates a benefit or 
penalty under the worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." 
Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co. , 104 Hawai» i 164, 168, 86 
P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (citation omitted). "[A] workers' compensation case . . . is an ongoing proceeding[;] . . . an

inherent and unique characteristic of a workers' compensation
 
case is its piecemeal nature." Id. at 169, 86 P.3d at 978
 
(citation omitted; brackets and ellipsis points in original). 
The LIRAB's December 28, 2012 decision and order finally ended
 the proceedings by dismissing Appellant Evans's appeal, leaving
 nothing further to be accomplished. Therefore, the LIRAB's
 December 28, 2012 decision and order is "a final decision and
 order in a contested case" under HRS § 91-14(a) that is
 appealable directly to the intermediate court of appeals pursuant
 to HRS § 386-88. 
The LIRAB additionally entered a January 2, 2013 
decision and order dismissing Appellant Evans's appeal. It appears that the LIRAB's entry of the January 2, 2013 decision 
and order was an administrative error. More importantly, however, under analogous circumstances involving a judgment and 
an amended judgment, the Supreme Court of Hawai» i explained the 
following general rule: 
The general rule is that where a judgment is amended in a
material and substantial respect, the time within which an
appeal from such determination may be taken begins to run
from the date of the amendment, although where the amendment
relates only to the correction of a clerical error, it does
not affect the time allowed for appeal.
 
Poe v. Hawai» i Labor Relations Board, 98 Hawai» i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis
 
points omitted; emphasis added); State v. Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai» i 
235, 246 n.6, 178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 (2008). Furthermore,
 
[i]f the amendment of a final judgment or decree for the
purpose of correcting a clerical error either materially
alters rights or obligations determined by the prior
judgment or decree or creates a right of appeal where one
did not exist before, the time for appeal should be measured
from the entry of the amended judgment. If, however, the
amendment has neither of these results, but instead makes
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
changes in the prior judgment which have no adverse effect
upon those rights or obligations or the parties  right to
appeal, the entry of the amended judgment will not postpone
the time within which an appeal must be taken from the
original decree.
 
Poe v. Hawai» i Labor Relations Board , 98 Hawai» i at 418, 49 P.3d 
at 384 (citations, internal quotation marks, and original 
brackets omitted; emphasis added). The January 2, 2013 decision 
and order did not amend the December 28, 2012 decision and order 
in a material and substantial respect, because the January 2, 
2013 decision and order merely repeated the same adjudication that the LIRAB had already expressed in the December 28, 2012 
decision and order, namely that the LIRAB dismissed Appellant 
Evans's appeal as untimely. Therefore, the mailing of the December 28, 2012 decision and order triggered the thirty-day 
time period under HRS § 386-88 for filing a notice of appeal, and the mailing of the January 2, 2013 decision and order did not 
postpone the time within which an appeal could be taken. 
HRS § 386-88 required Appellant Evans to file his
 
notice of appeal within thirty days after the December 28, 2012
 mailing of the December 28, 2012 decision and order:
 
The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final
and conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless
within thirty days after mailing  of a certified copy of the
decision or order, the director or any other party appeals
to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602,
by filing  a written notice of appeal with the appellate
board.
 
HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2012) (quoted in part; emphases added). 
Although court procedural rules, such as Rule 6(e) of the Hawai» i 
Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 26(c) of the Hawai» i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure, add two additional days to a prescribed time period whenever the time period is measured from service by mail, 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the instant case took place before the LIRAB instead of a court, 
and the governing procedural rules for LIRAB matters, HAR § 12­47-51 (2012) and HAR § 12-47-18 (2012), do not add two additional days for service by mail. Appellant Evans did not file his January 29, 2013 notice of appeal within thirty days after the December 28, 2012 mailing of the LIRAB's December 28, 2012 decision and order, as HRS § 386-88 required. Therefore, Appellant Evans's appeal is untimely. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts 
cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees STR Painting and
 
Appellee Fireman's Fund Insurance Company's February 11, 2013
 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-13-0000067 for
 
lack of jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court case number
 CAAP-13-0000067 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
