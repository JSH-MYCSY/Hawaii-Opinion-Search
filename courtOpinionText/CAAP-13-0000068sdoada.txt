IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KANIAULONO ANZAI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
SOUTH KOHALA DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 3DCW-12-0000207)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kaniaulono Anzai (Anzai) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, entered on
 
January 9, 2013 in the District Court of the Third Circuit, South
 Kohala Division (District Court).
1
 
Anzai was convicted of Theft (Shoplifting), in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 708-830(8) (2014)
 and 708-833(1) (2014).
 
On appeal, Anzai contends (1) the charge was deficient
 
for failing to include the statutory definition of "intent to
 defraud" as defined in HRS § 708-800 and (2) the District Court
 erred by denying his request for a continuance made immediately
 prior to trial thereby depriving him of his alibi defense.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Anzai's points of error as follows:
 
1
 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) For the first time on appeal, Anzai claims the
 
charge failed to state an essential element of the offense, the
 
statutory definition of "intent to defraud," and failed to inform
 him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
 
The charge was not deficient for failing to state the 
statutory definition of "intent to defraud," as defined in HRS § 708-800 (2014). "Intent to defraud" is defined as "(1) An intent to use deception to injure another's interest which has value; or (2) Knowledge by the defendant that the defendant is facilitating an injury to another's interest which has value." HRS § 708-800. The State is not required to provide a statutory definition in every charge which tracks the language of a statute that includes terms defined elsewhere in the code. State v. 
Mita, 124 Hawai
'i 385, 391-92, 245 P.3d 458, 464-65 (2010). 
"[T]he State need only allege the statutory definition of a term when it creates an additional essential element of the offense, and the term itself does not provide a person of common understanding with fair notice of that element." Id. at 392, 245 
P.3d at 465. 
Anzai was charged as follows: 
On or about the 21st day of May, 2012, in the District
of South Kohala, County and State of Hawai' i,
KANIAULONO ANZAI, with intent to defraud, concealed ortook possession of the goods or merchandise of a storeor retail establishment, that is amaretto liquorbelonging to ISLAND GOURMET MARKET, and the value ofsaid property did not exceed $100, thereby committingthe offense of Theft in the Fourth Degree(Shoplifting), in violation of Sections 708-830(8) and708-833(1), [Hawaii] Revised Statutes, as amended. 
The statutory definition of "intent to defraud," does
 
not create an additional element of the offense. The intent
 
requirement itself is an element of the offense. Similar to the
 crime charged in Mita, the definition of "intent to defraud" is
 consistent with its commonly understood meaning and sufficiently
 provided Anzai with notice of what was being charged. Id. Anzai
 
stated that he understood the charge, therefore, he cannot claim
 that he did not know the nature and cause of the accusation
 against him. Therefore, the charge was not deficient.
 
(2) Anzai claims that his counsel was not given
 
adequate time to prepare for trial "to explore the possible alibi
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and misidentification defenses, including subpoenaing witnesses,
 
as necessary," when his motion for a continuance was denied. The
 State objected to the continuance because its civilian witness
 who had to take leave from work was present.
 
On appeal, Anzai claims that counsel could have "more 
completely prepared for trial" had the continuance been granted. Anzai notes that "the district court denied Anzai's motion to continue trial at the first trial setting on January 8, 2013," and "the district court was made aware that Anzai was unable to meet with the Trial DPD prior to trial to prepare for the trial." Anzai also claims that the continuance should have been granted to give him time to give notice under Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12.1 which requires advance notice to the State of an alibi defense. Anzai claims the failure to provide a continuance precluded Anzai's alibi defense and was a court-imposed sanction. 
"A motion for continuance is addressed to the sound 
discretion of the trial court, and the court's ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of that discretion." State v. Lee, 9 Haw. App. 600, 603, 856 P.2d 1279, 
1281 (1993). "Generally, to constitute an abuse, it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. Crisostomo, 
94 Hawai
'i 282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000) (citation, internal 
quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
At trial, Anzai's counsel stated that he only met with
 
Anzai that day when he learned that Anzai was likely to assert an
 alibi defense; as no notice was given to the State, he requested
 more time to interview Anzai in person so that he could
 adequately prepare for trial. The January 8, 2015 court date was
 a trial date that was set on November 27, 2012. However, trial
 counsel did not provide any reason why he failed to confer with
 Anzai prior to trial.
 
Although Anzai claims that trial counsel could have
 
been better prepared for trial had a continuance been granted, he
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
does not claim trial counsel's conduct constituted ineffective
 
assistance of counsel.
 
HRPP Rule 12.1 requires that a defendant notify the
 
prosecutor in writing of an intention to rely upon the defense of
 alibi. HRPP Rule 12.1(a). The rule further states that "Upon
 the failure of either party to comply with the requirements of
 this rule the court may exclude the testimony of any undisclosed
 witness offered by such party as to the defendant's absence from,
 or presence at, the scene of the alleged offense." HRPP
 Rule 12.1(e). Anzai claims that he was prevented from asserting
 an alibi defense because his motion for a continuance was denied
 after his counsel requested time to serve notice upon the State
 of his intention to rely upon an alibi defense. Anzai further
 claims this constitutes a sanction by the District Court.
 
"In the context of a criminal prosecution, 'alibi'
 
denotes an attempt by the defendant to demonstrate he 'did not
 commit the crime because, at the time, he was in another place so
 far away, or in a situation preventing his doing the thing
 charged against him.'" State v. Cordeira, 68 Haw. 207, 210, 707
 
P.2d 373, 376 (1985) (quoting Azbill v. State, 19 Ariz. 499, 501,
 172 P. 658, 659 (1918)). "Strictly speaking, alibi evidence is
 merely rebuttal evidence directed to that part of the state's
 evidence which tends to identify the defendant as the person who
 committed the alleged crime." Id. (internal quotation marks
 
omitted) (quoting Witt v. State, 205 Ind. 499, 503, 185 N.E. 645,
 647 (1933)). "Though Rule 12.1 of the [HRPP] requires the
 defendant to give notice of an intention to rely upon the defense
 of alibi,[] it is not an affirmative defense. See [HRS] § 701­
115.[] And an 'alibi, if successful, is proven under the aegis
 of a general denial.'" Id. at 210-11, 707 P.2d at 376 (quoting
 
State v. Hess, 9 Ariz. App. 29, 33, 449 P.2d 46, 50 (1969)). The
 alibi defense was meant to raise doubt about the identity of the
 culprit. See State v. Lira, 70 Haw. 23, 30, 759 P.2d 869, 873-74
 
(1988) (citing Cordeira, 68 Haw. at 212, 707 P.2d at 377). In
 addition, HRPP Rule 12.1(e) also states "This rule shall not
 limit the right of the defendant to testify in the defendant's
 own behalf."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Anzai was not precluded from raising an alibi defense
 
or otherwise raising doubt as to the identify of the culprit. 
Anzai testified that he was not present at the scene on the day
 of the alleged incident. Neither did the District Court
 otherwise sanction Anzai for failing to give notice of his intent
 to rely upon an alibi defense. HRPP Rule 12.1(e). As Anzai did
 
2
not proffer any other witnesses,  the District Court did not
exclude any of Anzai's witnesses. Therefore, the District Court
 did not err by denying Anzai's motion for a continuance.
 
THEREFORE,

 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order, entered on January 9, 2013 in the District
 Court of the Third Circuit, South Kohala Division is affirmed.

 We note that in Anzai's January 18, 2013 motion for new trial,
later withdrawn, he did not argue that he had identified any potential alibi
witnesses.
