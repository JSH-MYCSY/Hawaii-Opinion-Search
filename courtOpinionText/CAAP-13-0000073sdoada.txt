IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
TODD ATHERTON PERKINS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TAMMY ASH PERKINS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 11-1-0086)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Tammy Ash Perkins (Tammy) appeals
 
from the January 10, 2013 "Order on Plaintiff's Motion for Post-
Decree Relief Filed December 7, 2012," entered in the Family
1
Court of the Second Circuit  (family court).
  
On appeal, Tammy, proceeding pro se, contends the
 
family court erred by: 
(1) finding Plaintiff-Appellee Todd Atherton Perkins
 
(Todd) had provided Tammy alternative schooling options for their
 
child before the March 2012 re-enrollment at Shining Mountain
 
Waldorf School (SMW) located in Boulder, Colorado;
 
(2)
 finding Todd had provided Tammy notice that he
 
could not afford to maintain their child's enrollment at SMW
 
before the March 2012 re-enrollment; and
 
1

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(3) finding that the September 26, 2012 Divorce Decree
 
was relevant to their child's March 2012 re-enrollment at SMW.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Tammy's appeal lacks merit.
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to 
establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai 'i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
Tammy does not substantiate her first contention with a
 
record citation to the family court's finding that Todd had
 
provided her alternative schooling options before March 2012. 
Tammy may have misinterpreted the family court's statement at the
 
December 14, 2012 hearing: "[the family court] would strongly
 
urge you [(Tammy)] to find an alternative schooling if possible." 
The family court did not find that Todd had provided alternative
 
schooling arrangements, but rather urged Tammy to do so. 
Nor does Tammy substantiate her second contention with
 
a record citation to the family court's finding that Todd had
 
provided Tammy notice that he could not afford to maintain their
 
child's enrollment at SMW before the March 2012 re-enrollment. 
Again, Tammy may have misinterpreted the family court's statement
 
at the December 14, 2012 hearing: "I also want to say that I,
 
frankly, from looking over what's gone on here and your financial
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
condition I don't see how you folks can afford to send this child
 
to private school at this point." The family court did not find
 
that Todd had provided Tammy notice that he would be unable to 
afford SMW tuition, but rather offered its own observation that
 
the parties' financial condition seemed to preclude private
 
schooling. Further, the record contains Todd's August 1, 2012
 
Income and Expense statement, reflecting a monthly deficiency of
 
$304, which the family court could have construed as notice to
 
Tammy of Todd's financial condition. 
Tammy's third contention is that the family court's
 
oral ruling on December 14, 2012 "applied a stipulation in the
 
divorce decree to an occurrence that took place six months
 
earlier." The family court's application of the divorce decree
 
to assess Todd's motion for post-decree relief itself did not
 
constitute an abuse of discretion because "a divorce decree is
 
conclusive as to the division and distribution of the real and
 
personal property of the parties even when it is silent in that
 
respect." Vaughan v. Williamson, 1 Haw. App. 496, 502, 621 P.2d
 
387, 392 (1980); see Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 580-56 (2006
 Repl.). Regarding the family court's ruling that Todd was not
 
financially liable for half of their child's SMW tuition, Tammy
 
argues:
 
[Todd] was held equally responsible for three years
prior and therefore should be held responsible for the
2012-2013 school year. To pardon [Todd] from this
responsibility by applying a stipulation in the divorce
decree, which took place, six months after her fourth year
of re-enrollment, was a terrible mistake. The outcome
 placed an unexpected [$14,145] burden on [Tammy]. 
Tammy's argument may be construed as a potential 
promissory estoppel claim. See Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawai 'i 
297, 314, 219 P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009) ("Pleadings prepared by pro 
se litigants should be interpreted liberally.") A promissory 
estoppel claim must have four elements: "(1) . . . a promise; (2) 
[t]he promisor must, at the time he or she made the promise, 
foresee that the promisee would rely upon the promise 
(foreseeability); (3) [t]he promisee does in fact rely upon the 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
promisor's promise; and (4) [e]nforcement of the promise is 
necessary to avoid injustice." Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. 
in Hawaii, Ltd., 100 Hawai 'i 149, 164-65, 58 P.3d 1196, 1211-12 
(2002) (citations omitted). For the purposes of promissory 
estoppel, a promise is "a manifestation of intention to act or 
refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a 
promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made." 
Gonsalves, 100 Hawai 'i at 165, 58 P.3d at 1212 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). "The essence of promissory estoppel is detrimental reliance on a promise." Id. 
(internal quotation marks, citation, and footnote omitted). 
Tammy's promissory estoppel claim would be that she had
 
relied on a "promise" either from the family court or from Todd
 that Todd would be responsible for paying half of their child's
 
SMW tuition when she paid the March 2012 enrollment fee. The
 
family court's September 7, 2011 "Order of the Evidentiary
 
Hearing held August 8, 2011" requiring Todd to pay for their
 
child's SMW tuition for the fall semester cannot be construed as
 
a "promise" to Tammy. Tammy specifically motioned for the family
 
court to issue an order requiring Todd to pay for their child's
 
SMW tuition going forward and the family court denied this
 
motion.
 
Tammy could not have reasonably relied upon Todd's past 
payments for their child's Haleakal
a Waldorf School tuition in 
Maui and SMW tuition in Colorado as a "promise" that he would continue to do so in March 2012. In a letter dated April 20, 
2011, Todd's counsel informed Tammy's former attorney that Todd 
"does not believe that [SMW] is necessary since he does not 
believe it is best for [their child] to be removed from the State 
of [Hawai
'i]." Accordingly, the family court appropriately found 
"there was not an agreement as to where [their child] was to attend school." The family court did not abuse its discretion by 
applying paragraph 5 of the divorce decree and determining that 
Tammy's decision to re-enroll their child in SMW was a unilateral 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
decision and that Tammy could not financially bind Todd to a
 
responsibility to pay the SMW tuition without his consent.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Family Court of the
 
Second Circuit's January 10, 2013 "Order on Plaintiff's Motion for Post-Decree Relief filed December 7, 2012" is affirmed.
