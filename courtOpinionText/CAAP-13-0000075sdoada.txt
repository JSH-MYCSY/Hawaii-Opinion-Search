 The terms "notice of pendency of action" and "lis pendens" are 
used interchangeably in Hawai' i case law. See, e.g., Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 
Hawai'i 307, 309 n.1, 141 P.3d 480, 482 n.1 (2006).

FVL raises a single point of error on appeal,

 
contending that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
 
granting the Motion to Expunge and entering the Expungement
 Order. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve FVL's point of error as follows:
 
In S. Utsunomiya Enters. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 
Haw. 480, 866 P.2d 951 (1994), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court clearly 
held that "the filing of a lis pendens must be limited in application to actions directly seeking to obtain title to or possession of real property[.]" Utsunomiya, 75 Haw. at 484, 866 
P.2d at 956. 
Acknowledging that there was some authority to the
 
contrary, the court emphasized that it "[found] more persuasive
 the authority that holds that the lis pendens statute must be
 strictly construed and that the application of lis pendens should
 be limited to actions directly seeking to obtain title to or
 possession of real property." Id. at 510, 866 P.2d at 966
 
(emphasis in original). FVL does not directly seek to obtain
 title to or possession of the subject real property. FVL's
 argument in favor of a broader interpretation of Utsunomiya's
 
3
 System is the parent company of Residential.

holding, based in part on an Arizona Court of Appeals decision,
 
is of no avail.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's February 4, 2013
 
Expungement Order is affirmed.
