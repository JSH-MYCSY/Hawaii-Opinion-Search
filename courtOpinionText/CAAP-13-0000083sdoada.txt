v.
 
SUSANNA YI, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-12-04392)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant–Appellant Susanna Yi (Yi) was charged with 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 291E–61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2012). Yi appeals from the Judgment, which dismissed her OVUII charge without prejudice, that was filed on January 16, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).
1 The only reason provided by the District 
Court for dismissing the OVUII charge was that the time limit under Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48 (2000) for 
a speedy trial was "imminent." The District Court did not provide any reason for dismissing the charge without prejudice as opposed to with prejudice. In rendering its ruling, the District Court stated: "Since [HRPP] Rule 48 is imminent, matter will be dismissed. Motion to continue [requested by the prosecution]

will be denied. Matter will be dismissed without prejudice and
 
bail to be returned." 
On appeal, Yi contends that the trial court "erred in
 
dismissing the case without prejudice without any findings of
 fact or conclusions of law to support its decision." Yi argues
 that the case "should be dismissed with prejudice," or at the
 very least, that we should remand the case to the trial court so
 that it can "wrestle with [the] analysis" of whether to dismiss
 with or without prejudice. 
The only reason provided by the District Court for
 
dismissing the charge was that "[HRPP] Rule 48 is imminent." We
 therefore conclude that in evaluating whether the District Court
 erred in dismissing the charge without prejudice instead of with
 prejudice, it is appropriate to apply the standards for
 dismissals under HRPP Rule 48.
 
In State v. Hern, Nos. CAAP–11–0000644 and 
CAAP–12–0000528, 2013 WL 1233543 (Hawai
'i App. Mar. 27, 2013), we 
held that "in determining whether to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under HRPP Rule 48(b), the trial court must not 
2
only consider the Estencion factors,  but must also clearly
articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any other
 factor it considered in rendering its decision." Hern, 2013 WL
 
1233543, at *5. In this case, the District Court did not state
 any reason for its decision to dismiss the charge without
 prejudice. We conclude that the record is inadequate to permit
 meaningful review of the District Court's exercise of discretion
 in dismissing the charge without prejudice. See Hern, 2013 WL
 
2The "Estencion factors" are: "'[(1)] the seriousness of the
offense; [(2)] the facts and the circumstances of the case which
led to the dismissal; and [(3)] the impact of a reprosecution onthe administration of [HRPP Rule 48] and on the administration ofjustice[.]'" State v. Hern, Nos. CAAP–11–0000644 and
CAAP–12–0000528, 2013 WL 1233543, at *1 (Hawai
'i App.
Mar. 27, 2013) (brackets in original) (quoting State v.Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981)).

Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's Judgment
 
dismissing the charge without prejudice, and we remand the case
 
with instructions that the District Court: (1) consider the
 Estencion factors in determining whether to dismiss Yi's OVUII
 charge with or without prejudice; and (2) make findings that
 clearly articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any
 other factor it considered in rendering its decision.
