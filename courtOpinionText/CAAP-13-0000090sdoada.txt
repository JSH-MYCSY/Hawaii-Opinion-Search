APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0050-01 PWB)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants James Bolla and Dallas M. Bolla
 
(collectively, Bolla) appeal from the January 18, 2013 Judgment
 
and the March 7, 2013 post-judgment "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion to
 
Reinstate Original Complaint, Filed January 10, 2013" entered in
the Circuit Court of First Circuit1
 (circuit court) in favor of
Defendant-Appellee University of Hawai 'i (University). 
Bolla contends the circuit court committed reversible
 
error by:

 The Honorable Patrick W. Border presided. 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1) granting summary judgment for University on Bolla's 
claims under the Hawai 'i Whistleblower Protection Act (HWPA), 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), §§ 378-61 through 378-69 (1993); 
(2) entering the March 7, 2013 "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion to
 
Reinstate Original Complaint, Filed January 10, 2013," which
 
denied Bolla's January 10, 2013 Motion to Reinstate the Original
 
Complaint and awarded attorneys' fees and costs to the
 
University; and
 
(3) granting summary judgment on alleged torts of
 
invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional
 
distress (IIED).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Bolla's appeal is without merit.
 
(1) The circuit court did not err in holding that the 
federal courts' determination that the University's non­pretextual, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating James 
Bolla's employment in the context of granting summary judgment in 
favor of the University resolved essential, identical issues to 
those in the instant case collaterally estopping Bolla from 
relitigating these issues under their HWPA claim against the 
University. Keahole Defense Coal., Inc. v. Bd. of Land & Natural 
Res., 110 Hawai
'i, 419, 429, 134 P.3d 585, 595 (2006).2 
(2) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by 
denying Bolla's motion to reinstate their original complaint. See Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Hawai
'i, Ltd., 100 Hawai 'i 
149, 158, 58 P.3d 1196, 1205 (2002) (holding that a Hawai 'i court 
has broad discretion to deny leave to amend a complaint pursuant 
to Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 15).

 As Dallas M. Bolla presents no discernable argument regarding the
circuit court's ruling on her HWPA claim, we deem any challenge thereto
waived. Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 
Hawai'i 277, 288, 172 P.3d 1021, 1032 (2007).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
awarding attorneys' fees and costs to the University in 
connection with Bolla's motion to reinstate their original 
complaint. "Sanctions in the form of attorneys' fees and costs 
may be imposed by the trial court in accordance with [HRS] 
§§ 603-21.9(1) and (6) [1993]." Enos v. Pac. Transfer & 
Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai 'i 452, 458, 903 P.2d 1273, 1279 (1995). 
(3) Bolla's points of error in regards to their false-
light invasion of privacy and IIED claims both allege work-related injuries that fall under Hawai
'i's Workers' Compensation 
Laws. HRS § 386-1 (1993 and Supp. 2012), et seq. 
Bolla's IIED claims alleged personal "work injuries" 
within the scope of HRS § 386-3 (Supp. 2012) and are therefore exclusively remedied under Hawai
'i's workers' compensation 
statutes. See HRS § 386-5 (1993). 
Hawai'i state courts have applied the HRS § 386-5 
exclusivity provisions to IIED claims, unless they arise out of sexual harassment, assault, or discrimination. Yang v. 
Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, 128 Hawai
'i 173, 183, 284 P.3d 946, 
956 (App. 2012) (concluding that exclusivity provision in HRS 
§ 386-5 barred plaintiff's intentional tort claims, including 
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress); see also 
Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai 'i 92, 109, 
176 P.3d 91, 108 (2008) ("[i]nasmuch as Kamaka has alleged a claim for emotional distress, that does not arise out of sexual 
harassment or sexual assault, such claim is, pursuant to HRS 
§ 386–5, barred"); Furukawa v. Honolulu Zoological Soc., 85 
Hawai
'i 7, 18, 936 P.2d 643, 654 (1997) ("agree[ing] . . . that 
[Hawai 'i's] workers' compensation scheme serves to bar a civil 
action for physical and emotional damages resulting from work-
related injuries and accidents[,]" but declining to apply this 
bar to plaintiffs' sex and race discrimination claims). 
The circuit court correctly granted the University's
 
motion for partial judgment on Bolla's invasion of privacy
 
claims. This court has stated that general invasion of privacy
 
claims fall within HRS § 386-5 exclusivity provisions:
 
3
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Specific exceptions [to HRS § 386-5 exclusivity provisions]
were later carved out by the [Hawai' i] Legislature: sexual
harassment or sexual assault—not harassment or assault in general; infliction of emotional distress related to sexualassault or sexual harassment—not just any infliction ofemotional distress; invasion of privacy related to sexualassault or sexual harassment—not invasion of privacygenerally. 
Yang, 128 Hawai 'i at 177, 284 P.3d at 950. 
The allegations in Bolla's amended complaint are 
sufficient to establish that HRS § 386-5 bars Bolla from 
recovering damages outside of the workers' compensation scheme. 
Yang, 128 Hawai 'i at 183, 284 P.3d at 956; see also Courtney v. 
Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 899 F.2d 845 (9th Cir. 1990) (plaintiff's claim for emotional distress arising out 
of discharge was barred by Hawai
'i workers' compensation law); 
Ellison v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 938 F. Supp. 1503 (D. Hawai
'i 1996) (exclusivity provision of Hawai 'i workers' 
compensation law barred claims against employer for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 18, 2013 Judgment
 
and the March 7, 2013 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion to Reinstate Original Complaint,
 
Filed January 10, 2013" both entered in the Circuit Court of
 
First Circuit are affirmed.
