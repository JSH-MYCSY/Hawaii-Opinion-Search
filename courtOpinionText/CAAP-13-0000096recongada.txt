IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
SHERMAN SHIH-LUNG HSIEH, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
I-TING SUN aka KATHERINE SUN, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D. NO. 11-1-2036)

 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART 
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 

AND
 
AMENDING THE OPINION OF THE COURT
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellant Sherman Shih-
Lung Hsieh's November 30, 2015 Motion for Reconsideration
 
(Motion) of this court's November 19, 2015 opinion and the record
 herein,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is granted in part
 
and denied in part and the Opinion of the Court entered on
 November 19, 2015, is amended as follows. 
(1) On page 3, footnote 2 is amended to read:
 
As explained infra, Wife appeared in this
case to assert her defenses, including lack of
subject matter jurisdiction and lack of personal
jurisdiction. The family court granted Wife's
motion for summary judgment, which asserted lack
of subject matter jurisdiction, and thus the
question of personal jurisdiction over Wife has
not been argued or addressed. In this regard, the
family court granted a motion by Husband
 authorizing him to personally serve Wife in Taiwan
pursuant to HRS ยง 580-3(b) (2006). An affidavit
 of service is filed in the record.
 
We note that Husband also raises the question
of in rem jurisdiction under Rodrigues v.
Rodrigues, 7 Haw. App. 102, 747 P.2d 1281 (1987).
However, Rodrigues addresses circumstances where a
defendant is served by publication and sets out
 specific standards that must be met to establish
in rem jurisdiction to divide property and debts
in Hawai
'i. Here, Wife was not served by
publication and the requirements set forth in
Rodrigues were not addressed below. Indeed,
Husband's Complaint requested relief beyond just
the division of property and debts in Hawai
'i, and
thus he sought to effect personal service on Wife.
Given the record in this case, the question of in
 rem jurisdiction under Rodrigues is not properly
before us. Our opinion does not preclude Husband
from seeking to establish such jurisdiction on
remand.
 
(2) On page 17, a new footnote is added as follows:
14 As previously noted, given the record in this case,
we do not reach the question of in rem jurisdiction under
Rodrigues, 7 Haw. App. 102, 747 P.2d 1281.
 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.
