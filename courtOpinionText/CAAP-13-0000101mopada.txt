OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DAVID W. SWIFT, JR. and LOIS F. SWIFT,
Plaintiffs-Appellees/Cross-Appellants,
v.
 
CATHERINE SWIFT and JAY NELSON,
Defendants-Appellants/Cross-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0567 (KTN))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellees/Cross-Appellants David W. Swift,
 
Jr. (Father) and Lois F. Swift (Mother) (collectively Parents)
 
brought this lawsuit against their daughter and son-in-law,
 
Defendants-Appellants/Cross-Appellees Catherine Swift (Daughter)
 
and Jay Nelson (Husband), alleging claims for breach of contract,
 
fraudulent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment,
 
assault and battery, negligence and breach of fiduciary
 duty/constructive trust. After a jury trial, the Circuit Court
 
1
of the First Circuit (circuit court)  entered a Second Amended
Final Judgment, filed on February 14, 2013, which entered
 judgment in favor of Parents and against Daughter and Husband for
 the sum of $462,998.50, and in favor of Mother and against

 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Daughter for the sum of $3,000. The parties appeal and cross-
appeal from the Second Amended Final Judgment.
 
On appeal, Daughter and Husband contend the circuit 
court erred: (1) in denying Daughter and Husband's Hawai 'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 50 Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL); (2) in denying Daughter and Husband's Motion for Remittitur; and (3) when it entered the Second Amended Final Judgment because it awards duplicative damages and there was not sufficient evidence to support Parents' claims and damages. 
On cross-appeal, Parents contend the circuit court
 
erred by (1) sua sponte granting JMOL that dismissed Parents'
 punitive damages claim; (2) refusing Parents' proposed jury
 instruction on punitive damages related to the fraud claim; and
 (3) not instructing the jury on punitive damages for fraud. 
For the reasons set out below, we affirm, except to the
 
extent that the issue of punitive damages as to Parents' fraud
 claim and breach of fiduciary duty claim should have reached the
 jury.
I. Background
 
This case involves two properties, one located at 420
 
Hao St. (420 Property) and another at 412 Hao St. (412 Property). 
In addition, this case involves an incident where Mother and
 Daughter had an argument that resulted in Daughter throwing a cup
 at Mother, which caused Mother's head to bleed.
 
The first issue with regard to the properties involves
 
the transfer of the deed for the 412 Property. Parents purchased
 the 412 Property in 1999 and the deed to the property originally
 indicated that Parents owned a 99% interest and Daughter owned a
 1% interest. On March 3, 2004, Parents transferred their 99%
 interest and Daughter transferred her 1% interest to Daughter and
 Husband jointly. Parents contend that the transfer of their 99%
 interest was meant to be temporary until Daughter and Husband
 refinanced the 412 Property and then Daughter and Husband were to
 transfer the interest back to Parents. Daughter and Husband
 contend that the 412 Property was a gift.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The second issue with regard to the properties involves
 
a view easement. Parents originally bought the 412 Property with
 
the intent to preserve their view of the ocean from the 420
 Property. On July 23, 2004, Parents and Daughter signed a view
 easement granting an easement to Parents over the 412 Property.
 However, the view easement was apparently incomplete because at
 that point Parents had conveyed their interest in the 412
 Property to both Daughter and Husband and Husband did not sign
 the view easement document. Later, in 2006, Husband represented
 that he would sign the document, but never did.
 
The third issue with regard to the properties involves
 
a contract. On March 2, 2006, Parents, Daughter, and Husband
 signed "Agreement by Catherine Swift and Jay Nelson to pay the
 Remaining Mortgage Balance in its entirety on the 420 Hao Street
 property, Honolulu, owned by David and Lois Swift, Beginning at
 the time of David Swift's Retirement" (2006 Agreement). The 2006
 Agreement states that Parents loaned Daughter and Husband
 approximately $250,000 of Parents' retirement and other savings
 with the understanding that Daughter and Husband would repay this
 loan at some future date. Daughter and Husband signed the 2006
 Agreement, agreeing to make monthly payments equivalent to
 Parents' mortgage payments, to begin when Father retired and
 until the mortgage on the 420 Property was in paid in full. 
In a letter dated January 9, 2011, Parents stated they
 
had not received any payments after Father's retirement on June
 1, 2010. Daughter and Husband responded in a letter dated
 January 25, 2011 and denied any financial obligation to parents
 regarding the 412 Property.
 
On March 23, 2011, Parents filed a Complaint against
 
Daughter and Husband asserting six counts: (1) Breach of
 Contract; (2) Fraudulent Misrepresentation/Fraudulent
 Concealment; (3) Unjust Enrichment/Equitable Lien; (4) Assault
 and Battery; (5) Negligence; and (6) Breach of Fiduciary
 Duty/Constructive Trust. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On December 20, 2011, the circuit court filed an order
 
granting Parents' motion for partial summary judgment finding
 
Daughter and Husband liable as a matter of law on the 2006
 Agreement.
 
The case went to trial commencing on March 19, 2012. 
On March 23, 2012, upon conclusion of Parents' case at trial,
 Daughter and Husband orally moved for JMOL regarding fraud,
 unjust enrichment, assault and battery, negligence and breach of
 fiduciary duty and punitive damages regarding assault and
 battery. The circuit court orally denied Daughter and Husband's
 Motion for JMOL.
 
On March 28, 2012, the circuit court held a hearing
 
reconsidering JMOL on the issue of punitive damages. The circuit
 court granted JMOL as to punitive damages with regard to Parents'
 causes of action based on (1) unjust enrichment; (2) assault and
 battery; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty.
 
On April 3, 2012, a Special Verdict Form was filed in
 
which the jury awarded Parents: $41,326.97 for past monthly
 payments under the 2006 Agreement; $302,000 for fraud damages;
 $5,000 in general damages for negligence associated with the cup
 incident, but apportioning fault at forty percent to Mother and
 sixty percent to Daughter; $55,000 for breach of promise with
 regard to the view easement; and $55,000 for breach of promise
 with regard to the transfer of the deed.
 
On April 11, 2012, the circuit court filed a Judgment
 
awarding Parents the sum of $453,326.97 against both Daughter and
 Husband, and $3,000 to Mother against Daughter. 
On April 16, 2012, Daughter and Husband filed a motion
 
for remittitur. On April 20, 2012, Daughter and Husband filed a
 "Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, Or, Alternatively,
 Motion for New Trial," which sought JMOL regarding the fraud
 claim, breach of fiduciary duty claim, and the damages awarded
 for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. 
On June 13, 2012, the circuit court filed an order
 
denying Daughter and Husband's motion for remittitur. On June
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
13, 2012, the circuit court also filed an "Order Denying
 
Defendants' Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, Or,
 Alternatively, Motion for New Trial."
 On June 13, 2012, the circuit court filed an Amended
 
Final Judgment which included, pursuant to a previous order, an
 award of costs in the amount of $1,406.14 and attorney's fees in
 the amount of $8,265.39 to Parents. Thus, the circuit court
 awarded $462,998.50 to Parents and against both Daughter and
 Husband, and $3,000 to Mother against Daughter. 
Daughter and Husband appealed and Parents cross-
appealed from the Amended Final Judgment, however, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the Amended Final Judgment did not specifically identify the claim or claims on which the circuit court intended to enter judgment, as required in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 
115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994). Therefore, on February 14, 2013, the circuit court entered a Second Amended Final Judgment against Daughter and Husband for the sum of $462,998.50 upon Counts One, Two, Three, and Six of the Complaint and against Daughter for the sum of $3,000 upon Counts Four and Five of the Complaint.
II. Standards of Review
 
Verdicts based on conflicting evidence will not be set aside
where there is substantial evidence to support the jury's
findings. We have defined "substantial evidence" as credible
evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value
to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
In deciding a motion for directed verdict or [judgment not
withstanding the verdict], the evidence and the inferences
which may be fairly drawn therefrom must be considered in
the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and either
motion may be granted only where there can be but one
reasonable conclusion as to the proper judgment.

'i 1, 14, 84 P.3d 509, 
522 (2004) (citation, block format and brackets omitted).
III. Daughter and Husband's Appeal
A. Breach of fiduciary duty
 
Daughter and Husband contend the circuit court erred in
 
denying their Motion for JMOL and entering the Second Amended
 
Judgment because there was not sufficient evidence to support a
 finding of breach of fiduciary duty and the claim was barred by
 the statute of limitations and the statute of frauds. 
To claim breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must 
show that a fiduciary relationship existed between the parties, the defendant breached a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, and the breach proximately caused injury to the plaintiff. See 37 C.J.S. 
Fraud § 15 (2012); Cochrane v. Azman, No. 29562, 2011 WL 661714 125 Hawai
'i 242, 257 P.3d 1219, at *5 (Haw. App. Feb. 22, 2011) 
(mem.). A fiduciary relationship exists when there is a relationship of trust and confidence. Meheula v. Hausten, 29 
Haw. 304, 314 (Haw. Terr. 1926). 
Parents' Complaint asserts that Daughter and Husband
 
breached their fiduciary duty by: persuading Parents to transfer
 their 99% interest in the 412 Property to Daughter and Husband
 and failing to transfer said interest back to Parents; and by
 refusing to grant a view easement over the 412 Property.
1. Statute of limitations
 
Daughter and Husband contend that a claim for breach of
 
fiduciary duty related to the view easement and the failure to
 transfer the 99% interest back to Parents is barred by the
 statute of limitations. 
A six-year statute of limitations applies to Parents'
 
breach of fiduciary duty claim. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
referred to as 'renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law.'").
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 657-1(4) (1993) The statute of limitations began to run when 
Parents discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, that: defendants would not transfer back the 99% interest in the 412 Property; and, respectively, defendants were refusing to grant a view easement. See Blair v. Ing, 95 Hawai
'i 247, 264, 21 P.3d 
452, 469 (2001) (applying the discovery rule in determining when the limitations period begins to run). "[T]he moment at which a statute of limitations is triggered is ordinarily a question of fact." Norris v. Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc., 102 Hawai
'i 203, 
206, 74 P.3d 26, 29 (2003); see Dunlea v. Dappen, 83 Hawai 'i 28, 
34, 924 P.2d 196, 202 (1996), abrogated on different grounds by Hac v. Univ. of Haw., 102 Hawai
'i 92, 73 P.3d 46 (2003) (stating 
"the issue of when plaintiff discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, that she or he was psychologically injured and that the injury was caused by CSA is a question of fact for the jury"). 
With regard to the deed transfer, Daughter and Husband
 
contend that Parents expected that Daughter and Husband would
 immediately reconvey the deed back to Parents after Parents
 transferred their 99% interest in the 412 Property to Daughter
 and Husband on March 3, 2004. Daughter and Husband further
 contend that when the 99% interest was not immediately
 transferred back to Parents, Parents knew or should have known
 that Daughter and Husband breached their fiduciary duty. Thus,
 they assert, the Complaint was filed outside the statute of
 limitations because it was filed on March 23, 2011, seven years
 after Parents transferred their 99% in the 412 Property.
 
The evidence in this case, however, is far from clear
 
when Parents knew or reasonably should have known that Daughter
 and Husband would not transfer back the 99% interest in the 412
 Property, especially given the family relationship and the
 ongoing nature of this matter. Perhaps the clearest evidence on
 this issue is a letter in January or February of 2006, from
 Father to Husband, in which Father contends that Husband obtained
 ownership of the 412 Property under false pretenses. The letter
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
further reflects a knowledge by Father at that point that Parents
 
had "lost 412." However, the Complaint in this case was filed
 within six years of this letter.
 
With regard to the view easement, Daughter and Husband
 
contend that the statute of limitations had run because a view
 easement, which Parents later deemed unenforceable without
 Husband's signature, was signed on July 23, 2004, thus Parents
 waited seven years to file their complaint. However, Husband
 testified that he represented to Parents in 2006 that he would
 consider signing the view easement. Thus, as of that time in
 2006 -- less than six years before the filing of the complaint -­there is evidence supporting Parents' reasonable belief that they
 would receive a fully executed view easement. 
Given the evidence and viewing it in a light most
 
favorable to Parents as non-movants, there was more than one
 reasonable conclusion as to when Parents discovered, or
 reasonably should have discovered, the breach of fiduciary duty. 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err in denying Daughter and
 Husband's motions for JMOL with regard to whether the statute of
 limitations had run on the breach of fiduciary duty claim related
 to the deed transfer and view easement. 
2. Statute of frauds
 
Daughter and Husband contend that the statute of frauds
 
defense bars Parents' claim for breach of fiduciary duty with
 regard to both the view easement and Daughter and Husband's
 failure to reconvey the 99% interest in the 412 Property back to
 Parents.
 
The statute of frauds provides in pertinent part: "No
 
action shall be brought . . . [u]pon any contract for the sale of
 lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or of any interest in or
 concerning them . . . unless the promise, contract, or agreement,
 upon which the action is brought . . . is in writing, and is
 signed by the party to be charged therewith[.]" HRS § 656-1 (4)
 (1993) (emphasis added). Thus, HRS § 656-1 requires any contract
 for the sale of lands, tenements, or of any interest in or
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concerning them be in writing. See Credit Assocs. of Maui, Ltd
 
v. Carlbom, 98 Hawai 'i 462, 467-68, 50 P.3d 431, 436-37 (App. 
2002). 
Parents, however, did not assert a contract claim with
 
regard to the view easement and the deed transfer. Rather,
 
Parents contended that Daughter and Husband breached their
 fiduciary duty to Parents, given their relationship, when they
 assured Parents they would execute the view easement and transfer
 back the 99% interest, but failed to do so thus resulting in
 Daughter and Husband benefitting from the breach by obtaining
 full ownership of the 412 Property and without a view easement
 attached. Parents sought damages resulting from Daughter and
 Husband's breach of fiduciary duties, not a contract claim, and
 thus the Statute of Frauds does not apply.
3. Confidential relationship
 
Daughter and Husband contend the circuit court erred in
 
denying their Motion for JMOL and entering the Second Amended
 Final Judgment because Parents did not present evidence of a
 confidential relationship to succeed on their breach of fiduciary
 duty claim related to both the view easement and the deed
 transfer.
 
As noted, a fiduciary relationship exists when there is
 
a relationship of trust and confidence. Meheula, 29 Haw. at 314. 
Kinship, by itself, is not sufficient to establish a
confidential relationship. Indeed, relatives are often
hostile to, or deal at arms' length with each other.
However, when parties are closely related, the imposition of
great trust and the letting down of all guards is natural,
and the relationship, coupled with evidence as to
intrusting, the status of the parties as to health, age,
education and dominance, may lead a court to find that a
confidential relationship existed.
 
Kam Oi Lee v. Fong Wong, 57 Haw. 137, 140, 552 P.2d 635, 638
 
(1976) (citations omitted).
 
In this case, Mother testified that Parents put
 
Daughter on the deed originally "believing and trusting that she
 would be forthcoming, and she was not . . . . [W]hen [Husband]
 and [Daughter] were married and [Husband] took over a great deal
 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the communication, we also were trusting that his
 
representations were true, and . . . they were not." Mother also
 testified that she felt she was tricked out of her 99% interest
 in the 412 Property and the view easement. Further, it is
 undisputed that Daughter signed a view easement and Husband later
 represented he would consider signing a view easement, but a view
 easement was never fully executed.
 
Given Mother's testimony and the evidence presented to
 
the jury, more than one reasonable conclusion could be reached
 with regard to whether a confidential relationship existed. 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err when it denied Daughter
 and Husband's motion for JMOL regarding breach of fiduciary duty. 
Further, substantial evidence supports a verdict in favor of
 Parents for breach of fiduciary duty.
B. Fraud
 
Daughter and Husband contend the circuit court erred in
 
denying their Motion for JMOL and entering the Second Amended
 Final Judgment because Parents did not present clear and
 convincing evidence as to all the elements of fraud. 
The elements of fraud include: "(1) false
 
representations were made by defendants, (2) with knowledge of
 their falsity (or without knowledge of their truth or falsity),
 (3) in contemplation of plaintiff's reliance upon these false
 representations, and (4) plaintiff did rely upon them." 
Hawaii's
 
Thousand Friends v. Anderson, 70 Haw. 276, 286, 768 P.2d 1293,
 1301 (1989). "[A] promise made without the present intent to
 fulfill the promise is actionable as fraud." E. Star, Inc., S.A.
 
v. Union Bldg. Materials Corp., 6 Haw. App. 125, 140, 712 P.2d
 1148, 1159 (1985). 
Parents' Complaint 
limits the claim for fraud to the
 
actions of Daughter and Husband regarding the 2006 Agreement. 
The 2006 Agreement required Daughter and Husband to begin making
 mortgage payments on the 420 Property upon Father's retirement to
 repay the $250,000 that Daughter and Husband owed Parents. 
Daughter and Husband did not begin making payments the month
 
10
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
after Father retired on June 1, 2010, as called for under the
 
2006 Agreement. On January 9, 2011, Parents sent Daughter and
 Husband a letter requesting payments under the 2006 Agreement. 
On January 25, 2011, in response to Parents' letter requesting
 that Daughter and Husband begin making payments, Daughter and
 Husband sent a letter to Parents denying that Parents loaned
 Daughter and Husband $250,000 and disagreeing that they owed
 Parents retroactive mortgage payments prior to Parents' January
 9, 2011 letter. Further, when asked at trial if she intended to
 repay Parents for the monies that Parents had invested in the 412
 Property, Daughter responded, "It was a gift." When asked
 whether she intended to pay Parents back after signing the 2006
 Agreement, Daughter testified: "We agreed in that agreement that
 if my parents were having difficulty paying their mortgage that
 they had in 2006, that we would do everything that we could to
 help them meet their mortgage payments, because we didn't want
 them to be worried that they would lose their house." 
The statements made by Daughter and Husband in their
 
January 25, 2011 letter and Daughter's testimony at trial could
 lead a jury to believe Daughter and Husband never intended to
 fulfill the 2006 Agreement. Therefore, the circuit court did not
 
err when it denied Daughter and Husband's Motion for JMOL with
 
regard to fraud. Further, substantial evidence supports a
 verdict in favor of Parents for fraud.
 
C.	 Damages awarded for breach of fiduciary duty and
fraud
 
Daughter and Husband contend the jury improperly
 
awarded damages for breach of fiduciary duty amounting to $55,000
 
for the view easement and another $55,000 for the deed transfer. 
Daughter and Husband also contend there was insufficient evidence
 to award Parents $302,000 for fraud, and that the damages awarded
 for fraud and breach of the 2006 Agreement constitute an
 impermissible double recovery.
 
It is a "well-settled principle in this jurisdiction
 
that the proper amount of damages to be awarded...is within the
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
exclusive province of the jury, since jurors are the sole judges
 
of all disputed questions of fact." Kato v. Funari, 118 Hawai 'i 
375, 381, 191 P.3d 1052, 1058 (2008) (citation, quotation marks
 and brackets omitted, ellipses in original). Further, 
a finding of an amount of damages is so much within the
exclusive province of the jury that it will not be disturbed
on appellate review unless palpably not supported by the
evidence, or so excessive and outrageous when considered
with the circumstances of the case as to demonstrate that
 the jury in assessing damages acted against rules of law or
suffered their passions or prejudices to mislead them.
 
Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai 'i 408, 436, 
32 P.3d 52, 80 (2001) (citation and block format omitted). 
With regard to breach of fiduciary duty, Mother
 
testified that Parents were asking for $200,000 in damages for
 
the breach of fiduciary duty claim. Mother testified that
 Parents requested damages because of the ongoing problems with
 Daughter and Husband and because they have not gotten the issue
 of the view easement handled, when ensuring that the view from
 the 420 Property (where Parents resided) was not blocked by
 anything on the 412 Property next door was the reason Parents
 bought the 412 Property in the first place. In addition, Mother
 testified that the damages were to compensate Parents for
 trusting Daughter and Husband to reconvey the 99% interest in the
 property. 
With regard to fraud, it does not appear that Mother or
 
Father testified to a specific amount that they were requesting
 for fraud damages. Father testified that Parents paid $302,000
 for the 412 Property and improvements made to the property. 
Mother testified that Parents put $70,000 as a down payment and
 took out a mortgage for $210,000 on the 412 Property and then
 liquidated both Parents' retirement accounts to pay for the
 additional costs of improvements to the 412 Property, which
 totaled around $302,000. Mother also testified that Husband
 talked Parents into reducing the amount of pay back in the 2006
 Agreement to $250,000. Finally, Mother also testified that
 Parents wanted the equity for the 412 Property back.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Given the testimony from Parents, we cannot conclude
 
that the damages awarded for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud
 
were palpably not supported by the evidence or so excessive and
 outrageous when considered with the circumstances. Further,
 neither the jury instructions nor the Special Verdict Form
 instructed the jury that the damages from the 2006 Agreement and
 the damages from fraud should be considered together and Daughter
 and Husband do not challenge the jury instructions or the wording
 on the Special Verdict Form on appeal. Given the unchallenged
 format of the Special Verdict Form, the fraud damages and the
 damages for the 2006 Agreement do not constitute a double
 recovery. 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err when it
 
entered the Second Amended Final Judgment with regard to damages
 awarded for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and the circuit
 court did not err in denying Daughter and Husband's motion for
 remittitur.
 
II. Parent's Cross-Appeal
A. JMOL for punitive damages
 
Parents contend that the circuit court erred when it
 
sua sponte granted JMOL as to punitive damages when Daughter and
 
Husband did not address punitive damages in their oral motion for
 JMOL. While Daughter and Husband did not specifically address
 punitive damages in their oral motion for JMOL regarding the
 unjust enrichment and the breach of fiduciary duty claims,
 Daughter and Husband did raise the issue of punitive damages with
 regard to the assault and battery.
 
Nonetheless, Parents waived their argument that it was 
error to sua sponte grant JMOL for punitive damages because Parents did not object to the circuit court's ruling sua sponte. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal 
issues not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal.") 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
B.	 Punitive damages for unjust enrichment, assault
and battery, and breach of fiduciary duty
 
Parents contend that the circuit court erred when it
 
granted JMOL for punitive damages associated with unjust
 
enrichment, assault and battery, and breach of fiduciary duty. 
We note initially that the claims for unjust enrichment and
 assault and battery were not included on the Special Verdict Form
 and Parents do not challenge this fact.
 
Punitive damages are "assessed in addition to
 
compensatory damages for the purpose of punishing the defendant
 for aggravated or outrageous misconduct and to deter the
 defendant and others from similar conduct in the future." Masaki
 
v. Gen. Motors Corp., 71 Haw. 1, 6, 780 P.2d 566, 570 (1989). 
For an award of punitive damages, 
[t]he plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant has acted wantonly or oppressively or
with such malice as implies a spirit of mischief or criminal
indifference to civil obligations, or where there has been
some wilful misconduct or that entire want of care which
 would raise the presumption of a conscious indifference to
consequences.
 
Id. at 16-17, 780 P.2d at 575 (emphasis added). "Thus, punitive
 
damages are not awarded for mere inadvertence, mistake, or errors
 of judgment." Id. at 7, 780 P.2d at 571.
 
Given that the unjust enrichment and assault/battery
 
claims were not included on the Special Verdict Form, and Parents
 do not contend on appeal that these claims should have been
 submitted to the jury, we can see no error in regard to the
 granting of JMOL for punitive damages arising from those claims. 
With regard to breach of fiduciary duty, Parents based
 
their claim on unfulfilled assurances made by Daughter and
 Husband to grant a view easement over the 412 Property as well as
 a failure to reconvey the 99% interest in the 412 Property back
 to Parents. Regarding the view easement, Husband testified that
 in 2003 he told Parents that he would consider a view easement if
 there was a clause in the easement that it would terminate upon
 Parents' death. In 2004, although the view easement included a
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clause stating "[t]his easement will last until both [Parents]
 
have died," only Daughter and Parents signed the document and
 Husband did not. Husband also testified that in 2006 he told
 Parents that he would consider adding his signature to the view
 easement, but never did. Husband testified that he did not sign
 the view easement in 2006 because he never had a copy of it and
 he also realized that Daughter did not want him to sign it. 
Given the evidence related to the view easement, a jury
 
could conclude that Daughter and Husband's conduct rose to the
 level of oppressiveness sufficient to support an award of
 punitive damages.
 
Further, regarding the 99% interest in the 412
 
Property, Parents contend that the transfer to Daughter and
 Husband was meant to be temporary. In 2006, Father wrote Husband
 a letter stating that Daughter and Husband obtained ownership to
 the 412 Property "under false pretenses." The letter also stated
 that it was Parents understanding "that title transfer would be
 TEMPORARY, to qualify for improved mortgage rates, and would be
 almost instantly returned to us."
 
By contrast, both Husband and Daughter testified that
 
the 412 Property was a gift. In addition, Daughter testified:
 "[w]e did not trick my parents into signing that deed. They were
 fully aware that they were signing a deed. And they never asked
 for it back, even though we saw them on a daily basis." 
Given the evidence in this case, a jury could conclude
 
that Daughter and Husband acted wantonly or oppressively and
 acted with a conscious indifference to their actions when they
 did not reconvey the 99% interest in the 412 Property back to
 Parents.
 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err in granting
 
JMOL for punitive damages associated with unjust enrichment and
 assault and battery, but should not have granted JMOL for
 punitive damages related to Parents' claim for breach of
 fiduciary duty.

C.	 Jury instructions regarding punitive damages for
fraud.
 
Parents contend the circuit court erred in refusing
 
Parents' proposed jury instructions for punitive damages and then
 
refusing to submit the question of punitive damages for fraud to
 the jury.
 
"The standard of review for a trial court's issuance or 
refusal of a jury instruction is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading." Moyle v. 
Y & Y Hyup Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai
'i 385, 391, 191 P.3d 1062, 1068 
(2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted). 
In this case, the circuit court had granted summary
 
judgment with regard to punitive damages associated with breach
 of contract. After Parents' case-in-chief at trial, the circuit
 court also granted JMOL as to punitive damages associated with
 unjust enrichment, assault and battery, and breach of fiduciary
 duty, leaving punitive damages associated with fraud undecided. 
Subsequently, at the end of trial, the circuit court refused,
 over objection, Parents proposed jury instructions 8.12-8.17,
 which generally addressed punitive damages. Parents objected as
 follows:
 
Punitive damages are properly pleaded in this case. We
believe the grounds for punitive damages have been proved
rather overwhelmingly in regards to those causes of action
where punitive damages were sought. We believe that some of
the case that's gone to the jury are truncated because this
Court has decided that punitive damages are not an issue.
For example, the cup incident. And in the fraud or in
the 2006 agreement in particular, punitive damages would
seem to follow that light and we therefore object to this
Court I guess granting a Rule 50 motion taking punitive
damages out of this case.
 
On April 3, 2012, following the circuit court's reading of the
 
completed Special Verdict Form, Parents requested that the court
 present the jury with one additional question regarding punitive
 damages for fraud. The circuit court denied the request.
 
In Kang v. Harrington, 59 Haw. 652, 587 P.2d 285
 
(1978), the court held that the fraudulent conduct in that case
 
16
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
warranted punitive damages. In Kang, a renter, unbeknownst to
 
the landlord, added a perpetual renewal option to the rental
 lease, instead of the one year renewal option they had previously
 agreed to. Id. at 659, 587 P.2d at 290. The supreme court found
 
that the renter "embarked upon a fraudulent scheme designed to
 acquire a long-term right to appellee's property." Id. at 662,
 
587 P.2d at 292. Furthermore, the renter intentionally made
 misstatements in the rental agreement and intentionally inserted
 the perpetual renewal option. Id. He also rushed the landlord
 
into signing the document, made improvements to the property
 without the landlord's approval, and fraudulently acquired
 approval of other improvements that he did not make. Id. 
Therefore, the court held that the renter's fraudulent conduct
 rose "to the level of oppressiveness, wantonness and malice
 sufficient to support an award of punitive damages." Id.
 
In this case, Parents presented evidence by way of the
 
2006 Agreement that, as repayment for $250,000 loaned to Daughter
 and Husband related to the 412 Property, Daughter and Husband
 agreed to make mortgage payments for Parents' 420 Property upon
 Father's retirement.
3 Parents also presented evidence that
 
Daughter and Husband never made payments, although they knew that
 Father had retired, and the January 25, 2011 letter by Daughter
 and Husband appears to disavow their obligations directly in
 contradiction to the 2006 Agreement that they signed. Moreover,
 Daughter and Husband testified that although they signed the 2006
 Agreement, they maintained their belief that the 412 Property was
 a gift. Given the evidence related to the 2006 Agreement, there
 is evidence that could lead a jury to find that Daughter and
 Husband's fraudulent conduct rose to the level of oppressiveness
 sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.
 
Therefore, the circuit court erred when it did not
 
instruct the jury regarding punitive damages associated with the

 As previously noted, Parents' fraud claim was based on Daughter and
Husband's conduct related to the 2006 Agreement.
 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fraud claim. This issue should have been included among the
 
questions presented to the jury. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Second Amended Final
 
Judgment, filed on February 14, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed, except to the extent that the issue of
 punitive damages related to Parents' fraud claim and breach of
 fiduciary duty claim should have reached the jury for
 consideration. Therefore, the case is remanded to the circuit
 court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
