Appellants), through Appellant Legg, pro se, which the court will 
construe as a motion to dismiss the appeal, the papers in support, and the record and files herein, it appears that 
(1) On February 20, 2013, Appellants filed a notice of
 
appeal from the judgment and writ of possession filed by the

 (4) On May 1, 2013, Appellant Legg signed and filed the
 
instant motion, purportedly on behalf of all Appellants;
 
(5) Under Hawai

605-14 (2012 Supp.), persons not licensed to practice law in Hawai
'i “are not permitted to act as ‘attorneys’ and represent

(10) Appellants Watts and Thompson have not filed a 
valid notice of appeal, and the time to do so has expired. See 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1); and 
(11) Absent a valid notice of appeal by Appellants
 
Watts and Thompson, we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 
Appellants Watts’ and Thompson’s appeal. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to dismiss the
 
appeal is granted in part as to Appellant Charles Legg III, and
 the appeal is dismissed as to Appellant Charles Legg III,
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(b). The motion to dismiss the appeal is
 denied as to Appellants Dolores C. Watts and Blossom P. Thompson.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed as
 
to Appellants Dolores C. Watts and Blossom P. Thompson for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
