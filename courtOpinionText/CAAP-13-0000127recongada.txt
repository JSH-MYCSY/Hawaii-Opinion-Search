ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR
 
RECONSIDERATION OR CLARIFICATION OF ORDER DENYING FEES AND COSTS
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the "Motion for Reconsideration
 
or Clarification of Order Denying Fees and Costs (Jan. 6, 2014)
 
(Dkt 75)" by Plaintiff-Appellee Oahu Publications, Inc., doing
 business as Honolulu Star-Advertiser (Plaintiff-Appellee), filed
 on January 15, 2014, the attachments thereto, and the files
 herein, the motion is granted in part and denied in part. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
By an order dated January 6, 2014 (Order), this court
 
denied Plaintiff-Appellee's requested attorney's fees and costs
 
related to CAAP-12-0000625 with prejudice and denied requested
 attorney's fees and costs related to CAAP-13-0000127 without
 prejudice. This court allowed Plaintiff-Appellee to file an
 amended request for attorney’s fees and costs within ten days
 from the date of that Order.
 
1. Plaintiff-Appellee moves this court to reconsider
 
its denial with prejudice of attorney's fees and costs related to
 CAAP-12-0000625 or, in the alternative, to provide an explanation
 for the denial of attorney's fees and costs. 
We grant Plaintiff-Appellee's request for an 
explanation for that part of the Order. Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 39(a) provides, in pertinent part, "if an appeal or petition is dismissed, costs shall be taxed against the appellant or petitioner upon proper application unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the appellate court." (Emphasis supplied) HRAP Rule 39(d)(2) states, 
A request for fees and costs or necessary expenses must be
filed with the appellate clerk, with proof of service not
later than 14 days after the time for filing a motion for
reconsideration has expired or the motion for
reconsideration has been decided. An untimely request for
fees and costs or necessary expenses may be denied.
 
In our Order, we denied Plaintiff-Appellee's request for fees and
 
costs for CAAP-12-0000625 because it was untimely.
 
2. Plaintiff-Appellee also moves this court to
 
reconsider its denial without prejudice of attorney’s fees and
 costs related to CAAP-13-0000127. This portion of Plaintiff­Appellee's motion is denied.

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 92F-15(d) provides for 
assessing "expenses reasonably incurred in the litigation." The 
information submitted was not sufficient to determine reasonableness of the requested expenses. Plaintiff-Appellee's request and the supporting declaration of counsel relied on "Exhibit 2" for detailing the requested costs. However, Exhibit 2 appears to contain information as to costs which is inconsistent with counsel's declaration and the costs request. Thus, the photocopying and extra postage charges were properly denied without prejudice. See Tortorello v. Tortorello, 113 
Hawai
'i 432, 444-45, 153 P.3d 1117, 1129-30 (2007) (requiring 
"receipt or proof of the amount being charged" or "any documentation for this court to conclude that the requested amounts . . . were reasonably and necessarily incurred in the appeal . . . ."). The information referenced in the court's prior order as to costs would assist the court in determining reasonableness of the requested costs. 
HRAP Rule 39(d)(1) states Requests for non-indigent
 
attorney's fees and costs allowed by statute or contract shall be
 submitted in a form that substantially complies with Form 8. The
 purpose of Form 8 is to apprise the court of the type or general
 nature of the work performed. It provides categories of work
 that is most common on appeal, (1) Correspondence, Interviews,
 and Conference, (2) Obtaining & Reviewing Records, (3) Legal
 Research, (4) Drafting, and (5) Other. Plaintiff-Appellee's
 first request for attorney's fees failed to categorize its work
 into any of the categories. Thus, it was not in substantial

compliance with Form 8 and the information submitted was not
 
sufficient for this court to determine that the requested fees
 were reasonable.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff-Appellee's
 
alternative relief as to CAAP-12-0000625 is granted as stated in
 this order. All other requested relief is denied.
