(By:

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Enforce Original Settlement, or, in the Alternative, for Relief
 
from Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Entered
 August 22, 2001,' Filed on December 9, 2010, as it Pertains to
 Howard K. Leslie, Sr., and (2) Denying 'Howard K. Leslie, Jr.'s
 Renewed Motion to Enforce Original Settlement of, in the
 Alternative, for Relief from Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 Law, and Order Entered August 22, 2001,' Filed on November 26,
 2012" (Order Denying the Renewed Motion to Enforce).
 
Leslie Jr. raises three points of error on appeal,
 
contending:
 
(1) The Circuit Court erred in its Order Granting 
Motion to Set Aside because it did not determine that Plaintiff-Appellee Howard K. Leslie, Sr. (Leslie Sr.) filed his Motion to 
Set Aside within a reasonable time as required by Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b); 
(2) The Circuit Court erred in its Order Granting
 
Motion to Set Aside because it did not determine whether Leslie
 
Sr.'s failure to oppose the Motion to Enforce was the result of
 inexcusable neglect or a willful act; and
 
(3) The Circuit Court erred in entering the Order
 
Denying the Renewed Motion to Enforce.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Leslie Jr.'s points of error as follows:
 
(1 & 2) Leslie Sr. brought his Motion to Set Aside
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(1).
2 A motion under this subsection
 
must be brought within a reasonable time, but in any case, no
 later than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was
 entered. HRCP Rule 60(b). The Motion to Set Aside was filed on
 February 13, 2012, less than a year (roughly five days short of a
 year) after the entry of the February 18, 2011 Order Granting
 
2
 Although Leslie Sr.'s Motion to Set Aside cited HRCP Rule 60(b)(2)
and (3) as well, the only argument presented was that the failure to oppose
the Motion to Enforce was due to the inadvertence and mistake of Leslie Sr.'s
 counsel.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Leslie Jr.'s Motion to Enforce and nearly nine months after the
 
May 18, 2011 HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment was entered against Leslie
 Sr.
 
Rule 60(b)(1) permits a court to relieve a party from a
 
final judgment or order because of mistake, inadvertence,
 surprise, or excusable neglect. "A party cannot have relief
 under 60(b)(1) merely because he is unhappy with the judgment. 
Instead he must make some showing of why he was justified in
 failing to avoid mistake or inadvertence. Gross carelessness is
 not enough." Joaquin v. Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. 435, 443, 698 P.2d
 
298, 304 (1985) (quoting 11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.
 Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, ยง 2858 (1st ed. 1973))
 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Here, Leslie Sr. merely argues that the failure to
 
respond to the Motion to Enforce was due to the inadvertence and
 mistake of his counsel. During the hearing on the Motion to Set
 Aside, his counsel elaborated, stating that:
 
What happened was this case had been pending for about 10
years, and there are lots of collateral matters that didn't
really involve my client directly and so we weren't
calendaring everything that came up. We would take a look
 at the pleadings, send it off to the client, and discuss it
with the client and then decide what to do.
 
What happened in this particular case is it came in
right before I was going on vacation. I sent it off to the
 client, went on vacation, came back. My secretary had not
calendared it. I had forgotten completely all about it.
And a few days after the hearing, my client called up and
said what happened? And I said what happened when? And I
 completely spaced out that there was a hearing or there was
a motion, and I didn't even recognize the significance of it
until afterwards.
 
This court has recognized that "[t]he weight of authority has not
 
recognized ignorance of the law or carelessness of counsel to be
 excusable neglect justifying the invocation of relief under HRCP
 Rule 60(b)(1)." Isemoto Contracting Co., Ltd. v. Andrade, 1 Haw.
 
App. 202, 205, 616 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1980). The conduct of Leslie
 Sr.'s counsel appears to be the result of mere carelessness,
 which he did not seek to remedy until nearly a full year after
 the subject order was entered. We conclude that Leslie Sr.'s
 failure to oppose the Motion to Enforce was inexcusable neglect
 which did not warrant relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1). Joaquin,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
5 Haw. App. at 443, 698 P.2d at 304. Accordingly, we must
 
further conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion
 when it entered the Order Granting Motion to Set Aside.
 
(3) In light of our conclusion that the Circuit Court
 
erred in setting aside the February 18, 2011 order and May 18,
 2011 judgment, Leslie Jr.'s Renewed Motion to Enforce was moot
 and we need not reach the substance of Leslie Jr.'s final point
 of error. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 27, 2012
 
Order Granting Motion to Set Aside is reversed and the Circuit
 Court's February 1, 2013 Order Denying the Renewed Motion to
 Enforce is vacated because it is moot.
