In February 2009, Plaintiff-Appellant Wells Fargo Bank,
 
N.S. as Trustee for Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-4 Asset-
Backed Certificates, Series 2007-4 ("Wells Fargo") foreclosed via
 a nonjudicial foreclosure sale on its mortgage lien against the
 subject property, located at 1777 Ala Moana Boulevard, Unit 1731,
 Honolulu, Hawaii 96815 (the "Property"). On March 30, 2009, a
 Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed in favor of Wells Fargo and related to
 the Property was recorded in the Office of the Assistant
 Registrar of the Land Court of the State of Hawai
'i ("Land 
Court").

In 2010, Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee
 
Association of Apartment Owners of Ilikai Apartment Building
 
("AOAO") foreclosed via a non-judicial foreclosure sale on the
 Property to recover outstanding AOAO dues owed by Wells Fargo. 
Defendant/Cross-Claimant/Appellee Daniel Tsukasa Omiya ("Omiya")
 was the successful high bidder at $15,000. The AOAO executed a
 Quitclaim Deed to Omiya, who recorded the deed in Land Court on
 September 15, 2010. The Land Court stamp appears on the

On November 3, 2010, Wells Fargo filed a Complaint
 
against Omiya and the AOAO alleging that the AOAO gave defective
 notice of the power of sale foreclosure for the Property and that
 there were "no power of sale rights granted to [the AOAO] for it
 to have exercised." Accordingly, Wells Fargo argued, "the
 subsequent sale of the Property to [] Omiya was not conducted in
 accordance with applicable Hawaii law." The Complaint did not
 allege that Wells Fargo was current on its AOAO payments, or that
 it was making AOAO payments at all. Omiya filed a cross-claim
 against the AOAO and subsequently moved for summary judgment
 against Wells Fargo.

("Amended Final Judgment"). Wells Fargo appeals from each of the
 
two orders and the amended judgment. 
On appeal, Wells Fargo contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in: (1) granting summary judgment in favor of Omiya despite evidence that Wells Fargo was current to the AOAO on its condominium fees at the time of the underlying foreclosure; (2) concluding that because a certificate number had been issued to Omiya, the case of Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 
110 P.3d 1042 (2005) prevented Wells Fargo from challenging the 
2/
AOAO's foreclosure of the subject property;  (3) granting
summary judgment in favor of Omiya despite evidence that the sale
 price of the subject property was so low that it shocked the

 
conscience. 
We affirm.
 
I. BACKGROUND

 
Based on the allegations in the Complaint, Omiya sought
 
discovery from Wells Fargo on the issue of notice provided by The
 AOAO and received by Wells Fargo, but Wells Fargo was either
 unresponsive or objected to Omiya's questions. Omiya filed a
 Motion to Compel Discovery, which the Circuit Court granted
 ("Discovery Order"). Wells Fargo did not comply with the
 Discovery Order and failed to produce documents or answer the
 interrogatories. 
Omiya filed a notice of taking deposition upon oral
 
examination pursuant to HRCP Rule 30(b)(6), which requested that
 Wells Fargo provide a representative to testify to, among other
 things, its "mail distribution policies in June 2010[.]" Omiya
 agreed twice to reschedule the HRCP Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, but
 refused Wells Fargo's third request to reschedule. On
 
2/
 Wells Fargo did not argue on summary judgment below and does not
argue on appeal that the Circuit Court erred in failing to conclude that The
AOAO held no power of sale rights, or that the absence of such rights trumpany subsequent issuance by the Land Court of a transfer certificate of titleto Omiya. Furthermore, Wells Fargo does not appear to have raised thearguments in opposition to Omiya's motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we
do not address those issues. See Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 134
Hawai'i 342, 350, 341 P.3d 548, 556 (2014) (quoting Ass'n of Apartment Owners 
of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai' i 97, 108, 58 P.3d 608, 619
(2002) ("When reviewing a summary judgment, an appellate court's consideration
of the record is limited to those materials that were considered by the trialcourt in ruling on the motion.")).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
October 13, 2011, the day before the latest rescheduled
 
deposition, Wells Fargo sent an email to Omiya, noting that
 counsel had been directed by her client to stipulate to its
 "receipt of notice of the [AOAO's] subject foreclosure sale[,]"
 expressed the expectation that this stipulation obviated the need
 to continue with the deposition, and reiterated that no
 representative would be appearing for the deposition. Omiya
 replied, noting that Wells Fargo's stipulation did not obviate
 the need for the deposition and, "[g]iven that no one will be
 appearing at the noticed deposition, we will take appropriate
 court action." On October 28, 2011, the Circuit Court entered an
 order approving the substitution of new counsel for Wells Fargo. 
On December 21, 2011, Omiya filed his motion for
 
summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that Wells Fargo
 could no longer contend that the AOAO's notice was defective in
 light of its stipulation to receipt of the notice. Wells Fargo
 opposed the motion, and alleged for the first time that
 "Plaintiff was paying the maintenance fees for the subject
 property. Therefore, [the AOAO's] foreclosure of the subject
 property is invalid as a matter of law." On January 18, 2012,
 Wells Fargo filed a non-hearing motion for leave to file a first
 amended complaint, to which Wells Fargo attached a proposed first
 amended complaint that alleged that Wells Fargo "paid all
 maintenance fees and other charges owed to [the AOAO] for the
 subject property[,]" and that "[the AOAO's] statements that
 [Wells Fargo] had failed to make payments [were] false." 
On January 19, 2012, the Circuit Court held a hearing
 
on Omiya's motion for summary judgment. The court explained that
 it would not consider Wells Fargo's pending motion for leave to
 amend the complaint, saying "I'm not going to allow you to amend
 it for the purposes of this motion here today, because that's not
 even before the Court. I think you filed it as an ex parte
 nonhearing motion." Wells Fargo argued that Omiya's title for
 the Property has not been filed with the Land Court and Omiya had
 not produced a hard copy of the transfer certificate of title
 ("TCT") confirming ownership, but the Circuit Court noted that
 Wells Fargo had admitted in its Complaint that Omiya filed with
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Land Court and had been issued a TCT. The Circuit Court
 
also noted Wells Fargo's stipulation that it had received notice
 of the foreclosure sale, stating that "the dispositive issue to
 the Court is protection of an innocent buyer and if land court
 title has been issued." The court then continued the hearing for
 the limited purpose of addressing "land court issuance of the
 actual hard copy [of TCTs]." 
On January 23, 2012, Wells Fargo filed a second non-
hearing motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. In
 addition to the changes in the earlier version of the proposed
 first amended complaint, the newly-proposed first amended
 complaint removed the judicial admissions that Wells Fargo's
 Quitclaim Deed "resulted in the issuance of Transfer Certificate
 of Title No. 940,974 in the name of [Wells Fargo]" and that
 Omiya's Quitclaim Deed "resulted in the issuance of Transfer
 Certificate of Title No. 996,234 registering title in the name of
 Defendant Omiya." 
On March 5, 2012, Omiya filed a supplemental
 
declaration of Sandra Furukawa in support of his motion for
 summary judgment ("Furukawa Declaration"). Furukawa was a former
 Registrar of the Bureau of Conveyances and the Assistant
 Registrar of the Land Court before serving as the Special
 Projects Coordinator for Title Guaranty of Hawaii, Inc., where
 she served as the primary liaison between Title Guaranty and the
 Bureau of Conveyances and Land Court. In her declaration,
 Furukawa explained that "[t]he Office of the Assistant Registrar
 of the Land Court is now nearly four years behind in physically
 producing and certifying new [TCTs] for properties registered in
 the Land Court system. This backlog is common knowledge among
 those involved in the title industry." Furukawa further explained
 that "[t]he Bureau of Conveyances is also currently over three
 months behind in updating its Grantor/grantee index that is
 available to the general public to use to search for documents
 affecting title to properties in both the Regular System and Land
 Court System. . . . [T]here is currently an over three month
 'gap' in the indexed information available to the general public
 to use to search for documents affecting titles to properties."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 21, 2012, the Circuit Court held its continued 
hearing to address the Land Court certificate issue. The Circuit 
Court determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact that the issuance of a new TCT number was sufficient to provide the conclusive effect of a physical certificate of title on the question of title to land as provided by Aames, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 110 P.3d 1042, and Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") 
Chapter 501, and granted summary judgment in favor of Omiya. 
On June 20, 2012, the Circuit Court denied Wells
 
Fargo's second non-hearing motion for leave to file a first
 amended complaint, but on June 25, 2010, granted Wells Fargo's
 first non-hearing motion for leave to file a first amended
 complaint. On July 6, 2012, Wells Fargo filed its First Amended
 Complaint.
 
On February 5, 2013, the Circuit Court issued the
 
Amended Final Judgment in favor of Omiya. Wells Fargo timely
 appealed from the Amended Final Judgment to this court on
 March 5, 2013.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Summary Judgment
 
This court reviews the Circuit Court's grant of Omiya's
 
motion for summary judgment de novo. Querubin v. Thronas, 107
 
Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (citing Hawai 'i Cnty. 
Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai 'i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 
(2000)). 
With regard to the type of evidence that courts may
 
consider in ruling on a summary judgment motion, we have
 
explained that:
 
A motion for summary judgment may be decided "only on the
basis of admissible evidence."  Takaki v. Allied Mach. Corp.,
87 Hawai' i 57, 69,  951  P.2d 507, 519 (1998).  "To be 
admissible, documents must be authenticated by and attached toan affidavit that meets the requirements of [HRCP Rule 56(e)]and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits
could be admitted into evidence." Id . (internal quotation
marks and brackets omitted)(quoting 10 A C. Wright, A. Miller& M. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil § 2722, at

III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 Wells Fargo's evidence that it was current in its
obligation to the AOAO was correctly ignored by the
Circuit Court in evaluating Omiya's motion for summary
judgment.
 
Wells Fargo contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
granting summary judgment because Wells Fargo had presented
 
evidence that it was current on the amounts due and owing to the
 AOAO on the Property. This argument is without merit.
 
The Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure require that "[a] 
pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, . . . shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]" Haw. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated that "Hawaii's rules of notice 
pleading require that a complaint set forth a short and plain statement of the claim that provides defendant with fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests." In re Genesys Data Tech., Inc., 95 Hawai
'i 33, 41, 
18 P.3d 895, 903 (2001) (citing Haw. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (1999); Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 220, 626 P.2d 173, 181 (1981)). Further, Hawai
'i appellate courts have previously cited favorably to 
federal cases holding that "[a] motion for leave to amend is not a vehicle to circumvent summary judgment" and "[i]t is generally inappropriate to grant leave to amend a complaint while summary judgment is pending." Tokuhisa v. Cutter Mgmt. Co., 122 Hawai
'i 
181, 193, 223 P.3d 246, 258 (App. 2009) (quoting Fed. Home Loan Mort. Corp. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 89 Hawai
'i 157, 162, 969 
P.2d 1275, 1280 (1998)) (holding that the trial court did not err in declining to allow plaintiffs to amend their complaint to clarify that their HRS chapter 480 claim pertained to the sale and marketing of a vehicle theft registration system where plaintiffs proposed to amend claims on which the court had already granted summary judgment and had provided no explanation for the delay). 
Wells Fargo's Complaint, did not allege that it was

 
current or making payments on AOAO dues for the Property. 
Rather, the Complaint alleged only that AOAO's foreclosure
 notices "were legally defective because [they were] not addressed
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3/We have been pointed to no evidence in the record or argument by
counsel that Wells Fargo sought an order shortening time on the motion to
amend (which was otherwise a non-hearing motion) or requested that the hearing
on the motion for summary judgment be delayed until the motion to amend could
be ruled upon.
8to the legal owner of the Property" and that the AOAO lacked any
authority to foreclose.  Wells Fargo, however, never raised the
issue of the AOAO's authority to foreclose in response to the
AOAO's foreclosure or to Omiya's motion for summary judgment and
did not raise the current-on-payments issue until it filed its
memorandum in opposition to Omiya's motion for summary judgment
on January 11, 2012.  Further, it did not seek to amend the
Complaint until the day before the hearing on Omiya's motion for
summary judgment.3/
In addition, Wells Fargo's newly-raised contention that
it was making the required payments was supported by evidence
that Wells Fargo did not produce in response to Omiya's multiple
discovery requests, or the Discovery Order issued by the Circuit
Court on November 22, 2011, to "fully produce all documents
responsive to Omiya's First Request for Production of
Documents[.]"  Although Wells Fargo twice moved to amend the
Complaint through an ex-parte non-hearing motion prior to the
grant of summary judgment, Wells Fargo offered no explanation for
the delay in doing so, and the Circuit Court's order granting
Wells Fargo's first non-hearing motion for leave to include the
payment allegations was not issued until after summary judgment
was granted.  Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err when it
granted Omiya's motion for summary judgment despite Wells Fargo's
belated presentation of evidence to support its claim that it was
current on its obligations to the AOAO.  See Tokuhisa, 122
Hawai#i at 192-93, 223 P.3d at 257-58. 
B.The Circuit Court did not err when it applied Land
Court protections to Omiya as the registered owner ofLand Court property under TCT No. 996,234.
Wells Fargo asserts that Omiya did not demonstrate that
Aames precluded it from challenging the non-judicial foreclosure.
Specifically, Wells Fargo argues that a new TCT number is not the
same as the issuance of a new TCT, and because no new certificateNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of title had been issued in favor of Omiya, Omiya was not
 
entitled to any protection under HRS chapter 501. Wells Fargo
 observes that a new TCT number alone does not include information
 which is contained in the actual certificate such as the names or
 identities of the owners of the real property, the property
 description, and a list of claims and encumbrances with respect
 to the property. In support of its argument, Wells Fargo refers
 to Land Court Rules 52 and 55; In re Application of Bishop Tr.
 Co., 35 Haw. 816 (Terr. 1941); Honolulu Memorial Park, Inc. v.
 City and Cty. of Honolulu, 50 Haw. 189, 436 P.2d 207 (1967); and
 Waikiki Malia Hotel, Inc. v. Kinkai Props. Ltd. P'ship, 75 Haw.
 370, 862 P.2d 1048 (1993). This argument is without merit. The
 cases and Land Court rules provided by Wells Fargo reiterate what
 should be included on a TCT, but fail to support its argument
 that Omiya must show a physical TCT, instead of only providing
 the newly-issued TCT number stamped on the Quitclaim Deed
 recorded at Land Court. 
Land Court is a court of limited jurisdiction created 
for the special purpose of carrying into effect the Torrens title system of land registration.  See In re Estate of Campbell, 66 
Haw. 354, 662 P.2d 206 (1983). In recording a deed, pursuant to Land Court Rule 59, a purchaser must "present[] the deed which contains the proper number of the certificate of the land affected and also contains or has endorsed upon it a full memorandum of all encumbrances affecting the land, if any, or a statement that there are no outstanding encumbrances affecting the land[.]" Haw. Land Ct. R. 59(d). Thereafter, the assistant registrar shall note in the record the date of the instrument's reception, and the instrument shall be stamped with the date, hour, and minute of reception. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 501-107 (Supp. 2009). With that, the instrument "shall be regarded as registered from the date and time so noted[.]" Id. Consistent 
with that, a 1987 report from the State of Hawai
'i, Legislative 
Reference Bureau discussing the consequences of backlog at the Bureau of Conveyances notes that it is "the act of registration" which "shall be the operative act to convey or affect the land." 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Legis. Reference Bureau, Two Land Recording Systems, H.R. 47-7,
 
at 19 (Haw. 1987). 
Pursuant to HRS section 501-82, "every subsequent
 
purchaser of registered land who takes a [TCT] for value and in
 good faith, hold the same free from all encumbrances except those
 noted on the certificate in the order of priority of
 recordation[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 501-82(a) (Supp. 2009). HRS
 section 501-118, asserts that:
 
In case of foreclosure by exercising the power of sale
without a previous judgment, the affidavit required by
chapter 667 shall be recorded with the assistant registrar.
The purchaser or the purchaser's assigns at the foreclosure
sale may thereupon at any time present the deed under the
power of sale to the assistant registrar for recording and
obtain a new certificate. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in
interest from directly impeaching by action or otherwise,
any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land, prior
to the entry of a new certificate of title.
 
After a new certificate of title has been entered, no
judgment recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due
thereon shall operate to open the foreclosure or affect the
title to registered land. 
Haw. Rev. Stat § 501-118 (2006). 
Similarly, in Aames, where the mortgagee sued for 
ejectment of mortgagors following the default of their mortgage, 
a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, and the Land Court's issuance of a TCT to mortgagee, the court held that under HRS section 501­118, "a mortgagor's right to 'impeach[] . . . any foreclosure proceeding' is expressly limited to the period before entry of a new certificate of title." Aames, 107 Hawai
'i at 101, 110 P.3d 
at 1048; Haw. Rev. Stat. § 501-88 (2006) (stating that "[t]he original certificate in the registration book, and any copy thereof duly certified under the signature of the registrar or assistant registrar, and the seal of the court, shall be received as evidence in all the courts of the State and shall be conclusive as to all matters contained therein, except otherwise provided in this chapter"). 
In this case, Omiya presented his Quitclaim Deed to the
 
Land Court, which noted the names of the owners of the real
 property, the property description, and a list of claims and
 encumbrances with respect to the property. The Land Court then
 recorded Omiya's Quitclaim Deed, by stamping the recording date
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of September 15, 2010, "Doc No(s) 3999421 on Cert(s) 940,974" and
 
"Issuance of Cert(s) 996,234" on Omiya's Quitclaim Deed. The
 Land Court's delay in issuing the actual TCT was both evidenced
 by and explained in the Furukawa Declaration, which stated that
 "[t]he Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court is now
 nearly four years behind in physically producing and certifying
 new [TCTs] for properties registered in the Land Court system." 
Moreover, Wells Fargo is bound by its prior judicial 
admission that issuance of the TCT number in this case had the effect of registering title in Omiya's name. See Lee v. Puamana 
Cmty. Ass'n, 109 Hawai
'i 561, 573, 128 P.3d 874, 886 (2006) 
(stating that "[i]t is well established that a party's factual allegation in a complaint or other pleading is a judicial admission which binds the party" (quoting Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local 1357 v. Haw. Tel. Co., 68 Haw. 316, 320 n.2, 713 P.2d 943, 949 n.2 (1986))). 
Specifically, in its Complaint, Wells Fargo asserted 
3. That Defendant DANIEL TSUKASA OMIYA ("Omiya"),
husband of Sandra Sachiko Omiya, whose address is 1314 South
King Street, Suite 1052, Honolulu, 96814 also claims to be
the owner of the Property by virtue of that certain
Quitclaim Deed filed on September 15, 2010 as Document No.
3999421 in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land
Court, State of Hawaii which resulted in the issuance of
 Transfer Certificate of Title No. 996,234 registering title
 
in the name of Defendant Omiya.
 
(Emphasis added.) That the language above amounts to a judicial
 
admission was evidenced when, later, Wells Fargo's counsel filed
 its second non-hearing motion for leave to file a first amended
 complaint and proposed to delete the highlighted text above from
 the paragraph 3 in the Complaint. Furthermore, during the
 January 19, 2012 hearing on Omiya's motion for summary judgment,
 Wells Fargo conceded that it made the above judicial admission in
 paragraph 3 of its Complaint, and the Circuit Court concurred. 
Wells Fargo requested that it be given leave to amend the
 Complaint to withdraw the admission, but the Circuit Court
 correctly declined to consider that request prior to deciding the
 motion for summary judgment.
4/  Thus, Wells Fargo's assertion

 Following its grant of summary judgment in favor of Omiya, the
Circuit Court granted Wells Fargo's first non-hearing motion for leave to file
(continued...)
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that issuance of the TCT number in this case had the effect of 
registering title in Omiya's name is a binding judicial admission. See Lee, 109 Hawai
'i at 573, 128 P.3d at 886. 
Although Wells Fargo's argument that issuance of a TCT
 
number does not have the same effect as issuance of a physical
 TCT is not unreasonable, we conclude that, under the
 circumstances of the Land Court's current operations, which Wells
 Fargo does not challenge or contend it was unaware of, and in
 view of Wells Fargo's judicial admission that issuance of the TCT
 number in this case had the effect of registering title in
 Omiya's name, any challenge to Omiya's title should have been
 initiated prior to September 15, 2010, the date on which Transfer
 Certifiate of Title No. 996,234 was issued to Omiya. Wells
 Fargo, however, did not file its Complaint until November 3,
 2010, almost two months after the issuance of the TCT number to
 Omiya.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Omiya because there was no genuine
 issue of material fact as to Omiya's status as legal owner of the
 Property. See Am. Home Mortg. Serv., Inc. v. Yeung, No. 30057,
 
2011 WL 661794, *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Feb. 23, 2011) (this court,
 upon relying on the fact that a new TCT No. 940,642 was issued
 with no new physical TCT in evidence, applied the protections
 afforded in Aames); Provident Funding Assocs., L.P. v. Vimahi,
 No. 29797, 2010 WL 4491364, at *1-2 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2010)
 (where unlike in Yeung, this court did not note that there was no
 evidence challenging whether a TCT was actually issued, and later
 determined that appellee was "the registered owner of the subject
 property as evidence by TCT No. 918,819[,]" where"[a] Quitclaim
 Deed was recorded . . . as Document No. 3779868 and Transfer
 Certificate of Title [] No. 918,819").

a first amended complaint, which did not include the above changes to

paragraph 3 of the Complaint, but denied Wells Fargo's second non-hearing
motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. Thus, at least during the
time period encompassed by the record on appeal in this case, Wells Fargo's
judicial admission remains boldly-stated in its Complaint.

5/
 In reaching the issue of the allegedly inadequate foreclosure
price, the dissent correctly notes that Omiya attached a 2010 tax assessment
to his Quitclaim Deed. The 2010 tax assessment, however, was not submitted in
relation to Omiya's motion for summary judgment. There, Wells Fargo relied on
a 2012 tax assessment, which shows the Property's value after the non-judicial
foreclosure sale took place. The Property's 2012 value has no bearing on the
value of the Property at the time of Omiya's purchase in 2010. The Property's
2010 value was not argued at summary judgment as a basis for establishing an
inadequate foreclosure price.
