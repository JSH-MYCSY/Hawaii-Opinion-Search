IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHRISTY A. OGAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NOS. 06-1-0394(2) and 07-1-0753(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Christy A. Ogan (Ogan) appeals from
 
the February 19, 2013 "Order of Re-Sentencing, Revocation of
 
Probation" and the February 15, 2013 "Mittmus, Warrant of
 
Commitment to Jail" both entered in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
Second Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Ogan contends the circuit court reversibly
 
erred because: 
(1)
 insufficient evidence supported its finding that
 
she inexcusably failed to comply with substantial terms and
 conditions of her probation;
 
(2) her right to allocution was violated when the
 
circuit court imposed a ten-year prison term without directly and
 
personally inquiring whether she wanted to address the court; and

(3) the sentence imposed upon her was based on facts
 
and evidence that had not been previously disclosed to her and
 
are not found in the record.
 
Under the particular circumstances of this case, and in 
light of Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i's confessions of 
error, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support the circuit court's finding that Ogan inexcusably failed 
to comply with substantial terms and conditions of her probation. 
See State v. Quelnan, 70 Haw. 194, 767 P.2d 243 (1989). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 19, 2013 "Order
 
of Re-Sentencing, Revocation of Probation" and the February 15,
 2013 "Mittimus, Warrant of Commitment to Jail" both entered in
 
the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit are reversed. Ogan's
 
other points on appeal are therefore moot.
