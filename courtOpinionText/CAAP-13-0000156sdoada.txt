(2) a February 22, 2013 post-judgment order granting
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Rodney Y. Sato's (Sato)
 
October 26, 2012 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for attorneys' fees
 
and costs (Order Granting).
 
On May 8, 2009, Sato filed a complaint for breach of
 
contract and promissory estoppel against WHA, WGH, and
 Wahiawa-Central Oahu Health Center (WCOHC).
 
On May 29, 2009, Sato filed a notice of voluntarily
 
dismissal of his complaint as to WCOHC pursuant to HRCP Rule
 41(a)(1).
 
On June 1, 2009, Wahiawa Hospitals answered Sato's
 
complaint and asserted a counterclaim against Sato for
 misrepresentation and negligence.
 
On October 12, 2012, the circuit court
 (1) entered judgment in favor of Sato and against
 
Wahiawa Hospitals as to Sato's cause of action for breach of
 contract relating to Sato's services as a consultant;
 
(2) entered judgment in favor of Wahiawa Hospitals and
 
against Sato as to Sato's cause of action for breach of contract
 relating to Sato's deferred compensation and/or incentive
 remuneration;
 
(3) entered judgment in favor of Wahiawa Hospitals and
 
against Sato as to Sato's cause of action for breach of contract
 relating to Sato's unreimbursed expenses;

against Sato as to Sato's cause of action for promissory
 estoppel; and
 
(5) entered judgment in favor of Sato and against
 
Wahiawa Hospitals as to Wahiawa Hospitals' counterclaim.
 
On October 25, 2012, Wahiawa Hospitals filed an HRCP
 
Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The
 ninetieth day after October 25, 2012, was January 23, 2013, and,
 thus, at the end of the business day on January 23, 2013, Wahiawa
 Hospitals' October 25, 2012 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for
 attorneys' fees and costs was automatically deemed denied by

4(a)(3). 
On October 26, 2012, Sato filed an HRCP Rule 
54(d)(2)(B) motion for attorneys' fees and costs. 
The ninetieth 
day after October 26, 2012, was January 24, 2013, and, thus, at 
the end of the business day on January 24, 2013, Sato's October 26, 2012 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for attorneys' fees and costs was automatically deemed denied by operation of HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
On December 26, 2012, the circuit court entered an 
amended judgment that was substantively identical to the October 12, 2012 judgment, except that the December 26, 2012 amended judgment expressly dismissed all claims by Sato against WCOHC. 
On January 23, 2013, Sato filed a notice of appeal from 
the December 26, 2012 amended judgment. This appeal became appellate court case no. CAAP-13-0000042.
2 On February 5, 2013, 
Wahiawa Hospitals filed a notice of cross-appeal in appellate court case no. CAAP-13-0000042 also from the December 26, 2012 amended judgment. 
On February 11, 2013, the circuit court entered its 
Order Granting/Denying, granting in part and denying in part Wahiawa Hospitals' October 25, 2012 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for attorneys' fees and costs. 
On February 22, 2013, the circuit court entered its 
Order Granting, granting Sato's October 26, 2012 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for attorneys' fees and costs. 
On March 11, 2013, Wahiawa Hospitals filed a notice of 
appeal from the February 11, 2013 Order Granting/Denying and the February 22, 2013 Order Granting in the instant appeal, in which this court has jurisdiction.

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as Sato, CAAP-13-0000042, we vacate the circuit court's
 February 11, 2013 Order Granting/Denying and the February 22,
 2013 Order Granting.
 
In Sato, CAAP-13-0000042, this court held the circuit
 
court erred in dismissing Wahiawa Hospitals' counterclaim based
 on its conclusion that Sato did not breach his duty of loyalty
 such as to warrant complete disgorgement of Sato's fees and costs
 as a consultant adviser. This court additionally held that the
 circuit court erred by dismissing Wahiawa Hospitals' counterclaim
 because Sato breached his duty of loyalty to Wahiawa Hospitals
 and remanded the case to the circuit court to determine whether
 Wahiawa Hospitals is entitled to damages for Sato's breach of his
 duty of loyalty.
 
Since the circuit court's Order Granting/Denying and 
Order Granting were based in part on the entry of judgment in favor of Sato on Wahiawa Hospitals' counterclaim, those orders must be vacated without prejudice to renewed motions for attorney fees and costs subsequent to the circuit court's resolution of Wahiawa Hospitals' claim for damages against Sato for breach of his duty of loyalty. In considering renewed motions for attorney fees and costs, the circuit court shall also reconsider Wahiawa Hospitals' request for attorney fees based on Sato's dismissed promissory estoppel claim, which was in the nature of assumpsit, contrary to the circuit court's ruling on the matter. 808 Dev., 
LLC v. Murakami, 111 Hawai
'i 340, 366, 141 P.3d 996, 1013 (2006); 
Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai 'i 42, 66, 169 P.3d 994, 1018 (App. 2007). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 11, 2013 "Order
 
Granting In Part And Denying In Part 'Defendants The Wahiawa
 Hospital Association And Wahiawa General Hospital's Motion For
 Award of Attorneys' Fees And Costs' Filed October 25, 2012," and
 the February 22, 2013 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Non-Hearing
 Motion For An Award Of Attorneys' Fees As The Prevailing Party
 Under Final Judgment Filed October 12, 2012" both entered in the
