law ("COL") in the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law issued
 
by the Family Court on May 28, 2013 ("FOF/COL"). 
We vacate that portion of the Record of Communication
 
stating that "Hawaii declines jurisdiction[,]" as well as the
 FOF/COL. We instruct the Family Court to defer ruling on
 Father's previous motions, pending a determination as to whether
 it is more appropriate for Florida to exercise jurisdiction
 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 583A-207.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Daughter was born on August 31, 2004 in California. 
Father, Mother, and Daughter apparently lived in Hawai
'i for some 
period of time between November 2005 and August 2007. On August 
20, 2007, Father filed a Petition for Paternity or for Custody, Visitation and Support Orders After Voluntary Establishment of Paternity ("Petition for Paternity"). The petition contended that Daughter was then living in Honolulu with both Mother and Father. That claim notwithstanding, the related Affidavit of Serving Officer Without the State of Hawaii stated that Mother was served with a copy of the petition at an address in Miami Beach, Florida. 
Mother, appearing by telephone, Father, and their
 
respective attorneys were present at a November 1, 2007 return
 date hearing on the Petition for Paternity. On November 13,
 2007, the Family Court entered a Stipulated Judgment of
 Paternity.
2 Legal custody of Daughter was awarded to Mother and
 
Father jointly, and the issue of physical custody was reserved
 for trial. Prior to the scheduled trial, Father and Mother
 resolved physical custody via stipulation on January 3, 2008
 ("Stipulated Joint Custody Order"), with Daughter to spend some
 holidays and two months each summer with Father.
3
 
On March 13, 2009, Father filed a Motion for Relief
 
After Judgment or Order and Declaration, requesting sole physical
 custody of Daughter. Father subsequently filed an Amended Motion

for Relief After Judgment or Order and Declaration on May 7,
 
2009. Father, however, withdrew the motions on June 22, 2009,
 stating that Mother had not been served with the motions. 
More than three years passed and, on August 8, 2012, 
Father filed an Ex Parte Motion for an Order Granting Plaintiff Temporary Sole Custody of His Minor Child or in the Alternative to Shorten the Time For Hearing Plaintiff's Motion for Relief After Judgment or Order and Declaration, which was denied. On August 13, 2012, Father filed another Motion for Relief After Judgment or Order and Declaration ("Motion for Sole Custody"), in which he requested sole physical and legal custody of Daughter. The declaration accompanying the motion appeared to imply, without expressly stating, that, at the time of the filing, Daughter was in Hawai
'i and living with Father. On August 23, 
2012, Father submitted another Ex Parte Motion for an Order Granting Plaintiff Temporary Sole Custody of His Minor Child. On August 28, 2012, the Family Court granted Father's ex parte motion giving him temporary sole physical and legal custody, and ordered a hearing on September 27, 2012. 
On September 13, 2012, Michael A. Glenn entered a
 
special appearance of counsel on behalf of Mother, in order to
 contest the Family Court's jurisdiction. On September 17, 2012,
 Glenn submitted an "Order Setting Hearing," dated September 13,
 2012, from the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in
 and for Palm Beach County, Florida ("Florida court"). According
 to the order, Mother had filed an emergency verified petition to
 domesticate and enforce out of state custody agreement
 ("Emergency Verified Petition") in the Florida court.
4
 
On September 27, 2012, the Family Court stayed the 
proceedings in Hawai 'i, pending communication between the Family 
Court and the Florida court. The September 27, 2012 hearing was postponed until the originally scheduled December 6, 2012 hearing on Father's Motion for Sole Custody, and then again until 
February 28, 2013.

 It is not clear from the record when the Emergency Verified
Petition was filed. In her answering brief, however, Mother states that it
was filed on September 12, 2012.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Family Court held a telephone conference call with 
the Florida court on February 7, 2013, at 12:00 p.m. ET, with the 
call transcribed by a stenographer in Florida. According to the transcription, also present on the conference call were Grant Gisondo, an attorney for Mother, and Jason Brodie, an attorney for Father located in Florida. Father's Florida attorney objected to the fact that he, Father, and Father's Hawai
'i 
attorney had received no notice of the conference setting; and that neither Father nor his Hawai
'i attorney were present for the 
call because the Hawai 'i courthouse was not open. Counsel stated 
that "my client wanted to be able to present evidence and testimony and legal argument, as he's entitled to." 
The Florida court responded: 
"This conference was set up and we had a hearing the other
day. You were notified of that. If you had . . . wanted
those parties to also be available, they would either be in
this courtroom or you could have set it up on a proper
telephonic conference situation, but as it is, this has been
a previously-set hearing . . . ." 
The Florida court stated that it was the home state of the child 
under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act 
("Uniform Act") and that on "the issue of forum non conveniens," 
the best place for jurisdiction was Florida. The Florida court suggested that the Family Court decline jurisdiction and the Family Court agreed. The Florida court stated that it would make "some determination [of] what's in the best interest of this child" with regard to staying with her schooling in Hawai
'i. Mr. 
Gisondo made an oral motion for visitation or return of Daughter to Mother. The Florida court advised Mr. Gisondo "to make a formal motion so all the parties can have an opportunity to address this[.]" 
On February 19, 2013, the Family Court filed the Record
 
of Communication, stating that "[the Florida court] and [Family
 Court] agreed that it is appropriate for Florida to have
 jurisdiction. Hawaii declines jurisdiction." That same day, the
 Family Court set aside the February 28, 2013 hearing on Father's
 Motion for Sole Custody.

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 18, 2013, the Family Court entered an Order to
 
Submit Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which
 
advised that an appeal had been taken in the case and directed
 the parties to submit proposed FOF and COL within ten days of the
 notice of appeal. Mother and Father submitted proposed FOF and
 COL on April 11, 2013, and April 12, 2013, respectively. 
On March 22, 2013, Father filed a "Motion for Relief
 
from the Orders of 2/19/13 Pursuant to [Hawai
'i Family Court 
Rules] Rule 60; In the Alternative, to Stay the Orders of
 2/19/13" ("Motion for Relief"). The Family Court held a hearing
 on the Motion for Relief on May 23, 2013, and denied the motion.
 
The Family Court entered the FOF/COL on May 28, 2013.
 
FOF 3 provided that "[f]rom 2006 until mid-2012, [Daughter] lived
 primarily with Mother in Florida, and visited with Father in
 Hawaii." FOFs 12-15 stated as follows:
 
12. During the communication between [the Family]
Court and the [Florida court], Mother and her Florida
counsel, and Father's counsel were present in [Florida
court].
 
13. A recorded transcript was made of this
communication.
 
14. The [Florida court] determined that the State of
Florida had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the
parties. It was also noted during the communication that
most of the evidence is in Florida.
 
15. [The Family] Court and the [Florida court]
determined, and agreed, that Florida is the more appropriate
forum. Hawaii declined jurisdiction.
 
The COLs stated, in relevant part, as follows:
 
3. Under HRS Section 583A-110(a) [ 5
] , a court of
this State may communicate with a court in another state
concerning a proceeding arising under the [Uniform Act]. 
. . . . 
9. HRS Section 583A-110 was complied with.
 
10. HRS Section 583A-206 governs simultaneous
proceedings.
 
11. Under HRS Section 583A-206(a), a court of Hawaii
shall not exercise its jurisdiction if, at the time of the
commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the
custody of the child has been commenced in a court of

courts regarding jurisdictional issues related to child-custody proceedings.

another state having jurisdiction substantially in
conformity with the [Uniform Act].
 
. . . .
 
16. Under Section 583A-206(b), if the court of the
state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with
the [Uniform Act] does not determine that the court of this
State is a more appropriate forum, the court of this State
shall dismiss the proceeding.
 
. . . .
 
20. [The Family] Court properly and correctly, after
communicating with the Florida court, declined jurisdiction
in this matter.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Father contends that (1) FOF 3 is clearly
 
erroneous because Hawai 'i was Daughter's home state from 
2005–2008, when Father filed his paternity petition, and (2) COLs
 
10–20 are clearly wrong.6
  
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Whether the family court properly exercised
 
jurisdiction is a question of law which we review de novo. In re
 
Doe, 96 Hawai 'i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001). 
"A trial court's FOFs are subject to the clearly erroneous
standard of review." Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai' i 386,
393, 114 P.3d 892, 899 (2005) (citations omitted). 
An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to
support the finding, the appellate court is left with
the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the
entire evidence that a mistake has been committed. An
 FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding. We have
 defined substantial evidence as credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
6
 Father's points of error do not comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b)(4). As the Hawai' i Supreme Court has
noted, however, "[N]oncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result indismissal of the claims, and 'this court . . . has consistently adhered to thepolicy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the
merits, where possible.'" Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 496, 280 P.3d
88, 94 (2012) (original brackets omitted) (quoting Morgan v. Planning Dept. 
104 Hawai' i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004)). Here, to the extent
that we are able to discern with reasonable clarity the alleged errorcommitted by the Family Court, and where in the record the alleged erroroccurred, and taking into account that the FOF/COL were not filed until afterFather filed his notice of appeal, we will consider the issues on their
merits. See Liki v. First Fire & Cas. Ins. of Hawaii, Inc., 118 Hawai' i 123,
126 n.3, 185 P.3d 871, 874 n.3 (App. 2008).

Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 51, 85 P.3d 150, 158 (2004)
(quoting Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai' i 289,
305, 30 P.3d 895, 911 (2001)). 
The appellate court reviews the trial court’s COLs de
novo. A COL is not binding upon an appellate court
and is freely reviewable for its correctness.
Moreover, a COL that is supported by the trial court’s
FOFs and that reflects an application of the correct
rule of law will not be overturned.

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. HRS § 583A-206. 
The Uniform Act governs jurisdictional issues that
 
arise in interstate child custody proceedings and is codified in
Hawai
'i in HRS chapter 583A. H AW.  REV.  STAT.  § 583A-101 (2006). 
It was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on
 Uniform State Laws in 1997, and enacted by the Hawai
'i 
Legislature in 2002. 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 124, §§ 1 & 2 at
 335-48. 
 
On appeal, Father challenges COLs 10–20 of the
 
FOF/COL,
7
 in which the Family Court essentially concluded that
Father's Motion for Sole Custody and Mother's Emergency Verified
 Petition constituted "simultaneous proceedings" under HRS § 583A­206 ("Section 206").
8 Father asserts that Hawai 'i had exclusive, 
7
 Father also challenges FOF 3 on the basis that Hawai' i was the 
child's home state from 2005-2008. Father's argument is limited to the
contention that the FOF is contrary to the evidence that Hawai' i was 
Daughter's home state. Father provides no further argument and includes nocitations to where this purported evidence is located in the record or how itmight affect the challenged FOF. Father's bare contention provides us with aninsufficient basis upon which to evaluate whether FOF 3 is clearly erroneous. 
8
 Mother maintains that Father "PURPOSEFULLY AVOID[ED] even the
mention of HRS § 583A-206, so much so that Rule 11 sanctions may be in orderfor the frivolous nature of the legal argument . . . ." We interpret Motherto refer to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 11. Father's 
argument, however, is premised on the fact that a different section of HRSChapter 583A applies, not Section 206. The argument is "non-frivolous" forpurposes of HRCP Rule 11(b)(3). Although a citation to Section 206 may haveclarified Father's second point of error, omitting it does not warrantsanctions and should not prevent this court from reviewing the merits ofFather's arguments.

continuing jurisdiction over the child custody determination
 
9
pursuant to HRS § 583A-202,  that Mother's subsequent relocation 
to Florida with Daughter did not affect the jurisdiction of the
 
Family Court, and that, therefore, Section 206 is inapplicable. 
1.	 FOF3 appears to conflict with the Family
Court's earlier assumption of jurisdiction.
 
A family court has jurisdiction to make an initial
 
child-custody determination in certain limited circumstances. 
HRS § 583A-201 provides that:
 
Initial child-custody jurisdiction. (a) Except as
otherwise provided in section 583A-204, a court of this
State has jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody
determination only if:
 
(1)	 This State is the home state of the child on the
 date of the commencement of the proceeding, or
was the home state of the child within six
 months before the commencement of the proceeding
and the child is absent from this State but a
 parent or person acting as a parent continues to
live in this State;
 
(2)	 A court of another state does not have
 jurisdiction under paragraph (1), or a court of
the home state of the child has declined to
 exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this
State is the more appropriate forum under
section 583A-207 or 583A-208, and:
 
(A)	 The child and the child's parents, or the
child and at least one parent or a person
acting as a parent, have a significant
connection with this State other than mere
 physical presence; and
 
(B)	 Substantial evidence is available in this
 State concerning the child's care,
protection, training, and personal

 HRS § 583A-202 provides, in relevant part:
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204,
a court of this State which has made a child-custody
determination consistent with section 583A-201 or 583A-203
 
has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the
 
determination until:
 
(1)	 A court of this State determines that the
 child, the child's parents, and any person
acting as a parent do not have a
significant connection with this State and
 
that substantial evidence is no longer
available in this State concerning the
child's care, protection, training, and
personal relationships[.]

relationships;
 
(3)	 All courts having jurisdiction under paragraph
(1) or (2) have declined to exercise
jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this
State is the more appropriate forum to determine
the custody of the child under section 583A-207
or 583A-208; or
 
(4)	 No court of any other state would have
jurisdiction under the criteria specified in
paragraph (1), (2), or (3).
 
(b) Subsection (a) shall be the exclusive
jurisdictional basis for making a child-custody
determination by a court of this State.
 
(c) Physical presence of, or personal jurisdiction
over, a party or a child shall not be necessary or
sufficient to make a child-custody determination.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 583A-201 (2006). 
The Family Court did not explain the basis for 
asserting, nor did either party contest the court's assertion of, 
jurisdiction to enter the initial custody orders—the November 13, 2007 Stipulated Judgment of Paternity and the January 3, 2008 Stipulated Joint Custody Order. Nevertheless, without apparently intending to contest the Family Court's initial assumption of jurisdiction, the parties do dispute whether Hawai
'i was 
Daughter's home state between 2007 and 2008. 
Resolution of the home state question could affect the
 
Family Court's jurisdiction over the initial custody proceedings
 if Daughter's home state was the basis for the Family Court's
 jurisdiction. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 583A-201(a)(1) (providing
 
jurisdiction where a state is the "home state of the child on the
 date of the commencement of the proceeding."). The parties offer
 no argument on this issue or any of the other potential bases for
 jurisdiction, see H
AW. REV. STAT. § 583A-201(a)(2), (3), and (4),
 
and there is nothing in the record apart from the Family Court's
 
10
unexplained FOF 3  to suggest that the Family Court did not have
jurisdiction. Therefore, although the Family Court will need to
 
10
 FOF 3 is unsupported by the transcript of the February 7, 2013,
telephone call between the Florida court and the Family Court, and implicitly
conflicts with the Family Court's earlier assumption of jurisdiction in the
Stipulated Judgment of Paternity and the subsequent Stipulated Joint Custody
Order.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consider the factual basis for its FOF 3 on remand,11 that
 
jurisdiction is unchallenged and at this point unreviewable here. 
Therefore, we proceed to consider whether, if jurisdiction was
 properly first assumed, the Family Court's subsequent decision to
 decline jurisdiction was proper.
 
2.	 Assuming that the Family Court properly
exercised initial jurisdiction, it thereafter
had exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over
the child-custody proceedings.
 
Pursuant to the Uniform Act, the State which has 
properly made an initial "child-custody determination"
12 
continues to have exclusive, original jurisdiction over that 
determination. H AW. REV. STAT. § 583A-202. Thus, assuming as we 
do here that the Family Court properly made the initial child-custody determination several years before the Florida court became involved, Hawai
'i continued to have "exclusive, continuing 
jurisdiction" over any attempt to modify the original orders as to legal and physical custody. H
AW. REV. STAT. §§ 583A-202(a)(1) 
and (2). This jurisdiction would continue until the Family Court explicitly declined jurisdiction or none of the parties remained in Hawai
'i. See Beam v. Beam, 126 Hawai 'i 58, 60-61, 266 P.3d 
466, 468-69 (App. 2011) ("When a Hawai 'i court properly asserts 
jurisdiction and makes an initial child custody determination, that court retains 'exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the determination.'" (quoting HRS § 583A-202)). 
3.	 Section 206, addressing simultaneous proceedings,
did not apply.
 
It is apparent from the challenged COLs that the Family
 
Court in this instance declined jurisdiction over the custody
 
11
 Any revisitation of the Family Court's initial determination of
jurisdiction at this point must consider the principles of judicial economy
and judicial finality as outlined, in an analogous situation, in Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai' i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439, 452 (2011). 
12
 "Child-custody determination" is defined as "a judgment, decree,
or other order of a court providing for legal custody, physical custody, or
visitation with respect to a child. The term includes a permanent, temporary,
initial, and modification order. The term does not include an order relating
to child support or other monetary obligation of an individual." H
AW. REV.
 
STAT. § 583A-102 (2006).

proceedings on the basis of Section 206. That provision states,
 
in relevant part:
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204,
a court of this State shall not exercise its jurisdiction
under this part if, at the time of the commencement of the
 proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child
has been commenced in a court of another state having
jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this chapter,
unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by
 
the court of the other state because a court of this State
 is a more convenient forum under section 583A-207.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 206(a) (2006) (emphases added). 
This provision is not applicable in the instant case
 
for two reasons. First, it is not applicable where there is a
 
State with already-established, exclusive, continuing
 jurisdiction. The comment to section 206 of the Uniform Act
 provides that "[u]nder this Act, the simultaneous proceedings
 problem will arise only when there is no home State, no State
 with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction and more than one
 significant connection State." Uniform Act § 206 cmt. (1997).
13
  
It notes that "[i]f there is a State of exclusive, continuing
 jurisdiction, there cannot be another State with concurrent
 jurisdiction, and therefore, no simultaneous proceedings."
14   Id.
  
As established, it is uncontested that Hawai 'i had exclusive, 
continuing jurisdiction over the child-custody proceedings in
 this case. Therefore, the simultaneous proceedings section of
 the Uniform Act does not apply. 
Second, even if we were to ignore Hawai 'i's exclusive, 
continuing jurisdiction on the basis of the Petition for
 Paternity, and if we were to assume for the sake of argument that
 there was concurrent jurisdiction with Florida over the

 The cases cited by Mother in her answering brief are either
distinguishable, or else serve only to support this conclusion. See Crook v.
 
Fujino, No. 29965, 2009 WL 2477527, at *1 (Haw. Aug. 7, 2009) (holding that
HRS § 583A-206 did not apply because the other state did not have jurisdiction
in conformity with the Uniform Act); SW v. Duncan, 24 P.3d 846 (Okla. 2001)
(court properly made initial custody determination, and thus could proceed
with custody modification despite the fact that a Kansas modification
proceeding on the same custody matter had commenced prior to the Oklahoma
modification proceeding); Malissa C. v. Matthew Wayne H., 193 P.3d 569, 575
(N.M. Ct. App. 2008) (holding that simultaneous proceedings provision did not
apply because other state did not have "jurisdiction substantially in
conformity" with the Uniform Act).
 
11
    
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subsequent custody proceedings, section 206 of the Uniform Act
 
contains a "first in time" rule. See id.  That is, the State in
 
which the proceeding is commenced first will exercise
 jurisdiction, unless it declines to do so because of inconvenient
 forum. The plain language of HRS § 583A-206 provides that where,
 "at the time of the commencement
[ 15
] of the proceeding [in State
A]
, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been
 
commenced in a court of another state [(State B)]," State A may
 not exercise jurisdiction unless State B declines to do so. H
AW.
 
REV. STAT. § 583A-206(a) (emphasis added).
 
In this case, the parties do not dispute that the 
custody proceedings commenced first in Hawai 'i when Father filed 
his Motion for Sole Custody in the Family Court. Thus, Hawai 'i 
is "State B" in the quoted excerpt above. Therefore, when Mother filed her Emergency Verified Petition in the Florida court, Florida became "State A", because the proceedings there were commenced second in time. Accordingly, pursuant to the simultaneous proceedings provision, Florida could not have exercised jurisdiction unless Hawai
'i first declined because it 
determined that Florida was a more convenient forum. Id. Thus, 
the Family Court's COLs 10-20 were incorrect because Section 206 was not relevant to the proceedings. 
B. HRS § 583A-207
 
In the alternative, and despite the language of COLs
 
10–20, the Family Court's determination could be construed as an
 
"inconvenient forum" determination made pursuant to HRS § 583A­207 ("Section 207"). The Florida court mentioned "the issue of
 forum non conveniens" during the conference call, and, in its COL
 20, the Family Court characterized its decision as "declin[ing]
 jurisdiction." 
Assuming that the Family Court properly declined
 
jurisdiction as an "inconvenient forum", and dismissed the
 action, Florida could proceed pursuant to the Uniform Act. See

continuing jurisdiction may relinquish jurisdiction when it
 
determines that another State would be a more convenient forum
 under the principles of Section 207."). 
Section 207 provides, in pertinent part, that:
 
(a) A court of this State which has jurisdiction under
this chapter to make a child-custody determination may
 
decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it
 
determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the
 circumstances and that a court of another state is a more
 appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be
raised upon the motion of a party, the court's own motion,
or request of another court.
 
(b) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient
 
forum, a court of this State shall consider whether it is
 appropriate for a court of another state to exercise
jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the
 parties to submit information and shall consider all
 
relevant factors, including:
 
(1)	 Whether domestic violence has occurred and is
 likely to continue in the future and which state
could best protect the parties and the child;
 
(2)	 The length of time the child has resided outside
this State;
 
(3)	 The distance between the court in this State and
 the court in the state that would assume
 jurisdiction;
 
(4)	 The relative financial circumstances of the
 parties;
 
(5)	 Any agreement of the parties as to which state
should assume jurisdiction;
 
(6)	 The nature and location of the evidence
 required to resolve the pending
litigation, including testimony of the
child;
 
(7)	 The ability of the court of each state to decide
the issue expeditiously and the procedures
necessary to present the evidence;
 
(8)	 The familiarity of the court of each state with
the facts and issues in the pending litigation;
and
 
(9)	 The physical and psychological health of the
parties.
 
(c) If a court of this State determines that it is an
inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a
 more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon
condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly
commenced in another designated state and may impose any
other condition the court considers just and proper.

A family court's decision to decline jurisdiction is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Fisher v. Fisher, 111 
Hawai'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) ("'[An appellate court] 
will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless 
the family court disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.'" (quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i 183, 189–90, 20 P.3d 616, 622–23 (2001))). 
The language of Section 207 states that a court "shall
 
consider all relevant factors" and "allow the parties to submit
 information". H
AW. REV. STAT. § 583A-207(b). Numerous other
 
jurisdictions have held that where a court declines jurisdiction
 without considering all of the statutory factors in its
 equivalent of subsection (b) of Section 207, or allowing the
 parties to present facts or arguments, it constitutes an abuse of
 discretion.
16 See, e.g., Cole v. Cushman, 946 A.2d 430, 435 (Me.
 
2008) (court abused its discretion because it did not consider
 the factors listed in Maine's equivalent of subsection (b) of
 Section 207); Watson v. Watson, 724 N.W.2d 24, 34 (Neb. 2006)
 ("After a court of this state has declined to exercise its
 jurisdiction under the [Uniform Act], the objecting party is
 entitled to know that the trial court has engaged in a proper
 consideration of 'all relevant factors' and to a record that
 allows for meaningful appellate review."); In re Custody of
 N.G.H., 92 P.3d 1215, 1218 (Mont. 2004) (reversing the lower
 court's determination not to exercise jurisdiction because it
 failed to consider the factors under Montana's version of the
 Uniform Act); Harris v. Harris, 922 N.E.2d 626, 640 (Ind. Ct.
 App. 2010) (court's failure to allow the parties to present
 arguments on inconvenient forum was reversible error).
 
Here, the Family Court did not make findings as to any
 
of the statutory factors in Section 207, but simply stated that
 
16
 Inasmuch as we address the application of a uniform act, the
application by other jurisdictions is instructive. HRS § 1-24 provides that
"[a]ll provisions of uniform acts adopted by the State shall be so interpreted
and construed as to effectuate their general purpose to make uniform the laws
of the states and territories which enact them." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 1-24 (2009
Repl.).

it "properly and correctly, after communicating with the Florida
 
court, declined jurisdiction in this matter." Irrespective of
 the theory under which the Family Court proceeded, in light of
 the court's failure to make any Section 207-related findings, and
 the apparent inconsistency between FOF 3 and the court's earlier
 assumption of jurisdiction, we cannot properly determine whether
 the court abused its discretion in declining jurisdiction.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate that portion of
 
the February 19, 2013 Record of Communication stating that
 
"Hawaii declines jurisdiction[,]" and the May 28, 2013 Findings
 of Fact and Conclusions of Law in its entirety. The case is
 remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
 
Because it is not apparent from the record what
 
proceedings have occurred in Florida subsequent to the Family
 Court's entrance of the February 19, 2013 Order Setting Aside
 Hearing Date and Record of Communication, the Family Court should
 defer ruling on Father's previous motions, including his Motion
 for Sole Custody, pending a new determination on remand by the
 Family Court as to whether it should decline jurisdiction
 pursuant to Section 207 in favor of Florida. In addition, in
 order to avoid inconsistent custody orders, the Family Court
 should consider entry of an interim custody order consistent with
 any custody modification that has taken place in Florida, pending
 the outcome of those determinations.
