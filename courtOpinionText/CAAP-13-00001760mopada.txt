proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion. 
I. BACKGROUND 
K. Puanani Holt-Kay ("Borrower") purchased property
located in Pukalani, Hawai #i ("Property") and executed a Note and
Mortgage in favor of Option One Mortgage Corporation in the
principal amount of $558,000 on April 18, 2007.  Wells Fargo was
assigned the Mortgage effective on February 4, 2009 and recorded
the assignment with the State of Hawai# i Bureau of Conveyances
("Bureau") on March 20, 2009.  The Mortgage provides that
21
. Acceleration; Remedies. If any installment under the
Note or notes sec
ured hereby is , or if
Borrower should be in default under any provision of this
Security Instrument, or if Borrower is in default under any
other mortgage or other instrument secured by the Property,
all sums secured by this Security Instrument and accrued
interest thereon shall at once become due and payable at the
option of Lender without prior notice, except as otherwise
required by applicable law, and regardless of any prior
forbearance. In such event, Lender, at its option, and subject
to applicable law, may then or thereafter invoke the power of
sale and/or any other remedies or take any other actions
permitted by applicable law. . . . not paid when due

Modification. This Security Instrument may be
modified or amended only by an agreement in writing signed by
Borrower and Lender.
(Emphasis added).
Borrower fell behind on payments and into default.  
Wells Fargo initiated nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings by
publishing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation stating
that it intended to foreclose on the Property via auction on
June 5, 2009.  On April 20, 2009, Wells Fargo recorded a Notice
of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale
("Notice") with the Bureau, which stated that Wells Fargo
intended to foreclose on the Property via auction on June 5,
2009, and included the time, location, and terms of the sale.  
See Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 667-5 (Supp. 2008).2/ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

The attorney shall:
(1)Give notice of the mortgagee's [or]

the date and time of a postponed auction, or if the
auction is canceled, information that the auction was
canceled. The mortgagee within thirty days after selling
the property in pursuance of the power, shall file a

affidavit, setting forth the mortgagee's acts in the
premises fully and particularly, in the bureau of
conveyances.
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง667-5(a) & (d).
3In its opening brief, Wells Fargo explains that while
its servicing agents were attempting to work out a loan
modification with Borrower, its attorneys and other agents were
proceeding with the foreclosure process.  Borrower first
submitted a request for loan modification and supporting
documents in a letter to American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.,
Mitigation Department, Wells Fargo's servicing agent
("Servicer"), dated May 16, 2009.  On June 1, 2009, Servicer
spoke with Borrower regarding a potential loan modification, and
Borrower informed Servicer of additional income which, she
claimed, would allow her to get back on schedule.  Borrower faxed
verification of the income to Servicer on June 3, 2009, and on
June 4, 2009, Servicer placed the foreclosure of the Property on
hold in its internal tracking system.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4Irrespective of the internal hold placed on the
foreclosure process, on June 5, 2009, Wells Fargo's attorneys
auctioned off the Property in accordance with the Notice.  Robert
N. Fabrique was the high bidder.  Thereafter, Fabrique tendered
deposits in the total amount of $30,000 to another of Wells
Fargo's agents, FEI LLC ("FEI").  The deposit was accompanied by
an explanation that the owner would hold the Property in the name
of Hiwalani P S Holdings, LLC ("Holdings").  In return, FEI
tendered Fabrique a receipt ("Receipt") for the deposit dated
June 5, 2009, which identified Fabrique as "the successful bidder
at the foreclosure sale of the property."  The Receipt was signed
by FEI and identified FEI as the "Trustee's Agent."  In addition,
Fabrique provided Vesting Instructions to FEI on the form
provided by FEI.  Together, the Receipt and the Vesting
Instructions contained the deposit amount, total purchase price,
purchaser name, seller name, date of sale, form of tenancy, and
identified the property that the deposits should go towards.  On
June 8, 2009, Wells Fargo informed Holdings that Wells Fargo
intended to cancel the sale.
Holdings and Fabrique (collectively "Hiwalani") filed a
complaint for breach of contract against Wells Fargo.  Wells
Fargo moved for summary judgment, and the motion was granted. 
Hiwalani appealed and this court in an unpublished memorandum
opinion remanded the case to the Circuit Court, stating that
"[w]hether there was a pre-auction agreement that cured
Borrower's default and caused the subsequent auction to be
invalid is a genuine issue of material fact that would have the
effect of establishing or refuting whether the requirement was
met that a borrower be in default before a foreclosure sale takes
place."  Hiwalani PS Holdings, LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank , No. CAAP-
10-0000148, 2012 WL 593098, at *4 (Haw. App. Feb 23, 2012)
(hereinafter " Hiwalani I ").
On remand, Wells Fargo moved to amend its answer to
include a statute of frauds defense and Hiwalani filed a motion
for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.  The
Circuit Court denied Wells Fargo's motion to amend on the basis
of futility and issued its Order Granting Partial SummaryNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5Judgment, which also awarded $118,000 in damages to Hiwalani. 
The Circuit Court then issued its Order for Fees.  Wells Fargo
appeals.
II. POINTS OF ERROR
On appeal, Wells Fargo contends that the Circuit Court
erred (1) in ruling that a valid contract was formed because the
auction was void, (2) in rejecting Wells Fargo's argument against 
formation of a contract based upon mistake, (3) in rejecting
Wells Fargo's motion to amend its answer on the basis of
futility, (4) by considering Hiwalani's damage claim that was
first submitted in Plaintiff's reply memorandum, (5) in finding
that Hiwalani had proved it was entitled to damages in excess of
the return of its deposit plus interest, and (6) in awarding
Hiwalani attorneys' fees, costs, and prejudgment interest because
Hiwalani was not the prevailing party. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
Summary Judgment
"An award of summary judgment is reviewed de novo under
the same standard applied by the circuit court."  French v.
Hawai#i Pizza Hut, Inc. , 105 Hawai# i 462, 466, 99 P.3d 1046,
1050 (2004) (citing Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv.
Co., 74 Haw. 85, 104, 839 P.2d 10, 22 (1992)) . . . .  The
standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is well
settled:
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the
pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together
with the affidavits, if any, show that there is
no genuine issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.  A fact is material if proof of
that fact would have the effect of establishing
or refuting one of the essential elements of a
cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the
light most favorable to the non-moving party.  In
other words, we must view all of the evidence and
the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.

Motion to Amend Answer
"[T]he grant or denial of leave to amend [an answer]
under Rule 15(a)[, Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP"),]is
within the discretion of the trial court."  Associated Eng'rs &
Contractors, Inc. v. State, 58 Haw. 187, 218, 567 P.2d 397, 417
(1977) (citing Bishop Trust Co. v. Kamokila Dev. Corp., 57 Haw.
330, 555 P.2d 1193 (1976)).
Attorneys' Fees and Costs
"The trial court's rulings concerning the award of
attorneys' fees and costs are generally reviewed under the abuse
of discretion standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua
v. Wailea Resort Co. Ltd. , 100 Hawai #i 97, 120, 58 P.3d 608, 631

Interest (Awards of) - Granting/Denying Prejudgment Interest
Prejudgment interest, where appropriate, is awardable
under [Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section] 636-16
[(1993)] in the discretion of the court.  Generally, to
constitute an abuse of discretion it must appear that the
court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant.
  
Schmidt v. Bd. of Dirs. of the Ass'n of Apartment Owners of the
Marco Polo Apartments , 73 Haw. 526, 533, 836 P.2d 479, 483 (1992)
(citations omitted).
IV. DISCUSSION
A.Wells Fargo's motion to amend
Wells Fargo argues that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion when it denied Wells Fargo's motion to amend its
answer to include a statute of frauds defense.  HRCP Rule 15
provides that a pleading may be amended once and within 20 days
of filing as a matter of course.  After 20 days have passed, "a
party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by
written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely
given when justice so requires."  Haw. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  The
trial court based its ruling on the grounds that the amendmentNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7would be futile.  In order for us to determine if the Circuit
Court abused its discretion, we first consider if an amendment to
raise a statute of frauds defense would have been futile. 
Hawai#i's statute of frauds provides, in pertinent
part:
No action shall be brought and maintained . . . [u]pon any
contract for the sale of lands . . . unless the . . .
contract . . . upon which the action is brought, or some
memorandum or note thereof, is in writing, and is signed by
the party to be charged therewith, or by some person
thereunto by the party in writing lawfully authorized.
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 656-1 (1993).  Between the Notice, the Receipt,
and the Vesting Instructions, all necessary terms of the contract
and the signature of the party against whom enforcement is sought
are present.  See Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 656-1.  "To satisfy the
requirements of the Statute [of frauds], the writing need merely
state 'with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the
unperformed promises in the contract.'"  Burgess v. Arita, 5 Haw.
App. 581, 588, 704 P.2d 930, 936 (1985) (quoting Restatement
(Second) of Contracts ยง 131 (1981)).  Accordingly, a statute of
frauds defense is futile, and allowing an amendment to Wells
Fargo's answer is equally futile.  Wells Fargo fails to establish
how the Circuit Court's denial of the motion to amend violated
the court's duty to allow amendment when justice so requires. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
denying Wells Fargo's motion to amend.
B.Hiwalani's motion for partial summary judgment
Wells Fargo contends that the foreclosure sale was not
conducted in compliance with either the mortgage's power of sale
clause or HRS section 667-5 because its internal system reflected
a hold on the foreclosure sale, and that such a hold reflected
that it no longer desired to foreclose upon the Property. 
Consequently, Wells Fargo argues, no valid contract could have
been formed because it did not intend to execute the option in
the mortgage.  This argument is without merit.
The existence of mutual assent or intent to accept is
determined by an objective standard.  A party's words or
acts are judged under a standard of reasonableness in
determining whether he has manifested an objective intention
to agree.  All reasonable meanings will be imputed as
representative of a party's corresponding objectiveNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8intention. Unexpressed intentions are nugatory when the
problem is to ascertain the legal relations, if any, between
two parties.
United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Dawson Int'l,
Inc., 113 Hawai #i 127, 141, 149 P.3d 495, 509 (2006) (quoting
Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Constr. Inc ., 56 Haw. 466, 470-71,
540 P.2d 978, 982 (1975)).
From an outsider's perspective, Wells Fargo intended to
sell the Property.  Among other things, it hired agents to file
the Notice with the Bureau; advertise the prospective sale of the
Property in the newspaper; conduct the sale of the Property in
accordance with the specified date, time, and location; accept
Holdings' $30,000 deposit; provide acknowledgment of the sale to
Fabrique as the "successful bidder"; and take instructions to
escrow from Fabrique regarding vesting of title to the Property.  
Furthermore, the Notice included explicit terms of the sale,
including "[n]o upset price," "[a]t the close of the auction,
Purchaser shall pay at least 10% of the highest successful bid
price . . . in cash," and that "[t]he property shall be conveyed
. . . within 30 days . . . and upon performance by Purchaser, no
later than 21 days after the auction, of the following
obligations[.]"  The Notice further stated that by bidding a
potential purchaser indicates an agreement to be bound, and
provided penalties for subsequent nonperformance of the
Purchaser, including "[i]n the event the sale does not close
because of any delay in performance by the Purchaser . . ., the
10% down payment may be retained by Mortgagee as liquidation
damage[s]."  In sum, Wells Fargo followed the requirements of HRS
section 667-5 and the Notice in conducting the sale. 
While some of Wells Fargo's agents had a different
intention, it is clear that other Wells Fargo agents intended
that Wells Fargo sell the Property pursuant to the Notice.  Thus,
it was not unreasonable for Holdings, or any prospective
purchaser in Holdings' shoes, to conclude that Wells Fargo
intended to complete the sale once a prospective buyer fulfilled
the terms of the Notice.  Further, there was no cure of the
default or a loan modification agreement at the time of the sale.
As we explained in Hiwalani I, Lee v. HSBC Bank USA , 121 Hawai #iNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9287, 218 P.3d 775 (2009) is inapposite "[b]ecause the borrowers
in Lee were no longer in default, they were no longer in breach
of the mortgage, and defendant no longer had the power of sale
pursuant to the mortgage and HRS ยง 667-5."  Hiwalani I , 2012 WL
593098, at *4.  Therefore, there was no material fact in dispute
as to the legitimacy of the contract for the sale and purchase of
the Property.
Alternatively, Wells Fargo argued that the right to
cure extends to the time of conveyance, relying upon Lee, Kondaur
Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawai# i 227, 361 P.3d 454
(2015), Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai# i 137, 366 P. 3d 612
(2016), and Mount v. Apao, No. SCWC-13-0002977, 2016 WL 6471261
(Haw. Nov. 1, 2016).  While these cases addressed conditions that
a mortgagee must meet when nonjudicially foreclosing on a
mortgage, the cases are distinguishable.  In Santiago, as in Lee
discussed above, there was an actual cure of the underlying
default before the nonjudicial auction, whereas in this case,
Wells Fargo conceded that there was neither a pre- nor post-sale
cure of the default.  In addition, Mount and Kondaur are
inapposite because unlike in those cases, Wells Fargo does not
establish that there was non-compliance with the requirements for
a valid nonjudicial foreclosure sale or demonstrate a material
factual dispute regarding non-compliance.  See  Kondaur, 136
Hawai#i at 243โ44, 361 P.3d at 470โ71 (where a self-dealing
transaction requires additional consideration of the factors
found in Ulrich v. Security Inv. Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Terr. 1902));
Mount, 2016 WL 6471261, at *11โ12 (stating that prior to a
nonjudicial foreclosure, a person entitled to notice should also
receive information regarding the amount to cure, if requested). 
Accordingly, Lee , Kondaur , Santiago , and Mount do not preclude
enforcement of the contract entered into between Wells Fargo and
Holdings. 
C.
 The Circuit Court's award of damages, attorneys' fees,
and prejudgment interest
Wells Fargo argues that the Circuit Court erred in
awarding Hiwalani damages based on evidence first submitted in
its reply brief.  "The movant may file and serve a reply . . . . NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3/
[I]n all actions in the nature of assumpsit . . . there shall be taxed as
attorneys' fees, to be paid by the losing party and to be included in the
sum for which execution may issue, a fee that the court determines to be
reasonable; . . . provided that this amount shall not exceed twenty-five
per cent of the judgment.
Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 607-14 (Supp. 2008).
10A reply must respond only to arguments raised in the opposition." 
Haw. R. Cir. Ct. 7.  We have previously examined a similar issue,
and ruled that the "[non-moving party] should have been given the
opportunity to respond."  Assocs. Fin. Servs. Co. of Hawaii v.
Richardson , 99 Hawai #i 446, 458, 56 P.3d 748, 760 (App. 2002). 
In Richardson, the moving party submitted an additional affidavit
introducing new evidence in its reply in support of summary
judgment.  Id. at 458, 56 P.3d at 760.  The non-moving party
filed an additional declaration in rebuttal that the trial court
declined to entertain.  Id .  We held that it was error to allow
the moving party to submit new evidence without providing the
non-moving party the opportunity to respond.  Id. at 458-59, 56
P.3d at 760-61.
In its response to Hiwalani's motion for partial
summary judgment, Wells Fargo argued that Hiwalani had not
provided evidence of damages in its motion, and that its motion
was therefore deficient.  Since Hiwalani only moved for summary
judgment on the issue of liability, the Circuit Court exceeded
the scope of Hiwalani's motion when it considered damages.  This
was an abuse of discretion as it rewarded Hiwalani's violation of
the Rules of the Circuit Court of the State of Hawai #i and
deprived Wells Fargo of a fair opportunity to respond to
Hiwalani's damages claim.  Accordingly, we vacate the Circuit
Court's award of damages.
Wells Fargo further contends that attorneys' fees and
costs were granted in error on the basis that fees and costs may
only be awarded to the prevailing party.  Indeed, attorneys' fees
is a post-judgment issue.  HRS section 607-143/ explicitly caps
the fee at twenty-five percent of the judgment, which, as a
result of our decision here, has yet to be determined. 
Therefore, the award of attorneys' fees is premature and we
vacate the award.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
11Finally, Wells Fargo argues that prejudgment interest
should not have been awarded because it did not contribute to any
undue delay.  Without reaching that argument, but for the same
reason as explained with regard to attorneys' fees, we vacate the
Circuit Court's order granting prejudgment interest. 
V. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's
December 21, 2012 Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment with
regard to liability, and vacate and remand with regard to
damages.  We further vacate the March 1, 2013 Order for
Prejudgment Interest; the March 1, 2013 Order for Fees; and the
June 3, 2013 Final Judgment, to the extent that those orders and
judgment award damages, fees, and prejudgment interest.  We
remand the case to the Circuit Court for proceedings consistent
with this memorandum opinion.
