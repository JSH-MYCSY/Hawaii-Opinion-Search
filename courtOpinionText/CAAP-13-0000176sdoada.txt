 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, McDonald's one point of error is that the 
district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai 'i's (State) complaint because it failed 
to define the term "alcohol." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 McDonald's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
McDonald contends that the State was required to
 
include in its complaint the statutory definition of "alcohol"
 provided in HRS § 291E-1 (2007).
3 McDonald contends that without
 
the definition, the complaint did not sufficiently apprise him of
 the accusations he must be prepared to meet at trial. 
This contention was rejected in State v. Turping, 
No. CAAP-13-0002957, 2015 WL 792715, (App. Feb. 25, 2015, revised
 Mar. 19, 2015), cert rejected, No. SCWC-13-0002957 (May 20,
 2015).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgement and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on 
3 HRS § 291E-1 provides in pertinent part:
 
"Alcohol" means the product of distillation of any fermented
liquid, regardless of whether rectified, whatever may be the
origin thereof, and includes ethyl alcohol, lower aliphatic
alcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl alcohol, but
not denatured or other alcohol that is considered not
 potable under the customs laws of the United States.
