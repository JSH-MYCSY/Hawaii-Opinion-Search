NO. CAAP-13-0000193
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-1675)

FUJISE, PRESIDING JUDGE, LEONARD and GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.
 
Real-Party-in-Interest/Appellant Exodus Bail Bond
 
(Exodus) appeals from an "Order Denying Motion to Set-Aside Bail
 
Forfeiture" (Order Denying Set-Aside) entered by the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)
1
 on February 14, 2013. 
Exodus contends that the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney (Prosecuting Attorney) does not have authority to represent the State of Hawai
'i (State) in bail forfeiture proceedings, and 
thus, the "Judgment And Order Of Forfeiture Of Bail Bond" (Bail

Forfeiture Judgment) entered by the circuit court pursuant to
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014), which Exodus
 sought to set aside, is void. Exodus also contends that the
 Prosecuting Attorney is not authorized to enforce the Bail
 Forfeiture Judgment.

We hold that the Prosecuting Attorney has the authority
 
to represent the State in bail forfeiture proceedings conducted
 pursuant to HRS § 804-51, and therefore, we affirm the circuit
 court's Order Denying Set-Aside. We do not address Exodus's
 second issue on appeal, whether the Prosecuting Attorney is
 authorized to enforce the Bail Forfeiture Judgment. The
 proceedings in this case did not involve the enforcement of the
 Bail Forfeiture Judgment, but rather only the issuance of the
 Bail Forfeiture Judgment and Exodus's efforts to have that
 judgment set aside under HRS § 804-51.
I. Background
 
In this case, Defendant Robert M. Miles, a.k.a. Gino
 
George (Miles), was charged with Unauthorized Entry into a Motor
 Vehicle in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 708-836.5 (2014). Exodus posted bail on behalf
 of Miles in the amount of $5,000. Miles pleaded guilty but then
 failed to appear for sentencing on September 18, 2012. 
Due to Miles's failure to appear at sentencing, the
 
circuit court issued the Bail Forfeiture Judgment on October 8,
 2012. By way of a letter sent certified mail and delivered on
 November 21, 2012, the Prosecuting Attorney gave notice to Exodus
 that Miles had failed to appear for sentencing and that, inter

 Exodus's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 in many ways, which alone raises the
potential for dismissal of the appeal and/or waiver of issues sought to beraised. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558
(1995); HRAP Rule 30 ("When the brief of an appellant is otherwise not inconformity with these rules, the appeal may be dismissed . . . ."); HRAP Rule28(b)(4) & (7). However, because we seek to address cases on the merits wherepossible, we address Exodus's arguments to the extent they are discernable.Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558. Exodus's counsel is 
cautioned to comply with HRAP Rule 28.

alia, the Bail Forfeiture Judgment had been filed. A copy of the
 
Bail Forfeiture Judgment was enclosed with the letter to Exodus.
 
On December 20, 2012, Exodus filed a timely Motion to
 
Set-Aside Bail Forfeiture pursuant to HRS § 804-51. A hearing
 was held on January 22, 2013, but because Exodus failed to
 provide this court with transcripts from the circuit court
 proceedings, the specifics of the hearing are not clear. Based
 on court minutes for this hearing, it appears that Exodus's
 counsel indicated his understanding that Miles had been
 surrendered, and the circuit court indicated it would need
 confirmation of the surrender and would deny the Motion to Set-
Aside without prejudice to Exodus re-filing by February 4, 2013. 
Subsequently, it appears from the record that Miles in fact had
 not surrendered, the circuit court did not file any order as
 indicated in the court minutes, and Exodus filed another motion
 to set aside the Bail Forfeiture Judgment on February 1, 2013.

On February 12, 2013, a further hearing was held regarding
 Exodus's motion to set aside the Bail Forfeiture Judgment and on
 February 14, 2013, the circuit court filed its Order Denying Set-
Aside.
 
II. Standard of Review
 
In addressing whether the Prosecuting Attorney is
 
authorized to represent the State in bail forfeiture proceedings,
 we consider applicable statutory and municipal charter
 provisions. Statutory interpretation is a question of law that
 
3
 Because the circuit court did not enter a written order consistent 
with the court minutes for the January 22, 2013 hearing, Exodus's motion filed
on December 20, 2012 remained the operative motion. See Glover v. Grace 
Pacific Corp., 86 Hawai' i 154, 162, 948 P.2d 575, 583 (App. 1997) ("The
court's minute order . . . was not the 'requisite written' order which could
be enforced."). Moreover, the December 20, 2012 motion was the only timely 
motion filed by Exodus under HRS § 804-51. Exodus's February 1, 2013 motionwas filed more than thirty days after Exodus received notice of the BailForfeiture Judgment on November 21, 2012, and thus the circuit court "waswithout power to consider" the untimely motion given the requirements of HRS§ 804-51. State v. Ranger Ins. Co. ex rel James Lindblad, Inc., 83 Hawai' i 
118, 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 288, 294 n.5 (1996). "HRS § 804-51 permits the filing
neither of a second motion seeking to show 'good cause why execution shouldnot issue' nor any motion after the closing of the thirty-day window." Id.;

P.3d 1131, 1137 (2007); see also State v. Flores, 88 Hawai 'i 126,

Hawai'i's bail bond forfeiture scheme, as set forth in [HRS] 
§ 804-51 . . . involves a question of law reviewable de novo.").
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there
is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or
uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity
exists.

upon the judgment[.]" HRS § 804-51.4 "[A]bsent good cause a
 
surety's failure to surrender the defendant within the thirty-day
 
search period provided by HRS § 804-51 mandates forfeiture of the
 bond." State v. Vaimili, 131 Hawai
'i 9, 17, 313 P.3d 698, 706 
(2013). In this case, Exodus does not assert that it showed good
 cause in the circuit court for why the Bail Forfeiture Judgment
 should be set aside, or that it did so in the required time-frame
 under HRS § 804-51. Instead, Exodus challenges the authority of
 the Prosecuting Attorney to act on behalf of the State in the
 bail forfeiture proceedings and contends that the Bail Forfeiture
 Judgment was void due to the involvement of the Prosecuting
 
4 HRS § 804-51 provides
 
§804-51 Procedure.  Whenever the court, in any
criminal cause, forfeits any bond or recognizance given in a
criminal cause, the court shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the State and against the principal or
principals and surety or sureties on the bond, jointly and
severally, for the full amount of the penalty thereof, and
shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately after the
expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is given
via personal service or certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the surety or sureties on the bond, of the
entry of the judgment in favor of the State, unless before
the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given to the surety or sureties on the bond of the entry of
the judgment in favor of the State, a motion or application
of the principal or principals, surety or sureties, or any
of them, showing good cause why execution should not issue
upon the judgment, is filed with the court. If the motion
 or application, after a hearing held thereon, is sustained,
the court shall vacate the judgment of forfeiture and, if
the principal surrenders or is surrendered pursuant to
section 804-14 or section 804-41, return the bond or
recognizance to the principal or surety, whoever shall have
given it, less the amount of any cost, as established at the
hearing, incurred by the State as a result of the
nonappearance of the principal or other event on the basis
of which the court forfeited the bond or recognizance. If
 the motion or application, after a hearing held thereon, is
overruled, execution shall forthwith issue and shall not be
stayed unless the order overruling the motion or application
is appealed from as in the case of a final judgment.
 
This section shall be considered to be set forth in full in
 
words and figures in, and to form a part of, and to be
included in, each and every bond or recognizance given in a
criminal cause, whether actually set forth in the bond or
recognizance, or not.

Attorney.5 Exodus argues that it is entitled to relief under 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(1) and/or 
(4).6 
Exodus's argument hinges on footnote 7 in State v. 
Camara, 81 Hawai 'i 324, 916 P.2d 1225 (1996), where the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court stated that the applicable time frame to appeal in 
a bail forfeiture case was set out in Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a), and not HRAP Rule 4(b), "because forfeiture of a bond is a civil proceeding." 81 Hawai
'i at 329 
n.7, 916 P.2d at 1230 n.7 (emphasis added). Exodus argues that, if bail forfeiture is a civil proceeding, the Department of the Attorney General (Attorney General) must represent the State, not the Prosecuting Attorney. 
The authority of the Prosecuting Attorney is established
 
by statute and county charter. HRS § 46-1.5(17) (2012)
 authorizes the counties to provide for the prosecution of
 offenses. It states that "[e]ach county shall have the power to
 provide by charter for the prosecution of all offenses and to
 prosecute for offenses against the laws of the State under the
 authority of the attorney general of the State[.]" In turn,
 Section 8-104 of the Revised Charter of the City and County of
 Honolulu (RCCCH) (Supp. 2010)
7
 establishes certain powers of the
5 Exodus's motion to set aside the bail forfeiture did not contain any
argument challenging the role of the Prosecuting Attorney. However, in its
answering brief on appeal, the State acknowledges that at the February 12,
2013 hearing, Exodus argued that bail forfeiture is a civil proceeding that
should be raised by the Attorney General and not by the Prosecuting Attorney.
We therefore address the issue.
6 It does not appear that Exodus relied on HRCP Rule 60(b) in the
circuit court. As explained infra, even if Exodus had sought relief underHRCP Rule 60(b) in the circuit court, it would have been of no avail becausethe HRCP do not apply to forfeiture of bonds. HRCP Rule 81(a)(8); Vaimili, 131 Hawai' i at 10 n.3, 13-14, 18, 313 P.3d at 699 n.3, 702-03, 707.

 Section 8-104 of the RCCCH provides in pertinent part:
 
Section 8-104. Powers, Duties and Functions–
 
1. The prosecuting attorney shall:
 
(a) Attend all courts in the city and conduct, on

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Prosecuting Attorney, including the power to "[a]ttend all courts
 
in the city and conduct, on behalf of the people, all
 prosecutions therein for offenses against the laws of the state
 and the ordinances and rules and regulations of the city[,]" and
 to "[p]rosecute offenses against the laws of the state under the
 authority of the attorney general of the state."
 
Exodus points to the statement in Marsland v. Pang , 5
 
Haw. App. 463, 472, 701 P.2d 175, 184 (1985) that "[t]he
 prosecutor's powers and functions are limited to those expressly
 accorded to his office by the statute creating it." Further,
 Exodus references HRS § 28-1 (2009) regarding the matters in
 which the Attorney General appears and which provides that "[t]he
 attorney general shall appear for the State personally or by
 deputy, in all the courts of record, in all cases criminal or
 
7(...continued)
behalf of the people, all prosecutions therein for offenses
against the laws of the state and the ordinances and rules
and regulations of the city.
 
(b) Prosecute offenses against the laws of the state
under the authority of the attorney general of the state.
 
(c) Appear in every criminal case where there is a
change of venue from the courts in the city and prosecute
the same in any jurisdiction to which the same is changed or
removed. The expense of such proceeding shall be paid by
the city.
 
(d) Institute proceedings before the district judges
for the arrest of persons charged with or reasonably
suspected of public offenses, when the prosecuting attorney
has information that any such offenses have been committed,
and for that purpose, take charge of criminal cases before
the district judges either in person or by a deputy or by
such other prosecuting officer or in such other manner as
the prosecuting attorney shall designate with approval of
the district court or in accordance with statute; draw all
indictments and attend before and give advice to the grand
jury whenever cases are presented to it for its
consideration; and investigate all matters which may
properly come before the prosecuting attorney. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the conduct of proceedings by
private counsel before courts of record under the direction
of the prosecuting attorney.

civil in which the State may be a party, or be interested[.]"8
 
In sum, Exodus contends that the Attorney General is required to
 
appear on behalf of the State once a criminal defendant fails to
 appear as required in a criminal case and there is a potential
 bail forfeiture, because the Prosecuting Attorney is not legally
 authorized to act on behalf of the State in a civil proceeding.
 
We first note that footnote 7 in Camara dealt with the
 
limited question of the time period for a surety to appeal once a
 trial court denies a motion to set aside a bail forfeiture
 judgment. Footnote 7 in Camara did not address in any way the
 question of whether the Prosecuting Attorney was authorized to
 act in bail forfeiture proceedings.
 
Importantly, in Vaimili, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
rejected an argument that, given footnote 7 in Camara, bail forfeiture is a civil proceeding requiring that a bail forfeiture judgment be subject to post-judgment review similar to any other civil judgment. 131 Hawai
'i at 13-14, 313 P.3d at 702-03. 
Rather, the court in Vaimili recognized that, despite footnote 7 in Camara, HRCP Rule 81(a)(8) expressly provides that the rules of civil procedure do not apply to proceedings for the forfeiture of bonds.
9 Vaimili, 131 Hawai 'i at 10, 13-14, 313 P.3d at 699, 
702-03. Accordingly, the court held that a motion seeking to set aside a bail forfeiture judgment could not be brought under HRCP 
8 Exodus further cites to HRS § 28-2 (2009) which provides that "[t]he
attorney general shall also enforce all bonds and other obligations in favor
of the State that may be placed in the attorney general's hands for that
purpose, by any person having the lawful custody of the papers[.]"
9 HRCP Rule 81(a)(8) provides:
 
Rule 81. Applicability.
(a) To what proceedings not applicable.  Except as
expressly otherwise provided in this Rule 81 or another ruleof court, these rules shall not apply to the followingproceedings (pursuant to specific provisions of the Hawai' i 
Revised Statues when cited below) in any circuit court:. . . . 
(8) Proceedings for the forfeiture of bonds under
section 709-51, as the same may be renumbered[.]
 
We note that HRS § 709-51, which is referenced in the rule, was
renumbered as HRS § 804-51. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 139.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule 60(b). Id. at 10, 313 P.3d at 699. Thus, Exodus's argument
 
seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b) has been previously rejected
 
by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court. 
Additionally, the court in Vaimili held that HRS § 804­
51 "controls in situations where a judgment of forfeiture has
 been entered." Id. at 17, 313 P.3d at 706. Indeed, we note that
 
Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 46(a) provides: 
Rule 46. BAIL; BOND.
 (a) Bail.  The right to bail before conviction or upon
review, the form and amount thereof, and the matters of
justification of sureties, forfeiture of bail, and exonerationof obligors and sureties shall be as provided by law. (SeeHawai'i Revised Statutes, Chapter 804.) 
(Emphases added.)
 
In line with the rulings in Vaimili, and given HRPP Rule
 
46(a), we focus on HRS § 804-51 in determining whether the
 
Prosecuting Attorney is authorized to act in bail forfeiture
 proceedings established by that statute. We start with the
 language of HRS § 804-51, which provides: 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any bond or
recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shall
immediately enter up judgment in favor of the State and against
the principal or principals and surety or sureties on the bond,
jointly and severally, for the full amount of the penalty
thereof, and shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately
after the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given . . . to the surety . . . of the entry of the judgment
in favor of the State, unless before the expiration of thirty
days from the date that notice is given to the surety . . . of
the entry of the judgment in favor of the State, a motion or
application of the . . . surety . . . showing good cause why
execution should not issue upon the judgment, is filed with the
court. . . .
 
This section shall be considered to be set forth in full in
 
words and figures in, and to form a part of, and to be included
in, each and every bond or recognizance given in a criminal
cause, whether actually set forth in the bond or recognizance,
or not.
 
(Emphases added.) By its express terms, HRS § 804-51 establishes
 
forfeiture proceedings in a "criminal cause." It is thus
 consistent that HRCP Rule 81(a)(8) provides that the rules of
 civil procedure do not apply to bail bond forfeitures.
 
The legislative history for HRS § 804-51 establishes
 
that the purpose behind the statute was to streamline the bail
 
9
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
forfeiture process and avoid the necessity of a separate action. 
The predecessor statute to HRS § 804-51 was Revised Laws of
 Hawai
'i (RLH) § 5461 (1935),10
 which was adopted in 1933 by the
Legislature of the Territory of Hawai 'i and, similar to the 
current statute, had the express language stating it applied to a
 "criminal cause." 1933 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 17, §§ 1-3. 
RLH § 5461 was enacted in order "to render unnecessary the
 institution by the Territory of Hawaii of any suit to recover on
 such bond when the same is declared forfeited." S. Stand. Comm.
 Rep. No. 71, in 1933 Senate Journal, at 363-64; see also H.
 Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 87, in 1933 House Journal, at 397 ("This
 Bill would permit judges . . . to enter up judgment . . .
 immediately upon a forfeiture being declared. . . . Under the law
 as it now exists, suit must be brought before judgment may be
 recovered on such bonds."). Thus, the legislative intent was to
 allow for the bail forfeiture judgment to be entered in the
 criminal cause without need for a separate suit.
 
10 RLH § 5461 provided:
 
FORFEITURE
 
Sec. 5461. Procedure.  Whenever the court, judge, or
magistrate in any criminal cause shall forfeit any bond or
recognizance given in a criminal cause or any peace bond,
such court, judge or magistrate shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the Territory and against the principal
or principals and surety or sureties on such bond, jointly
and severally, for the full amount of the penalty thereof,
and shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately after
the expiration of ten days from the date of the entry of the
judgment, unless before the expiration of ten days from the
entry of the judgment a motion or application of the
principal or principals, surety or sureties, or any of them,
showing good cause why execution should not issue upon the
judgment, shall be filed with the court, judge or
magistrate. If motion or application, after a hearing held
thereon, is overruled, execution shall forthwith issue and
shall not be stayed unless the order overruling the motion
or application is appealed from as in the case of a final
judgment.
This subtitle shall be considered to be set forth in
 
full in words and figures in, and to form a part of, and to
be included in, each and every bond or recognizance given in
a 
criminal cause  and in each and every peace bond, whether
actually set forth in such bond, recognizance, or peace
bond, or not.
 
(Emphases added.)

Further, in amending HRS § 804-51 in 1989, the
 
legislative history recognized the involvement of the
 
"prosecution" in the bail forfeiture process. The 1989
 amendments included a new provision that, when the court grants a
 motion vacating a bail forfeiture judgment, allows the State to
 recover costs that were incurred due to, inter alia, a
 defendant's nonappearance. 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 289, § 1 at
 643. In Standing Committee Report No. 857, the Senate Committee
 on the Judiciary stated that:
 
Your Committee sees a need to balance both the interest of the
 
bail bondsmen with that of the prosecution and the court in
order to promote fairness to all parties involved in the
process. In such regard, in the event that the [bail]
forfeiture is vacated by the court, your Committee believes
that it is appropriate that the prosecution and the court be
reimbursed for the costs incurred by them.
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 857, in 1989 Senate Journal, at 1128
 
(emphases added). The Senate Committee on the Judiciary thus
 envisioned that the "prosecution" is involved in the bail
 forfeiture process.
 
In construing HRS § 804-51, which is part of HRS Title 
38 covering procedural and supplementary provisions for criminal proceedings, we also consider laws in pari materia. "Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another." HRS § 1–16 (2009); Richardson v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai
'i 
46, 55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1202 (1994). Reading other provisions in HRS Chapter 804 in pari materia with HRS § 804-51 further evidences the legislative intent that the Prosecuting Attorney be involved in bail forfeitures. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has 
recognized that 
HRS §§ 804-1, -7.4(2), -17, and -51, . . . read in pari
materia, . . . mandate that, upon a defendant's unexcused
failure to appear for a court proceeding, (1) the defendant's
'default shall be entered,' (2) the default 'shall be evidence
of the breach of an appearance bond,' and (3) if the defendant's
 
bail bond is forfeited, 'the court shall immediately' enter a
forfeiture judgment in favor of the State and against the
defendant and his or her surety. 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State v. Ranger Ins. Co. ex rel James Lindblad, Inc., 83 Hawai 'i 
118, 122, 925 P.2d 288, 292 (1996) (brackets omitted). In turn, 
HRS § 804-7.2 (2014) expressly recognizes the role of the Prosecuting Attorney related to violations of conditions of release on bail, stating in relevant part that "[u]pon verified application by the prosecuting attorney alleging that a defendant has intentionally violated the conditions of release on bail . . . , the judicial officer named in section 804-5 shall issue a warrant directing the defendant be arrested and taken forthwith before the court [of] record for hearing." (Emphasis added.) Relatedly, a general condition of release on bail is that the person released must appear at all court hearings at which his or her presence is required. HRS § 804-7.4 (2014). The Prosecuting Attorney is thus authorized to act under HRS § 804-7.2 to ensure the presence of criminal defendants at criminal proceedings. Given the overall statutory scheme set forth in HRS Chapter 804, it follows that the Prosecuting Attorney is authorized to act in regard to bail forfeiture proceedings conducted pursuant to HRS § 804-51, because such proceedings not only involve forfeiture of a bail bond but also efforts to secure the surrender of the defendant. 
For all of these reasons, we conclude that representing 
the State in bail forfeiture proceedings established by HRS § 804-51 is within the authority granted to the Prosecuting Attorney. Such proceedings facilitate the prosecution of offenses and come within the Prosecuting Attorney's authority under HRS § 46-1.5(17) and RCCCH Section 8-104. After all, the primary purpose of bail in a criminal case is "to honor the presumption of innocence, to allow a defendant to prepare his [or her] case, and to ensure the defendant's presence in the pending proceeding."

'i at 331, 916 P.2d at 1232

B. 	The Proceedings In this Case Did Not Involve
Enforcement of the Bail Forfeiture Judgment
 
As noted earlier, we will not address Exodus's other
 
point of error alleging that the Prosecuting Attorney was not
 
authorized to enforce the Bail Forfeiture Judgment. The only
 proceedings had in the circuit court as to bail forfeiture were,
 as provided under HRS § 804-51, the circuit court's issuance of
 the Bail Forfeiture Judgment upon Defendant Miles's failure to
 appear at sentencing and Exodus's efforts to have the Bail
 Forfeiture Judgment set aside. Nothing in the proceedings dealt
 with enforcing the Bail Forfeiture Judgment, or in other words,
 ensuring that Exodus paid amounts due under the Bail Forfeiture
 Judgment.

IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we hold that the Department of
 
the Prosecuting Attorney is authorized to act in regard to bail
 forfeiture proceedings established by HRS § 804-51 within the
 context of a criminal cause. Accordingly, we affirm the "Order
 Denying Motion to Set-Aside Bail Forfeiture By Exodus Bail
 Bonds," entered on February 14, 2013, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit.
 
On the briefs:
 
Anthony T. Fujii
for Real-Party-In-Interest/
Appellant
 
Loren J. Thomas
 
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney
City and County of Honolulu
for Plaintiff/Appellee
 
11 At the end of its opening brief, Exodus makes an extraneous argument,
not set forth in any point of error, that because the Prosecuting Attorney was
informed in April 2013 (after entry of the Order Denying Set-Aside) that Mileshad been arrested and was being held in Nevada, Exodus should be affordedrelief from the Bail Forfeiture Judgment. This argument is clearly outsidethe parameters established by HRS § 804-51 because it is raised well beyondthe thirty-day window. Vaimili, 131 Hawai' i at 17, 313 P.3d at 706; Ranger 
Ins. Co., 83 Hawai' i at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d at 294 n.5.; Camara, 81 Hawai' i at 
330, 916 P.2d at 1231. Further, Exodus's conjecture that the ProsecutingAttorney may have known of Miles's whereabouts during the thirty-day period isnot supported by anything in the record.
