SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Employer-Appellant Cast & Crew Entertainment Services,
 
Inc., Insurance Carrier-Appellant Zurich American Insurance
 
Company, and Insurance Adjuster-Appellant Acclamation Insurance
 Management Services (collectively, Employer) appeal from the
 Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) Decision and
 Order (Decision and Order) filed on February 28, 2013. It is
 undisputed that Claimant-Appellee Reynold T. Kamekona (Kamekona)
 was injured at work on June 30, 2010, when he slipped and fell
 off the lift gate of a truck while loading equipment for
 Employer. The issue in this appeal is whether, in the Decision
 and Order, the LIRAB erred in concluding inter alia that there
 was a causal connection between the June 30, 2010 work injury and

a subsequent injury Kamekona sustained while washing his truck at
 
home on July 17, 2010, and that Kamekona may be entitled to
 medical care, services and supplies beyond and after July 19,
 2010.
 
Employer contends that the LIRAB erred in concluding 
that (1) Kamekona met the two-part test set forth in Diaz v. Oahu Sugar Co., 77 Hawai
'i 152, 883 P.2d 73 (1994), for a compensable 
subsequent injury under the "direct and natural result" standard; (2) Kamekona did not sustain a subsequent intervening injury on
 July 17, 2010; and (3) Kamekona may be entitled to, and Employer
 liable for, medical care, services and supplies beyond and after
 July 19, 2010. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 Employer's points of error as follows and affirm.
 
"Generally, a subsequent injury, whether an aggravation 
of the original injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable if it is the direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury." Diaz, 77 Hawai
'i at 155, 883 P.2d 
at 76 (citation and quotation marks omitted). 
The application of this standard should not be determined by
the length of time that has elapsed between the original and
the subsequent injury. Thus, the test is: (1) whether any
causal connection exists between the original and subsequent
injury; and, if so, (2) whether the cause of the subsequent
injury is attributable to some activity that would be
customary in light of the claimant's condition.
 
Id. at 156, 883 P.2d at 77. "[I]n any proceeding on a claim for 
compensation due to an alleged compensable consequence of a work-related injury, HRS ยง 386-85 [(1993)] creates a presumption in favor of the claimant that the subsequent injury is causally related to the primary injury." Korsak v. Hawaii Permanente Med. 
Grp., 94 Hawai
'i 297, 307, 12 P.3d 1238, 1248 (2000). "An 
employer can rebut the presumption by presenting substantial evidence that the injury is unrelated to employment." Davenport

v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 100 Hawai 'i 297, 311, 59 P.3d 932, 
946 (App. 2001) (quotation mark and citation omitted).
 
In this case, the LIRAB concluded that 
Applying Diaz to the facts of this case, the Board
concludes that Claimant met the two-part direct and natural
result standard. There was a causal connection between
 Claimant's original and subsequent injury and the subsequent
injury was due to a routine minor activity that was
customary in light of Claimant's condition. 
Employer contends that the LIRAB's conclusion was in
 
error because the LIRAB failed to provide any basis for a finding
 
that Kamekona met the first prong of the Diaz test and the first
 prong must be met before reaching the second prong.
1 Employer
 
contends that Kamekona does not meet the first prong of the Diaz
 test because any injury suffered on June 30, 2010 was completely
 rehabilitated by the time Kamekona injured himself washing his
 truck and developed new symptoms. 
The LIRAB's conclusion that there was a causal 
connection between the original and subsequent injury presents a mixed question of fact and law because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case and we thus review the issue under the clearly erroneous standard. See Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai
'i 402, 406, 38 
P.3d 570, 574 (2001). "When mixed questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate court must give difference to the agency's expertise and experience in the particular field. The Court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency." Id. (citation, quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The LIRAB's conclusion was not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. "It is well established that courts decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in 
1
 Employer does not contend that Kamekona could not meet the second
prong of the Diaz test, and presents no argument challenging the LIRAB's FOF
11 that washing his truck was a routine minor activity that was customary in
light of Kamekona's condition. Employer's appeal focuses only on the first
prong.

favor of the administrative findings, or to review the agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field." Moi v. State, Dep't of 
Pub. Safety, 118 Hawai
'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 756 (App. 2008) 
(citation and block format omitted). 
In its Decision and Order, the LIRAB found that
 
Kamekona suffered "a work injury to his low back, among other
 areas," while at work on June 30, 2010. The LIRAB noted the
 testimony of Kamekona that even though he returned to work on
 July 16, 2010, he was not pain free at the time, but "continued
 to have back pain, which went down into his leg." Kamekona
 testified that his pain increased when he did things like tie his
 shoes, and that after washing his truck on July 17, 2010, he felt
 increased low back pain that was similar to the pain he would
 feel while tying his shoes. 
This testimony is, for the most part, consistent with
 
Dr. Howard Keller's (Dr. Keller) notes from his series of
 examinations with Kamekona that were considered by the LIRAB. 
But, as Employer points out, Dr. Keller's notes indicate Kamekona
 had no radiating pain during his visits on July 10 and 13, 2010. 
Dr. Keller noted on July 7, 2010 that Kamekona initially
 presented with low back muscle tightness, walked with a haltering
 gait, and that the reflexes and straight leg tests were positive. 
Dr. Keller diagnosed an acute L.S. strain. Over two subsequent
 visits on July 10 and 13, 2010, Dr. Keller noted improvement in
 Kamekona, including full range of motion, a normal gait, no
 radiating pain, and approval of a return to full duty on July 17,
 
2
2010. However, according to Dr. Keller's notes,  Kamekona
 
experienced more pain in his lower back with radiating pain into

 
legs after washing his truck at home on July 17, 2010. In
 
2
 Dr. Keller's notes provide that Kamekona exacerbated his injury while
washing his truck on July 20, 2010. However, the LIRAB found that Kamekona
was actually washing his truck on July 17, 2010.

Dr. Keller's opinion this was an exacerbation of the June 30,
 2010 work injury. 
The LIRAB credited this evidence over the report of
 
Dr. Clifford Lau (Dr. Lau), who prepared his report at the
 request of Employer. Dr. Lau concluded that Kamekona aggravated
 a preexisting degenerative back injury on two separate occasions,
 once when he fell off the truck while at work on June 30, 2010,
 and then again while washing his truck on July 17, 2010, having
 rehabilitated in the time between the two incidents. However,
 Dr. Lau does not explain how the June 30, 2010 injury did not
 have a causal effect on the July 17, 2010 aggravation, especially
 when there is nothing in his report to demonstrate any recent
 back pain prior to June 30, 2010. We defer to the LIRAB's
 weighing of the evidence. From our review of the record, it was
 not clearly erroneous for the LIRAB to conclude that Kamekona's
 July 17, 2010 injury was casually connected to the prior June 30,
 2010 injury.
 
Therefore, the LIRAB did not err in concluding that
 
Kamekona may be entitled to, and Employer liable for, medical
 care, services and supplies beyond and after July 19, 2010.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decision and Order filed
 
on February 28, 2013, by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 Appeals Board is affirmed.
