STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
EVANS NATHAN GUYTON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 2DCW-12-0000362)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge and Reifurth, J.,
with Leonard, J., dissenting.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Evans Nathan Guyton (Guyton)

 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order,
 
entered on February 22, 2013, in the District Court of the Second
 Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court).
1 After a bench
 
trial, the District Court found Guyton guilty of Violation of
 Restraining Order or Injunction Against Harassment (Violating an
 Injunction), pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 604-10.5
 (Supp. 2014), and sentenced him to pay a $500 fine.
 
On appeal, Guyton argues that the District Court
 
wrongly convicted him of Violating an Injunction based on
 insufficient evidence. Related to this argument is his
 contention that Conclusion of Law (COL) 7 in the District Court's
 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law, is clearly erroneous. 
Guyton asks this court to reverse his conviction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Richard B. Berman presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Guyton's points of error as follows:
 
Guyton's conviction is based on sufficient evidence, 
and COL 7 is not wrong because (1) the District Court convicted Guyton based on his conduct of entering or visiting Petitioner-Appellee John Varel's (Varel's) "residence"; and (2) there is substantial evidence showing Guyton (a) knew that "residence," as used in the injunction, encompassed Varel's entire property, see Schwab v. Ariyoshi, 58 Haw. 25, 35, 564 P.2d 135, 141 (1977), and (b) knowingly entered or visited Varel's property. See HRS 
ยง 702-206 (2014); State v. Birdsall, 88 Hawai
'i 1, 8, 960 P.2d 
729, 736 (1998). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order, entered on February 22, 2013, in
 the District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, is
 affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
