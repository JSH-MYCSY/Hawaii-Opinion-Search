RAMONA HUSSEY, M. KA' IMILA NICHOLSON,
NATALIA ANTONIA HUSSEY-BURDICK, BRENT S. DUPUIS,
MARVIN D. HESKETT, and JOEL L. MERCHANT,
Petitioners-Appellants,
v.
 
CALVIN K.Y. SAY, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.
 NO. 12-1-0736)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack jurisdiction over the appeal by Petitioners-Appellants
 
Ramona Hussey, M. Kaimila Nicholson, Natalia Antonia Hussey-
Burdick, Brent Dupuis, Marvin D. Heskett, and Joel L. Merchant
 (Appellants). 
The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction
 
"[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when
 appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2011). 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The law provides that "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil 
matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 
120, 869 P.2d at 1339. 
Appellants appeal from an Order Granting Respondent
 
Calvin K.Y. Say's Motion to Dismiss Petition for Writ of Quo
 Warranto, filed on March 11, 2013
1. The record on appeal does
 
not contain a separate final judgment, as required by Jenkins.
 
Therefore,

 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.
