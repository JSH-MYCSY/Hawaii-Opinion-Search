APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0430)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Alii Security 
Systems, Inc.'s (Appellant Alii Security Systems), appeal from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's February 20, 2013 judgment because the February 20, 2013 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawai
'i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012), Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments,
 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in
 the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641­1(c). "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate
 document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced
to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and
 against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 
 
Jenkins
, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
A judgment that does not either expressly enter judgment on the 
claims or expressly dismiss the claims requires an appellate court to search the often voluminous record on appeal for the dispositive antecedent orders to determine and confirm whether and how the circuit court resolved each of the claims. As the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained, "we should not make such 
searches necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n appeal from any 
judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added).
 
The February 20, 2013 judgment neither expressly enters 
judgment on nor expressly dismisses any claims. Instead, the 
February 20, 2013 judgment merely enters judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Professional Security Consultants and Professional Security Consultants, Inc., and against Appellant Alii Security Systems for costs, alone, without expressly resolving a single claim. An award of attorneys' fees or costs is not, by itself, independently appealable, because it "is not a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." Fujimoto v. 
Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 (2001) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, for example, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has "note[d] that [a] 
circuit court's order awarding attorneys' fees and costs may not be certified as a final judgment, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), because such an order is not a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). "The entry of judgment and taxation of costs are separate legal acts." CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., Inc., 95 
Hawai'i 301, 307, 22 P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) (citation, internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). "Absent entry of an appealable final judgment on the claims . . . [to which an award of attorneys' fees and costs relates], the award of attorneys' fees and costs is . . . not appealable." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 
Hawai'i at 123, 19 P.3d at 706; CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., 
Inc., 95 Hawai' i at 306, 22 P.3d at 102 ("Similarly, the 
September 23, 1999 Order [awarding only attorneys' fees] and the February 3, 2000 Judgment [awarding only attorneys' fees] are not appealable, and we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review them."). 
Because the February 20, 2013 judgment neither
 
expressly enters judgment on nor expressly dismisses the claims
 in this case, the February 20, 2013 judgment does not satisfy the
 requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641­1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins. Absent the entry
 of an appealable final judgment, Appellant Alii Security Systems'
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 
appellate court case number CAAP-13-0000220. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0000220 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
