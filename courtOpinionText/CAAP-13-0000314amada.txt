APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0415)

 
ORDER OF CORRECTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J.)

 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Memorandum Opinion filed
 
March 21, 2016 in the above case is corrected as follows: 
On page 14, in the third line of the second complete
 
paragraph the words "in Hou" at the end of the first sentence
 
should be removed and a period should be placed after the word
 "agencies" so that as corrected the sentence shall read: "The
 supreme court in Hou recently discussed the importance of due
 process protections for parties in adjudicatory proceedings
 before administrative agencies."
 
On page 15, in the last sentence of the second complete
 
paragraph the word "cases" should be "case" so that as corrected
 the sentence shall read: "Effectively, however, the LUC did not
 accept any more testimony on the contested case."
 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
