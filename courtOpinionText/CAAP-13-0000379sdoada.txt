IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SATSON SATANO, Defendant-Appellant, and
AMOI ELIAS, Defendant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-0738)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Satson Satano (Satano) appeals from
 
the March 4, 2013 "Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence"
 
for the crime of Theft in the Second Degree, a violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-831(1)(a) (2014) entered by
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).
1
 
On appeal, Satano argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
when it instructed the jury on Theft in the Second Degree because
 Theft in the Second Degree pursuant to HRS § 708-831(1)(a) is not
 a lesser included offense of Robbery in the Second Degree
 pursuant to HRS § 708-841(1)(a).
 
After a careful review of the point of error raised,
 
the arguments made by the parties, the record on appeal and the
 applicable legal authority, we resolve Satano's point on appeal
 as follows and affirm.

Robbery in the Second Degree (Robbery 2),  as charged
here, required the prosecution prove that "[Satano], while in the
course of committing theft, did use force against the person of
 Roy Roman, a person who was present, with the intent to overcome
 Roy Roman's physical resistance or physical power of
 resistance[.]"
 

 
Theft in the Second Degree (Theft 2),3
 as instructed by
the Circuit Court, required the prosecution to prove that
 "Satano[] obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the
 property of Roy Roman; and . . . did so from the person of Roy
 Roman; and . . . did so with the intent to deprive Roy Roman of
 the property."
 
Satano argues that Theft 2 is not a lesser included
 
offense of Robbery 2 under HRS § 701-109(4)(a) or (c) (2014).

2 "Robbery 2" refers to Robbery in the Second Degree pursuant to HRS
§ 708-841(1)(a) (2014) which provides,
 
(1) A person commits the offense of robbery in the second
degree if, in the course of committing theft or non-
consensual taking of a motor vehicle:
 
(a)	 The person uses force against the person of
anyone present with the intent to overcome that
person's physical resistance or physical power
of resistance[.] 
3 "Theft 2" refers to Theft in the Second Degree pursuant to HRS
§ 708-831(1)(a), which provides,
 
(1) A person commits the offense of theft in the second
degree if the person commits theft:
 
(a) Of property from the person of another[.]

(4) A defendant may be convicted of an offense
included in an offense charged in the indictment or the
information. An offense is so included when:
 
(a) 	It is established by proof of the same or less
than all the facts required to establish the
commission of the offense charged; or
 
(b) 	It consists of an attempt to commit the offense
charged or to commit an offense otherwise
included therein; or

We conclude that Theft 2 is a lesser included offense of Robbery
 
2 under HRS §701-109(4)(c).
 
Under "[s]ubsection (c) . . . there may be some 
dissimilarity in the facts necessary to prove the lesser offense, but the end result is the same." State v. Matautia, 81 Hawai
'i 
76, 83, 912 P.2d 573, 580 (App. 1996) (quoting State v. Alston, 75 Haw. 517, 536, 865 P.2d 157, 167 (1994)). The factors to consider include "(1) the degree of culpability; (2) the degree or risk of injury; and (3) the end result." Alston, 75 Haw. at 
536, 865 P.2d at 167. 
a. The degree of culpability. As Satano
 
acknowledges, the state of mind for both offenses is
 "intentionally." Under the Hawaii Penal Code, the term
 "culpability" equates to the state of mind required by each
 offense. See Commentary on HRS § 702-204 (2014) (State of Mind
 
Required) ("Clear analysis requires that the various distinct
 ingredients of an offense be separately recognized and that
 culpability be required as to each."). Therefore, the first
 factor does not disqualify Theft 2 as a lesser included offense.
 
b. The degree or risk of injury. According to the
 
Commentary on § 701-109(4),
5
 
paragraph (c) is concerned with cases in which the included
offense involves a less serious injury or risk of injury to
the same person, property, or public interest or a lesser
kind of culpability. Paragraph (c) differs from paragraph
(a) in that, although the included offense must produce the
same result as the inclusive offense, there may be some
dissimilarity in the facts necessary to prove the offense.
Therefore (a) would not strictly apply and (c) is needed to
fill the gap.
 
Both offenses under consideration here are included in
 
Chapter 708, "Offenses Against Property Rights," making
 
protection of property the main focus of each offense. Both
 offenses are designed to prevent the risk of bodily injury. 
4(...continued)
 
respect that a less serious injury or risk of

injury to the same person, property, or public
interest or a different state of mind indicating
lesser degree of culpability suffices to
establish its commission.

the code's provisions. HRS § 701-105 (2014).

In the case of the offense of Robbery 2, this is
 
implicit in the use of force element. Concern over the potential
 
for harm to the person is also implicit in the requirement, in
 Theft 2, that the taking be from "the person." The Commentary on
 HRS §§ 708-830 to 708-833 (2014) (footnote omitted) observes, 
Degrees of theft.  The Code is in accord with the
 
Model Penal Code and other recent revisions in grading the
theft offenses according to the mode of the theft, the
object involved, and the value of the property or services
stolen. The gradation is based on the theory that theft
from the person, or of a firearm, or of property or services
of relatively high value presents greater social harm and
that the actor in such cases may require greater
rehabilitation efforts.
 
The commentary to the Model Penal Code further notes that a theft
 
from the person would be subject to higher penalties, despite
 lower value of the property taken, because it involves "special
 potentialities for physical violence or alarm associated with the
 taking[.]" Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Part II
 Commentaries, vol. 2, § 223.1(2) at 148 (1980). 
In short, while the elements that distinguish both
 
offenses from an ordinary theft are related to the risk of
 personal injury, because Robbery 2 requires actual force, whereas
 Theft 2 requires only that the property be taken from the person,
 the latter makes the level of risk involved less than that
 involved in Robbery 2. Accord Commonwealth v. Monroe, 678 A.2d
 
1208, 1213 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996) (citing Model Penal Code and
 Commentaries, Part II Commentaries, vol. 2, § 223.1(2) at 148
 (1980)); see also Commonwealth v. Williams, 567 A.2d 709, 713
 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989). 
While the use of force to take an object not attached
 
to the person of the victim could constitute Robbery 2 without
 constituting Theft 2, under the facts of the instant case, the
 attendant circumstances required by Theft 2 are included in
 Robbery 2. Roman testified that the bag he was carrying was
 grabbed by Satano after Satano and Elias pounded him down. 
Therefore the facts alleged supported (1) the charge of Robbery 2
 because force was used to overcome Roman's resistance to his bag
 being taken from his person; and (2) the included offense of
 Theft 2 because the bag was taken from Roman's person. This is

precisely the sort of "need[] to fill the gap" anticipated by the
 
Commentary on subsection (4)(c). Commentary on § 701-109.
 
c. End result. In both offenses, the result of the
 
prohibited conduct is the taking of property. Contrary to
 Satano's characterization of Robbery 2, that offense is not
 primarily concerned with violence. For robbery, use of force is
 a method, not the end result. As the title to HRS Chapter 708
 indicates, the end result of both robbery and theft is an offense
 against property rights. 
Therefore, based on the foregoing, we affirm the
 
March 4, 2013 "Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence" 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
