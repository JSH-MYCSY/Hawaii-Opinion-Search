IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DEAN T. MINAMI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR NO. 12-1-1968)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Dean T. Minami ("Minami") appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry,
 
filed on March 21, 2013, in the Family Court of the First Circuit
 ("Family Court").
1/ Minami was convicted by a jury of Abuse of
 
Family or Household Members, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") § 709-906(1).
2/ Minami was sentenced to two
 
days in jail and one year of probation, and assessed $130 in
 various fees. 
1/ The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided. 
2/ HRS § 709-906(1) provides: 
Abuse of family or household members; penalty. (1) It
shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to
physically abuse a family or household member . . . .
 
For purposes of this section, “family or household

member” means spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, former
spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, persons who have a
child in common, parents, children, persons related by
consanguinity, and persons jointly residing or formerly
residing in the same dwelling unit. 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 709-906(1) (Supp. 2012).
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Minami contends that the Family Court erred
 
in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal and the jury
 
wrongly found him guilty of violating HRS § 709-906 because there
 was insufficient evidence to prove that he caused the complaining
 witness ("CW"), his wife, to suffer bodily injury. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry
 and resolve Minami's points as follows:
 
To prove "physical abuse" under HRS § 709-906(1), the 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i ("State") must show that the 
defendant caused "bodily injury" to another person. See HRS § 
707-700 (1993); State v. Nomura, 79 Hawai 'i 413, 416, 903 P.2d 
718, 721 (App. 1995) ("[I]t is evident that to 'physically abuse' someone means to maltreat in such a manner as to cause injury, hurt, or damage to that person's body.") "'Bodily injury' means physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707-700. 
Minami asserts that even when viewed in the light most
 
favorable to the prosecution, "a reasonable mind could not have
 concluded that [he] was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt," and
 that his conviction "violated [his] due process right not to be
 convicted except on proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every
 element of the offense charged." We disagree.
 
We begin by observing that "[t]he test on appeal is not 
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 33, 960 
P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai 'i 128, 
145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 (1997)). 
Substantial evidence as to every material element of the
offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support a conclusion. Under such a review, we
give full play to the right of the fact finder to determine
credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable
inferences of fact.
 
State v. Timoteo, 87 Hawai 'i 108, 112–13, 952 P.2d 865, 869–70 
(1997) (citing State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai 'i 472, 481, 927 P.2d 1355, 
2

1364 (1996)). 
Honolulu Police Department Officer Nolan Chang 
testified that, upon his arrival at the residence, he observed 
that the side of CW's face was red. Moreover, CW's statement taken at the time of the incident reflected that Minami had slapped her in the face, punched her in the head, and kicked her in the leg.
3/ CW testified that she felt pain after being 
slapped. Taking into account Officer Chang's testimony and CW's statement, the jury could reasonably infer that Minami caused physical pain, and thus bodily injury, to CW. See State v. 
Tomas, 84 Hawai
'i 253, 264, 933 P.2d 90, 101 (App. 1997) 
overruled on other grounds by State v. Gonzales, 91 Hawai 'i 446, 
984 P.2d 1272 (App. 1999) (the testimony of the injured person suffices as evidence to prove bodily injury). 
Inconsistencies between CW's trial testimony and her 
written statement do not diminish the sufficiency of the evidence. State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 138-39, 913 P.2d 57, 
64-65 (1996) (holding that there was substantial evidence to convict, despite inconsistencies in the victim's testimony). It was within the jury's prerogative to believe CW's written statement, taken shortly after the incident, and to disbelieve her oral testimony in court because it is for the fact-finder to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of fact. A jury may also accept or reject a witness’s testimony in whole or in part. See Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i at 139, 913 P.2d at 
65. Here, the jury may have accepted CW's testimony as to having
 
suffered pain from being slapped, while rejecting that part of
 her testimony limiting the scope of the incident.
 
The State provided evidence for all three material
 
elements of the offense of Abuse of Family or Household Members:
 (1) On September 8, 2012, Minami physically abused CW; (2) at the
 time, Minami and CW were family or household members; and (3)
 Minami acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly as to each
 of the foregoing elements. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 709-906(1). 
3/
 At trial, CW testified that she did not remember being hit, apart
from the slap. She also testified that she loved Minami and did not want to
 
see him get into any trouble.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
prosecution, State v. Keawe, 107 Hawai 'i 1, 4, 108 P.3d 304, 307 
(2005), the evidence presented was sufficient to lead a reasonable mind to conclude that Minami was guilty of the offense of Abuse of Family or Household Members. Thus, the Family Court properly denied Minami's motions for judgment of acquittal. 
Since sufficient evidence was presented to support the 
conviction, Minami's right to due process was not violated. Cf. 
State v. Puaio, 78 Hawai
'i 185, 191, 891 P.2d 272, 278 (1995) ("A 
conviction based on insufficient evidence of any element of the offense charged is a violation of due process . . . .") (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979)). 
Therefore,
 The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of
 
Entry, filed on March 21, 2013 in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit, is affirmed.
