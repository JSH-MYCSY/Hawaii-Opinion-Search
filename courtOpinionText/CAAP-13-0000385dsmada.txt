NO. CAAP-13-0000385
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
CAROLYN MIZUKAMI, Plaintiff-Appellant v.
DON QUIJOTE (USA) CO., LTD. AND DTRIC INSURANCE COMPANY, LTD.,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-3273-12)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Plaintiff-Appellant Carolyn Mizukami's
 
(Appellant Carolyn Mizukami) appeal from the Honorable Virginia
 
L. Crandall's February 28, 2013 "Order Sustaining Objection of
 Defendants Don Quijote (USA) Co., Ltd.[,] and DTRIC Insurance
 Company, Ltd.[,] to Appearance of Glenn Mizukami as Attorney in
 Fact for Plaintiff Carolyn Mizukami" (the February 28, 2013
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interlocutory disqualification order), it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-13­0000385 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012) and Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
holds that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
The February 28, 2013 interlocutory disqualification 
order is not a final judgment, but, instead, it is an interlocutory order that, in effect, disqualifies Glenn Mizukami from appearing on behalf of Appellant Carolyn Mizukami before the circuit court or in any pleadings in this case. The February 28, 2013 interlocutory disqualification order is not certified for interlocutory appellate review pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). Therefore, the February 28, 2013 interlocutory disqualification order is not appealable unless it qualifies under the collateral order doctrine. As the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained, 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
an order granting or denying a motion to disqualify a party’s 
counsel 
d[oes] not determine the merits of the case, and it can be
final for the purpose of appeal only if it comes within the
collateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp.,
337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225, 93 L.Ed. 1528
(1949), embracing "that small class which finally determine
claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights
asserted in the action, too important to be denied review
and too independent of the cause itself to require that
appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is
adjudicated."
 
Gomes v. Kauwe’s Heirs, 52 Haw. 126, 127, 472 P.2d 119, 120
 
(1970) (emphasis added; holding than an order denying a motion to
 disqualify counsel is not appealable as a matter of right); Chuck
 v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 61 Haw. 552, 556-57, 606 P.2d 1320, 1323-24 (1980) (holding that an order granting a motion to disqualify counsel is not appealable as a matter of right). "In order to fall within the narrow ambit of the collateral order doctrine, the order must [1] conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawai
'i 157, 161, 883 P.2d 78, 82 (1994) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted; original brackets). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that the 
collateral order doctrine does not apply to an order denying a motion to disqualify counsel: 
In this case, we do not think that appellants will
suffer immediate and irreparable injury by a denial of their
appeal. If the circuit court erred, that question may be
raised on appeal from judgment on the merits. . . . . To
 allow appeals from all orders denying disqualification of
attorneys will invite delay by piecemeal appeals.

(citations omitted); see also Wong v. Fong, 60 Haw. 601, 604, 593
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 386, 389 (1979). Likewise, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has 
also specifically held that the collateral order doctrine does
 
not apply to an order granting a motion to disqualify counsel,
 because, among other things, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i would 
prefer that the aggrieved party either (1) seek permission from
 the circuit court for an interlocutory appeal by way of HRS
 § 641-1(b) so that the circuit court can decide whether to incur
 the added expense and disruptive delay of an interlocutory appeal
 or (2) petition the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i for a writ of 
mandamus:
 
We have already held, however, that orders denying
disqualification are interlocutory and hence not appealable
as of right under the rule, Gomes v. Heirs of Kauwe, 52 Haw.
126, 472 P.2d 119 (1970), and while a distinction could be
drawn between an order denying and an order granting
disqualification, we are not of the view that appeal from
the latter order should be accorded as a matter of right.
The Cohen rule was intended by the Supreme Court to apply
only to those cases which were too important to be denied
review through the appellate process, and we are reluctant,
at least insofar as it concerns attorney disqualifications,
to expand the doctrine much beyond that which necessitated
its formulation in the first instance.
 
We recognize, of course, the importance of a party's
right to be represented by his chosen counsel, and we are
not unmindful of the inconvenience that may be visited upon
him by reason of his counsel's disqualification. But the
 party whose counsel is disqualified is not without some
means of judicial review. He may move the trial court for
permission to take an interlocutory appeal. HRS s 641-1. 
And while the motion would be addressed to the sound
 discretion of the trial court, the process does enable the
trial court to perform the important and necessary function
of isolating cases meriting appellate review from those that
would result in unnecessary expense and delay. Automatic
 appeal, as of right, in every case of counsel
disqualification would preclude the utilization of this
salutary procedural screening device.
 
The trial court, being intimately familiar with the
nature and course of the litigation, is in the best possible
position to determine whether special circumstances exist to
warrant interlocutory appellate review of the attorney's
disqualification. Failing in his efforts to obtain
interlocutory review, the party affected by the
disqualification may still petition this court for a writ of
mandamus to direct the trial court to set aside its order of
 disqualification. Cf. Wong v. Fong, 60 Haw. 601, 593 P.2d
386 (1979).

Chuck v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, 61 Haw. at 
556-57, 606 P.2d at 1323-24 (footnotes omitted); see also Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawai
'i 410, 414, 917 P.2d 1284, 
1288 (1996) ("This court has determined that a petition for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is an appropriate vehicle for reviewing an order of disqualification." (Citation omitted)). Under the holding in Chuck v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, the collateral order doctrine does not apply to the February 28, 2013 interlocutory disqualification order. 
Thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the
 
February 28, 2013 interlocutory disqualification order, and
 Appellant Carolyn Mizukami's appeal is premature. Without
 appellate jurisdiction, the only appropriate remedy is to dismiss
 appellate court case number CAAP-13-0000385.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
 lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.
