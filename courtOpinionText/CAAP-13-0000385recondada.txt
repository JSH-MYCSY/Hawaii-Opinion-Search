Upon review of (1) the May 16, 2013 order dismissing 
Plaintiff-Appellant Carolyn Mizukami's (Appellant Carolyn 
Mizukami) appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0000385 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Appellant Carolyn Mizukami's May 28, 2013 motion for reconsideration of the May 16, 2013 dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears that Appellant Carolyn Mizukami does not appeal from any appealable order or judgment and we did not overlook or misapprehend any NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
points of law or fact when we entered the May 16, 2013 dismissal
 
order. Therefore, Appellant Carolyn Mizukami's May 28, 2013 HRAP
 Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the May 16, 2013 dismissal
 order lacks merit. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Carolyn Mizukami's
 
May 28, 2013 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the
 May 16, 2013 dismissal order is denied.
