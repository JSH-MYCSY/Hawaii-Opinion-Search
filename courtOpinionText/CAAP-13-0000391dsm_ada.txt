IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
GALINA OGEONE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DENTIST W RUTH YANG, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-3278)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack jurisdiction over the appeal by Plaintiff-Appellant Galina
 
Ogeone (Appellant). 
The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction
 
"[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when
 appeals are allowed by law[.]" 
HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2011). 
The law provides that "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil

matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit 
. . . courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011). 
Appellant appeals from an Order Granting Defendant
 
Dentist Ruth W. Yang's Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default of
 February 25, 2013 (Filed March 19, 2013), filed on April 5,
 2013.
1 This order is not a final order, judgment, or decree from
 
which an appeal can be taken.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
