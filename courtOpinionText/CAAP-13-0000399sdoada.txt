BRANDON LEE TADAO HAYATA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRCT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1P1120007935)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Brandon Lee Tadao Hayata (Hayata)
 
was convicted of harassment, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 711-1106(1)(b) (Supp. 2013).1 After a bench
 
trial, the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court)2
 
found Hayata guilty as charged, and it sentenced Hayata to pay a
 fine of $600 and fees of $30. 
1HRS ยง 711-1106(1)(b) provides:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that person:
 
. . .
 
(b)	 Insults, taunts, or challenges another person in a
manner likely to provoke an immediate violent response
or that would cause the other person to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
to the recipient or another or damage to the property
of the recipient or another[.]

Hayata appeals from the Judgment filed in the District 
Court on January 14, 2013.3 On appeal, Hayata contends that: (1) 
the District Court's advisements regarding his right to testify 
and his right not to testify pursuant to State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000), and Tachibana v. State, 79 
Hawai'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), were deficient; and (2) there 
was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. As explained below, we vacate Hayata's conviction because the District Court's Tachibana colloquy was deficient, and we remand the case for a new trial. 
I. 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) concedes 
that the District Court's Tachibana colloquy was deficient and that the District Court's error in failing to conduct an adequate Tachibana colloquy was not harmless error. We agree with the State's concession of error. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 236 & 
n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 & n.7; State v. Han, 130 Hawai 'i 83, 90-95, 
306 P.3d 128, 135-40 (2013). We therefore vacate Hayata's conviction. Because we vacate Hayata's conviction based on his Tachibana claim, we need not address his Lewis claim. 
We reject Hayata's claim that there was insufficient 
evidence to support his conviction. When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient. See 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai
'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998). 
The complaining witness (CW) testified that she had been in a romantic "dating" relationship with Hayata for several years, but their relationship had terminated. After the relationship ended, Hayata continued to contact the CW, calling her sometimes 50 times a day, text messaging her 75 times a day, and emailing her 275 times. With respect to the charged incident, Hayata confronted the CW in a parking structure as she was returning to work with a co-worker. The CW testified that Hayata repeatedly

moved to block her path so she could not leave; that he got in
 
her face, swore at her, and angrily asked why she did not return
 his calls and why she would end their relationship; that he told
 her that she was lucky her co-workers were there because he
 "would slam [her] against that car" if her co-workers were not
 present; and that this statement made the CW feel threatened
 because she believed him.  Hayata kept the CW from returning to
 
work for 20 or 25 minutes, and only left the scene after sheriffs
 
intervened to ask what was going on and if there was a problem. 
We conclude that there was substantial evidence to 
support Hayata's conviction. In contending otherwise, Hayata argues that conflicts between the CW's testimony and other evidence showed that the CW was not credible. However, "[i]t is the province of the [trier of fact], not the appellate courts, to determine the credibility of witnesses[,]" State v. Souza, 119 Hawai
'i 60, 72-73, 193 P.3d 1260, 1272-73 (App. 2008) (block 
quote format and citations omitted), and we "give full play to the province of the trier of fact to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw rational inferences from the facts." State v. Lioen, 106 Hawai
'i 123, 130, 102 P.3d 367, 374 (App. 
2004). We conclude that the District Court did not err in relying on the CW's testimony. 
II.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the District
 
Court's Judgment and we remand the case for a new trial.
