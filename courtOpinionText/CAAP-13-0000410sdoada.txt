v.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-04895)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Elias A.M. Parker (Parker) appeals
 
from the Judgment entered on March 19, 2003, in the District
 
Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Parker was
 
convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
1/ The Honorable Michael A. Marr presided.
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2013).2 We affirm Parker's conviction and
 
sentence.
 
A police officer pulled Parker over after observing him
 
run a red light. The officer subsequently arrested Parker for
 
OVUII. After placing Parker under arrest, the officer read to
 Parker a form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While Operating a
 Vehicle Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent Form). 
Parker agreed to take a breath test and refused a blood test. 
Parker's breath test showed that he had a breath alcohol
 concentration of .162 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath 
-- a concentration that exceeded the legal limit. Parker moved
 to suppress the results of his breath test, and the District
 Court denied his motion. 
On appeal, Parker challenges the District Court's
 
denial of his motion to suppress. Parker argues that because the
 police failed to give him Miranda warnings before reading the
 Implied Consent Form to him and obtaining his decision on
 testing, the results of his breath test should have been
 suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation. Parker further
 argues that the results of his breath test should have been
 suppressed because: (1) the police violated his statutory right
 to an attorney under HRS § 803-9 (1993) and misinformed him of
 his statutory right to an attorney; (2) the police misinformed
 him of the sanctions for refusing to submit to testing; and (3)
 based on Missouri v. McNeely, --- U.S. ---, 133 S. Ct. 1552 
2/ HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
. . .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath[.]
 
Parker's complaint charged him with OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) (Supp. 2013) and/or (a)(3), and alleged that he was subject tosentencing as a first offender in accordance with HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp.2013). The District Court granted Parker's motion to dismiss the HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) portion of the charge, and Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i only
proceeded to trial on the alleged HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) violation.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2013), the police violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment
 
in obtaining the results of his breath test. 
We recently rejected the same arguments in State v. 
Won, No. CAAP-12-0000858, --- Hawai 'i ---, --- P.3d ---, 2014 WL 
1270615 (Hawai 'i App. Mar. 28, 2014) (as amended on May 2, 2014). 
Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Parker's motion to suppress, and we affirm Parker's conviction and sentence under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) and (b)(1).

3/Although the District Court dismissed the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion
of the OVUII charge, see footnote 2, supra, the typed portion of the District
Court's Judgment under "Violation Section" and its files erroneously indicate
that Parker was convicted of violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3).
We direct the District Court to file a corrected judgment that clearly
reflects that Parker was only convicted of violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), as a
first offender under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1).
