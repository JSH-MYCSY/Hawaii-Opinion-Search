IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RAYMOND THORP, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-0781)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Raymond M. Thorp (Thorp) appeals
 
from the March 18, 2013 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, for
 
Theft in the Second Degree in violation of HRS § 708-831 (Supp.
 2013), which was entered by the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit (Circuit Court).

Thorp raises two points of error on appeal, contending
 
that: (1) the Circuit Court erred when it denied Thorp's motion
 for judgment of acquittal based on the State's alleged failure to
 prove the value of the stolen items exceeded $300; and (2) the
 Circuit Court abused its discretion when it sentenced Thorp to
 five years of imprisonment despite the facts of the case and his
 family circumstances.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Judge Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Thorp's points of error as follows:
 
(1) In order to prove second-degree theft, the State
 
must establish the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt
 that the defendant intended to:
2 (1) obtain or exert
 
unauthorized control over the property of another; (2) deprive
 the other of the property; and (3) deprive the other of property
 that exceeds $300 in value.
3 Value "means the market value of
 
the property or services at the time and place of the offense, or
 the replacement cost if the market value of the property or
 services cannot be determined[.]" HRS § 708-801(1) (Supp. 2013).
 
In the instant case, Mark Nowicki (Nowicki) testified
 
that each stolen pipe had a wholesale price of $150 and a retail
 price of $300. Nowicki based his opinion on the costs of
 materials, labor, and overhead, as well as on his experience
 selling similar pipes in the course of his business. Christopher
 Schoney (Schoney) testified that he estimated that the pipes were
 
worth several hundred dollars. The State also introduced the
 
Oahu Glass Tubes wholesale catalog, which listed prices for the
 "Heady Beaker" pipe at $150 wholesale and $300 retail. 
Additionally, the State presented evidence that Thorp
 
sold two of the stolen Oahu Glass Tubes water pipes to Russell
 Taft (Taft) at Pipe Dreams on May 10, 2012 for $160. During a
 
phone conversation on May 15, 2012, Thorp and Taft also agreed on
 
the same price for the additional two pipes that Thorp would
 bring in on May 16, 2014.
 
We reject Thorp's argument that the State was required to
 
call an expert appraiser to establish value. Thorp's argument

 HRS § 701–114 (1993); see also State v. Mitchell, 88 Hawai' i 216,
222, 965 P.2d 149, 155 (App. 1998).

 HRS § 708-830(1) (Supp. 2013) defines "theft" as "[o]btain[ing] or
exert[ing] unauthorized control over the property of another with intent to
deprive the other of the property." Under HRS § 708-831(1)(b) (Supp. 2013),the value of the property must "excee[d] $300" in order for the theft toconstitute second-degree theft. See also Mitchell, 88 Hawai' i at 223, 965
P.2d at 156 (holding that the State must prove that the defendant intended tosteal property exceeding $300 in value to establish guilt for second degreetheft).

 State v. Kong,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that his failure to have consummated the second sale of the
stolen pipes is relevant to their value is without merit. We
 conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to support
 Thorp's conviction.
 
 
(2) A trial court is "duty-bound to consider" the
 
factors set forth in HRS § 706-606
4
 before imposing a sentence. 
State v. Sinagoga, 81 Hawai 'i 421, 428, 918 P.2d 228, 235 (App. 
1996), overruled on other grounds by State v. Veikoso, 102
 Hawai
'i 219, 74 P.3d 575 (2003). However, "[t]he fact that a 
court does not orally address every factor stated in HRS § 706­606 at the time of sentencing does not mean the court failed to
 consider those factors." Id. "'The weight to be given the
 
factors . . . is a matter generally left to the discretion of the
 sentencing court, taking into consideration the circumstances of
 each case.'"  131 Hawai
'i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 
727 (2013) (quoting State v. Akana, 10 Haw. App. 381, 386, 876
 P.2d 1331, 1334 (1994)). An appellant must show that the
 sentencing court abused its discretion. State v. Kahapea, 111
 
Hawai
'i 267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 451 (2006). 
While Thorp does not expressly contend that the court
 
failed to consider the sentencing factors set forth in HRS

 
4
 HRS § 706-606 (1993) provides:
 
§ 706-606 Factors to be considered in imposing a
sentence.  The court, in determining the particular sentence
to be imposed, shall consider:
(1)	 The nature and circumstances of the offense and
 
the history and characteristics of the
defendant;
(2)	 The need for the sentence imposed:
(a)	 To reflect the seriousness of the offense,
to promote respect for law, and to provide
just punishment for the offense;
(b)	 To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct;
(c)	 To protect the public from further crimes
of the defendant; and
(d)	 To provide the defendant with needed
educational or vocational training,
medical care, or other correctional
treatment in the most effective manner;
(3)	 The kinds of sentences available; and
(4)	 The need to avoid unwarranted sentence
 disparities among defendants with similar
records who have been found guilty of similar
conduct.

§ 706-606, he argues that the sentence of five years was
 
"unwarranted and unduly harsh under the circumstances of this
 case." The record demonstrates that the Circuit Court carefully
 considered Thorp's arguments, including his family circumstances,
 as well as his criminal history, history of substance and alcohol
 abuse, limited employment, and other issues. It appears that the
 Circuit Court weighed all of these factors before imposing
 Thorp's sentence. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not
 abuse its discretion in sentencing Thorp to a maximum of five
 years of imprisonment.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's March 18, 2013
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence is affirmed.
