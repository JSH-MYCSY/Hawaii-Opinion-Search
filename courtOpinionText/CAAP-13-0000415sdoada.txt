IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JAMES K. LIBERO, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0002; CR. NO. 98-0697)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant James K. Libero appeals from the
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying
 
Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody, filed on April 10, 2013 in the Circuit
 Court of the Second Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1
 
On October 4, 2000, Libero was convicted of Attempted 
Murder in the Second Degree, Assault in the First Degree, and Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree.  On direct appeal, 
we affirmed Libero's convictions for Attempted Murder in the 
Second Degree and Assault in the First Degree but reversed his conviction for Attempted Sexual Assault in the First Degree. State v. Libero, 103 Hawai
'i 490, 83 P.3d 753 (App. 2003), cert. 
denied, 103 Hawai 'i 479, 83 P.3d 742 (2004). 
Between August 23, 2001, and January 16, 2013, Libero
 
filed seven petitions for relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the
 Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure. The first petition was denied
 because his direct appeal was still pending before the appellate

court. The subsequent six petitions were also denied. 
On February 20, 2013, Libero filed a Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 
from Custody ("Eighth Petition"). On April 10, 2013, the Circuit
 Court issued the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 Judgment Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody which denied
 Libero's Eighth Petition.
 
On appeal, Libero asserts the same claims as he did in
 
his Eighth Petition: (1) the Circuit Court should reverse the
 First Degree Assault conviction because there was no matching DNA
 from a blood stain or hair on the kiawe branch; (2) the Circuit
 Court failed to instruct the jury on the merger of the charges
 for Attempted Murder in the Second Degree and Assault in the
 First Degree; (3) there was no probable cause for his arrest and
 he was not given a Miranda warning; and (4) ineffective
 assistance of counsel, who failed to object to irrelevant and
 prejudicial trial testimony by a police detective.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Libero's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1 & 2) Libero's first and second points of error were
 
previously raised and ruled upon in his sixth petition. 
Therefore, relief is not available. Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(a)(3)
 ("Rule 40 proceedings shall not be available and relief
 thereunder shall not be granted where the issues sought to be
 raised have been previously ruled upon or were waived.")
 
(3) Libero failed to prove the existence of
 
extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the
 issue in his direct appeal and seven prior petitions for relief. 
Therefore, relief is not available. Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(a)(3).
 
(4) Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were
 
raised and ruled upon in Libero's second, fourth, fifth, and
 seventh petitions. Therefore, relief is not available. Haw. R.
 Pen. P. 40(a)(3).
 
To the extent that Libero's appeal can be construed to

assert any other point of error on appeal, Libero failed to prove
 
the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his
 failure to raise the issue in seven prior petitions for relief. 
Therefore, relief is not available. Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(a)(3).
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying Petition to Vacate, Set
 Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody,
 filed on April 10, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit is affirmed.
