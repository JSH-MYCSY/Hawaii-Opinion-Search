2Durda and against Ion, and is limited to Ion's challenge to the
dismissal with prejudice of its third-party complaint against
Third-Party Defendant-Appellee Gena Costales.  Ion asks this
court to set-aside the portion of the March 21, 2013 Order and
the February 13, 2013 Order pertaining to the dismissal of the
third-party complaint against Costales with prejudice, and that
the case be remanded to another trial court judge.  We vacate the
February 13, 2013 Order, and vacate in part the February 25, 2013
Final Judgment and the March 21, 2013 Order.  We remand for
further proceedings consistent with this memorandum opinion.
I. BACKGROUND
In July 2009, Durda was interested in purchasing an
Arasys Inch Loss System ("Machine") from Ion.  Ion put Durda in
contact with its sales representative, Costales.  Ion and
Costales had an agreement that Costales would be paid a
commission for her work in facilitating the sale of the Machine
to Durda.  Durda entered into an agreement with Ion to purchase
the Machine for $20,300, and for Costales to hand-deliver and
train Durda on how to use it.  Durda paid Ion for the Machine,
and Ion shipped the Machine to Costales in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Costales disputed the amount of commission Ion was supposed to
pay her, and subsequently did not deliver the Machine to Durda. 
Durda requested a refund from Ion, but Ion refused.  Ion told
Durda that it was her responsibility to retrieve the Machine
from, and to file criminal charges against, Costales.
On February 2, 2010, Durda filed a complaint against
Ion for breach of contract and five other causes of action.  Ion
filed an amended answer to Durda's complaint, and filed a third-
party complaint against Costales on May 8, 2011.  Ion personally
served Costales with a copy of the summons and third-party
complaint on September 19, 2011.  On November 9, 2011, Durda
filed a Notice of Trial Setting Status Conference, which she
served on Ion, but which was not served on Costales.  The Circuit
Court filed a Trial Setting Status Conference Order of
November 28, 2011, which set the trial date for May 7, 2012.  The
order was signed by Durda and Ion, but not Costales presumablyNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3/Ion failed to include transcripts in the record on appeal for any
of the hearings or the trial held by the Circuit Court.  Transcripts, however,
are not always necessary for appellate review, if "it is possible to determine
that the court erred without recourse to the transcript." Thomas-Yukimura v.
Yukimura, 130 Hawai# i 1, 10 n.19, 304 P.3d 1182, 1191 n.19 (2013).  
3because Costales was not represented at the trial setting
conference.   After a motion made by Ion, the clerk of the court
granted an entry of default against Costales on April 19, 2012.
On May 7, 2012, the Circuit Court conducted a one-day
bench trial on Durda's complaint and Ion's third-party complaint
against Costales.3/  The Circuit Court encouraged the parties to
work out a settlement and the matter was taken under advisement. 
Costales did not receive notice of the trial setting, and thus
did not appear at trial to challenge Ion's third-party claim for
damages.  On June 19, 2012, a minute order was issued ordering
the parties to submit their proposed findings of fact and
conclusions of law no later than July 3, 2012 since neither party
had informed the court of any settlement. 
On July 11, 2012, the Circuit Court issued its Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order ("FOFs/COLs") that
determined, in part, that Ion breached the contract formed
between Durda and Ion by failing to deliver the Machine to Durda.
On July 23, 2012, subsequent to the conclusion of the trial and
the issuance of the Circuit Court's FOFs/COLs, Ion filed both a
motion for default judgment against Costales, in which Ion asked
for all damages requested in the third-party complaint, and a
motion for reconsideration from the July 11, 2012 FOFs/COLs.  On
August 29, 2012, the Circuit Court entered an order denying Ion's
July 23, 2012 motion for reconsideration. 
Although no final judgment was filed, on September 26,
2012, Ion filed a notice of appeal to this court from the August
29, 2012 order denying Ion's motion for reconsideration.  On
November 9, 2012, this court dismissed the initial appeal for
lack of jurisdiction.  On October 24, 2012, Ion filed a Notice of
Withdrawal of Motion for Entry of Default Judgment.  On
November 7, 2012, Costales filed an answer to Ion's third-party
complaint. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4On November 9, 2012, Durda filed a Motion to Dismiss
Third-Party Complaint and Entry of Final Judgment ("Motion to
Dismiss") in which she sought either entry of an order dismissing
the third-party complaint or an order certifying the FOF/COL as a
final judgment under Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP")
Rule 54(b).  At a hearing on December 7, 2012, Ion sought a
continuance of the court's consideration of the motion because
they were working with Costales to settle the third-party
complaint.  Ion and Costales placed contingent settlement terms
regarding the third-party complaint on the record, agreeing to a
resolution no later than December 21, 2012.  On December 21,
2012, Ion requested and the Circuit Court granted a time
extension to depose Costales.  On February 6, 2013, after
receiving no update from Ion, the Circuit Court notified the
parties that it would rule on Durda's Motion to Dismiss on
February 12, 2013.  On February 6, 2013, by telephone, Ion
represented to the Court that any issues regarding the third-
party complaint would be resolved by February 11, 2012.  On
February 11, 2012, Ion again requested an extension from the
Circuit Court.
On February 13, 2013, the Circuit Court issued its
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Third-Party
Complaint and Entry of Final Judgment."  In it, the Circuit Court
determined that Ion failed to ask for a ruling on its third-party
complaint, which the Circuit Court considered as a "failure to
prosecute, warranting a dismissal of the Third-Party Complaint."
The Circuit Court issued its Final Judgment on February 25, 2013,
in which it dismissed the third-party complaint against Costales
with prejudice ("February 25, 2013 Final Judgment"). 
On March 7, 2013, Ion filed a motion for
reconsideration, requesting that the Circuit Court "set aside the
order dismissing the Defendant's Third-Party Complaint against
Gena Costales, with prejudice," or, alternatively, to amend the
order to dismiss the third-party complaint without prejudice.  
The Circuit Court then issued its March 21, 2013 Order denying
Ion's motion for reconsideration.  Accordingly, Ion's April 22,
2013 Notice of Appeal was timely filed.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4/Ion's opening brief fails to adhere to the requirements of Hawai# i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b).  Ion's opening brief does
not contain any references to the record.  Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(3) (an
opening brief requires "record references supporting each statement of fact or
mention of court or agency proceedings"); Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn &
Stifel, 117 Hawai# i 92, 114 n.23, 176 P.3d 91, 113 n.23 (2008) ("[T]his court
is not obligated to sift through the voluminous record to verify an
appellant's inadequately documented contentions." (quoting In re Guardianship
of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai# i 211, 234-35, 151 P.3d 692, 715-16 (2007))). 
Further, Ion attached documents to their opening brief that are not part of
the record on appeal.  This court disregards appendices that are not part of
the record, unless otherwise specified by the rule. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(10)
("Anything that is not part of the record shall not be appended to the brief,
except as provided in this Rule."); see Au Hoy v. Au Hoy, No. 30486, 2013 WL
2650568, *1 n.2 (Hawai# i App. June 12, 2013) ("Insofar as any appendices are
not part of the record, they are disregarded.").  Nevertheless, noncompliance
with HRAP Rule 28 does not always result in dismissal of the claims, and
"[t]his court . . . has consistently adhered to the policy of affording
litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, where
possible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai# i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982,
989-90 (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai# i 383, 386, 885 P.2d
361, 364 1994)).  Counsel for Ion is advised that future noncompliance with
the rule may result in sanctions pursuant to HRAP Rule 51.
5II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(b)
"The review of a dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(b) is for
abuse of discretion, and absent deliberate delay, contumacious
conduct or actual prejudice[,] an order of dismissal cannot be
affirmed.  In re Blaisdell , 125 Hawai #i 44, 48, 252 P.3d 63, 67
(2011) (quoting  Jungblut v. Nishio , No. 29997, 2010 WL 3866029,
at *5 (Haw. App. Sept. 30, 2010)).  "[T]o constitute an abuse of
discretion a court must have clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to
the substantial detriment of a party litigant."  Id. (quoting
Amfac, Inc. v. Wakiki Beachcomber, Inv. Co. , 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839
P.2d 10, 26-27 (1992)).
III. DISCUSSION
Ion asserts that the Circuit Court "committed
reversible error in dismissing the complaint with prejudice."4/
Ion further asserts that there is evidence that shows that they
made persistent efforts to move the case forward, and that it was
Costales who was dilatory.  Ion relies on In re Blaisdell and
cases from other jurisdictions to support its argument.  Ion's
argument has merit. 
HRCP Rule 41(b) provides:NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6(1) For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to
comply with these rules or any order of the court, a defendant
may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against
it.
(2) For Failure to prosecute or comply with these
rules or any order of the court, the court may sua sponte
dismiss an action or any claim with written notice to the
parties.  Such dismissal may be set aside and the action or
claim reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown
upon motion duly filed not later than 10 days from the date of
the order of dismissal.
(3) Unless the court in its order for dismissal
otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and
any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for
failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an
adjudication upon the merits.
Haw. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held that
"absent deliberate delay, contumacious conduct or actual
prejudice[,] an order of dismissal cannot be affirmed." 
Blaisdell , 125 Hawai #i at 48, 252 P.3d at 67.  "A dismissal of
complaint is such a severe sanction, that it is to be used only
in extreme circumstances when there is a 'clear record of delay
or contumacious conduct . . . and where lesser sanctions would
not serve the interests of justice.'"  Ellis v. Harland
Bartholomew and Assocs., 1 Haw. App. 420, 427, 620 P.2d 744, 749
(1980) (quoting Bagalay v. Lahaina Restoration Found., 60 Haw.
125, 132, 588 P.2d 416, 422 (1978)); cf. Hawaii Auto. Retail
Gasoline Dealers Ass'n v. Brodie , 2 Haw. App. 99, 101, 626 P.2d
1173, 1175 (1981) (affirming the trial court's dismissal under
HRCP Rule 41(b), noting that "whatever action taken by appellant
was in the artful dodging of diligent prosecution"). 
Here, the record does not show either deliberate delay
or actual prejudice to the third-party defendant.  Ion argues
that "it is very clear from the efforts of [Ion]'s counsel, . . .
as evidence[d] by the persistent efforts he made on behalf of his
client to move the case forward[.]"  Ion further asserts that it
was Costales who was dilatory, "requiring continuous and repeated
changes and extensions in the discovery schedule."  While this
court will not consider Ion's improperly-attached documents, a
review of the record on appeal does not show deliberate delay on
Ion's part.  In fact, the record demonstrates that Ion made
efforts to settle with Costales, and both parties placedNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7contingent settlement terms for the third-party complaint on the
record on December 7, 2012.  See Compass Dev., Inc. v. Blevins,
10 Haw. App. 388, 401-02, 876 P.2d 1335, 1341-42 (1994) (vacating
and remanding a HRCP Rule 41(b) dismissal for want of prosecution
because plaintiff engaged in settlement conferences, attempted to
settle the matter out of court, and only needed to choose a trial
date); but see Brodie, 2 Haw. App. at 101, 626 P.2d at 1175
(upholding an HRCP Rule 41(b) dismissal where plaintiff failed to
depose defendant until the eve of trial and continued to dodge
prosecution); Ellis, 1 Haw. App. at 428, 620 P.2d at 749
(affirming an HRCP Rule 41(b) dismissal where the record showed
numerous motions to delay and postpone trial and affidavits
stating plaintiff's unavailability for many proceedings). 
Additionally, neither Durda nor Costales submitted an answering
brief claiming that they suffered actual prejudice in this case. 
Without deliberate delay on Ion's part, there is no basis to
presume appellees suffered actual prejudice.  See  Blaisdell , 125
Hawai#i at 49-50, 252 P.3d at 68-69.  Accordingly, the record
does not show deliberate delay or actual prejudice.
Further, the record is void of contumacious conduct. 
"'Contumacious conduct' has been defined by this court as
'[w]illfully stubborn and disobedient conduct.'" Id. at 50, 252
P.3d at 69 (quoting Shasteen Inc. v. Hilton Hawaiian Village
Joint Venture , 79 Hawai #i 103, 107 n.7, 899 P.2d 386, 390 n.7
(1995)).  Here, the record fails to demonstrate that Ion refused
to comply with a court order, that it was even issued an order,
or that Ion conducted itself in a defiant manner.  Id. 
Accordingly, there is no indication in the record that Ion
committed contumacious conduct warranting dismissal with
prejudice.
 Because the record does not reveal that: (1) Ion
deliberately delayed the prosecution of this case; (2) appellees
suffered actual prejudice; or (3) Ion's actions could be
considered contumacious conduct, the Circuit Court "should have
considered and explained why a lesser sanction, such as a
dismissal without prejudice was insufficient to serve the
interests of justice."  Id.  at 50-51, 252 P.3d at 69-70 (citingNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
8to Schilling v. Walworth Cty. Park & Planning Comm'n, 805 F.2d
272, 275 (7th Cir. 1986)).  Here, the Circuit Court did not
provide any explanation for its decision other than to cite Ion's
failure to request a ruling on the third-party complaint. 
Furthermore, although the Circuit Court demonstrated patience and
afforded Ion an opportunity to complete the settlement that they
claimed repeatedly was imminent, a dismissal with prejudice is
inconsistent with the Hawai# i Supreme Court's "policy of
affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on
the merits, where possible[.]"  Id . at 51, 252 P.3d at 70
(quoting Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai# i 81,
85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 111-12 (1999)).  While the Circuit Court
reasonably credited Durda's claim of entitlement to a final
judgment, the court did not explain why HRCP Rule 54(b)
certification was not sufficient.  Therefore, the Circuit Court
abused its discretion when it dismissed Ion's third-party
complaint with prejudice. 
IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the February 13, 2013
Order issued by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  We also
vacate the February 25, 2013 Final Judgment and the March 21,
2013 Order to the extent that they pertain to the dismissal of
the third-party complaint with prejudice and affirm the
February 25, 2013 Final Judgment and the March 21, 2013 Order in
all other respects.  We remand for further proceedings consistent
with this memorandum opinion.
