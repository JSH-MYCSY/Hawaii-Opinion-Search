NO. CAAP-13-0000429
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
DISCOVER BANK, a Delaware Corporation, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADFORD W. ADAMS and EI RAYNA K. ADAMS, Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC09-1-009133)
 
ORDER
 
(1) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
 
(2) DENYING AS MOOT ANY AND ALL PENDING MOTIONS
IN APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-13–000146
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendants-Appellants Bradford
 
W. Adams and Eirayna K. Adams (the Adams Appellants) have
 asserted from the Honorable Hilary B. Gangnes's following two
 interlocutory orders:
 
(1) a March 25, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' "Rule 59(e) or 60(b) Motion to Review
3/18/13 Hearing 'Set-Aside Default, and
Continuance' & Grant 3/8/13 Counter-Claimed
Judgment against Plaintiffs"; and
  
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). In the instant case, the district court has
 
not yet entered a final order or final judgment that ends this
 litigation by adjudicating all claims and leaves nothing further
 to be adjudicated. In fact, as recently as April 15, 2013, the
 district court entered a written order setting aside an earlier
 default that the district court had apparently orally announced
 (as reflected in district court minutes, only) against the Adams

(2) an April 1, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion for sanctions against
Plaintiff-Appellee Discover Bank, a Delaware
Corporation.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2012) authorizes an appeal from a final order or final judgment
 
of a district court.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished
. . .
 
. When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai' i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
 
omitted; emphases added). 
The separate judgment document rule
 
under Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76
 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994) is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.

Appellants. Furthermore, the district court minutes indicate 
this case is still pending before the district court, and that the district court has scheduled a status conference for October 14, 2013. Absent a final order or final judgment that resolves all claims in this case, we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-1(a) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142.
 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2012), neither of the two appealed interlocutory orders satisfies the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent a final order or final judgment that adjudicates
 
all of the parties' claims, the Adams Appellants' appeal is
 premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0000429 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.

IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0000429 are denied as
 
moot.
