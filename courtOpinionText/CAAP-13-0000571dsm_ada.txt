ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
 
LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION WITHOUT PREJUDICE
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears Taxpayers-
Appellants Travelocity.com, L.P., Site59.com LLC, Hotwire, Inc.,
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hotels.com, L.P., Orbitz, LLC, Internetwork Publishing Corp.,
 
Trip Network, Inc., Travelweb LLC, Expedia, Inc., and
 Priceline.com, Inc. (Appellants), appeal from the following
 interlocutory orders entered by the tax appeal court in the
 consolidated tax appeal cases in Tax Appeal No. 11-1-0021:
 
(1) Order Granting in Part and Continuing in Part
Director of Taxation, State of Hawai' i’s Motion 
for Partial Summary Judgment on General Excise Tax
Assessments, filed February 8, 2013; and 
(2) Order Denying Appellants’ Motion for
Reconsideration of the Order Granting in Part andContinuing in Part Director of Taxation, State ofHawai'i’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on
General Excise Tax Assessments, Entered February8, 2013, filed April 1, 2013. 
As explained below, the court lacks jurisdiction because the tax
 
appeal court has not yet entered its final decision in the
 consolidated tax appeal cases.
 
HRS § 232-19 (Supp. 2012) authorizes an aggrieved party
 
to appeal to this court from a tax appeal court’s "decision":
 
Any taxpayer or county aggrieved or the assessor may
appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, from the decision of the tax appeal court by
filing a written notice of appeal with the tax appeal court
and depositing therewith the costs of appeal within thirty
days after the filing of the decision. The appeal shall be
considered and treated for all purposes as a general appeal
and shall bring up for determination all questions of fact
and all questions of law, including constitutional
questions, involved in the appeal. A notice of appeal may
be amended at any time up to the final determination of the
tax liability by the last court from which an appeal may be
taken. The appellate court shall enter a judgment in
conformity with its opinion or decision.
All such appeals shall be speedily disposed of and, in
the hearing and disposition thereof, shall be given
preference over other litigation in the discretion of the
court.
 
(Emphasis added). Although HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012)
 
and Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
require a circuit court to reduce all dispositive orders in a
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  civil case to a separate judgment to perfect an aggrieved party’s 
right to assert an appeal, Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) 
(Jenkins), the separate judgment rule does not apply to appeals from the tax appeal court, Alford v. City & County of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 21-22, 122 P.3d 809, 816-17 (2005) (Alford); 
Lewis v. Kawafuchi, 108 Hawai' i 69, 73, 116 P.3d 711, 715 (App. 
2005). Nonetheless, “consistent with the general rule of finality governing appeals, the appealable ‘decision of the tax appeal court,’ HRS § 232-19, should be the decision that finally decides all issues in the tax appeal.” Alford, 109 Hawai' i at 
22, 122 P.3d at 817 (emphasis added). Consequently, in an appeal from consolidated tax appeal cases, the tax appeal court must finally decide all issues in each consolidated case before any party may obtain appellate review of any tax appeal court decision. Id. at 23, 122 P.3d at 818. In circumstances where, 
as here, the separate judgment rule in HRCP Rule 58 and holding in Jenkins are inapplicable, the Hawai' i Supreme Court explained 
that, 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from
[HRCP] 54(b) that the orders collectively constitute a final
judgment and . . . entry of the last of the series of orders
gives finality and appealability to all.
 
S. Utsunomiya Enter., Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480,
494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal quotation
marks & emphases omitted).
 
We recently dismissed a related appeal filed by 
Respondent-Appellee Director of Taxation, State of Hawai' i, for 
lack of jurisdiction because the tax appeal court has not yet 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered a final decision that resolves all remaining issues in 
these consolidated tax appeal cases. In re Travelocity.com, LP, CAAP-13-0000146, Dkt. No. 154 (Jun. 7, 2013 order dismissing appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction without prejudice). We noted the tax appeal court indicated in its March 15, 2013 minute order that it has not yet entered its final decision through a judgment that will resolve the last remaining issues in the consolidated tax appeals, such as penalties relating to general excise tax assessments. Moreover, in the “Order Denying in Part and Granting in Part Appellants’ Motion to Stay Entry of Remaining Orders and Judgment, Filed on April 4, 2013,” filed May 22, 2013, the tax appeal court clarified that its prior orders were executory and interlocutory, and not final. The tax appeal court further explained its intent to enter in the future an order and judgment that together would constitute its final decision with respect to Appellants’ liability for general excise tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and non-liability for transient accommodations taxes; and that “no appealable final decision shall exist with respect to the General Excise Tax or the Transient Accommodations Tax prior to that time.” We determined that absent the tax appeal court’s final decision that resolves all remaining issues in these consolidated tax appeal cases, we lacked jurisdiction over that appeal. The same result should obtain here. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0000571 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction without
 prejudice to an aggrieved party asserting a timely appeal from

the tax appeal court’s final decision in the underlying
 
consolidated tax appeal cases.
