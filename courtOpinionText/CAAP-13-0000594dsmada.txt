NO. CAAP-13-0000594
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
DAVID BROWN, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, et al., Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1193)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court 
does not have jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant David Brown’s
appeal from a first circuit court judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee State of Hawai' i, and two other circuit court 
rulings (judgment and other rulings hereinafter collectively referenced as “Appealed Rulings”), because the Appealed Rulings are not independently appealable, and the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final judgment on all claims and parties pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP).  
HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2010) authorizes appeals
 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the
 
rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment
 shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Basedon this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of
 Hawai'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has
 been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties
 

 
pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming
 
& Wright
, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i) identify
the claims for which it is entered, and (ii) dismiss any claims
not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. (emphases added).
 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on (date),
judgment in the mount of $___ is hereby entered in favor of
Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I through IV of
the complaint." A statement that declares "there are no other
 outstanding claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court
 intends that claims other than those listed in the judgment
language should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
When interpreting the requirements for a judgment under HRCP Rule
 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face all of
the issues in the case, the burden of searching the often
voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions of
jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the parties nor
counsel have a right to cast upon this court the burden of
searching a voluminous record for evidence of finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
A judgment that does not specifically identify the claims on
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which it enters judgment requires an appellate court to search 
the often voluminous record on appeal in order to determine the specific claims on which judgment is entered, and, as the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has explained, "we should not make such searches 
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58." Id. "[A]n appeal from any 
judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (emphasis added). 
The June 4, 2013 judgment resolved the claims against 
the State of Hawai' i, but did not explicitly address the claims 
against Melanie Chinen and other parties, and as such, it does not, on its face, resolve claims of all the parties. Although the June 4, 2013 judgment contained language that “[t]here are no claims, parties nor issues remaining in the case[,]” as Jenkins explained, such a statement is not a judgment, and the judgment should explicitly dismiss other claims individually or by reference to all other claims. Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119-20, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338-39. 
Where the June 4, 2013 judgment is not a final
 
judgment, the Appealed Rulings are not eligible for appellate
 
1
review  unless they qualify for appealability under one of the
three exceptions to the HRCP Rule 58 separate judgment rule:
 (1) the collateral order doctrine, (2) the Forgay doctrine, or
 
1 “ An appeal from a final judgment ‘brings up for review all
interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with
issues in the case.’” Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892,
902 (2005), quoting Pioneer Mill Co., Ltd. v. Ward, 34 Haw. 686, 694 (1938).

(3) HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2012).
 
The Appealed Rulings do not satisfy the requirements 
for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order 
doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Therefore, the Appealed Rulings are not appealable. 
Absent an appealable separate judgment, Appellant
 
Brown's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over appellate court case number CAAP-13-0000594. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
CAAP-13-0000594 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
