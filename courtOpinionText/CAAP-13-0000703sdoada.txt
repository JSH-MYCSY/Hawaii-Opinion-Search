appeals from the (1) April 10, 2013 "Order Granting Defendant

(Hawaiian) cross-appeals from the circuit court's August 10, 2012
 
"Order Denying Without Prejudice Defendant Hawaiian Airlines
 Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment."
 
Wong, a retired Hawaiian Airlines pilot, contends the
 
circuit court reversibly erred by: 
(1)
 granting Hawaiian's motions for summary judgment by
 
orders dated March 18, 2013 and April 10, 2013;

(2) granting Hawaiian's May 6, 2013 motion for taxation
 
of costs by order dated June 14, 2013;
 
(3) violating Wong's constitutional due process and
 
equal protection rights; and
 
(4) dismissing all of Wong's claims against Hawaiian in
 
the June 7, 2013 Final Judgment.
 
Hawaiian contends the circuit court erred by denying in
 
part Hawaiian's first motion for summary judgment:
 
(1) on the grounds that there were "genuine issues of
 
material fact as to [Wong's] damages in the form of increased
 
Medical Part B premiums that he is incurring[;]" and
 
(2) failing to conclude that Wong lacked standing to
 
bring the case because: (a) Wong's alleged damages were too
 
speculative; and (b) he was not a "consumer" for purposes of his
 
unfair or deceptive acts or practice claim (UDAP claim) under
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 480. See HRS § 480-2(d)
 
(2008 Repl.) ("No person other than a consumer, the attorney
 general or the director of the office of consumer protection may
 
bring an action based upon unfair or deceptive acts or practices
 
declared unlawful by this section.").
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the parties' respective points of error as follows. 
We first address Hawaiian's contention regarding 
standing because resolution of that issue could preclude our 
jurisdiction to determine the merits of this case. See 
Kaho
'ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai 'i 302, 324, 162 P.3d 696, 718 
(2007) ("[A]n appellate court has jurisdiction to resolve 
questions regarding standing, even if that determination 
ultimately precludes jurisdiction over the merits.") (internal 
quotation mark and citations omitted). Hawaiian contends Wong 
lacks standing because: he failed to show a present or future 
need for redundant coverage under Medicare Part B; he would have 
to pay the Medicare Part B enrollment penalty only if the Social 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Security Administration (SSA) failed to waive the penalty; and he
 
failed to enroll in Medicare Part B, thus incurring the penalty,
 
at the outset of the case.
 
To establish the requisite interest for standing to 
bring the case, the plaintiff must show that she or he: 
"(1) has . . . suffered an actual or threatened injury as a 
result of the defendant's conduct; (2) . . . [has an] injury 
fairly traceable to the defendant's actions; and (3) . . . [that] 
a favorable decision would likely provide relief for plaintiff's 
injury." Sierra Club v. Hawai 'i Tourism Auth. ex rel. Bd. of 
Directors, 100 Hawai 'i 242, 250, 59 P.3d 877, 885 (2002) 
(citations, ellipsis, and footnote omitted). 
Under the first element of a test for standing, the 
question is not whether the lack of redundant insurance coverage 
caused Wong to suffer an actual or threatened injury, but whether 
Wong's liability for late enrollment penalties constituted an 
injury. The penalties constituted "economic harm" particular to 
Wong sufficient to confer standing. See Application of Hawaiian 
Elec. Co., Inc., 56 Haw. 260, 265 n.1, 535 P.2d 1102, 1106 n.1 (1975). Wong's current liability for those penalties is "fairly 
traceable" to alleged misrepresentations by Hawaiian's 
representative that Wong could elect the Medicare Part B coverage 
at a later date and without penalty. See Sierra Club v. Dep't. 
of Transp., 115 Hawai
'i 299, 324, 167 P.3d 292, 317 (2007). 
Hawaiian's contention that Wong lacked standing because
 
he was not paying Medicare Part B enrollment penalties at the
 outset of the case lacks merit. At all pertinent times, Wong's
 
enrollment was subject to penalties. Hawaiian further contends
 
that Wong's delay in seeking to enroll in Medicare Part B
 
undermined his claim that he actually desired such coverage. 
Wong's complaint, however, is based on the assertion that he
 
would have enrolled in Medicare Part B prior to the period
 
subject to penalty payments. Wong's desire for Medicare Part B
 
coverage outweighed his recalcitrance towards paying the
 
penalties.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The possibility that the SSA could have waived the
 
penalties in Wong's case did not render Wong's injury merely
 
speculative. As of January 31, 2012, Wong began paying
 
approximately $100 a month in late enrollment penalties,
 
constituting an "injury" allegedly caused by Hawaiian's
 
representative providing misinformation that was "present and
 
very real, not a mere possibility in the remote future." Pierce
 
v. Soc'y of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268
 U.S. 510, 536 (1925). We conclude the circuit court did not err
 
by finding Wong had standing to raise his claims. 
Wong contends the circuit court erred in ruling that
 
his negligence and negligent representation claims were preempted
 
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29
 
U.S.C.A. §§ 1001-1461, as amended (ERISA). However, the circuit
 
court did not rule that ERISA preempted Wong's negligence claims. 
It ruled that his claims did not and could not rely on duties
 
imposed by ERISA because if they did, his claims would be
 
preempted.
 
Wong's negligence claims were preempted by the Railway
 
Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C.A. § 151 et seq. RLA established a
 
mandatory arbitration process for "major" disputes concerning
 
rates of pay, rules or working conditions relating to the
 
formation of collective bargaining agreements (CBA) or efforts to
 
secure them; and "minor" disputes "growing out of grievances or
 
out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering
 
rates of pay, rules, or working conditions." 45 U.S.C. § 151a. 
RLA preempts claims arising from labor disputes, but "does not
 
[preempt] causes of action to enforce rights that are independent
 
of the CBA." Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246,
 
256 (1994); accord Saridakis v. United Airlines, 166 F.3d 1272,
 1277-78 (9th Cir. 1999). The parties do not dispute that the
 
Pilots' Agreement constitutes a CBA between Hawaiian and its
 
pilots and retired pilots. Tort claims are preempted "if they
 
can be resolved by referring to the terms of the [CBA]." 
4
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Saridakis, 166 F.3d 1272, 1278 (internal quotation marks and
 
citation omitted).
 
The preemption standard under the RLA "is virtually 
identical to the [preemption] standard the [Hawai 'i Supreme] 
Court employs in cases involving § 301 of the [Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185(a)]." Norris, 512 
U.S. at 260.
2 Under § 301 of the LMRA, a state tort claim is
 
preempted if the claim depends on interpretation of a CBA; and a
 
claim depends on such an interpretation "if the duty to the
 
employee of which the tort is a violation is created by a
 
collective-bargaining agreement and without existence independent
 
of the agreement." United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO-CLC v.
 
Rawson, 495 U.S. 362, 369 (1990). A duty to an employee exists
 independently of a CBA where defendants were "accused of acting
 
in a way that might violate the duty of reasonable care owed to
 
every person in society." Rawson, 495 U.S. at 371. 
Hawaiian's alleged negligence occurred when its
 
representative was providing information to Wong about Medicare
 
Part B retirement benefits. Under Rawson, Wong's negligence
 
claims are preempted by the RLA because Hawaiian's duty to act
 
with reasonable care to ensure that its representatives do not
 
provide misinformation about retirement benefits arose from its
 
duties under the Hawaiian Airlines 2010 Pilots Agreement (Pilots'
 
Agreement). 
The circuit court did not err by dismissing Wong's UDAP
 
claim under HRS Chapter 480 on the basis that "the alleged unfair
 
or deceptive act did not occur in 'the conduct of any trade or
 
2
 Section 301(a) of the LMRA states:
 
Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a
labor organization representing employees in an industry
affecting commerce as defined in this Act, or between any
such labor organizations, may be brought in any district
court of the United States having jurisdiction of the
parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or
without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
commerce[.]'" A UDAP claim under HRS § 480-2(a) must stem from 
"conduct in any trade or commerce[,]" which is akin to the 
"business context" as has been developed in Massachusetts' case 
law. Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Hawai 'i 54, 65, 905 
P.2d 29, 40 (1995). Hawaiian's provision of information about insurance coverage to Wong was not an arm's-length transaction 
occurring in a "business context" but rather occurred in the 
context of a relationship between an employer and former 
employee. 
Wong contends the circuit court's alleged errors 
violated his constitutional due process and equal protection 
rights, but does not point to where he raised these claims to the 
circuit court. We therefore disregard this point. See Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 28(b)(4) and (7); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai
'i 243, 251, 30 P.3d 
257, 265 (2001) ("Appellate courts will not consider an issue not raised below unless justice so requires.") (citations and 
brackets omitted). 
Finally, Wong contends the circuit court erred by
 
granting Hawaiian's motion for taxation of costs because: (1) the
 
motion was untimely; (2) the circuit court had no jurisdiction to
 
issue the order; and (3) the award of costs was excessive and not
 
reasonably necessary.
 
Hawaiian's motion was not untimely because: (1) the 
five-day limitation under Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
54(d)(1) applied to Wong's objections, requesting the circuit court review the clerk's action, and not to Hawaiian's motion for 
taxation of costs; and (2) HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) "provides that the 
court has 90 days to dispose of a postjudgment motion for costs, 
regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed[.]" Buscher v. 
Boning, 114 Hawai
'i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007). Wong 
fails to show that he carried his burden of showing the circuit 
court's costs award was "inequitable under the circumstances." 
See Wong v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai 'i 46, 52, 961 P.2d 611, 617 (1998) 
(citations omitted and format altered). 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Because we dispose of Wong's contentions in favor of
 
Hawaiian, we need not reach Hawaiian's claim that the circuit
 
court erred by finding Wong was a "consumer" under HRS chapter
 
480.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the (1) April 10, 2013 "Order
Granting Defendant Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.'s Motion for Summary
 Judgment, Filed January 29, 2013;" and (2) June 7, 2013 Final
 
Judgment both entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
are affirmed.
