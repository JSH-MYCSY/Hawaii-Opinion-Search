SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Walter Y.
 
Arakaki, General Contractor Inc. (Arakaki) appeals from the April
 
18, 2013 "Order Denying Walter Y. Arakaki, General Contractor,
 
Inc.'s Renewed Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees Because of
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Abusive Litigation Practices" (Arakaki's Renewed Motion), entered
1
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
Arakaki contends the circuit court erred by: 

(1) ruling no clear evidence existed to show that
 
Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee SCD-Olanani Corporation
 
(SCD) acted in bad faith when it: (a) opposed enforcement of the
 
parties' December 21, 2000 settlement on September 16, 2008 and
 April 12, 2011, and (b) moved to set aside the December 21, 2000
 
settlement on September 16, 2008; and 
(2) ruling no clear evidence existed to show that: (a) 
SCD acted in bad faith when SCD's counsel argued on May 9, 2011 
that the subject property located at 45-539 Mokulele Drive, 
Kane
'ohe, Hawai 'i 96744, TMK No. (1)4-5-38-15 (Property) had to be 
remediated to remove asbestos, and (b) SCD expended $200,000 towards this end. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Arakaki's appeal is without merit.
 Arakaki contends the circuit court should have awarded 
attorneys' fees because SCD engaged in abusive litigation 
practices. Circuit courts have the inherent power to curb abuses 
and promote a fair process, including the power to "assess 
attorney's fees for abusive litigation practices[.]" Kukui Nuts 
of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., 6 Haw. App. 431, 436, 726 P.2d 268, 272 (1986) (quoting Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 
752, 764 (1980)). A "particularized showing of bad faith is 
required to justify the use of the court's inherent power[.]" 
Kaina v. Gellman, 119 Hawai
'i 324, 331, 197 P.3d 776, 783 (2008) 
(citing Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai 'i 452, 
458, 903 P.2d 1273, 1279 (1995)). A showing of bad faith must be 
supported by clear and convincing evidence. See Matsuura v. E.I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 102 Hawai 'i 149, 152 n.7, 73 P.3d 687, 
690 n.7 (2003) opinion after certified question answered, 330 F.

Supp. 2d 1101 (D. Hawai 'i 2004), rev'd and remanded sub nom. 
Living Designs, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 431 F.3d 
353 (9th Cir. 2005) (concluding trial court's findings that 
defendant engaged in abusive litigation practices in bad faith 
were based on clear and convincing evidence). See also Bank of 
Hawaii v. Kunimoto, 91 Hawai 'i 372, 393, 984 P.2d 1198, 1219 
(1999) (concluding the lower court's finding of an attorney's bad 
faith conduct was properly supported by clear and convincing 
evidence in the record). In this case, there was no clear and 
convincing evidence of abusive litigation practices by SCD. 
Contrary to Arakaki's contention, the circuit court did 
not "ignore[]" SCD's alleged admission that it lacked a basis to 
substantiate allegations of fraud underlying the 1996 sale of the 
Property by Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Stephen 
Swift. The record includes letters from the State of Hawai 'i 
Department of Health, Solid and Hazardous Waste Branch (DOH) dated August 14, 1992 and February 18, 1993 that indicated a 
"history of [construction/demolition] waste burial at the site." 
The circuit court further considered "clarifications" in DOH's 
subsequent November 18, 2003 letter, which stated DOH did not 
"imply that there is no contamination associated with the 
materials placed at the site." The circuit court did not err by 
finding SCD's reliance on DOH's 1992 and 1993 letters, even in 
light of DOH's clarifications in 2003, did not constitute clear 
and convincing evidence of bad faith. 
The record reflects that prior to May 31, 1996, a
 
consultant inspected the Property and concluded "[i]t is
 
impossible to declare that there are no hazardous materials on
 
the [Property]" and a September 4, 2001 report by Clayton Group
 
Services (Clayton Report) included an interview with an adjacent
 
property owner who stated, "a demolition contractor purchased the
 
[Property] and disposed of building materials . . . [and]
 
governmental authorities visited the site and fined the
 
contractor for dumping debris and asbestos-containing materials."
 
DOH's assumptions as presented in its November 18, 2003
 
correspondence, together with other evidence, including the
 
Clayton Report, constituted credible evidence supporting the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court's finding that there was no clear and convincing
 
evidence that SCD's fraud and mutual mistake arguments regarding
 
the 1996 sale of the Property were made in bad faith. 
Arakaki contends SCD counsel's error regarding SCD's
 
expenditures on clean-up and remediation of asbestos on the
 
Property and the contents of the Clayton Report were evidence of
 
SCD's bad faith. Arakaki notes that the Clayton Report stated
 
that its "assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized
 
environmental conditions in connection with this property." 
However, the Clayton Report further stated that five tiles
 
containing asbestos were observed and that a "limited asbestos
 
survey" had been conducted, but that the "asbestos sampling was
 
limited in nature, and cannot be considered a comprehensive
 
asbestos inspection. The results of the analyses should not be
 
interpreted to include all asbestos or all building materials." 
At the March 13, 2013 hearing, SCD's counsel agreed with the
 
circuit court that the Clayton Report was inconclusive as to the
 
extent of asbestos contamination.
 
Regarding SCD counsel's representation that $200,000
 
was expended in clean up and remediation of asbestos, the circuit
 
court declined to find SCD or SCD's counsel engaged in bad faith
 
litigation practices because SCD's counsel disclosed his error to
 
the circuit court at the March 13, 2013 hearing and the
 
allegations of bad faith litigation practices did not extend to
 
SCD's counsel. The circuit court did not err by not finding
 
clear and convincing evidence that SCD's counsel acted in bad
 
faith. 
Arakaki also contends that SCD's mid-December 2009
 
"supplemental response" to Arakaki's discovery requests showed
 
the lack of substantiation for SCD's property-sale fraud claims
 
and therefore SCD's continued litigation on these bases
 
constituted abusive litigation practices. In its April 12, 2011
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and For Dismissal of Case,
 
Arakaki referred specifically to Exhibits "U"-"W", documents
 
produced by SCD in response to Arakaki's discovery requests. 
While Exhibits "U"-"W" showed SCD's knowledge of unauthorized
 
dumping activity after the 1996 Property sale, they did not

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
establish that SCD knew that no unauthorized activity or asbestos
 
contamination occurred prior to 1996.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the April 18, 2013 "Order
 
Denying Walter Y. Arakaki, General Contractor, Inc.'s Renewed
 Motion for Award of Attorneys' Fees Because of Abusive Litigation
 
Practices," entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 
affirmed.
