(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondents-Appellants Dan Deigert and Edith Deigert
 
(collectively, the Deigerts), individually and as trustees of the
 
Edith M. Deigert Revocable Living Trust Dated April 22, 2006
 
appeal from the (1) March 4, 2013 "Order Granting in Part and

1/17/2013 and Denying Respondents Deigert's Motion to Extend

International Colony Club's Motion for Order to Show Cause Filed
 
1/17/2013 and Denying Respondents Deigert's Motion to Extend
 
Deadline Filed 1/10/2013, Filed 3/4/2013," both entered in the
1
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court).
 
The Deigerts contend the circuit court erred by: 
(1) ruling on the merits of issues raised without
 
issuing an order to show cause;
 
(2) issuing orders that were not supported by evidence; 
(3) issuing orders that erroneously amended the prior
 
judgment of the circuit court; and
 
(4) allowing Petitioner-Appellee Association of
 
Apartment Owners of International Colony Club (AOAO) to do
 renovations without submitting plans and a cost estimate for work
 
to be done.
2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude the
 
Deigerts' appeal is without merit.
 
The circuit court was not required to issue an order to 
show cause to grant AOAO's second motion for an order to show 
cause, filed on January 17, 2013. AOAO's motion was based on 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 70, which provides in 
relevant part:
Rule 70.  JUDGMENT FOR SPECIFIC ACTS; VESTING TITLE.
 
If a judgment directs a party to execute a conveyance
of land or to deliver deeds or other documents or to perform
any other specific act and the party fails to comply within
the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done
at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person
appointed by the court and the act when so done has like
effect as if done by the party.

 The Deigerts' opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) because its "argument" section does
not cite to authorities, statutes, and parts of the record relied upon. The Deigerts' counsel is warned, future noncompliance may result in sanctions.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court issued an December 17, 2012 order
 
directing the Deigerts to submit plans and specifications to AOAO
 
by December 27, 2012 for the completion of specified restoration
 
work necessary to return unit #34 to its original condition. The
 
Deigerts failed to comply within that time. The circuit court's
 
March 4, 2013 Order authorized AOAO to complete the specified
 
restoration work that was required of the Deigerts in the circuit
 
court's December 17, 2012 order, with the Deigerts responsible
 
for all costs.
 
The Deigerts' second contention consisted of conclusory
 
statements that the circuit court's order was not supported by
 
evidence. The Deigerts fail to support this contention with
 
argument, evidence, or reference to the record. We deem this
 
point of error waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
The Deigerts' third contention is that there is an
 
inconsistency between wording in the March 4, 2013 Order, which
 
authorized AOAO "to complete the Restoration Work necessary to
 
return Unit #34 to its original condition," and the circuit
3
court's earlier April 14, 2009 judgment,  which required the
Deigerts to "restore Unit #34 to its original condition at the
 
time the Deigerts purchased the Unit." The Deigerts claim, but
 
do not establish, that the language of the March 4, 2013 Order
 
exceeds the scope of the language in the April 14, 2009 judgment. 
Contrary to the Deigerts' contention, the failure to include the
 
words "at the time the Deigerts purchased the Unit" in the March
 
4, 2013 Order does not amend the circuit court's April 14, 2009
 
judgment.
 
In support of their fourth contention, the Deigerts

 
argue: "as it may have been appropriate to require [the Deigerts]
 
to submit plans before commencing the restoration work, it was
 
equally appropriate to require AOAO to submit plans before

 The Deigerts' opening brief refers to a Judgment filed on April
22, 2009. Upon review of the record, no such judgment is found and contents
of the April 14, 2009 judgment are consistent with the Deigerts' argument.

commencing the restoration work." The circuit court required the
 
Deigerts to submit plans in compliance with AOAO's governing
 
documents and by-laws, which do not contain provisions requiring
 
AOAO to submit work plans to owners. Further, the circuit court
 
authorizing AOAO to take on the role of planning and completing
 
the renovation work was consequent to the Deigerts' failure to do
 
so. Contrary to the Deigerts' contention, "equity" did not
 
require the circuit court to order AOAO to submit work plans and
 
cost estimates.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the (1) March 4, 2013 "Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petitioner Association of
 
Apartment Owners of International Colony Club's Motion for Order
 to Show Cause Filed 1/17/2013 and Denying Respondents Deigert's
 Motion to Extend Deadline Filed 1/10/2013"; and (2) April 17,
 2013 "Order Denying Respondents Dan Deigert and Edith Deigert's
 Motion for Reconsideration of Order Granting in Part and Denying
