NO. CAAP-13-0000888
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
PAUL KAUKA CULLEN, also known as PAUL KAUKA NAKI, et al.,
Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. MR. and MRS. RICHARD P. and
GWENDOLYN H. PERREIRA, et al., Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
MOLOKA 'I DIVISION
 
(DC CIVIL NO. 13-1-0122)
 
AMENDED SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Paul Kauka Cullen, also known as 
Paul Kauka Naki (Cullen), pro se, appeals from the "Decisions and 
Orders: 1) Granting Defendants' Motion to Set Aside Judgment Filed March 15, 2013; 2) Setting Aside the Writ of Possession Filed February 20, 2013; 3) Dismissing with Prejudice [Cullen's] Claims Filed January 14, 2013," issued on April 24, 2013, in the District Court of the Second Circuit, Moloka
'i Division (District 
Court).1 
On appeal, Cullen appears to argue that the District
 
Court erred, violated his right to due process, and exhibited
 bias against him by granting a "Motion to Set Aside Default
 Entered February 8, 2013" (Motion to Set Aside Default), filed by
 Defendants-Appellees Richard P. and Gwendolyn H. Perreira
 (Appellees), and dismissing Cullen's January 14, 2013 "Complaint
 (Assumpsit-Summary Possession/Landlord-Tenant, Damages)"
 (Complaint).

 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Cullen's points of error as follows.
 
(1) The District Court erred in granting the Motion to
 
Set Aside Default, which was improperly filed on behalf of
 Appellees by Victoria Nohealani Kaluna-Palafox (Kaluna-Palafox),
2
 
who is unauthorized to practice law. See Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
§§ 605-2 (1993) and -14 (Supp. 2014); Oahu Plumbing & Sheet
 Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d
 570, 573 (1979).

(2) The District Court erred by dismissing the
 
Complaint, where it appears that no motion to dismiss was pending
 and Cullen was given no notice that the court was contemplating
 dismissal. See DCRCP Rule 41(b). See, e.g., Compass Dev., Inc.
 
v. Blevins, 10 Haw. App. 388, 395-96, 876 P.2d 1335, 1339 (1994);
 KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 80, 110 P.3d 397, 404 (2005); 
Lucas v. Dep't of Corr., 66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995).4
 
2 Kaluna-Palafox is designated as "Victoria N. Kaluna-Palafox, Heir
of Lydia Pua Kamoku, with written Permission by Douglas K. Kamoku-Personal
Representative of the Estate of Lydia Pua Kamoku," in the Motion to Set Aside
Default; and as "Konohiki Victoria Nohealani Kaluna-Palafox, a Hawaiian
National and Private Citizen, Agent representing her kin and 'Native Tenants'
domiciled on said Hawaiian owned trust land," in another pleading filed in the
district court.
 
3 We note that Appellees' motion to set aside did not include a
affidavit by Appellees. District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule
12.1 provides,
 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is area action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of the defendant's claim.

 The applicable rule, DCRCP Rule 12(b)(6), is essentially identical
to its federal counterpart. "In construing Hawai' i rules of procedure
patterned after federal rules, interpretations of the cognate federal rules bythe federal courts are deemed 'highly persuasive' by our appellate courts."Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai' i 422, 431, 16 P.3d 827, 836
(App. 2000).

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Decisions and 
Orders: 1) Granting Defendants' Motion to Set Aside Judgment 
Filed March 15, 2013; 2) Setting Aside the Writ of Possession Filed February 20, 2013; 3) Dismissing with Prejudice Claims Filed January 14, 2013," entered on April 24, 2013, in the District Court of the Second Circuit, Moloka
'i Division, is 
vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order and without prejudice to Appellees' right to seek further relief.
