NO. CAAP-13-0000909
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
THE ESTATE OF
 
HYON SUK HUGHES, Deceased
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(P. NO. 10-1-0283)
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) "Appellee Soo Chun Pak's 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal" (Motion to Dismiss) filed on October 3, 
2013, (2) "[Appellant Robert W. Fritz's (Fritz)] Motion for Leave to file Late Response to [the Motion to Dismiss]" (Motion to File Late Response) filed on October 23, 2013, and (3) "[Fritz's] Memorandum Regarding [the Motion to Dismiss]" filed on October 23, 2013, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal that Fritz has asserted from the Honorable Patrick W. Border's January 16, 2013 "Order Regarding Personal Representative Soo Chun Pak's Motions Filed October 4, 2012" (January 16, 2013 Order) because it is not independently appealable under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012), Rule 34(a) of the Hawai
'i Probate 
Rules (HPR), and Rule 54(b) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP). 
HRS § 641-1(a) expressly authorizes appeals from civil
 
circuit court final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under
 HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "[HPR] Rule 34 is written to
 
conform probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals,
 
see, e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright,  76 Haw.
 
115, 869 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty
 to the timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to
 comply with the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Commentary to HPR
 Rule 34 in Michie's Court Rules (2013). 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the
 rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The relevant rule of the
 probate court, HPR Rule 34(a), provides as follows.
 
Rule 34. Entry of Judgment, interlocutory orders, appeals.
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and ordersestablishing protective arrangements shall be reduced tojudgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk ofthe court. Such judgments shall be final and immediatelyappealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which itrelates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, maybe certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any other
order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the order must becertified for appeal in accordance with Section 641-1(b) of theHawai'i Revised Statutes. 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and otherorders appealable as provided by law may be appealedpursuant to the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions. 
Under the holding in Jenkins, "[a]n appeal may be
 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment
 
and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the
 appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 76 Hawai
'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n appeal from any
 judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not,
 on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or
 contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule]
 
54(b)." Id. Furthermore, whenever HRCP Rule 54(b)-certification
 
is necessary, "a party cannot appeal from a circuit court order
 even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification
 language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." 
Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai 'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 
1234, 1239 (1994). 
Although the circuit court (rather than the probate
 
court) entered the January 16, 2013 Order, HPR Rule 20(f)
 provides that whenever a probate court assigns a contested matter
 to the circuit court civil calendar, "[a]n order resolving the
 issues in a contested matter shall be reduced to judgment in
 accordance with Rule 34 of these rules and may be appealed as
 provided therein." 
The January 16, 2013 Order did not finally end the 
probate proceeding in Probate No. 10-1-0283. See HPR Rule 34(c). 
Thus, under the requirements for an appealable HPR Rule 34 judgment, the January 16, 2013 Order would be appealable only if it were "certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure," HPR 
Rule 34(a), and reduced to an HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment, Oppenheimer, 77 Hawai
'i at 93, 881 P.2d at 1239. It was not 
54(b)-certified. 
Further, the January 16, 2013 Order is not appealable
 
pursuant to HPR Rule 34(b) because it was not certified for
 appeal pursuant to § 641-1(b). See HPR Rule 34(b). 
Although common-law exceptions to the final judgment 
requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the January 16, 2013 Order does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). 
Consequently, the January 16, 2013 Order is ineligible
 
for appellate review under HRS § 641-1 and HPR Rule 34. Absent
 an appealable final judgment, this appeal is premature, and we
 lack appellate jurisdiction over this case.
