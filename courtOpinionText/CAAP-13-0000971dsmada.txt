NO. CAAP-13-0000971
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF ROSE MARIE ALVARO
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(PROBATE NO. 03-1-0018)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that
 
this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
Appellant U.S. Bank
 
National Association, as Trustee for Structured Asset Securities
 
Corporation, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-SC1
 (Appellant) appeals from the Order Granting Sesha Lovelace's
 Petition for Determination of Good Faith Settlement with the
 Estate Filed December 31, 2012 (Order), filed on April 29, 2013
 in the Probate Court of the First Circuit. Appellant appeals
 pursuant Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) and/or 663­15.5. It appears, based on the record on appeal, neither
 
statutory provision provides appellate jurisdiction.

In addition, HRS § 663-15.5(e) states: "A party
 
aggrieved by a court determination on the issue of good faith may 
appeal the determination. The appeal shall be filed within twenty days after service of written notice of the determination, or within any additional time not exceeding twenty days as the court may allow." Appellant is not a party within the meaning of HRS § 663-15.5 because it did not move to intervene in the proceeding for determination of good faith settlement. Abaya v. 
Mantell, 112 Hawai' i 176, 145 P.3d 719 (2006). Therefore, 
Appellant lacks standing to appeal pursuant to HRS § 663-15.5. Id. 
HRS § 641-1(a) states: "Appeals shall be allowed in 
civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602." Rule 34(a) of the Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR) states: 
Rule 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS,
APPEALS.
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, ordersestablishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, andorders establishing protective arrangements shall bereduced to judgment and the judgment shall be filedwith the clerk of the court. Such judgments shall befinal and immediately appealable as provided bystatute. Any other order that fully addresses allclaims raised in a petition to which it relates, butthat does not finally end the proceeding, may becertified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule54(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(emphasis added). 
All claims raised in the Petition for Determination of
 
Good Faith Settlement with the Estate were fully addressed in the
 
Order. However, the Order did not finally end the formal probate
 proceeding and was not certified pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Civil Procedure Rule 54(b). There is no final judgment closing
 
the proceeding, pursuant to HRP Rule 34(c). Therefore, HRS §
 641-1(a) is inapplicable. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
