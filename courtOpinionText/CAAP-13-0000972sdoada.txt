With Reporting an Emergency or Crime in violation of HRS § 710­
1010.5(1) (Supp. 2013) (Count II).3
 
On appeal, Hernandez contends the circuit court
 
reversibly erred by: 
(1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the
 
basis that there was a lack of substantial evidence supporting
 
his conviction of Counts I and II; and
 
(2) giving the jury Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i's (State) proposed instruction no. "3" over his 
objection. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Hernandez's points of error as follows.
 (1) Hernandez contends the circuit court lacked
 
substantial evidence to support his conviction of Count I because
 
an estimate, as opposed to the actual cost, of repairing the
 
vehicle was "too speculative to meet the standard of substantial
 
evidence." Also, Hernandez never admitted to an intent to cause
 
damage to property exceeding $500 and no substantial evidence
 
demonstrated such an intent.
 
Evidence of the cost of reasonable repairs is an 
appropriate means to establish damages exceeding $500 as an 
element of the crime of third degree criminal property damage. 
State v. Pardee, 86 Hawai
'i 165, 170, 948 P.2d 586, 591 (App. 
1997), citing HRS § 708-822(b). The complaining witness, Walter Konishi (Konishi) testified the owner-operator of GDK Auto 
Repair, Gordon Kim (Kim) estimated the cost of repair to his car, 
damaged by Hernandez, at approximately $1,521. Kim testified to 
the same cost of repair, as well as, to his experience with 
3 
HRS § 710-1010.5(1) provides:
 
§710-1010.5  Interference with reporting an emergency or
 
crime.  ( 1) A person commits the offense of interference with
reporting an emergency or crime if the person intentionally or
knowingly prevents a victim or witness to a criminal act from
calling a 911-emergency telephone system, obtaining medical
assistance, or making a report to a law enforcement officer.

compiling estimates and the method by which he determined
 
estimated costs of repair. Hernandez asserted that an estimate
 
of over $1,500 by a China-based dealer did not represent a
 
reasonable cost of repair. Kim, however, testified that the
 
reason he was buying the rear lid glass from a China-based dealer
 
was that Konishi's vehicle was an older model and replacement
 
parts were difficult to obtain.
 
Hernandez asserted the State failed to establish
 
substantial evidence that he "ever knew or hoped that the damage
 
to the property exceeded $500.00." HRS § 708–801 (Supp. 2013)
 
provides in relevant part:
 
§708-801 Valuation of property or services. Whenever the
 
value of property or services is determinative of the class or
grade of an offense, or otherwise relevant to a prosecution, the
following shall apply:
 
. . . .
 
(4) When acting intentionally or knowingly with
respect to the value of property or services is required to
establish an element of an offense, the value of property or
services shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant
believed or knew the property or services to be of that
value.
 
(5) When acting intentionally or knowingly with
respect to the value of property or services is required to
establish an element of an offense, it is a defense, which
reduces the class or grade of the offense to a class or
grade of offense consistent with the defendant's state of
mind, that the defendant believed the valuation of the
property or services to be less.
 
(Emphasis added), discussed in State v. Cabrera, 90 Hawai 'i 359, 
368, 978 P.2d 797, 806 (1999). 
Hernandez introduced no evidence that he believed he
 
was causing damage to property worth less than $500 nor did he
 
rebut the State's prima facie evidence that he believed or knew
 
that the cost of repairing the damage he caused would exceed
 
$500. 
Regarding Count II, Hernandez contends, "there was a
 
lack of substantial evidence that the 911 call was actually
 
interfered with;" "there was no substantial interference with a
 
911 call because 911 was called and the police responded[;]" and
 
"[t]here is no evidence that [Hernandez] was aware, believed, or
 
hoped to interfere with any 911 call." Konishi testified he told

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hernandez he was going to call the police "because of what you 
[Hernandez] did" and Hernandez reacted by grabbing Konishi's 
phone and throwing it on the ground. Konishi's testimony 
constituted substantial evidence supporting Hernandez's 
conviction of Count II. State v. Pulse, 83 Hawai 'i 229, 244, 925 
P.2d 797, 812 amended on reconsideration in part, 83 Haw. 545, 928 P.2d 39 (1996) ("The testimony of one percipient witness can 
provide sufficient evidence to support a conviction."). 
(2) Jury instruction no. "3" stated "[t]he amount of
 
damage done to property may be established by the cost to repair
 
that property." Citing Pardee. Hernandez provides no argument
 
in support of his contention that the circuit court erred by
 
allowing jury instruction no. "3" to go to the jury. Jury
 
instruction no. "3" was not "misleading" as Hernandez's counsel
 
contended at trial, but rather presented an accurate statement of
 
law.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the April 19, 2013 "Judgment
 
of Conviction and Sentencing; Notice of Entry" and the April 19,
 2013 "Mittimus," both entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit are affirmed.
