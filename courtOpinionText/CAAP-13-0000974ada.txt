NAKAMURA, CHIEF JUDGE, AND FOLEY AND LEONARD, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, C.J.

 
After pleading guilty to a felony drug offense,
 
Defendant-Appellee Michael Frazer (Frazer) was granted a
 
conditional discharge pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
1
§ 712-1255 (2014)  and placed on probation subject to conditions 
1HRS § 712-1255 provides:
 
Conditional discharge. (1) Whenever any person who has not
previously been convicted of any offense under this chapter or
chapter 329 or under any statute of the United States or of any
state relating to a dangerous drug, harmful drug, detrimental
drug, or an intoxicating compound, pleads guilty to or is found
guilty of promoting a dangerous drug, harmful drug, detrimental
drug, or an intoxicating compound under section 712-1243,
712-1245, 712-1246, 712-1248, 712-1249, or 712-1250, the court,

for five years. While still within the five-year probationary
 
period, Frazer allegedly possessed a semi-automatic firearm and
 used it to threaten another person. Plaintiff-Appellant State of
 Hawai
'i (State) charged Frazer with first-degree terroristic 
threatening with the use of a dangerous weapon, namely, a
 semiautomatic firearm (Count 1); and possession of a firearm
 while "under indictment" for a felony (Count 2).
 
Count 2 charged a violation of HRS § 134-7(b) (2011),
which provides:
 

 
No person who is under indictment for, or has waived
indictment for, or has been bound over to the circuit court
for, or has been convicted in this State or elsewhere of
having committed a felony, or any crime of violence, or an
illegal sale of any drug shall own, possess, or control any
firearm or ammunition therefor.
 
Frazer was not charged with being a convicted felon in
 
possession of a firearm, but only with possessing a firearm while
 
"under indictment for a felony[.]" Thus, the question presented
 
1(...continued)
accused, may defer further proceedings and place the accused on
probation upon terms and conditions. Upon violation of a term or
condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and
proceed as otherwise provided.
 
(2)
 Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court
shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the
person.
 
(3) Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be
without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes
of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or
disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime.
 
(4) There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this
section with respect to any person.
 
(5) After conviction, for any offense under this chapter or
chapter 329, but prior to sentencing, the court shall be advised
by the prosecutor whether the conviction is defendant's first or a
subsequent offense. If it is not a first offense, the prosecutor
shall file an information setting forth the prior convictions.
The defendant shall have the opportunity in open court to affirm
or deny that the defendant is identical with the person previously
convicted. If the defendant denies the identity, sentence shall
be postponed for such time as to permit the trial, before a jury
if the defendant has a right to trial by jury and demands a jury,
on the sole issue of the defendant's identity with the person
previously convicted.

in this appeal is whether a person, like Frazer, who is indicted
 
on a felony and is still serving the probationary term imposed on
 a conditional discharge is "under indictment" within the meaning
 of HRS § 134-7(b).
 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)
2
 
ruled that Frazer was not "under indictment" when he was serving
 the probationary term of his conditional discharge, and it
 therefore dismissed Count 2. We conclude that the Circuit Court
 erred, and we vacate its dismissal of Count 2.
 
As explained in greater detail below, the language and
 
legislative history of HRS § 134-7(b) make clear that for a
 person, like Frazer, who is indicted on a felony, HRS § 134-7(b)
 prohibits such person from possessing a firearm for the full
 continuum of time that begins with the indictment and continues
 until the charge is resolved by conviction, acquittal, or
 dismissal. If the person is convicted, the prohibition against
 possessing a firearm continues based on the person's status as a
 convicted felon. Only if the person's felony charge is resolved
 by acquittal or dismissal does the prohibition against possessing
 a firearm, which arose from the person's felony indictment, come
 to an end.
 
Under our interpretation of HRS § 134-7(b), the statute 
clearly prohibits a person who is indicted on a felony and is still serving the probationary term of a conditional discharge from possessing a firearm because the person's felony charge has not been resolved -- there is no acquittal and the charge has not yet been dismissed. There is a question of whether such person should be considered a convicted felon rather than under indictment while serving the probationary term of the conditional discharge. However, in State v. Ritte, 68 Haw. 253, 710 P.2d 1197 (1985), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that a person who was 
serving a probationary term on a deferred acceptance of guilty

plea under HRS § 853-13
 was not a "convicted" person for purposes
of HRS § 134-7(b). 
Given the similar purpose and effect of HRS 
§ 853-1 and HRS § 712-1255, we conclude, based on 
Ritte, that a
 
person who is serving a probationary term on a conditional
 
3The version of HRS § 853-1 considered in  Ritte applied to guilty pleas,
but not to pleas of nolo contendere, whereas the current version of HRS § 853­
1 applies to both guilty pleas and pleas of nolo contendere. Other than this
 change, there are no material substantive differences between the version of
HRS § 853-1 considered in 
Ritte and the current version of HRS § 853-1. HRS §
853-1 (2014) now provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
 
Deferred acceptance of guilty plea or nolo contendere plea;
discharge and dismissal, expungement of records. (a) Upon proper
motion as provided by this chapter:
 
(1)	 When a defendant voluntarily pleads guilty or nolo
contendere, prior to commencement of trial, to a
felony, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor;
 
(2)	 It appears to the court that the defendant is not
likely again to engage in a criminal course of
conduct; and
 
(3) 	The ends of justice and the welfare of society do not
require that the defendant shall presently suffer the
penalty imposed by law,
 
the court, without accepting the plea of nolo contendere or
entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the defendant
and after considering the recommendations, if any, of the
prosecutor, may defer further proceedings.
 
(b) The proceedings may be deferred upon any of the
conditions specified by section 706-624. . . . The court may
defer the proceedings for a period of time as the court shall
direct but in no case to exceed the maximum sentence allowable;
provided that, if the defendant has entered a plea of guilty or
nolo contendere to a petty misdemeanor, the court may defer the
proceedings for a period not to exceed one year. The defendant
 may be subject to bail or recognizance at the court's discretion
during the period during which the proceedings are deferred.
 
(c) Upon the defendant's completion of the period designated
by the court and in compliance with the terms and conditions
established, the court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss
the charge against the defendant.
 
(d) Discharge of the defendant and dismissal of the charge
against the defendant under this section shall be without
adjudication of guilt, shall eliminate any civil admission of
guilt, and is not a conviction.
 
(e) Upon discharge of the defendant and dismissal of the
charge against the defendant under this section, the defendant may
apply for expungement not less than one year following discharge,
pursuant to section 831-3.2.

discharge is likewise not a "convicted" person for purposes of
 
HRS § 134-7(b).
 
The charge against a defendant who is granted a
 
conditional discharge (or deferred acceptance of guilty or nolo
 contendere plea) is not dismissed and remains pending until the
 defendant successfully completes the probationary term imposed. 
See HRS § 712-1255(2), HRS § 853-1(c). Frazer's felony drug
 charge, on which he had been indicted, was still not resolved
 while he was serving the probationary term on his conditional
 discharge. We hold that Frazer was "under indictment" for
 purposes of HRS § 134-7(b) after he was granted a conditional
 discharge and while he was serving the probationary term imposed. 
Accordingly, we vacate the Circuit Court's decision to dismiss
 Count 2 and remand the case for further proceedings.
 
BACKGROUND
 
I.
 
In 2008, Frazer was indicted in Cr. No. 08-1-0354 on
 
one count of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree,
 which is a felony, and one count of violating an order for
 protection. On December 2, 2008, Frazer pleaded guilty to both
 counts. On March 18, 2009, Frazer was granted a conditional
 discharge pursuant to HRS § 712-1255 on the count for promoting a
 dangerous drug in the third degree, and the Circuit Court
 deferred the proceedings and imposed a five-year term of
 probation subject to conditions on that count. The Circuit Court
 sentenced Frazer to a two-year term of probation on the count for
 violating an order for protection.
4
 
On February 1, 2012, Frazer was indicted in this case
 
and charged in Count 1 with first-degree terroristic threatening
 with the use of a dangerous weapon, to wit, a semiautomatic
 firearm, and in Count 2 with possession of a firearm while "under
 indictment for a felony[.]" On the date that he allegedly

case. The Circuit Court relied upon the parties' representations of what
happened in Cr. No. 08-1-0354 in rendering its ruling in this case.

committed the offenses charged in Counts 1 and 2, Frazer was
 
still serving the five-year probationary term on his conditional
 discharge for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree. 
Count 2 charged, in relevant part, that
 
MICHAEL FRAZER, a person who is under indictment for a
felony, with knowledge or reckless disregard of the
substantial and unjustifiable risk that he is under said
indictment, did intentionally or knowingly own, possess, or
control an object, with intent, knowledge, or reckless
disregard of the substantial and unjustifiable risk that the
object was a firearm, thereby committing the offense of
Ownership or Possession Prohibited of Any Firearm or
Ammunition by a Person Indicted for Certain Crimes, in
violation of Section 134-7(b) and (h) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes.
 
II.
 
Prior to trial, Frazer moved to dismiss Count 2. The
 
Circuit Court granted the motion, and on April 22, 2013, it
 
issued its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Indictment"
 (Dismissal Order). In its Dismissal Order, the Circuit Court
 referred to the grant of a conditional discharge, deferral of the
 proceedings, and placement on probation under HRS § 712-1255 as
 being "sentenced" to a "conditional discharge" under HRS § 712­1255. It ruled that a person who has been granted a conditional
 discharge and "sentenced" to a period of probation under HRS 
§ 712-1255 is neither a convicted felon nor under indictment. 
The Circuit Court interpreted the phrase "under indictment" as
 used in HRS § 134-7(b) to refer to the pre-trial status of a
 defendant pending trial. The Circuit Court noted that in order
 for a court to grant a conditional discharge and place a
 defendant on probation under HRS § 712-1255, the defendant must
 already have pleaded guilty or been found guilty at trial. The
 Circuit Court concluded that because a defendant, like Frazer,
 who is granted a conditional discharge and is serving a
 probationary term is no longer pending trial, such defendant is
 not "under indictment" and cannot be charged with possessing a
 firearm while under indictment.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Circuit Court's pertinent findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law were as follows:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . .
 
6.	 The term "under indictment" as used in HRS 134-7(b)
refers to the pre-trial status of a Defendant who is
pending trial.
 
7.	 "Under Indictment" does not extend to individuals who
 have been sentenced to a Conditional Discharge.
 
8.	 The Defendant, Michael Frazer, was still on
Conditional Discharge status at the time of the
indictment, and therefore he had already been
sentenced and was no longer pending trial. He was no
 longer "under indictment." 
. . . .
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
. . . .
 
5.	 This court's interpretation of the plain meaning of
"under indictment" is that it pertains to those
defendants who are pending trial. A defendant who has
 already been sentenced is not 'under indictment.'
 
. . . .
 
7.	 As provided for in HRS 712-1255, a defendant who has
been sentenced to a Conditional Discharge is not a
convicted felon nor is he or she still pending trial.
A defendant who has been sentenced to a Conditional
 Discharge has already either plead Guilty or No
Contest, or could have even gone to trial. He or she
 is clearly no longer pending trial and therefore is no
longer 'under indictment'.
 
8.	 The intent of the legislature in amending HRS 134-7(b)
was to include this large class of people pending a
felony trial, into the already existing groups of
individuals who were prohibited from possessing
firearms. Its intent was not to include people who
had already been sentenced. HRS 134-7(b) already
covered those individuals.
 
9.	 Should, however, the term 'under indictment' be deemed
to be ambiguous, the Rule of Lenity would require that
HRS 134-7(b) be strictly construed in favor of the
accused and against the State. In the instant case,
the Rule of Lenity would require that HRS 134-7(b) be
strictly construed to apply to only those individuals
pending trial and not the Defendant, an individual who
had already been sentenced in 2009 to a Conditional
Discharge. The Rule of Lenity requires the court to
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
adopt a less expansive meaning over a more inclusive
one. To hold otherwise would lead to absurd results.
 
10.	 The Defendant Michael Frazer, an individual who had
been granted a Conditional Discharge under HRS 712­1255 in 2009, was not pending trial when he was
indicted in the instant case on February 1, 2012 and
therefore he was not 'under indictment.'
 
(Emphasis in original.)
 
In the alternative, the Circuit Court ruled that it
 
would exercise its inherent powers under HRS 603-21.9(6) (1993)5
 
to dismiss Count 2 because it did not believe the State could
 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial that Frazer at least
 recklessly disregarded the risk that he was under indictment when
 he allegedly possessed the firearm. The Circuit Court reasoned
 that "[i]f this court, after having been briefed and having
 researched the issue, doesn't believe that the Defendant was
 "under indictment" at the time he was indicted in the instant
 case and has ruled such; how could the State prove that the
 Defendant, a lay person with no legal background or training,
 knew or consciously disregarded that he was 'under indictment.'" 
Based on this reasoning, the Circuit Court concluded that Count 2
 would not have survived Frazer's motion for judgment of acquittal
 at trial, and therefore, it was exercising "its inherent powers
 to promote justice" in dismissing Count 2.
6
 
DISCUSSION
 
The State appeals from the Dismissal Order. On appeal,
 
the State argues that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Count
 2 because: (1) a defendant who is serving a probationary term on 
a conditional discharge granted pursuant to HRS § 712-1255 is
 "under indictment" and therefore Frazer was properly charged with
 
5HRS 603-21.9(6) provides that the circuit courts shall have power "[t]o
make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and mandates . . . and do such
other acts and take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full
effect the powers which are or shall be given to them by law or for the
promotion of justice in matters pending before them."
 
6Frazer went to trial and was found guilty on the first-degree
terroristic threatening charged in Count 1. Frazer challenged his conviction
on Count 1 in a separate appeal. 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
possessing a firearm while under indictment; and (2) the Circuit
Court overstepped its bounds in dismissing Count 2 based on itsinherent powers. 
As explained below, we conclude that Frazer was under
indictment within the meaning of HRS § 134-7(b) while he wasserving the five-year probationary term on his conditionaldischarge, and therefore, the Circuit Court erred in dismissingCount 2 based on its contrary conclusion that Frazer was notunder indictment during this period. We also conclude that theCircuit Court abused its discretion in relying on its inherentpowers to dismiss Count 2 before trial.
I.
Our decision in this case turns on the interpretation 
of relevant statutes. Statutory interpretation is a question of law that is subject to de novo review. Hawaii Gov't Emps. Ass'n,
AFSCME Local 152, AFL–CIO v. Lingle, 124 Hawai
'i 197, 201-202,
239 P.3d 1, 5-6 (2010). 
We are guided by the following 
principles in construing a statute: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremost obligation toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. Fourth, whenthere is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctivenessor uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, anambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguousstatute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought byexamining the context, with which the ambiguous words,phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order toascertain their true meaning.
Id. at 202, 239 P.3d at 6 (internal block quote format and 
citation omitted). In determining legislative intent, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids including the legislative history of the statute. Barnett v. State, 91 Hawai
'i 20, 31, 979 P.2d 1046,
1057 (1999). 
"Where the words of a law are ambiguous," the court 
may also consider "[t]he reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact it . . . to discover 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
10its true meaning."  HRS § 1-15 (2009).  "Laws in pari materia, or
upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference
to each other.  What is clear in one statute may be called upon
in aid to explain what is doubtful in another."  HRS § 1-16
(2009).
II.
A.
Frazer was charged with violating HRS § 134-7(b), which 
provides:
No person who is under indictment for, or has waived  
indictment for, or has been bound over to the circuit court  
for, or has been convicted in this State or elsewhere of  
having committed a felony, or any crime of viol
ence, or an  
illegal sale of any drug shall own, possess, or control any 
firearm or ammunition therefor.
(Emphases added.) 
As the Hawai# i Supreme Court stated in State v. Rapozo,
123 Hawai# i 329, 235 P.3d 325 (2010), HRS § 134-7(b) "reflects
the determination by the legislature that the possession of
firearms or ammunition by certain categories of people raises an
unacceptable risk that those items will be used for unlawful
purposes."  Rapozo, 123 Hawai# i at 340, 235 P.3d at 336.  The
plain language of HRS § 134-7(b) extends the prohibition against
possession of firearms beyond persons who have been convicted of
a felony to persons who are only under indictment for a felony. 
Thus, the legislature has determined that persons who have only
been charged by indictment with a felony, whose guilt has not
been proven, present unacceptable risks that require prohibiting
them from possessing firearms while their charges are pending. 
The legislative history of HRS § 134-7(b) also reveals repeated
actions of the Legislature over time to "expand[] the scope of
the statute by broadening the categories of both prohibited
persons and prohibited items."  Id. at 340, 235 P.3d at 336.  We
conclude that the language and legislative history of HRS § 134-
7(b) demonstrate the Legislature's clear intent not only to
prohibit convicted felons from possession firearms, but toFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
prohibit persons indicted for a felony from possessing firearms
from the time the indictment is returned and continuing withoutinterruption thereafter unless and until the charge is resolvedby acquittal or dismissal.
 B.
The legislative history of HRS § 134-7(b), in pertinent
part, is as follows. When the precursor of HRS § 134-7 was firstenacted in 1927, the statute provided:
No person who has been convicted in this territory, or
elsewhere, of having committed or attempted a crime ofviolence, shall own or have in his possession or under hiscontrol, a pistol or revolver.
1927 Sess. L., Act 206, § 4, at 209. Since that time, the
statute has been amended numerous times to broaden its scope. 
In 1971, the Legislature expanded the scope of HRS 
§ 134-7(b) to include all convicted felons, and it imposed amandatory minimum sentence for a violation of HRS § 134-7. 1971 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1 at 196; Rapozo, 123 Hawai
'i at 341,
235 P.3d at 337.7 As described by the House Judiciary Committee, 
the purpose of the bill that added these provisions was "to amend the existing firearms laws so that they will be more effective in deterring and preventing the proliferation of crimes involving the illegal possession and use of firearms in the State of Hawaii." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 931, in 1971 House Journal, at 1102. As amended in 1971, HRS § 134-7(b) provided: 
No person who has been convicted in this State or elsewhere
of having committed a felony or of the illegal use andpossession or sale of any drug shall own or have in hispossession or under his control any firearm of ammunitiontherefor.
1971 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1 at 196. 
In 1981, the Legislature expanded HRS § 134-7(b) to
include persons "under indictment" for a felony and other
specified offenses. As amended in 1981, HRS § 134-7(b)
7In 1975, the mandatory minimum sentencing provision was removed and the
maximum penalty for violation of HRS § 134-7 was increased from two years to
five years. See Rapozo, 123 Hawai' i at 341 n.8, 235 P.3d at 337 n.8.
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
prohibited the ownership, possession, or control of firearms or
 
ammunition by anyone "under indictment for . . . having committed
 a felony, or any crime of violence, or of the illegal sale of any
 drug[.]" 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 239, § 5 at 465. The
 Legislature indicated that the purpose of the bill containing the
 1981 amendment was "to restrict and control the acquisition and
 possession of firearms[,]" H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 727, in 1981
 House Journal, at 1241, and the Legislature recognized that the
 bill would "assist the police in stemming the rising rate of
 violent crimes involving the use of firearms, by having more
 stringent procedures for the identification, acquisition, and
 possession of firearms." Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 48, in 1981 House
 Journal, at 921.
 
Subsequent amendments further extended the scope of HRS 
§ 134-7(b) to include in 1982, any person who "has waived indictment" for a felony and other specified offenses, 1982 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 140, § 1 at 229, and to include in 1993, any person who "has been bound over to the circuit court" for a felony and other specified offenses. 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 215, § 1 at 380. Thus, the legislative history of HRS § 134-7(b) clearly shows a strong and consistent legislative intent to expand the scope of those prohibited from possessing firearms in order to prevent and deter crimes committed with firearms and thereby protect the public. See Rapozo, 123 Hawai
'i at 340-41, 
235 P.3d at 336-37.8 
8This legislative intent is also shown by amendments made to provisions
of HRS § 134-7 besides HRS § 134-7(b). For example, in 1990, the Legislature
amended HRS § 134-7 to add subsection (d) to prohibit persons who have, as
minors, been adjudicated by the family court to have committed a felony, two
or more crimes of violence, or an illegal sale of any drug from owning,
possessing, or controlling a firearm or ammunition until they reach the age of
twenty-five. 1990 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 191, § 1 at 419. In its report on the
bill that added subsection (d), the Senate Committee on Judiciary stated:
"Given the increase in the number of youth gangs and the related increases in
violence and drug trafficking, it is in the interest of the community that all
those persons with propensity to commit crimes of violence, crimes involving
the sales of drugs, and felonies be prohibited from possession or ownership of
a firearm." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1220-90, in 1990 House Journal, at 1324.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C. 
In its current formulation, which is applicable to this
 
case, HRS § 134-7(b) prohibits the following categories of people
 
from possessing firearms or ammunition: persons who have been
 convicted of, as well as persons who are under indictment for,
 have waived indictment for, or have been bound over to the
 circuit court for, a felony, any crime of violence, or an illegal
 sale of any drug. By expanding the scope of HRS § 134-7(b) to
 prohibit persons who are under felony indictment from possessing
 a firearm, the Legislature has determined that a person charged
 by indictment with a felony presents a risk of harm that is too
 great to permit that person to possess a firearm. The
 Legislature has therefore established that the filing of the
 felony indictment itself, before the felony charge has been
 proven, as the point at which the risks associated with the
 possession of a firearm become unacceptable. If the risks of
 firearm possession become unacceptable upon the filing of a
 felony indictment, these unacceptable risks certainly continue
 while the felony charge in the indictment remains pending and
 until it is resolved by acquittal or dismissal. 
Given the language of HRS § 134-7(b) and its spirit and
 
purpose as revealed by its legislative history, it is clear that
 for a person, like Frazer, who is indicted on a felony, HRS 
§ 134-7(b) prohibits such person from possessing a firearm for
 the full continuum of time that begins with the indictment and
 continues while the felony charge is pending and until the charge
 is resolved by conviction, acquittal, or dismissal. If the
 person is convicted, the prohibition against possessing a firearm
 continues based on the person's status as a convicted felon. 
Only if the person's charge is resolved by acquittal or dismissal
 does the prohibition against possessing a firearm, which began
 upon the person's felony indictment, come to an end.

III.
 
A.
 
Although the application of HRS § 134-7(b) is normally
 
straightforward, Frazer's status as a person serving a
 
probationary term on a conditional discharge pursuant to HRS 
§ 712-1255 at the time he allegedly possessed a firearm presents
 issues not typically found in an HRS § 134-7(b) prosecution. In
 particular, we must determine whether a person serving a
 probationary term on a conditional discharge falls within the
 categories of persons prohibited from possessing a firearm under
 HRS § 134-7(b), and if so, which category. 
Frazer was not charged with being a convicted felon in 
possession of a firearm, but only with possessing a firearm while under indictment for a felony. We first examine whether Frazer had the status of a person "convicted" of a felony within the meaning of HRS § 134-7(b) at the time he allegedly possessed the firearm charged in Count 2. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated 
that: 
The meaning of the term "convicted" or "conviction"
varies according to the context in which it appears and the
purpose to which it relates. The word "conviction" is more
 commonly used and understood to mean a verdict of guilty or
a plea of guilty. The more technical definition includes
 the judgment or sentence rendered pursuant to an
ascertainment of guilt. Use of the term "conviction" in a
 statute presents a question of legislative intent.
 
State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 166-67, 706 P.2d 1300, 1303 (1985)
 
(citations omitted). In Akana, the supreme court construed the
 meaning of the term "convicted" as used in a statute requiring
 the revocation of probation for a defendant who is "convicted of
 a felony." Id. at 165 n.1, 167, 706 P.2d at 1302 n.1, 1303. The
 
court held that in this context, the term "convicted" meant the
 "ascertainment of guilt by guilty plea, or by verdict, and does
 not mean a judgment of conviction[.]" Id. at 167, 706 P.2d at
 
1303. The court reached this conclusion in light of the
 Legislature's determination, in enacting the probation revocation
 provision, that "a defendant who commits a felony while on
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
probation is no longer deserving of freedom" or amenable to
 
rehabilitation and the Legislature's deep concern over a
 probationer committing a felony during his or her period of
 probation, as shown by its amending the statute in 1980 to
 mandate revocation in this situation. Id.
 
Given the purpose of HRS § 134-7(b) to protect the
 
public, it would appear that the broader, more commonly used
 meaning of "conviction" as a verdict of guilty or plea of guilty
 and "convicted" as an ascertainment of guilt by guilty verdict or
 guilty plea should apply to HRS § 134-7(b). See id. at 166-67,
 
706 P.2d at 1303; United States v. Faison, 61 F.3d 22, 23 (11th
 Cir. 1995) (holding that a jury verdict of guilty constitutes a
 conviction for purposes of the federal firearms statute and
 therefore the defendant was "convicted" of a felony during the
 interval between the jury's return of its guilty verdict and his
 scheduled sentencing); United States v. Bennett, 285 F.Supp.2d
 978, 986 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (same). Because the Legislature
 extended the scope of HRS § 134-7(b) in 1981 to include a
 defendant under indictment, the question of whether a defendant
 should be considered "convicted" between the time of a guilty
 verdict or guilty plea and sentencing does not affect the
 applicability of the statute -- if the defendant is not
 considered "convicted" during this time, he or she would
 certainly be considered to remain "under indictment." The
 Legislature clearly could not have intended that a guilty verdict
 or guilty plea would extinguish the prohibition against the
 defendant's possession of a firearm or ammunition. We conclude
 that in the normal case, i.e., a case in which a conditional
 discharge or deferred acceptance of guilty plea is not granted, a
 defendant who pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial has been
 convicted for purposes of HRS § 134-7(b).
 
B.
 
We read the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's decision in Ritte 
as carving out an exception to the normal case for defendants whose adjudication of guilt is deferred pursuant to HRS § 853-1 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
or HRS § 712-1255. In 1979, Ritte was granted a deferred 
acceptance of guilty (DAG) plea pursuant to HRS § 853-1 on a felony charge and placed on probation. Ritte, 68 Haw. at 255, 
710 P.2d at 1200. While still on probation for his DAG plea, Ritte allegedly possessed firearms and ammunition in 1983, which formed the basis for the State charging him with violating HRS § 134-7(b). Id. at 254-55, 710 P.2d at 1199-1200. When Ritte's 
DAG plea was entered in 1979, HRS § 134-7(b) prohibited persons convicted of a felony from possessing firearms or ammunition, but persons under indictment for a felony were not prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition until the statute was amended in 1981. Id. at 255-56, 710 P.2d at 1200. The Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court held that "a DAG plea is not a conviction" and therefore Ritte could not be charged with violating HRS § 134-7(b) as a convicted felon. Id. at 255, 710 P.2d at 1200. 
The supreme court then examined the savings clause for
 
the Act which contained the 1981 amendment to HRS § 134-7(b). 
The savings clause provided that the Act would take effect upon
 its approval and would not affect "any proceedings which were
 begun" before its effective date, which was June 24, 1981. Id.
 
at 256, 710 P.2d at 1200. The court held that because Ritte was
 under a DAG proceeding begun in 1979 before the effective date of
 the 1981 amendment, the 1981 amendment which extended the scope
 of HRS § 134-7(b) to those "under indictment" for a felony did
 not apply to Ritte. Id. The court therefore reversed Ritte's
 
conviction for violating HRS § 134-7(b). Id. 
C.
 
Based on Ritte's holding that a person on probation
 
pursuant to the granting of a DAG plea under HRS § 853-1 is not a
 "convicted" person for purposes of HRS §134-7(b), we conclude
 that a person on probation pursuant to the granting of a
 conditional discharge under HRS § 712-1255 is also not a
 convicted person. 
The purpose and effect of HRS § 712-1255 and HRS § 853­
1 are very similar. Both statutes permit a defendant who has
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
pleaded guilty to seek a deferral of further proceedings, and
 
both statutes enable a trial court, without entering a judgment
 of guilt, to defer further proceedings and place the defendant on
 conditions of probation. Both statutes provide that if the
 defendant successfully completes the term of probation, the
 defendant will be discharged, the proceedings against the
 defendant will be dismissed, and the defendant will not have a
 conviction. Given both statutes' similar purpose and effect, it
 would be anomalous to treat a defendant granted a deferral under
 one statute differently than a defendant granted a deferral under
 the other statute. Based on Ritte, we conclude that a defendant,
 like Frazer, who is on probation pursuant to a conditional
 discharge granted under HRS § 712-1255 is not a convicted person
 for purposes of HRS § 134-7(b).
 
IV.
 
The question then becomes whether a defendant on 
probation pursuant to a conditional discharge on an indicted felony is "under indictment" within the meaning of HRS § 134-7(b). Both the State and Frazer appear to interpret the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's discussion on the effect of the savings 
clause in Ritte to mean that the supreme court concluded that a person on probation under a DAG plea for an indicted felony is under indictment within the meaning of HRS § 134-7(b).
9 While 
the supreme court's discussion could be read in that fashion, the supreme court did not specifically decide this issue in Ritte. Accordingly, Ritte is not dispositive. As explained below, we conclude that Frazer was under indictment while he was serving the probationary period imposed on his conditional discharge. 
The language of both HRS § 712-1255 and HRS § 853-1
 
establish that the charge remains pending until the defendant
 
9In his brief, Frazer states that "[t]he Ritte court concluded that
defendant Ritte's DAG status at the time [he allegedly possessed the firearms
and ammunition] rendered him 'under indictment' for HRS § 147-7(b) purposes."
(Footnote omitted.) Frazer, however, then argues that this Ritte court
conclusion was wrong and should be revisited. 
17

successfully completes the term of probation imposed pursuant to 
the grant of a conditional discharge or deferred acceptance. Both statutes provide that the proceedings are deferred (and not terminated or ended) when the court grants a conditional discharge or a deferred acceptance and places the defendant on probation. The pending, non-final nature of the deferral granted under these statues is further shown by Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
decisions holding that the entry of an order granting a conditional discharge or a deferred acceptance and placing the defendant on probation is not a sentence or a final disposition of the case that can be appealed as a final judgment. See State 
v. Bikle, 60 Haw. 576, 580, 592 P.2d 832, 834-35 (1979); State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai
'i 309, 312-13, 22 P.3d 588, 591-92 (2001). 
Both HRS § 712-1255 and HRS § 853-1 also provide that a
 
defendant is not discharged and the proceedings against the
 defendant are not dismissed until the defendant successfully
 completes the term of probation imposed. HRS § 712-1255(2)
 provides that "[u]pon fulfillment of the terms and conditions [of
 probation], the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the
 proceedings against the person." HRS § 853-1(c) states that
 "[u]pon the defendant's completion of the period designated by
 the court and in compliance with the terms and conditions
 established, the court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss
 the charge against the defendant."
10
 
Because the conditional discharge granted to Frazer did
 
not extinguish his indicted felony charge but only deferred the
 proceedings, and because Frazer's charge remained pending while
 he was serving his probationary term, we conclude that Frazer was
 under indictment within the meaning of HRS § 134-7(b) while he
 was serving the probationary term on his conditional discharge. 
10Under both statutes, if the defendant fails to comply with the terms
of probation, the court may revoke the deferral and continue with the
proceedings by entering an adjudication of guilt. See HRS § 712-1255(1); HRS
 
§ 853-3 (2014). 
18

Therefore, Frazer was under indictment when he allegedly
 
possessed the firearm as charged in Count 2. 
The conclusion that Frazer was under indictment within 
the meaning of HRS § 134-7(b) is also compelled by the spirit and purpose of the statute and its legislative history. As discussed, the legislative history of HRS § 134-7(b) reflects the Legislature's clear purpose to increasingly expand the scope of the statute to protect the public and its recognition that "the possession of firearms or ammunition by certain categories of people raises an unacceptable risk that those items will be used for unlawful purposes." See Rapozo, 123 Hawai
'i at 340, 235 P.3d 
at 336. In 1981, the Legislature extended the statute's prohibition to a defendant under indictment for a felony. By doing so, the Legislature expressed its clear intent that all individuals under indictment for a felony, a group that includes individuals clothed with a presumption of innocence who have not admitted their guilt or been found guilty, presented an unacceptable risk and thus were prohibited from possessing a firearm or ammunition. 
If the Legislature believed that it was too dangerous
 
to permit a defendant under indictment for a felony who had not
 pleaded guilty or been found guilty to possess a firearm, it is
 difficult to see why the Legislature would intend that the grant
 of a conditional discharge and imposition of a probationary term,
 which can only be ordered after a defendant pleads guilty or is
 found guilty, would extinguish the prohibition against possessing
 a firearm. A defendant granted a conditional discharge and
 placed on probation is not acquitted, but is subject to terms and
 conditions of probation. Stated another way, if a person with a
 pending and unproven felony indictment charge is prohibited from
 possessing a firearm, then a person whose charge remains pending
 while he or she is serving the probationary term of a conditional
 discharge after pleading guilty or being found guilty must also
 be prohibited from possessing a firearm.

For these reasons, we conclude that Frazer was under
 
indictment while he was on probation pursuant to his conditional
 
discharge.11 The Circuit Court erred in dismissing Count 2 on
 
the ground that Frazer was not under indictment as alleged in
 that Count.
12
 
V.
 
The Circuit Court invoked its inherent power as an
 
alternative basis for dismissing Count 2. We conclude that the
 Circuit Court abused its discretion in doing so. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that in the absence 
of prosecutorial misconduct, a trial court does not have the inherent power to dismiss an otherwise valid indictment prior to a defendant's first trial. State v. Alvey, 67 Haw. 49, 57-58, 
676 P.2d 5, 10-11 (1984). Here, there was no allegation of prosecutorial misconduct. In addition, the Circuit Court did not determine that the indictment on Count 2 was invalid,
13 but 
rather invoked its inherent powers to dismiss Count 2 based on its belief that the State could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial that Frazer at least recklessly disregarded the risk that he was under indictment when he allegedly possessed the firearm. 
However, the Circuit Court dismissed Count 2 without
 
giving the State the opportunity to present evidence to prove its
 
11Courts from other jurisdictions have held that defendants subject to
deferred proceedings similar to that provided under HRS § 712-1255 were under
indictment for purposes of firearms statutes. See United States v. Saiz, 797
F.3d 853, 854-56 (10th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S.Ct. 1451 (2016); United
States v. Valentine, 401 F.3d 609, 616 (5th Cir. 2005); Maldonado-Mejia v.
Commonwealth, 752 S.E.2d 833, 836 (Va. 2014).
 
12We note that the Circuit Court cited the rule of lenity in support of
its ruling. However, the rule of lenity is applicable where the statutorylanguage is ambiguous and there is no guidance regarding the Legislature'sintent. State v. Kaakimaka, 84 Hawai' i 280, 292, 933 P.2d 617, 629 (1997);
United States v. Choice, 201 F.3d 837, 840 (6th Cir. 2000) (concluding thatthe rule of lenity is applicable "[i]f the statute remains ambiguous afterconsideration of its plain meaning, structure, and legislative history"). As revealed by our analysis, the conditions necessary for the application of therule of lenity are not present in this case. 
13The State presented evidence in the grand jury that Frazer possessed a
firearm while he was under indictment.
 
20

case at trial, and it erroneously relied upon the standard of
 
proof for trial in dismissing Count 2 before trial. See State v.
 
Freedle, 1 Haw. App. 396, 400, 620 P.2d 740, 743 (1980). Under
 the existing record and without knowing the full extent of the
 evidence that the State may be able to introduce at trial, we
 cannot say that the State will be unable to prove that Frazer had
 at least a reckless state of mind as to whether he was under
 indictment when he allegedly possessed the firearm as charged in
 Count 2. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Circuit
 Court abused its discretion in invoking its inherent powers to 
dismiss Count 2 before trial. 
In rendering its ruling in this case, the Circuit Court
 
expressed the view that the State could not prove its case beyond
 a reasonable doubt at trial and that the Circuit Court would have
 granted a judgment of acquittal if the case had proceeded to
 trial. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that it
 would be advisable for the case to be assigned to a different
 judge on remand.
 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Dismissal
 
Order, and we remand the case for further proceedings, before a
 different judge, consistent with this Opinion.
