IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JAYVAN CURIOSO, Defendant-Appellant
and
 
JEFFREY VALLEJOS, JONATHAN D. BAGAY, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 06-1-2226)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley and Ginoza, JJ.,
with Nakamura, C.J. concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jayvan Curioso (Curioso) appeals
 
from the May 1, 2013 "Order Granting Motion for Modification of
 
the Terms and Conditions of Probation, Deferred Acceptance of
 Guilty Plea or Deferred Acceptance of No Contest Plea," (Order to
 
Modify DAGP) entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1
 
(circuit court).
 
Curioso contends the circuit court reversibly erred by: 
(1) violating Curioso's due process rights by modifying
 
his probation conditions to include an unpaid restitution payment
 without providing him notice; and
 
(2) granting Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i's 
(State) Motion to Modify Curioso's DAGP without first inquiring

 The Honorable Judge Steven S. Alm presided. 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
into Curioso's ability to pay restitution or the time and manner
 
in which he could make such payments.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Curioso's points of error as follows:
 
In support of his contention that the circuit court 
violated his due process rights by failing to notify him that his failure to pay restitution could trigger modification of his probation, Curioso cites the following applicable law: "[a] court modifying a Defendant's probation, where no notice was previously provided to said Defendant that his original sentence might be modified at a future date, violates that Defendant's right to due process." State v. Johnson, 92 Hawai
'i 36, 986 P.2d 987 (App. 
1999). 
While the circuit court's September 7, 2011 Order of
 
Resentencing Revocation of Probation did not require Curioso to
 pay restitution, a free-standing restitution order had been
 originally imposed as a condition of deferring proceedings
 against Curioso on September 4, 2007. At that hearing, the
 circuit court informed Curioso that "because the restitution
 payment [was] a freestanding order, it [would] follow [Curioso]
 after the deferral period [was] done." Curioso thus received
 "notice" the restitution order would "follow" him beyond the
 deferral period, and the May 1, 2013 modification of the terms of
 his probation was not an abuse of discretion.
 
The circuit court is authorized to correct "[c]lerical 
mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission . . . at any time of its own initiative or on motion of any party and after such notice[.]" Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 36; see State v. Oshiro, No. CAAP-10-0000085 (Haw. App. Dec. 16, 2011) (SDO), 126 Hawai
'i 25, 265 P.3d 494 (remanding case to 
correct a clerical error that resulted in the defendant's conviction under only one subsection of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1) instead of two subsections). At the April 
26, 2013 hearing, the circuit court stated, "it appeared that for 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
some reason it [the restitution payment] wasn't ordered when
 
[Curioso] was resentenced in 2011[,]" indicating the failure to
 include the freestanding restitution payment order was the result
 of simple error.
 
We conclude the circuit court did not reversibly err by
 
requiring Curioso to pay restitution in its Order to Modify DAGP
 because the circuit court: (1) notified Curioso that the
 restitution order would extend beyond his deferral period; (2)
 included the restitution order in the initial September 4, 2007
 sentencing order; and (3) has authority to correct clerical
 errors under HRPP Rule 36.
 
Curioso cites State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai
'i 127, 890 
P.2d 1167 (1995) to support his second contention that the circuit court's failure to consider his financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time and manner of payments rendered the Order to Modify DAGP illegal. Gaylord, 78 Hawai
'i at 155, 890 P.2d at 1195 (holding the sentencing 
court's restitution order failed to comply with HRS § 706­605(1)(d) (Supp. 1992) and was illegally imposed, holding modified by State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai
'i 495, 229 P.3d 313 
(2010)). 
Gaylord interpreted HRS § 706-605, which has undergone 
substantial amendments. Before 2006, HRS § 706-605(1)(d) authorized a court to sentence a convicted defendant "([t]o make restitution in an amount the defendant can afford to pay[.]" See 
2006 Haw. Sess. Laws. Act 230 § 17 at 1007 (emphasis added). Accordingly, courts were required to make findings as to a defendant's ability to pay the amount of restitution specified in their orders under HRS § 706-605(1)(d). See Gaylord, 78 Hawai
'i 
at 152, 890 P.2d at 1192; see also State v. Werner, 93 Hawai 'i 
290, 296, 1 P.3d 760, 766 (App. 2000). It was "incumbent upon the [sentencing] court to enter into the record findings of fact and conclusions that the manner of payment is reasonable and one which [the defendant] can afford." Gaylord, 78 Hawai
'i at 153, 
890 P.2d at 1193 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The current HRS § 706-605(1) (Supp. 2013) has no such
 
clause. Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended HRS § 706-605 to

"[r]equire[] that when restitution is ordered, the amount ordered
 
not be based on the defendant's financial ability to make
 restitution but such ability may be considered in establishing
 the time and manner of payment[.]" H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 665­06 at 2 (Mar. 2, 2006) 
available at
 
www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2006/commreports/HB3256_HD1_HSCR665
 -06_.pdf.
 
HRS § 706-605(7) (Supp. 2013) incorporated language
 
from the House Standing Committee Report: 
(7) The court shall order the defendant to make
restitution for losses as provided in section 706-646. In
 
ordering restitution, the court shall not consider the
defendant's financial ability to make restitution in
determining the amount of restitution to order. The court,
however, shall consider the defendant's financial ability to
make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time
and manner of payment.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Also employing language from the House Standing
 
Committee Report, HRS § 706-646(3) (Supp. 2013) provides: 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not
consider the defendant's financial ability to make
restitution in determining the amount of restitution to
order. The court, however, shall consider the defendant's
financial ability to make restitution for the purpose of
establishing the time and manner of payment. The court
 
shall specify the time and manner in which restitution is to
be paid. Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is
 sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses,
including but not limited to:
 
(a)	 Full value of stolen or damaged property, as
determined by replacement costs of like
property, or the actual or estimated cost of
repair, if repair is possible;
 
(b)	 Medical expenses; and
 
(c)	 Funeral and burial expenses incurred as a result
of the crime.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Under current versions of HRS §§ 706-605(1), (7), and
 
706-646(3), the circuit court is authorized to impose a
 
freestanding order of restitution payment and/or as a condition
 modifying Curioso's deferral and/or probation status, but is
 required to: (1) "specify the time and manner in which
 restitution is to be paid" (HRS § 706-646(3)); and (2) "consider
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[Curioso's] financial ability to make restitution for the purpose
 
of establishing the time and manner of payment." HRS § 706­605(7). 
Curioso did not appeal from the September 4, 2007 order
 
granting his DAGP motion and imposing a freestanding restitution
 order as a condition of his deferral.
 
The circuit court's Order to Modify DAGP specified that
 
Curioso would pay restitution, jointly and severally, at a rate
 of $50 per month. 
We conclude the circuit court specified the
 
time and manner in which Curioso was to pay restitution as
 required by HRS § 706-646(3). 
At the April 26, 2013 hearing on the State's motion to
 
modify Curioso's DAGP, the circuit court inquired into whether
 Curioso had completed a drug abuse treatment program and procured
 full time employment. The circuit court's inquiry into the
 demands on Curioso's time and his employment status showed it
 considered his financial ability to make restitution payments of
 $50 a month under HRS § 706-605(7).

 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the May 1, 2013 "Order

 the First Circuit is affirmed.
