STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BARABBAS DIETRICH, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 05-1-0184)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal in CAAP-13-0001055,
 
it appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. On
 
December 9, 2011, Defendant-Appellant Barabbas Dietrich filed a
 Motion for Correction or Reduction of Sentence or Bail Pending
 Appeal, pursuant to HRPP Rule 35.  However, there is nothing in
 
the record on appeal to indicate that the circuit court ruled
 
upon the Motion for Correction or Reduction of Sentence or Bail
 Pending Appeal.

Appellant then filed an Ex-Parte Motion for Litigation
 
Expense (HRS § 802-7). The Ex-Parte Motion for Litigation
 
Expense (HRS § 802-7) was denied on April 23, 2013. Appellant
 only appeals from the denial of his Ex-Parte Motion for
 Litigation Expenses (HRS § 802-7). However, the denial of the
 Ex-Parte Motion for Litigation Expenses (HRS § 802-7) is an
 interlocutory order related to the determination of Appellant's
 December 9, 2011 Motion for Correction or Reduction of Sentence
 or Bail Pending Appeal. Because the circuit court did not enter
 a final order regarding the Motion for Correction or Reduction of
 Sentence or Bail Pending Appeal, there is no final appealable
 judgment or order pursuant to HRS § 641-11. Therefore, this
 court lacks appellate jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 21, 2013.
