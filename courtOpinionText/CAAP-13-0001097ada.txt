APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2012-182(K) (4-11-10052))
 
JANUARY 21, 2016
 
FUJISE, PRESIDING JUDGE, LEONARD AND GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
 
Claimant-Appellant Sam C. Yadao (Yadao) appeals from
 
the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (LIRAB's): 
(1) Order Denying Claimant's Motion to File After Trial, filed on
 
December 7, 2012 (December 7, 2012 Order); (2) Decision and
 
Order, filed on March 1, 2013 (Decision and Order); and (3) Order
 
Denying Motion to Reopen Record and for Reconsideration, filed on
 
May 10, 2013 (May 10, 2013 Order). 
The LIRAB concluded that Yadao (1) sustained an injury
 
to his left knee in the form of chondromalacia patella arising
 out of and in the course of his employment on August 27, 2010 and
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) did not sustain an injury to his left knee arising out of and
 
in the course of his employment on March 17, 2011. In doing so,
 the LIRAB reversed the decision of the Director of Labor and
 Industrial Relations (Director), which denied Yadao's claim for
 
worker's compensation benefits for the August 27, 2010 injury and
 
sustained worker's compensation benefits for the March 17, 2011
 injury. 
Yadao asks the Court to vacate, in part, the LIRAB's
 
Decision and Order, specifically with respect to the
 compensability of the March 17, 2011 date of injury, and find
 that Yadao sustained a personal injury arising out of and in the
 course of employment on March 17, 2011. We vacate the LIRAB's
 determination of Yadao's March 17, 2011 claim and remand for
 proceedings consistent with this order. We otherwise affirm the
 LIRAB's Decision and Order and the December 7, 2012 Order. In
 addition, we vacate the LIRAB's May 10, 2013 Order and remand for
 further proceedings, with instructions that the LIRAB consider
 the October 16, 2012 MRI report. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Yadao was employed by the State of Hawai
'i, Department 
of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR), as a Forestry Worker, on 
the island of Kaua 'i. Yadao's responsibilities included trail 
maintenance, weed whacking, and responding to forest fires. 
While performing general trail maintenance, Yadao carried a thirty to fifty pound backpack which contained water, gas, and personal protective equipment. 
On August 27, 2010, Yadao was responding to a forest 
fire on Mauna Kea, on the island of Hawai
'i (Big Island). Yadao 
was carrying a fifty-pound backpack which included a first-aid kit, fire shelter, radio, lunch, hand tools, and other forest fire-fighting gear. While walking on steep, uneven, and unstable terrain, Yadao fell and hit his left knee on a rock. Yadao continued to work after the fall. Yadao reported the injury to his supervisor on August 31, 2010. Following the August 27, 2010 injury, Yadao did not seek treatment for his left knee.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On or around September 3, 2010, Yadao filed a WC-1:
 
Employer's Report of Industrial Injury for an August 27, 2010
 
injury. Yadao claimed that he tripped and landed on his knees on
 lava rocks while "hiking to the fire line with backpack, pump and
 hand tools."
 
During the week of March 14, 2011, Yadao was performing 
maintenance on the Nualolo trail located in Koke
'e State Park on 
the island of Kaua 'i. During the week of March 14, 2011, Yadao 
worked from Monday to Thursday for four hours a day. Yadao did not work on Friday, March 18, 2011, because it was a furlough day.
1 Yadao testified that the Nualolo trail is about four 
miles. Yadao testified that the first half mile of the Nualolo trail is straight down. After the first half mile, the trail flattens out and then gradually declines. Yadao's duties that week consisted of cutting grass, brushing sides, and picking up branches off the trail. During the week of March 14, 2011, Yadao felt a pinching and poking sensation in his left knee. On March 18, 2011, Yadao felt excruciating pain in his left knee. 
On Monday, March 21, 2011, Yadao visited his primary
 
care physician, Dr. David Zimmerman (Dr. Zimmerman). In his
 
report, Dr. Zimmerman noted "left knee internal derangement." 
Dr. Zimmerman noted "very mild degenerative changes are present.
 No fracture or loose body is noted." Dr. Zimmerman referred
 Yadao to orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Richard Goding (Dr. Goding). 
Dr. Goding performed a physical examination on March
 
30, 2011. In his report dated April 4, 2011, Dr. Goding wrote
 that Yadao reported that he "fell onto both knees while he was
 fighting fire in August, and he now has pain on the medial side
 of the left knee." Dr. Goding noted severe medial joint line
 tenderness on Yadao's left knee and diagnosed Yadao with a medial

(2010). Executive order number 09–02 defined a "furlough" as "the placement
of an employee temporarily and involuntarily in a non-pay and non-duty statusby the Employer because of lack of work or funds, or other non-disciplinaryreasons." Id. at 200 n.4, 239 P.3d at 4 n.4.

meniscus tear. Dr. Goding noted "[w]e will organize an MRI and
 
see him back." 
Upon DLNR's request, Dr. Kent Davenport (Dr. Davenport)
 
performed an independent record review on July 8, 2011. Dr.
 Davenport noted his impressions as: 
1. Medial meniscus tear, left knee, unrelated to the
subject accident of 08/27/10.
2. Morbid obesity.
3. Previous history of bilateral knee pain.
 
Dr. Davenport concluded that Dr. Zimmerman's finding of
 
acute pain suggested that it was not related to the August 27,
 
2010 injury. Dr. Davenport wrote that a morbidly obese male with
 such an injury would be expected to experience severe discomfort
 within a week following the injury. Dr. Davenport concluded that
 it was not probable that Yadao sustained a meniscal tear on
 August 27, 2010.
 
Upon the request of Yadao's counsel, Dr. Wayne K.
 
Nadamoto (Dr. Nadamoto) performed a physical examination and
 
reviewed the reports of Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Goding, Dr. Sydney G.
 
Smith (Dr. Smith), and Dr. James F. Scoggin, III (Dr. Scoggin),
 
on July 9, 2012. In a report dated July 23, 2012, Dr. Nadamoto
 
diagnosed Yadao with chondromalacia2 patella3
 of the left knee
and a probable meniscus4
 tear of the left knee.  Dr. Nadamoto
 
noted that the chondromalacia patella was caused by the August
 27, 2010 fall on the patella, that Yadao continued to work
 because the symptoms were tolerable, and that the March 17, 2011
 accident was "more severe in nature" and "caused a possible tear
 of the meniscus." Dr. Nadamoto also noted that after March 17,

cartilage, most frequently in the patella." The Sloane-Dorland Annotated
 
Medical-Legal Dictionary 140 (1987).

 "Patella" is defined as a "triangular sesamoid bone, about 5 cm.
in diameter, situated at the front of the knee in the tendon of insertion of
the quadriceps extensor femoris muscle. Called also knee cap." The Sloane-
Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 535 (1987).

disk of fibrocartilage attached to the medial margin of the superior articular
surface of the tibia." The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary

2011, Yadao had "increased symptoms in the left knee and pain
 
with squatting, walking, kneeling, stair climbing and stair
 ascending or descending or prolonged standing." 
In a report dated July 20, 2011, Dr. Goding wrote that
 
Yadao's knee condition is consistent with the mechanics of the
 injury he described. Dr. Goding noted that Yadao's left knee
 condition on March 18, 2011, was related to the August 27, 2010
 injury. In a report dated January 4, 2012, Dr. Goding clarified
 that Yadao's knee condition on March 18, 2011, was clearly an
 aggravation of the August 27, 2010 injury. 
On July 20, 2011, Yadao filed a WC-5: Employee's Claim
 
for Worker's Compensation Benefits for the August 27, 2010 date
 of injury. On the same day, Yadao filed a second WC-5:
 Employee's Claim for Worker's Compensation Benefits for the March
 17, 2011 date of injury.
5 Yadao noted that "[i]t is possible the
 
March 1[7], 2011 injury is a new injury or just part of the
 August 27, 2010 injury. Preserving Claimant's rights by filing
 for the March 1[7], 2011 injury." Yadao filed both WC-5 forms
 because the insurance carrier had not paid any benefits. 
Upon receipt of Yadao's WC-5, the Department of Labor
 
and Industrial Relations requested that Yadao file a WC-1
 pursuant to HRS § 386-95 (2015). On or around July 29, 2011,
 Yadao filed a WC-1: Employer's Report of Industrial Injury for
 the March 17, 2011 injury. Yadao stated that the accident
 occurred while "performing trail maintenance the entire week on
 unleveled, hilly trails. On March 1[7], 2011, [he] felt pinching
 and poking sensation in the left knee similar to injury on August
 27, 2010." 
The Director held a hearing on August 2, 2011, to
 
determine whether Yadao sustained an injury to his left knee
 arising out of and in the course of his employment on August 27,
 2010. On September 16, 2011, the Director issued a decision
 
5
 It appears that Yadao mistakenly noted the date of injury as March
18, 2011. As mentioned previously, Yadao did not work on March 18, 2011
because it was a furlough day. The LIRAB's amended decision provides that the
correct date of accident is March 17, 2011.

denying the workers' compensation claim. The Director concluded
 
that Yadao did not sustain injury to his left knee arising out of
 and in the course of employment on August 27, 2010. The Director
 credited Dr. Richard Lewan (Dr. Lewan), Dr. Zimmerman, and Dr.
 
Davenport's reports. Yadao appealed the decision to the LIRAB. 
Upon DLNR's request, Dr. Smith performed an Independent
 
Medical Examination (IME). The IME was conducted on September
 
20, 2011 and consisted of an examination and a medical records
 
review. Dr. Smith diagnosed Yadao with "LEFT KNEE
 SYNOVITIS/EFFUSION. HISTORY OF MILD OSTEOARTHRITIS."
6 Dr. Smith
 
wrote that Yadao did not sustain a new work injury, but reported
 worsening symptoms around March 17, 2011. Dr. Smith noted that
 "[c]ertainly, the relatively heavy walking activities that Mr.
 Yadao experiences during work could result in worsening symptoms
 of a preexisting condition." Dr. Smith noted that the
 preexisting condition appeared to be non-work related. Dr. Smith
 wrote that the findings of an MRI would indicate either
 "osteoarthritis and/or a medial meniscus tear." 
Upon DLNR's request, Dr. Scoggin performed an
 
Independent Review of Medical Records on February 13, 2012. Dr.
 Scoggin reviewed the reports of Kauai Medical Clinic, West Kauai
 Clinic, Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Goding, Dr. Davenport, and Dr. Smith. 
Dr. Scoggin wrote that based on a review of the records, there is
 no clear evidence of an injury on March 17, 2011. Dr. Scoggin
 noted that the most likely clinical diagnoses is osteoarthritis
 of the left knee and degenerative medial meniscus tear of the
 left knee. Dr. Scoggin noted that the injuries on August 27,
 2010, and March 17, 2011, did not appear to be similar "since one
 involved falling on both knees and the other involved feeling a

is usually painful, particularly on motion, and is characterized by a
fluctuating swelling, due to effusion within a synovial sac." The Sloane-
Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 699 (1987). "Effusion" is defined
 
as "the escape of fluid into a part or tissue[.]" Id. at 240.
 
"Osteoarthritis" is defined as "noninflammatory degenerative joint disease
occurring chiefly in older persons, characterized by degeneration of the
articular cartilage, hypertrophy of bone at the margins, and changes in the
synovial membrane. It is accompanied by pain and stiffness, particularly
after prolonged activity." Id. at 515.

pinching and poking sensation in the left knee, without described
 
trauma." Dr. Scoggin noted that an MRI of the left knee would
 seem "reasonable and appropriate, on a non-industrial basis" or
 through Yadao's private insurance. 
The Director held a hearing on March 13, 2012, to
 
determine whether Yadao sustained an injury to his left knee
 arising out of and in the course of his employment on March 17,
 2011. In a decision filed on May 10, 2012, the Director
 concluded that Yadao sustained a compensable injury arising out
 of and in the course of his employment on March 17, 2011. The
 Director credited Dr. Goding's supplemental report dated January
 4, 2012, and claimant's testimony. The Director noted that
 "matters of average weekly wage, temporary disability, permanent
 disability and/or disfigurement, if any, shall be determined at a
 later date." The Director entered an amended decision on June 5,
 2012, correcting the date of the injury. The DLNR appealed the
 decision to the LIRAB.
 
On June 8, 2012, the DLNR filed a Motion for Stay of
 
Director's Decision filed May 10, 2012, and the amended decision
 filed on June 5, 2012. The Director denied DLNR's motion for
 stay on July 30, 2012. 
Upon DLNR's request, Dr. Clifford K.H. Lau (Dr. Lau)
 
performed an IME on August 27, 2012. The IME consisted of a
 physical examination and a records review. Dr. Lau wrote that
 Yadao's knee condition is "related to the underlying
 osteoarthritis aggravated by his morbid obesity." Dr. Lau noted
 that Yadao weighed 280 pounds and had a body mass index of forty-
four. Dr. Lau wrote that a body mass index in the mid-forties
 "would be in the extreme obese to morbidly obese range." Dr. Lau
 noted a direct correlation with obesity and degenerative
 arthritis of the knee. Dr. Lau wrote that there was no specific
 injury on or around March 17, 2011, but that Yadao may become
 symptomatic doing any type of walking up and down hills because
 of the underlying left knee osteoarthritis. Dr. Lau wrote that
 the underlying left knee osteoarthritis was not caused,
 aggravated, accelerated, or contributed to by activities on or

around March 17, 2011.
 On August 6, 2012, the LIRAB issued its pretrial order
 
setting various deadlines including a medical records submission
 
deadline of September 4, 2012 and a hearing date of October 3,
 2012. The parties stipulated and agreed to consolidate the
 appeals for the August 27, 2010 and March 17, 2011 date of injury
 claims. 
The LIRAB hearing was held on October 3, 2012. The
 
issues before the LIRAB were (1) whether Yadao sustained an
 injury to his left knee arising out of and in the course of his
 employment on August 27, 2010, and (2) whether Yadao sustained an
 injury to his left knee arising out of and in the course of his
 employment on March 17, 2011. At the hearing, the DLNR presented
 medical records from Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Goding, Dr. Davenport,
 Dr. Smith, Dr. Scoggin, and Dr. Lau. Dr. Nadamoto and Yadao
 testified at the hearing. 
Dr. Nadamoto testified that Yadao sustained
 
chondromalacia patella injury on August 27, 2010, and a meniscal
 tear on March 17, 2011. Dr. Nadamoto testified that
 chondromalacia patella is a "condition in which the normal
 tracking surface of the patella against the femur trochlea is
 disrupted to the point where it is not tracking as smoothly as it
 should." In his report, Dr. Nadamoto noted a positive McMurray
 test.
7 Dr. Nadamoto testified that a McMurray test is a test
 
used to indicate the possibility or probability of a meniscal
 injury. Dr. Nadamoto testified that sixty to seventy percent of
 people with positive McMurray tests have meniscal injuries. Dr.
 Nadamoto further explained that:
 
[T]he anatomy of the knee is that as you go up
or you step up, the femoral condyles come around and
they then roll onto the meniscal rims at the -- in the
posterior area. And then if you have a heavy load
like you're crushing down on it, it could tear it,
tear the meniscus. It's similar, although not quite
the same, you see many of those old Japanese men just
squatting in their yard. And then they get up and they

 "Sign, McMurray" is defined as the "occurrence of a cartilage
click during manipulation of the knee; indicative of a meniscal injury." The
 
Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 645 (1987).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
go doc, after I got up, you know, I felt pain. The
same idea is they roll the condyles down onto the
meniscus. And then as they come up, they're pushing up
on it and it can tear the meniscus. 
But this is even more extreme 'cause he's not
 
just squatting down. He's carrying a heavy load and
then lifting that load up elevations. 
Dr. Nadamoto testified that Yadao's thirty to 
fifty-pound pack increased the possibility of a meniscal injury. 
Dr. Nadamoto also testified that a patient's weight is a factor
 in the development of a meniscal tear. Additionally, Dr.
 Nadamoto testified that if an MRI had been taken shortly after
 the March 2011 injury, then he may have been able to determine
 whether Yadao's meniscal tear was caused by degeneration. Dr.
 Nadamoto testified that if an MRI had been taken near the October
 2012 trial date, then the MRI would likely reveal a chronic tear. 
Yadao testified that he felt a poking sensation in his
 
left knee from August 2010 to March 2011. Yadao continued to
 work after the August 27, 2010 injury because he was able to cope
 with the pain by taking Aleve. Yadao also testified that the
 pain he experienced around March 17, 2011, was in the same
 location as his August 27, 2010 injury. Yadao stated that the
 pain was located on the outside of his left knee. Yadao
 testified that after March 17, 2011, the pain in his left knee
 was excruciating. As of October 3, 2012, Yadao had not returned
 to work due to the March 2011 injury. Following Yadao's
 testimony, the LIRAB ordered the record closed except for filing
 of post-hearing briefs due December 14, 2012. 
On November 14, 2012, Yadao filed a Motion to File
 
After Trial the MRI Report of Claimant's Left Knee (Motion to
 
File After Trial). Yadao asserts that the MRI study could not be
 
performed or submitted to the LIRAB prior to the September 4,
 
2012 medical records submissions deadline and the October 3, 2012
 trial. On August 6, 2012, Dr. Goding had submitted a treatment
 plan for an MRI study of Yadao's left knee under the August 27,
 2010 injury. On August 28, 2012, DLNR denied Yadao's request for
 an MRI study of his left knee. On August 29, 2012, Dr. Goding
 submitted a new treatment plan for an MRI study of Yadao's left
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
knee under the March 17, 2011 injury. The plan was approved by
 
the DLNR on October 10, 2012. Yadao underwent an MRI on his left
 knee on October 16, 2012. The October 16, 2012 MRI report was
 not included in the Motion to File After Trial. The LIRAB denied
 Yadao's Motion to File After Trial on December 7, 2012. 
On March 1, 2013, LIRAB issued its Decision and Order. 
The LIRAB's Findings of Fact (FOFs) and Conclusions of Law (COLs)
 
included, inter alia:
 
[FOF 25]: The Board finds that Employer has not
presented substantial evidence to overcome the presumption
of compensability with regard to the August 27, 2010 left
knee chondromalacia patella work injury. 
[FOF 26]: The Board finds that Claimant sustained a
chondromalacia patella injury to his left knee as a result
of the August 27, 2010 work injury, as diagnosed by Dr.
Nadamoto. 
[FOF 27]: The Board finds, however that Employer has
presented substantial evidence to overcome the presumption
of compensability with regard to the March 17, 2011 injury. 
[FOF 28]: The Board finds that Claimant's symptoms
around March 17, 2011 continued to be attributable to the
August 27, 2010 work injury. Claimant testified that the
 symptoms were in the same location. According to Dr.
Nadamoto's testimony, Claimant would have had symptoms in a
different location of his left knee if he had sustained a
 medial meniscal tear of his left knee. 
. . . .
 
[COL 1]: The Board concludes that Claimant sustained
an injury to his left knee in the form of chondromalacia
patella arising out of and in the course of his employment
on August 27, 2010. 
[COL 2]: The Board concludes that Claimant did not
sustain an injury to his left knee arising out of and in the
course of his employment on March 17, 2011. 
On March 19, 2013, Yadao filed a Motion to Reopen
 
Record and for Reconsideration with LIRAB. In the motion, Yadao
 
requested that the LIRAB reopen the record, receive the October
 16, 2012 MRI report and, if necessary, further testimony from Dr.
 Nadamoto. Yadao also requested that the LIRAB reconsider its
 Decision and Order. Yadao argued that the October 16, 2012 MRI
 report constituted clear and convincing evidence that he
 sustained a torn medial meniscal tear. The MRI report was
 attached to the Motion to Reopen Record and for Reconsideration. 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the MRI report, the impressions are noted as "1. BONE BRUISE
 
MEDIAL FEMORAL CONDYLE. 2. PROBABLE PARTIAL TEAR OF THE LATERAL
 COLLATERAL LIGAMENT. 3. LARGE TEAR OF THE POSTERIOR HORN OF THE
 MEDIAL MENISCUS." 
On April 18, 2013, DLNR filed a memorandum in
 
opposition, contending that Yadao had not presented new evidence
 that could not have been presented at trial. DLNR argued that
 Yadao could have obtained the MRI under his private insurance
 prior to the September 4, 2012 medical report submissions
 deadline and the October 3, 2012 trial. DLNR also argued that
 Yadao should not be allowed to submit additional expert testimony
 from Dr. Nadamoto. 
On May 9, 2013, the LIRAB heard arguments on Yadao's
 
Motion to Reopen the Record and for Reconsideration, took the
 matter under advisement, and then issued an order denying Yadao's
 motion on the following day. The LIRAB did not provide its
 reasons for denying Yadao's motion in its May 10, 2013 Order. 
Yadao timely filed a notice of appeal on May 24, 2013.
 
II.	 POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL
 
Yadao raises the following points of error: 
(1) The LIRAB erred in crediting the opinions of Dr.
 
Smith, in FOF 19,  8
 where Dr. Smith's opinion failed to explain
the objective signs of a meniscus tear he recognized might be
 shown by an MRI; 
(2) The LIRAB erred in crediting the opinion of Dr.
 
Scoggin, in FOF 20,
9
 where Dr. Scoggin did not examine Yadao and
failed to explain why the work duties Yadao described to him
 would not be a cause for a meniscus tear;
 
(3)
 The LIRAB erred in crediting the opinion of Dr.
 
Lau, in FOF 21, where Dr. Lau's opinion ignored the positive
 McMurray Test as objective evidence of a tear and the work
 activities associated with a tear;
 
8
 FOF 19 in the LIRAB's Decision and Order refers to Dr. Scoggin's
report. It appears that Yadao intended to cite to FOF 17.

 FOF 20 in the Decision and Order refers to Dr. Nadamoto's
 
testimony. It appears that Yadao intended to cite to FOF 19. 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) The LIRAB erred, in FOF 27, in finding that the
 
DLNR had presented substantial evidence to overcome the
 
presumption of compensability with regard to the March 17, 2011
 injury;
 
(5) The LIRAB erred, in FOF 28, in finding that Yadao's
 
symptoms around March 17, 2011, were attributable to his August
 27, 2010 chondromalacia patella injury to his left knee;
 
(6) The LIRAB erred, in COL 2, in concluding that Yadao
 
did not sustain an injury to his left knee arising out of and in
 the course of his employment on March 17, 2011; and
 
(7) The LIRAB erred in not reopening the record to
 
receive the MRI report published after the close of the hearing
 as requested by Yadao both prior to the LIRAB's Decision and
 Order and after the Decision and Order. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS
§ 91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
We have previously stated: 
FOFs are reviewable under the clearly erroneous
standard to determine if the agency decision was
clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and

A COL that presents mixed questions of fact and
law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard
because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. When mixed
 questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate
court must give deference to the agency's expertise
and experience in the particular field. The court
 should not substitute its own judgment for that of the
agency.

An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial
evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2)
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We have
 defined "substantial evidence" as credible evidence which is
 of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

[An appellate court] generally reviews questions of
statutory interpretation de novo, but, in the case of
ambiguous statutory language, the applicable standard
of review regarding an agency's interpretation of its
own governing statute requires [courts] to defer to
the agency's expertise and to follow the agency's
construction of the statute unless that construction
 is palpably erroneous[.]

General principles of statutory construction apply in
interpreting administrative rules. As in statutory
construction, courts look first at an administrative
rule's language. If an administrative rule's language
is unambiguous, and its literal application is neither
inconsistent with the policies of the statute the rule
implements nor produces an absurd or unjust result,
courts enforce the rule's plain meaning.

A. The LIRAB did not err in FOF 17 (Dr. Smith) 
Yadao argues that the LIRAB erred in crediting the 
opinions of Dr. Smith because Dr. Smith's opinion failed to explain the objective signs of a meniscus tear he recognized might be shown by an MRI. "FOFs are reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard to determine if the agency decision was clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record." Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i at 406, 38 P.3d 
at 574 (citations and brackets omitted). 
It is well established that :
 
courts decline to consider the weight of the evidence to
ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative
findings, or to review the agency's findings of fact by
passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in
testimony, especially the findings of an expert agency
dealing with a specialized field. 
Id. at 409-10, 38 P.3d at 577-78 (quoting In re Hawaiian Elec. 
Co., Inc., 81 Hawai 'i 459, 465, 918 P.2d 561, 567 (1996)). In a 
worker's compensation case, the "credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai
'i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 
16, 22 (2001) (citation omitted).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As stated in his report, Dr. Smith diagnosed Yadao with
 
"LEFT KNEE SYNOVITIS/EFFUSION. HISTORY OF MILD OSTEOARTHRITIS." 
Dr. Smith wrote that the findings of an MRI would indicate either
 "osteoarthritis and/or a medial meniscus tear." At trial, Yadao
 questioned Dr. Nadamoto about Dr. Smith's report. Dr. Nadamoto
 
testified that Dr. Smith did not indicate whether he performed a
 
McMurray test. Dr. Nadamoto testified that a McMurray test is a
 test used to indicate the possibility or probability of a
 meniscal injury and that sixty to seventy percent of people with
 positive McMurray tests have meniscal injuries. Dr. Nadamoto
 further testified that Dr. Smith found tenderness of the medial
 line joint which is consistent with but not the same as a
 McMurray test.
 
The LIRAB does not specifically "credit" Dr. Smith's
 
opinion. FOF 17 merely reiterates Dr. Smith's report. 
Furthermore, it was within LIRAB's discretion to decide what
 weight to give Dr. Smith's report and Dr. Nadamoto's testimony. 
We decline to disturb LIRAB's assessment of the credibility of
 the witnesses and the weight it gives to the evidence. To the
 extent that it did so, we cannot conclude that the LIRAB erred in
 crediting the opinion of Dr. Smith. 
B. The LIRAB did not err in FOF 19 (Dr. Scoggin) 
Yadao argues that the LIRAB erred in crediting the
 
opinion of Dr. Scoggin because Dr. Scoggin did not examine Yadao
 and failed to explain why the work duties Yadao described to him
 would not be a cause for a meniscus tear. 
Dr. Scoggin performed an independent review of medical
 
records on February 23, 2012, and reviewed the reports of Kauai
 Medial Clinic, West Kauai Clinic, Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Goding, Dr.
 Davenport, and Dr. Smith. Dr. Scoggin reported that the most
 likely clinical diagnoses are osteoarthritis of the left knee and
 degenerative medial meniscus tear of the left knee. Dr. Scoggin
 noted, inter alia, that an MRI of the left knee would seem
 "reasonable and appropriate, on a non-industrial basis" or
 through Yadao's private insurance. At the evidentiary hearing,
 Yadao questioned Dr. Nadamoto about Dr. Scoggin's degenerative
 
15
   
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
medial meniscus tear diagnosis. Dr. Nadamoto testified that
 
"once you get chondromalacia, that is by definition a form of
 arthritis, early, mild." Dr. Nadamoto testified that if an MRI
 had been taken shortly after the March 17, 2011 injury, then he
 may have been able to determine whether Yadao's meniscal tear was
 caused by degeneration. 
The LIRAB does not, in FOF 19, specifically "credit"
 
Dr. Scoggin's opinion. It was nevertheless within LIRAB's
 discretion to decide what weight to give Dr. Scoggin's report and
 Dr. Nadamoto's testimony. We decline to disturb LIRAB's
 assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight it
 gives to the evidence. Based on the record in this case, we
 cannot conclude that the LIRAB erred in crediting the opinion of
 Dr. Scoggin, in FOF 19.
 
C. The LIRAB did not err in FOF 21 (Dr. Lau)
 Yadao argues that the LIRAB erred in crediting the
 
opinion of Dr. Lau because Dr. Lau's opinion ignored the positive
 McMurray Test as objective evidence of a tear and the work
 activities associated with a tear. 
Dr. Lau performed an IME on August 27, 2012, which
 
consisted of a physical examination and a records review. Dr.
 
Lau reported that Yadao's knee condition was "related to the
 
underlying osteoarthritis aggravated by his morbid obesity." 
Dr. Lau wrote that there was no specific injury on or around
 
March 17, 2011, but that Yadao may become symptomatic doing any
 type of walking up and down hills because of the underlying left
 knee osteoarthritis. Dr. Lau opined that the underlying left
 knee osteoarthritis was not caused, aggravated, accelerated, or
 contributed to by activities on or around March 17, 2011. 
Again, the LIRAB does not specifically "credit" Dr.
 
Lau's opinion; rather, FOF 21 merely reiterates Dr. Lau's report. 
It was within LIRAB's discretion to decide what weight to give
 Dr. Lau's report. We again decline to disturb LIRAB's assessment
 of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight it gives to
 the evidence. Based on the record here, we cannot conclude that
 the LIRAB erred in crediting the opinion of Dr. Lau.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. The LIRAB's FOF 27 and FOF 28 are clearly erroneous
 
Yadao challenges FOF 27 and FOF 28 in the LIRAB's
 
Decision and Order.10 In FOF 27, the LIRAB found that the DLNR
 
had presented substantial evidence to overcome the presumption of
 compensability with regard to the March 17, 2011 injury. In FOF
 28, the LIRAB found that Yadao's symptoms around March 17, 2011,
 were attributable to his August 27, 2010 work injury. 
In determining compensability of injuries by accident 
under the workers' compensation statutes, the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court has applied the "unitary" or "nexus" test. Van Ness v. 
State of Haw., Dep't. of Educ., 131 Hawai 'i 545, 560, 319 P.3d 
464, 479 (2014) (citing Flor v. Holguin, 94 Hawai 'i 70, 80, 9 
P.3d 382, 392 (2000)). This unitary test requires the "finding of a causal connection between the injury and any incidents or conditions of employment." Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co., 77 
Hawai
'i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 1246, 1249 (1994) (citing Chung v. 
Animal Clinic, Inc., 63 Haw. 642, 648, 636 P.2d 721, 725 (1981)). The unitary requirement is set forth in HRS § 386-3(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014), which provides: 
If an employee suffers personal injury either by accident
arising out of and in the course of the employment or by
disease proximately caused by or resulting from the nature
of the employment, the employee's employer or the special
compensation fund shall pay compensation to the employee or
the employee's dependents[.]
 
(Emphasis added). 
Pursuant to HRS § 386-85 (2015), "it shall be presumed, 
in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . 
[t]hat the claim is for a covered work injury[.]" The presumption "imposes upon the employer the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion." Van 
Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 P.3d at 477 (citing Akamine v. 
Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 53 Haw. 406, 408, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972)). The employer may overcome the presumption "only [with] substantial evidence that [the injury] is unrelated to 
10
 Yadao's fourth and fifth points of error are related; thus, we
address them together.
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
employment." Akamine, 53 Haw. at 408, 495 P.3d at 1166. The 
term "substantial evidence" "signifies a high quantum of evidence 
which, at the minimum, must be 'relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable [person] that an injury or death is not work connected.'" Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai
'i 263, 267-68, 47 P.3d 
730, 734-35 (2002) (quoting Flor v. Holguin, 94 Hawai 'i 70, 79, 9 
P.3d 382, 391 (2000)). If the employer is unable to produce this "substantial evidence," then the presumption requires that the claimant prevail. Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 P.3d at 477; 
Akamine, 53 Haw. at 409, 495 P.2d at 1166. 
The supreme court has recognized that the high burden 
placed on the employer is consistent with the purpose of the workers' compensation law. Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 
P.3d at 477. "[T]he legislature has decided that work injuries are among the costs of production which industry is required to bear; and if there is reasonable doubt as to whether an injury is work-connected, the humanitarian nature of the statute demands that doubt be resolved in favor of the claimant." Korsak v. Haw. 
Permanente Med. Grp., 94 Hawai
'i 297, 307, 12 P.3d 1238, 1248 
(2000) (citing Akamine, 53 Haw. at 409, 495 P.2d at 1166). 
With regard to a claim for compensation due to an 
alleged compensable consequence of a work-related injury, HRS § 386-85 creates a presumption in favor of the claimant that the subsequent injury is causally related to the primary injury. Korsak, 94 Hawai
'i at 307, 12 P.3d at 1248. The supreme court 
has recognized that: "Generally, 'a subsequent injury, whether an aggravation of the original injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable if it is the direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury.' 1 A. Larson, The Law of Worker's Compensation § 13.11, at 3–503 (1993)." Davenport v. City & Cnty 
of Honolulu, 100 Hawai
'i 297, 310, 59 P.3d 932, 945 (App. 2001) 
(quoting Diaz v. Oahu Sugar Co., 77 Hawai 'i 152, 155, 883 P.2d 
73, 76 (1994)). The test for determining whether a subsequent injury is a direct and natural result of the original compensable injury is: "(1) whether any causal connection exists between the 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
original and subsequent injury; and, if so, (2) whether the cause 
of the subsequent injury is attributable to some activity that would be customary in light of the claimant's condition." Diaz, 77 Hawai
'i at 156, 883 P.2d at 77. 
Furthermore, the supreme court has recognized that 
"generalized" medical testimony concerning the cause of an injury is insufficient to rebut the presumption of compensability. Nakamura, 98 Hawai
'i at 268, 47 P.3d at 735 (citing Akamine, 53 
Haw. at 410-12, 495 P.2d at 1167-68). In Akamine, the claimant collapsed while pushing a hand truck at work. Akamine, 53 Haw. 
at 407, 495 P.2d at 1165. One of the experts testified that there was no connection between claimant's death and employment based on his belief that "heart diseases originate early in life and that [claimant's] pre-existing pathological condition was the sole cause of death." Id. at 410-11, 495 P.2d at 1167. The 
supreme court held that the employer had failed to present substantial evidence to overcome the presumption that a causal connection existed between claimant's death and employment activity. Id. at 414, 495 P.2d at 1169. The supreme court noted 
that: 
To allow a medical expert to give his opinion as to
whether legal causation existed in a particular case
could lead to an unjust result. For a medical man may
give a generalized opinion that there was no
connection between an incident at work and a heart
 attack, and, in his own mind, may mean thereby that a
pre-existing pathological condition was the
overwhelming factor in bringing about the attack and
that the part played by the work was insignificant.
But, while it may be sound medically to say that the
work did not cause the attack, it may be bad law,
because, an [sic] general, existing law treats the
slightest factor of aggravation as an adequate cause.
 
Id. at 410, 495 P.2d at 1167 (emphasis added; citations and
 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
Since Akamine, the supreme court has held that "the 
slightest aggravation or acceleration of an injury by the employment activity mandates compensation." Van Ness, 131 
Hawai
'i at 562, 319 P.3d at 481 (citing De Fries v. Ass'n of 
Owners, 999 Wilder, 57 Haw. 296, 309, 555 P.2d 855, 862 (1976) (holding that claimant was entitled to recover for injuries 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resulting from a stumble that aggravated or accelerated the
 
arthritic condition of his knee)). In Van Ness, claimant alleged
 that the aggravation of his asthma resulting from exposure to
 volcanic smog (vog) at his place of employment was a compensable
 
injury by disease. Id. at 559, 319 P.3d at 478. The supreme
 
court noted that the employer had failed to present substantial
 
evidence to overcome the presumption that the aggravation of
 claimant's asthma was an injury "by disease proximately caused
 by" his employment. Id. at 565, 319 P.3d at 484. The supreme
 
court held that the aggravation of claimant's asthma was causally
 connected to the "incidents or conditions" of his employment and
 therefore compensable under the workers' compensation statutes. 
Id. at 564, 319 P.3d at 483 (citing Chung v. Animal Clinic, Inc.,
 63 Haw. 642, 648, 636 P.2d 721, 725 (1981)).
 As a threshold matter, the LIRAB's finding that Yadao 
had sustained a chondromalacia patella injury on August 27, 2010 was not challenged by either Yadao or DLNR. Therefore, that fact is binding upon the appellate court. State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai
'i 
494, 502, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012). 
The LIRAB found, in effect, that Yadao sustained a
 
primary compensable injury on August 27, 2010. Once a primary
 compensable injury is found, HRS § 386-85 created a presumption
 that the subsequent injury is causally related to the primary
 injury. Thus, it is presumed that Yadao's March 17, 2011 claim
 is compensable if it is the direct and natural result of the
 primary injury. This presumption will hold regardless of whether
 the March 17, 2011 claim is for a new injury or an aggravation of
 the primary injury. The DLNR may overcome the presumption only
 with substantial evidence that the March 17, 2011 claim is
 unrelated to Yadao's employment. 
There is evidence in the record that Yadao's employment
 
with DLNR involved strenuous activity. During the week of March
 14, 2011, Yadao was performing trail maintenance for
 approximately four hours a day on the Nualolo trail, including
 cutting grass, brushing sides, and picking up branches off the
 trail. Yadao carried a thirty- to fifty-pound backpack while
 
20
  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
performing trail maintenance. 
Additionally, Dr. Nadamoto explained his meniscal tear
 
diagnosis at the hearing. Dr. Nadamoto stated: 
Now, the anatomy of the knee is that as you go
up or you step up, the femoral condyles come around
and they then roll onto the meniscal rims at the -- in
the posterior area. And then if you have a heavy load
like you're crushing down on it, it could tear it,
tear the meniscus. It's similar, although not quite
the same, you see many of those old Japanese men just
squatting in their yard. And then they get up and
they go doc, after I got up, you know, I felt pain.
The same idea is they roll the condyles down onto the
meniscus. And then as they come up, they're pushing
up on it and it can tear the meniscus.
But this is even more extreme 'cause he's not
 
just squatting down. He's carrying a heavy load and
then lifting that load up elevations. 
The DLNR argues that it presented "substantial,
 
credible and persuasive evidence to show that [Yadao's] work
 
activities on or about March 17, 2011 did not cause, aggravate,
 or accelerate his left knee condition." The evidence offered by
 DLNR to rebut the statutory presumption included Dr. Smith and
 Dr. Lau's opinions. Dr. Smith wrote, however, that Yadao's heavy
 walking activities at work could result in the worsening symptoms
 of a preexisting condition. Dr. Smith also noted that the
 preexisting condition appeared to be non-work related. Dr. Lau
 
opined that Yadao's left knee condition was related to underlying
 
osteoarthritis aggravated by his morbid obesity. Dr. Lau noted
 that Yadao may become "symptomatic doing any type of walking up
 and down hills because of the underlying osteoarthritis of his
 left knee." Dr. Lau summarily concluded that the underlying left
 knee osteoarthritis was not caused, aggravated, accelerated, or
 contributed to by activities on or around March 17, 2011.
 
Dr. Smith and Dr. Lau's reports constitute generalized 
opinions that Yadao's employment activity worsened a preexisting non-work related condition. Such "generalized" medical opinions concerning the cause of an injury are insufficient to rebut the presumption of compensability. Nakamura, 98 Hawai
'i at 268, 47 
P.3d at 735 (citing Akamine, 53 Haw. at 410-12, 495 P.2d at 1167­68). "The primary focus of the medical testimony should have been a discussion on whether the employment effort, whether great 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or little, in any way aggravated" Yadao's left knee condition. 
Akamine, 53 Haw. at 412, 495 P.2d at 1168. The existing law treats the slightest aggravation or acceleration of an injury as adequate cause. Id. at 410, 495 P.2d at 1167. The LIRAB failed 
to make any findings with respect to whether Yadao's employment activity aggravated or accelerated his left knee condition. Nevertheless, "doubt as to the cause of the injury represents a salient index of the absence of substantial evidence required to overcome the presumption that the claim is compensable." Van 
Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 564, 319 P.3d at 483 (citing Akamine, 53 
Haw. at 414, 495 P.2d at 1169) (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the DLNR did not present substantial evidence that Yadao's March 17, 2011 injury was unrelated to his employment. As such, the LIRAB's FOF 27 is clearly erroneous. 
In FOF 28, the LIRAB found that Yadao's symptoms around
 
March 17, 2011, continued to be attributable to his August 27,
 2010 injury. The LIRAB compared Yadao's testimony that his
 symptoms were in the same location with Dr. Nadamoto's testimony
 that Yadao would have had symptoms in a different location if he
 sustained a meniscal tear. However, the LIRAB failed to consider
 the entirety of the record. Although Yadao testified that the
 pain he experienced around March 17, 2011, was in the same
 location as the August 27, 2010 injury, there is support in the
 record to indicate that the pain of the March 17, 2011 injury was
 more severe. Dr. Nadamoto explained that the difference between
 chondromalacia patella symptoms and meniscus tear symptoms would
 be the location and severity of pain. Yadao testified that he
 had been able to cope with the pain from the August 27, 2010
 injury by taking Aleve, but that after March 17, 2011, the pain
 in his left knee was excruciating. 
22
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As of October 3, 2012, Yadao had not returned to work due to the
 
March 17, 2011 injury.11
 
Based on the LIRAB's conclusion that Yadao did not 
sustain a compensable injury on March 17, 2011, the LIRAB presumably found that Yadao's symptoms around March 17, 2011, were a continuation of the August 27, 2010 injury. The LIRAB further determined that Yadao's March 17, 2011 injury was not a compensable consequence of his primary August 27, 2010 injury. However, this determination is based on the flawed belief that the DLNR presented substantial evidence to rebut the presumption of compensability. On the contrary, the DLNR failed to present substantial evidence that the March 17, 2011 claim is unrelated to Yadao's employment activity. In our view, there is reasonable doubt as to whether Yadao's employment activity aggravated or accelerated his left knee condition. We recognize that when there is "reasonable doubt as to whether an injury is work-connected, the humanitarian nature of the statute demands that doubt be resolved in favor of the claimant." Korsak, 94 
Hawai
'i at 307, 12 P.3d at 1248 (citing Akamine, 53 Haw. at 409, 
495 P.2d at 1166). We conclude that the LIRAB's FOF 28 was clearly erroneous. 
E. The LIRAB's COL 2 was wrong
 Yadao challenges COL 2 in the LIRAB's Decision and
 
Order, wherein the LIRAB concluded that Yadao did not sustain an
 injury to his left knee arising out of and in the course of his
 employment on March 17, 2011. 
It appears that FOF 27 and FOF 28 served as the basis
 
for its conclusion that Yadao did not sustain a compensable
 injury on March 17, 2011. As we have concluded that FOF 27 and
 FOF 28 are clearly erroneous, COL 2 is wrong and LIRAB's Decision
 and Order as to its determination on the compensability of the
 March 17, 2011 date of injury must be vacated and remanded for
 further proceedings.

 The record includes a report that Yadao eventually returned to his
"regular duties in October 2013, working full-time without job modification."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
F.	 The LIRAB abused its discretion when it denied Yadao's
 
Motion to Reopen Record and for Reconsideration
 
Yadao argues that the LIRAB erred when it denied his
 
Motion to File After Trial and Motion to Reopen Record and for
 
Reconsideration. Yadao's Motion to File After Trial was filed
 prior to the LIRAB's Decision and Order. However, Yadao's Motion
 to Reopen Record and for Reconsideration was filed after the
 LIRAB's Decision and Order. 
In the Motion to File After Trial, Yadao requested 
leave to file an MRI report after the medical submissions deadline. Hawai
'i Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-22 (West 
2015) provides that the LIRAB "may enter a pretrial order" establishing discovery deadlines. A medical submission deadline is the date that all medical reports or records shall be filed with the LIRAB. HAR § 12-47-22(b)(3). The LIRAB has wide discretion to control the admission or exclusion of evidence. 
The [LIRAB] shall not be bound by statutory and common
law rules relating to the admission or rejection of
evidence. The [LIRAB] may exercise its own discretion
in these matters, limited only by considerations of
relevancy, materiality, and repetition, by the rules
of privilege recognized by law, and with a view to
securing a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination
of the proceedings.
 
HAR § 12-47-41 (West 2015). This court has previously
 
recognized, in unpublished decisions, that the LIRAB's
 evidentiary rulings should be upheld absent an abuse of
 discretion. See Tautua v. BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co., No. 30291,
 
2012 WL 2308162 (Haw. App. June 18, 2012) (SDO); Athens v. Int'l
 Archaeological Research Inst., Inc., No. 29495, 2011 WL 5997078
 (Haw. App. Nov. 30, 2011) (SDO); Sugano v. State Dep't of
 Attorney Gen., No. 29246, 2010 WL 231100 (Haw. App. Jan. 22,
 2010) (SDO). 
We conclude that it was within the LIRAB's discretion
 
to exclude untimely discovery in this case. In its pretrial
 order, the LIRAB set the medical records submission deadline of
 September 4, 2012. At the end of hearing, the LIRAB closed the
 record except for the filing of post-trial memorandums. Yadao
 argues that he was not able to submit the MRI report prior to the
 
24
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
medical submission deadline and hearing because DLNR did not
 
approve the MRI treatment plan until October 10, 2012. Although
 Yadao provided a reasonable explanation for the untimely MRI
 report, nevertheless, we cannot conclude that the LIRAB "clearly
 exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles
 of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
 litigant." Amfac, 74 Haw. at 114, 839 P.2d at 26. 
However, in his Motion to Reopen Record and for
 
Reconsideration, Yadao again requested that the LIRAB reopen the
 record, receive the October 16, 2012 MRI report, and if
 necessary, further testimony from Dr. Nadamoto. Yadao further
 
requested that the LIRAB reconsider its Decision and Order. 
The LIRAB's ruling on a motion to reopen the record is 
governed by HAR § 12-47-41. The LIRAB's ruling on a motion for 
reconsideration is governed by HAR § 12-47-53 (West 2015)
12 and 
HRS § 386-87(d)(2015). HRS § 386-87(d) states in relevant part, "the [LIRAB] may, upon the application of the director or any other party . . . reopen the matter and thereupon may take further evidence or may modify its findings, conclusions or decisions." In Bocalbos, this court noted that the term "may" implies discretion on the part of the LIRAB. Bocalbos, 93 
Hawai
'i at 126, 997 P.2d at 52. As such, a motion for 
reconsideration by the LIRAB is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. The appellate courts have recognized that: 
[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow
the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that
could not have been presented [in an] earlier adjudicated
motion. Reconsideration is not a device to relitigate old
matters or to raise arguments or evidence that could and
should have been brought during the earlier proceeding. 
12
 HAR § 12-47-53 states, in relevant part: 
(a) In the absence of an appeal and within thirty days
after mailing of a copy of the board's decision or
order, the board may, upon the request of any party,
or upon its own motion, reconsider or reopen the
matter. If reopening is allowed, the board may take
further evidence or may modify its decision or order.

Sousaris v. Miller, 92 Hawai 'i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
DLNR contends that Yadao has not presented new evidence 
or arguments to support his request to reopen the record and for 
reconsideration, asserting that Yadao could have obtained the MRI under his private insurance prior to the September 4, 2012 medical report submissions deadline and the October 3, 2012 trial. However, the fact that the MRI report violated the medical reports submission deadline is not dispositive of Yadao's request to "take further evidence or [to] modify its findings, conclusion or decisions as allowed by HRS § 386-87(d)(1985)." Bocalbos, 93 Hawai
'i at 127 n.27, 997 P.2d at 53 n.27 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Yadao provided a reasonable explanation for the
 
delay in obtaining the MRI study of his left knee. On August 6,
 2012, Dr. Goding submitted a treatment plan for an MRI study of
 Yadao's left knee under the August 27, 2010 injury claim. The
 DLNR denied Yadao's request for an MRI study of his left knee on
 August 28, 2012. On August 29, 2012, Dr. Goding submitted a new
 
treatment plan for an MRI study of Yadao's left knee under the
 
March 17, 2011 injury claim. The plan was approved by DLNR on
 October 10, 2012. Accordingly, DLNR's argument that the MRI
 report does not constitute new evidence because it could have
 been obtained prior to the medical submissions deadline is not
 convincing. 
The central issue at the October 3, 2012 hearing was
 
whether Yadao sustained an injury to his left knee arising out of
 and in the course of his employment on March 17, 2011. The
 evidence presented at the hearing consisted of medical reports
 and testimony. The record indicates that Dr. Goding, Dr. Smith,
 Dr. Scoggin, and Dr. Nadamoto recognized the importance of an
 MRI. In a report dated April 4, 2011, Dr. Goding noted severe
 medial joint line tenderness on Yadao's left knee and diagnosed
 Yadao with a medial meniscus tear. Dr. Goding noted "[w]e will
 organize an MRI and see him back." Dr. Smith wrote that the
 findings of an MRI would indicate either "osteoarthritis and/or a
 
26
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
medial meniscus tear." Dr. Scoggin noted that an MRI of the left
 
knee would seem "reasonable and appropriate, on a non-industrial
 basis" or through Yadao's private insurance. 
At the hearing, Dr. Nadamoto testified that Yadao
 
sustained chondromalacia patella injury on August 27, 2010 and a
 meniscal tear on March 17, 2011. Yadao's positive McMurray test
 supported Dr. Nadamoto's meniscal tear diagnosis. Dr. Nadamoto
 testified that if an MRI had been taken shortly after the March
 2011 injury, then he may have been able to determine whether
 Yadao's meniscal tear was caused by degeneration and that if an
 MRI had been taken near the October 2012 trial date, then the MRI
 would likely reveal a chronic tear. Based on the evidence
 presented at the hearing, the LIRAB concluded that Yadao had not
 sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of his
 employment on March 17, 2011. 
In reaching its conclusion, the LIRAB clearly declined
 
to find that Yadao had sustained a meniscal tear injury on March
 17, 2011. Yadao asserts that the MRI report presents important
 new evidence. The MRI report notes impressions as "1. BONE
 BRUISE MEDIAL FEMORAL CONDYLE. 2. PROBABLE PARTIAL TEAR OF THE
 LATERAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT. 3. LARGE TEAR OF THE POSTERIOR HORN
 OF THE MEDIAL MENISCUS." Thus, the MRI report constitutes
 objective evidence of a meniscal tear injury that reasonably
 could not have been presented at the original hearing. 
Despite the significance of the MRI report to the 
LIRAB's determination, the LIRAB provides no explanation for denying the Motion to Reopen and for Reconsideration. Although the LIRAB has wide discretion in managing evidence, the equities of this case, and the overriding purpose of Hawai
'i's workers' 
compensation scheme, required the LIRAB to reopen the record and consider the MRI report. We conclude that the LIRAB abused its discretion when it denied Yadao's Motion to Reopen Record and for Reconsideration. Therefore, we vacate the LIRAB's May 10, 2013 Order and remand for further proceedings, including that the LIRAB consider the MRI report.

V. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate (1) the LIRAB's
 
determination of Yadao's March 17, 2011 claim and (2) the LIRAB's
 
May 10, 2013 Order; we remand this case for further proceedings
 consistent with this Opinion. In all other respects, we affirm
 the LIRAB's Decision and Order and the December 7, 2012 Order.
