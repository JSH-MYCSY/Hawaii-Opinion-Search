SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Simbralynn Kanaka 'ole (Kanaka 'ole)1 
appeals from the Judgment entered by the District Court of the
 
Third Circuit (District Court)2
 on December 5, 2012, in 
3DTA-08-02625, 3DTA-10-01865, 3DTC-08-023033, 3DTC-08-024235,
 3DTC-10-004141, 3DTC-10-005190, 3DTC-10-005772, and 
3DTC-10-025081. Kanaka
'ole was convicted of six counts of 
driving without a license, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 286-102 (2007); three counts of driving without
 no-fault insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104 (2005); and

times as "Simbralynn Kanaka 'ole-Esperon."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
two counts of failure to appear, in violation of HRS § 803-6(e)
 
(1993 & Supp. 2007). 
In the District Court, Kanaka 'ole moved to dismiss the 
charges. She asserted that she was a subject of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i, that she was cited in the Kingdom of Hawai 'i, and that 
the District Court lacked jurisdiction over her cases. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, and Kanaka
'ole 
entered conditional pleas of no contest on all the charges. Based on her pleas, the District Court found Kanaka
'ole guilty 
and sentenced her to various fines and assessments. 
I.
 
On appeal, Kanaka 'ole argues that the District Court 
lacked jurisdiction over her cases because the Hawaiian Kingdom continues to exist and she is a subject of the Hawaiian Kingdom. We conclude that Kanaka
'ole's argument is foreclosed by decisions 
of the Hawai 'i Supreme Court and this court. State v. Kaulia, 
128 Hawai 'i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013); State v. Fergerstrom, 106 
Hawai'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai 'i 
41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). 
In Kaulia, the defendant, Dennis Kaulia, contended that 
"the courts of the State of Hawai 'i lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction over his criminal prosecution because the defense proved the existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom and the illegitimacy of the State of Hawai
'i government." Kaulia, 128 Hawai 'i at 486­
87, 291 P.3d at 384-85. The supreme court rejected Kaulia's claim. Id. The supreme court ruled as follows: 
Kaulia appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the
Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm that"[w]hatever may be said regarding the lawfulness" of itsorigins, "the State of Hawai' i . . . is now, a lawful
government." State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 43, 55, 101
P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004), aff'd, 106 Hawai' i 41, 101 P.3d
225 (2004). Individuals claiming to be citizens of theKingdom and not of the State are not exempt from applicationof the State's laws. See id. at 55, 101 P.3d at 664; State 
v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai' i 219, 883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994); State 
v. French, 77 Hawai' i 222, 883 P.2d 644 (App. 1994);
Nishitani v. Baker, 82 Hawai' i 281, 921 P.2d 1182 (App.
1996); State v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 130, 976 P.2d 444 (1999). 
Thus we also reject Kaulia's argument that the circuit

court erred in precluding Kaulia from calling a witness to
present evidence concerning the existence of the Kingdom in
support of his Motion to Dismiss.
 
Id. at 487, 291 P.3d at 385.
 
In Fergerstrom, this court stated:
 
[T]he State of Hawai' i has lawful jurisdiction over all
persons operating motor vehicles on public roads or highwayswithin the State of Hawai' i. Persons claiming to be
citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai' i and not of the State of 
Hawai'i are not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai' i 
applicable to all persons (citizens and non-citizens)operating motor vehicles on public roads and highways withinthe State of Hawai' i. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i at 55, 101 P.3d at 664. 
Consistent with Kaulia and Fergerstrom, we hold that 
the District Court had jurisdiction over Kanaka 'ole's cases. 
II.
 
We affirm the Judgment entered by the District Court on
 
December 5, 2012, in 3DTA-08-02625, 3DTA-10-01865, 
3DTC-08-023033, 3DTC-08-024235, 3DTC-10-004141, 3DTC-10-005190,
 3DTC-10-005772, and 3DTC-10-025081.
