IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE INTEREST OF H CHILDREN
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 10-00193)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Father-Appellant (Father) appeals from the Family Court
 
of the First Circuit's (Family Court's)1
 Order Terminating
Parental Rights, filed on December 10, 2012, and also challenges
 
the Family Court's November 30, 2012 Decision Regarding Trial on
 Motion to Terminate Parental Rights and the December 10, 2012
 Letters of Permanent Custody. The Family Court terminated
 Father's parental rights to KH and JH (the Children), appointed
 
the Director of the Department of Human Resources (DHS) to be
 
permanent custodian of the Children, and approved DHS's Permanent
 
Plan (6/2/12 Permanent Plan). 
On appeal, Father appears to argue that the Family
 
Court abused its discretion in terminating his parental rights
 where the Findings of Facts (
FOF) in the court's January 25, 2013
 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL) weighed in his
 
favor, he should have been given more time to complete his
 
services, and various of the FOFs are clearly erroneous and
 certain of the the COLS are wrong. Father contests FOFs 64, 93,

94, 97, 98, 101, 132, 133, 134, 137, 143, 144, 148, 149, and 152, 
and COLs 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Father's points of error as follows:
 
Father has failed to include the information required
 
by the Rules Expediting Child Protective Appeals (RECPA) Rule
 
11(a)(3) in his Points of Error Section. See RECPA Rule
 
11(a)(3). Further, although he apparently contests numerous FOFs
 
and COLs, he provides no discernible argument with regard to
 them. See RECPA Rule 11(a)(4). Consequently, his points are
 
2
waived.  See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 
28(b)(4) & (7). Regardless, to the extent Father's points can be discerned, they lack merit. 
The Family Court did not clearly err in concluding that 
Father was not willing and able to provide the Children with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, and it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would become willing and able to do so within a reasonable period of time; and FOFs 64, 132, 133, and 134 are not clearly erroneous and COLs 1 and 2 are not wrong. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 587A-7 (Supp. 
2012); In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001); 
In re Doe, 100 Hawai' i 335, 345, 60 P.3d 285, 295 (2002). 
Based on the record in this case, we conclude that the 
Family Court did not clearly err in concluding that the 6/2/12 Permanent Plan was in the Children's best interests, FOF 137 is not clearly erroneous, and COLs 5 and 6 are not wrong. See HRS 
§ 587A-33(a)(3)(B) (Supp. 2012); In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i at 190, 20 
P.3d at 623. 
The Family Court did not clearly err in concluding that
 
DHS gave Father a reasonable amount of time in which to remedy
 the problems that put the Children at substantial risk of being

the future noncompliance with RECPA Rule 11 and HRAP Rule 28 may result in
sanctions.

harmed in the family home and to reunify with the Children; and
 
FOFs 143, 144, 148, and 149 are not clearly erroneous. See HRS
 
§§ 587A-31(g) (Supp. 2012) & -33(a)(2) (Supp. 2012). 
The remaining contested FOFs and COLs do not express 
the court's ultimate determinations. FOFs 93, 94, 97, 98, 101, and 152 are not clearly erroneous and COLs 8 and 9 are not wrong. See In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623. 
Therefore, the Family Court's December 10, 2012 Order
 
Terminating Parental Rights is affirmed.
