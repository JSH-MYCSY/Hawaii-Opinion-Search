On appeal, the Padrons contend the circuit court erred
 
in granting the Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of
 
Possession in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee, Federal Home Loan
 Mortgage Corporation (Federal Home), because a genuine issue of
 
material fact remained as to whether the subject mortgage loan is
 
void pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) § 454-8 (1993)
 
(repealed effective Jan. 1, 2011).

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude the
 Padrons' appeal is without merit.
 
On appeal, the only point of error the Padrons raise is
 
that the circuit court erred when it granted Federal Home's
 Motion for Summary Judgment because a genuine issue of material
 fact remained as to whether the underlying promissory note (Note)
 
and mortgage (Mortgage), securing the Note, are void pursuant to
 
HRS § 454-8. The Padrons argue that because the Note and
 
Mortgage are void, the "purported foreclosure of that [Mortgage]
 and subsequent quitclaim transfer of title to [Federal Home] are
 similarly void."
 
Under HRS § 454-8, "[a]ny contract entered into by any 
person with any unlicensed mortgage broker or solicitor shall be void and unenforceable." The Padrons contend that "[l]icensing as a mortgage broker was an absolute requirement for any non­exempt entity engaging in the business of mortgage lending in the State of Hawai
'i, as [SecurityNational Mortgage Company dba 
SecurityNational Mortgage Company, Inc. (SecurityNational)] did 
here."3 The Padrons appear to suggest that all non-exempt

 HRS § 454-8 provides in relevant part:
 
§ 454-8 Penalty, contracts void. . . . Any
contract entered into by any person with any
unlicensed mortgage broker or solicitor shall be void
and unenforceable.

 The Padrons obtained the Note from SecurityNational. As security
for the Note, the Padrons also executed a Mortgage on their Property to
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for
SecurityNational. On May 18, 2010, MERS assigned its interest in the Mortgage
(continued...)

mortgage lenders are required to hold a mortgage broker license,
 
even if the lenders do not engage in the practice of mortgage
 brokering.
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court, however, has specifically 
rejected this argument in Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai
'i 289, 30 P.3d 895 (2001). The court in Kida determined 
that "a hyperliteral construction of HRS § 454-8 would yield an absurd result, inasmuch as a contract wholly unrelated to mortgage brokerage activity, notwithstanding that a party to the contract is a unlicensed mortgage broker, is obviously beyond the intended scope of the statute." Id. at 309, 30 P.3d at 915. 
Accordingly, the Kida court held that "HRS § 454-8 must be interpreted to invalidate only those contracts into which unlicensed mortgage brokers enter in their capacity as mortgage brokers within the meaning of HRS § 454-1." Id. 
It is undisputed that SecurityNational was not licensed
 
as a mortgage broker when the Padrons obtained their mortgage
 loan. Thus, the determining issue on appeal is whether the
 Padrons raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether
 SecurityNational brokered the Padrons' 2007 mortgage loan so as
 to require a mortgage broker license.
 
HRS § 454-1 (1993) (repealed effective Jan. 1, 2011)
 
defines "[m]ortgage broker" as "a person not exempt under section
 454-2 who for compensation or gain, or in the expectation of
 compensation or gain, either directly or indirectly makes,
 negotiates, acquires, or offers to make, negotiate, or acquire a
 mortgage loan on behalf of a borrower seeking a mortgage loan." 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The Padrons allege that SecurityNational was a mortgage
 
broker without producing any evidence in support of such a claim. 
It is well settled that "[a] party opposing a motion for summary
 judgment cannot discharge his or her burden by alleging
 conclusions, 'nor is [the party] entitled to a trial on the basis
 
3(...continued)
to BAC Home Loans Serving, LP (
BAC). BAC subsequently foreclosed on the
Property and obtained title to the Property in a public auction. BAC then
 
transferred title to the Property to Federal Home, Plaintiff-Appellee in this
current action.

of a hope that [the party] can produce some evidence at that
 
time.'" Henderson v. Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387, 401,
 
819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991) (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur
 R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil
 2d § 2727 (1983)). 
The Padrons' joint declaration does not offer proof
 
that SecurityNational made, negotiated, or acquired the Padrons'
 mortgage loan on behalf of Padron. The joint declaration only
 states that "[i]n order to purchase the Property, [the Padrons]
 obtained a loan from [SecurityNational]." The record indicates
 that SecurityNational was merely the named lender on the Padrons'
 Note and Mortgage, as put forth by Federal Home. SecurityNational
 was acting on its behalf as a lender, not on behalf of Padron as
 a broker. The Padrons have failed to raise a genuine issue of
 material fact as to whether SecurityNational acted as a mortgage
 broker.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's (1) "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 Summary Judgment Filed November 29, 2011," filed December 18,
 2012; (2) "Writ of Possession," filed December 18, 2012; (3)
 "Final Judgment," filed December 18, 2012; (4) "Order Denying
 Defendants Liza Padron and Letty Padron's Non-Hearing Motion to
 Reconsider This Court's Decision Granting Plaintiff Federal Home
 Loan Mortgage Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed
 August 8, 2012," filed November 27, 2012; and (5) "Amended Final
 Judgment," filed May 29, 2013, are affirmed.
