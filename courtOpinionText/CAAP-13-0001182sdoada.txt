Defendants-Appellants

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 3RC12-01-112K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
This appeal arises out of a debt collection action in
 
the District Court of the Third Circuit ("District Court")2/
 
claiming that $16,199.79 was owing under a $75,000 promissory
 
note entered into between Defendants-Appellants William K.
 Freitas and Cindy K. Freitas ("Defendants") as guarantors and the
 Native Hawaiian Revolving Loan Fund, Office of Hawaiian Affairs. 
OHA claimed that the loan was in default and on August 18, 2011,
 notified Defendants that their account would be assigned to
 former Plaintiff-Appellee Credit Associates of Maui, Inc. ("CAM")
 for collection if there was no asset sale, payment, or loan
 
1/
 On December 9, 2013, the request by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs
("OHA") to be substituted as the plaintiff-appellee in place of Credit
Associates of Maui, Ltd. was approved.

payoff by August 31, 2011. 
Defendants, appearing pro se, and purportedly also on 
behalf of Pa 'a Pohaku Builders, Inc. ("PPBI") appeal from the 
December 17, 2012 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary 
Judgment ("December 17, 2012 Order"), the March 1, 2013 Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Reconsider Plaintiff's Summary Judgment on October 30, 2012 ("March 1, 2013 Order"),
3/ the 
4/
March 1, 2013 Judgment,  and the April 1, 2013 Order Denying
Defendants' [Rule 60(b)] Motion to Dismiss ("April 1, 2013

 
Order"), each order and judgment entered by the District Court in
 favor of CAM. On appeal, Defendants allege that the District
 Court erred in granting CAM's motion for summary judgment, and
 abused its discretion in denying both their motion to reconsider
 the grant of summary judgment and their motion to dismiss.
5/
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the
 Defendants' appeal as follows:
6/
 
We begin by noting that Defendants are not entitled to 
appellate review of the December 17, 2012 Order, the March 1, 2013 Order, or the March 1, 2013 Judgment. The Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 58 separate-judgment-document rule under Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 
3/
 Defendants attached an unfiled copy of the March 1, 2013 Order to
the notice of appeal. This is not fatal to Defendants' appeal because the
notice of appeal gives CAM effective notice of the intent to appeal from the
March 1, 2013 Order, the March 1, 2013 Judgment, and the April 1, 2013 Order,
each of which have been filed and are part of the record on appeal. See State
 
v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai' i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). 
4/
 Defendants' notice of appeal does not designate the December 17,
2012 Order or the March 1, 2013 Judgment, but it appears from the opening
brief that Defendants intend to appeal from that order and judgment. As OHA
 raises no objection, we proceed to address our jurisdiction over the order and
judgment.
 
5/
 Defendants' points of error have been re-written for clarity and
organization. 
6/
 Defendants purport to appeal on behalf of not only themselves, but
also PPBI. Defendants, however, are not attorneys, and are not entitled to
represent a corporation such as PPBI in a trial court or on this appeal.
Therefore, Defendants and PPBI's May 30, 2013 notice of appeal is not
effective as to PPBI, and PPBI is not entitled to any appellate review in this
case.

869 P.2d 1334 (1994) is not applicable to district court cases. 
Accordingly, "an order that fully disposes of an action in the district court may be final and appealable . . . as long as the appealed order ends the litigation . . . and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated." Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 
Hawai
'i 425, 427, 984 P.2d 1251, 1253 (1999). 
The March 1, 2013 Judgment granted judgment against 
Defendants, and awarded $16,213.10 in damages, $78.32 in interest, $3079.71 in attorney's fees, and $556.60 in various costs in favor of CAM. As such, t he March 1, 2013 Judgment finally determined and ended the litigation. See Wiesenberg v. University of Hawai
'i, 138 Hawai 'i 
210, 216-17, 378 P.3d 926, 932-33 (2016) (final amended judgment that included specific amount of fees and costs was the appealable final order). Therefore, the March 1, 2013 Judgment was an appealable final order under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 641-1(a) (Supp. 2011), and triggered the initial thirty-day time period under Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal. Defendants, however, did not timely file their May 30, 2013 notice of appeal within thirty days after the entry of the March 1, 2013 Judgment or any of the preceding orders. 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) (quoting Naki v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., 50
 Haw. 85, 86, 431 P.2d 943, 944 (1967)); Haw. R. App. P. 26(b)
 ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the
 jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these
 rules."); Haw. R. App. P. 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good
 cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any
 failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
 timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to
 review the December 17, 2012 Order, the March 1, 2013 Order, or
 the March 1, 2013 Judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
As to the April 1, 2013 Order, however, the Defendants
 
timely requested a thirty-day extension of time from the District
 
Court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A). On May 6, 2013, the
 District Court granted Defendants' request. Accordingly,
 pursuant to HRS section 641-1(a), this court has jurisdiction
 over Defendants' appeal as it pertains to the April 1, 2013
 Order. Thus, we consider only the third point of error.
 
In Defendants' third point of error, Defendants claim 
that the District Court "erred in denying Defendant[s'] Motion to Dismiss case base[d] on a letter from OHA terminating [CAM] in the alleged assignment on December 31, 2012 and hiring another collection agency Revenue Cycle Management LLC[.]" Defendants further assert that they were "unjustly misinformed . . . which took away the right of Defendant[s] to respon[d] to any of [CAM]'s filing[s]." Defendants based their motion on Hawai
'i 
District Court Rules of Civil Procedure ("DCRCP") Rule 60(b). On appeal, they reference no case or statutory law to support their assertions, and their argument is without merit. 
This court reviews the District Court's grant or denial
 
of DCRCP Rule 60(b) motions for an abuse of discretion. The law
 provides in relevant part, that a district court, 
may relieve a party or the party's legal representative from
a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
 misconduct of an adverse party[.]
 
D. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b).
 
Here, the District Court did not abuse its discretion
 
when it concluded that:
 
Defendants fail to show any good cause to grant their Motion
to Dismiss. First, the contract expired over ten (10) months
after the complaint was filed, two (2) months after the Court
granted Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and fourteen
(14) days after the entry of the Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Summary  Judgment.  Thus, during all of the
proceedings leading up to a judgment in its favor, Plaintiff
was legally entitled to prosecute the complaint against
 Defendants.
 
Further, there is no evidence or case law to support the

Defendants' conclusion that the Plaintiff's failure to
 disclose the fact that the contract between it and the Office
 of Hawaiian Affairs expired on December 31, 2012 constitutes
 
4
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
a fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading representation
prohibited by HRS § 443B-18.7/
 
(Footnote added).
 
Defendants fail to explain why they are entitled to
 
relief under any of the provisions of DCRCP Rule 60(b). 
Defendants appear to assert that CAM's failure to inform them
 that CAM's contract with OHA expired on December 31, 2012
 constituted fraud. However, Defendants do not "establish that
 the conduct complained of prevented [them] from fully and fairly
 presenting [their] case or defense[.]" See Kawamata Farms, Inc.
 
v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai
'i 214, 251-52, 948 P.2d 1055, 
1092-93 (1997); Bank of New York Mellon v. Johnson, No. CAAP-12­0000446, 2013 WL 2650489, *2 (Hawai
'i App. June 12, 2013) 
(Ginoza, J., concurring). Although CAM and OHA ended their contractual relationship on December 31, 2012, there is no evidence in the record that shows that the District Court abused its discretion when it determined that CAM was legally entitled to prosecute the complaint against Defendants because a valid assignment between CAM and OHA existed until after the December 17, 2012 Order was issued. In fact, the District Court's conclusion was supported by the declaration of Jerome Taniyama of OHA who attested that, notwithstanding the expiration of OHA's contract with CAM, OHA had authorized CAM and its attorneys to complete the instant case and to obtain judgment against the Defendants. 
Further, the District Court did not abuse its

 
discretion when it concluded that CAM's failure to disclose the
 
7/
 Hawaii Revised Statutes section 443B-18 states in relevant part:
 
No collection agency shall use any fraudulent,
deceptive, or misleading representation or means to collect,
or attempt to collect, claims or to obtain information
concerning a debtor or alleged debtor, including any conduct
which is described as follows:
 
. . . .
 
(4)	 The failure to disclose clearly the name and full
business address of the person to whom the claim
has been assigned for collection or to whom the
claim is owed at the time of making any demand
for money[.]
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 443B-18(4) (Supp. 2011).
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
fact that its contract with OHA expired on December 31, 2012 does
 
not constitute fraud, since at the time the complaint was
 prosecuted, CAM was properly assigned the right to do so by OHA. 
Defendants fail to demonstrate how the District Court abused its
 discretion in denying Defendants' post-judgment motion. 
Accordingly the District Court did not abuse its discretion in
 denying Defendants' Rule 60(b) motion.
 
Therefore, Defendants' appeal from the December 17,
 
2012 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, the
 March 1, 2013 Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Reconsider
 Plaintiff's Summary Judgment on October 30, 2012, and the
 March 1, 2013 Judgment are dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction; and the April 1, 2013 Order Denying Defendants'
 Motion to Dismiss is affirmed.
