OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
VALERIE STEPHEN, Complainant-Appellant,
v.
 
HAWAII HEALTH SYSTEMS, CORP., Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-3067-12)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On September 10, 2014, Employer-Appellee Hawaii 
Health Systems Corp. (HHSC) filed a Suggestion of Death, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 43(a), 
suggesting the death of Appellant Valerie Stephen (Stephen) during the pendency of this action and that the appeal should be dismissed; 
(2) There having been no response to the Suggestion of
 
Death from Stephen's counsel, the court entered an order on
 October 15, 2014, requiring inter alia that Stephen's counsel,
 within 20 days, advise the court as to whether counsel or any
 other person intended to file a motion requesting that a personal
 representative be substituted as a party, or whether counsel
 agreed that the appeal should be dismissed;

(3) On November 19, 2014, due to the lack of response
 
from Stephen's counsel, the court entered another order directing
 
counsel to respond within 10 days; and
 
(4) On November 28, 2014, Stephen's counsel responded
 
to the second order and notified the court that attempts to
 contact Stephen's children have been unsuccessful, that counsel
 has not been informed as to any other person who may have been
 designated as a representative of the Estate of Valerie Stephen,
 that "it is determined that further pursuit of this appeal will
 be futile," and that counsel would not be filing a motion to
 substitute a representative for Stephen.
 
Therefore, based on the foregoing and the record in
 
this case, 
It IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, December 5, 2014.
