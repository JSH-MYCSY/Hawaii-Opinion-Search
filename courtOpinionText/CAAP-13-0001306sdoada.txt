APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-1150)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from a medical malpractice lawsuit
 
first filed in 2003 involving Plaintiffs/Appellees Alyssa Ray,
 
Michael Ray, and Debbie Ray (collectively, the Rays) and
 
Defendant/Appellee Kapiolani Medical Specialists (KMS). Non-
Party Insurer/Appellant American International Group, Inc. (AIG)
 
has filed three separate notices of appeal in Case Nos. CAAP-13­
0001306, CAAP-13-0003437, and CAAP-13-0003840 (AIG Appeals). The
 
AIG Appeals were consolidated under CAAP-13-0003840 by order of
 
this court filed November 19, 2013.
 
In CAAP-13-0003840, AIG appeals from the October 2,
 
2013 "Supplemental Order Determining Sanctions Amounts, for May
 6, 2013 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Imposing
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Sanctions on Defendant's Insurer, AIG, Inc. Under RCCH Rule 12.1"

entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
 
court).
 
In CAAP-13-0003437, AIG appeals from the circuit
 
court's August 26, 2013 "Order Denying AIG's Motion for
 
Reconsideration of May 6, 2013 Order Imposing Sanctions on
 Defendant's Insurer, AIG, Inc., Under RCCH Rule 12.1 from Order
 to Show Cause Hearing Held February 1, 2013 (filed June 5,
 2013)," filed under seal (Order Denying Reconsideration). 
In CAAP-13-0001306, AIG appeals from the circuit
 
court's May 6, 2013 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 Order Imposing Sanctions on Defendant's Insurer, AIG, Inc., Under
 RCCH Rule 12.1 from Order to Show Cause Hearing Held February 1,
 2013 (Filed nder Seal)" (FOFs/COLs/Order).
 
AIG contends the circuit court erred by:
 (1) entering its May 6, 2013 FOFs/COLs/Order and its
 
August 26, 2013 Order Denying Reconsideration; 
(2) violating the constitutional due process rights of
 
AIG and Sharon V. Sobers (Sobers), a complex claims director in
 
healthcare malpractice for AIG; and
 
(3) abusing its discretion by imposing on AIG: a $1,000
 
sanction paid to the chief clerk of the circuit court, an order
 
to pay the Rays' attorney's fees and expenses related to
 settlement negotiations, and an order to pay the settlement
 mediator's fees and expenses.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude, with
 one exception, that AIG's appeals lacks merit.

AIG first contends the circuit court erred by finding
 
AIG did not "have a person authorized to settle the case" at the

 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.

 To the extent that our decision refers to matters filed under seal
 
or in camera, we conclude that such references do not reveal privileged
information and are necessary to resolve this appeal.

January 11, 2013 settlement conference, pursuant to Rules of the 
Circuit Court of Hawai 'i (RCCH) Rule 12.1(a)(6), because Sobers 
did have "full settlement authority to settle for [AIG's] valuation of the case[.]" 
The circuit court found Sobers did not have full
 
settlement authority at the January 11, 2013 settlement
 conference because, when asked whether AIG would negotiate within
 the range of damages proposed by the circuit court and the
 mediator, Sobers "responded that she would have to check as to
 whether she could negotiate in the proposed range." The circuit
 court found Sobers had failed to respond by January 14, 2013
 regarding the negotiations, as she stated she would; and that it
 had received Sobers' message that AIG declined negotiation within
 the proposed range "[a]t about 12 noon on January 15, 2013." The
 circuit court found that "[t]he contrived distinctions between
 'settlement authority' and 'settlement strategy' lack[ed]
 credibility and good faith." The circuit court did not clearly
 err by finding Sobers' lack of full settlement authority "led to
 an unproductive settlement conference on January 11 
th
,"
th th
unnecessary delays on January 14  and 15 , a full day of court
 
th
time wasted on January 15 , and an unexpected extension of
travel time for the Rays' mainland counsel.
 
The circuit court gave notice to AIG of the meaning of

 
a person with "full settlement authority" through its notice of
 settlement conference, disapproval of the delays caused by
 Sobers' indecision at the January 11, 2013 settlement conference,
 discussions with KMS' attorney regarding the scope of Sobers'
 settlement authority, and expressions of "doubt that sending
 [Sobers] was in compliance with the Court order." The circuit
 court did not clearly err by finding AIG had failed to comply
 with its order that a person with full settlement authority be
 present at its settlement conferences.
 
AIG cites Zambrano v. City of Tustin, 885 F.2d 1473 at
 
1480 (9th Cir. 1989) for the proposition, "[n]on parties should
 not be disciplined by financial reprisal for conduct attributable
 to mistake, inadvertence or error of judgment." AIG contends it
 was a non-party and any miscommunication of its authority to the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court amounted "to mistake, inadverent [sic] or an error
 
of judgment." Contrary to AIG's characterizations, Zambrano did
 not reverse sanctions levied against attorneys on the basis of
 their non-party status or the lack of intention underlying their
 noncompliance with local rules requiring their admittance in the
 local district bar. Rather, Zambrano's holding was based on
 considerations of judicial economy provided for in Federal Rules
 
3
of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 1,  in light of the trial court's
"startling conclusion" that the plaintiffs' attorneys, who were
 admitted in the state bar and another district's bar, but not
 admitted in the bar of that court, "were not any more qualified
 than an auto mechanic to conduct a trial"; and the decision to
 declare a mistrial. Id. 885 F.2d at 1475-76 (internal quotation
 
marks omitted). It was in the context of facilitating judicial
 economy that the Zambrano court concluded that sanctions against
 attorneys for "mere negligent violations of local rules" was "not
 necessary to the orderly functioning of the court system,
 especially in light of the availability of alternative remedies." 
Zambrano, 885 F.2d at 1480 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 401 (the federal
 contempt statute)). In the instant case, the circuit court
 imposed sanctions because it found AIG's actions had "wasted" the
 court's time and AIG cannot claim "inadvertent" noncompliance
 because notices of settlement conference included notice that
 they had failed to provide a person with full settlement
 authority at the settlement conferences.
 
AIG contends the circuit court erred by failing to
 
require both parties be present at the January 29, 2013
 settlement conference. At the January 29, 2013 conference, the
 circuit court explained that it had excused the Rays from
 appearing because "this is in the context of a settlement
 conference negotiations [sic], and also what the [circuit court]
 is now determining looks to the [circuit court] to be an undue
 
3
 The Zambrano court further noted, "'The force of this first and
 
greatest of the Rules should not be blunted by district court's exaggerating
the importance of local rules and enforcing such rules through inappropriate
over-rigorous sanctions.'" (quoting Woodham v. American Cystoscope Co., 335
 
F.2d 551, 557 (5th Cir. 1964) citing Rule 1 FRCP).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interference with the [circuit court's] ability to conduct
 
meaningful settlement negotiations." Contrary to AIG's
 contention, the circuit court's purpose in holding a settlement
 conference without the Rays was not to "coerce" AIG to settle,
 but to give AIG "an opportunity to respond" to the circuit
 court's impression of undue interference.
 
AIG contends the circuit court entered sanctions
 
against them because AIG and KMS resisted the court's attempts to
 "coerce [KMS] and AIG into settlement for a value much higher
 than the valuation by [KMS.]" The record does not substantiate
 AIG's contention that "[t]he [circuit] court was mad about [KMS']
 participation in the settlement negotiations and the fact that
 AIG declined to adopt the [circuit] court's settlement
 negotiation strategy." The circuit court found that "imped[ing]
 the progress of settlement discussions when time was of the
 essence in view of the imminent February 11, 2013 jury trial
 date" constituted sanctionable conduct. 
Contrary to AIG's contention, the instant case is 
distinguished from Kamaunu v. Kaaea, 99 Hawai
'i 432, 56 P.3d 734, 
(App. 2002) aff'd, 99 Hawai 'i 503, 57 P.3d 428 (2002), in which 
"the imposition of sanctions was premised on Defendant's failure to make a monetary settlement offer and on his firm intention to go to trial, [and was not based] on a failure to ensure the presence of a representative with complete settlement authority at the settlement conference." Kamaunu, 99 Hawai
'i at 506, 57 
P.3d at 431 (footnote omitted). At no time did the circuit court indicate that its sanctions were directed at an action other than AIG's failure to present a person with full settlement authority and the ensuing delay in the circuit court's ability to conclude its settlement conferences. 
AIG contends the circuit court abused its discretion by
 
imposing sanctions consisting of payments to: (1) the chief
 clerk, because the circuit court "was doing the job it was paid
 to do[;]" (2) the mediator, because these sanctions were imposed
 "simply because [KMS] did not offer what the [circuit] court
 wished it to offer[;]" and (3) the Rays' attorney, because the
 hourly rate of $450 and hours allowed were both excessive. AIG
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provides no argument and points to no authority to support its
 
contention that these payments constituted abuses of discretion.
 
In regard to AIG's contention that the hourly rate of 
the Rays' attorney's fees were excessive, we note the circuit court was "an expert . . . and knows as well as a legal expert what are reasonable attorney fees, and that the amount of attorney's fees is within the judicial discretion of the court[.]" Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc., 111 
Hawai
'i 286, 306, 141 P.3d 459, 479 (2006) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). The circuit court took into consideration the Rays' attorney's skill, reputation and stature, 39 years of experience, and the "number, novelty and difficulty of the issues raised in this case, within the highly specialized medical malpractice subject area, and the overall length and nature of this litigation" in determining his reasonable hourly rate should be $450 as opposed to the requested $500 per hour. See Sunday's Child, LLC v. Irongate Azrep BW LLC, 2014 WL 2451560 (D. Haw. 2014) (finding the hourly rate of $450 reasonable and
 "in line with the prevailing rates for comparable attorneys in
 the community"). 
Finally, AIG contends the circuit court "failed to 
notify AIG of its proposal to ban the right of a witness to submit a declaration when that witness resides thousands of miles from Hawai
'i" and thus violated AIG's constitutional due process 
rights. AIG's contention concerns the scope of the circuit court's authority to prohibit Sobers from submitting any but live testimony for the circuit court's consideration. The scope of the circuit court's authority is defined by HRS § 603–21.9(1) and (6) (1993), which provides:
 
§603-21.9 Powers. The several circuit courts shall have
 
power: 
(1)	 To make and issue all orders and writs necessary or
appropriate in aid of their original or appellate
jurisdiction;
 
. . . . 
(6)	 To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, and
mandates, issue such executions and other processes,
and do such other acts and take such other steps as
may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which are or shall be given to them by law or for the
promotion of justice in matters pending before them.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has concluded "if the 
[circuit] court has the inherent power to level the ultimate 
sanction of dismissal, it necessarily has the power to take all reasonable steps short of dismissal, depending on the equities of the case." Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 
Hawai
'i 214, 242, 948 P.2d 1055, 1083 (1997), as amended (Jan. 
13, 2004) (quoting Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), 76 Hawai
'i 494, 507, 880 P.2d 169, 182 (1994)). Given 
inconsistencies between Sobers' declarations dated January 31, 2013 and June 5, 2013 and recognition of the discretion afforded to the circuit court in making credibility determinations, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Sobers from filing further written declarations and requiring her live testimony in this case. However, absent a finding of bad faith based upon clear and convincing evidence, the circuit court erred in extending this prohibition to all future declarations by Sobers in "any other case[.]" See Bank of Hawaii v. Kunimoto, 91 
Hawai
'i 372, 389–91, 984 P.2d 1198, 1215–17 (1999). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
 (1) the October 2, 2013 "Supplemental Order Determining
 
Sanctions Amounts, for May 6, 2013 Findings of Fact, Conclusions
