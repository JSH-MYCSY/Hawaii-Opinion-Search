OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant, Avelina
 
Salvacion (Salvacion), appeals from the May 22, 2013 "Judgment on
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed January 15, 2009 and
 Order Granting Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant's Motion for
 Summary Judgment as to All Counts of Defendant/Counterclaimant
 Avelina Salvacion's Counterclaim, Filed January 13, 2012,"
 
1
entered in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit  (circuit
 
court).
 
I.
 
On appeal, Salvacion contends the circuit court erred 
when it granted "Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and 
Decree of Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed January 15, 2009" (2009 MSJ) and "Plaintiff/Counterclaim 
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Counts of 
Defendant/Counterclaimant Avelina Salvacion's Counterclaim, Filed January 13, 2012" (Counterclaim MSJ) in favor of 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee, U.S. Bank National 
Association (USBNA). Although not raised as a point of error on 
appeal, Salvacion also argues in her opening brief that the 
circuit court abused its discretion when it declined to grant Salvacion's request for a continuance pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f).
II.
 
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 
Hawai'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005). 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there

is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Id. at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette v. Plastic Recycling,
 
Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has set forth the following 
burden-shifting paradigm for situations where the non-movant
 bears the burden of proof at trial:
 
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as
to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of
substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a
matter of law. This burden has two components.
 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing support
for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material fact
exists with respect to the essential elements of the claim
or defense which the motion seeks to establish or which the
 motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed facts, it
is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Only
when the moving party satisfies its initial burden of
production does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to
respond to the motion for summary judgment and demonstrate
specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that
present a genuine issue worthy of trial.
 
Second, the moving party bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion. This burden always remains with the moving
party and requires the moving party to convince the court
that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the
moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law.

issue of fact. An abuse of discretion occurs where the
 
trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.

Hawai'i 446, 454, 56 P.3d 748, 756 (App. 2002) (quoting Josue v. 
Isuzu Motors Am., Inc., 87 Hawai 'i 413, 416, 958 P.2d 535, 538 
(1998)). 
III.
 
A. The circuit court did not err in granting USBNA's 2009
MSJ and Counterclaim MSJ.
 
1.	 There is no genuine issue of material fact as to
whether fraud was committed because the actions of
 Salvacion's mortgage broker cannot be imputed onto
USBNA so as to invalidate the Adjustable Rate Note
(Note) and the mortgage on Salvacion's property
that secured the Note (Mortgage).
 
On appeal, Salvacion contends the circuit court erred
 
when it granted USBNA's 2009 MSJ and Counterclaim MSJ because
 
"there exists a genuine issue of material facts as to whether the
 [Note] and [Mortgage] are void because of the gross fraud
 committed against [Salvacion]." Salvacion does not allege that
 USBNA's predecessors, BNC Mortgage, Inc. (BNC Mortgage) and
 
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) (together,
Lenders) committed fraud. Instead, Salvacion argues that her
 
mortgage broker, James Lull (Lull) fraudulently induced her to
 
refinance her property and invest $72,000 of the equity with him
 
in a short term investment agreement. USBNA provided evidence
 that Lenders were not party to the investment agreement between
 Salvacion and Lull. The record indicates the only agreements
 between Lenders and Salvacion relate to the Note and Mortgage.
 
Furthermore, this court has held that a mortgage 
contract is between a lender and borrower, not the borrower's mortgage broker. See City Bank v. Abad, 106 Hawai
'i 406, 105 
P.3d 1212 (App. 2005) (holding that a mortgage broker is not party to a contract between a lender and a borrower); cf. Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai
'i 289, 30 P.3d 895 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2001) (holding that a mortgage broker, who also acts as a
 
lender, is party to a contract with a borrower). Similarly, the
 U.S. District Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[i]n general, a 
lender is not liable for the actions of a mortgage broker unless there [sic] 'there is an agency relationship between the lender and the broker.'" Menashe v. Bank of New York, 850 F. Supp.2d 
1120, 1135 (D. Haw. 2012) (quoting Gonzalez v. First Franklin Loan Servs., 2010 WL 144862, at *13 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 11, 2010). 
In order to hold USBNA liable for Lull's conduct,
 
Salvacion needed to offer evidence showing that Lenders granted
 Lull actual or apparent authority. It is well established that
 "[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment cannot
 discharge his or her burden by alleging conclusions, 'nor is [the
 party] entitled to a trial on the basis of a hope that [the
 party] can produce some evidence at that time.'" Henderson v.
 
Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387, 401, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991)
 (quoting 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay
 Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2727 (1983)). 
In Salvacion's "Memorandum in Opposition to [Counterclaim MSJ],"
 (Memorandum in Opposition) filed June 20, 2012, Salvacion offered
 
only a brief conclusory statement alleging that Lenders were
 
acting "through its agent, Mr. Lull." Salvacion did not provide
 any evidence that would raise a genuine issue as to whether Lull
 was acting as Lender's agent when he entered into the investment
 scheme with Salvacion. 
2.	 There is no genuine issue of material fact as to
whether Lenders engaged in unfair and deceptive
practices in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 480-2 (2008 Repl.) so as to invalidate the
Note and Mortgage.
 
Salvacion also argues that summary judgment was 
improper because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to 
whether Lenders and Lull engaged in unfair or deceptive practices so to violate HRS Chapter 480. As a threshold matter, Hawai
'i 
law indicates that a mortgage loan transaction "falls within the ambit of HRS [Chapter] 480[.]" Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Keka, 94 Hawai 'i 213, 227, 11 P.3d 1, 15 (2000) (citing Cieri v. 
Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Hawai 'i 54, 905 P.2d 29 (1995)). 
HRS § 480-2 states that "[u]nfair methods of competition and 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." Under Hawai
'i law, "[a] deceptive act 
or practice is (1) a representation, omission, or practice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances where (3) the representation, omission, or practice is material." Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 254, 
262, 141 P.3d 427, 435 (2006) (citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Salvacion's first HRS § 480-2 argument is that the loan
 
with Lenders constituted "unfair and deceptive predatory lending"
 because Salvacion's monthly mortgage payments were nearly $1,000
 more than her gross monthly income. USBNA claims that summary
 judgment was appropriate as a matter of law because "lenders
 generally owe no duty to a borrower not to place borrowers in a
 loan where there was a foreseeable risk borrowers would be unable
 to pay." Caniadido v. Countrywide Bank, FSB, 2011 WL 2470640, at
 
*10 (D. Haw. Jun. 20, 2011) (citation and internal quotation
 marks omitted). A Ninth Circuit opinion, however, has called
 into question whether a negligence analysis is the proper
 standard for determining when a lender has engaged in an unfair
 or deceptive practice under HRS § 480-2. See Compton v.
 
Countrywide Fin. Corp., 761 F.3d 1046 (9th Cir. 2014). Under the
 facts of this case, however, this court need not address this
 issue. Instead, the facts presented are sufficient to create a
 prima facie showing that Salvacion was not misled by Lenders'
 practices and, therefore, Lenders did not violate HRS § 480-2. 
Salvacion's Memorandum in Opposition indicates that she
 
relied upon the advice of Lull to reach the conclusion that she
 could afford the higher monthly mortgage payment. Salvacion's
 mistaken belief that she could afford payments that were larger
 than her gross monthly income was not the result of Lenders'
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
actions, but, instead, were the result of her investment
 
agreement with Lull.
 
Salvacion fails to provide specific facts about how
 
Lenders' acts or practices misled her so to raise a genuine issue
 worthy of trial. Notably, Salvacion does not claim that she was
 unaware of the high monthly mortgage payments. Instead,
 Salvacion argues that negotiations with Lull and representations
 that derived from those negotiations "caused [her], 'as a natural
 and probable result,' to believe that she would be able to afford
 the high monthly mortgages with the $72,284, until she refinanced
 to a lower interest rate."
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has defined "deception" under 
HRS § 480-2 as "an act causing, as a natural and probable result, a person to do that which he or she would not otherwise do." Keka, 94 Hawai
'i at 228, 11 P.3d at 16 (brackets omitted) 
(quoting State ex rel. Bronster v. United States Steel Corp., 82 Hawai
'i 32, 51, 919 P.2d 294, 313 (1996)). Here, the actions of 
Lenders did not cause Salvacion to agree to pay a higher monthly mortgage payments than she could afford. Rather, Salvacion knowingly agreed to pay the higher monthly mortgage rate so that she could participate in Lull's potentially lucrative investment scheme. Given the facts presented, the only inference that can reasonably be drawn is that Lenders did not mislead Salvacion into believing she could afford higher mortgage payments nor did Lenders cause her to enter into a loan that she would not have otherwise entered. 
Salvacion's second HRS § 480-2 argument is that USBNA
 
should be liable for Lull's actions. Lull's culpability cannot
 be imputed onto Lenders absent a showing of an agency
 relationship. As noted supra, Salvacion did not offer any
 evidence that would give rise to a genuine issue of whether an
 agency relationship existed and, instead, relied upon unsupported
 allegations that Lull was acting as Lenders' agent because he
 brokered the Mortgage.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3.	 There is no genuine issue of material fact as to
USBNA's standing to foreclose on the Mortgage
because Salvacion does not have standing to
challenge the Mortgage assignment.
 
Salvacion argues that summary judgment was
 
inappropriate because there is a genuine issue of material fact
 
as to whether Lenders properly assigned the Mortgage to USBNA.

USBNA produced documents that showed a direct chain of
 
title from the initial lender, BNC Mortgage, to USBNA so to
 constitute a prima facie showing of its right to foreclose.

Bank Trust Co. v. Beesley, 2012 WL 5383555, at *3 (D. Haw. Oct.
 30, 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Apana v.
 Kapano, 20 Haw. 399, 403 (Haw. Terr. 1911). 
In her Memorandum in Opposition, Salvacion challenged 
the validity of the assignment from MERS to USBNA. Salvacion argues that, under the Trust agreement, USBNA did not have the authority to accept new assets into the Trust and, therefore, lacked standing to foreclose on Salvacion's Mortgage. Recent decisions by State and Federal courts in Hawai
'i have "rejected 
identical arguments that contesting the validity of assignments to securitization trusts." Wells Fargo Bank v. Hensley, No. 
2
 Salvacion also contends that USBNA is not a holder in due course
 
and is, therefore, "liable for any wrongdoing by its assignors pursuant to HRS
§ 490:3-306." Because this court determines there is no genuine issue of
material fact as to whether Lull was acting as Lenders' agent, whether Lenders
committed fraud in the inducement, or whether Lenders violated HRS §§ 480-2
and 480-12 (2008 Repl.), this claim has no bearing on the outcome of this
appeal.
 
3
 The record indicates that on August 3, 2006, Salvacion executed
the Note to lender, BNC Mortgage. On August 3, 2006, Salvacion also executedthe Mortgage on her Property to mortgagee, MERS, acting as nominee for BNCMortgage. The State of Hawai' i Bureau of Conveyances recorded the Mortgage on
August 14, 2006 as Document Number 2006-149125. On April 21, 2008, MERSassigned the Note and Mortgage to USBNA, as Trustee for the "BNC Mortgage LoanTrust 2006-2" (Trust). This assignment was recorded in the Bureau ofConveyances on June 20, 2008, under Document Number 2008-099769. Thus, USBNAmade a prima facie showing that it was the holder of the Note and Mortgage andhad the right to foreclose.

Bank Nat'l Ass'n., 2012 WL 3202180, at *5 (D. Haw. Aug. 3, 2012)
 (holding that borrowers could not set aside assignment of a
 mortgage even when the terms of a pooling service agreement (PSA)
 
were not followed); Bank of New York Mellon v. Sakala, 2012 WL
 
1424665, at *5 (D. Haw. Apr. 24, 2012) (stating that "[C]ourts
 have held that noncompliance with the terms of a PSA is not
 relevant to the validity of an assignment."); White v. IndyMac
 Bank, FSB, 2012 WL 966638, at 6 (D. Haw. Mar. 20, 2012) (stating
 "The argument that parties lose their interest in a loan when it
 is assigned to a securitization trust or REMIC has been rejected
 by numerous courts.").
 
Typically, borrowers do not have standing to challenge 
the validity of an assignment of its loans because they are not parties to the agreement and because noncompliance with a trust's governing document is irrelevant to the assignee's standing to foreclose. See Hensley, SDO at *1 (concluding that 
"[N]oncompliance with a PSA is irrelevant to the assignee's standing to foreclose."); Abubo v. Bank of New York Mellon, 2011 WL 6011787, at *8 (D. Haw. Nov. 30, 2011) (discussing several cases that held the same). Hawai
'i courts may recognize 
exceptions when a challenge would deem the assignment void, not voidable. See Beesley, 2012 WL 5383555, at *4 (stating that 
"[d]ebtors lack standing to challenge voidable assignments"); Paik-Apau v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., 2012 WL 5207495, at *4 (D. Haw. Oct. 19, 2012). 
Salvacion cites two cases from other jurisdictions for
 
the proposition that, non-compliance with the terms of a trust's
 governing document renders the assignment void, and therefore,
 Salvacion has standing to challenge the mortgage assignment. See
 
Glaski v. Bank of America, Nat'l Ass'n, 160 Cal Rptr.3d 449, 462­63 (2013) (interpreting New York trust law); see also In re
 Saldivar, 2013 WL 2452699 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. Jun. 5, 2013), at *4­5 (same). However, these two cases are the clear minority on the
 matter and run counter to the majority of decisions that have
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
expressly rejected such assignment challenges. See Mendoza v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 175 Cal Rptr.3d 880, 890 (2014) 
(holding that "We can find no state or federal cases to support the Glaski analysis and will follow the federal lead in rejecting this minority holding."); Subramani v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A., 2013 WL 5913789, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 31, 2013) (declining to follow Glaski's minority rule and following the majority rule that "[A]n unrelated third party to an alleged securitization lacked standing to enforce any agreements (like a PSA) relating to such transactions[.]"); In re Sandri, 501 B.R. 369, 374 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2013) (stating that "Glaski is inconsistent with the majority line of cases and is based on a questionable analysis of New York trust law."). In addition, the Glaski and Saldivar approach is inapposite to Hawaii's approach because Hawai
'i courts have determined that non-compliance with the terms 
of a governing document does not render the assignment void, but merely voidable. See Beesley, 2012 WL 5383555, at *5 (holding 
that non-compliance with the terms of PSA agreement when the loan was transferred into trust after the cut-off date renders the agreement voidable); Paik-Apau, 2012 WL 5207495, at *4 (D. Haw. Oct. 19, 2012) (same).
B.	 The circuit court did not err when it denied
 
Salvacion's request for a HRCP Rule 56(f) continuance
because further discovery would not have rebutted
USBNA's showing of absence of genuine issue of material
fact.
 
Salvacion contends the circuit court erroneously denied 
her request for a continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f). 
Salvacion made her request for a continuance on December 16, 2011 in her Memorandum in Opposition to USBNA's 2009 MSJ. Salvacion argued that a continuance would give an "opportunity for [her] to obtain additional documents to support her position, such as verification of [USBNA] Trust's actual ownership of her Note and Mortgage as required under its own Trust Agreement and the relevant Uniform Commercial Code laws, as adopted in Hawaii [Hawai
'i]." 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has noted that "HRCP Rule 
56(f) is the appropriate means by which parties can ensure that 
they have adequate time to respond to a motion for summary judgment." Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i at 63, 292 P.3d at 1293. A 
4
request for a continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f)  "must
demonstrate how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable the moving party, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of absence of a genuine issue of fact." Kaleikini, 128 Hawai
'i at 87, 283 P.3d at 94 (brackets omitted), 
(quoting Josue, 87 Hawai 'i at 416, 958 P.2d at 538). In Ralston, 
the supreme court clarified that "summary judgment should not be granted when there is still time for the non-movant to develop evidence for use at trial, unless there is a basis for concluding . . . that such an effort would be futile." Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i 
at 63, 292 P.3d at 1293. 
In Salvacion's request for a HRCP Rule 56(f)
 
continuance, she argued that a continuance would allow her to
 conduct discovery relevant to whether USBNA's assignment of the
 Mortgage was proper and whether USBNA has standing to bring the
 foreclosure action. Any further discovery into Salvacion's
 assignment claims would have been futile because, as a matter of
 law, Salvacion does not have standing to challenge the assignment
 of her Mortgage. Further discovery would not have "rebut[ted]
 [USBNA's] showing of absence of genuine issue of fact." The
