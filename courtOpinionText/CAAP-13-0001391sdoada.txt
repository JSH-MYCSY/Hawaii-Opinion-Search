IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MICHAEL COPELAND, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 11-1-0046)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth, Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Michael Copeland (Copeland) appeals
 
from the "Judgment of Conviction of Probation Sentence"
 
(Judgment) entered on March 5, 2013, and the "Order of
 Resentencing Revocation of Probation" (Resentencing Order)
 entered on May 15, 2013, in the Family Court of the First Circuit
 (family court).

In the Resentencing Order, the family court found that
 
Copeland inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial
 requirement of the Judgment setting forth the terms and
 conditions of probation. Copeland had been on probation stemming
 from his guilty plea to three counts: Count I, Abuse of Family or
 Household Members, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 709-906(1) & (8) (Supp. 2011); Count II, Terroristic
 Threatening in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-717
 (2014); and Count III, Refusal to Comply with a Lawful Order of a

Police Officer, in violation of HRS § 709-906(1), (4) & (5)(a)
 
(Supp. 2011). As a result of Copeland's failure to comply with
 the terms of his probation, the family court inter alia
 resentenced Copeland as to Count I, a class C felony, from five
 years of probation (which included a special condition of one
 year imprisonment), to five years of imprisonment.

On appeal, Copeland does not challenge the revocation
 
of probation, but contends that the family court committed plain
 error and violated his equal protection rights when it
 resentenced him for a felony rather than a misdemeanor, relying
 on State v. Modica, 58 Haw. 249, 567 P.2d 420 (1977). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 Copeland's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 52(b) provides 
that "[p]lain error or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court." Therefore, an appellate court "may recognize plain error when the error committed affects substantial rights of the defendant." State v. Staley, 91 Hawai
'i 275, 282, 982 P.2d 904, 
911 (1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The appellate court "will apply the plain error 
standard of review to correct errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights." State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai
'i 
327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006) (citation and block quote format omitted). An appellate court's "power to deal with plain

 The family court declined to impose a new sentence for Counts II and
III, for which Copeland had been sentenced to one year probation (including a
special condition of six months imprisonment), because Copeland had already
served one year in jail with credit for time served and had therefore served
his sentence on these two counts.

error is one to be exercised sparingly and with caution because
 
the plain error rule represents a departure from a presupposition
 of the adversary system--that a party must look to his or her
 counsel for protection and bear the cost of counsel's mistakes." 
Id. at 335, 141 P.3d at 982 (citation and block quote format
 omitted).
 
Copeland pled guilty to the felony subsection of HRS
 
§ 709-906, expressly acknowledging that he "committ[ed] the
 offense of Abuse of Family or Household Members, a Class C
 Felony, in violation of Section 709-906(1) and (8) of the Hawaii
 Revised Statutes." As part of the plea deal, Copeland was
 sentenced on Count I to five years of probation, including a
 special condition of one year imprisonment. The Terms and
 Conditions of Probation cautioned Copeland that "UPON ANY FAILURE
 TO COMPLY WITH EACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR
 PROBATION, INCLUDING SPECIAL CONDITIONS, THE COURT MAY REVOKE
 YOUR PROBATION AND SENTENCE YOU TO PRISON OR CHANGE OR ADD TO THE
 CONDITIONS OF YOUR PROBATION." The Judgment was entered on
 March 5, 2013. Subsequently, Copeland violated the terms of his
 probation.
 
Copeland's notice of appeal, filed on June 11, 2013, 
purports to appeal from both the Judgment and the Resentencing Order. However, he did not timely appeal from the March 5, 2013 Judgment.
3 We thus do not have appellate jurisdiction to review 
the Judgment and Copeland cannot now challenge his guilty plea or his original sentence for committing a felony. Grattafiori v. 
State, 79 Hawai
'i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) ("As a general 
rule, compliance with the requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). 
3
 Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b),
Copeland had thirty days to file an appeal from the Judgment. The thirtieth-
day after entry of the Judgment was April 4, 2013. Therefore, Copeland'snotice of appeal was sixty-eight days late with regard to the Judgment.

Further, although Copeland did timely appeal from the
 
Resentencing Order, he presents no argument on appeal challenging
 
the revocation of his probation or explaining how the Judgment
 convicting him of a felony can be amended or changed at this
 point when he failed to timely appeal from the Judgment. We thus
 conclude that the family court did not plainly err in revoking
 Copeland's probation, or in resentencing Copeland for the felony
 to which he had pled guilty and upon which Judgment had entered,
 from which Copeland did not timely appeal.
 
Even if we consider Copeland's arguments related to his
 
resentencing, he fails to demonstrate plain error. His reliance
 on Modica is misplaced. Modica provides that 
where the same act committed under the same circumstances is
 
punishable either as a felony or as a misdemeanor, under
either of two statutory provisions, and the elements of
proof essential to either conviction are exactly the same, a
conviction under the felony statute would constitute a
violation of the defendant's rights to due process and the
equal protection of the laws.
 
58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422.
 
HRS § 709-906 provides in pertinent part:

 
§709-906 Abuse of family or household members;
penalty. (1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or
in concert, to physically abuse a family or household member
or to refuse compliance with the lawful order of a police
officer under subsection (4). . . .
 
. . . .
 
(5) Abuse of a family or household member and refusal
to comply with the lawful order of a police officer under
subsection (4) are misdemeanors . . . [.]
 
. . . .
 
(8) Where the physical abuse consists of intentionally
or knowingly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of
the blood of the family or household member by applying
pressure on the throat or the neck, abuse of a family or
household member is a class C felony.
 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 709-906(8) requires an additional
 
element, "intentionally or knowingly impeding the normal
 breathing or circulation of the blood of the family or household
 member by applying pressure on the throat or the neck," that is
 not a necessary element for a misdemeanor conviction under HRS
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
§ 709-906.4 Thus, an action could be violative of the
 
misdemeanor subsection but not subsection (8). Copeland's equal
 
protection rights have not been violated pursuant to Modica. See
 
58 Haw. at 250-51, 567 P.2d at 421-22 ("A denial of [the
 defendant's constitutional] rights would be the result, only if a
 violation of the misdemeanor statute . . . would invariably and
 necessarily constitute a violation of the felony
 provision . . . .").
 
Copeland's equal protection challenge is also based on
 
his claim that HRS § 709-906 does not satisfy rational basis
 review in that the legislative classification of some forms of
 domestic violence as a felony and others as a misdemeanor is
 unreasonable and arbitrary and lacks a rational relation to
 legitimate government objectives.
5 In addressing an equal
 
protection challenge to the family abuse statute, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court stated:
 
We apply a two-step test to determine whether a statute
passes constitutional scrutiny under the rational basis
test. First, we must ascertain whether the statute was
passed for a legitimate governmental purpose. Second, if
the purpose is legitimate, the court must determine whether
the statute rationally furthers that legitimate government
interest. In making that inquiry, a court will not look for
empirical data in support of the statute. It will only seek
to determine whether any reasonable justification can be
conceived to uphold the legislative enactment. In other
 words, could the Legislature have rationally believed that
the statute would promote its objective.

(2000) (citations, quotation marks, brackets, emphasis, and

4 A misdemeanor offense under HRS § 709-906 requires the offender in
part to "physically abuse" a family or household member. HRS § 709-906(1).
"To 'physically abuse' someone is to 'maltreat in such a manner as to causeinjury, hurt or damage to that person's body.'" State v. Fields, 115 Hawai' i 
503, 530, 168 P.3d 955, 982 (2007) (citation, block quote format and bracketsomitted).

 Copeland contends that varying the classification of crimes based on
the method of abuse and not the harm caused by the abuse is unconstitutional.
Assuming this consideration is valid, this contention is without merit because
the classification of strangulation is partly based on harm inflicted, i.e.,
the impediment of normal breathing or circulation of blood.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has expressly recognized the 
State's interest in curbing domestic violence, see id. at 73-74, 
996 P.2d at 278-79, and classifying strangulation as a class C felony furthers this interest. The legislature added subsection (8) to HRS § 709-906 in 2006. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 46 at 1022. The legislature enacted subsection (8) to add "strangulation to domestic violence, making it a Class C felony[,]" an action supported by many groups. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 665-06, in 2006 House Journal, at 1360. Subsection (8) is one of three subsections to HRS § 709-906 that elevates physical abuse of a family or household member from a misdemeanor to a class C felony. The other two are subsection (7), when an abuser commits a third or subsequent offense within two years of a second or subsequent conviction, and subsection (9), when the physical abuse occurs in the presence of a family or household member under fourteen years of age. Like subsections (7) and (9), subsection (8) of HRS § 709-906 appears to assign greater punishment for acts that have a greater likelihood of causing trauma or suffering to the victim, family and/or household. Because the State has a legitimate interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and given the legislature's emphasis on deterring domestic violence, see Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i at 74, 996 P.2d at 279, it is reasonable 
that the legislature sought to protect Hawai 'i citizens by 
requiring greater criminal punishment to the intentional or knowing strangulation of a family or household member that impedes normal breathing or circulation of blood. 
We thus conclude that, in adopting HRS § 709-906(8),
 
the legislature had a legitimate governmental purpose of curbing
 domestic violence, and that subsection (8) rationally furthers
 that legitimate governmental interest. Copeland's equal
 protection rights have not been violated.
