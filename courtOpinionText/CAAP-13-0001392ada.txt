AOAO Alii Cove (Alii Cove) and Insurance Carrier-Appellant Hawaii
 
Employers' Mutual Insurance Company (together, Appellants) appeal
 
from the (1) March 19, 2013 "Decision and Order" (D&O), (2) May
 
13, 2013 "Order Denying Employer's Motion," which denied

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Attorney's Fee Approval and Order," all issued by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (Board). 
On appeal, Appellants contend the Board erred when it 
(1) concluded a missing signature on Appellants' notice of
 administrative appeal deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction
 and dismissed the administrative appeal, and (2) approved
 Claimant-Appellee Donald W. Cole's (Cole) request for attorney's
 
fees.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 18, 2008, Cole sustained a work injury to
 
his right ankle. On December 10, 2009, the Director of the
 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations Disability
 Compensation Division (Director) determined Cole was entitled to
 
temporary total disability benefits (TTD) from November 1, 2008
 
through December 21, 2008. The Director also determined Cole did
 
not sustain any temporary partial disability from the work injury
 and left the "matters of permanent disability and/or
 disfigurement," if any, to be determined at a later date.
 
On February 26, 2010 the Director issued a Supplemental
 
Decision ordering Alii Cove, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§§ 386-21 (Supp. 2008) and 386-26 (Supp. 2005), "to pay for
 
Michael Dickens, N.D.'s [(Dr. Dickens)] treatment plan dated
 
[December 18, 2009] for an orthopedic surgery evaluation referral
 
to Charles A. Soma, M.D. [(Dr. Soma)]" (February Decision).
 
Appellants appealed the February Decision to the Board on March
 
18, 2010. At Cole's request, the Board temporarily remanded the
 case to the Director to determine additional issues.
 
On October 7, 2011, the Director issued another
 
Supplemental Decision determining: (1) Cole suffered a
 compensable injury to his low back in addition to his right
 ankle; (2) Alii Cove was liable for four treatment plans by Dr.
 Dickens (dated December 18, 2009, March 1, 2010, March 31, 2010,
 and November 22, 2010); (3) Alii Cove was liable for two
 treatment plans by Nathan Ehrlich, N.D. (Dr. Ehrlich) (dated
 
January 14, 2011 and March 14, 2011); (4) Alii Cove was not
 
liable for three other treatment plans (dated November 5, 2010,
 
2
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
February 7, 2011, and May 6, 2011); (5) Cole's change in his
 
attending physicians was approved; and (6) Alii Cove was liable
 for TTD for various time periods from November 2009 through March
 2011, totaling just over 71 weeks and $49,614.85 (October
 
Decision). On October 26, 2011, Appellants filed a notice of
 
appeal with the Board from the October Decision. This notice is
 
the root of the present controversy. 
When filed, the four-page notice of appeal document was
 
comprised of (1) a letter from and signed by Appellants' counsel,
 stating that Appellants' Appeal and Notice of Appeal was
 enclosed; (2) the Appeal and Notice of Appeal which notified the
 Board that Appellants were appealing the Director's October
 Decision but which was not signed; and (3) a Certificate of
 Service that was signed by Appellants' counsel. The omission
 appears to have gone unnoticed for over a year.
 
On November 4, 2011, Appellants filed a Motion For Stay
 
of Payments ordered by the October Decision.
1 On November 9,
 
2011, the Board issued a Notice of Initial Conference for
 December 5, 2011, providing the "conference will be held to
 simplify the issues, establish deadlines, and discuss disposition
 of the administrative file, possible settlement, and any other
 matters which may aid in the orderly resolution of the appeal." 
Cole filed his Initial Conference Statement on November 21, 2011
 and under the section titled Statement of the Issues, provided:
 "Deferred, as this is [Appellants'] appeal." On December 1,
 2011, Appellants filed their Initial Conference Statement
 providing: 
The nine issues that we will raise on our two appeals
are:
 
From the Director's February 26, 2010 supplemental decision:
 1) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liable
for the December 18, 2009 treatment plan by [Dr.

Dickens], for an orthopedic evaluation referral to
[Dr. Soma].
 
From the Director's October 7, 2011 supplemental decision:
 
1
 Cole filed his opposition to Appellants' Motion for Stay on
December 8, 2011 and the Board denied the motion on December 22, 2011.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liable
for the December 18, 2009 treatment plan by [Dr.Dickens]. 
3) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liablefor the March 1, 2010 treatment plan by [Dr. Dickens]. 
4) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liablefor the March 31, 2010 treatment plan by [Dr.Dickens]. 
5) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liablefor the November 22, 2010 treatment plan by [Dr.Dickens]. 
6) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liablefor the January 14, 2011 treatment plan by [Dr.Ehrlich]. 
7) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liablefor the March 14, 2011 treatment plan by [Dr.Ehrlich]. 
8) Whether [Cole] is entitled to, and [Alii Cove] liablefor temporary total disability for the time periodsbeginning 10/15/2009 through 11/30/2009; 12/2/2009through 1/31/2010; 2/2/2010 through 5/31/2010;6/2/2010 through 7/31/2010; 8/2/2010 through12/31/2010; and 3/2/2011 through 4/30/2011 for 71 and2/7 weeks for a total of $49,614.85. 
9) Whether the Director erred in finding [Cole's] lowback condition compensable as a result of theSeptember 18, 2008 work injury. 
On December 12, 2011 the Board issued its First Amended Pretrial
 
Order, providing the nine issues raised by Appellants' Initial
 Conference Statement were to be determined by the Board. Trial
 was set for September 24, 2012.
 
On June 8, 2012, Cole filed a Motion for Temporary
 
Remand so the Director could determine Cole's entitlement to
 reimbursement for additional treatment plans denied by Appellants
 following the October Decision. The Board denied this motion on
 August 6, 2012. The parties agreed by stipulation, approved by
 the Board, to waive their rights to appear in person at trial
 scheduled for September 24, 2012, electing to submit memoranda
 instead.
 
On November 9, 2012, the Board issued an Order to Show
 
Cause "as to why this case should not be dismissed for lack of a
 proper appeal, where the October 26, 2011 document was not
 signed[,]" providing:
 
Whereas, [] on October 26, 2011, a document entitled
"APPEAL AND NOTICE OF APPEAL" was filed with the Department
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability Compensation
Division; and
 
Whereas, said document was not signed; and
 
Whereas, [HRS § 371-4 (Supp. 2012)], provides that
"[t]he [Board] may adopt rules and regulations within its
area of responsibility in accordance with chapter 91"; and
 
Whereas, Section 12-47-13(c) of the Rules of Practice
and Procedure . . . of the [Board] provides, in pertinent
part, as follows: "The original of each document, including
appeals, complaints, answers, motions, notices, briefs, and
amendments shall be signed and dated in black ink by each
party or its authorized representative."
 
Cole contended Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-47-13(c)
 
requires a notice of appeal to be signed, the lack of a signature
 
invalidated Appellants' notice of appeal, and dismissal was
 warranted because the 20-day time period to appeal from the
 October Decision had passed. Appellants responded that their
 signed letter constituted a "written notice of appeal" per HRS
 § 386-87(a) (1993), that they were willing to sign the unsigned
 Appeal and Notice of Appeal, and that no prejudice occurred
 consequent to the missing signature. Appellants also contended
 in the alternative that neither HAR § 12-47-13(c) nor HAR § 12­10-61(c) requires appeals to be signed.
 
On December 6, 2012, the Board held a hearing on the
 
matter and asked for supplemental briefing. In their second
 Memorandum in Support of Objections to Order to Show Cause, filed
 January 14, 2013, Appellants attached a signed copy of the Appeal
 and Notice of Appeal. Appellants cited Becker v. Montgomery, 532
 U.S. 757 (2001) for the proposition that "a person's failure to
 sign the notice of appeal does not deprive the court of appellate
 jurisdiction if the omission is corrected once it is called to
 the appellant's attention . . . ." Cole contended Becker was
 distinguishable because Becker interpreted Federal Rules of
 Appellate Procedure Rules 3 and 11(a), the latter of which
 provides a signature omission procedure, while HAR §§ 12-10 and
 12-47 do not.
 
On March 19, 2013, the Board issued its D&O, finding:
 
6.	 Although [Alii Cove] offered to correct its omission
20 days after the Order to Show Cause was issued,
[Alii Cove] had not corrected its omission and has not
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sought leave to correct the omission by way of a
motion pursuant to the [Board] Rules.
 
7.	 The Board finds, therefore, that the omission was not
corrected or cured promptly.
 
8.	 The Board finds that neither the signed Certificate of
Service nor the letter or memo transmitting the
document to the Disability Compensation Division were
appeals of the Director's October 7, 2011 decision.
 
9.	 The Board further finds that the October 26, 2011
unsigned document was null and void and not a valid
Appeal and Notice of Appeal and was fatal to [Alii
Cove's] appeal of the Director's October 7, 2011
decision.
 
The Board cited Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 11(b), "as guidance" regarding the representations made by a 
signature and the consequent lack of such representations in an unsigned document. The Board distinguished signed cover letters, characterizing Appellants' letter as such, from the signed letters of appeal in the cases cited by Alii Cove. The Board concluded it lacked jurisdiction over Appellants' appeal of the Director's October Decision because the "Appeal and Notice of Appeal filed was not signed by [Alii Cove] and therefore did not vest the Board with subject matter jurisdiction over such an appeal." Consequently, the Board dismissed all issues on appeal except for the sole issue appealed from the February Decision: whether Appellants were liable for the December 18, 2009 treatment plan by Dr. Dickens, for an orthopedic surgery evaluation referral to Dr. Soma.
2 On March 25, 2013, Cole filed 
a Request for Approval of Attorney's Fee. 
On March 28, 2013, Appellants filed the Motion for
 
Reconsideration. Regarding the reconsideration portion of the
 motion, Appellants contended (1) the signed Certificate of
 Service was not separate from the Appeal and Notice of Appeal and
 
3
thus the Notice of Appeal was signed,  (2) HRS § 386-87 does not
require a specific form for the notice of appeal and the signed
 
2
 The February Decision and October Decision were appealed
separately to the Board and the Appeal and Notice of Appeal from the February
Decision was signed.
 
3
 Appellants' contention is based on the fact that the certificate
is numbered 3 of 3 with the first two pages being the unsigned Appeal and
Notice of Appeal.
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cover letter was sufficient, and (3) Appellants' "later
 
advocating" of their appeal to the Board provided the
 certifications contemplated by HRCP Rule 11(b).
4 Regarding the
 
motion for leave to sign the appeal and notice of appeal portion
 of the Motion for Reconsideration, Appellants contended 
Now that the Board has made a determination as of
 
March 19, 2013 in its [D&O] that the Appeal and Notice of
Appeal is invalid without a signature on page 2 of the
Appeal and Notice of Appeal document, the [Appellants' seek]
leave from the Board to correct the omission and sign the
Appeal and Notice of Appeal . . . in the place provided on
page 2 of the Appeal and Notice of Appeal.
 
Appellants reiterated their position that there is no specific
 
procedure for correcting such an omission and that the Board's
 practice for missing signatures on other documents is simply to
 notify the attorney and allow the attorney to sign the document
 without requiring separate motions. Appellants contended
 manifest injustice would occur if the motion for leave was not
 granted as that motion was filed just eight days after the Board
 dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
Cole responded that reconsideration was not appropriate
 
because Appellants presented no new evidence. Cole contended
 that per HRCP Rule 11(b), Appellants were obligated to correct
 
4
 HRCP Rule 11(b) provides:
 
(b) Representations to Court. By presenting to the
court (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later
advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an
attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the
best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief,
formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:
 
(1) it is not being presented for any improper
purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or
needless increase in the cost of litigation;
 
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions
therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
existing law or the establishment of new law;
 
(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have
evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are
likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable
opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and
 
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted
on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are
reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
 
7
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the omission promptly after it was brought to their attention,
 
and at the earliest, Appellants offered to correct the omission
 over 4 months after it was called to their attention by the
 Board's Order to Show Cause and that such delay "isn't acting
 promptly." 
On April 22, 2013, the parties submitted post trial
 
memoranda regarding the non-dismissed issue.
 
The Board denied Appellants' Motion for Reconsideration
 
on May 13, 2012 (May Reconsideration Decision), and issued a
 
Supplemental Decision and Order on May 28, 2013 (Supplemental
Order), resolving the outstanding issue on appeal by concluding
 
Appellants were not liable for the December 18, 2009 treatment
 
plan by Dr. Dickens because the referral was deficient under HAR
 § 12-15-42(b). On June 12, 2013, the Board approved Cole's
 
request for attorney's fees under HRS § 386-93(b) (Supp. 2013). 
Also on June 12, 2013, Appellants appealed the D&O and May
 Reconsideration Decision to this court. On June 21, 2013,
 Appellants filed an amended notice of appeal, adding the Board's
 grant of attorney's fees to the appeal.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of the Board's decision is governed by
HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 Repl.), which provides:
 

 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the decision of
the agency or remand the case with instructions for further
proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision and order if
the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced
because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or
orders are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or
 (2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the
agency; or
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 (4) Affected by other error of law; or
 (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence on the whole record; or
 
(6) Arbitrary or capricious, or characterized by abuse of
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law (COLs) are reviewable
under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding
procedural defects are reviewable under subsection (3).
 
8
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A COL is not binding on an appellate court and is freely
reviewable for its correctness. Thus, the court reviews COLs de
novo, under the right/wrong standard.
 
Capua v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 117 Hawai 'i 439, 444, 184 P.3d 191, 
196 (2008) (quoting Tam v. Kaiser Permanente, 94 Hawai 'i 487, 
494, 17 P.3d 219, 226 (2001) (brackets omitted).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. This court has jurisdiction.
 
Cole contends the "agency decision was not a final 
decision, and did not resolve all claims arising from this 
workers compensation matter." Citing Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women and Children, 89 Hawai
'i 436, 974 P.2d 1026 
(1999), Cole contends this court lacks jurisdiction because "[t]o date, there has been no determination at any level at the Department of Labor regarding permanent disability, further temporary disability or further medical care." (Emphasis in original.) Cole misapprehends Bocalbos. 
HRS § 91–14(a) authorizes judicial review of "a final 
decision and order in a contested case . . . ." While a final order is generally one that ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished, "a final order is not necessarily the last decision in a case." Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 
104 Hawai
'i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 (2004). Workers' 
compensation proceedings create "independent rights' to awards for medical service, temporary compensation, and permanent disability[.]" Id. (citing Bocalbos, 89 Hawai
'i at 439, 974 P.2d 
at 1029) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Given that the matter of permanent disability benefits may be left undetermined for a considerable length of time, an injured worker or an employer must be allowed to seek appellate review of a medical benefits or temporary disability issue, even if the matter of permanent disability has been left for later determination." Bocalbos, 89 Hawai
'i at 442, 974 P.2d at 1032. Consequently, 
regarding workers' compensation cases, this jurisdiction follows the "benefit rule," which "authorizes judicial review of any order which requires any party to pay a penalty or benefits [sic] or denies a claimant any benefit or penalty." Lindinha, 104 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i at 168, 86 P.3d at 977 (citation and internal quotations 
marks omitted). 
The D&O resolved all but one issue through dismissal,
 
which, in effect, required Alii Cove to pay the challenged
 
medical benefits. The Supplemental Order, while not appealed to
 this court, resolved the remaining issue before the Board. As
 such, we have jurisdiction over the D&O, the May Reconsideration
 Decision, and the Board's grant of attorney's fees.
5
 
B. The missing signature did not warrant dismissal.
 
Cole contends the Board did not err by dismissing
 
Appellants' appeal of the October Decision because Appellants
 failed to correct the omitted signature promptly: "Up until its
 belated Motion for Reconsideration [on] March 28, 2013,
 Appellants did nothing to correct the deficiency. This was 139
 days after being apprised of the defect by the [Board] and more
 than 538 days after the filing of the defective appeal[.]" 
However, the Board found Appellants offered to correct the 
omission 20 days after the omission was brought to their
 attention in the Order to Show Cause. And, just over two months
 after the Order to Show Cause was issued, Appellants submitted a
 signed copy of the unsigned appeal document. Notwithstanding
 this offer and attempt to cure, the Board concluded the omission
 was not cured promptly because Appellants had neither corrected
 the omission nor "sought leave to correct the omission by way of
 a motion pursuant to the [Board] Rules."
 
HAR § 12-47-13(c) ("Format for pleadings and other
 
documents.") requires appeals and notices to be signed: "The
 original of each document, including appeals, complaints,
 answers, motions, notices, briefs, and amendments shall be signed
 and dated in black ink by each party or its authorized
 representative." 
HAR § 12-47-17 ("Defective documents.") appears to
 
address the effect of a filed, unsigned document, but does not
 
5
 Applying the benefit rule, Lindinha concluded "the award of 
attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 386–93(b) has no bearing on any other
matters . . . [and] is final under the Bocalbos rationale for purposes of anappeal." Lindinha, 104 Hawai' i at 169, 86 P.3d at 978. 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
11provide a procedure for curing the omission: "Any document filed
with the [Board], which is not in compliance with applicable
rules, orders, or statutes may be accepted by the chief clerk or
designee and filed.  The mere fact of filing, however, shall not
waive any failure to comply with this chapter or any other legal
requirement."
HAR § 12-47-15 ("Retention of documents by the
[Board].") appears to be the Board rule that most resembles a
procedure for curing a unsigned document, providing: "During the
pendency of the appeal, all documents filed with or presented to
the [Board] shall be retained in the files of the [Board].  The
[Board] may, however, permit the withdrawal of original documents
upon submission of properly authenticated copies to replace the
documents."  (Emphasis added.)  This rule, however, does not
provide a specific motion or process for a party to initiate the
correction.  Presumably, a motion that sought relief in the form
of correcting the deficiency could be filed under HAR § 12-47-32. 
However, there does not appear to be a Board rule requiring a
motion to be filed to correct the deficiency as indicated by the
D&O.  Further, Board rules must be "construed to secure the just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of every proceeding."  HAR
§ 12-47-1.
Under the circumstances of this case, the omitted
signature is similar to an insufficiency in the form of a notice
of appeal, which does not raise jurisdictional questions:
A notice of appeal must be both sufficient in
form and timely.  See City and County of Honolulu v.
Midkiff, 57 Haw. 273, 275–76, 554 P.2d 233, 235
(1976).  With respect to the first mandate, this court
has consistently recognized that "the requirement that
the notice of appeal designate the judgment or part
thereof appealed from is not jurisdictional."  Id.  at
275, 554 P.2d at 235 (citations omitted).  Further to
the foregoing,
a mistake in designating the judgment, or in
designating the part appealed from if only a
part is designated, should not result in loss of
the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from
a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from
the notice and the appellee is not misled by the
mistake.
Id. at 275–76, 554 P.2d at 235 (quoting 9 Moore's Federal
Practice 203.18 (1975)) (emphases added).FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai 'i 228, 235, 74 P.3d 980, 987 (2003). 
The parties proceeded for over a year before the
 
omitted signature was noticed. A pre-trial statement was issued
 
by the Board which unequivocally provided the parties involved
 and the issues to be determined, including eight issues from the
 October Decision. The parties stipulated to forgo a trial and
 submit memoranda to resolve the issues. Appellants submitted a
 signed copy of the unsigned appeal document just over two months
 after the omission was brought to their attention. Cole has not
 alleged he was misled or that any prejudice resulted from the
 omitted signature. The record thus shows (1) Appellants' intent
 to appeal from the October Decision could be fairly inferred and
 
6
was in fact acted upon by all parties and the Board,  and (2)
Cole was not misled by the deficiency in the form of Appellants'
 notice of appeal. Consequently, the missing signature should not
 have resulted in loss of the appeal.
 
Further, while this matter does not involve discovery
 
violations, our decision is guided by precedent regarding
 dismissal of claims as discovery sanctions:
 
In reviewing whether a trial court's dismissal of a claim as
a discovery sanction constitutes an abuse of discretion,
appellate courts consider the following five factors: "(1)
the public's interest in the expeditious resolution of
litigation; (2) the court's need to manage its docket; (3)
the risk of prejudice to the [party moving for sanctions];
(4) the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their
merits; and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions."
W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., 8
Haw. App. 354, 362, 802 P.2d 1203, 1207 (1990) (quoting
United States ex rel. Wiltec Guam, Inc. v. Kahaluu Constr.
Co., 857 F.2d 600, 603 (9th Cir.1988) (other citations and
internal quotation marks omitted)).
 
Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawai 'i 68, 71, 229 P.3d 1133, 
1136 (2010). The last two factors appear to be the most relevant
 
to our review. Dismissal thwarts the public policy of

 See generally Kalauli v. Lum, 57 Haw. 168, 170, 552 P.2d 355, 356
 
(1976) ("The filing of the motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis in the
present case satisfied the requirement of a notice of appeal by putting both
the trial court and the opposing party on notice of Appellant's intent to
appeal. The fact that the notice of appeal was not in a more conventional
form is not shown to have prejudiced Appellee in any way. Indeed, the parties
and the trial court, by proceeding with the motion for leave to appeal in
forma pauperis, demonstrated their mutual assumption that Appellant's right of
appeal had not been foreclosed. Our present determination merely confirms
this.")
 
12
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disposition on the merits, and per HRS § 371-4(k), the Board had
 
less drastic sanctions at its disposal if it determined such was
 needed to enforce its rules. Again, however, Appellants offered
 to sign the defective notice of appeal 20 days after it was
 brought to their attention and submitted a signed copy
 thereafter. The Board thus abused its discretion when it
 dismissed Appellants' appeal. See generally Becker v.
 
Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757, 760 (2001) (failure to sign the notice
 of appeal did not warrant dismissal where federal rule requiring
 signature permitted cure for an initial failure to meet the
 requirement "if the notice is timely filed and adequate in other
 respects, jurisdiction will vest in the court of appeals, where
 the case may proceed so long as the appellant promptly supplies
 the signature once the omission is called to his attention.")
 
This decision is not to be construed as holding the
 
Board is without authority to issue sanctions for non-compliance
 (or delayed compliance, as the case may be) with its rules. HRS
 § 371-4(k) provides:
 
(k) The [Board] may make or issue any order or take other
appropriate steps as may be necessary to enforce its rules and orders
and to carry into full effect the powers and duties given to it by law.
The [Board] may after notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard by
the board:
 
(1)	 Impose administrative sanctions; and
 
(2)	 Impose monetary sanctions of not more than $250 for
each offense against any person who is found to have
violated the board's rules or orders, which amounts
shall be deposited into the special compensation fund
created by section 386-151.
 
For the reasons discussed above, however, dismissal was not
 
appropriate.7
 
In short, the instant controversy could have been
 
avoided had the Board simply requested Appellants submit a signed
 copy of the notice of appeal.

 We note HAR § 12-47-48 provides additional sanction power when
conduct rises to the level of contempt or bad faith, or breaches reasonable
standards of orderly and ethical conduct. The record here does not support
such a finding.
