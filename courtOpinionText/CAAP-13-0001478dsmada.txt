(3) Thereafter, Appellant took no further action in
 
this appeal;
 
(4) Filing and docketing fees have not been paid, and
 
the record cannot be prepared without payment of the fees or an
 
order allowing Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis;
 
(5) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rules 11(b)(2), (c)(2). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed. Dated: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 19, 2013.
