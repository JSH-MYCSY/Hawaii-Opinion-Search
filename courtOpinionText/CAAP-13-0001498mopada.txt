(3) finding of no gift by David to the marital estate;

duration of alimony in view of the unequal property division; 
(5) failure to compensate Dorinda for a one-sided
 
property division by increasing the amount and/or duration of

by: 
(1) fashioning a premarital partnership based on an
 
illegal business venture, where the parties cohabitated but kept
 their finances separate prior to marriage;
 
(2) improperly considering David's inheritance related
 
to the division and distribution of property, and the related
 deviation from the Partnership Model;
 
(3) awarding Dorinda temporary alimony during the
 
pendency of the divorce proceeding; and
 
(4) awarding Dorinda attorneys' fees and costs.
I. BACKGROUND
 
In 1976, the parties met and began living together in 
Auckland, New Zealand. Dorinda had been studying art history in New Zealand and David was repairing a home and working on a reforestation project. Subsequently, they made their way to Winchester, Massachusetts, where they lived and worked together at a farm and store owned and operated by David's family. The parties then moved on to the island of Hawai
'i, where they lived 
until they moved to the island of O 'ahu in 1987. 
According to Dorinda, while on the island of Hawai 'i, 
David worked on a county road crew and began growing marijuana. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dorinda testified that she "was part of the processing and part
 
of the transportation of growing marijuana[.]" David testified
 however, that the parties did not have a joint or mutual
 marijuana operation.
 
In 1978, the parties purchased property in Pahoa, 
Hawai
'i for $17,000 and jointly constructed a two-story house on 
the property. Dorinda participated in building the house by setting up, buying supplies, making lunch for the workers, and painting. Dorinda testified that marijuana proceeds were used to jointly purchase the Pahoa property, an approximately nine acre parcel in Glenwood, Hawai
'i, titled under David, and another 
parcel in Volcano, Hawai 'i, titled under Dorinda. The Glenwood 
and Volcano properties were sold prior to the parties' marriage. David denied that any proceeds from marijuana sales were used to purchase real property. 
In 1978, the parties traveled to Thailand to look for 
orchids in order to establish an orchid company with other business partners. Upon their return to the island of Hawai
'i, 
however, Dorinda testified that she and David were no longer part of the prospective orchid company. Dorinda also testified they brought heroin back to Hawai
'i and that David sold a portion of 
it. David testified the parties smuggled heroin back to Hawai 'i 
but he did not sell or barter any of it. 
Prior to the marriage, the parties did not share a
 
joint checking account or file joint tax returns. David
 purchased property prior to the marriage, but did not use
 Dorinda's money or income. The family court found the parties
 financially supported each other during their cohabitation before
 marriage. The family court also found that David worked various
 jobs while Dorinda contributed services to the parties' living
 arrangement and also worked on David's parents' farm and store in
 Massachusetts.
 
On June 21, 1985, David and Dorinda were married in 
Hilo, Hawai
'i. The parties have two adult children. 
In 1987, the parties moved to the island of O 'ahu and 
purchased a home in Kaimuki for $59,000, which Dorinda testified 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was purchased with proceeds from their marijuana business. From
 
1987 to 1990, David worked various jobs and Dorinda was a stay-
at-home mother. The parties sold their Kaimuki home for $285,000
 and moved into a home they purchased in Waimea where they lived
 from 1990 to 1996. 
In 1996, the parties purchased land in Kamuela, Hawai
'i 
in the Anekona Subdivision and built a home (marital residence). 
The appraised value of the marital residence as of the DOCOEPOT 
was $635,000, with a mortgage and equity loan balance of $391,219 and net market value of $243,781. In 1996, the parties sold the Pahoa and Waimea homes. 
From approximately 1996 to 2009 Dorinda worked at the
 
schools her children attended. She was employed as an
 educational assistant and reading tutor, earning $2,000 a month,
 and at times health insurance and tuition waivers. Dorinda was
 laid off from the last school in 2009 and collected unemployment
 insurance benefits until September 2010, when she began working
 as a nanny for $1,600 per month.
 
In 2003, David opened his own general residential real
 
estate brokerage company, Hawaii Properties, USA LLC.; and since
 January 1, 2006, has been the president and designated realtor of
 the company. He stated the current compensation structure
 provided $1,000 per month plus commissions, but no commissions
 were paid since 2008.
 
In 2006, David and Dorinda agreed to take out a home
 
equity loan on the marital residence so that David could purchase
 the office (Kala Cottage) that he was using to run his real
 
estate business. David took out an initial credit line of
 
$100,000, using the marital residence as security, in order to
 keep the real estate business open and to pay the parties'
 expenses. Dorinda testified that under the agreement "David
 would repay the loan once he received inheritance from the
 passing of his father." The parties cosigned a second home
 equity line loan for $250,000. David testified that he would pay
 down the initial $100,000 debt as commissions came in. At the
 DOCOEPOT, approximately $250,000 was still owing on the debt.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Between 2007 and 2011, David inherited from his 
parents' estates various amounts totaling $3,550,770. David 
deposited these monies into his separate account at the Bank of Hawai
'i (Inheritance Account). The Inheritance Account had a 
DOCOEPOT value of $2,051,293 and the family court considered it David's separate property. 
Between November 21, 2007 and October 22, 2010, 
various amounts were disbursed from the Inheritance Account
 including $180,000 for the purchase of Kala Cottage. Dorinda's
 expert witness, Gary Kuba (Kuba), a certified public accountant,
 
testified that $461,516 was transferred from the Inheritance
 
Account to the joint checking account and used to pay inheritance
 taxes. Kuba examined records of the Inheritance Account, the
 parties' joint checking account, a Hawaii Properties account, and
 a David Curtis Hamilton Personal Account. Kuba testified: 
There [was] nine hundred twenty-six thousand transferred out
of [the Inheritance Account] into the joint checking
account, three hundred fifty thousand into the David Curtis
Hamilton personal account. . . . [T]wo hundred fourteen
thousand was transferred into the Hawaii Properties Account
. . . . And in addition to that, there was a $180,000 wire
transfer for the [Kala] cottage purchase, twenty-five
thousand transferred into CardEx, LLC, and then another
fifty thousand transferred to Vanguard. 
On June 23, 2010, Dorinda filed a Complaint for
 
Divorce. On July 6, 2010, Dorinda filed a Motion and Declaration
 
for Temporary Relief, seeking, in part, a restraining order and
 temporary alimony. On July 6, 2010, the family court filed its
 Order to Show Cause for Temporary Relief (Restraining Order),
 
which enjoined David from "wasting, transferring, encumbering, or
 
otherwise disposing of marital assets" and restrained him from
 contacting Dorinda and their daughter.
 
On September 20, 2010, the family court amended its
 
Restraining Order to exclude the prohibition against David's
 contact with Elizabeth. On November 10, 2010, the family court
 entered its Order on Plaintiff's Motion and Declaration for
 Temporary Relief and Order to Show Cause for Temporary Relief
 Filed July 6, 2010 (Order re: Temporary Relief and OSC). Under
 
this order, both parties were restrained from wasting marital
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assets. Dorinda was permitted to be the sole occupant of the
 
marital residence and was given sole and exclusive use of a 2009
 Suzuki 4x4 (used car). David was required to: (1) pay for the
 
parties' and children's medical and dental insurance premiums and
 
any uncovered expenses and overages; (2) pay the mortgage, all
 insurances, lines of credit, and other fees associated with the
 marital residence; (3) make the car loan payments on all of the
 parties' cars; (4) pay all the utilities and be responsible for
 the credit card debt; (5) pay for the children's higher education
 expenses; and (6) pay $2,000 per month in spousal support
 beginning October 1, 2010.
 
On February 13, 2013, the family court filed its Order
 
Re: Divorce Trial Held on December 22 and 23, 2011 (Order Re:
 
Divorce Trial). The family court found the parties had formed a
 
premarital economic partnership in 1976 lasting until they
 
married in 1985. The parties had no written premarital or post­marital agreement. 
The family court found David's inheritance of
 
$3,550,770 had a DOCOEPOT value of $2,051,293 and that these
 remaining monies were David's marital separate property (MSP). 
The family court also found David had withdrawn $1,499,477 from
 
the Inheritance Account and determined that these were Category 3
 capital contributions to the marital partnership. The family
 court also made the following relevant findings: 
29. Further, in January 2009, [David] received a cash
gift from his mother in the amount of $12,000 and this is
also considered a Category 3 capital contribution credit. 
30. [David] purchased a saddle valued at $10,000
before he met [Dorinda] in New Zealand. He still own[ed]
the saddle at DOCOEPOT. Its value continues to be $10,000.
This is considered a Category 1 capital contribution credit.
 
31. [David's] total Category 1 and 3 contribution
credit is $1,521,477 ($1,499,477 + $12,000 + $10,000).
 
The family court's allocation chart reflected the total
 
value of the parties' assets as $466,522; David's capital
 
contribution as $1,521,477, and Dorinda's entitlement as (-)
 $500,081.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The family court found funds withdrawn from David's
 
Inheritance Account were "used for multiple purposes including
 
assisting the family and the family's lifestyle," but that
 Dorinda did not meet her burden of showing that David intended to
 make a gift of these funds to her.
 
In regard to the marital residence, the family court
 
made the following findings:
 
37. The marital residence is Category 5 property.
 
38. It would be just and equitable that [David] be awarded
the marital residence, subject to all encumbrances thereon. 
39. It would be just and equitable that [Dorinda] vacates
the marital residence within 60 days of the filing of the divorce
decree. 
40. Further, [David] shall take all necessary steps to
remove [Dorinda] as a responsible party from both the mortgage and
equity loan within 60 days of the filing of the divorce decree.
 
The family court determined sufficient valid and
 
relevant considerations (VARCs) existed to justify an equitable
 
deviation from marital partnership principles and that it would
 
be just and equitable to give Dorinda a credit of an amount equal
 to her equalization payment, which the Allocation Chart reflected
 to be $527,477. The family court considered the following in
 support of its equitable deviation: 
57. . . . [Dorinda's] equalization payment to [David] is
substantial.
 
58. [David's MSP] and Category 1 and 3 capital contribution
credits far exceed the value of the property that is being
allocated between the parties. 
[. . . . ]
 
60. [Dorinda] is 57 years old and has been employed from
time to time at little over minimum wage over the years that
parties have been together. She needs further assistance to meet
 her needs at the lifestyle she has been accustomed to during the
years the parties resided together. 
61. [David] is 59 years old, has worked all his life, has
owned and operated several businesses, and has sufficient assets
to support himself very well for a number of years. 
62. [David's] employability is much better than
[Dorinda's]. 
63. [David] is entitled [to] a substantial capital
contribution credit due [to] his Category 1 and 3 assets.
[Dorinda] will be left with comparably very nominal assets. 
7
  
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Further, [David] has substantial [MSP] he inherited from his
parents' estates.
 
64. The parties started their [pre-marital economic
partnership] in 1976 and have resided together for about 34 years.
This is a relatively long relationship. 
In regard to spousal support, the Order Re: Divorce
 
Trial including the following findings: 
68. The parties have lived together since 1976 and
separated in 2010. Over these approximate 34 years, they have
enjoyed a modest life style; raising children together, purchasing
and selling real property, operating several businesses, building
the marital residence, etc. [David] was the primary bread winner.
Although [Dorinda] worked from time to time, she remained
primarily a homemaker the majority of the time and generally
stayed at home to raise the parties' children and to support the
family. The children attended private school and they are now
adults.
 
69. When [Dorinda] was laid off from Parker School in 2009,
she began receiving unemployment benefits. In 2011 she found work
 as a nanny and makes approximately $1,600 gross a month. 
70. [David] inherited over 3.5 million dollars from his
parents' estates resulting in the parties enjoying a relatively
higher standard of living. [Dorinda] enjoyed regular therapy,
massages, new clothing, and elective cosmetic dental work.
[David] enjoyed an expensive vintage car and multiple trips to
Southeast Asia. They built a modest home together. 
71. [Dorinda] has received $2,000 per month in court-
ordered temporary spousal support. 
72. [Dorinda] is employable, albeit limited, because of her
age. 
73. After divorce, [Dorinda] will, however need continued
support to pay for her health insurance and other medical expenses
as well as to assist her in other daily and monthly expenses. 
74. Following the divorce, [Dorinda] will no longer have
the benefit of residing at the marital residence. She will now
 need further financial assistance. 
75. [David] currently spends about $12,000 per month for
family support. He will not live at the marital residence. His
 monthly expenses will go down. 
76. It would be just and equitable to award [Dorinda]
continued spousal support for a period of five years commencing
January 2012 (the month following trial), as follows: $2,000 per
month until [Dorinda] moves out of the marital residence, then
$3,000 per month commencing the first month after [Dorinda] moves
out of the marital residence through December 2017. 
The Order Re: Divorce Trial also found it just and
 
equitable to allow David to claim Elizabeth as a dependent on his
 
tax returns.
 
8

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Order Re: Divorce Trial included a finding of
 
David's "superior financial condition" and on that basis awarded
 
Dorinda "attorney's fees and costs in the amount of up to
 $5,000."
 
On February 25, 2013, Dorinda filed a Motion for
 
Reconsideration. Also on February 25, 2013, David filed a Motion
 for Reconsideration and/or Amendment of Order Re: Divorce Trial
 Held on December 22 and 23, 2011 (filed on February 13, 2013).
 
On May 10, 2013, the family court entered its Order Re:
 
Motions for Reconsideration (Reconsideration Order). The
 
Reconsideration Order amended the Order Re: Divorce Trial to
 
grant in part and deny in part David's motion for reconsideration
 by amending Finding No. 76 to state: 
It would be just and equitable to award [Dorinda] continued
spousal support for a period of five years commencing January 2012
(the month folling the trial), as follows: $2,000 per month until
[Dorinda] moves out of the marital residence, then $3,000 per
month commencing the first month after [Dorinda] moves out of the
marital residence and through December 2016. Spousal support
shall terminate upon [Dorinda's] remarriage or upon the death of
either [David] or [Dorinda].
 
The family court also substituted David's allocation
 
chart for the family court's allocation chart and amended David's
 
chart to eliminate the contribution credit for David's saddle
 valued at $10,000 and retitled the chart, "Amended Property
 Allocation Chart."
 
The Reconsideration Order also amended Finding No. 49
 
and Finding No. 54 as follows: 
c. Finding No. 49 shall be amended, as follows: "It would
be just and equitable that the bank accounts, securities,
retirement accounts, and pensions titled in the parties'
individual names be awarded to that party as their sole and
separate property. [David] is also awarded the Bank of Hawaii
joint checking account, #0138. The values are as noted in
 the . . . Amended Property Allocation Chart." 
d. Finding No. 54 shall be amended, as follows: "It would
be just and equitable that [Dorinda] be awarded all of the
itemized art, furniture, and furnishings requested by her on Page
13 of her Closing Argument filed January 31, 2012. [David] shall
be awarded the dishwasher, gas stove, microwave, refrigerator,
washer/dryer and the second koa office hair [sic] located in the
master bedroom of the marital residence. No credible evidence was
 
presented as to the value of these items.
"

On May 30, 2013, Dorinda's counsel, submitted a
 
declaration of fees and costs pursuant to the Order Re: Divorce
 
Trial.

Decree (Divorce Decree), dissolving the parties' marriage and
 
dividing their property. Parts one through four of the divorce
 
decree concerned the granting of divorce, identification of the

 Five concerned property division between the parties. Parts six
 through thirteen concerned parties' responsibilities for legal
 fees, tax matters, future acquisitions, contemplated conveyances
 and cooperation, enforcement of the divorce decree, a disclaimer
 regarding paragraph headings used in the divorce decree,
 Dorinda's surname, and other matters, respectively.
 
On June 19, 2013, Dorinda filed a timely notice of
 
appeal. David filed a timely notice of cross-appeal on July 2,
 2013.
 
On August 14, 2013, the family court filed its Order
 
Re: Fees and Costs, which ordered David to pay Dorinda's attorney
 $5,000.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
Property Division
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
When dividing property in a divorce case, the family
court is required to consider all circumstances of the case,
exercise its discretion, and make a "just and equitable"
division of property. [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)]
§ 580–47 (1976, as amended). For an appellate court to
conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion, it must
appear that the trial court clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.
 
Raupp v. Raupp, 3 Haw. App. 602, 609, 658 P.2d 329, 335 (1983)
 
(quoting Ahlo v. Ahlo, 1 Haw. App. 324, 619 P.2d 112 (1980)). 
"Undue emphasis on a particular factor is abuse of
 
discretion" in division of property by trial court upon divorce
 under HRS § 580-47. Ahlo, 1 Haw. App. at 329, 619 P.2d at 117
 
(citing Carson v. Carson, 50 Haw. 182, 436 P.2d 7 (1967)).
 
"We review the family court's final division and 
distribution of the estate of the parties under the abuse of discretion standard, in view of the factors set forth in HRS § 580-47 and partnership principles." Tougas v. Tougas, 76 
Hawai
'i 19, 26, 868 P.2d 437, 444 (1994) (footnote, citation, and 
internal quotation marks omitted).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. David's cross-appeal
 
1.
 
David contends the family court erred by fashioning a
 
premarital economic partnership around an illegal marijuana-sales
 enterprise. The family court found, "[i]n 1977, the parties
 started growing marijuana and both worked growing, processing,
 transporting the finished product, and selling it." David raised
 this error to the family court through his Amended Position
 Statement, filed November 7, 2011, which stated, "[Dorinda]
 testified that her basis for and what she relies on to form a
 pre-marital economic partnership was a joint, illegal partnership
 with [David] to cultivate and distribute marijuana."
 
"[A] premarital economic partnership is formed when, 
prior to their subsequent marriage, two people cohabit and apply their financial resources as well as their individual energies to and for the benefit of each other's person, assets, and liabilities." Collins v. Wassell, 133 Hawai
'i 34, 45, 323 P.3d 
1216, 1227 (2014) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citing Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai 'i 508, 515, 122 P.3d 288, 
295 (App. 2005)). The formation of a premarital economic 
partnership depends on the parties' intentions to do so. Collins, 113 Hawai
'i at 45, 323 P.3d at 1227. In the absence of 
an express agreement, the family court must consider the "totality of the circumstances, including both the economic and non-economic contributions of the parties" to determine whether parties intended to form a premarital economic partnership. Collins, 133 Hawai
'i at 46, 323 P.3d at 1228. Relevant 
considerations include "joint acts of a financial nature, the duration of cohabitation, whether — and the extent to which — finances were commingled, economic and non-economic contributions to the household for the couple's mutual benefit, and how the couple treated finances before and after marriage." Collins, 133 
Hawai
'i at 46, 323 P.3d at 1228. 
The family court considered the parties' joint 
financial acts, cohabitation since 1976, economic and non­economic contributions, and other financial arrangements in finding that the parties formed a premarital economic partnership in 1976, "[t]hey cohabitated and applied their financial resources, energies, and efforts to and for each other's benefit and for their acquired joint assets and liabilities." One basis for the family court's finding of a premarital economic partnership, however, was the parties' "growing, processing, transporting the finished product, and selling" marijuana in 1977. The possession, distribution, or manufacture of marijuana is illegal in Hawai
'i. See HRS §§ 712-1240 (1993 and Supp. 
2013), 712-1249.4 (1993), 712-1249.5 (1993). "A partnership formed for illegal purposes or to pursue a lawful purpose in an unlawful manner, is invalid and unenforceable." 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership § 50 at 232 (2003) (footnotes omitted). 
The existence of a premarital economic partnership is 
relevant to the family court's division of the parties' property. Collins, 133 Hawai
'i 34, 41-42, 323 P.3d 1216, 1223-24 (2014) 
("[I]n dividing and distributing property pursuant to HRS § 580–47, premarital contributions are a relevant consideration 
12
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where the parties cohabited and formed a premarital economic
 
partnership."). The family court was required to consider the
 following factors in dividing property between the parties: 
(1) Financial resources of the parties; 
(2) Ability of the party seeking support and maintenance to meet
his or her needs independently; 
(3) Duration of the marriage; 
(4) Standard of living established during the marriage; 
(5) Age of the parties; 
(6) Physical and emotional condition of the parties; 
(7) Usual occupation of the parties during the marriage; 
(8) Vocational skills and employability of the party seekingsupport and maintenance; 
(9) Needs of the parties; 
(10) Custodial and child support responsibilities; 
(11) Ability of the party from whom support and maintenance issought to meet his or her own needs while meeting the needsof the party seeking support and maintenance; 
(12) Other factors which measure the financial condition in which the parties will be left as the result of theaction under which the determination of maintenance is made; and 
(13) Probable duration of the need of the party seeking supportand maintenance. 
HRS § 580-47(a).
 
HRS § 580-47 confers "wide discretion upon the family
 
court." Gussin v. Gussin , 73 Haw. 470, 479, 836 P.2d 484, 489
 
(1992). "[HRS §] 580–47 gives to the family court the discretion
 
to divide marital property according to what is just and
 equitable[.]" Gussin, 73 Haw. at 479, 836 P.2d at 489 (citations
 
and internal quotation marks omitted, format altered). The
 family court's equitable powers, however, did not authorize it to 
provide relief to parties to an illegal agreement. 
Equity will not interpose to grant relief to parties
to an illegal agreement. In fact, where an agreement is
founded on a consideration that is illegal, immoral, or
against public policy, a court will leave the parties where
it finds them. Ordinarily, equitable relief is denied where
the parties are in pari delicto. Accordingly, as a general
rule, equity will grant no affirmative relief to a party to
an illegal contract who is in pari delicto. Generally,
equity will aid neither party to an illegal contract by
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
decreeing cancellation if they are in pari delicto, that is,
equally at fault, but will leave them where it finds them,
to settle the dispute without the aid of the court. 
27A Am. Jur. 2d Equity § 47 at 588 (2008) (footnotes omitted). 
Courts have generally refused to enforce illegal
 
agreements for sound public policy reasons: 
The reason for this refusal is not that the courts are
 unaware of possible injustice between the parties, and that
the defendant may be left in possession of some benefit he
should in good conscience turn over to the plaintiff, but
that this consideration is outweighed by the importance of
deterring illegal conduct. Knowing that they will receive
no help from the courts and must trust completely to each
other's good faith, the parties are less likely to enter an
illegal arrangement in the first place.
 
Lewis & Queen v. N. M. Ball Sons, 48 Cal.2d 141, 150, 308 P.2d
 
713 (1957). 
In answer to David's contention that no premarital
 
economic partnership existed by reason of the illegal marijuana
 operation, Dorinda notes the family court did not expressly find
 the parties' premarital economic partnership was based on an
 illegal enterprise. Dorinda refers to record evidence of her
 noneconomic premarital contributions of labor to David's tree-
planting project in New Zealand, David's family grocery store,
 the construction of the parties' Pahoa house, travel to Thailand
 to research a prospective orchid business, and other factors upon
 which a legitimate premarital economic partnership could have
 been based. Dorinda cites David's testimony to support the
 proposition that "marijuana was 'just a sideline with a few
 friends,'" "[t]he couple's pre-[date of marriage] properties were
 purchased entirely with 'savings,'" and that his "testimony was
 entirely inconsistent with his present claim that 'the illegal
 business was the foundation of the [premarital economic
 partnership]."
 
In response, David states, "[i]t was Dorinda who
 
testified that the marijuana business was the factual predicate
 underlying the [premarital economic partnership] . . . [and]
 Dorinda stated the funds gained from that [marijuana] enterprise
 benefited [sic] the parties and accounted, at least in some part,
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to their joint earnings and assets since they did sell 'the
 
finished product[.]'"
 
The fact that the parties' illegal marijuana operation 
provided funds for their premarital economic partnership was not determinative of whether the partnership was valid. No evidence presented reasonably supported a finding, that the purpose of the parties' premarital cohabitation and financial arrangements was the growing and sale of marijuana. We therefore reject David's contention that the "illegal business was the foundation of the [premarital economic partnership]." Evidence of the parties' premarital non-marijuana operations would suffice to support a finding that a premarital economic partnership existed between the parties. The family court's Order Re: Divorce Trial contained findings regarding Dorinda's work on David's family's farm and store, the prospective orchid business, the parties' cohabitation since 1976, and various short-term financial arrangements that independently supported the determination that a premarital economic partnership existed as a matter of law. The record shows that from 1976 to 1985, the parties "cohabit[ed] and appl[ied] their financial resources as well as their individual energies to and for the benefit of each other's person, assets, and liabilities" so as to have formed a premarital economic partnership. Collins, 133 Hawai
'i at 45, 323 
P.3d at 1227. 
Although the conclusion that a premarital partnership
 
existed was not an error, the family court's finding that the
 parties' marijuana operation was part of that premarital economic
 partnership did constitute an error as a matter of law. The
 family court should have segregated the illegal marijuana
 operation from its consideration of the parties' alleged
 premarital economic partnership. 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership
 § 52 at 233 provides:
 
§ 52 Separation of mixed legal and illegal purposes
 
. . . .
 
Where a partnership's illegal purpose is not
pervasive, and legitimate objectives can be segregated, the
partnership is valid and enforceable to the extent that its
objectives are found lawful. The unlawful objectives must
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
be severable from the lawful ones. The test is whether the
 
illegality infects and destroys the agreement as a whole, or
whether the promise to be enforced is only remotely or
collaterally related to the illegal transaction and not
illegal in and of itself. The fact that a partnership
engages in illegal business activities as a merely
incidental part of its primary business does not suffice to
invalidate the partnership as a legal entity and preclude
the right of accounting for partnership assets received
primarily through the legitimate activities of the
partnership.
 
The fact that a particular partnership project is illegal
does not render the partnership agreement unenforceable where that
project is only one of numerous partnership activities, is never
carried out, and the partnership was not formed for the purpose of
carrying on an illegal business or for the purpose of conducting a
lawful business in an unlawful manner.
 
(Footnotes omitted.) 
The parties' premarital economic partnership was valid
 
to the extent that it included legal partnership activities and
 
its "legitimate objectives" can be segregated from the illegal
 marijuana business. Id. 
The marijuana business was a contributor of property to
 
the parties' premarital economic partnership and, at least
 according to Dorinda, provided funds for the purchase of the
 Kaimuki property that was later sold for $285,000. The family
 court found the parties grew, processed, and sold marijuana in
 1977; jointly purchased a $17,000 property; and jointly bought
 and sold other properties. Dorinda testified that jointly
 purchased properties were funded by monies from the marijuana
 business and David denied that any proceeds from marijuana sales
 were used to purchase real property. Segregating the economic
 contribution of the marijuana operation to the parties'
 premarital economic partnership, however, would require a
 credibility determination regarding Dorinda's and David's
 testimony as to whether proceeds from the marijuana operations
 were used to purchase the Pahoa, Glenwood, Volcano, and Kaimuki
 properties and, further, ascertaining how the proceeds from the
 subsequent sales of those properties were allocated to marital
 and legitimate premarital assets. 
For these reasons, we vacate the family court's divorce
 
decree, in part, and remand with instructions to re-assess the
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
parties' property divisions in consideration of a premarital
 
economic partnership, excluding the parties' marijuana
 operations. 
2.
 
David's second contention is that the family court
 
erred by categorizing and distributing marital property and
 deviating from the Partnership Model by considering his inherited
 properties. The family court found the duration of the parties'
 premarital economic partnership a valid and relevant
 consideration that supported its decision to apply equitable
 deviation. Because we conclude the family court's finding of a
 premarital economic partnership based in part on an illegal
 marijuana business was reversible error, the family court's
 application of its finding that a premarital partnership existed
 to support deviation from the Partnership Model constituted
 reversible error to the extent the deviation was based on the
 illegal marijuana business. 
3.
 
David's third contention on cross-appeal is that the
 
family court erred by awarding Dorinda temporary alimony in the
 amount of $2,000 per month during the pendency of the divorce. 
David contends the family court should not have considered
 David's ability to pay the temporary alimony award from monies he
 inherited. 
In its Order re: Temporary Relief and OSC, the family
 
court found 
[David] has historically used his existing inheritance funds
for payment of the marital expenses and [Dorinda's] support.
Having reviewed [Dorinda's] income and expense statement
filed, the [family court] finds that it would be just and
equitable to order that in addition to the above support
orders, [David] shall pay to [Dorinda] $2000 per month in
temporary spousal support beginning October 1, 2010.
 
David contends the family court should not have required David to
 
pay temporary alimony from his inheritance funds for the same
 reasons that the family court was not authorized to distribute
 marital separate property to Dorinda.
 
MSP is property owned by one or both of the spouses at
 
the time of the divorce and includes property: (1) excluded from
 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the marital partnership by a valid premarital agreement; (2) 
excluded from the marital partnership by a valid contract; (3) "acquired by the spouse-owner during the marriage by gift or inheritance, . . . was expressly classified by the donee/heir­spouse-owner as his or her separate property, and . . . was maintained by itself and/or sources other than one or both of the spouses and funded by sources other than marital partnership income or property." Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i 126, 147, 
276 P.3d 695, 716 (2012) (citations and emphasis omitted). 
The family court was authorized to order temporary
 
support for Dorinda "as the court may deem fair and
 reasonable . . . ." HRS § 580-9 (1993). "[F]inancial resources
 of the husband" are given "due consideration" in awarding the
 spouse temporary support. Richards v. Richards, 44 Haw. 491,
 
496-97, 355 P.2d 188, 193 (1960). There was no abuse of
 discretion in the family court's consideration of David's
 financial resources in ordering temporary spousal support for
 Dorinda. 
4.
 
David's final contention is that the family court erred
 
by awarding Dorinda attorneys' fees and costs. Similar to his
 argument regarding the family court's award of temporary alimony,
 David contends the family court abused its discretion by
 fashioning an award that required him to "invade" what would
 eventually be categorized as his separate property. He further
 contends the family court lacked jurisdiction to award Dorinda an
 additional $5,000 in attorneys' fees in its August 14, 2013 Order
 Re: Fees and Costs because the parties' notices of appeal and
 cross-appeal had already been filed.
 
Under HRS § 580-9, the family court was authorized to
 
award Dorinda attorneys' fees during the pendency of the divorce
 proceeding. See Cain v. Cain, 59 Haw. 32, 42, 575 P.2d 468, 476
 
(1978). The award of attorney's fees was within the family
 court's "sound discretion" and was "limited only by the standard
 that it be fair and reasonable." Cain, 59 Haw. at 43, 575 P.2d 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 476. David contends the family court's total award of $60,450
 
in attorneys' fees during the pendency of the divorce proceedings
 constituted reversible error because it required him to use his
 "separate property inheritance[.]" David points to no authority
 for this proposition and we find none. 
Likewise, we find no error in the family court's orders
 
allocating responsibility for attorneys' fees and costs amongst
 the parties upon granting the divorce. HRS § 580-47(a)(3) "vests
 in the trial court the discretion to divide all of the property
 of the parties, whether community, joint or separate according to
 what is just and equitable." Cassiday v. Cassiday, 68 Haw. 383,
 
386, 716 P.2d 1133, 1136 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted
 and emphasis added). Under HRS § 580-47(a)(3), the family court
 was authorized to make further orders that finally divided and
 distributed David's remaining inheritance monies regardless of
 whether they were "community, joint, or separate" property. Id. 
Further, in issuing orders regarding attorneys' fees

 
and costs and other matters, HRS § 580-47(a) provides:
 
580-47 Support orders; division of property.  (a) Upon
granting a divorce . . . (4) . . . the court shall take into
consideration: the respective merits of the parties, the relative
abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will
be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for
the benefit of the children of the parties, the concealment of or
failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation of a
restraining order[.]
 
The family court was required to consider, among other
 
factors, the condition each party would be left by the divorce,
 
and this factor was not restricted to the condition of a party in
 isolation from their marital separate property resources. The
 family court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Dorinda
 $5,000 in attorneys' fees and costs in its Order Re: Divorce
 Trial. 
Nor was the family court's August 14, 2013 Order Re: 
Fees and Costs void for lack of jurisdiction. Generally, "the filing of a valid notice of appeal transfers all jurisdiction in the case to the appellate court and deprives all family courts of jurisdiction to proceed further in the case, except for some matters." Lowther v. Lowther, 99 Hawai
'i 569, 578, 57 P.3d 494, 
19
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
503 (App. 2002) (quoting In re Doe, 81 Hawai 'i 91, 98, 912 P.2d 
588, 595 (App. 1996)). "[E]xceptional matters are collateral or 
incidental matters[,]" and these include: 
the right to enforce the judgment, matters specified in HRS
§ 571-54 (1993) and § 580-47 (Supp. 2001), the right underHFCR Rule 60(b) to correct, modify, or grant relief from thejudgment but to do so in accordance with the procedure
stated in Life of the Land v. Ariyoshi, 57 Haw. 249, 553
P.2d 464 (1976), and the right under Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 10(e) to correct or modifythe record on appeal. 
Lowther, 99 Hawai 'i at 578, 57 P.3d at 503 (citing TSA Intern. 
Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai 'i 243, 256, 990 P.2d 713, 726 
(1999)). 
The family court's August 14, 2013 Order Re: Fees and 
Costs confirmed the $5,000 award that had already been set in the
 
February 13, 2013 Order Re: Divorce Trial, which awarded Dorinda
 "up to $5,000" in attorneys' fees and costs.
B. Dorinda's appeal
 
Dorinda contends the family court reversibly erred by
 
finding the approximately $1.5 million David spent during the
 marriage constituted Category 3 Marital Partnership Property
 (MPP) capital contributions; crediting David for these
 
contributions against the parties' approximately $450,000
 
Category 5 marital estate; consequently producing a $1.1 million
 marital loss for which Dorinda would be liable for an
 approximately $550,000 equalization payment. The family court
 found sufficient VARCs existed to justify an equitable deviation
 from partnership principles and thus gave Dorinda a credit equal
 to her equalization payment. Dorinda argued to the family court
 that this deviation was not a "meaningful equitable deviation,"
 and contended it did not arrive at a fair division of the
 parties' original marital assets. Dorinda contends one of the
 following remedies was appropriate:
 
1. If the entire $3.5 million inheritance is deemed MSP,
then none was properly used to reduce the couple's $450,000
marital estate, which should be divided equally under the
Partnership Model or awarded primarily to Dorinda by equitable
deviation. 
2. If all David's inheritance is deemed MPP Category
3, the $2 million balance should be returned to him, but
 
20
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
none [of] the $1.5 million spent during the marriage would
be credited to David or deducted from the Category 5 marital
estate, either because the expenditures constituted gifts to
the marital estate, or non-marital expenses such as the
payment of taxes, or by applying equitable deviation and
declining to reduce the size of the divisible Category 5
marital estate. 
3. If David's inheritance is in fact a mixture of 60%
 
MSP and 40% MPP, which is how the court ruled, then it
should utilize the same approach regarding contribution
credits, awarding David his MSP, and excluding credits for
family gifts and non-marital expenditures, and deviating
from partnership principles by declining to reduce the size
of the divisible marital estate.
 
4. Finally, as a last resort, if the family court
utilizes David's inheritance to eliminate the marital estate, and awards him 98% of this couple's joint andseparate property, $2.5 million to David and $27,000 toDorinda, the court should compensate Dorinda for thisone-sided property division, by altering and increasing theamount and/or duration of alimony, as suggested in [Tougas,76 Hawai' i at 27, 868 P.2d at 445] "based on the respective
separate conditions of the spouses." 
According to Dorinda, "David's strategy effectively
 
insulated all $2.5 million owned by this couple at DOCOEPOT from
 
equitable deviation, leaving Dorinda, despite a finding that
 deviation was justified and necessary, with only a used car and a
 $13,000 IRA."
 
In determining the equitable division of MPP, the
 
family court can 
"utilize the construct of five categories of net market values
[(NMV)] in divorce cases:
 
Category 1. The net market value (NMV), plus or minus,
 
of all property separately owned by one spouse on the
 
date of marriage (DOM) but excluding the NMV
attributable to property that is subsequently legally
gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to both
spouses, or to a third party.
 
Category 2. The increase in the NMV of all property
 
whose NMV on the DOM is included in category 1 and
 
that the owner separately owns continuously from the
 DOM to the DOCOEPOT . . . .
 
Category 3. The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or
minus, of property separately acquired by gift or
inheritance during the marriage but excluding the NMV
attributable to property that is subsequently legally
gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to both
spouses, or to a third party.
 
Category 4. The increase in the NMV of all property
whose NMV on the date of acquisition during the
marriage is included in category 3 and that the owner
separately owns continuously from the date of
 
21
  Under the Partnership Model, family courts generally
 
award parties his or her capital contributions and split the
 
distribution of appreciated value. Kakinami,  127 Hawai 'i at 147, 
131 n.4, 276 P.3d at 700 n.4. The family court is further guided
 by partnership principles in governing division and distribution:
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
acquisition to the DOCOEPOT.
 
Category 5. The difference between the NMVs, plus or
minus, of all property owned by one or both of the
spouses on the DOCOEPOT minus the NMVs, plus or minus,
includable in categories 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 
Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai 'i 508, 512, 122 P.3d 288, 292 (App. 
2005) (quoting Malek v. Malek, 7 Haw. App. 377, 380–81 n.1, 768
 
P.2d 243, 246–47 n.1 (1989)).
 
Under general partnership law, "each partner is entitled to
be repaid his contributions to the partnership property,whether made by way of capital or advances." Absent a legally permissible and binding partnership agreement to thecontrary, "partners share equally in the profits of theirpartnership, even though they may have contributed unequallyto capital or services." Hawai' i partnership law provides
in relevant part as follows: 
Rules determining rights and duties of partners. The rights
and duties of the partners in relation to the partnership
shall be determined, subject to any agreement between them,
by the following rules:
 
(a) Each partner shall be repaid the partner's contributions,
whether by way of capital or advances to the partnership property
and share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all
liabilities, including those to partners, are satisfied; and must
contribute towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise,
sustained by the partnership according to the partner's share in
the profits.

 (1991) (quoting HRS § 425–118(a) (1985)).
 
Dorinda contends the family court erred by excluding
 
David's remaining inheritance from distribution between the
 parties. Dorinda relies on cases interpreting HRS § 580-47(a),
 which allows the family court to "make further orders as shall
 appear just and equitable . . . finally dividing and distributing
 the estate of the parties . . . whether community, joint, or
 separate[.]" Citing

22

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
authorities provided that the family court would have acted
 
within its discretion if it had distributed part of David's
 inheritance to Dorinda to achieve a "just and equitable" result. 
Carson, 50 Haw. at 184, 436 P.2d at 9.
 
Dorinda contends the family court erred by categorizing
 
inheritance monies David spent during the marriage as capital
 contributions. She challenges the family court's Finding No. 26,
 which states that David used his inheritance to "support and
 maintain the family and the family's lifestyle." In his answer,
 David refers to his testimony that stated he used monies he
 withdrew from the Inheritance Account "to take care of his
 family" and specified that he expended these funds on "marital
 bills" such as the children's education, and to pay for the
 family's visit to Boston. 
The family court's treatment of David's spent and 
unspent inheritance funds as MSP implicated its equitable powers under HRS § 580-47(a). The family court's determination that a premarital economic partnership existed was a "relevant consideration" in determining equitable distribution of the parties' property upon granting the divorce. Collins, 133 
Hawai
'i at 42, 323 P.3d at 1224; Chen v. Hoeflinger, 127 Hawai 'i 
346, 359, 279 P.3d 11, 24 (App. 2012), as corrected (Mar. 12, 2012) ("[A] family court can consider the parties' contributions during the premarital economic partnership if premarital cohabitation matured into marriage." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). The family court did not abuse its discretion in determining that David could be credited for expenditures from the Inheritance Account for household expenses. 
However, the family court's equitable division of the
 
parties' property relied, in part, on its finding of a premarital
 economic partnership that included an illegal marijuana
 operation. Because the family court's premarital economic
 partnership finding was in error, its subsequent reliance on that
 premarital economic partnership to justify equitable deviation
 constitutes reversible error. Likewise, the family court's
 finding of a premarital economic partnership was implicated in
 
23
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the decision to treat David's inheritance as MSP. Because the
 
family court erred by considering property based on an illegal
 marijuana operation, we decline to affirm its findings regarding
 the parties' property division. 
Dorinda raises several related contentions regarding 
the family court's alimony award. She contends that the alimony
 award constitutes reversible error because the family court
 "should have considered granting her lifetime alimony of $5,000 a
 month." Such an alimony award, Dorinda argues, could have
 "cure[d] an unfair property division caused by [MSP.]"
 
The family court considered factors enumerated in HRS
 
§ 580-47(a) in determining its alimony award to Dorinda: (1)
 Dorinda's income and David's 3.5 million dollar inheritance; (2)
 Dorinda's limited employability; (3) the 34-year span of their
 premarital and marital relationship; (4) the parties' relatively
 higher standard of living after David received his inheritance;
 (5) the impact of Dorinda's age on her employability; (6) 
Dorinda's medical expenses; (7) Dorinda's occupations during the
 marriage; (8) Dorinda's employability; (9) Dorinda's continued
 need for health insurance and medical and other expenses; (10) 
David's $12,000 per month expenditures on family support; (11)
 David's increased ability to pay alimony consequent to moving
 into the marital home; and (12) Dorinda's increased need for
 financial assistance upon moving out of the marital home. In
 addition to considering required factors, the family court was
 required to "order support and maintenance for a period
 sufficient to allow completion of the training, education,
 skills, or other activity, and shall allow, in addition,
 sufficient time for the party to secure appropriate employment." 
HRS § 580-47(a). The family court considered all required
 factors and determined Dorinda would be able to find employment
 to support herself by the end of December 2016.
 
The family court specifically found the parties "lived
 
together since 1976 and separated in 2010" and further stated,
 "[o]ver these approximate 34 years, they have enjoyed a modest
 life style; raising children together, purchasing and selling
 
24
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
real property, operating several businesses, building the marital
 
residence, etc." The family court did not specify whether the
 parties' premarital operation of "several businesses" or real
 property purchases included the illegal marijuana operation or
 real properties allegedly purchased from marijuana operation
 proceeds. Insofar as Dorinda's alimony award may have been
 premised, in part, on premarital activities connected to the
 illegal marijuana operations, we also vacate the alimony award as
 reversible error. Upon remand, the family court should exclude
 from its determination of Dorinda's alimony award any
 consideration of those premarital economic activities connected
 to the marijuana operation.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We vacate no. 4. "Alimony" and no. 5 "Property
 
Division," of the June 7, 2013 Divorce Decree entered in Family
 Court of the Third Circuit's and remand this case for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm all other
 parts of the June 7, 2013 Divorce Decree.
