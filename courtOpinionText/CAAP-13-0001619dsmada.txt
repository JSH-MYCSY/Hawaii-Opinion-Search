APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0102)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal in CAAP-13-0001619,
 
it appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the
 intermediate court of appeals from "
final judgments, orders, or
 
decrees[.]" (Emphasis added). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 (1993 &
 Supp. 2008) "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the
 rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that
 "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document."

HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 
120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The Order Granting Defendant Burton A. Bray’s Motion to
 
Dismiss Complaint Filed June 8, 2011 for Failure to File Pretrial
 Statement, Filed April 3, 2013, filed on May 24, 2013 was not
 reduced to a separate judgment, as required by HRCP Rule 58 and
 Jenkins. Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction.

required by Jenkins.
