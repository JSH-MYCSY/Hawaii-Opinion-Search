SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Hossain and Mitra Mostoufi (the
 
Mostoufis) appeal from the February 25, 2013 "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, Order Granting [Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of
 Hawaii (BOH)'s] Motion for Summary Judgment on All Claims and
 Against Defendants (1) Hossain Mostoufi, (2) Mitra Mostoufi,
 (3) Brasher's Sacramento Auto Auction, Inc., and (4) Director of
 Budget and Fiscal Services, City and County of Honolulu; 
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale Filed
 October 1, 2012" and the February 25, 2013 Judgment entered in
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).

On appeal, the Mostoufis argue the Circuit Court (1)
 
erred by granting summary judgment in favor of BOH because there

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were numerous issues of material fact in dispute related to the 
Mostoufis' affirmative defenses and BOH did not meet its evidentiary burden; (2) abused its discretion in denying their motion to reconsider; and (3) abused its discretion in denying their request for a continuance pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f). 
After careful review of the record on appeal, the
 
points raised, the parties' arguments, and the applicable legal
 authority, we resolve the Mostoufis' arguments on appeal as
 follows:
 
As the moving party, BOH had "the initial burden of 
identifying those portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact" and could "discharge [its] burden by demonstrating that, if the case went to trial, there would be no competent evidence to support a judgment for [its] opponent." Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai
'i 46, 59, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1289 (2013) (citation omitted and formatting altered). 
"A foreclosure decree is only appropriate where all 
four material facts have been established: '(1) the existence of the Agreement, (2) the terms of the Agreement, (3) default by [Appellants] under the terms of the Agreement, and (4) the giving of the cancellation notice and recordation of an affidavit to such effect.'" IndyMac Bank v. Miguel, 117 Hawai
'i 506, 520, 184 
P.3d 821, 835 (App. 2008) (quoting Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)). 
BOH established the existence and terms of the
 
agreements when it attached Note 1, Mortgage 1, Note 2 and
 Mortgage 2 to its motion for summary judgment as exhibits B-E,
 respectively. The Mostoufis did not dispute either the existence
 or terms of the mortgage agreements. BOH established default by
 the Mostoufis in an affidavit by BOH records custodian Wendy
 Saito, which stated "[the Mostoufis] stopped making payments and
 has not made any payments on Note No. 1 since his January 3, 2011
 payment and has not made any payment on Note No. 2 since his
 December 15, 2010 payment." BOH also provided evidence of the
 loan history as exhibits J and K to its motion for summary
 judgment. The Mostoufis did not dispute that they were in
 default or provide any evidence showing that their payments were
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
current. Lastly, BOH established through affidavit and exhibits
 
that it sent the Mostoufis notice of default letters on Note 1
 and Note 2 on September 2, 2010 and May 2, 2011, respectively.
 
Generally, 
a plaintiff-movant is not required to disprove
affirmative defenses asserted by the defendant in
order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment.
[A] plaintiff is only obligated to disprove an
affirmative defense on a motion for summary judgment
when "the defense produces material in support of an
affirmative defense." Generally, the defendant has
the burden of proof on all affirmative defenses, which
includes the burden of proving facts which are
essential to the asserted defense.
 
U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai 'i 28, 41, 313 P.3d 
717, 730 (2013)

 
Hossain Mostoufi's (Hossain) declaration asserted that
(1) During discussions regarding a loan modification application,
 
Hossain told BOH employee Ms. Kawana that he was interested in
 maintaining his credit "above everything else" because it was
 important to the running of his business and "if there was the
 slightest chance this would affect [his] credit [he] would rather
 go ahead and pay the payments in full, even if [he] had to borrow
 money in order to do so. That is how important [his] credit is." 
(2) Ms. Kawana said "her boss said it is okay and that the bank
 will not report [Hossain] to the credit companies." (3) Based on
 this assurance, Hossain began making reduced payments as they had
 discussed, but found, when he sought a line of credit for his
 business, his credit score had dropped from over 720 to 500. (4)
 When he reported this to Ms. Kawana, she acknowledged this
 mistake, which was corrected as reflected in a March 2010 letter. 
(5) While BOH continued to process his loan modification
 application, Ms. Kawana told Hossain to continue making the
 reduced payments and again assured him BOH would not negatively
 report these reduced payments. (6) BOH again reported his loan
 payment as late and his credit continued to suffer. (7)
 Thereafter, BOH informed Hossain that his application had been
 denied because he lacked sufficient income, he would need to pay
 $20,000 to bring his payment up to date, and that the "previous
 arrangement" would end and BOH would "begin to report to credit
 companies." (8) Hossain signed a second agreement to make

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reduced loan payments in order to keep his home. (9) BOH
 
"ruined" his credit, affecting his ability to borrow and to
 effectively run his business.
 
The Mostoufis argued, in opposition to BOH's motion for 
summary judgment, that BOH did not act in good faith during the course of processing his modification application and should be estopped from seeking the remedy of foreclosure. See Joy A. 
McElroy, M.D., Inc. v. Maryl Group, Inc., 107 Hawai
'i 423, 436Â­
37, 114 P.3d 929, 942-43 (App. 2005) (good faith claim) and Stanford Carr Development Corp. v. Unity House, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 
286, 300-01, 303-05, 141 P.3d 459, 473-74, 476-78 (2006). The Mostoufis' allegations created a genuine issue of material fact as to this defense. Thus, it was error to grant summary judgment in BOH's favor. 
In light of our resolution of this first issue, it is
 
unnecessary to address the other issues raised by the Mostoufis. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 25,
 
2013 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting
 Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on All Claims and Against
 Defendants (1) Hossain Mostoufi, (2) Mitra Mostoufi,
 (3) Brasher's Sacramento Auto Auction, Inc., and (4) Director of
 Budget and Fiscal Services, City and County of Honolulu; 
Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale Filed
 October 1, 2012" and February 25, 2013 Judgment, entered in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are vacated and the case is
 remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.
