APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC12-1-000925)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR LEAVE
 
TO FILE LATE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
AND

 
DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
OF MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 Upon consideration of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On April 7, 2017, this court issued its Memorandum
 
Opinion in these consolidated appeals;
 
(2) On April 13, 2017, this court issued an order
 
granting Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Elizabeth Fisher's
 (Fisher) request for additional time to file a motion for
 reconsideration from the Memorandum Opinion, allowing Fisher to
 file a motion for reconsideration no later than May 8, 2017;
 
(3) On May 9, 2017, Fisher filed an untimely "Motion
 
for Reconsideration of Memorandum Opinion";
 
(4) On May 9, 2017, Fisher also filed a "Motion for
 
Leave to File Late Motion for Reconsideration";
 
(5) Fisher's request for further extension of time is 
not authorized under Rule 40(a) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) ("A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved.") (emphasis added); and 
(6) In any event, Fisher fails to show good cause for a
 
further extension.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
 (A) Fisher's "Motion for Leave to File Late Motion for
 
Reconsideration" is denied; and
 
(B)
 Fisher's "Motion for Reconsideration of Memorandum
 
Opinion" is denied as untimely under HRAP Rule 40. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 10, 2017.
