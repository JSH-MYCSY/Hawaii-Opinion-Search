IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MATTHEW A. STEINGREBE, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
PAULA K. STEINBREBE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 11-1-7050)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this consolidated appeal, Defendant-Appellant Paula
 
K. Steingrebe ("Mother") appeals from the "Decree Granting
 
Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" ("Decree") filed on
 June 6, 2013 in the Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family
 
Court").12 As part of her challenge to the Decree, Mother
 
challenges certain conclusions of law ("COL") in the Findings of
 Fact and Conclusions of Law issued by the Family Court on
 August 30, 2013, ("FOF/COL").

 The Honorable Bode A. Uale presided.

 In the second notice of appeal, Mother states that in addition to
the Decree, she is appealing from the denial of her June 14, 2013 Motion to
Reconsider, Alter or Amend Orders or in the Alternative for Further Hearing or
New Trial, but does not attach the August 15, 2013 order denying that motion
to the notice of appeal. Mother does not raise this as a point of error, nor
does she argue it at all, and thus we deem it waived. Haw. R. App. P.
28(b)(4) and (6).

 In response to Mother's second notice of appeal, the Family Court
issued a Second Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on October 31, 2013
which is identical to the FOF/COL, except for the first two introductory
paragraphs. References to the FOF/COL includes the second set. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Mother appears to challenge a number of the
 
decisions made by the Family Court over the course of the divorce
 
and custody proceedings in this case.4 We address the following
 
points in an order which reflects the order of the Family Court
 proceedings.
 
(1) Mother's previous lawyer prevented her from appealing
 the Order Re: Trial from the trial held on September
 13, 19, 20 and 30, 2011 ("September 2011 trial"), which
 involved Mother's request for an order for protection. 
(2) The Family Court erred in granting Plaintiff-Appellee
 Matthew A. Steingrebe's ("Father") motion in limine to
 strike evidence of spousal abuse from the trial held on
 January 28 and 29, and March 4, 2013 ("January/March
 2013 trial") (COL 2).
 
(3) The Family Court erred in granting temporary physical
 custody of Mother and Father's child ("Son") to Father
 after the first day of the January/March 2013 trial,
 continuing through the end of the second day of the
 trial (COL 5). 
(4) The Family Court should not have accepted the parties'
 Agreement Incident to Divorce (Re: Property Division)
 ("Agreement Incident to Divorce") or incorporated the
 terms of that agreement into the Decree (COL 13).
 
(5) The Family Court abused its discretion in authorizing
 Father to take the Audi vehicle as part of its Order Re
 Trial Setting of January 29, 2013 ("Order to Continue
 Trial") (COL 3).
 
(6) The Family Court abused its discretion in granting
 temporary physical custody of Son to Father pending the
 continuation of trial to March 4, 2013, as part of its
 
4
 Mother's opening brief does not comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b) in nearly any respect. On this basis alone,
Mother's appeal could be dismissed. Haw. R. App. P. 30. However, we have"consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to
have their cases heard on the merits, where possible[.]" Schefke v. Reliable 
Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001) (quoting
Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 p.2d 1107,
1111-12 (1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, we have
observed that "the foregoing policy is most acute where . . . the litigant is
pro se." Middleton v. Wong, Nos. 29164 and 30618, 2012 WL 1688535, at *1
(Haw. Ct. App. May 15, 2012).

Order to Continue Trial (COL 5). 
(7) The Family Court improperly determined in its Order to
 
Continue Trial that Father only owed child support and
 alimony arrears as of December 2012, when he should
 have owed arrears dating back to March 2011 (COL 6). 
(8) The Family Court erred in awarding only $300.00 per
 month in alimony to Mother (COL 11). 
(9) The Family Court erred in awarding Mother only 47% as
 her share of Father's military retirement (COL 13). 
(10) The Family Court abused its discretion in concluding
 
that it was in the best interest of Son that Father be
 awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of Son,
 with reasonable visitation to Mother (COL 10). 
(11) Father is concealing Son from Mother, in violation of
 
previous orders of the Family Court. 
(12) 
The Family Court erred in failing to award attorney's
 
fees to Mother (COL 15). 
Upon careful review of the record and Mother's briefs,
 
and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and
 the issues raised, we affirm the Decree and resolve Mother's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1)
 Mother appears to allege that her initial attorney
 
in these proceedings prevented her from appealing from the Order
 Re: Trial which addressed her Petition for an Order for
 Protection.
5 That attorney withdrew as counsel on December 27,
 
2011. The Order Re: Trial was filed on January 26, 2012, while
 Mother was represented by new counsel. Still, Mother did not
 appeal. Therefore, the withdrawal of her initial attorney did
 not affect Mother's ability to appeal from the January 26, 2012
 Order Re: Trial.
 
(2) Mother contests the Family Court's ruling that
 
excluded from the January/March 2013 trial evidence that was
 adduced regarding Mother's prior Petition for an Order for
 Protection, addressed during the September 2011 trial. Res
 
5
 Mother also appears to assert that her initial attorney did not
present certain evidence during the September 2011 trial. [OB at 3] Inasmuch
 
as Mother did not appeal from the final judgment in that proceeding, those
issues cannot now be addressed on appeal.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
judicata bars relitigation of an issue where: 
1) the issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical
with the one presented in the action in question; 2) there
was a final judgment on the merits; and 3) the party against
whom res judicata is asserted was a party or in privity with
a party to the prior adjudication.
 
Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai 'i 474, 480, 918 P.2d 1130, 1136 (1996) 
(quoting Morneau v. Stark Enters., Ltd., 56 Haw. 420, 424, 539 
P.2d 472, 475 (1975)) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Mother apparently sought some re-adjudication of
 
the issues of abuse decided in the prior September 2011 trial. 
The Family Court had entered a final order on the merits of those
 issues in the January 26, 2012 Order Re: Trial, stating that
 "[u]ntil further order of the [Family] Court, each party shall
 be, and is hereby, enjoined and restrained from threatening,
 abusing, or harassing the other party. Provided however the
 parties may text each other on visitation matters (such as
 'running late' and so forth)." Mother does not propose any
 alternative use for the excluded evidence, and any claims that
 she would have had regarding abuse were barred in the second
 trial by res judicata. Accordingly, any evidence related to such
 claims was not relevant at the January/March 2013 trial, and was
 properly excluded by the Family Court. 
(3) Mother appears to challenge the Family Court's
 
decision to allow Son to stay with Father the evening after the
 first day of trial, from 7:00 p.m. on January 28, 2013, through
 the second day of trial, January 29, 2013. The issue is moot,
 however, because that particular interim custody determination
 expired on January 29, 2013 and was replaced by another interim
 custody determination on January 29, 2013, and then the ultimate
 custody determination in the Decree. See Hamilton ex rel. Lethem
 
v. Lethem, 119 Hawai
'i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008) ("The 
mootness doctrine is said to encompass the circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a suit previously suitable for determination." (quoting Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai
'i 307, 
312, 141 P.3d 480, 485 (2006))). 
(4) In divorce cases, the family court "must enforce
 
all valid and enforceable premarital agreements, marital
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreements, and/or divorce agreements." Epp v. Epp, 80 Hawai 'i 
79, 88, 905 P.2d 54, 63 (App. 1995). In its Decree, the Family 
Court approved and incorporated by reference the parties' Agreement Incident to Divorce. Accordingly, the Agreement Incident to Divorce became part of the Decree. Matsunaga v. 
Matsunaga, 99 Hawai
'i 157, 164, 53 P.3d 296, 303 (App. 2002) 
("'[A] property settlement agreement incorporated into a decree of divorce loses its separate existence and becomes part of the decree.'" (quoting Wallace v. Wallace, 1 Haw. App. 315, 315, 619 P.2d 511, 511 (1980))). 
Mother appears to challenge the validity of the
 
Agreement Incident to Divorce, contending that it was entered
 into under duress, and that no interpreter was present to assist
 her during the settlement process. Based on the record on
 appeal, however, it is not clear if Mother raised this issue at
 
6
trial, and thus the issue is not preserved for appeal.  See Child 
Support Enforcement Agency v. Doe
, 109 Hawai 'i 240, 246, 125 P.3d 
461, 467 (2005) ("An issue which was not raised in the lower court will not be considered on appeal" (quoting Kernan v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 35, 856 P.2d 1207, 1224 (1993)). 
(5) Mother's point of error concerning the Audi
 
automobile relates to a provision in the Agreement Incident to
 Divorce. 
Mother agreed that Father could take possession of the
 
Audi in the agreement, which stated that "[t]he 2007 Audi
 automobile, currently held in the name of [Father] is awarded to
 him as his sole and separate property[.]" As noted, absent
 evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the Agreement
 Incident to Divorce was valid and contains terms agreed upon by
 both the parties. Therefore, to the extent that Mother argues
 that these terms were unfair in the Agreement Incident to
 Divorce, her argument fails. 
The Family Court was also authorized "to augment the
 
settlement agreement by adding reasonable, nonsubstantive
 enforcement provisions." Kumar v. Kumar, No. CAAP-12-0000691,
 
2014 WL 1632111, at *10 (Haw. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2014). In
 
6
 The trial transcripts were not made part of the record on appeal.
 
5
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
ordering that Father be allowed to take possession of the Audi in
 
its Order to Continue Trial, the Family Court was adding a
 "reasonable, nonsubstantive enforcement provision" to what the
 parties had already agreed to in the Agreement Incident to
 Divorce. See id. Therefore, the court did not err in enforcing
 
the provision.
 
(6) Mother claims that the Family Court abused its 
discretion in awarding temporary physical custody of Son to Father during the period of time where trial was continued due to Mother's health. The Order to Continue Trial included an interim custody determination as to who should have custody of Son pending the continuance of trial on March 4, 2013. This determination was valid only through March 4, 2013, and was later superceded by the ultimate custody determination in the Decree. Accordingly, any appeal on this issue is moot. See Lethem, 119 
Hawai
'i at 5, 193 P.3d at 843. 
(7) Mother contends that the Family Court improperly 
set December 2012 as the date from which Father had to pay back child support and alimony arrears to Mother. The Order to Continue Trial stated that "[Father] is in arrears for alimony and child support for the total of [$]1772.00 less [$]457.58 for storage for a total of [$]1314.24 [sic]. This recognizes his payment of $1848.00." The order does not explain why the court might have used December 2012 as the baseline from which to apply offsets. Any further review is hindered by the fact that there is no transcript of the January/March 2013 trial in the record on appeal. Under these circumstances, Mother's point of error cannot be reviewed on appeal. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 
Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("The burden is upon 
appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." (quoting Union Building Materials, Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984)) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
(8) At trial, Mother had requested that the Family
 
Court award her $2,000 per month for at least five years, based
 on her lack of education and assimilation to the United States,
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
her significant debt incurred since the divorce proceedings
 
began, her inability to work or obtain health insurance because
 of her medical condition, and Father's financial resources. On
 appeal, Mother makes similar claims regarding her health and rent
 expenses, debt, and difficulties establishing a career. 
Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, the
appellate court is not authorized to disturb the family
court's decision [regarding alimony] unless (1) the family
court disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to
the substantial detriment of a party litigant; (2) the
family court failed to exercise its equitable discretion; or
(3) the family court's decision clearly exceeds the bounds
of reason.
 
Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai 'i 475, 486, 960 P.2d 145, 156 (App. 1998) 
(original brackets omitted) (quoting Bennett v. Bennett, 8 Haw. 
App. 415, 426, 807 P.2d 597, 603 (1991)). Under the circumstances here, the Family Court heard the evidence during the January/March 2013 trial and awarded Mother less alimony than she requested, but more than Father was willing to voluntarily pay. We cannot conclude on this record, that the Family Court abused its discretion by disregarding certain rules or principles of law, failing to exercise its equitable discretion, or exceeding the bounds of reason in making its alimony determination. See id. 
(9) Mother argues that she should have been awarded a
 
greater percentage of Father's military retirement. In the
 Agreement Incident to Divorce, the parties agreed that she would
 receive the "Linson share" of Father's retirement in accordance
 with the "Military Qualifying Court Order." The Decree states
 that Mother is awarded 40% of Father's military retirement in
 accordance with the "Military Qualifying Court Order." 
Mother does not claim that the Family Court
 
misinterpreted or misstated the percentage she was due under the
 "Military Qualifying Court Order." Moreover, that order was not
 made part of the record on appeal, and it is not clear that this
 court could review that order in any event. Therefore, Mother's
 argument on this issue is not addressed further.
 
(10) In challenging the Family Court's ultimate
 
custody determination, Mother appears to contend that the court
 improperly weighed the evidence regarding, among other things,
 
7
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the testimony and report of the custody evaluator and custody
 
investigator. She challenges the credibility of various
 witnesses and attempts to introduce her own evidence in her
 opening brief. 
Mother has not sustained her burden on appeal to show 
that the Family Court's determination as to what was in the best interest of Son was not supported by the record or clearly erroneous. Her challenges to the credibility of witnesses at trial cannot be heard on appeal. In re Doe, 95 Hawai
'i 183, 190, 
20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) ("'It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact.'" (brackets and ellipsis omitted) (quoting State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai
'i 87, 101, 997 P.2d 13, 27 (2000))). 
Moreover, Mother cannot introduce new, unsubstantiated evidence for the first time on appeal. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 641-2 (2004) 
("The appellate court . . . need not consider a point that was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner."). Therefore, her challenge to the Family Court's decision that awarding Father sole legal and primary physical custody was in the best interest of Son is without merit. 
(11) The Decree stated that in the event that Mother
 
does not reside in the same locale as Son, Mother may have
 "[u]nlimited and liberal correspondence and . . . daily
 telephone, skype and/or email contacts at reasonable hours[,]" as
 well as visitation during Christmas, Spring and Summer vacations. 
Mother argues that Father is "concealing" Son from her by not
 allowing her telephone correspondence. Thus, she apparently
 seeks to enforce the terms of the Decree regarding
 correspondence. The proper method by which to enforce the terms
 of the Decree, however, is for Mother to apply to the clerk of
 the Family Court for enforcement of the Decree. See Haw. Fam.
 
Ct. R. 70 (2000).
 
(12) Mother does not refer us to any statute or rule
 
under which the Family Court could have awarded her attorneys'
 fees. Accordingly, her argument is without merit. 
Therefore,
