SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
This appeal arises out of a post-divorce-decree
 
proceeding in which Defendant-Appellant Wayne Arthur Whistler,
 
pro se, appeals from the June 3, 2013 "Order Denying Defendant's
 Motion for Postponement of the Court's Ruling on Attorney Fees
 for the Plaintiff in the Court Hearing of April 24, 2013" ("Order
 Denying Motion for Postponement"), and the June 3, 2013 "Order
 Awarding Attorney's Fees and Costs; Judgment" ("Order Awarding
 Attorneys Fees and Costs") (collectively, the "June 3, 2013
 Orders") entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit
 
1/
("Family Court")  in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Anne Caprio
Shovic. 
On appeal, Whistler alleges that the Family Court

 
abused its discretion when it awarded attorneys' fees and costs

to Shovic.2/ Upon careful review of the record and Whistler's
 
brief, and having given due consideration to the arguments
 
advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Whistler's points of
 error as follows and affirm.
 
We review the Family Court's award for abuse of
 
discretion. Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117
 
Hawai
'i 92, 105, 176 P.3d 91, 104 (2008) (quoting Kahala Royal 
Corp. v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 113 Hawai 'i 251, 266, 
151 P.3d 732, 747 (2007)). We are bound by the Family Court's
 uncontested findings of fact, and any conclusions of law which
 follow from them and are correct statements of law are valid.

 App. 455, 459, 667 P.2d 844, 848 (1983)).
 
Whistler asserts that the Family Court abused its
 
discretion because: 1) Shovic should have waited for the Family
 Court to issue its December 4, 2013 Order before she filed her
 
2/
 Whistler's original points of error state as follows:
 
(1) 	"Ms. Shovic should have waited for the Family Court's
appeal ruling of 4 December 2013 before she filed her
motion. If she had waited, the Family Court's
decision would have negated her reason for filing.
The legal fees incurred by her were a result of the
OCSH's erroneous ruling that Mr. Whistler should
continue to pay the now invalidated $777 a month."
 
(2) 	"Judge Remigio should have waited to rule on Ms.
Shovic's motion until the critical evidence, the
appeal to the Family Court, became available. To not
 wait is like a judge ruling against a defendant after
the prosecution has presented its case but before the
defense has had a chance to do so. Mr. Whistler was
 vindicated by the Family Court's 4 December 2013
ruling. If the OCSH had done its job correctly, Mr.
Whistler would have been able to catch up and keep up
with child support payments."
 
(3) 	"A judge should not make a Defendant pay for a
Plaintiff's lawyer when the Defendant is unable to pay
a lawyer for himself. It is common knowledge that
being unable to afford an attorney puts a Pro Se
Defendant at a great, although not always
insurmountable, disadvantage when up against a
Plaintiff with experienced representation. Ms Shovic,
with over a half million dollars in her bank account,
chose to pay the expensive legal fees in order to
ensure her win in the child support hearings. Mr.
 Whistler, whose liquid assets are nearly zero, was
unable to do so because he could not afford an
 attorney."

motion;3/ 2) it should not have ruled on Shovic's February 14,
 
2013 Amended Motion for Judgment and Order for Execution of Real
 
and Personal Property with Memorandum ("Amended Motion") until
 after the issuance of the December 4, 2013 Order; and 3) it
 should not make Whistler pay for Shovic's attorney when he was
 unable to pay for an attorney to represent himself. We conclude
 that Whistler has failed to establish that the Family Court
 abused its discretion.
4/
 
The Family Court has discretion to award attorneys'
 
fees and costs to the prevailing party. "Whenever a party files
 a motion seeking to enforce a child support order, the court may
 award the prevailing party the party's costs and reasonable
 attorneys' fees incurred, except as this chapter otherwise
 provides. The award shall be made only when the prevailing party
 was represented by an attorney." Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 571-52.7
 (2006). 
Here, Shovic filed her Amended Motion, seeking to
 
enforce the OCSH's then-current child support order. Shovic was
 represented by an attorney. Prior to the April 24, 2013 hearing,
 but after Shovic filed her Amended Motion, Whistler paid the
 child support arrearages in full. The Family Court held the
 hearing to address the issue of Shovic's request for attorneys'
 fees and costs, and ordered that judgment be entered against
 Whistler, and that Shovic be awarded attorneys' fees and costs. 
Based on the record presented, we are unable to determine that

 On September 14, 2011, Whistler requested that the Hawai' i Child 
Support Enforcement Agency modify his child support obligation which the
Family Court had set in its order dated November 3, 2010 at $777 per month.Following a hearing on March 23, 2012, the Office of Child Support Hearings("OCSH") issued its Administrative Findings and Order ("OCSH Order") thatdeclined to modify the child support obligation. Whistler appealed the OCSHOrder to the Family Court and it appears, from Exhibit E attached toWhistler's opening brief, that the Family Court (Hon. R. Mark Browning,presiding) issued its ruling on December 4, 2013, vacating in part the OCSHOrder.

 Whistler did not provide transcripts of the April 24, 2013 hearing
as required by Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule. Haw. R. App. P.
10(b). "The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by referenceto matters in the record and he or she has the responsibility of providing an
adequate transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909
P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).Nevertheless, we address the merits of the claims to the extent possible. See 
Thomas-Yukimura v. Yukimura, 130 Hawai' i 1, 10 n.19, 304 P.3d 1182, 1191 n.19
(2013).

the Family Court abused its discretion when it awarded attorneys'
 
fees and costs to Shovic.
 
Whistler argues that "Ms. Shovic should have waited for
 
the Family Court's appeal ruling of 4 December 2013 before she
 filed her motion." He asserts that "[i]f she had waited, the
 Family Court's decision would have negated her reason for filing. 
The legal fees incurred by her were a result of the OCSH's
 erroneous ruling that Mr. Whistler should continue to pay the now
 invalidated $777 a month." 
While Whistler's argument appears to be supported, at 
least in part, by what Whistler claims to be a Family Court order dated December 4, 2013, vacating in part the OCSH Order, that evidence is neither properly before us on appeal nor is it complete.
5/ In any event, Hawai 'i law provides that 
administrative orders remain in effect until they are superseded by a subsequent court or administrative order. Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 576E-12 (2006). Furthermore, proceedings for review do not stay enforcement of an agency decision or the confirmation of any fine as a judgment. Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 91-14(c) (2012). Therefore, at the time that Shovic filed her motion, she was entitled to child support arrearages, and the Family Court did not err in failing to await resolution of Whistler's challenge to the OCHS's Order before issuing the June 3, 2013 Orders. 
Here, Whistler failed to pay child support as required
 
by the order then in effect. Had Whistler paid child support
 until such time that the order was modified, Shovic would not
 have had cause to file her motion to enforce. The remainder of
 Whistler's arguments are without merit. Thus, the Family Court
 did not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorneys' fees and
 costs to Shovic.
 
5/
 Whistler attached two pages of what he contends is a part of an
order addressing Whistler's appeal of the OCSH Order as Exhibit E to his
opening brief. The order itself, however, is not found in the record onappeal and thus is not available to us. "Anything that is not part of therecord shall not be appended to the brief, except as provided in this Rule."Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(10). This court disregards appendices that are not part
of the record, unless otherwise specified by HRAP. See Au Hoy v. Au Hoy, No.
30486, 2013 WL 2650568, at *1 n.2 (Hawai' i App. June 12, 2013) ("Insofar as
any appendices are not part of the record, they are disregarded.").
