Gerald Villanueva (Appellant), pro se, which the court construes
as a motion for relief from default of the record on appeal, the
papers in support, and the record, it appears that (1) Appellant
filed a notice of appeal on July 10, 2013; (2) on August 14,
 2013, the court denied Appellant’s motion for leave to proceed onappeal in forma pauperis because Appellant failed to identify theissues to be raised on appeal as required by the appellate rules;

provides that where a motion to proceed in forma pauperis is 
denied the movant shall, within ten days after the motion is denied, pay all unpaid filing fees and give security for costs, and failure to do so may result in dismissal of the appeal; and (4) Appellant has not remedied the deficiency in his prior
 motion, paid the appellate filing fees, or given security for
 costs.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
