APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants John Hasircoglu (Hasircoglu) and
 
Maria Hasircoglu (together, the Hasircoglus) appeal the "Order
 
Granting Defendant FOPCO, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
Filed on May 7, 2013" entered on June 17, 2013 in the Circuit
 
1
Court of the Second Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, the Hasircoglus contend the circuit court

 
erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee
 FOPCO, Inc. (FOPCO).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Around August 27, 2008, the State of Hawai
'i, 
Agricultural Resource Management Division of the Department of Agriculture (State) entered into a contract (Prime Contract) with 
FOPCO for a construction project on Moloka
'i (Moloka 'i Project). 
1 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In a letter to FOPCO enclosing the Prime Contract, the State
 
asked FOPCO to submit the name of a superintendent or qualified
 representative on the job site. In an undated document titled
 "Project Superintendent and Key Personnel," FOPCO listed its
 president, Dennis C. McElrath (McElrath), as the "Project
 
Manager"; project manager at T&M Construction Services, Inc.
 
(T&M), Donald Clark (Clark), as the "Project Superintendent"; and
 
owner and president of T&M, Michael Estes (Estes), as the "Health
 
and Safety Manager."
 
In October 2008, FOPCO executed a "Subcontract 
Agreement" (Subcontract) with T&M for the provision of electrical 
services for the Moloka
'i Project. 
Hasircoglu began working for T&M around January 1,
 
2009. Hasircoglu alleged that on February 26, 2009, he was
 
injured when a large spool holding wire and weighing
 approximately 2,500 pounds hit him while he was riding next to
 the spool on a trailer pulled by another vehicle. According to
 Hasircoglu, Clark had instructed Hasircoglu to sit on the trailer
 in front of the spool holder.
 
On February 22, 2011, the Hasircoglus filed a complaint
 
in the circuit court alleging, among other claims, a claim for
 negligence against FOPCO. On May 7, 2013, FOPCO filed a motion
 for summary judgment (MSJ). At a hearing on June 4, 2013, the
 
circuit court granted FOPCO's MSJ. The circuit court entered its
 
order granting FOPCO's MSJ on June 17, 2013.
 
The Hasircoglus filed a premature notice of appeal on
 
July 17, 2013.
2 The circuit court entered its judgment in favor
 
of FOPCO on September 9, 2013.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
An appellate court reviews an award of summary
judgment de novo  under the same standard applied by the
circuit court. Fujimoto v. Au
, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136, 19 P.3d
699, 719 (2001) (citing Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber
Inv. Co.,  74 Haw. 85, 104, 839 P.2d 10, 22 . . . (1992)).
This court articulated the standard as follows: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,

depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
 
2
 Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(2) permits the filing
of a notice of appeal after the announcement of a decision but before entry ofthe judgment or order.

admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.
 
Id. (citations omitted). We must review the evidence in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motionfor summary judgment. Id. at 137, 19 P.3d at 720 (citing
State ex rel. Bronster v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai' i 179, 186, 932
P.2d 316, 323 (1997) and Maguire v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 79Hawai'i 110, 112, 899 P.2d 393, 395 (1995)). 
Thomas v. Kidani, 126 Hawai 'i 125, 127-28, 267 P.3d 1230, 1232-33 
(2011). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
This appeal concerns whether FOPCO owed a duty of care
 
to Hasircoglu, an employee of T&M. The Hasircoglus contend that
 
Estes and Clark were agents of FOPCO, that they were responsible
 for safely securing a spool of wire that Hasircoglu asserts hit
 him in the head and back, and that there are genuine issues of
 material fact as to whether Estes or Clark negligently caused
 Hasircoglu's injuries and whether FOPCO was vicariously liable
 for Estes' or Clark's negligence. In response, FOPCO argues that
 the circuit court properly granted summary judgment because FOPCO
 demonstrated that there was no evidence showing that either Estes
 or Clark were employees or agents of FOPCO.
 
In support of their position that Estes and Clark acted
 
as agents of FOPCO, the Hasircoglus cite a document listing Estes
 as the "Health and Safety Manager" and Clark as the "Project
 Superintendent."
3 The Hasircoglus give no context to this
 
document or explain how those positions create an agency
 relationship between Estes and FOPCO, and Clark and FOPCO. See
 
Cho Mark Oriental Food, Ltd. v. K & K Int'l, 73 Haw. 509, 515,
 836 P.2d 1057, 1061 (1992) ("An agency relationship may be
 created through actual or apparent authority."). On the
 contrary, FOPCO presented evidence, including the deposition
 testimony of Clark and Estes, that Clark and Estes were employees
 
3
 The Hasircoglus also argue that the Subcontract contained an invalid
delegation of FOPCO's duty to ensure a safe workplace to T&M in violation of
the Prime Contract. However, the Hasircoglus do not explain how such an
alleged breach of contract could support a claim that FOPCO violated a duty of
care owed to Hasircoglu. Therefore, this argument does not advance their
contention that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment.

of T&M and were not subject to direction by FOPCO or any employee
 
of FOPCO.
 
The document cited by the Hasircoglus is insufficient,
 
particularly in light of the evidence that T&M was an independent
 contractor and that T&M, Estes, and Clark were not subject to
 direction by FOPCO, to raise a genuine issue of material fact as
 
to whether Estes or Clark was in an agency relationship with
 
FOPCP or whether FOPCO could be held vicariously liable for
 Estes' or Clark's negligence. The circuit court did not err in
 granting summary judgment for FOPCO.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Order Granting Defendant FOPCO, Inc.'s
 
Motion for Summary Judgment Filed on May 7, 2013" entered on June
 17, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
