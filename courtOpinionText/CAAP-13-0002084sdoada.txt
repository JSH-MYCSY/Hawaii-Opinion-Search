IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
LOTTIE TAGUPA, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
VIPDESK, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 3FC12-1-297H)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Lottie Tagupa (Tagupa) appeals from
 
the (1) June 17, 2013 Judgment; and (2) June 17, 2013 Order
 
Granting Defendant's Motion for Award of Attorney's Fees and
 Costs (Order Awarding Attorney's Fees) both entered in District
 
1
Court of the Third Circuit Court  (district court).
 
On appeal, Tagupa contends the district court erred by
 
granting2 Defendant-Appellee VIPDesk's June 5, 2013 Motion for
 
Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 607-14.5 (Supp. 2013) and Hawai
'i District Court 
Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 41.3

 VIPDesk correctly notes that Tagupa "incorrectly identifies" error
with the district court's Order Awarding Attorney's Fees pursuant to DCRCP
Rule 41(a)(2) and HRS § 607-14.5 because attorney's fees and costs had already
been awarded to VIPDesk. The district court's June 4, 2013 "Order Granting
[Tagupa's] Motion to Dismiss This Case Without Prejudice" specified VIPDesk
would "be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in defending
this case in this Court."

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Tagupa's
 appeal lacks merit. 
The district court was authorized to condition
 
dismissal of Tagupa's complaint "upon such terms and conditions
 as the court deems proper." DCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). DCRCP Rule 41
 provides in part:
 
Rule 41. DISMISSAL OF ACTIONS
 
(a) Voluntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof.
 
. . . .
 
(2) BY ORDER OF COURT. Except as provided in paragraph
(1) of this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be
dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the
court and 
upon such terms and conditions as the court deems
proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant
prior to the service upon that defendant of the plaintiff's
motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against
the defendant's objection unless the counterclaim can remain
pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless
 otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this
paragraph is without prejudice.
 
(Emphasis added.) We note Tagupa presents no argument against
 
the district court's award of attorney's fees and costs pursuant
 to DCRCP Rule 41(a)(2).
 
"In imposing conditions [under Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 41(a)(2)], 'the court should endeavor to 
insure that substantial justice is accorded to both parties.'"4

(quoting 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure 
§ 2364 (2d ed. 1994) at 278). We review a court's imposition of such terms and conditions for an abuse of discretion. Moniz, 79

 HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) contains text identical to that of DCRCP Rule
41(a)(2). Case law interpreting HRCP Rule 41 thus informs our application of
DCRCP Rule 41 to the facts of this case.

Rule 41(a)(2), "will consider the expense and inconvenience to 
the defendant and will deny the motion if the defendant will be prejudiced seriously by a dismissal. The court will examine the possibility that any harm to the defendant may be avoided by imposing terms and conditions on the dismissal." Moniz, 79 
Hawai
'i at 500-01, 904 P.2d at 514-15 (quoting 9 C. Wright & A. 
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2364 at 293-96. "To alleviate the prejudice resulting from dismissal [pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 41], courts typically impose costs and attorney fees upon plaintiff." Mayes v. 
Fujimoto, 181 F.R.D. 453, 456 (D. Hawai
'i 1998) aff'd, 173 F.3d 
861 (9th Cir. 1999). 
At the May 23, 2013 hearing on Tagupa's motion to
 
dismiss, counsel for Tagupa requested that no attorney's fees and
 costs be awarded to VIPDesk in light of Tagupa's pro se status at
 the time of filing the complaint and because of counsel's prompt
 efforts to dismiss the case and refile in federal court. The
 district court expressed concern that VIPDesk had already
 incurred expenses and "should not have to bear the expense
 because [Tagupa] filed the claim in the wrong court."
 
VIPDesk opposed Tagupa's motion to dismiss on the basis 
that it suffered "prejudice" because it had "diligently defended itself in this [proceeding before the district court]" and [was] prepared to proceed to trial." The district court acted within its discretion by "consider[ing] the expense and inconvenience . . . [,]" (Moniz, 79 Hawai
'i at 500-01, 904 P.2d at 514-15) and 
"alleviat[ing] the prejudice resulting from dismissal" by awarding VIPDesk attorney's fees and costs. Mayes, 181 F.R.D. at 
456. 
Because we conclude that the district court did not
 
abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees and costs under
 DCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), we need not reach Tagupa's contention that
 the district court erred by awarding VIPDesk attorney's fees and
 costs under HRS § 607-14.5. Any alleged error in the district

No error in either the admission or the exclusion of
 
evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in
anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the
parties is ground for granting a new trial or for vacating,
modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order,
unless refusal to take such action appears to the court
inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every
stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect
in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial
rights of the parties.

court's application of HRS § 607-14.5 would be harmless.5 See

Sullivan, 87 Hawai 'i 217, 241-42, 953 P.2d 1315, 1339-40 (1998). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the (1) June 17, 2013
 
Judgment; and (2) June 17, 2013 Order Granting Defendant's Motion
 for Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs both entered in District
