On appeal, Monroe argues that the district court erred
 
in denying his motion to dismiss the Complaint on the ground that
 
it was pled in the disjunctive and, therefore, defective. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Monroe's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
The district court did not err in denying the motion to
 
dismiss the Complaint. Monroe highlights six instances in which
 "or" is used in the Complaint.
3 Each of these instances involves
 
either states of mind; synonymous phrases; statutorily defined
 terms; or similar conduct codified under a single subsection of a
 statute. These uses of the disjunctive were permissible. See
 State v. Codiamat, 131 Hawai
'i 220, 227, 317 P.3d 664, 671 
(2013); State v. Sherman, No. CAAP-12-0000887, 2015 WL 3476381 at
 *1 (App. May 29, 2015) (SDO).

[or]

(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]
3 The Complaint stated that:
 
On or about the 8th day of January, 2013, in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [Monroe] did
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate or assume
 actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway while under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental
faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against
casualty; and/or did operate or assume actual physical
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or
 highway with .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred

violation of Section 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) of the
