First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
Petitioners contend the circuit court erred by: 
(1) finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to
 
hear quo warranto actions challenging an individual's possession
 of title to office of representative when allegations have been
 
averred that the individual is no longer a qualified voter of the
 
representative district pursuant to article III, section 6 of the
Hawai
'i Constitution (rev. 1978);2
 and  
(2) finding a quo warranto action challenging an
 
individual's possession of title to elected office when
 
allegations have been averred that the individual is no longer a
 
qualified voter of the representative district pursuant to
 
article III, section 6 of the Hawai 'i Constitution, was a voter 
registration challenge pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)

Section 6 . No person shall be eligible to serve as a member
of the senate unless the person has been a resident of the
State for not less than three years, has attained the age of
majority and is, prior to filing nomination papers and
thereafter continues to be, a qualified voter of the
senatorial district from which the person seeks to be
elected; except that in the year of the first general
election following reapportionment, but prior to the primary
election, an incumbent senator may move to a new district
without being disqualified from completing the remainder of
the incumbent senator's term. No person shall be eligible to
serve as a member of the house of representatives unless the
person has been a resident of the State for not less than
three years, has attained the age of majority and is, prior
to filing nomination papers and thereafter continues to be,
a qualified voter of the representative district from which
the person seeks to be elected; except that in the year of

I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 31, 2012, Petitioners filed their Petition
 
for Writ of Quo Warranto (
Petition) with the circuit court
 
pursuant to HRS § 659-4 (1993).4 Petitioners alleged Respondent-
Appellee Calvin K.Y. Say (Say), a member of the House of
 
Representatives from the Twentieth Representative District, "has
 
lived and continues to live at 2247 Star Road in Pauoa Valley in
 
the Twenty Fifth Representative District and the house at 2247
 
3(...continued)
in an election of members of the board of trustees of the
 
office of Hawaiian affairs the voter making the challenge
must be registered to vote in that election. The challenge
shall be in writing, setting forth the grounds upon which it
is based, and be signed by the person making the challenge.
The challenge shall be delivered to the clerk who shall
forthwith serve notice thereof on the person challenged. The
clerk shall, as soon as possible, investigate and rule on
the challenge.
 
(b) Challenging on election day. Any voter rightfully in the
polling place may challenge the right to vote of any person who
comes to the precinct officials for voting purposes. The challenge
shall be on the grounds that the voter is not the person the voter
alleges to be, or that the voter is not entitled to vote in that
precinct; provided that only in an election of members of the
board of trustees of the office of Hawaiian affairs, a person
registered to vote in that election may also challenge on the
grounds that the voter is not Hawaiian. No other or further
challenge shall be allowed. Any person thus challenged shall first
be given the opportunity to make the relevant correction pursuant
to section 11-21. The challenge shall be considered and decided
immediately by the precinct officials and the ruling shall be
announced.
 
(c) If neither the challenger nor the challenged voter
shall appeal the ruling of the clerk or the precinct
officials, then the voter shall either be allowed to vote or
be prevented from voting in accordance with the ruling. If
an appeal is taken to the board of registration, the
challenged voter shall be allowed to vote; provided that
ballot is placed in a sealed envelope to be later counted or
rejected in accordance with the ruling on appeal. The chief
election officer shall adopt rules in accordance with
chapter 91 to safeguard the secrecy of the challenged
voter's ballot.

 "A petition for a writ of quo warranto seeks a court order directing
a person who claims or usurps a state office to show by what authority he or
she claims the office. The burden [of proof] rests with the respondent once
the writ is issued."  74 Haw. 394, 399, 846 P.2d 894,
897 (1993) (citation and emphasis omitted). Private individuals obtain a writ
 of quo warranto by filing a sworn petition with a circuit court "setting out
facts sufficient to show a right to the order[.]" 
HRS § 659-4. The
 
Respondent must file her or his answer in writing, within a time determined by
the circuit court, and stating the authority under which the person claims to
act. HRS § 659-5 (1993).

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Star Road is where his habitation is fixed;" and that "[Say] is
 
registered to vote and claims legal residency at 1822 10th Avenue
 
in Palolo Valley [(Palolo residence)] but previously admitted he
 
does not actually live there . . . ." Petitioners sought a writ
 
of quo warranto requiring Say "to appear before this Honorable
 
[circuit c]ourt at a time certain and as soon as possible and
 
answer unto petitioners and show by what warrant and authority he
 
claims title."
 
In 2006, Say prevailed in two challenges to his voter
 
registration, partly on the basis of his contention that his
 
absence from his Palolo residence was "due to extraordinary
 
circumstances relating to the provision of health and living
 
assistance for a member of his family." Another unsuccessful
 
challenge to Say's voter registration occurred in 2010.
 
On January 8, 2013, Say filed his Motion to Dismiss
 
Petition for Writ of Quo Warranto (Say's Motion to Dismiss). On
 
February 12, 2013, Petitioners filed a Memorandum in Opposition
 
to Say's Motion to Dismiss. On February 15, 2013, Say filed a
 
reply to the Memorandum in Opposition.
 
The circuit court held a hearing on Say's Motion to 
Dismiss on February 20, 2013. Petitioners argued that the 
question of an officer-holder's residency should be submitted to 
an evidentiary trial as occurred in Dejetley v. Kaho 'ohalahala, 
122 Hawai 'i 251, 226 P.3d 421 (2010). The circuit court ruled at 
the hearing: "It is [the circuit court's] determination as a 
question of law that this [(the petition's challenge to Say's 
voter registration)] is exclusively within the province of the 
city clerk, and HRS Section 11-25 would govern these types of 
questions and this type of issue, not the jurisdiction of [the 
circuit court.]" 
On March 11, 2013, the circuit court entered its Order 
Granting Motion to Dismiss Petition pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(1), which states: 
1. The [Petition] is, on its face, a challenge to
[Say's] voter registration. Challenges to voter
registration are exclusively within the province of the
clerks of the respective counties pursuant to [HRS] §11-25. 
4
   
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2. The circuit courts can never have jurisdiction
over challenges to voter registration. A person ruled
against by the county clerk may appeal to the board of
registration pursuant to [HRS] §11-26 [2009 Repl.], and an
appeal from a board of registration decision must be made to
the intermediate appellate court pursuant to [HRS] §11-51
[2009 Repl.].
 
3. [Say's Motion to Dismiss] is GRANTED pursuant to
[HRCP Rule] 12(b)(1). The dismissal shall be without
 prejudice as to Petitioners' ability to bring a challenge in
the proper forum, which the [circuit court] finds is the
Office of the City Clerk, City and County of Honolulu.
 
4. [Say's] request for attorneys' fees is DENIED
without prejudice as to [Say's] ability to seek such fees in
the proper forum.
 
On March 21, 2013, Petitioners filed a notice of appeal
 
to this court, which was dismissed on July 2, 2013 for lack of
 
appellate jurisdiction because the circuit court's order had not
 
been reduced to a separate final judgment. 
On July 5, 2013, the circuit court filed its Final
 
Judgment in favor of Say. Petitioners then filed a notice of
 
appeal on July 23, 2013.
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
Petitioners sought a writ of quo warranto "requir[ing]
 
that [Say] come forward with his burden and show by what
 authority he holds title to office." The circuit court found
 
however, that it lacked jurisdiction because the Petition was "on
 
its face, a challenge to [Say's] voter registration." 
Petitioners contend the circuit court erred.
 
A circuit court's grant or denial of a motion to
 
dismiss under HRCP Rule 12(b)(1) for "lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction is a question of law, reviewable de novo." Norris
 
v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 74 Haw. 235, 239, 842 P.2d 634, 637 (1992), aff'd, Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246 
(1994). In Norris, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court adopted the view of 
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Love v. United States, 871 F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1989), opinion amended on other grounds 
and superseded by Love v. United States, 915 F.2d 1242 (9th Cir. 
1989): 
review of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction is based on the contents of the complaint, the
allegations of which we accept as true and construe in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff. Dismissal is
 
5
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
improper unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff
can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which
would entitle him to relief. 
Norris, 74 Haw. at 240, 842 P.2d at 637 (internal quotation
 
marks, citation, and brackets omitted.) 
The Petition addressed Say's eligibility to serve as a
 
member of the House of Representatives under article III, section
 
6 of the Hawai 'i Constitution. Article III, section 6 of the 
Hawai'i Constitution provides, in part, eligibility requirements 
for those seeking to serve as house representatives:
Section 6 . . . No person shall be eligible to serve as a
member of the house of representatives unless the
person . . . is, prior to filing nomination papers and
thereafter continues to be, a qualified voter of the
representative district from which the person seeks to be
elected; except that in the year of the first general
election following reapportionment, but prior to the primary
election, an incumbent representative may move to a new
district without being disqualified from completing the
remainder of the incumbent representative's term.
 
Our courts have jurisdiction over the interpretation of 
constitutional provisions for the qualification of candidates for 
the house of representatives and of elected representatives to 
serve in that capacity. See Alakai Na Keiki, Inc. v. Matayoshi, 
127 Hawai 'i 263, 276, 277 P.3d 988, 1001 (2012), reconsideration 
denied, 127 Hawai 'i 233, 277 P.3d 327 (2012) ("Our ultimate 
authority is the Constitution; and the courts, not the legislature, are the ultimate interpreters of the Constitution.") 
quoting State v. Nakata,  76 Hawai
'i 360, 370, 878 P.2d 699, 709 
(1994); and Cnty. of Hawai 'i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai 'i 
391, 454, 235 P.3d 1103, 1166 (2010) ("The ultimate authority for 
interpreting Hawai 'i's constitutional guarantees is vested in the 
courts of this state."); Akizaki v. Fong, 51 Haw. 354, 357, 461 P.2d 221, 223 (1969) ("[C]ourts are required by the [Hawai
'i] 
Constitution to be the forum and the final arbiter in such disputes [over election contests involving a legislative 
seat]."). 
Article III, section 1 of the Hawai
'i Constitution 
vests the legislature with "the power to enact laws and to 
declare what the law shall be." Sherman v. Sawyer, 63 Haw. 55, 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
57, 621 P.2d 346, 348 (1980). "Under this grant of authority, 
the legislature has the power to establish the subject matter 
jurisdiction of our state court system." Id. Jurisdiction 
established by legislative enactment, however, may not encroach on judicial power vested in the courts by the constitution. See 
AlohaCare v. Dep't of Human Servs., 127 Hawai
'i 76, 88, 276 P.3d 
645, 657 (2012), as corrected (May 18, 2012), reconsideration 
denied, 127 Hawai 'i 233, 277 P.3d 327 (2012). 
Petitioners did not "challenge" Say's voter 
registration under HRS chapter 11, but rather his qualification 
to remain seated as a house representative under the Hawai 'i 
Constitution. A person is a "voter" if she or he is "duly registered to vote." See HRS § 11-1 (2009 Repl.). "No person 
shall register or vote in any other precinct than that in which the person resides except as provided in [HRS] section 11-21." 
HRS § 11-12(a) (2009 Repl.). "An applicant shall not be 
registered to vote unless the applicant's voter registration form 
contains all of the information listed in [Hawaii Administrative 
Rules (HAR)] section 3-172-20(a)." HAR § 3-172-24(a) (am. 
2010).
5 "Prior to election day, any registered voter may

§3-172-20 Voter registration form. (a) The affidavit on 
the application for voter registration form shall be in a form
prescribed and approved by the chief election officer containing
substantially the following information:
 
(1)	 A place for the applicant's name, social
security number, date of birth, residence
address or a description of the location
of the residence, and mailing address;
 
(2)	 A statement that the residence
 stated in the voter
 registration form is not
simply because of the
applicant's presence in
Hawaii, but that the residence
was acquired with the intent
to make Hawaii the applicant's
legal residence with all the
accompanying obligations
therein;
 
(3)	 A statement that the applicant is a U.S.
citizen;
 
(continued...)
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
challenge the right of a person to be or to remain registered as
 
a voter in any precinct." HAR § 3-172-40(a). Challenges to a
 
voter's registration prior to an election are investigated and
 
ruled upon by the clerk of the county in which an election is
 
held. HRS § 11-25(a). A Board of Registration (County Board) in
 
each of the four counties hears appeals from the county clerk's
 
ruling. See HRS § 11-41 (2009 Repl.).
 
The legislative history of HRS chapter 11 shows that
 
the legislature did not intend to vest powers in the county clerk
 
and County Boards that would conflict with constitutional
 
provisions governing the eligibility of persons to serve as
 
members of the legislature. HRS chapter 11 was enacted in 1970
 
as part of Act 26. 1970 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 26, § 2 at 17-71. 
"Due to the initiation of new voting systems, new parties, a
 
rapidly increasing and mobile population, and actions of the 1968
 
Constitutional Convention," the legislature passed Act 26 to
 
"thorough[ly] revis[e]" State and county election laws. 1970
 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 26, § 1 at 17. The committee report stated
 
that provisions included in Act 26 were intended to clarify
 
residency, make voter registration "easier," and "assist[]" the
 
county clerk in "keeping registration up to date." H. Stand.

(4)	 A statement that the applicant
is at least sixteen years of
age at the time of completing
the registration form;
 
(5)	 A self-subscribing oath that the applicant
is swearing or affirming to the truth of
the information given in the affidavit;
 
(6)	 A space for the signature of a
witness when the applicant is
unable to write for reason of
 illiteracy, blindness, or
other physical disability; and
 
(7)	 A statement which says that
the office, site, or location
at which an applicant
registers to vote, or the
declination on the part of the
applicant to register to vote
will remain confidential and
 will be used for voter
 registration purposes only.

Comm. Rep. No. 589, in 1969 House Journal at 852. Specifically, 
added provisions would allow the county clerk "to gather 
information on the residency status of voters' names and 
addresses from public and private sources." Id. The committee 
report noted, "[b]ecause of a large population and high voter mobility, voter lists, especially that for [O
'ahu], are becoming 
increasingly difficult to maintain accurately. This provision will aid the clerk of Honolulu and the clerks of the neighbor 
islands, as their populations increase, to continually update 
their lists." Id. Act 26 amended the Hawaii Revised Statutes by 
adding chapter 11, which includes HRS §§ 11-23 and 11-25. 1970 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 26, § 2 at 24-25. Under HRS §§ 11-23(a) and 
11-25(a), the county clerk is empowered to investigate challenges 
to a voter's registration. The legislative history of HRS 
chapter 11 shows the legislature empowered the county clerk to 
"investigate" and rule upon voter registrations under HRS § 11-25 
to "assist" the county clerk in keeping voter registrations up to 
date. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 589, in 1969 House Journal at 
852.
 
Hawai
'i courts have delineated the jurisdictional 
boundary between the courts, the county clerk, and County Boards' 
respective authorities to decide whether a person's residency 
status makes her or him eligible for elected office or "to be or 
to remain registered" as a voter. In Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 
Hawai'i 297, 219 P.3d 1084 (2009), a County Board did not exceed 
its jurisdiction when it ruled on candidate Solomon Kaho
'ohalahala's registration as a voter in L ana'i county for Maui 
County Council election purposes. See id. at 316, 219 P.3d at 
1103. The Dupree court specified the County Board did not exceed 
its jurisdiction under HRS chapter 11 because it ruled "only on 
Kaho'ohalahala's right to be or remain a registered voter" under 
HRS § 11-25(a), and "did not mention any possible consequences for Kaho
'ohalahala's candidacy under the provisions applicable to 
a candidate whose nomination papers have been successfully 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
challenged" under HRS § 12-8 (2009 Repl.).6 Dupree, 121 Hawai 'i 
at 316, 219 P.3d at 1103 (emphasis added). Likewise, the 
Dejetley court distinguished the factual determination of whether 
Kaho'ohalahala was a resident "for purposes of his public office 
residency requirement" from a County Board's determination that Kaho
'ohalahala was not a resident "for purposes of voter 
registration." Dejetley, 122 Hawai 'i at 267 n.36, 226 P.3d at 
437 n.36. 
Circuit courts have jurisdiction over "actions or 
proceedings in or in the nature of . . . quo warranto[.]" 
HRS § 603-21.7(b) (1993). A writ of quo warranto inquires into 
the authority by which a State official claims her or his office. 
HRS § 659-1 (1993). The Dejetley court concluded that a writ of 
quo warranto "seemed to be an appropriate remedy" for 
Kao'halahala's alleged violation of § 3-3 of the Charter of the 
County of Maui residency requirements, which automatically and instantly created a forfeiture and vacancy of his office. 
Dejetley, 122 Hawai
'i at 266, 226 P.3d at 436. In Office of 
Hawaiian Affairs v. Cayetano, 94 Hawai 'i 1, 8, 6 P.3d 799, 806 
(2000), the State sought a judicial declaration that the Office 
of Hawaiian Affairs trustees appropriately held their elected 
offices after the U.S. Supreme Court held trustees' eligibility 
requirements to be unconstitutional. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
concluded, "the State should seek relief through a quo warranto petition filed pursuant to HRS chapter 659." Id. 
Here, the circuit court dismissed the Petition for lack
 
of jurisdiction pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(1). However,
 
HRS § 603-21.7 expressly grants the circuit court jurisdiction to
 
entertain such petitions.
7
 
Therefore, we conclude the circuit court reversibly
 
6
 Circuit courts, and not County Boards, hear complaints relating to
nomination papers. See HRS § 12-8(h).
 
7
 The circuit court did not dismiss the petition for failure to
state a claim pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6), and Say did not so move. That
 
issue is not before us. It was not raised and addressed below. This case is
 solely about the jurisdiction of the circuit court to entertain a Petition for
Quo Warranto pursuant to HRS § 603-21.7.
