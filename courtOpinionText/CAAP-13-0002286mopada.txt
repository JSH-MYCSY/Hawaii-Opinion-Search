v.
 
CHRISTOPHER F. CARROLL,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0500(3))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J. and Leonard, J.
with Reifurth, J. concurring separately)
 
This appeal arises from Appellant/Appellee State of
 
Hawai'i Department of Human Services' (DHS) confirmation of 
psychological abuse against Client A by Appellee/Appellant
 
Christopher F. Carroll (Carroll), Client A's husband. On July
 
12, 2011, the Administrative Appeals Office of the Department of
 
Human Services (Appeals Office) determined DHS' confirmation of
 
psychological abuse was incorrect and dismissed the action
 
(Administrative Decision). On March 14, 2013, the Circuit Court
 
1
of the Second Circuit  (circuit court) entered its "Order
 
Reversing Administrative Hearing Decision and Remanding for
 Further Proceedings" and on April 17, 2013, entered Judgment in

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
favor of DHS and against Carroll. Carroll appealed the Judgment
 
to this court on July 23, 2013.
 
On appeal, Carroll contends the circuit court erred by:
 (1) reversing the Administrative Decision because there
 
was no prejudice to substantial rights of DHS and the decision
 was not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and
 substantial evidence in the whole record;
 
(2) relying on facts not in evidence;
 (3) concluding the Administrative Decision erroneously
 
relied on a June 7, 2011 order by the Family Court of the Second
 Circuit (family court) that also involved alleged abuse of Client
 
A by Carroll (FC Order);
 
(4) concluding the FC Order did not have a preclusive
 
effect on the present claim of abuse;
 
(5) reviewing the Administrative Decision under the
 
wrong standard of review;
 
(6) concluding the administrative record supported the
 
determination that Client A was a vulnerable adult.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
2
On October 2, 2009, DHS confirmed  psychological abuse
by Carroll against Client A. The confirmation was based on a
 
September 10, 2009 Report Form for Adult Abuse and Neglect
 (September Report), which was "completed by a professional (the
 
confidential reporter) who was trained to identify clearly
 
observable indications of abuse or neglect between family members
 and to take necessary action to prevent further harm to members
 of that family." On August 30, 2010, DHS sent Carroll a "Notice
 of Disposition" informing him of the confirmation of
 psychological abuse. DHS also provided notice that same day,
 that under HAR § 17-1421-15 (2009), Client A "no longer requires
 protective services." Carroll requested an administrative
 hearing to challenge DHS' confirmation of psychological abuse on
 November 16, 2010.

 Confirmed "means that an investigation conducted by the department
revealed reasonable cause to believe that vulnerable adult abuse had
 
occurred." Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 17-1421-2 (2009).

1. Appeals Office Proceedings
 
The issue before the Appeals Office was whether DHS
 
"properly confirmed psychological abuse of a [45-year-old]
 
vulnerable adult by her husband, [Carroll], as alleged in the DHS
 [September Report]." Hearings were held on January 27, 2011,
 February 24, 2011, March 17, 2011, April 20, 2011, May 24, 2011,
 and June 28, 2011.
 
2. Family Court Proceedings and Decision
 
On March 9, 2011, while the Appeals Office proceedings
 
were underway, DHS filed an "Ex Parte Application for Immediate
 Protection" (Petition for Protection) per Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 346-231 (Supp. 2013), for Client A, the alleged
 
vulnerable adult.
3 The application provided there was probable
 
cause to believe Client A was a vulnerable adult, and had
 
incurred abuse or was in danger of abuse, within the meaning of
 HRS § 346-222, based on "the facts stated in the Report to the
 [family court] dated February 28, 2011" (February Report)
 
(Emphasis added.) The application did not reference the
 
September Report of psychological abuse that was confirmed by DHS
 and under review by the Appeals Office. The application provided
 that Client A "does not consent to these proceedings, however,
 there is probable cause to believe that the subject lacks the
 capacity to effectively make decisions concerning her person by
 
3	 HRS § 346-222 (Supp. 2013) provides:
 
§346-222 Definitions.
 
. . . .
 "Vulnerable adult" means a person eighteen years
of age or older who, because of mental, developmental,
or physical impairment, is unable to:
 
(1) 	Communicate or make responsible decisions
to manage the person's own care or
resources;
 
(2)	 Carry out or arrange for essential
activities of daily living; or
 
(3)	 Protect oneself from abuse, as defined in
this part.

reason of the facts stated in the letter from [George Powell,
 
M.D.], dated January 13, 2010."
 
The February Report prepared by DHS provided:
 
G. Reason Person is Vulnerable:
 
[Client A] has been diagnosed with an inoperable brain
tumor and is dependant on others for all of her
personal needs, care and protection. [Client A] is
presently placed out of the home voluntarily due to
allegations of physical abuse allegedly perpetrated by
[Carroll] and teenage son.
 
H. Person has been abused as follows:
 
[Client A] reports being consistently hit on the
bottoms of her feet by [Carroll] and states that this
is done as no bruises will show. [Client A] further
reports that [Carroll] slaps, punches and chokes her
and if she is standing he will grab her very roughly
by the shoulders and throw her on to the bed. This
 type of behavior has allegedly been witnessed by
[Client A's] in home service provider. [Client A]
further states that she is very frightened of
[Carroll] and her son who has also reportedly choked
her and allegedly informed her that he wishes she
would die and that she was dead.
 
I. Person is subject to the following imminent abuse:
 
At this time [Client A] is in a safe environment;
however if returned to the home she states that she
 will continue to be abused both physically and
psychologically. [Client A] states that she is very
fearful of [Carroll] and states that she does not want
to return home. . . . At this time [Client A] is
again wanting to return to the family home which
places her at risk for further harm. On 2/28/11
[Client A] was admitted to . . . Maui Memorial
Hospital and remains there at this time.
 
DHS filed a Petition for Protection on March 9, 2011 and a
 
Petition for Appointment of a Guardian of an Incapacitated Person
 on March 17, 2011. The family court heard the petitions on April
 21, 2011 and May 27, 2011 and denied them both on June 7, 2011.
4
 
Regarding the Petition for Protection, the family court
 
found the DHS failed to prove "by a preponderance of the
 evidence" that Client A "is a vulnerable adult who has incurred
 abuse or is in danger of abuse if immediate action is not
 taken[.]" Regarding the Petition for Guardianship of an
 Incapacitated Person, the family court found DHS has not proven
 
4
 The Honorable Michelle L. Drewyer presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"by clear and convincing evidence that . . . [Client A], is an
 
incapacitated person[.]"
3. Administrative Decision
 
At the final Appeals Office hearing, held on June 28,
 
2011, the DHS representative and Carroll informed the hearings
 officer of the family court's June 7, 2011 denial of DHS'
 petitions for protection and guardianship. The hearings officer
 requested the parties submit the referenced family court
 documents. The Administrative Decision, issued July 12, 2011,
 concluded the facts the family court considered in the Petition
 for Protection proceedings "were the same facts presented at this
 hearing and seemed to involve the same time frame." The
 Administrative Decision concluded further that the family court's
 holding that DHS "did not prove by a preponderance of the
 evidence that [Client A] had incurred abuse requires that the
 charge of psychological abuse against [Carroll] be dismissed."
4. Circuit Court Proceedings and Decision
 
On August 2, 2011, DHS appealed the Administrative
 
Decision to the circuit court. The circuit court concluded the
 Administrative Decision was "clearly erroneous because the facts
 and issues relevant to the June 7, 2011 [family court] order were
 different from the facts and issues relevant to the instant
 administrative proceeding." The circuit court concluded
 collateral estoppel did not apply because the issue presented in
 the family court proceeding and the Appeals Office proceedings
 differed: "The instant appeal relates to [the September Report,]
 a report of psychological abuse . . . . The issue presented in
 the [family court] proceeding involved [the February Report] of
 physical abuse that allegedly occurred approximately seventeen
 months later." Consequently, on March 14, 2013 the circuit court
 held:
 
Although there is merit to both arguments to support either
confirmation of psychological abuse of Client A, a
vulnerable adult, by [Carroll] or that the hearing officer
reached the correct result in dismissing DHS' action, the
[circuit court] respectfully disagrees that either position
is dispositive in favor of [DHS] or [Carroll].
 
The record herein supports a determination that Client
A was a vulnerable adult on September 10, 2009. However,
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
dismissal of DHS' determination based on the June 7, 2011
[family court] order was clearly erroneous.
 
Based on the foregoing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,
ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that  the July 12, 2011 [Administrative
Decision] is reversed. This matter is remanded for further
 
proceedings on the issue of whether the alleged conduct
complained of constitutes psychological abuse as defined in
the Hawai' i Adult Protective Services Act, to wit, [HRS],
§ 346-221, et seq.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"On secondary judicial review of an administrative decision,Hawai[']i appellate courts apply the same standard of review
as that applied upon primary review by the circuit court."
Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor & Indus.Relations
, 70 Haw. 72, 80, 762 P.2d 796, 800-01 (1988). For 
administrative appeals, the applicable standard of review isset forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 91-14 (2004),which provides: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it
may reverse or modify the decision and order if
the substantial rights of the petitioners may
have been prejudiced because the administrative
findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority
or jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the
reliable, probative, and substantial
evidence on the whole record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, capricious, or
characterized by abuse of discretion
or clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion.
 
HRS § 91-14(g). Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g)(5),administrative findings of fact are reviewed under theclearly erroneous standard, which requires [the appellate]court to sustain its findings "unless the court is left witha firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made." Bumanglag v. Oahu Sugar Co., Ltd., 78 Hawai' i 275,
279, 892 P.2d 468, 472 (1995) (block format and citationomitted). Administrative conclusions of law, however, arereviewed under the de novo standard inasmuch as they are"not binding on an appellate court." Id. (block format and 
citation omitted). "Where both mixed questions of fact andlaw are presented, deference will be given to the agency'sexpertise and experience in the particular field and thecourt should not substitute its own judgment for that of the 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agency." Dole Hawaii Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71
Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990). "To be granted
deference, however, the agency's decision must be consistent
with the legislative purpose." Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw.
212, 216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984).
 
Peroutka v. Cronin, 117 Hawai 'i 323, 326, 179 P.3d 1050, 1053 
(2008).5 
"Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction 
is a question of law reviewable de novo." Kaho'ohanohano v. 
Dep't of Human Serv., State of Hawai 'i, 117 Hawai 'i 262, 281, 178 
P.3d 538, 557 (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The circuit court erred by reversing and remanding the
Administrative Decision because DHS' substantial rights were not
prejudiced.
 
To reverse or modify an agency decision under HRS § 91­
14(g), "the appellate court must conclude that an appellant's 
substantial rights were prejudiced by the agency." S. Foods 
Grp., L.P. v. State, Dep't of Educ., 89 Hawai 'i 443, 453, 974 
P.2d 1033, 1043 (1999); see also Nakamine v. Bd. of Trustees, Employees' Ret. Sys., 65 Haw. 251, 254, 649 P.2d 1162, 1164 (1982) (vacating the circuit court's reversal of an agency decision and remanding, because "[W]hat is lacking is any finding that [claimant's] substantial rights had been prejudiced by the unlawful procedure."). Cf. Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 61 ("The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.") 
DHS' substantial rights were not prejudiced. By
 
confirming the September Report of psychological abuse, DHS
 
5
 Citing In re Wai' ola O Moloka' i, Inc., 103 Hawai' i 401, 420, 83
P.3d 664, 683 (2004), Carroll contends our review is "qualified by the
principle that the agency's decision carries a presumption of validity, andappellant has the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that thedecision is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in itsconsequences." (Emphasis omitted.) However, "the 'unjust and unreasonable'language represents one application of the more general abuse of discretionstandard of review; this language does not and will not apply to discretionarydecisions of administrative agencies outside of the [Public UtilitiesCommission] ratemaking context." Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104Hawai'i 412, 419, 91 P.3d 494, 501 (2004). 
7
  No order for immediate protection appears of record regarding the
 
September Report of psychological abuse, nor does it appear that
 DHS sought such an order. On the same day DHS confirmed the
 September Report of psychological abuse, it determined, per HAR
 
6
§ 17-1421-15 (2009),  that Client A no longer required protective
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determined, through an investigation, that reasonable cause
 existed to believe that Carroll psychologically abused a
 vulnerable adult. See HAR § 17-1421-2 (2009). However, HRS
 
§ 346-231(a) provides:
 
§346-321 Order for immediate protection.  (a) If the
department believes that a person is a vulnerable adult and
it appears probable that the vulnerable adult has incurred
abuse or is in danger of abuse if immediate action is not
taken and the vulnerable adult consents, or if the
vulnerable adult does not consent and there is probable
cause to believe that the vulnerable adult lacks the
 capacity to make decisions concerning the vulnerable adult's
person, the department shall seek an order for immediate
protection in accordance with this section
.
 
6	 HAR § 17-1421-15 provides:
 
§17-1421-15 Termination of service. Protective services 
shall be terminated under one of the following conditions:
 
(1)	 When, after reasonable effort is made by
the department to provide protective
services, the department determines
through personal observation, discussion
with the vulnerable adult and available
 family members, friends, other collaterals
or legal guardian that the vulnerable
adult does not require or no longer needs
protection and is able to manage in an
alternate living arrangement or at home,
with or without supportive services,
without danger;
 
(2)	 When, after reasonable effort is made by
the department to provide protective
services, the vulnerable adult continues
to resist contact with the department, and
there are insufficient grounds to pursue
legal guardianship;
 
(3)	 The vulnerable adult withdraws consent for
 the provision of services and there are
insufficient grounds to pursue legal
guardianship;
 
(4)	 The court dismisses the petition for legal
guardianship and the vulnerable adult
refuses to accept services from the
department;
 
(continued...)

(...continued)6
. . . .
(7)The vulnerable adult dies.
7We take judicial notice of this fact per Hawaii Rules of Evidence
(HRE) Rule 201.  See In re # ¦ao Ground Water Mgmt. Area High-Level Source
Water Use Permit Applications, 128 Hawai# i 228, 255, 287 P.3d 129, 156 (2012)
("There is precedent for taking judicial notice of facts as reported by
newspapers.") (citing Application of Pioneer Mill Co., 53 Haw. 496, 497 n.1,
497 P.2d 549, 551 n.1 (taking judicial notice that a land court judge had
announced his candidacy for public office, based upon newspaper articlessubmitted by the parties).  Attached to Carroll's Opening Brief is Client A's
obituary and DHS does not contest the fact of Client A's passing.
9services. Client A passed away in January 2012, before the
circuit court decision was issued,7 so a protective order can no
longer be granted.  See generally HRS § 346-231.  And, DHS'
family court Petition for Protection order did not involve DHS'
confirmation of the September Report, as DHS confirmed in circuit
court:
The [FC Order] has no relation to the subject of this
appeal and underlying administrative hearing.  The issue in
this appeal and the underlying administrative hearing
[concerns the September Report].  The [FC Order] concerned
[the February Report] of physical abuse received 17 months
later . . . .
The [September Report] of psychological abuse of
[Client A] by [Carroll] is an entirely separate matter and
is based on an entirely different set of facts than the
[February Report] of physical abuse of [Client A].
(Emphasis omitted.)  Assuming the hearings officer erred by
relying on the family court decision, we discern no prejudice to
the substantial rights of DHS, the appellant before the circuit
court.  See generally Application of Wind Power Pac.
Investors-III, 67 Haw. 342, 343, 686 P.2d 831, 832-33 (1984)
("While the [agency] may not have followed procedural
requirements to the letter, we hold that the irregularities
complained of do not prejudice the substantial rights of [the
appellant].") (citing HRS § 91–14(g) and Survivors of Medeiros v.
Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 66 Haw. 290, 299, 660 P.2d 1316, 1319
(1983)).  Consequently, the circuit court erred by reversing and
remanding the Administrative Decision.  We need not address the
merits of Carroll's other points on appeal. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
