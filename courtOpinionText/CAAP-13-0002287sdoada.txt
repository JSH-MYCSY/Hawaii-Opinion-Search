APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 11-1-2095 AND 12-1-1758)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant/Plaintiff-Appellant R. Onaga, Inc. (Onaga)
 
appeals from the: (1) July 5, 2013 "Judgment Granting Plaintiff's
 
Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All
 Defendants" (Judgment); (2) July 5, 2013 "Order Granting
 
Plaintiff Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment for Foreclosure Against All Defendants and for
 Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure"; and (3) July 3, 2013 "Order
 Denying Defendant R. Onaga, Inc.'s Cross Motion for Summary
 Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure," all filed
 
1
in the Circuit Court of First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
The Judgment was entered in favor of 
Plaintiff/Defendant-Appellee the Bank of New York Mellon fka the Bank of New York (
Bank) and against Defendant-Appellant Onaga, 
and Defendants-Appellees Robert Nisperos Marquez and Marlyn Miranda Marquez, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., Castle & Cooke Mortgage, LLC, the State of Hawai
'i Department of 
Taxation, and the United States Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service. 
Onaga contends the circuit court erred by: 
(1) granting the Bank's motion for summary judgment
 
(Bank's MSJ) based exclusively on a declaration of indebtedness
 
by an employee of the Bank's servicing agent, Residential Credit
 
Solutions, Inc., and exhibits attached to the declaration; 
(2) concluding it had jurisdiction in the Bank's
 
judicial mortgage foreclosure action based on its clearly
 erroneous finding that the Bank was the holder of "the Note and
 Mortgage by the Assignment of Mortgage filed in Land Court on
 March 31, 2011[;]" 
1
 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) concluding the Bank's mortgage was a valid first 
mortgage on a residential property located at 95-1112 Kelakela 
Street, Mililani, Hawai 'i by finding that the Bank's assignment 
of mortgage was filed and registered in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court on March 31, 2011; and 
(4) denying its cross-motion for summary judgment.
 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank. Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(e) (2000) 
imposes the following requirements for affidavits submitted in connection with a motion for summary judgment: 
Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal
knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible
in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant
is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.
Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof
referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or
 served therewith.
 
The Bank submitted the affidavit of Melissa Black 
(Black), in the form of a "Declaration of Indebtedness," and 
exhibits attached thereto, in support of the Bank's MSJ. We 
conclude that Black's affidavit and the attached exhibits did not comply with the requirements of HRCP Rule 56(e). See HRCP Rule 
56(e); see also GE Capital Hawaii, Inc. v. Yonenaka, 96 Hawai
'i 
32, 39-40, 25 P.3d 807, 814-815 (App. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Price v. AIG Hawai
'i Ins. Co. Inc., 107 Hawai 'i 106, 
111-12, 111 P.3d 1, 6-7 (2005); Hawaii Community Federal Credit 
Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai 'i 213, 221-23, 11 P.3d 1, 9-11 (2000). 
As a result, the Bank failed to present sufficient admissible
 
evidence to support its motion for summary judgment, and the
 
circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the
 
Bank.
 
Because we conclude that the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank, we need not
 
address Onaga's second and third points of error because they

arise out of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment. With
 
respect to Onaga's fourth point, we conclude that the circuit
 
court did not err in denying Onaga's cross-motion for summary
 
judgment because there are genuine issues as to material facts.
 
See HRCP Rule 56(c) (2000). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's July 3, 2013 "Order Denying Defendant R. Onaga,
 Inc.'s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory
 
Decree of Foreclosure" is affirmed. The July 5, 2013 "Judgment
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of
 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants" and the July 5, 2013 "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff the Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee's
 
Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure Against All
 
Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure," are
 
vacated and this case is remanded to the circuit court for
 
further proceedings consistent with this order.
