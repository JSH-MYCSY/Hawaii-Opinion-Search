I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 4, 2012, Dolan was charged in the district 
court with one count of OVUII for an incident that occurred on 
November 18, 2012. Dolan pled not guilty on December 19, 2012. Dolan filed a Motion to Suppress on April 30, 2013, arguing that Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officer Alan Ahn (Officer Ahn) 
illegally ordered Dolan out of his vehicle. Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai
'i (State) did not file a memorandum in opposition 
to Dolan's Motion to Suppress, but opposed the motion at a hearing on June 20, 2013. 
At the June 20, 2013 hearing, Officer Ahn testified
 
that upon arrival at the scene of the November 18, 2012 incident,
 and before approaching Dolan, he spoke with HPD officer
 Christopher Chung (Officer Chung), who was already at the scene. 
Officer Ahn testified that Officer Chung instructed him to
 
conduct a Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) on Dolan after
 
explaining that he had observed Dolan "jump the curb and drive
 
his car on the sidewalk" and perceived "signs of alcohol
 consumption indicia, odor of alcohol, slurred speech, [and a]
 red, flush face." Dolan's counsel objected on the basis of
 hearsay, and the district court overruled the objection under the
 "state of mind" exception. Officer Ahn further testified that it
 was a bright and sunny afternoon, and that prior to instructing
 Dolan to exit his vehicle for a SFST, he observed Dolan with a
 red and flushed face and sitting in the driver's seat of a car
 that was parked "a little askew" and probably with one wheel "up
 on the curb."
 
The State argued that the Motion to Suppress should be
 
denied because
 
[f]or probable cause purposes, the knowledge of one officer
is the knowledge of all officers when the officers are
working together. . . . Officer Chung informed Officer Ahn
of the reason for the stop and also the indicia of alcohol,
specifically the odor of alcohol and the slurred speech.
And so . . . there is reasonable suspicion for the stop.
And there's also . . . enough evidence from that to order
[Dolan] out of the vehicle to perform the . . . [SFST]. So
 based on the testimony of Officer Ahn, he's working together
with Officer Chung; he received information from Officer
Chung; that was the basis for ordering the [Dolan] out of
the car.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In denying Dolan's Motion to Suppress, the district
 
court stated:
 
even considering [Dolan's] argument that Officer Ahn cannot
rely on what Officer Chung told him, I think what the Court
thinks -- or finds, that what is significant, that upon
Officer Ahn's arrival at the scene of Bishop and Queen that
he noticed red and flush -- red and flushed face of [Dolan],
albeit on a bright, sunny afternoon or day. But most
 significantly, even without talking to Officer Chung,
Officer Ahn testified that he did see [Dolan's] car on
the -- one wheel on the curb. Taking both of those facts
together, Court finds significant basis for Officer Ahn to
proceed further with the investigation. And as such, the
Motion to Suppress is denied.
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
Dolan argues that the district court erred in denying
 
the Motion to Suppress because Officer Ahn's observations did not
 
constitute "a reasonable basis of specific articulable facts to
 believe the crime of [OVUII] ha[d] been committed."
 
The State argues that the district court correctly
 
denied the Motion to Suppress because Officer Ahn's observations,
 in combination with Officer Chung's observations, constituted
 "sufficient evidence . . . to find reasonable suspicion to stop
 and reasonable grounds to order [Dolan] out of his vehicle."
 
"[W]hen a police officer stops an automobile and 
detains its occupants, a 'seizure' occurs so as to implicate the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution" and thus a warrant is required. State v. 
Prendergast, 103 Hawai
'i 451, 453-54, 83 P.3d 714, 716-17 (2004) 
(citing Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653 (1979) and State v. Bolosan, 78 Hawai
'i 86, 92, 890 P.2d 673, 679 (1995)). Under an 
exception to the warrant requirement, "a police officer may stop an automobile and detain its occupants if that officer has a 'reasonable suspicion' that the person stopped was engaged in criminal conduct." Prendergast, 103 Hawai
'i at 454, 83 P.3d at 
717 (citing Bolosan, 78 Hawai 'i at 94, 890 P.2d at 681). 
"Reasonable suspicion" exists when the police officer can point to "specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant" the investigative stop. Prendergast, 103 Hawai
'i at 454, 83 P.3d at 
717 (citing State v. Barnes, 58 Haw. 333, 338, 568 P.2d 1207, 1211 (1977)). When determining whether reasonable suspicion

exists, a court should consider "the totality of the 
circumstances measured by an objective standard." Prendergast, 
103 Hawai 'i at 454, 83 P.3d at 717 (citing United States v. 
Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002)). 
The district court did not err in denying Dolan's
 
Motion to Suppress because under the totality of the
 circumstances, Officer Ahn was justified in asking Dolan to exit
 his vehicle and submit to a SFST. Officer Ahn observed Dolan
 sitting in the driver's seat of a parked vehicle that had one
 wheel on the curb and that Dolan's face was red and flushed. The
 district court did not err in finding that, even without the
 information relayed to Officer Ahn by Officer Chung, Officer
 Ahn's ordering of Dolan out of his car was justified.
III. CONCLUSION
 
The District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 
Division's "Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 Plea/Judgment" filed June 20, 2013 and "Notice of Entry of
 Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment" filed July 9, 2013 are
 affirmed.
