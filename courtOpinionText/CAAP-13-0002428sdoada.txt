1240.8 (Supp. 2013),  for offenses that occurred on September 13,
2012 and October 3, 2012. 

Awana raises a single point of error on appeal, i.e.,
 
that the Circuit Court "erred in admitting the evidence of
 
anonymous tips, undercover surveillance and Chong's bad acts of
 
th th
September 11  and 12  of 2012." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced, applicable authorities, and the issues
 raised by the parties, we resolve this point of error as follows:
 
Hawai
'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 402 provides: 
"All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise
 
2	 HRS § 712-1240.8 states the following: 
[§ 712-1240.8] Methamphetamine trafficking in the
second degree. (1) A person commits the offense of
methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree if the
person knowingly distributes methamphetamine in any amount.
(2) Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree
is a class B felony for which the defendant shall be
sentenced as provided in subsection (3).
(3) Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640,
706-641, 706-660, 706-669, and any other law to the
contrary, a person convicted of methamphetamine trafficking
in the second degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate
term of imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum
term of imprisonment of not less than one year and not
greater than four years and a fine not to exceed
$10,000,000; provided that:
(a)	 If the person has one prior conviction for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this
section or section 712-1240.7, the mandatory
minimum term of imprisonment shall be not less
than three years, four months and not greater
than six years, eight months;
(b)	 If the person has two prior convictions for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this
section or section 712-1240.7, the mandatory
minimum term of imprisonment shall be not less
than six years, eight months and not greater
than ten years; or
(c)	 If the person has three or more prior
convictions for methamphetamine trafficking
pursuant to this section or section 712-1240.7,
the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment shall
be ten years.

provided by the Constitutions of the United States and the State 
of Hawaii, by statute, by these rules, or by other rules adopted by the supreme court. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible." Relevant evidence, according to HRE Rule 401, is defined as "evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Thus, "the relevance inquiry requires a two-step analysis: (1) is the fact for which the evidence is proffered of consequence to the determination of the action; and (2) does the proffered evidence tend to alter the probability of that fact." State v. Kupihea, 80 Hawai
'i 307, 315, 909 P.2d 1122, 1130 (1996) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). A trial court's determinations concerning relevance under HRE Rule 401 and 402 are reviewed under the right/wrong standard. See State v. St. 
Clair, 101 Hawai
'i 280, 286, 67 P.3d 779, 785 (2003); State v. 
Duncan, 101 Hawai 'i 269, 274, 67 P.3d 768, 773 (2003). 
HRE Rule 403 states that "[a]lthough relevant, evidence 
may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence." According to the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, "unfair 
prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one." State v. Behrendt, 124 Hawai
'i 90, 120, 237 P.3d 1156, 
1186 (2010) (emphasis, citations, internal quotation marks, and 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
brackets omitted). We review the Circuit Court's determination 
regarding HRE Rule 403 under the abuse of discretion standard. Duncan, 101 Hawai
'i at 274, 67 P.3d at 773. Thus, error will 
only be found if the court "clearly exceed[ed] the bounds of reason or disregard[ed] rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. (citation 
omitted). 
In the present case, the anonymous complaints and the
 
August surveillance were both relevant and admissible. The
 evidence was offered to provide an explanation for the subsequent
 police actions taken in investigating Awana and the narcotics
 trafficking activity around the Cartwright Field area in general. 
This was "of consequence to the determination of the action"
 because it revealed why the police were investigating the area in
 the first place, and it highlighted that they had a specific
 purpose and agenda. In other words, the evidence provided
 
important background information regarding the nature and extent
 
of the undercover operation that led to Awana's arrest. See
 
State v. Agrabante, 73 Haw. 179, 199, 830 P.2d 492, 502 (1992)
 (explaining that evidence regarding an undercover investigation
 "was relevant background information regarding the nature and
 extent of the undercover investigation and the reverse buy
 operation" in addressing the defendant's prosecutorial misconduct
 argument). Thus, although the evidence did not link Awana to the
 activities reported in the anonymous complaints or place her in
 the vicinity of Cartwright Field, it was nevertheless relevant
 because it made the testimony regarding police actions leading up
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to Awana's arrest "more probable . . . than it would be without
 
the evidence." See HRE Rule 401. 
Similarly, the evidence regarding Chong's acts on
 
September 11 and 12 of 2012 was also relevant and admissible. 
The evidence was offered for the purpose of explaining police
 actions in their investigation of Awana, as well as for the
 purpose of providing credibility to the police identifications of
 Awana on September 13 and October 3, 2012. This was "of
 consequence to the determination of the action" because it
 provided pertinent background information on the extent and
 nature of the police investigation, and it also served to
 undercut Awana's defense that Officer Chun mistakenly identified
 her and that "proper procedures were not followed in this case." 
The evidence of Chong's acts on September 11 and 12, 2012 was
 relevant. It explained the police actions taken and the
 procedures leading up to the investigation of Awana. Thus, this
 evidence rendered the police testimony regarding Awana and the
 investigation more probable than it would have been without the
 evidence. See HRE Rule 401. The evidence of Chong's September
 
11 and 12, 2012 acts was also relevant to show that the police
 identifications of Awana on September 13 and October 3, 2012
 underwent a consistent, similar protocol to the successful
 identifications of Chong on September 11, 12, and 13, 2012. The
 testimony regarding Officer Chun's interactions with Chong on
 September 11 and 12, 2012 thus made it more probable that he did
 not mistakenly identify Awana, which thereby made it more
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
difficult for Awana to use misidentification as a plausible,
 
viable defense. See HRE Rule 401.
 
We also conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse
 
its discretion when it determined that the probative value of the
 evidence was not substantially outweighed by any risk of unfair
 prejudice or other danger under HRE Rule 403. Awana was not
 implicated in any illegal activities before September 13, 2012,
 as it is undisputed that the evidence made no mention of Awana in
 the anonymous complaints, the August surveillance, or the
 interactions with Chong on September 11 and 12, 2012. In fact,
 the State acknowledged that "the evidence will show that [Awana]
 was never on the police's radar, namely, they were unaware of
 her" and that "[t]he prosecution isn't inferring that she was
 there on those days." In addition, the Circuit Court issued a
 limiting instruction specifically precluding the jury from
 considering the evidence as establishing Awana's "bad character"
 or "as indicating that [Awana] may have acted in conformity
 therewith on any other occasion." Cf. State v. Austin, 70 Haw.
 
300, 308-09, 769 P.2d 1098, 1102-03 (1989) (evidence of major
 undercover drug operation overly prejudicial where guilt by
 association was too strong and no limiting instruction was
 given). We reject Awana's assertion that the Circuit Court's
 limiting instruction did nothing to "mitigate the harm from the
 admission of [the] evidence" because the court "absolutely failed
 to give its limiting instruction on the second day of trial when
 a different witness testified." The court read the limiting
 instructions on the first day of the trial prior to the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
presentation of the evidence, as Awana requested upon an inquiry
 
by the court. Awana provides no authority or explanation as to
 why the court was required to repeat its limiting instruction
 again before the testimony on the second day of trial, nor does
 she show that the record reflects that she requested the limiting
 instruction to be read at that time. The instruction was given
 again later on the second day, prior to jury deliberations.
 
For these reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court's July
 
9, 2013 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence.
