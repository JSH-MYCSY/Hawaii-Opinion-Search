IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
WILLIAM MIDDLETON, Appellant-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES,
Appellee-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-001196)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
This secondary appeal from an administrative proceeding 
arises out of a dispute over entitlement to receive Supplemental 
Nutritional Assistance Program ("SNAP") benefits. Appellant-Appellant William Middleton, pro se, appeals from the July 1, 2013 Final Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court") in favor of Appellee-Appellee State of Hawai
'i Department of Human Services ("DHS") and against 
Middleton.1/ 
We conclude that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in denying Middleton's motion to set aside the
 dismissal. Therefore, we vacate the July 1, 2013 Final Judgment
 and remand the case to the Circuit Court for proceedings
 consistent with this memorandum opinion. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 19, 2012, the DHS Administrative Appeals
 
Office ("Appeals Board") held an administrative hearing in which
 
Middleton contested the August 23, 2011; August 25, 2011;
 September 2, 2011; September 23, 2011; December 7, 2011;

 The Honorable Rhonda Nishimura presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
December 12, 2011; December 15, 2011; December 30, 2011;
 
February 17, 2012; and March 5, 2012 notices from DHS informing
 him that his monthly SNAP benefits would be reduced.
2/ After the
 
hearing and the submission of documents into evidence, on
 March 30, 2012, the Appeals Board issued two decisions, both
 determining that DHS correctly reduced Middleton's SNAP benefits,
 and found in favor of DHS ("March 30, 2012 Decisions"). 
On April 30, 2012, Middleton appealed from the 
March 30, 2012 Decisions to the Circuit Court. On June 15, 2012, the certified record on appeal was filed in the Circuit Court. Pursuant to the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP"), 
Middleton was required to file his opening brief by July 25, 2012. Haw. R. Civ. P. 72(f)(1). Nevertheless, Middleton failed to file an opening brief or request an extension of time. 
On September 6, 2012, the Circuit Court issued its
 
Order of Dismissal based on Middleton's "failure to comply with
 Rule 72, Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure." The Circuit Court
 further ordered that "[t]his dismissal may be set aside and the
 action reinstated by order of the court for good cause shown upon
 motion duly filed not later than ten (10) days from the date of
 this order of dismissal." 
Middleton filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, in 
which he argued that the Circuit Court failed to indicate which section of HRCP Rule 72 he failed to comply with, and therefore the Circuit Court's September 6, 2012 Order of Dismissal was vague. Middleton asserted that he had complied with all sections of what he knew to be HRCP Rule 72, and attached copies of HRCP Rule 72 which were printed in April 2007 and February 2008 from the State of Hawai
'i Judiciary website. Under the versions of 
HRCP Rule 72 printed in April 2007 and February 2008, Rule 72(f) did not state the requirement that an opening brief is due within 40 days after the filing of the record on appeal. Instead, Rule 72(f) was "Reserved." DHS did not file an opposition to Middleton's motion to set aside the dismissal. On October 9, 2012, the Circuit Court issued its Order Denying Motion to Set

pro se throughout the entire series of proceedings.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Aside Dismissal in which the court summarily denied the motion 
"pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 72." 
On November 2, 2012, Middleton filed an Ex-Parte Motion
 
for Clarification and Ex-Parte Motion for Reconsideration
 ("Motion for Clarification/Reconsideration"), in which he offered
 multiple medical problems and issues with accessing his record as
 additional reasons for not filing his opening brief in a timely
 manner. Without waiting for a ruling on his Motion for
 Clarification/Reconsideration, on November 9, 2012, Middleton
 appealed to this court from the Order of Dismissal and the Order
 Denying Motion to Set Aside Dismissal. The Motion for
 Clarification/Reconsideration was denied on December 20, 2012
 with the notation, "For lack of jurisdiction. Case is at
 Intermediate Court of Appeals."
 
On April 9, 2013, this court issued its Order
 
Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction because the Circuit
 Court's Order of Dismissal and Order Denying Motion to Set Aside
 Dismissal had not been reduced to a separate judgment. On
 April 22, 2013, Middleton filed an Ex-Parte Motion for Final
 Judgment, Order or Decree, and the Circuit Court issued its
 July 1, 2013 Final Judgment. 
Middleton timely appealed from the July 1, 2013 Final
 
Judgment to this court.
 
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, although Middleton labels a section of his
 
opening brief as "Points of Error and Argument," he fails to
 
identify discrete points of error on appeal. We construe
 Middleton's arguments to assert that the Circuit Court abused its
 discretion when it (1) dismissed his appeal for failing to file
 an opening brief, (2) denied his motion to set aside the
 dismissal, and (3) denied his Motion for Clarification/
 Reconsideration.
 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Dismissal for Procedural Default
 
"[T]he proper standard of review [regarding] the
 
[circuit court's] decision not to excuse a procedural default
 
3
  
           NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . is abuse of discretion. With respect to excuse of 
procedural default, we have previously held in similar circumstances that a court has discretion to accept or reject an untimely filed brief." In re Estate of Kam, 110 Hawai
'i 8, 24, 
129 P.3d 511, 527 (2006) (citing Yee v. Okamoto, 44 Haw. 119, 120, 352 P.2d 854, 855 (1960) (noting that the trial court has discretion to accept or reject a late brief based on the reasons for untimeliness)). "[T]o constitute an abuse of discretion a court must have clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26-27 (1992) (citing State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992)). 
IV.	 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it
 
dismissed Middleton's appeal for failing to file an
opening brief, pursuant to HRCP Rule 72(f)(1).
 
We construe Middleton's argument on appeal to assert
 
that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing his appeal for failure
 
to file an opening brief in a timely manner. Middleton asserts
 that the Circuit Court's Order of Dismissal is vague for not
 explicitly stating which subsection of HRCP Rule 72 the Circuit
 Court relied upon to dismiss the appeal. We disagree.
 
HRCP Rule 41(b)(2) provides,
 
For failure to prosecute or to comply with these rules
or any order of the court, the court may sua sponte dismiss an
action or any claim with written notice to the parties. Such
dismissal may be set aside and the action or claim reinstated
by order of the court for good cause shown upon motion duly
filed not later than 10 days from the date of the order of
dismissal.
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 41(b)(2). Unless a circuit court's order of
 
dismissal specifies otherwise, the dismissal is with prejudice. 
See Haw. R. Civ. P. 41(b)(3).
3/  Effective on January 1, 2012,
 
3/
 HRCP Rule 41(b)(3) states:
 
Unless the court in its order for dismis
sal otherwise
 
specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any
(continued...)
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 72 was updated to include HRCP 72(f), which requires
 
that an opening brief be filed "within 40 days after the filing
 of the record on appeal." Haw. R. Civ. P. 72(f)(1).
 
In this case, Middleton appealed from the March 30,
 
2012 Decisions to the Circuit Court on April 30, 2012. The
 certified record on appeal was filed in the Circuit Court on
 June 15, 2012. Pursuant to HRCP Rule 72(f)(1), Middleton was
 required to file his opening brief by July 25, 2012. Middleton
 did not file his opening brief by July 25, 2012, nor did he
 motion the Circuit Court to extend the time in which he could
 file an opening brief.
 
On September 6, 2012, the Circuit Court issued the
 
Order of Dismissal. The Order of Dismissal stated that "[t]his
 dismissal may be set aside and the action reinstated by order of
 the court for good cause shown upon motion duly filed not later
 than ten (10) days from the date of this order of dismissal."
4/
 
The Circuit Court's dismissal was with prejudice, as the order
 did not state otherwise.
 
Further, Middleton's complaints regarding the
 
specificity of the ruling are without merit. "The trial judge is
 required to 'only make brief, definite, pertinent findings and
 conclusions upon the contested matters; there is no necessity for
 over-elaboration. . . .'" Doe v. Roe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 565, 705
 
P.2d 535, 542 (1985) (quoting Tugaeff v. Tugaeff, 42 Haw. 455,
 467 (1958)). The Circuit Court specified in the Order of
 Dismissal that Middleton had failed to comply with HRCP Rule 72. 
Middleton's failure to do so notwithstanding, the rule was
 
3/(...continued)
dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for
failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an
adjudication upon the merits.
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 41(b)(3).
 
4/
 Although the Circuit Court does not explicitly state that it had
authority to dismiss Middleton's appeal for a violation of HRCP Rule 72(f)
under HRCP Rule 41(b) or explain where it derived its authority at all, it
appears from the language in its Order of Dismissal that it was proceeding
under that latter rule. Accordingly, we consider case law that addresses
discretionary dismissals under HRCP Rule 41(b).
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonably easy to determine and thereafter to comply with, and
 
further explanation in the order was not required.
 
Accordingly, pursuant to HRCP Rules 41(b) and 72(f)(1),
 
the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed
 Middleton's appeal for failing to file an opening brief, but
 afforded him the option to file a motion to have the dismissal
 set aside for good cause.
 
B.	 The Circuit Court abused its discretion when it denied
 
Middleton's motion to set aside the dismissal.
 
We construe Middleton's second argument on appeal to 
assert that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it 
denied his motion to set aside the Order of Dismissal after he demonstrated "more than just 'good cause . . . .'" Middleton argues that he complied with the requirements of HRCP Rule 72, and that his pro se status requires this court to be "flexible." In support of his argument Middleton cites to O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai
'i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994). We 
conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in failing to set aside the Order of Dismissal. 
With regard to the untimely filing of the opening 
brief, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has stated, 
[t]his court does not condone or excuse any infraction of the
established and promulgated rules of judicial procedure.
Where, however, the non-compliance is factually found not to
have been the result of indifference or callous disregard, but
attributable to an honest mistake, and where there has been no
palpable prejudice to other parties in the case, this court is
warranted, under Rule 3(f), in considering such mitigating
circumstances as may be presented.
 
Yee, 44 Haw. at 122, 352 P.2d at 856 (the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
determining that failure to file an opening brief within the time 
allowed did not justify dismissal of appeal, where counsel mistakenly believed that he had sixty days to file the opening brief on appeal, and upon learning of his mistake notified appellees, the court, and filed a motion for an extension of time for filing the brief); cf. Trask v. Tam See, 42 Haw. 324, 325 (Terr. 1958) (denying the motion to dismiss appeal after appellant showed mitigating circumstances); but see Iwamoto v. Medeiros, 26 Haw. 235, 235 (Terr. 1922) (dismissing appeal 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because appellant did not file or seek an extension of time to
 
file his opening brief or "make any showing that might excuse his
 inaction"); Keahilihau v. King, 25 Haw. 139, 140 (Terr. 1919)
 (dismissing the appeal upon appellant's failure to file his brief
 in a timely manner despite procuring extensions of time to do so;
 noting that "[n]o facts have been made to appear . . . as to why
 the brief was not filed within the time allowed"). 
Although the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 
when it issued its Order of Dismissal, and although we do not
 condone or excuse any infraction of the established and
 promulgated rules, we conclude that the Circuit Court abused its
 discretion under these circumstances when it denied Middleton's
 motion to set aside the dismissal. In his motion, Middleton
 explained that he believed that he had complied with HRCP Rule
 72, and he indicated through the materials he filed that he was
 mistakenly relying on outdated versions of HRCP Rule 72 that did
 not contain subsection (f). Specifically, Middleton attached two
 pages from the HRCP, which were obtained and printed from the
 judiciary website in April 2007 and February 2008. Neither
 version of the rules had conditions listed under HRCP Rule 72(f). 
Instead, both printouts of the rules stated "(f) Reserved." 
While using an out-of-date version of the HRCP is Middleton's
 mistake, it does appear to reasonably suggest that Middleton's
 non-compliance with HRCP Rule 72(f) was not the result of
 "indifference or callous disregard," and DHS has not asserted
 that they have been prejudiced in any way. Yee, 44 Haw. at 122,
 
352 P.2d at 856.
 
The Circuit Court displayed professional courtesy
 
toward Middleton, even as he contended that the court was wrong
 about what HRCP Rule 72 required of him. Nevertheless, in light
 of Middleton's pro se status, his apparent reliance on an (out­of-date) resource that misled him into believing that he had done
 all that he needed to do, the lack of any evidence that DHS would
 have been prejudiced by setting aside the dismissal, and that we
 can read into Middleton's defense of non-filing an intention to
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5/DHS notes that Middleton has filed at least seventeen prior civil
actions, and argues that although Middleton is a pro se litigant, "he is not
unfamiliar with the law and the filing of court pleadings."  Elsewhere,
however, DHS recognizes that Middleton's failure to file an opening brief "was
based on his failure to ensure that his copy of Rule 72 was current,"
contending that this was "not an honest mistake, but a lack of diligence."  
8file an opening brief if the court would set aside his default,5/
we conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in
denying Middleton's motion to set aside the dismissal.  See Ryan
v. Palmer, 130 Hawai #i 321, 323, 310 P.3d 1022, 1024 (App. 2013)
(holding that the failure to file a pretrial statement did not
warrant dismissal with prejudice for want of prosecution, and
"[a]bsent a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct, the
careful exercise of judicial discretion requires that a trial
court consider less severe sanctions and explain, where not
obvious, their inadequacy for promoting the interests of
justice." (quoting In re Blaisdell , 125 Hawai #i 44, 49, 252 P.3d
63, 68 (2011))).  Because we have determined that the Circuit
Court abused its discretion in denying the motion to set aside
the dismissal, we need not address Middleton's final argument.
