Defendant-Appellant Susan A. Chin (Chin) appeals from
 
the July 19, 2013 "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence"
 
(judgment) entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). Chin was found guilty of Count 1, theft in the
 
first degree under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 708­

Counts 4 and 6, money laundering under HRS § 708A-3(1)(a)(ii)
 
(Supp. 2013).4 Chin was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment

 jury foreperson had communicated with Chin's chief witness during
 trial; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to establish her
 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in Counts 1, 4, and 6.

(B)	 Avoid a transaction reporting
requirement under state or federal
law[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Chin's points of error as follows: 
Chin first contends there was insufficient evidence to
 
find her guilty of Count 1, first degree theft, based on
 Katherine K. Ganeko's (Katherine) uncontradicted testimony that
 
she gave Chin power-of-attorney to conduct her affairs; that
 
Katherine knew Chin had opened joint accounts; that Katherine
 testified she wanted to live with Chin and have Chin responsible
 for her caretaking; that Katherine received Chin's caretaking
 services; that Katherine was treated as part of Chin's family;
 and that Katherine did not state that Chin had refused to return
 her money.
 
A person commits theft if they "[o]btain[] or exert[] 
unauthorized control over the property of another with intent to
 deprive the other of the property." HRS § 708-830. A person
 commits theft in the first degree if they commit theft "[o]f
 property or services, the value of which exceeds $20,000[.]" HRS
 § 708-830.5(1)(a). 
The standard of review for Chin's appeal from the 
circuit court's denial of her motion to acquit is whether "the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact, a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai
'i 60, 69, 148 P.3d 493, 502 
(2006) (quoting State v. Maldonado, 108 Hawai 'i 436, 442, 121 
P.3d 901, 907 (2005)). 
Chin contends she should have been acquitted of first
 
degree theft under Count 1 because she acted under a power-of­attorney that included a provision that ratified all of her acts
 as agent for Katherine. According to Chin, her control over
 house sale proceeds was not "unauthorized" within the meaning of
 HRS § 708-830 because she held a power-of-attorney, and therefore
 she did not commit theft in the first degree.
 
The assumption of a power-of-attorney creates a
 
fiduciary duty in the person assuming that power. Breaches of
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fiduciary duties are not authorized uses of that power. Under
 
HRS Chapter 346, Part X "Adult Protective Services," the misuse
 of a power-of-attorney is one kind of breach of a fiduciary duty:
 
§346-222 Definitions.  For the purposes of this part:
 
. . . .
 
"Financial exploitation" means the wrongful taking,
withholding, appropriation, or use of a vulnerable adult's
money, real property, or personal property, including but
not limited to:
 
(1)	 The breach of a fiduciary duty, such as the
misuse of a power of attorney or the misuse of
guardianship privileges, resulting in the
unauthorized appropriation, sale, or transfer of
property[.]
 
HRS § 347-222 (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added). 
The instrument creating a power of attorney is strictly
construed to authorize only those actions expressly provided. 
Where a power-of-attorney authorizes an agent broad powers to

 
"perform every act, deed or thing that [the principal] might or
 could do if personally present" and specifically authorizes that
 agent to deal with the principal's real property "as [the agent]
 shall think fit[,]" this court has determined that the power-of­attorney did not "expressly authorize" the agent to make gifts of
 the principal's property. Kunewa v. Joshua, 83 Hawai
'i 65, 72, 
924 P.2d 559, 566 (App. 1996); see also State v. Crowder, 11 P.3d
 828, 832 (2000), as amended (Wash. App. Oct. 27, 2000) (holding
 that the agent's durable power of attorney did not authorize her
 to make gifts of the principal's property).
 
 
In Kunewa, this court looked to 
"[w]ell established rules of interpretation of powers of
attorney [under which] broad, all-encompassing grants of
power to the agent must be discounted." Mercantile Trust
 
Co. v. Harper, 622 S.W.2d 345, 349 (Mo. App. 1981) (citing
Restatement (Second) of Agency § 34, cmt. h (1958)). See
 
also Estate of Casey v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue
, 948 F.2d
[895, 900-01 (4th Cir. 1991)] (where power of attorney
expressly authorized agent to transfer principal's assets by
sale, lease, or mortgage, but omitted any reference to the
power of transfer by gift, the expansive language of the
power of attorney would be interpreted to confer only those
incidental, interstitial powers necessary to accomplish
objects as to which authority has been conferred and not to
confer power to make a gift).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kunewa, 83 Hawai 'i at 72, 924 P.2d at 566. A gift is "the 
voluntary transfer of property to another without compensation." 
Black's Law Dictionary 803 (10th ed. 1979). 
The instrument granting Chin power-of-attorney did not
 
expressly authorize Chin to give Katherine's property interests
 as gifts or to breach any fiduciary duties. Therefore, Chin's
 conveyance of the proceeds from the sale of Katherine's house to
 Chin's sons and mother were not authorized under Chin's power-of­attorney. 
Viewing record evidence in a light most favorable to
 
the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the
 jury as a trier of fact, the record shows Chin deposited proceeds
 from the sale of Katherine's house into joint accounts with
 Chin's sons and mother; filed a missing person's report, when
 family took Katherine away, in which she claimed $76,000 in a
 joint account funded with the proceeds of the sale of Katherine's
 house were actually Chin's monies from a pre-existing account;
 and used $8,834 from a joint account funded by house sale
 proceeds for a personal car payment. A reasonable mind might
 fairly conclude Chin was guilty of first degree theft of the
 proceeds from the sale of the house beyond a reasonable doubt. 
In Count 4, Chin was found guilty of money laundering 
under HRS §§ 708A-3(1)(a)(ii) and 708A-3(4)(b), and subject to sentencing under HRS § 708-3(5)(b), for Chin's substitution of her sister for Chin as a joint account holder on accounts with Chin's sons. To be convicted under HRS § 708A-3(1)(a)(ii), Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) was required to show 
Chin knew the proceeds from the house sale were proceeds from "some form of unlawful activity," and that Chin transported, transferred, received, or acquired the proceeds, or conducted a transaction involving the proceeds, knowing that such action was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity. The State was also required to show that the value of the property transported, transmitted, transferred, received, or acquired was $10,000 or more. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Katherine testified she said that she would set aside
 
$200,000 of the house sale proceeds for Chin's sons' education. 
But as discussed supra, we concluded Chin was not authorized to
 make gifts of the house sale proceeds by the power-of-attorney. 
Chin's theft of the house sale proceeds satisfies the first
 element of money laundering under HRS § 708A-3(1). The record
 also reflects testimony from bank managers that Chin elected to
 substitute her sister as the joint account holder with Chin's
 mother and sons after Chin discovered that Katherine had
 withdrawn the balance of the joint account held by Chin and
 Katherine. A bank manager testified that Chin told him Chin's
 attempts to withdraw monies from the accounts were meant to
 protect those monies from Katherine. Viewed in a light most
 favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable mind might fairly
 conclude Chin's bank transactions were "designed in whole or in
 part to: [c]onceal or disguise the nature, the location, the
 source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of
 specified unlawful activity[,]" such that Chin was guilty of the
 second element of money laundering under HRS § 708A-3(1), and
 that the value of the property at issue was $10,000 or more.
 
Chin was convicted under Count 6, money laundering
 
under HRS §§ 708A-3(1)(a)(ii) and 708a-3(4)(b), for her use of
 stolen proceeds to make a payment on her personal car loan. Chin
 contends she should have been acquitted of Count 6 because she
 did not conceal or disguise her use of the joint account with her
 mother (funded with the sale of proceeds from Katherine's house)
 to satisfy her car payment and that this use of Katherine's funds
 was consistent with the purpose of taking care of Katherine's
 transportation needs. Chin had deposited monies from the sale of
 Katherine's house into a joint account with her mother and wrote
 a check from that account for $8,834 with the notation "Mercedes
 Pay off" on the check instrument. As discussed supra, the
 deposit of house sale proceeds into the joint account with Chin's
 mother was unauthorized and constituted theft. Viewing the
 evidence in a light favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable
 mind might fairly conclude Chin's use of Katherine's funds to pay
 Chin's car loan was a means of concealing or disguising
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Katherine's ownership of the $8,834 so as to constitute money
 
laundering under HRS § 708A-3. 
In her third point of error, Chin contends the evidence
 
in the case did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt her guilt
 as to Counts 1, 4, and 6. The standard of review on appeal for
 sufficiency of the evidence is substantial evidence. See State
 
v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007). Substantial evidence is "credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a [person] of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." State v. Batson, 73 
Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992). "[E]ven if it could be said . . . that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence to support the requisite findings for conviction, the [conviction] will be affirmed." Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331. 
Admitted evidence, declarations, and trial testimony
 
noted above constituted substantial evidence supporting the
 jury's findings that Chin had committed acts underlying Counts 1,
 4, and 6. 
Chin's final contention is that the circuit court erred 
by failing to grant her Motion for a New Trial after learning of juror misconduct. The circuit court found Chin's suggestion that contact between her witness and the juror may have had a significant inappropriate influence upon the deliberative process was "pure speculation." In support of its finding, the circuit court cited State v. Amorin, 58 Haw. 623, 574 P.2d 895 (1978), in which the Hawai
'i Supreme Court concluded the assumption that 
"the rest of the jurors were influenced by the mere knowledge that a juror had looked up the definition of 'insanity' without any indication that they either knew what the definitions were or how the particular juror had voted would be pure conjecture." Amorin, 58 Haw. at 631, 574 P.2d at 900. 
[N]ot all juror misconduct necessarily dictates the granting
of a new trial. A new trial will not be granted if it can
be shown that the jury could not have been influenced by the
alleged misconduct. Rule 52(a) of the Hawaii Rules of
Criminal Procedure directs that any error will be harmless
and disregarded if it does not affect the substantial rights
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of the complaining party. Further, it must be shown beyond
a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless.
 
Amorin, 58 Haw. at 630, 574 P.2d at 900 (footnote and citations
 
omitted). 
As the circuit court found, the only evidence
 
supporting Chin's motion for a new trial was the declaration
 submitted by her witness. Chin's witness declared that a juror
 inquired into employment possibilities, but that the juror did
 not have any further communication with him after their encounter
 in the men's bathroom. Chin argued to the circuit court that her
 witness's non-responsiveness to the juror's inquiries into
 employment "may have had a significant inappropriate influence on
 the deliberative process in this case" and cited Maryland case
 law holding "[c]ontacts between witnesses and jurors are
 generally improper because such contacts raise fundamental
 concerns on whether the jury would reach their verdict based
 solely on the evidence presented at trial or whether it would be
 improperly influenced by inappropriate contacts." Dillard v.
 
State, 3 A.3d 403, 408-09 (Md. Ct. App. 2010) (citations and
 internal quotation marks omitted). The facts underlying Dillard
 concern the following: during lunch recess two jurors patted the
 State's witness on the back and said, "good job[;]" the trial
 court discussed the matter with counsel outside of the jury's
 presence; the defense counsel acknowledged there was no
 inappropriate State action, but motioned for a mistrial; the
 trial court allowed the defense counsel to question the State's
 witnesses as to the incident; and denied the defense counsel's
 motion for a mistrial or in the alternative to replace one of the
 jurors. Dillard, 3 A.3d at 406-07. Under the Maryland "abuse of
 
discretion" standard of review for rulings on a motion for a
 mistrial (Allen v. State, 597 A.2d 489, 497 (Md. Ct. Sp. App.
 1991)), the Dillard court held that the trial court abused its
 discretion by failing to "clarify the factual scenario raised by
 the contact between the jurors and [the State's witness] . . . ." 
Dillard, 3 A.3d at 410. 
Chin contends the circuit court "refused to conduct
 
such an inquiry" into the juror's motive for violating its prior
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
instruction to the jury not to talk to witnesses in the case, and 
therefore she is entitled to a new trial. Chin misstates the circuit court's duties to inquire into her allegations of juror misconduct. Chin was required to "make a prima facie showing of a deprivation that could substantially prejudice his or her right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. [The Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court] also suggested that defendant should first present some specific, substantial evidence showing a juror was possibly biased." State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai
'i 474, 479, 122 P.3d 254, 
259 (2005) (citations omitted and format altered). Had the circuit court "determine[d] that the alleged deprivation [was] substantially prejudicial, the [circuit] court then [became] duty bound to further investigate the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged deprivation to determine its impact on jury impartiality." Yamada, 108 Hawai
'i at 479, 122 P.3d at 259 
(citations omitted and format altered). In this case, the circuit court found the nature of the deprivation alleged by Chin did not rise to the level of substantial prejudice as required by State v. Furutani, 76 Hawai
'i 172, 873 P.2d 51 (1994), and 
further noted that the "timing and mixed nature of the verdicts undermine[d Chin's] argument that she was deprived of a fair trial by an impartial jury." Citing Furutani, 76 Hawai
'i at 181, 
873 P.2d at 60 (holding that the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the juror's misconduct "could substantially prejudice [his or her] right to a fair trial by an impartial jury." (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
Hawai
'i courts do not disturb a trial court's grant or 
denial of a motion for a new trial "absent a clear abuse of discretion." State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai
'i 474, 478, 122 P.3d 
254, 258 (2005). This standard applies in the context of a motion for new trial premised on juror misconduct. Id. 
According to Chin, the juror's misconduct may have created bias against the defense because her witness's non-responsiveness to the juror's employment inquiry may have influenced the juror inappropriately. Chin's allegation of inappropriate influence is so attenuated by a chain of inferences as to fail to establish the circuit court's finding of "pure speculation" to be a clear 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
abuse of discretion. We conclude the circuit court did not abuse
 
its discretion by finding that Chin's allegations of juror
 misconduct did not constitute "substantial prejudice." 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 19, 2013 "Judgment
 
of Conviction and Sentence" entered in Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit's is affirmed.
