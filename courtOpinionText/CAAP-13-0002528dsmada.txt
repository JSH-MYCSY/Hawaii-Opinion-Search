v.
 
JAMIN KENT FOOTE,
Defendant/Third-Party-Plaintiff/Appellee,

EDWARD D. GULLIVER, M.S. DVM, dba LEEWARD PET CLINIC,
Third-Party Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC12-1-4445)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over this appeal that Third-Party Defendant-
Appellant Edward D. Gulliver, M.S. DVM, dba Leeward Pet Clinic
 (Appellant Gulliver) has asserted from the district court’s (the
Honorable Gerald H. Kibe and Honorable Maura M. Okamoto
 presiding) May 9, 2013 default judgment, June 7, 2013 order
 denying Appellant Gulliver’s motion to set aside, and July 1,
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2013 order denying Appellant Gulliver’s motion for
 
reconsideration, because the district court has not yet entered
 an appealable final order or final judgment in this case.
 
Appellant Gulliver is appealing pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). 
The district court has not entered a final order or 
final judgment that fully disposes of all of the claims in this 
district court litigation matter. We have held that a default judgment was immediately appealable in a case, but only where "there [wa]s only one plaintiff, one defendant, and once claim involved in this case." Casuga v. Blanco, 99 Hawai
'i 44, 51, 52 
P.3d 298, 305 (App. 2002) (opinion by Watanabe, J.). In contrast 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to the situation in Casuga v. Blanco, the instant case involves 
multiple claims, and while the May 9, 2013 default judgment enters judgment in favor of Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/ Appellee Jamin Kent Foote (Appellee Foote) and against Appellant Gulliver as to Appellee Foote’s third-party complaint, the May 9, 2013 default judgment does not adjudicate Plaintiff-Appellee Collection Management Services of Hawaii, Inc.’s, complaint for breach of contract against Appellee Foote. In other words, the May 9, 2013 default judgment does not end the litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of all parties and leave nothing further to be adjudicated, as HRS § 641-1(a) requires under the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142. Therefore, the May 9, 2013 default judgment does not qualify as an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, and, consequently, the June 7, 2013 order and the July 1, 2013 order are merely interlocutory orders that are not eligible for appellate review until a party asserts a timely appeal from an appealable final judgment or appealable final order in this case. Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawai
'i 386, 
396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) ("An appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
 
exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine
 (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS
 § 641-1(b), Appellant Gulliver does not satisfy the requirements
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order 
doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent an appealable order or appealable judgment, this
 
appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 appellate court case number CAAP-13-0002528. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0002528 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
