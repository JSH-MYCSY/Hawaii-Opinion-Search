ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Employer-
Appellant Ean Holdings, LLC and Insurance Carrier-Third-Party
 Administrator-Appellant Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance/York
 Financial Services (formerly Avizent) (collectively Appellants).
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellants appeal from a Decision and Order, filed on
 
March 20, 2013, by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 
Board (LIRAB). 
1
Pursuant to HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2012)  and HRS § 91­
2
14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012),  an aggrieved party may appeal a final
decision and order by the LIRAB directly to the Intermediate
 Court of Appeals.
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is governed
by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals in
administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes judicial
review of a final decision and order in a contested case or a
 preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief. For purposes of HRS § 91-14(a), we have defined
"final order" to mean an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89
 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The supreme court has "held
 that an order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under
 the worker's compensation law is an appealable final order under
 HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo
 
1
 "The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final and
conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless within thirty days
after mailing of a certified copy of the decision or order, the director or
any other party appeals to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate board."
HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2011) (in part).
2
 HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2011) provides:
 
§ 91-14. Judicial review of contested cases.
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested
case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of adequate
relief is entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter; but nothing
in this section shall be deemed to prevent resort to other means of review,
redress, relief, or trial de novo, including the right of trial by jury,
provided by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term "person aggrieved" shall
include an agency that is a party to a contested case proceeding before that
agency or another agency.

Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai 'i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 
(2004) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). 
The March 20, 2013 Decision and Order is not a final 
appealable order because it only determined that Claimant 
suffered an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and no determination of Claimant’s benefits has been made. Mitchell v. State, 77 Hawai
'i 307-08, 884 P.2d 368, 370-71 
(1994). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
