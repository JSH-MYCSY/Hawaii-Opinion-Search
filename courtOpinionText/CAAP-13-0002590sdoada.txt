Polendey was charged as follows:
 
On or about the 17th day of November, 2012, in
the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, MARK
POLENDEY, a person whose license and privilege to
operate a vehicle had been revoked, suspended, or
otherwise restricted pursuant to Section 291E-62 or to
Part III of Chapter 291E or Section 291E-61, or 291E­61.5, or to Part VII or Part XIV of Chapter 286 or
Section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or 291-7 of
the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes  as those provisions were
in effect on December 31, 2001, did intentionally,
knowingly or recklessly operate or assume actual
physical control of any vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway in violation of any
restrictions placed on his license, and/or while his
license or privilege to operate a vehicle remained
suspended or revoked, thereby committing the offense
of Operating a Vehicle After License And Privilege
Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle
Under the Influence of An Intoxicant in violation of
 Section 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes. MARK POLENDEY is subject to
sentencing as a first offender in accordance with
Section 291E-62(b)(1) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
On appeal, Polendey contends the District Court erred
 
by denying his motion to dismiss the Complaint because (1) the
 
charge of violating HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) was improperly pled in
 the disjunctive, and (2) the charge of violating HRS § 291E­62(a)(2) failed to allege the requisite mens rea and an attendant
 circumstance of committing the violation on a public way, street,
 road, or highway. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Polendey's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) Polendey claims that the State erroneously pled the
 
attendant circumstances element in the disjunctive and that the
 District Court therefore erred in denying his Motion to Dismiss
 the HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) charge. Citing to Territory v. Lii, 39
 Haw. 574 (Terr. 1952), State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 283 n.4,
 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 n.4 (1977), and State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236,
 
(2)	 While the person's license or privilege to
operate a vehicle remains suspended or
revoked[.]
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291E-62(a) (Supp. 2012).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
249–50, 831 P.2d 924, 931–32 (1992), Polendey observes that case
 
law regarding disjunctive pleading has focused on the conduct
 element, but argues that the prohibition should be extended to
 attendant circumstances. Specifically, Polendey maintains that
 the attendant circumstance of his license being "revoked,
 suspended, or otherwise restricted" is improperly pled in the
 disjunctive.

In State v. Codiamat, 131 Hawai 'i 220, 317 P.3d 664 
(2013), a decision issued after Polendey filed his opening brief in the case, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that: 
[T]he complaint in this case met due process requirements,
regardless of whether one concludes that the disjunctively
charged acts were synonymous or non-synonymous. The acts
 charged disjunctively were contained within a single
subsection of a statute and were reasonably related so that
the complaint sufficiently apprised the defendant of the
nature of the charged acts and allowed the defendant to
prepare a defense.
 
Id. at 221, 317 P.3d at 665. The Court further noted that "acts 
may be charged disjunctively when the words used charge similar or analogous forms of conduct that are codified in a single subsection of a statute. Id. at 227, 317 P.3d at 671 (citing 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), another 
OVUII case). 
Even if we ignore the fact that the cases cited by 
Polendey do not extend the concern over disjunctive pleading to attendant circumstances, the words "revoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted" in the charge "are similar or analogous forms of conduct that are codified in a single subsection of the statute." Therefore, the charge meets the ultimate test of informing the accused fully of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. See Codiamat, 131 Hawai
'i at 223, 317 
P.3d at 667 (quoting Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i at 66, 276 P.3d at 
635). Thus, the charge of violating HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) was not defective for being pled in the disjunctive, and we reject Polendey's first point of error accordingly. 
3/
 "[A]n attendant circumstance is essentially a circumstance that
'exist[s] indpendently of the [actor's conduct].'" State v. Wheeler, 121
Hawai'i 383, 392, 219 P.3d 1170, 1179 (2009) (brackets in original) (quoting
State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawai' i 115, 127, 123 P.3d 1210, 1222 (2005)).

(2) Polendey's argument that the HRS § 291E-62(a)(2)
 
charge was deficient for failing to state again or separately the
 
requisite mens rea and attendant circumstance of committing the
 violation "upon a public way, street, road, or highway" is
 without merit. The charges of violating HRS § 291E-62(a)(1)
 and/or (a)(2) were stated in the alternative, so the mens rea and
 attendant circumstances applied to both charges, separately or
 together, as they were written in the Complaint. We concur with
 the State that the (a)(2) portion of the charge ("while his
 license or privilege to operate a vehicle remained suspended or
 revoked") cannot within reason be read without also reading the
 independent clause of the charge.
4 Accordingly, we reject
 
Polendey's second point of error.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on July 9, 2013 in
 the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is
 affirmed.

 The independent clause of the charge reads:
 
[Polendey], a person whose license and privilege to operate
a vehicle had been revoked, suspended, or otherwise
restricted pursuant to . . . as those provisions were in
effect on December 31, 2001, did intentionally, knowingly or
recklessly operate or assume actual physical control of any
vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway[.]
