The Apaos raise five  points of error and assert that
the circuit court erred in:

 
(1)
 granting summary judgment in favor of the Mounts
 
and U.S. Bank on all claims, and in denying summary judgment to
 the Apaos on their Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint
 (Counterclaim and TPC), because the non-judicial foreclosure was

 The Apaos raise six points of error, but under Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7), the sixth point of error, that the
circuit court abused its discretion in setting an outrageously highsupersedeas bond, is deemed waived because the Apaos made no argument tosupport this point.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conducted in violation of HRS § 667-5 and Hawaii's Probate Code
 
(Probate Code);
 
(2) entering the Writ of Possession without first 
entering a separate judgment, and its July 29, 2013 judgment violates the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's Separate Judgment Rule; 
(3) 4
awarding attorneys' fees  to U.S. Bank because the
Apaos did not have a contractual relationship with U.S. Bank, the
 mortgagee, and thus this case was not an action in the nature of
 assumpsit;
 
(4) awarding damages to the Mounts in the form of

 
attorneys' fees and costs because this case was not an action in
 the nature of assumpsit; and
 
(5) awarding supplemental damages to the Mounts because
 
the Mounts made no effort to mitigate their alleged damages.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that the
 Apaos' appeal is without merit.
(1) The circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment
in favor of the Mounts and U.S Bank and against the Apaos.
 
The Apaos argue that the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment in favor of the Mounts and U.S. Bank on
 
all claims, and in denying summary judgment to the Apaos on their
 Counterclaim and TPC, because the non-judicial foreclosure sale
 violated the Probate Code and HRS § 667-5 and thus the Mounts
 
5
were not entitled to ejectment  for lack of valid title. 
Specifically, the Apaos argue that the non-judicial foreclosure
 
4
 The Apaos raised no argument to support their contention that the
circuit court also erred in awarding costs to U.S. Bank, and therefore that
aspect of this point of error is deemed waived pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
 
5
 To maintain an ejectment action, a party must prove ownership and
title to the property at issue. State by Price v. Magoon, 75 Haw. 164, 175,
858 P.2d 712, 718-19 (1993); see also Carter v. Kaikainahaole, 14 Haw. 515,
516 (Haw. Terr. 1902) (holding that an action of ejectment is the remedy at
law for a "complainant who has the title to and right of possession of certain
land and from whom possession is unlawfully withheld by another"). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sale was invalid because: (1) U.S. Bank violated HRS § 560:3-803
 
(2006 Repl.) of the Probate Code by conducting the sale of the
 real property that is the subject of this appeal (Property)
 
without first filing either a probate claim or a judicial
 
foreclosure action; and (2) U.S. Bank violated HRS §§ 667­5(a)(2) and 667-5(c)(1) by denying the request of Alvaro's grand­niece, Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Sesha Lovelace
 (Lovelace), for reinstatement information. The Apaos' arguments
 
are without merit and therefore the Mounts were entitled to
 
ejectment.
 
a.	 The non-judicial foreclosure sale did not violate the
Probate Code.
 
The Apaos argue that U.S. Bank violated HRS § 560:3-803
 
of the Probate Code by conducting the non-judicial foreclosure
 
sale without first filing either a probate claim or a judicial
 foreclosure action because a non-judicial foreclosure sale is not
 an exempt proceeding under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1). The Mounts and
 U.S. Bank argue that U.S. Bank did not violate HRS § 560:3-803
 because a non-judicial foreclosure sale is an exempt proceeding
 under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1).
 
HRS § 560:3-803 of the Probate Code provides, in
 
pertinent part:
 
§560:3-803 Limitations on presentation of claims.
 
. . . .
 (c) All claims against a decedent's estate which
arise at or after the death of the decedent . . . are barred
 
against the estate, the personal representative, the decedent's
trustee, and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless
presented as follows:
 
(1)	 A claim based on a contract with the personal
representative or trustee, within four months
after performance by the personal representative
or trustee is due; or
 
(2)	 Any other claim, within the later of four months
after it arises, or the time specified in
subsection (a)(2).
 
(d)	 Nothing in this section affects or prevents:
 
(1)	 Any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge,
or other lien upon property of the estate[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The non-judicial foreclosure was an exempt proceeding
 
under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1) because it was a proceeding to
 
enforce a mortgage. Therefore, the Apaos' argument that the
 Mounts' title is invalid because U.S. Bank held the non-judicial
 foreclosure sale without first filing either a probate claim or
 an action for judicial foreclosure is without merit.
b.
	 The non-judicial foreclosure sale did not violate HRS
§ 667-5.
 
The Apaos contend that the non-judicial foreclosure
 
sale is void because U.S. Bank violated HRS §§ 667-5(a)(2) and
 
667-5(c)(1) by denying Lovelace's request for reinstatement
 information.
 
HRS § 667-5, provides, in pertinent part:
 
§667-5 Foreclosure under power of sale; notice;
affidavit after sale; deficiency judgments.  (a) When a
power of sale is contained in a mortgage, and where the
mortgagee . . . desires to foreclose under power of sale
upon breach of a condition of the mortgage, the
mortgagee . . . shall be represented by an attorney who is
licensed to practice law in the State and is physically
located in the State. The attorney shall:
 
. . . .

 
(2)	 Give any notices and do all acts as are
authorized or required by the power contained in
the mortgage.
 
. . . .
 
(c) Upon the request of any person entitled to notice
pursuant to this section and sections 667-5.5 and 667-6, the
attorney, the mortgagee, successor, or person represented by
the attorney shall disclose to the requestor the following
information:
 
(1)	 The amount to cure the default, together with
the estimated amount of the foreclosing
mortgagee's attorneys' fees and costs, and all
other fees and costs estimated to be incurred by
the foreclosing mortgagee related to the default
prior to the auction within five business days
of the request[.]
 
(Emphases added.)
 
A foreclosure sale is void when conducted in violation
 
of HRS § 667-5. See, e.g., Lee v. HSBC Bank USA , 121 Hawai 'i 
287, 296, 218 P.3d 775, 784 (2009) (holding that "an agreement
 
created at a foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to HRS section
 667–5 is void and unenforceable where the foreclosure sale is
 
6

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
invalid under the statute"); In re Kekauoha-Alisa, 674 F.3d 1083,
 
1089 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that when a mortgagee violates the
 "requirements of HRS § 667–5, whether those violations are
 grievously prejudicial or merely technical," the subsequent
 foreclosure sale is void). 
In the instant case, U.S. Bank, through American Home
 
Mortgage Servicing (AHMS), provided Alvaro's Estate (Estate) with
 
reinstatement information over the phone with Margaret on
 
February 25, 2010, and by letters dated February 25, 2010 and
 April 19, 2010 and mailed to the Property where Margaret was
 residing, and also through two pay-off statements in February
 2011, at least one of which Margaret received and shared with
 Dirk. The fact that Margaret received the information after
 resigning as co-personal representative (Co-PR) is irrelevant
 
because Margaret misrepresented herself to AHMS as a Co-PR of the
 
Estate and shared the reinstatement information she received with
 Dirk. Also, U.S. Bank informed Lovelace that it would provide
 her with the reinstatement information she requested if she could
 provide U.S. Bank with the Estate's account number and a credible
 document showing that she was a Co-PR, but Lovelace did not
 provide U.S. Bank with either. U.S. Bank did not violate HRS
 § 667-5(a)(2) because it provided the Apaos with reinstatement
 information, and did not violate HRS § 667-5(c)(1) because
 Lovelace failed to establish that she was a "person entitled to
 notice" under HRS § 667-5. The circuit court did not err in
 granting summary judgment in favor of the Mounts and U.S. Bank on
 all claims, and in denying summary judgment to the Apaos on their
 Counterclaim and TPC. There was no genuine issue of material
 fact as to the validity of the Mounts' title or the fact that
 Margaret continued to reside on the Property after the Mounts
 purchased the home. The Mounts were entitled to ejectment.
(2) The circuit court did not err in entering the Writ of
Possession before issuing a final judgment.
 
The Apaos argue that the circuit court erred in
 
entering the Writ of Possession before entering a judgment, and
 
that its July 29, 2013 Judgment is defective for lack of finality
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and thus was entered in violation of Hawai 'i's Separate Judgment 
Rule. The Apaos' argument is without merit because the entry of 
the Writ of Possession before the issuance of a final judgment is valid under the 
Forgay doctrine. 
The July 29, 2013 Judgment does not satisfy the 
requirements for a standard appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2008), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), because it 
expressly retains jurisdiction to determine damages and does not 
contain an express finding of no just reason for delay under HRCP Rule 54(b).
6 Regardless, however, the circuit court's entry of 
the Writ of Possession was not error because the writ was immediately appealable under the Forgay
 doctrine exception to the 
final judgment requirement. 
The Forgay doctrine is based on the United States 
Supreme Court's holding in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has acknowledged the Forgay doctrine 
as "allow[ing] an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). Under the Forgay doctrine, the supreme court "ha[s] jurisdiction to consider appeals from judgments which require immediate execution of a command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the litigation." Id. (citations, internal quotation marks, and 
brackets omitted). 
The portion of the July 29, 2013 Judgment that enters a 
judgment of possession as to Count 1 (ejectment) of the Mounts' Complaint satisfies both requirements of the 
Forgay doctrine 
6
 Under HRCP Rule 54(b), a court renders part of an otherwise non-
final judgment appealable when it includes in the judgment "an express
determination that there is no just reason for delay . . . for the entry of
judgment" as to the claims resolved by the judgment. HRCP Rule 54(b).
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because it requires immediate execution of a command that the
 
Property be delivered to the Mounts and thus the Apaos would be
 subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait
 the final outcome of the litigation. Therefore, the circuit
 court did not err in entering the Writ of Possession without
 first issuing a final judgment, or violate the Separate Judgment
 Rule, because the portion of the July 29, 2013 Judgment that
 pertains to ejectment, and the corresponding Writ of Possession,
 are appealable under the Forgay doctrine. 
Additionally, although it is unusual for a circuit
 
court to enter a writ of possession before issuing its
 corresponding judgment, the Apaos have not established how this
 timing constitutes reversible error. Even if this timing was
 error, we hold that it was harmless.
 
(3) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding
U.S. Bank attorneys' fees under HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 2008).
 
The Apaos contend that the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in awarding attorneys' fees to U.S. Bank because
 
Dirk's Counterclaim and TPC concerns wrongful foreclosure and
 thus is not an action in the nature of assumpsit under HRS § 607­14. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding
 
U.S. Bank attorneys' fees because Dirk's Counterclaim and TPC is
 
in the nature of assumpsit.

 
HRS § 607-14 provides, in pertinent part:
 
§607-14 Attorneys' fees in actions in the nature os
assumpsit, etc.  In all the courts, in all actions in the
nature of assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note
or other contract in writing that provides for an attorney's
fee, there shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by
the losing party and to be included in the sum for which
execution may issue, a fee that the court determines to be
reasonable[.]
 
"Assumpsit is a common law form of action which allows 
for the recovery of damages for non-performance of a contract, 
either express or implied, written or verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations." 808 Dev., LLC v. Murakami, 111 Hawai
'i 
349, 366, 141 P.3d 996, 1013 (2006) (quoting Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai
'i 327, 332, 31 P.3d 184, 189 (2001)). 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[I]n awarding attorneys' fees [under HRS § 607-14] in 
a case involving both assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims, a court 
must base its award of fees, if practicable, on an apportionment of the fees claimed between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims." Blair, 96 Hawai
'i at 332, 31 P.3d at 189. Such apportionment is 
not practicable when the non-assumpsit claims and assumpsit claims are "inextricably linked." Id. at 333, 31 P.3d at 190. 
If the non-assumpsit claims and assumpsit claims are inextricably linked, the court must determine the nature of the lawsuit. TSA 
Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 
734 (1999). In other words, when both assumpsit and non­assumpsit claims are asserted, a court should determine whether the action depends primarily "upon duties created by agreement among the parties." See Kamalu v. Paren, Inc., 110 Hawai
'i 269, 
275, 132 P.3d 378, 384 (2006) (holding that an action was not in the nature of assumpsit in part because it did not depend upon duties created by an agreement between the parties). 
Dirk's Counterclaim and TPC raised four counts: (1)
 
"Violation of the Probate Code" (Count I); (2) "Violation of the
 
Nonjudicial Foreclosure Statute" (Count II); (3) "Violation of
 
the Mortgage" (Count III); and (4) "Defective and Fraudulent
 
Transfer of the Mortgage" (Count IV). Count I alleges that U.S.
 
Bank violated HRS § 560:3-803 of the Probate Code by conducting
 
the non-judicial foreclosure sale without first filing either a
 probate claim or a judicial foreclosure action. Count II alleges
 that U.S. Bank violated HRS § 667-5(c)(1) by not providing the
 Estate with reinstatement information. Count III alleges that
 U.S. Bank breached terms of the mortgage on the Property
 (Mortgage) by not providing the Estate "with notice of the action
 
required to cure the default." Count IV alleges that the
 
assignment of the Mortgage to U.S. Bank was defective and thus
 U.S. Bank did not have the authority to foreclose on the
 Property. The Counterclaim and TPC prayed for a declaratory
 judgment that the non-judicial foreclosure was void, judgment
 quieting title to the Property in favor of the Apaos, damages
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resulting from the wrongful foreclosure, costs, attorneys' fees,
 
and other relief as deemed appropriate by the circuit court.
 
Dirk's Counterclaim and TPC consisted of an assumpsit 
claim and non-assumpsit claims; Counts I and II are based on alleged statutory violations, Count III is based on an alleged breach of contract, and Count IV appears to sound in tort. The damages alleged in the Counterclaim and TPC sound in both breach of contract and tort because "wrongful foreclosure" could relate to all counts. Based on "the substance of the entire pleading, the nature of the grievance, and the relief sought," S. Utsunomiya Enter. v. Moomuku Country Club, 76 Hawai
'i 396, 400, 
879 P.2d 501, 505 (1994), Counts I, II, and IV are "inextricably linked" to Count III for purposes of apportionment. Blair, 96 
Hawai
'i at 333, 31 P.3d at 190. Therefore, the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in awarding U.S. Bank attorneys' fees based on its finding that Dirk's Counterclaim and TPC was in the nature of assumpsit.
(4) The circuit court's awards of damages and supplemental
damages to the Mounts were not clearly erroneous.
 
The Apaos argue that the circuit court's award of
 
damages to the Mounts was erroneous because: (1) the Mounts
 
failed to timely file a motion for attorneys' fees, (2) the
 dispute between the Apaos and the Mounts was not in the nature of
 assumpsit, and (3) the damages award was based in part on the
 amount paid by the Mounts to rent a different property. The
 Apaos also argue that the circuit court's award of damages to the
 Mounts was inequitable because "the Mounts incurred a windfall of
 over $2.3 million of the Apaos' equity" by purchasing the
 Property for $1.2 million when it had an alleged fair market
 value of $3,535,000. The Apaos further argue that the circuit
 court's award of supplemental damages to the Mounts was in error
 because the Mounts failed to mitigate damages by concealing the
 Writ of Possession, conducting a surprise eviction, and
 harassing, terrorizing, and forcibly removing the Apaos from the
 Property.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Apaos' arguments are without merit. At a September
 
16, 2013 hearing, the circuit court explained that the Apaos'
 
motion for attorneys' fees was timely; determined "that
 sufficient proof has been adduced to award the Mounts' damages
 based on their deprivation of possession of the property under
 Count I, ejectment"; and concluded that attorneys' fees under HRS
 § 607-14 was appropriate because Dirk's Counterclaim and TPC
 against the Mounts was in the nature of assumpsit.
 
For the reasons set forth supra, Dirk's Counterclaim
 
and TPC was in the nature of assumpsit. Therefore, we hold that
 the circuit court did not err in awarding the Mounts attorneys'
 fees under HRS § 607-14 because the Mounts incurred attorneys'
 fees while defending themselves against Dirk's Counterclaim and
 TPC.
 
With regard to the timeliness of the Mounts' motion for

 
attorneys' fees, the circuit court explained:
 
THE COURT: Attorney's fees and costs was subsumed
within their motion for award of damages, and that was filed
within the 14 days after the July 29th judgment; right?
 
MR. ARENSMEYER: But their attorney's fees and costs

was as a basis for damages under their ejectment claim. If
 you go back and look at the original motion and what the
Court had set the hearing for, it was a hearing on damages
under the ejectment claim, that's all that remained at
issue. They did not file a motion under 607-14 pursuant to
the counterclaim or any of the other claims in the case. And
the Court simply doesn't have jurisdiction at this time to
make such an award.
 
THE COURT: 
They filed it based on 606 – wait, 667-33
and you guys both argued that. And at the last hearing I
said -- I said 667-33 will not be applied by this court.
But the court then indicated, I said 607-14 appeared to be
applicable. So then you folks were both committed to brief
that. So I disagree with your contention that its late.
 
The Apaos have failed to cite anywhere in the record or
 
any authority to discredit the circuit court's reasoning and thus
 
we decline to find the circuit court's conclusion that the motion
 was timely to be error.
 
With regard to damages based on deprivation of
 
possession, the circuit court and counsel for the parties (Mr.
 Chapman for the Mounts and Mr. Arensmeyer for the Apaos) engaged
 in the following discussion:
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[THE COURT:] It is this Court's determination that
 
sufficient proof has been adduced to award the Mounts

damages based on their deprivation of possession of the
property under Count 1, ejectment. Per the declaration
 submitted by the plaintiffs and the supporting exhibits, the
Mounts have incurred significant expenses for the
deprivation of the possession of the property from July 22,
2011, that's the date of the deed, to the present time, such
expenses include property taxes, insurance, the water bill,
rental expenses to rent alternate property.
 
. . . .

 
Mr. Chapman, can I inquire as to -- based on the
documentation presented, that was as of August 27, we're now
in September and the declaration had indicated that the rent
was currently $6500 per month. So the Court is contemplating
adding the 6500 based on the one month after. I mean, we're
now in September, and the declaration is as of August 27th.
 
MR. CHAPMAN:
 Yes, Your Honor, I think that would be a
valid assumption that the rental is continued to date in the
same amount as indicated in Mr. Mount's declaration.
 
THE COURT: 
I think it was at least a rental
 
agreement.
 
MR. CHAPMAN: 
We also have some other incidental costs
 
that have been incurred and will be incurred in the

 
completion of the ejectment which we would like leave to
supplement the record.
 
THE COURT: 
Okay. I've granted leave as to that.
 
MR. CHAPMAN: 
Thank you, Your Honor.
 
THE COURT: 
You want to make a record.
 
MR. ARENSMEYER: I wish to object for the record.
There's simply no basis in the law whatsoever to base these
damages on another property other than the subject [P]roperty. To
 point to another property that's 6500 a month, what if they had
rented a property that was 10,000 a month, or 20,000 a month? The
Court needs to focus on the deprivation for use of this
[P]roperty, not another property.
 
THE COURT:  Okay, your objection is noted.

 
Although the Apaos argue that the circuit court erred
 
in including in its damages calculations the amount paid by the
 
Mounts to rent a different property while Margaret refused to
 vacate the Property, the Apaos fail to provide this court with
 binding or persuasive authority to support their argument, and we
 cannot find any instructive Hawai
'i cases. We therefore hold 
that the circuit court's decision to award damages for rent paid
 by the Mounts was not erroneous.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
With regard to whether the circuit court's damages
 
award was inequitable because the Mounts paid substantially less
 
for the property at the non-judicial foreclosure sale than the
 alleged fair market value, this argument is without merit. It is
 not unusual for a parcel of real property to be sold at a price
 far less than its fair market value at a non-judicial foreclosure
 sale; this is a risk that the mortgagor takes when it enters into
 a mortgage that provides for the default remedy of non-judicial
 rather than judicial foreclosure.
 
Finally, the circuit court did not err in awarding
 
supplemental damages to the Mounts based on the costs that they
 incurred to gain possession of the Property; such a basis is
 appropriate. And the Apaos' argument that the Mounts failed to
 mitigate their damages by concealing the Writ of Possession,
 conducting a surprise eviction, and harassing, terrorizing, and
 forcibly removing the Apaos from the Property is unsupported by
 the record.
