IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROY RITA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 02-1-0139)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Roy Rita (Appellant Rita) has asserted with respect to Appellant
 Rita’s April 3, 2012 post-judgment motion for DNA testing
 pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 844D-121 (Supp.
 2013), because the presiding judge, the Honorable Randal G.B.
 Valenciano, has not yet entered a post-judgment order that
 adjudicates Appellant Rita’s April 3, 2012 post-judgment motion
 for DNA testing.

"Appellate jurisdiction in a criminal case is purely
 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or
 
statutory provision." State v. Baxley
, 102 Hawai 'i 130, 133, 73 
P.3d 668, 671 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks
 omitted). The supreme court has
 
enumerated several bases for jurisdiction from a circuit
court judgment, stating that, in a criminal case, a
defendant may appeal from the judgment of the circuit court
. . . (1) pursuant to HRS § 641-11, (2) from an
interlocutory order . . . pursuant to HRS § 641-17, (3) by
virtue of the collateral order doctrine, . . .
(4) by applying for a writ of prohibition or mandamus under
HRS § 602-5(4), . . . and (5) by requesting exercise of this
court's supervisory powers pursuant to HRS § 602-4[.]
 
Id. at 139, 73 P.3d at 677 (citations, internal quotation marks, 
original brackets, and footnote omitted). Furthermore, pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (Supp. 2013) and "HRPP Rule 40(h), appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
In the instant case, yet another statute controls the
 
issue of appellate jurisdiction. Appellant Rita filed his
 April 3, 2012 post-judgment motion for DNA testing pursuant to
 HRS § 844D-121. "In accordance with applicable rules of court,
 the defendant may appeal to the supreme court and intermediate
 court of appeals from an order denying a motion made pursuant to
 this part." HRS § 844D-129 (Supp. 2013). The circuit court has
 not yet entered a written order that adjudicates Appellant Rita’s
 April 3, 2012 post-judgment motion for DNA. Absent the entry of

a written post-judgment order that is appealable pursuant to HRS
 
§ 844D-129 , Appellant Rita’s appeal is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-13­0002651. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
or requests in CAAP-13-0002651 are denied as moot.
