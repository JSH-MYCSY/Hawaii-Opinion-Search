SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
The instant appeal arises out of an action for
 
foreclosure. Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Counterclaim-
Plaintiff/Appellant Robert K.R. Quartero (Robert) appeals pro se
 
from the December 21, 2012 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
Order Granting Bank of Hawaii's Motion for Summary Judgment
 Against All Parties and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure
 Filed July 16, 2012" entered in the Circuit Court of the First
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1
Circuit (circuit court ) in favor of Defendant/Cross-Claim 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Plaintiff/Appellee Bank of Hawai 'i (BOH). 
On appeal, Robert appears to contend that the circuit

 
court erred in granting BOH's motion for summary judgment (MSJ)
 
for a decree of foreclosure because Plaintiff/Counterclaim
 
Defendant/Appellee Waianae Community Development Project
 Association (WCDPA) and BOH engaged in conduct rendering the
 
summary judgment inappropriate.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 Robert's appeal is without merit.
 
Robert's opening brief is not in compliance with the 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) because, 
inter alia, it does not include citations to the parts of the record relied on (HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)). Noncompliance with the HRAP may provide grounds for dismissal. HRAP Rule 30 (providing that when an appellant's brief is "not in conformity with [the HRAP], the appeal may be dismissed"). Although Robert's failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b) has hindered our review, we decline to dismiss his appeal and instead resolve this appeal on the merits because Robert is proceeding pro se and the answering briefs filed by WCDPA and BOH assisted this court in assessing the facts, procedural history, and issues apparently raised by Robert. See Hous. Fin. and Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai
'i 
81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999) (excusing the appellant's noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28(b) on the grounds that the Hawai
'i Supreme Court "has consistently adhered to the 
policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible"). 
A foreclosure decree is warranted only when the party
 
seeking foreclosure established: (1) that the parties entered an
 agreement, (2) the terms of the agreement, (3) that default

occurred as defined by the agreement, and (4) that notice of
 
default was given in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 
See Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654
 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982).
 
In support of its July 16, 2012 MSJ, BOH attached
 
certified copies of the: (1) January 23, 2006 Note by which
 Robert's wife promised to pay BOH $130,000 plus interest in
 return for the loan she received from BOH; (2) January 23, 2006
 recorded Mortgage that Robert and his wife (the Quarteros)
 
executed with BOH that secured payment on the Note by encumbering
 
the Quarteros' parcel of real property within the WCDPA community
 (Property); (3) loan history; (4) September 8, 2011 "Thirty Day
 
Notice of Default" letter (Notice of Default) that notified the
 
Quarteros that they defaulted on the Note and Mortgage, that BOH
 
was electing to exercise its right to accelerate the loan, and
 that BOH may pursue foreclosure of the Property if it did not
 receive payment in full by October 8, 2011; and (5) a Declaration
 of Indebtedness by a custodian of BOH's relevant business records
 that addressed the Note, Mortgage, loan history, Notice of
 Default, and balance due to BOH.
 
Therefore, BOH did establish the four factors set forth
 
by Anderson. BOH established the existence of the Note and the
 Mortgage, the terms of the agreements, that the Quarteros
 defaulted under the terms of the Note and the Mortgage, and that
 BOH provided the Quarteros with proper notice of the Quarteros'
 default and BOH's intent to accelerate the loan and pursue
 foreclosure if the default was not timely cured. In light of the
 above established facts, and the fact that Robert failed to
 establish that there were any genuine issues of material fact to
 preclude summary judgment, the circuit court properly granted
 BOH's motion for summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure and
 therefore Robert's appeal is without merit. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 21, 2012
 
"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting Bank of
 Hawaii's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Parties and For
