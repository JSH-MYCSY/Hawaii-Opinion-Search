 for (a) Reconsideration of the Court's December 26, 2012 Order
 Regarding Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment Filed on July

 as to Count I of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, Filed on

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Agard's
 appeal as follows:
 
(1) Agard cites no authority to support her
 
contentions regarding the alleged-contradiction between
 conveyance of the Promissory Note (Note) to Deutsche Bank under
 
the Trust and the Second Assignment of the mortgage interest from
 
FDIC to Deutsche Bank on June 10, 2010. "[A]s a matter of common
 law, the mortgage was automatically transferred with the
 underlying note." In re Wright, 2012 WL 27500, at *3 (Bankr. D.
 
Haw. Jan. 5, 2012), reconsideration denied 2012 WL 260744 (Bankr.
 D. Haw. Jan. 27, 2012) (citing In re Veal, 450 B.R. 897, 916
 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2011); Carpenter v. Longan, 83 U.S. 271, 274–75
 (1872) and Restatement (Third) of Property (Mortgage) § 5.4
 (1997)). As soon as Deutsche Bank became entitled to enforce the
 Note, Deutsche Bank succeeded to the mortgagee's interest. Agard
 did not argue to the circuit court that Deutsche Bank was not the
 holder of the Note, nor does she challenge the validity of the
 Trust. Agard's contention that Deutsche Bank obtained the Note
 on October 31, 2006 and was later assigned the mortgage interest
 on June 10, 2010 does not raise a genuine issue of material fact
 as to whether Deutsche Bank was entitled to foreclose on the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
property. Additionally, there is no genuine issue of material
 
fact to support Agard's claim that Deutsche Bank participated in
 a "fradulent" transaction in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 480-2 (2008 Repl.), unfair and deceptive acts or
 
practices (UDAP).
 
Agard fails to support her contention that OneWest's 
failure to identify its principal when it "claimed ownership" in 
its proof of claim case before the bankruptcy court raised a genuine issue of material fact. Agard does not indicate whether and where in the record she raised the issue of OneWest's authority to file a proof of claim to the circuit court so as to preserve this argument for appeal. We therefore decline to address it on appeal. See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7). 
(2)(a) Agard's remaining contentions concern alleged 
irregularities with Defendants' foreclosure process that, according to Agard, "constitute viable UDAP claims in Count 1, [First Amended Complaint]." A UDAP committed "in the conduct of any trade or commerce [is] unlawful." HRS § 480–2(a). A contract or agreement in violation of HRS Chapter 480 is void and unenforceable. See HRS § 480–12. Agard's mortgage and loan 
transaction fell "within the ambit of HRS [Chapter] 480, inasmuch as (1) a loan extended by a financial institution is activity involving conduct of any trade and commerce and (2) loan borrowers are consumers within the meaning of HRS § 480–1 [(2008 Repl.)]." Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai
'i 
213, 227, 11 P.3d 1, 15 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); Am. Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v. Riddel, No. CAAP-11-0000559 (App. June 27, 2014) (mem). 
To support her UDAP claim under HRS § 480-12, Agard was 
required to allege: (1) a violation of HRS Chapter 480 or specific types of violations of HRS Chapter 667; (2) injury to plaintiff's business or property resulting from such violation; and (3) proof of the amount of damages. See Hawaii Med. Ass'n v. 
Hawaii Med. Serv. Ass'n, Inc., 113 Hawai
'i 77, 113-14, 148 P.3d 
1179, 1215–16 (2006); Lizza, 1 F. Supp. 3d 1106 at *13.

An injury resulting from a UDAP must be "fairly 
traceable to the defendant's actions." Flores v. Rawlings Co., 
LLC, 117 Hawai 'i 153, 167 n.23, 177 P.3d 341, 355 n.23 (2008) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Hawai 'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure Rule 9(b) requires all averments of fraud or 
mistake to set forth circumstances constituting fraud or mistake with particularity. "The rule is designed, in part, to insure the particularized information necessary for a defendant to prepare an effective defense to a claim which embraces a wide variety of potential conduct." Larsen v. Pacesetter Sys., Inc., 
74 Haw. 1, 30, 837 P.2d 1273, 1288 (1992), amended on reh'g in part, 74 Haw. 650, 843 P.2d 144 (1992) (citation omitted). General allegations are insufficient, "[a] plaintiff must state the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake with particularity (e.g., allege who made the false representations) and specify the representations made." Larsen, 74 Haw. at 30-31, 
837 P.2d at 1288 (citing Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 59, 451 P.2d 814, 823 (1969)). 
(2)(b) The circuit court found Agard's assertions
 
regarding the "robo-sign[ature]" of Erica Johnson-Seck (Johnson-
Seck), a OneWest employee, did not overcome Defendants' summary
 
judgment motion because she offered no evidence that the Second
 
Assignment "was signed by a person without authority to act or
 without knowledge of the contents of the [a]ssignment . . . ." 
Del Piano v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., 2012 WL
 621975, at *10 (D. Haw. 2012). Agard's evidence that Johnson-
Seck testified in an unrelated Florida case that she signed a
 significant percentage of documents without reading them did not
 establish that Johnson-Seck, the signatory to the Second
 Assignment, had not read the Second Assignment in the instant
 case.
 Agard's contention that Johnson-Seck lacked authority
 
to execute the Second Assignment dated June 10, 2010 and recorded
 June 18, 2010, was based on an earlier Limited Power of Attorney
 (POA), recorded on September 4, 2009 and in effect up to March
 
19, 2010, thus had no bearing on whether Johnson-Seck was
 
authorized to do so under a subsequent POA. OneWest's attorney
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declared Johnson-Seck had executed the Second Assignment with
 
authority to do so pursuant to the POA effective from March 20,
 2009 through June 19, 2010. Agard cites no authority for her
 contention that the POA was ineffective absent a corporate seal
 or a statement revoking an earlier POA.
 
Agard's belated attempts to introduce expert testimony 
that Johnson-Seck's signature was a forgery were not erroneously rejected because Agard did not establish why this "new evidence and/or arguments . . . could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea 
Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 
608, 621 (2002). 
(2)(c) Agard contends OneWest committed UDAPs by:
 
negotiating in bad faith on her loan modification; reneging on a
 granting of a loan modification and forcing a forbearance plan on
 Agard; misrepresenting that Agard had failed to make payments;
 misapplying Agard's payments and proceeding to publish a Notice
 of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale
 (Notice); "wrongfully us[ing] its own errors to justify its
 
excuse to publish [the Notice]"; instructing Agard not to pay her
 
August 2009 balloon payment, "admitt[ing] that its representative
 should never have given [Agard] such an instruction" and
 informing Agard that she was no longer eligible for any payment
 plan because she had failed to make required payments on her loan
 modification plan.
 
Agard's First Amended Complaint alleged with sufficient
 
particularity Defendants' acts in 2009 regarding her loan
 modification and forbearance plan constituted a UDAP by reason of
 fraud. Agard submitted moneygram receipts and a declaration
 attesting to alleged instructions by Indymac to refrain from
 paying her final August balloon payment and that OneWest
 "admitted" it had misapplied her February and March 2009
 payments. OneWest's attorney declared that in August 2009, Agard
 contacted OneWest and advised them that "she was unable to make
 the balloon payment due under the terms of the [March 12, 2009]
 Forbearance letter." OneWest advised her "there was nothing
 further OneWest could offer her at that time." OneWest's
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorney further declared, based on his review of records,
 
Agard's payments had been partly applied to her forbearance plan
 and the remaining amount was returned to her because the amount
 remitted did not represent the total amount due at that time.
 
Seen in a light most favorable to Agard, OneWest 
attorney's declaration did not refute Agard's claims that a OneWest agent instructed her to not-pay the August 2009 payment and to call back at the end of the month, and that OneWest had "admitted" to having misapplied her payments to other accounts. Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai
'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 
(2005). Viewing the evidence in this favorable light, we conclude Defendants did not rebut Agard's allegation that Defendants' agent instructed Agard to refrain from remitting the August 2009 payment and call back later, nor that her misreliance on Defendants' instruction resulted in her loss of interests in the property. Agard's allegations that Defendants instructed her to not-pay her August 2009 payment and then used her non-payment as a basis to rescind the March 12, 2009 forbearance plan raised a genuine issue of material fact that rendered summary judgment for Defendants on Agard's UDAP claims in regard to OneWest's actions improper.
