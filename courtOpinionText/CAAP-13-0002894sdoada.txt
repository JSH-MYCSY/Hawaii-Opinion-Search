JAYSON AULD, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-0690(3))

(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's (State) motion for
 
imposition of a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment, Auld
 must serve a minimum of six (6) years and eight (8) months under
 
3
HRS § 706-606.5(1)(b)(iii) (2014)  as a repeat offender. 
Auld contends the circuit court (1) violated his
 
constitutional rights by granting the State's motion for a
 mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, (2) improperly admitted
 hearsay, and (3) failed to admonish the State for making an
 argument during its opening statement. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Auld's
 points of error as follows and affirm.
 
Auld did not raise his constitutional argument before 
the circuit court and did not object to the other alleged errors during trial. His arguments on appeal are thus based on alleged plain error by the circuit court. See HRS § 641-2 (Supp. 2014); 
HRS § 641-16 (1993); State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai
'i 327, 334, 141 
P.3d 974, 981 (2006). 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 52(b) states that 
"[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be

§706-606.5 Sentencing of repeat offenders.
(1) Nothwithstanding section 706-669 and any other law to
the contrary, any person convicted of murder in the second
degree, any class A felony, any class B felony, or any of
the following class C felonies[,] . . . and who has a prior
conviction or prior convictions for the following
felonies . . . , shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum
period of imprisonment without possibility of parole during
such period as follows:

(b) Two prior felony convictions:

noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the 
court." Therefore, an appellate court "may recognize plain error when the error committed affects substantial rights of the defendant." State v. Staley, 91 Hawai
'i 275, 282, 982 P.2d 904, 
911 (1999) (citation and internal quotation mark omitted). 
The appellate court "will apply the plain error 
standard of review to correct errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights[.]" Nichols, 111 Hawai
'i at 334, 
141 P.3d at 981 (quoting State v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai 'i 325, 330, 
966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998)) (block quote format omitted). An appellate court's "power to deal with plain error is one to be exercised sparingly and with caution because the plain error rule represents a departure from a presupposition of the adversary system--that a party must look to his or her counsel for protection and bear the cost of counsel's mistakes." Nichols, 
111 Hawai
'i at 335, 141 P.3d at 982 (quoting State v. Kelekolio, 
74 Haw. 479, 515, 849 P.2d 58, 74-75 (1993)) (block quote format omitted). 
1. Sentence  The circuit court did not err in its
 
imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence. Auld contends his
 federal and state constitutional rights to a trial by jury and
 due process were violated.
 
Auld contends that under Alleyne v. United States, __
 
U.S. __, 133 S.Ct. 2151 (2013), "any fact that increases the
 mandatory minimum is an 'element' that must be submitted to the
 jury." Id. at __, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. However, the Alleyne court
 
expressly noted that its decision did not disturb its earlier
 holding in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 246­47 (1998), that a prior conviction is not an element of a crime,
 and does not have to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable
 doubt. __ U.S. at __, 133 S.Ct. at 2160 n.1; see Apprendi v. New
 Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000) ("Other than the fact of a prior
 conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
crime . . . must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt." (emphasis added)); United States v. Harris, 741 F.3d 1245, 1249-50 (11th Cir. 2014) (noting the continued vitality of Almendarez-Torres). Further, the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court has expressly recognized an exception for prior convictions from the requirement that a sentence enhancement must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the trier of fact. State v. 
Maugaotega, 115 Hawai
'i 432, 446-47 & n.15, 168 P.3d 562, 576-77 
& n.15 (2007) ("The United States Supreme Court has always exempted prior convictions from the Apprendi rule[.] . . . The Court bases the exception on the fact that prior convictions have themselves been subject to the sixth amendment right to a jury trial and the accompanying requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."); State v. Keohokapu, 127 Hawai
'i 91, 108, 276 
P.3d 660, 677 (2012). Thus, Auld's argument under Alleyne is without merit. 
Auld also contends that his due process rights have 
been violated. However, in State v. Jess, 117 Hawai
'i 381, 184 
P.3d 133 (2008), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court cited favorably to the 
federal standard that prior convictions are an exception to the mandate to include sentence enhancements in the charging instrument. Id. at 397-98, 184 P.3d at 149-50. We note that in 
State v. Freitas, 61 Haw. 262, 602 P.2d 914 (1979), the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court expressly noted that "[w]hile due process does not require that notice be given prior to the trial of the underlying offense, it does require that a defendant to be sentenced under [HRS § 706-606.5] be given reasonable notice and afforded the opportunity to be heard." Id. at 277, 602 P.2d at 925. Here, 
Auld filed an opposition to the State's motion for imposition of the mandatory minimum, was represented by counsel who presented argument at the hearing on the State's motion, and did not object to the circuit court's reception into evidence of the sealed and certified judgments from Auld's two prior felony convictions and judicial notice of the records in both prior convictions. Thus, Auld's due process rights were not violated.

2. Hearsay  Auld contends the following testimony from
 
the complaining witness (CW) was hearsay:
 
Then one of the owners told me, "That's my pool stick.
Where did you get that?"
He told me, "You stole my pool stick."
 
The circuit court did not commit plain error by failing to sua
 
sponte strike this testimony.
 
It does not appear this testimony was admitted for the
 
truth of the matter asserted. The CW's testimony was proffered
 in response to the State's inquiry about whether he took
 possession of the stick upon the sale. Further, the testimony
 only explains why the CW no longer had possession of the stick
 and did not want to pay the remainder of the purchase price to
 Auld. Lastly, we note that Auld himself testified that the CW
 did not want to pay him because the CW thought the stick was
 stolen.

Even assuming the statement was hearsay, there is no 
error, let alone plain error, because when there is no objection to the testimony, it's unclear if there were reasons for defense counsel not to object. See State v. Fields, 120 Hawai
'i 73, 92­
93, 201 P.3d 586, 605-06 (App. 2005), aff'd on other grounds 115 Hawai
'i 503, 168 P.3d 955 (2007). 
Thus, Auld's hearsay argument lacks merit.
3. Opening Statement  The circuit court did not
 
plainly err in failing to admonish the State for improper opening
 remarks. Auld contends the State's first words were improper:
 "This case is about the young and strong taking advantage of the
 
4 Auld testified in pertinent part that
 
We pulled up and I got out and started talking to [the
CW]. He hand me–-I ask for my money. He hand me $30. I count
them and never have the other ten.
 
So I told him, "Where's the rest of the money?"
He said, "I'm not going to pay anymore because the
pool stick was stolen."
I told him, "We had an agreement. You got a pay." And
then we kept talking, kept talking.
Then he pushed me in a manner that I never thought he
never had the right to do. You know what I mean?

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
weaker and the older. It's about the young and the strong
 
overpowering the weaker and the stronger [sic]." This was the
 only time the State made this assertion, and Auld did not object
 to this statement at trial. On appeal, Auld argues that this
 argument amounts to prosecutorial misconduct due to the integral
 place that opening statements hold in a trial. 
Because Auld did not object to the State's opening 
comment, "we must determine whether the prosecutor's comment was improper and, if so, whether such misconduct constituted plain error that affected [Auld's] substantial rights." State v. 
Clark, 83 Hawai
'i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996). 
"Prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial or the setting aside of a guilty verdict only where the actions of the prosecutor have caused prejudice to the defendant's right to a fair trial." State v. McGriff, 76 Hawai
'i 148, 158, 871 P.2d 
782, 792 (1994); State v. Marsh, 68 Haw. 659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1303 (1986). 
"This court evaluates claims of improper statements by 
prosecutors by first determining whether the statements are improper, and then determining whether the misconduct is harmless." State v. Tuua, 125 Hawai
'i 10, 14, 250 P.3d 273, 277 
(2011). 
An opening statement merely provides an opportunity
for counsel to advise an outline for the jury, the facts and
questions in the matter before them. Hence, the purpose of
an opening statement is to explain the case to the jury and
to outline the proof. It is not an occasion for argument.
Ordinarily, the scope and extent of the opening
statement is left to the sound discretion of the trial
 judge. However, the trial court should exclude irrelevant
facts and stop argument if it occurs. The State should only
refer in the opening statement to evidence that it has a
genuine good-faith belief will be produced at trial. If
 improper remarks are made during the opening statement, the
test for determining the existence of prosecutorial
misconduct in the opening statement is whether the improper
remarks prejudicially affected the defendant's substantive
rights.

1996) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).

"The prosecutor's opening statement in a criminal trial 
should contain a capsulized version of the evidence that the 
prosecutor expects to present and the claim that the prosecutor will make with reference to the evidence." 75 Am. Jur. 2d Trial § 432 (2007). Therefore, counsel is permitted to state their theory of the case. See State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai
'i 474, 480, 
122 P.3d 254, 260 (2005) (noting that defense presented its theories of the case during opening statement). 
Upon reviewing the entirety of the State's opening 
statement, the State provided the jury with a description of the CW's physical appearance and an outline of the CW's expected testimony. Evidence was adduced at trial to support these statements. Counsel "outline[d] for the jury the facts and questions in the matter before them," and explained the case. Sanchez, 82 Hawai
'i at 528, 923 P.2d at 945. That is the purpose 
of the opening statement. Id. In light of the mandate that 
appellate courts find plain error sparingly and with caution, Auld has not demonstrated that the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings have been substantially affected. 
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment
 
Conviction and Sentence filed August 1, 2013, in the Circuit
 Court of Second Circuit is affirmed.
