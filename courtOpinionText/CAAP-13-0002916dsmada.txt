MICHAEL S. GIBSON, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
KATHRYN K. WIESE, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-M NO. 09-1-0013)
 
ORDER
 
(1)
 DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT’S
SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO FILE APPEAL;
(2) DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 24(c);
AND
 
(3)
 ALL OTHER PENDING MOTIONS ARE DENIED AS MOOT
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the “Motion to Extend Time to
 
File Appeal,” filed September 17, 2013, by Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Michael S. Gibson (Appellant), pro se, the “Affidavit in Support
 of Motion for Leave to Proceed on Appeal In Forma Pauperis,
 Amended,” filed September 18, 2013, by Appellant, which the court
 
construes as a second motion for leave to proceed on appeal in
 forma pauperis, and the record, it appears that,
 
(1)
 Appellant filed a notice of appeal on August 20,
 
2013; 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) To the extent Appellant seeks an extension of time
 
to file a notice of appeal in this appellate court case, the
 
request is moot;
 
(3) To the extent Appellant seeks an extension of time 
to file another notice of appeal from the same underling family court proceedings, FC-M No. 09-1-0013, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(4) requires requests for extensions of time to file a notice of appeal to be filed in the court or agency appealed from; 
(4) On September 4, 2013, the court denied without
 
prejudice Appellant’s request to proceed on appeal in forma
 pauperis, and ordered Appellant to pay the required filing fee,
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 24(c), within ten days from the date of the
 order, or the appeal could be dismissed; 
(5) Appellant did not file a motion for reconsideration
 
of the September 4, 2013 order; 
(6) Appellant’s second motion for leave to proceed on
 
appeal in forma pauperis, filed September 18, 2013, appears to
 restate the grounds stated in the aforementioned initial request
 except that the first motion indicated that Appellant had $7,000
 in cash, checking or savings accounts, whereas the second motion
 indicates that Appellant has about $500 in both accounts, but
 does not explain when, how, or why those funds depleted so
 quickly, and therefore does not establish good cause.
 
(7) Even if the September 18, 2013 second motion for
 
leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is construed as a
 motion for reconsideration, which it is not, it is untimely, as a
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
motion for reconsideration of the September 4, 2013 order would
 
have been due by September 16, 2013. See HRAP Rule 26(c) &
 
40(a); and
 
(8) In any event, the filing and docketing fees have
 
not been paid. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the September 17, 2013 motion
 
for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal is denied
 without prejudice to any relief that might be available in the
 underlying family court case, FC-M No. 09-1-0013.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed for
 
failure to pay the filing docketing fee. All other pending
 motions are denied as moot.
