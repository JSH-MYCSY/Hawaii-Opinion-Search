Professional Security Consultants, Inc. (together, PSC)  for
PSC's alleged tortious interference with Alii's contractual 
relationship and tortious interference with Alii's prospective business advantage with the Department of Transportation, State of Hawai
'i (DOT). PSC moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing 
that Alii failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that the claims were statutorily barred. The circuit court granted the motion. On appeal, Alii seeks to have the Order vacated and the Judgment set aside.
I.
 BACKGROUND
 
In July of 2008, the DOT awarded Alii a three-year
 
contract to provide security services in Oahu's commercial
 harbors. The contract term commenced in September of 2008,
 terminated in September of 2011, but provided for two optional
 one-year extensions. In late 2010, Alii met with DOT Operations
 Supervisor Bill Davis (Davis) to discuss the manner of exercising
 
the option for the first one-year extension. In this meeting,
 
Davis allegedly told Alii that the contract required Alii to
 write a letter to the DOT district manager seeking written
 confirmation of the extension. Davis allegedly stated that he
 expected "the extension would be routinely granted because of
 Alii['s] satisfactory performance." Alii thereafter sent a
 letter to DOT documenting the "agreement" to extend the contract
 and requesting "confirmation of the extension."
 
In a June 22, 2011 meeting, DOT informed Alii that
 
instead of being renewed, the contract would go out for bid
 because of "material changes
[3] and a significant increase in the
 
scope of the contract." DOT thereafter offered to extend the
 contract with Alii for a 6 to 9 month period while the new
 contract was being assembled, and Alii agreed. The contract was

 "Professional Security Consultants, Inc." and "Professional
Security Consultants" are separately registered entities sharing corporate
officers. According to PSC, Professional Security Consultants is the trade
name under which Professional Security Consultants, Inc. conducts business.

 According to Alii, the changes included, inter alia, the addition
of a third class of security guard, the removal of reference to Kewalo Basin
as one of the commercial harbor facilities covered by the contract, the
addition of 33 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) § 105 certification, and
the removal of a background check requirement for security guards.

set to terminate around April 2012. On or about July 25, 2011,
 
DOT issued its request for proposals for the new Harbors
 Contract. The contract was to be awarded to "the lowest
 responsive and responsible bidder whose proposal complies with
 all the prescribed requirements." Alii and PSC were two of
 thirteen bidders. The contract was awarded to PSC on November 1,
 2011.
4 Alii was the second-lowest bidder.
 
On November 30, 2011, Alii filed a formal bid protest
 
with the director of DOT challenging the award pursuant to Hawaii
 
5
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 103D-701 (2012 Repl.).  The protest was
 
denied as untimely and lacking sufficient content. Alii
 requested a hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings of
 the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (
DCCA) to contest
 
the denial of its protest. The hearings officer affirmed the
 denial in its February 24, 2012, "Findings of Fact, Conclusions
 of Law, and Decision" (FOFs/COLs and Decision). Alii appealed
 
6
the FOFs/COLs and Decision to the circuit court,  which affirmed
the hearings officer's denial on the grounds of inadequate
 contents of the protest. Alii then appealed the circuit court's

 
decision to this court, which affirmed the circuit court
 decision. See Alii Sec. Sys., Inc., v. Dep't. of Transp., No.
 
CAAP-12-0000790 (App. Feb. 13, 2014) (mem).

A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Alii filed the present action on February 14, 2012,
 
alleging three counts against PSC: Count I, Tortious Interference
 
7
; Count II, Tortious
 with Contractual Relations (TICR) 
4
 Although the contract award was made on November 1, 2011, the
contract term does not commence until the date indicated on the Notice to
 
Proceed issued by the State.
5
 HRS § 103D-701 provides in relevant part: "[a]ny actual or
prospective bidder, offeror, or contractor who is aggrieved in connection with
the solicitation or award of a contract may protest to the chief procurement
officer or a designee as specified in the solicitation."
 
6
 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.
 
7
 Under Hawai' i law, the elements of a TICR claim are: 
(1) a contract between the plaintiff and a third party; (2)
the defendant's knowledge of the contract; (3) the
defendant's intentional inducement of the third party to
breach the contract; (4) the absence of justification on
(continued...)

; and
 Interference with Prospective Business Advantage (TIPBA) 
Count III, punitive damages.9 Alii alleged that PSC 
disrupted [Alii's] existing contractual relationship and its
prospective business advantage with the DOT by, inter alia,
knowingly misrepresenting possessing necessary
qualifications, making materially false statements to the
DOT, making materially false statements to the [DCCA],
falsely representing the capability to perform the
requirements of the successor contract, falsely,
representing being a business entity licensed to transact
business in Hawaii, providing false Hawaii principal office
addresses, inducing the DOT to terminate its Contract with
[Alii], and inducing the DOT to award the successor contract
to [PSC].
 
As to Count I, Alii alleged that the three-year
 
security contract created a contractual relationship between Alii
 
and DOT, that PSC had knowledge of the contract, that PSC
 intentionally induced DOT to breach the contract, that there was
 no justification for PSC's actions, that DOT breached the
 contract, and that Alii suffered resulting damages.
 
As to Count II, Alii alleged that it had a "business
 
relationship and/or prospective advantage or expectancy" with DOT
 "which was sufficiently definite, specific, and capable in the
 sense that at all material times there was a reasonable
 probability of it maturing into a contract" providing "future
 economic benefit" to Alii, that PSC had knowledge of the
 expectancy, that PSC intentionally interfered with the
 
7(...continued)
defendant's part; (5) the subsequent breach of the contract
by the third party; and (6) damages to the plaintiff.
 
Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai' i 19, 32, 936 P.3d 655, 668 (1997) (quoting Weinberg v. 
Mauch, 78 Hawai' i 40, 50, 890 P.2d 277, 287 (1995)). 
8
 Under Hawai' i law, the elements of a TIPBA claim are: 
(1) a prospective contractual relationship existed between
the plaintiff and a third party; (2) the defendant knew of
this relationship; (3) the defendant intentionally
interfered with the plaintiff's prospective contract; (4)
the defendant acted without proper justification; (5) the
defendant's interference caused the third party to fail to
consummate the prospective contract with the plaintiff; and
(6) the defendant's interference caused damages to the
plaintiff.

 The circuit court recognized that Count III is not a separate
cause of action and did not treat it as so.

expectancy, that the impairment of the expectancy was the legal
 
and proximate result of the interference by PSC, and that Alii
 suffered resulting damages.
 
On August 21, 2012, PSC filed a motion to dismiss the 
complaint under Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
12(b)(6), or in the alternative, for summary judgment under HRCP 
10
Rule 56 (Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment).  PSC
 
contended that Count I "fail[ed] to allege fact [sic] sufficient
 to establish two of the necessary elements of the claim for
 tortious interference with contract[ual relations]," and that
 both Counts I and II are barred by the exclusivity provisions of
 HRS § 103D-704 (2012 Repl.) (the Exclusive Remedy Provision). 
PSC attached several documents and exhibits in support of its
 Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment. In a September 14,
 2012 reply memorandum in support of the Motion to Dismiss or for
 Summary Judgment, PSC subsequently withdrew the HRCP Rule 56
 motion for summary judgment portion, stating that "it is
 unnecessary for the court to consider matters outside of the
 pleadings in order to confirm that the Complaint fails to state a
 claim upon which relief can be granted and should be dismissed"
 under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6). In the reply memorandum, PSC limited
 the basis of the HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) portion of the Motion to
 Dismiss or for Summary Judgment to two arguments: (1) that Alii
 failed to state a valid TICR claim because "the nonrenewal of
 [Alii's] prior contract does not constitute a breach of contract"
 and (2) that the TIPBA claim was barred by the exclusive remedy
 provisions of HRS § 103D-704. After a September 20, 2012 hearing
 on PCS's Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment, the circuit
 court issued the Order granting the motion to dismiss and held:
 
The Court having reviewed all memoranda, declarations
and affidavits, and exhibits submitted thereto, having heard
and considered the arguments of counsel, being fully
apprised of the circumstances of the case and having viewed
the record and construing the allegations of the Complaint
in the light most favorable to [Alii], finds and declares as
follows:
 
10
 PSC also raised the defenses of claim preclusion and issue
preclusion in its motion, however, these issues were not addressed by the
court in its Order.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff's Motion[11] is granted as to Count I of the
Complaint on the ground that the Complaint fails to allege
the necessary facts to sustain a cause of action for [TICR].
 
Plaintiff's Motion [(See n.11)] is granted as to Count
II of the Complaint because [Alii's] claim for damages
relating to a solicitation or award is barred by the
exclusivity provisions of Section 103D-704 of the [HRS].
 
. . . .
 
HRS § 103D-101[(b)] provides that, "Any actual or
prospective bidder, offeror, (contractor), or business
taking part in the conduct of public procurement, shall act
in good faith to practice purchasing ethics[.]"
 
Furthermore, HRS § 103D-704 provides, "The procedures
and remedies provided for in this part, and the rules
adopted by the [p]olicy [b]oard, shall be the exclusive
means available for persons aggrieved in connection with the
solicitation or award of a contract, a suspension or
debarment proceeding, or in connection with a contract
controversy, to resolve their claims or differences[.]"
 
The Court determines that HRS § 103D imposes duties
not only on government officials but also any prospective
bidder. Because [Alii's] Complaint seeks relief in
connection with the solicitation of the award of .a
 contract, [Alii's] exclusive means of remedy are governed by
HRS § 103D. As such, [Alii's] claims for damages are barred
by the exclusivity provisions of HRS § 103D—704.
 
12
Alii filed this timely appeal  on August 21, 2013.
B. POINTS OF ERROR ON APPEAL
 
On appeal, Alii contends the circuit court committed
 
(1) reversible error in treating PSC's motion as an
 
HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim
 upon which relief can be granted rather than as an HRCP Rule 56
 motion for summary judgment;
13
 
(2) reversible error in concluding that Alii's claims
 
11
 The circuit court's Order entered on October 24, 2012, dismisses
all of Alii's claims with prejudice. The language of the order mistakenly
describes PSC's motion as "Plaintiff's Motion" rather than "Defendant's
 Motion," but the circuit court's error is harmless because the error was
obviously typographical and the circuit court's analysis otherwise clearly
supports dismissal of Alii's claims. See HRCP Rule 61 ("The court at every
stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding
which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.").
 
12
 The original Final Judgment was filed on February 20, 2013, which
Alii appealed on March 21, 2013. However, the appeal was dismissed for lackof jurisdiction under Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright), 76 Hawai' i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). A second Final Judgment was accordinglyentered on July 24, 20l3. 
13
 For reasons that will become clear in this opinion, we need not
address this point on appeal.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were barred by the Exclusive Remedy Provision of the Procurement
 
Code; and
 
(3) reversible error in dismissing Alii's TICR claim
 
for failure to allege the necessay facts to sustain a cause of

 
action.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW

 
A trial court's ruling on [an HRCP Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to
dismiss is reviewed de novo. The court must accept
plaintiff's allegations as true and view them in the light
most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if
it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set
of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle
him or her to relief.

Valley Ass'n v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai 'i 90, 96, 194 
P.3d 531, 537 (2008).
 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non—moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.

 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The circuit court erred in concluding that Alii's claim for
tortious interference with prospective business advantage
was barred by the Exclusive Remedy Provision of HRS § 103D­704
 
Alii contends the circuit court erred when it dismissed
 
Count II (TIPBA) as barred by the Exclusive Remedy Provision
 
found in HRS § 103D-704. Alii argues that the "exclusivity"
 provision only precludes civil actions for damages against a
 government agency.
 
Statutory construction is guided by the following
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
principles:
 
[When construing a statute,] our foremost obligation
is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. And we must read
 statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a
statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
. . . Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic
aids in determining legislative intent. One avenue is the
 use of legislative history as an interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning.
 
Kapuwai v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai 'i 304, 308, 196 
P.3d 306, 311 (App. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds by
 
Kapuwai v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 121 Hawai 'i 33, 211 P.3d 750 
(2009) (quoting Lingle v. Hawaii Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152,
 107 Hawai
'i 178, 183 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005)). 
HRS chapter 103D is the Hawai 'i Public Procurement Code 
(Procurement Code). Part VII of the Procurement Code describes
 
the proper administrative remedies for challenging government
 
contract awards. HRS §§ 103D-701 to 103D—7l3. The Exclusive
 Remedy Provision holds, in relevant part:
 
§103D-704 Exclusivity of remedies. The procedures
and remedies provided for in this part, and the rules
adopted by the policy board, shall be the exclusive means
available for persons aggrieved in connection with the
solicitation or award of a contract, a suspension or
debarment proceeding, or in connection with a contract
controversy, to resolve their claims or differences.
 
The issue presented by this case is whether the
 
statutory language bars civil actions.14
 
HRS § 103D-704 does not expressly preclude civil
 
actions. Disputes over solicitations and awards fall under HRS
 
14
 The legislature has expressly stated that circuit courts have,
subject matter jurisdiction over all "civil actions and proceedings" and "itis presumed that the courts have jurisdiction, unless the legislature"expressly" provides otherwise by statute." Alakai Na Keiki, Inc. v.Matayoshi, 127 Hawai' i 263, 279, 277 P.3d 988, 1004 (2012) (emphasis added)
(citing HRS § 603—21.5). The Hawai' i Supreme Court has also held that "[a]
statutory remedy is, as a rule, merely cumulative and does not abolish anexiting common law remedy unless so declared in express terms or by necessaryimplication." Watson v. Brown, 67 Haw. 252, 256, 686 P.2d 12, 15 (1984)
(emphasis added). 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 103D—701, which provides a method for bidders to challenge an
 
agency's processes and decisions. Suspension and debarment
 proceedings fall under HRS § 103D—702 (2012 Repl.), which allow
 an agency to remove a person from consideration of future awards.
 Contract controversies fall under HRS § 103D—703 (2012 Repl.),
 but is specific to controversies "between a governmental body and
 a contractor." A private tort claim between competing bidders
 does not fit into any of those categories, and it does not appear
 that the statutory protest proceedings provide an adequate means
 of resolving claims between competing bidders or that the chief
 procuring officer would even have jurisdiction to hear such a
 claim at all. See HRS § 103D—701(a).
 
Part VII of the Procurement Code addresses the
 
authority and responsibilities of the contracting agency,
 provides the procedures for reviewing challenges to the award and
 solicitation processes, and prescribes the remedies for the
 resolution of such challenges. It does not address the
 resolution of claims or injuries arising between competing
 bidders. The legislature included a statement of intent in
 adopting the original Procurement Code:
 
SECTION 1. The legislature finds that there is a need
to improve and update the State's laws relating to
government procurement.
 
. . . .
 
The purpose of this Act is to promote economy,
efficiency, and effectiveness in the procurement of goods
and services, and the construction of public works for the
State and counties, by:
 
(1)	 Simplifying, clarifying, and modernizing the law
governing procurement;
 
(2)	 Requiring the continued development of
procurement policies and practices;
 
(3)	 Making the procurement laws of the State and
counties as consistent as possible;
 
(4)	 Ensuring the fair and equitable treatment of all
persons who deal with the procurement system of
the State and counties;
 
(5)	 Providing increased economy in procurement
activities and maximizing to the fullest extent
practicable the purchasing value of public
funds;
 
(6)	 Fostering effective broad—based competition
within the free enterprise system;
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(7)	 Providing safeguards for the maintenance of a
procurement system of quality and integrity; and
 
(8)	 Increasing public confidence in the procedures
followed in public procurement.
 
1993 Haw. Sess. Laws, Spec. Sess. Act 8, § 1 at 37—38 (emphasis
 
added). In sum the purpose of the Procurement Code is to address
 the manner in which an agency's bids are requested, received, and
 awarded ensuring the fairness of government conduct and to
 promote "economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the
 procurement of goods and services" by the State and county
 agencies.
 
The legislature's desire for a quick and economic
 
resolution of solicitation and award disputes is reflected in the
 Procurement Code's protest process. 
See HRS § 103D—701(a)
 
(allowing only five working days for the filing of a protest);
 HRS § 103D-701(f) (granting the chief procurement officer
 authority to award the contract without delay, despite a timely
 protest, in order to protect State interests).
 
The overall framework of the Hawai' i Public Procurement code 
indicates that the Legislature intended to create an
expeditious process for resolving disputes over the awardingof contracts. See CARL Corp. v. State, 85 Hawai' i 431, 453,
946 P.2d 1, 24 (1997) ("The [Procurement] Code both shortensdeadlines for filing protests and applications for reviewand expedites the administrative hearings process."). Under most circumstances, public projects cannot proceed while aprotest is pending. See HRS § 103D-709[(g) (2012 Repl.)]
("No action shall be taken on . . . an award of a contractwhile a proceeding is pending[.]" . . . [D]isputes over theaward of contracts will necessarily result in delays thatwill affect public works and . . . the Legislature expresseda clear intent tp expedite the process by which suchdisputes are resolved[.] 
Nihi Lewa, Inc. v. Dep't of Budget and Fiscal Servs., 103 Hawai 'i 
163, l67-68, 80 P.3d 984, 988-89 (2003). 
Construing the Exclusive Remedy Provision to preclude
 
suits between competing bidders would not serve the legislative
 
intent behind the Procurement Code. Precluding suits between
 bidders would not provide "increased economy in procurement
 activities and maximiz[e] to the fullest extent practicable the
 purchasing value of public funds" because the administrative
 agency would not be a party litigant or be accountable to pay
 damages. 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws, Spec. Sess. Act 8, § 1 at 38. 
The efficiency of the procurement process would not be
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hindered because a suit for damages would not delay performance
 
of the contract.
 
Alii does not challenge the award of the contract, but
 
the alleged tortious conduct of its competitor, PSC. Alii made
 this clear when it argued before the circuit court that "[w]e
 haven't contended, nor do we contend . . . that any outcome in
 this case can affect the administration of the DOT's contract
 currently being administered or performed by PSC." Because Alii
 does not seek relief from an agency decision, the Procurement
 Code neither provides a remedy nor bars a remedy for Alii's
 alleged injuries.
 
PSC points to HRS § 103D-101(b) (2012 Repl.), a part of
 
the Procurement Code that imposes ethical duties on bidders, in
 support of its argument that the Procurement Code applies to both
 public entities and to bidders. HRS § 103D-101(b) provides:
 
§103D-101 Requirements of ethical public procurement.
 
. . . .
 (b) Any actual or prospective bidder, offeror,
[contractor], or business taking part in the conduct of
public procurement, shall act in good faith to practice
purchasing ethics, and when applicable, display business
integrity as a responsible offeror through the public
procurement process, including but not limited to the
following:
 
(1)	 Avoiding the intent and appearance of unethical
behavior or business practices;
 
(2)	 Refraining from any activity that would create
the appearance of impropriety or conflicts of
personal interest and the interests of the State
or counties;
 
(3)	 Identifying and eliminating any conflicts of
interest; and
 
(4)	 Ensuring that all persons are afforded an equal
opportunity to compete in a fair and open
environment.
 
However, the duties described are clearly directed at preserving
 
transparency and avoiding the appearance of favoritism, and the
 limited means of enforcement of these duties are insufficient to
 address and resolve the variety of injuries that may occur solely
 between competing bidders. 
The ABA Model Procurement Code has been adopted by
 
seventeen states. Commc'ns-Pac., Inc. v. City & Cty. of
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Honolulu, 121 Hawai 'i 527, 532 n.6, 221 P.3d 505, 510 n.6 (App. 
2009). Of the seventeen states, "Hawai 'i is one of five states 
that added an 'exclusive remedies' provision of some kind." Id. 
The four other states' exclusive remedy provisions have language 
specifying that they apply to actions against the state or procuring agency; none have interpreted their exclusive remedy provisions to preclude suits between competing bidders. See 
Alaska Stat. § 36.30.690 (2009)
15
 ; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§ 41–2615 (2009); Mont. Code Ann. § 18–4–242 (2008); and S.C.
 Code Ann. § 11–35–4210 (2008).

 
The Procurement Code as a whole, taking into account
 
the legislative history and context, suggests that the Exclusive
 Remedy Provision is only intended to limit remedies that a bidder
 can bring against the governmental agency. Therefore, the
 circuit court erred in dismissing Count II.
B.	 The circuit court properly held that Alii failed to
state a claim for TICR upon which relief can be granted
 
Alii claims that the circuit court erred when it
 
dismissed Count I (TICR), arguing that the cause of action was
 
adequately pled in the complaint and that Alii produced
 sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden to overcome the motion
 to dismiss. In its complaint, Alii alleged in Count I that PSC
 "disrupted" Alii's "existing contractual relationship" with DOT. 
PSC moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing, "from the face of
 the Complaint[,] it is clear that DOT did not 'breach' its
 contract with [Alii]" because the contract term had expired, and
 that "DOT's decision not to [renew the contract] cannot be
 characterized as a breach." Granting PSC's motion, the circuit
 court dismissed this Count I "on the ground that the Complaint
 failed to allege the facts necessary to sustain a cause of action
 for [TICR]." Alii argues that "based on the allegations of the
 complaint taken as a whole, the DOT's act of terminating [Alii's]
 contract constituted a breach because it violated its duty of
 good faith and fair dealing . . . ."
 
15
 The Alaska Supreme Court has explicitly held that its exclusive
remedy provision allows private causes of action. See J&S Servs., Inc. v.
Tomter, 139 P.3d 544, 548-49 (Alaska 2006) (permitting tort claims against
individual public officials engaging in deliberate acts of misconduct).

A TICR cause of action requires the plaintiff to prove: 
1) a contract between the plaintiff and a third party; 2)
the defendant's knowledge of the contract; 3) the
defendant's intentional inducement of the third party to
breach the contract; 4) the absence of justification on the
defendant's part; 5) the subsequent breach of the contract
by the third party; and 6) damages to the plaintiff.
 
Meridian Mortg., Inc. v. First Hawaiian Bank, 109 Hawai 'i 35, 45, 
122 P.3d 1133, 1143 (App. 2005), as corrected (Oct. 13, 2005). 
To prevail on a claim of TICR under Hawai 'i law, the "plaintiff 
must show that a breach has occurred . . . . It is quite apparent that under Hawai
'i law a breach is required." Id. at 
44, 122 P.3d at 1142 (first emphasis in original) (declining to follow the Restatement (Second) of Torts – which does not require a breach, but only "non-performance" - as the law of TICR). 
In Hawai
'i, commercial contracts are subject to a 
statutory duty to perform in good faith in their performance and execution. HRS § 490:1-304 (2008 Repl.) ("Every contract or duty within this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement."); See Long v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, Nat'l. Ass'n, 848 F. Supp. 2d 1166, 1180 (D. Haw. 2012). Under the obligation of good faith, "every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will do anything that will deprive the other of the benefits of the agreement." Best Place, Inc. v. Penn. Am. Ins. Co., 82 Hawai
'i 
120, 123-24, 920 P.2d 334, 337–38 (1996). However, "Hawaii law generally does not recognize tort claims for breach of good faith or fair dealing outside the insurance context." See Gold 
Refinery, LLC v. Aloha Island Gold, LLC, 2012 WL 518396 at *7 (D. Haw. Feb. 15, 2012). 
Alii alleges in paragraph five of its complaint that 
its contract with DOT was for three years "with options to extend the contract for one or two additional twelve month periods." As such, until the twelve month extension was agreed upon, any such indications or promises by DOT of an intent to renew the contract for an additional term did not conclude a bargain or form a contract. See Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai
'i 
309, 324, 47 P.3d 1222, 1237 (2002) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 26 at 75 (1981) ("A manifestation of willingness 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it
 
is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making
 it does not intend to conclude a bargain until he has made a
 further manifestation of assent.")). As no contract was formed,
 no breach could occur. The circuit court properly dismissed
 Alli's TICR claim.
