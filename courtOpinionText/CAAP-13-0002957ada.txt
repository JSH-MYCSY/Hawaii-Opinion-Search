OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, C.J.
 
INTRODUCTION

 
I.
 
Defendant-Appellant Lori L. Turping (Turping) appeals
 
her conviction for operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 
intoxicant (OVUII). At 3:00 a.m., the sound of a horn honking
 intermittently drew the attention of police officers to Turping's
 vehicle. The vehicle was stopped, for no apparent reason, in
 middle of the road, approximately 50 to 60 feet before the
 intersection, requiring other vehicles to drive around it. 
Turping was in the driver's seat, with her head slightly tilted
 backward, mouth open, and eyes closed. She appeared to be
 sleeping. Turping's car then began to drift toward the
 intersection at about 5 miles per hour. An officer ran to the
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
vehicle, opened the door, and stepped on the brake. The car came
 
to a stop as it struck the curb.
 
In checking to see whether Turping was okay, the
 
officers noticed an odor of alcohol coming from her vehicle. 
Turping agreed to perform field sobriety tests, but informed the
 officers that she was disabled and under a doctor's care for
 problems with her leg and back. Turping performed poorly on the
 sobriety tests. She swayed from side to side and was unable to
 keep her balance. In addition, Turping's eyes were glassy, she
 smelled of alcohol, and her faced was flushed. The police
 arrested Turping for OVUII.
 
Turping testified that she had "two beers" at a lounge
 
in the early evening before her arrest. According to Turping,
 after helping a friend for several hours, her car overheated as
 she drove home, so she pulled over to rest the engine. While
 waiting, she started to fall asleep. When her car cooled off,
 she resumed driving. Turping admitted, however, that she "fell
 asleep again at . . . the light." Turping acknowledged
 performing poorly on the field sobriety tests but attributed this
 to back and knee injuries. She stated that she needed crutches
 to walk at that time. The District Court of the First Circuit
 (District Court) found Turping guilty of OVUII.

Turping was charged with OVUII for operating "a vehicle
 
. . . while under the influence of alcohol[,]" in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2014).

2HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]

appeal, Turping contends that her OVUII charge was "fatally
 
defective" because it only used the term "alcohol" and did not 
allege the statutory definition of alcohol, which contains an
 exception for "denatured or other alcohol that is considered not
 potable under the customs laws of the United States." HRS 
§ 291E-1 (2007). Turping argues that by using the term "alcohol"
 without also alleging the exception in the statutory definition,
 the OVUII charge failed to provide her with fair notice of the
 charge against her.
 
As explained below, we reject Turping's argument. We
 
hold that Turping's OVUII charge was sufficient and provided her
 with fair notice of the offense for which she was charged.
 
DISCUSSION 

I.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Turping by complaint with OVUII, as follows:
 
On or about the 10th day of February, 2013, in the
City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, LORI L.
TURPING did intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate
or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public
way, street, road, or highway 
while under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal mental
faculties or ability to care for herself and guard against
casualty, thereby committing the offense of Operating a
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation
of Section 291E-61(a)(1) of the [HRS]. LORI L. TURPING is
 subject to sentencing as a first offender in accordance with
Section 291E-61(b)(1) of the [HRS].
 
(Emphasis added.)3
 
For purposes of the OVUII offense, the term "alcohol"
 
is defined as:
 
"Alcohol" means the product of distillation of any
fermented liquid, regardless of whether rectified, whatever
may be the origin thereof, and includes ethyl alcohol, lower
aliphatic alcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl
alcohol,
 but not denatured or other alcohol that is 
considered not potable under the customs laws of the United
States.
 
3Turping was also charged with refusal to submit to testing, in
violation of HRS § 291E-68 (Supp. 2014), and driving without motor vehicle
insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005). These charges were
dismissed with prejudice by the State and will not be further discussed.

        FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 291E-1 (emphasis added).4
 
Turping moved to dismiss the OVUII charge before trial
 
on the ground that the complaint was defective for failing to
 
allege the "special statutory definition for the term
 'alcohol[.]'" The District Court denied the motion. After a
 bench trial, the District Court found Turping guilty as charged
 and sentenced her to license revocation for a year, participation
 in substance abuse rehabilitation, a fine of $500, and various
 fees and assessments.
 
II.
 
On appeal, Turping contends that the complaint was
 
fatally defective because it failed to properly allege the
 "element of alcohol." Specifically, Turping argues that for
 purposes of the OVUII offense, the term "alcohol" is statutorily
 defined as "a certain type of alcohol" and does not include "all
 types of alcohol." Turping asserts that the State's use of the
 term alcohol in the complaint, without alleging the statutory
 definition of alcohol, resulted in the failure to state an
 offense and deprived her of fair notice of the charge. We
 disagree.
 
As explained below, the statutory exception for
 
"denatured or other alcohol that is considered not potable under
 the customs laws of the United States" (exception for denatured
 or other non-potable alcohol) is a defense to the OVUII offense
 that the State was not required to allege in its OVUII charge
 
4The definition of "alcohol" set forth in HRS § 291E-1 was added in
2000, see 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 189, § 23 at 407, and appears to have been
taken from the definition of "alcohol" in HRS § 281-1 (2007) that applies to
HRS Chapter 281. HRS Chapter 281, entitled "Intoxicating Liquor," establishes
county liquor commissions responsible for issuing licenses for the
manufacture, importation, and sale of liquors. Federal regulations provide
for means to denature alcohol thereby rendering it unfit for use as a
beverage. See 27 C.F.R. §§ 21.11, 21.21, 21.31. 
It is unclear why the Legislature chose, for purposes of the OVUII
offense, to utilize a definition of "alcohol" that excludes denatured or other
non-potable alcohol under the customs laws of the United States. It would
 appear that a person driving who is impaired by alcohol not fit to drink as a
beverage would be just as dangerous as someone impaired by alcohol fit to
drink as a beverage.

against Turping. The State's use of the term "alcohol" in its
 
OVUII charge gave Turping fair notice of the nature and cause of
 the accusation against her.
 
III.

 
A.
 
"It has long been held that indictments need not
 
anticipate and negate possible defenses; rather, it is left to
 the defendant to show his defenses at trial." 
State v. Adams , 64
 
Haw. 568, 569, 645 P.2d 308, 309 (1982). Based on this
 principle, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court in Adams held that the 
indictment was not required to include or negate a statutory
 defense in order to be sufficient. Id. at 568-70, 645 P.2d at
 
309-10.
5 In addition, HRS § 806-29 (2014) specifically provides
 
that an indictment is not required to negate exceptions set forth
 in the statute establishing the offense. HRS § 806-29 provides
 as follows:
 
§ 806-29 Exceptions need not be negatived. No
 
indictment for any offense created or defined by statute
shall be deemed objectionable for the reason that it fails
to negative any exception, excuse, or proviso contained in
the statute creating or defining the offense. The fact that
 the charge is made shall be considered as an allegation that
no legal excuse for the doing of the act existed in a
particular case. [ 6
]
In State v. Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. 353, 873 P.2d 110 
(1994), overruled on other grounds by State v. Maelega, 80 
Hawai'i 172, 178-79, 907 P.2d 758, 764-65 (1995), this court set 
5In Adams, a physician was charged by indictment with the offenses of
promoting dangerous and harmful drugs, where the charges did not include the
statutory defense provided to physicians who possessed or distributed the
drugs under authority of law. Adams, 64 Haw. at 568-69, 645 P.2d at 309. The
 
supreme court addressed the question of whether "the State, having knowledge
of a defense, must include the defense in the language of the indictment[.]"
Id. at 568, 645 P.2d at 309. The supreme court held that "the indictment was
not required to negate the defense and thus, the indictment sufficiently
alleged all of the essential elements of the offense[s] charged." Id. at 569­
71, 645 P.2d at 310. The supreme court therefore overturned the trial court's
dismissal of the indictment for failing to allege the defense. Id. at 568-71,
 
645 P.2d at 309-10.
 
6Although HRS § 806-29 applies to indictments filed in circuit court,
we see no reason why more stringent requirements would be imposed on
complaints charging less serious offenses filed in district court.

 _______________ 
Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. at 357-58, 873 P.2d at 112-113 (brackets
 
omitted; emphasis added). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has adopted 
and applied the Nobriga  framework. See State v. Jenkins, 93
 
Hawai'i 87, 106-07, 997 P.2d 13, 32-33 (2000); State v. Lee, 90 
Hawai'i 130, 137-39, 976 P.2d 444, 451-53 (1999). FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
forth a framework for determining whether an exception contained
 in a statute is a "defense" to or an "element" of an offense. In
 Nobriga, we stated:
 
The general and well-settled common law rule is that where
an exception is embodied in the language of the enacting
clause of a criminal statute,
fn/ and therefore appears to be
an integral part of the verbal description of the offense,
the burden is on the prosecution to negative that exception,
prima facie, as part of its main case. Annotation, Burden
of Averment and Proof As to Exception in Criminal Statute on
Which the Prosecution Is Based, 153 A.L.R. 1218, 1226
(1944); 1 Wharton's Criminal Evidence § 20, at 35 (C. Torcia
13th ed. 1972).
 
This general rule does not apply, however, "when the
facts hypothesized in the exceptive provision are peculiarly
within the knowledge of the defendant, or the evidence
concerning them is within the defendant's private control." 
1 Wharton's Criminal Evidence § 20, at 35. Furthermore,
when the exception appears somewhere other than in the
enacting clause, and is thus a distinct substantive
exception or proviso, the burden is on the defendant to

bring forward evidence of exceptive facts that constitute a
defense. Annotation, 153 A.L.R. at 1277-78; 1 Wharton's
Criminal Evidence § 20, at 35. The prosecutor is not
required in such instances to negative, by proof in advance,
exceptions not found in the enacting clause. 
1 Wharton's
 
Criminal Evidence § 20, at 33-34.
 
fn/ In criminal nomenclature, the term "enacting
clause" has long been applied to the prohibitory declaration
of the statute which contains the general or preliminary
description of the acts prohibited; i.e., the clause which
proscribes the offensive deed. Annotation, Burden of
Averment and Proof As to Exception in Criminal Statute on
Which the Prosecution Is Based, 153 A.L.R. 1218, 1226
(1944).
 
B.
 
In applying the Nobriga
 framework to this case, we
 
conclude that the statutory exception for denatured or other non-
potable alcohol is a "defense" to the OVUII offense, and is not 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
an "element" of the offense that is required to be alleged in an
 
OVUII charge.7 Alcohol is denatured by adding substances that
 
render it unfit for use as a beverage. See 27 C.F.R. §§ 21.11,
 
21.21, 21.31. "[P]otable" means "fit or suitable for drinking"8
 
and therefore non-potable alcohol is alcohol that is not fit to
 drink. Accordingly, the exception for denatured or other non-
potable alcohol serves to exempt individuals who become
 intoxicated as the result of alcohol that is unfit to drink as a
 beverage from prosecution for OVUII.
 
The enacting clause of the OVUII offense, HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1), uses the phrase "[w]hile under the influence of alcohol[,]" but the exception itself is found in a separate section, HRS § 291E-1. Thus, an argument can be made that the exception does not appear in the enacting clause and therefore is a "defense" and not an "element" under the Nobriga framework. See Lee, 90 Hawai
'i at 138, 976 P.2d at 452 (holding, under the 
Nobriga framework, that an exception was not contained in the enacting clause when the section containing the exception was cited in the enacting clause ("[e]xcept as provided in section 431:10C-105"), but the terms of the exception were not articulated in the enacting clause). 
However, we need not determine whether the statutory
 
exception is embodied in the enacting clause in this case. In
 Nobriga, we explained that even when embodied in the enacting
 clause, a statutory exception constitutes a defense to a criminal
 offense "when the facts hypothesized in the exceptive provision
 are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, or the
 evidence concerning them is within the defendant's private
 control." Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. at 358, 873 P.2d at 113

For purposes of determining the sufficiency of a charge, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court has considered the elements of an offense to be "(1) conduct;
(2) attendant circumstances; and (3) results of conduct." State v. Mita, 124 
Hawai'i 385, 391, 245 P.3d 458, 464 (2010).

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Whether a 
defendant's alcohol intoxication and impairment are attributable to alcohol unfit to drink as a beverage, which falls within the statutory exception for denatured or other non-potable alcohol, concern facts that are peculiarly within the defendant's knowledge and evidence within the defendant's private control. See Jenkins, 93 Hawai
'i at 107, 997 P.2d at 33 (holding that 
whether the defendant did or did not possess a hunting license was a fact peculiarly within the defendant's knowledge, and therefore, the statutory exception to the "place to keep" offense pertaining to individuals with a hunting license constituted a defense). 
Moreover, the Legislature's evident purpose in making 
it a crime to drive while impaired by alcohol was to prevent and deter deaths, injuries, and property damage caused by drunk drivers. See State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 63, 332 P.3d 661, 665 
(App. 2014); State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai 'i 139, 146, 63 P.3d 
1109, 1116 (2003) (Moon, C.J., dissenting) (noting that the obvious purpose of drunk driving statutes is "to prevent people from driving unsafely due to an alcohol-induced diminished capacity" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

Unless a defendant specifically disclosed the type of alcohol he or she consumed, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the prosecution to prove in its case in chief the type of alcohol the defendant consumed. Furthermore, the cases in which a defendant's alcohol intoxication is due to alcohol falling within the statutory exception for denatured or other non-potable alcohol would appear to be quite rare. Accordingly, it would be absurd and contrary to the Legislature's purpose in criminalizing drunk driving to construe the exception for 
9In support of legislation enacted to establish a felony offense for
habitual OVUII and to lower the blood alcohol concentration threshold from .10
 
to .08, the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that it "believes vigorous
enforcement, together with education and public awareness, provides the key to
reducing the number of alcohol-related accidents and deaths on our highways."
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1265, in 1995 Senate Journal, at 1301.

denatured or other non-potable alcohol to be an element of the 
OVUII offense, rather than a defense, and thus to require the State to prove in every case that the defendant's intoxication was not due to alcohol falling within the exception. See Lee, 90 
Hawai
'i at 138, 976 P.2d at 452 (holding that with respect to the 
offense of driving without insurance, to require the State to disprove the exception for self-insurance, which is likely to be quite rare, in every case would be absurd and would defeat the Legislature's purpose by increasing the difficulty of proving lack of coverage). 
C.
 
Because the statutory exception for denatured or other
 
non-potable alcohol is a "defense" to and not an "element" of the
 OVUII offense, the State was not required to allege in Turping's
 OVUII charge that her alcohol impairment was not due to alcohol
 falling within the exception. See Adams, 64 Haw. at 569, 645
 
P.2d at 309; HRS § 806-29; see also United States v. Hester, 719
 F.2d 1041, 1043 (9th Cir. 1983); United States v. Steele, 147
 F.3d 1316, 1319-20 (11th Cir. 1998); State v. Gyenes, 855 P.2d
 642, 645 n.3 (Or. Ct App. 1993). We therefore hold that the
 State's OVUII charge was sufficient.
 
IV.
 
A.
 
Turping cites Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 
(2009), in support of her argument that the charge was rendered defective by the State's failure to specifically allege the statutory definition of the term "alcohol" that contained the exception for denatured or other non-potable alcohol. Turping's reliance on Wheeler is misplaced. 
In Wheeler, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that an 
OVUII charge was insufficient for failing to allege the statutory definition of the term "operate," which is defined by HRS § 291E-1 to mean "to drive or assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway . . . ." Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 391-93, 219 P.3d at 1178-80 (quoting HRS 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
§ 291E-1). The supreme court held that the phrase "upon a
 
public, way, street, road, or highway" in the statutory
 definition created a locational requirement that constituted an
 essential element of the offense. Id. The supreme court further
 
held that merely alleging that Wheeler did "operate" a vehicle in
 Wheeler's charge was insufficient to allege this locational
 essential element. Id. at 393-96, 219 P.3d at 1180-83. The
 
court explained that unlike the statutory definition, the
 commonly understood meaning of the term "operate" does not impose
 a locational requirement or "geographically limit where the
 conduct must take place." Id. at 394, 219 P.3d at 1181. 
Accordingly, alleging that the defendant did "operate" a vehicle
 would not fairly apprise a person of common understanding of the
 locational essential element in terms that were "unmistakable" or
 "readily comprehensible." Id. 
In State v. Mita, 124 Hawai
'i 385, 245 P.3d 458 (2010), 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court explained that Wheeler was based on two 
significant factors, neither of which applied in Mita's case. First, the statutory definition of the term "operate" created an additional essential element for the offense. Mita, 124 Hawai
'i 
at 390-91, 245 P.3d at 463-64. Second, the statutory definition of "operate" departed from the term's commonly understood meaning to such an extent that alleging the term "operate" failed to provide fair notice of the additional essential element. Id. 
Distinguishing Wheeler on these bases, the supreme court held that Mita's charge, which did not allege the definition of "animal nuisance" set forth in a city ordinance, was sufficient. Id. at 391, 245 P.3d at 464.
10 The Mita court concluded that 
10In Mita, the defendant was charged with violating a section of a city
ordinance by engaging in "animal nuisance." Mita, 124 Hawai' i at 386-87, 245
P.3d at 459-60. The term "animal nuisance was defined in a separate section
of the ordinance. Id. Similar to Turping's argument in this case, Mita
objected to the charge, claiming that it failed to give her notice of whattype of "animal nuisance" she was being charged with under the ordinancedefinition of "animal nuisance." Id.
 at 386, 245 P.3d at 459. 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
unlike in Wheeler, where the charge "contained a hidden
 
[essential] element," (1) the definition of "animal nuisance"
 "does not create an additional essential element of the offense";
 and (2) "the definition of 'animal nuisance' is consistent with
 its commonly understood meaning and therefore Mita had fair
 notice of the offense charged." Id. at 391, 393, 245 P.3d at
 
464, 466.
 
The Mita court made clear that Wheeler does not
 
generally require the State to allege the statutory definition of
 a term used to prescribe an offense for a charge to be
 sufficient:
 
Wheeler does not require that the State provide statutory
definitions in every charge which tracks the language of astatute that includes terms defined elsewhere in the code. Requiring the State to do so would render charges undulycomplex, in contravention of the policy reflected in[Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 7(d) that "[t]he
charge shall be a plain, concise and definite statement ofthe essential facts constituting the offense charged."Rather, as this court concluded in Wheeler, the State needonly allege the statutory definition of a term when itcreates an additional essential element of the offense, andthe term itself does not provide a person of commonunderstanding with fair notice of that element. 
Id. at 391–92, 245 P.3d at 464–65 (some brackets in original;
 
emphasis added).
 
B.
 
Mita, and not Wheeler, is the applicable precedent for
 
this case. As in Mita, and unlike in Wheeler, the statutory
 definition of the term "alcohol" does not create an additional
 essential element. The term "alcohol" is part of the attendant
 circumstance element of "while under the influence of alcohol,"
 which must be proved to establish the OVUII offense. Turping's
 OVUII charge alleged that she operated a vehicle "while under the
 influence of alcohol[.]" Therefore, unlike in Wheeler, there was
 no hidden essential element that the charge failed to disclose. 
Turping's OVUII charge alleged all the essential elements of the
 offense.
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
In addition, as in Mita and unlike in Wheeler, the 
statutory definition of "alcohol" is consistent with the commonly 
understood meaning of the term, especially in the context of an offense directed at prohibiting people from driving after consuming alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair their ability to drive. The statutory definition of "alcohol" encompasses and is consistent with the common meaning of "alcohol" as "ethanol [(also called ethyl alcohol)] esp[ecially] when considered as the intoxicating agent in fermented and distilled liquors[;] . . . drink . . . containing ethanol[.]"
11 The OVUII charge against 
Turping specifically alleged that she operated a vehicle "while under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal mental faculties or ability to care for herself and guard against casualty." Accordingly, the State's OVUII charge gave Turping fair notice that she was accused of operating a vehicle after consuming alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her ability to drive. See Mita, 124 Hawai
'i at 391, 245 P.3d at 
464.
 
As previously discussed, the statutory exception for
 
denatured or other non-potable alcohol is a defense that was not
 required to be alleged in the charge to provide Turping with fair
 notice of the cause and accusation against her. Indeed, the
 exception is only implicated in the unusual and anomalous
 situation in which a person's alcohol intoxication and impairment
 is attributable to alcohol unfit to drink as a beverage. Turping
 does not contend that the exception was implicated in her case;
 she does not contend that she became intoxicated and impaired due
 to alcohol falling within the exception. We conclude that

(definition of "alcohol" and "ethanol"); see Dictionary.com, http://

containing this substance" (British Dictionary definition) (last accessed Feb.

Turping's challenge to the sufficiency of her OVUII charge is
 
without merit.
