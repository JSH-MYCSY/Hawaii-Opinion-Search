OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
FRANCIS M. SHYANGUYA, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
EMPLOYMENT SECURITY APPEALS REFEREES’ OFFICE (ESARO), et al.,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0149)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal in appellate court case number CAAP­
13-0003037 that Appellant-Appellant Francis M. Shyanguya
 (Appellant Shyanguya) has asserted from the Honorable Rhonda A.
 Nishimura’s July 23, 2013 post-judgment order denying Appellant
 Shyanguya’s June 27, 2013 post-judgment motion for entry of
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finding of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52 of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), because Appellant 
Shyanguya's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0003037 is untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-15 (1993) provides
 
that "[r]eview of any final judgment of the circuit court under
 this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." HRS § 91-15
 (1993). The intermediate court of appeals has jurisdiction "[t]o
 hear and determine appeals from any court or agency when appeals
 are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) (Supp. 2012). The law
 provides that "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from
 all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . .
 courts[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2012). Appeals under
 HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the
 
1
rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 72(k)  requires
that, upon a circuit court's determination of an administrative appeal, "the court having jurisdiction shall enter judgment[.]" Therefore, the separate document rule under the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 869 
P.2d 1334 (1994), applies to an administrative appeal before a circuit court. See, e.g., Raquinio v. Nakanelua, 77 Hawai
'i 499, 
500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth in Jenkins apply to 
1
 Rule 81(e) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure requires that
the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall apply to any proceedings in a
circuit court pursuant to appeal to the circuit court from a governmental
official or body (other than a court), except as otherwise provided in Rule72."

appeals from circuit court orders deciding appeals from orders 
entered by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations."). Under the separate judgment document rule, "[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 
119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). The circuit court’s June 20, 2013 judgment resolved all claims in the circuit court by entering judgment in favor of and against the appropriate parties, and, thus, the June 20, 2013 judgment appears to satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 91­15, HRS § 602-57(1), and HRS § 641-1(a).

Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),  Appellant Shyanguya
extended the initial thirty-day time period under HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal from the June 20, 2013
 judgment when Appellant Shyanguya filed the June 27, 2013 HRCP
 Rule 52 post-judgment motion for entry of findings of fact and
 conclusions of law within ten days after entry of the June 20,
 2013 judgment, as HRCP Rule 52 required for such a motion. 
However, Appellant Shyanguya did not file his August 23, 2013

 Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure provides: 
(3) Time to Appeal Affected by Post-Judgment Motions. If
 
any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law,
to amend findings or make additional findings, for a new trial, to
reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or order, or for
attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing the notice of appeal
is extended until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the
motion; provided that the failure to dispose of any motion by
order entered upon the record within 90 days after the date the
motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
(Emphases added).

notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the July 23, 
2013 post-judgment order denying Shyanguya’s June 27, 2013 HRCP Rule 52 post-judgment motion for entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) required for a timely appeal. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 
1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction over the untimely appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0003037. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0003037 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
