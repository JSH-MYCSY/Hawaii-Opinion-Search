NO. CAAP-13-0003064
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KENNETH A. MONIZ, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-0176)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kenneth A. Moniz (Moniz) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence, entered
 
on August 5, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 (Circuit Court).
1
 
After entering into a conditional Guilty Plea, Moniz
 
was convicted of Habitually Operating a Vehicle Under the
 Influence of an Intoxicant (HOVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61.5 (2007 and Supp. 2014). Moniz
 reserved his right to appeal the denial of his Motion to Suppress
 Evidence. 
On appeal, Moniz contends the Circuit Court erred by 
denying his Motion to Suppress because (1) he was specifically advised that he had no right to an attorney, in violation of HRS ยง 803-9 (2014) and (2) his right to Due Process under the Hawai
'i 
Constitution was violated when he was not given a Miranda warning.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Moniz's point of error as follows:
 
(1) Moniz was not improperly advised that he was not 
entitled to an attorney, in violation of HRS ยง 803-9. State v. 
Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 74, 332 P.3d 661, 676 (App. 2014), cert. 
granted, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014). 
(2) A Miranda warning was not required to be given to
 
Moniz before determining whether he would submit to a breath,
 blood, or urine test. Id. at 72, 332 P.3d at 674 (Miranda rights
 
not implicated or violated by the police action in obtaining
 agreement to submit to a breath test).
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence, entered on August 5, 2013 in the Circuit
 Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, April 17, 2015.
