IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
IN THE INTEREST OF SP
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 10-00102)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Mother (Mother) appeals from the
 
Order Terminating Parental Rights, filed August 8, 2013 in the
 
1
Family Court of the First Circuit  (family court).  
In terminating Mother's parental rights to her child, 
SP, the family court concluded that (1) Mother was not currently 
willing and able to provide a safe family home to SP, (2) it was not reasonably foreseeable that Mother would become willing and able to provide a safe family home to SP, and (3) the October 1, 2012 Proposed Permanent Plan (
October PPP) submitted by 
Petitioner-Appellee Department of Human Services, State of Hawai
'i (DHS) with the stated goal of adoption was in the best 
interest of SP.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mother's point of error as follows.
 
On appeal, Mother claims the record lacks substantial
 
evidence to support the finding tha
 t the October PPP, which was approved by the family court, is in
 the best interest of SP. Mother notes that a prior proposed
 permanent plan was disapproved by the family court because it
 identified Father's relatives on the mainland as prospective
 adoptive parents of SP. Mother admits the October PPP deleted
 all reference to specific placement for SP. However, Mother
 maintains DHS nonetheless intends to place SP with the previously
 identified adoptive parents. Thus, Mother contends the plan is
 not in the best interest of SP.
 
During the proceeding on August 8, 2013, Mother did not
 
challenge the October PPP based on its goal of adoption. Rather,
 Mother argued she would not agree to any permanent plan that did
 not include a specific placement provision because it "leaves it
 up in the air as to where [SP] will be placed." Mother objects
 on the basis that DHS still intends to place SP with Father's
 relatives on the mainland despite removal of that provision in
 the October PPP. Mother preferred adoption by SP's current local
 caregivers.
 
Barry Kwock (Kwock), a DHS social worker, testified the
 
goal of adoption is to provide SP with a safe and stable loving
 home. Kwock also testified that the prior proposed permanent
 plan erroneously identified where SP would be placed. He stated
 the October PPP did not specify who would adopt SP. Kwock did
 state DHS has a general policy of placing children with relatives
 if possible and that if allowed by the family court, SP would be 
placed with Father's relatives on the mainland. However, Kwock
 also stated that DHS had not made a decision on where to place SP
 and would look into the issue of placement again given the family
 court's denial of the prior proposed permanent plan.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Specification of adoptive parents is not required in a
 
proposed permanent plan under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 587A-32 (Supp. 2013). In addition, under HRS § 587A-33(b)(3)
 
(Supp. 2013), after the family court terminates parental rights,
 terminates the existing service plan, and revokes foster custody,
 the permanent custody of the child shall be awarded to an
 appropriate authorized agency. Thus, the family court cannot
 approve a permanent plan that specifies adoptive parents because
 it is contrary to HRS § 587A-33(b)(3).
 
In the August 8, 2013 Order Terminating Parental
 
Rights, the family court ordered all parties to appear at a
 permanency hearing on November 12, 2013. "At each permanency
 hearing where a permanent plan is ordered, the court shall make
 appropriate orders to ensure timely implementation of the
 permanent plan and to ensure that the plan is accomplished within
 a specified period of time." HRS § 587A-31(e) (Supp. 2013). 
Thus, the issue of the permanent adoption of SP is not determined
 until after termination of Mother's parental rights and approval
 of a permanent plan and approval by the family court after a
 permanency hearing. 
The October PPP approved by the family court was
 
supported by clear and convincing evidence that adoption was in
 the best interest of SP and it was made in accordance with HRS
 §§ 587A-32 and -33.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Terminating
