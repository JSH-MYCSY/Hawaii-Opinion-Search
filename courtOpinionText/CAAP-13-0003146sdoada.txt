On appeal, Kuroiwa argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
in denying Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence and Dismiss
 
Complaint (Motion to Suppress), and challenges the Circuit
 
Court's Findings of Fact (FOFs) 1-5 and Conclusions of Law (COLs)
 
1-3, which were set forth in the Circuit Court's March 18, 2013
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying
 Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence and Dismiss Complaint.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kuroiwa's contentions as follows:
 
Kuroiwa's challenges to the Circuit Court's FOFs are 
without merit. The record in this case includes substantial evidence to support each of the court's FOFs, specifically the testimony of Officers Maddock and Tomita, and Borthwick Mortuary's gardener. To the extent that conflicting testimony was presented in some instances, such conflicts present issues concerning credibility and the weight of the evidence, which are in the province of the trial court. See, e.g., In re Jane Doe, 
95 Hawai
'i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001); State v. Patterson, 
58 Haw. 462, 468, 571 P.2d 745, 749 (1977). 
To the extent that the Circuit Court's COLs present 
mixed questions of fact and law, the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of this case and we review them under the clearly erroneous standard; the court's interpretation of the applicable law nevertheless remains freely reviewable. See, e.g., State v. Roman, 119 Hawai
'i 468, 477, 199 
P.3d 57, 66 (2008). Here, the factual determinations within the Circuit Court's COLs are supported by substantial evidence in the record.

Kuroiwa's legal argument remains, however, that Officer
 
Tomita conducted an illegal search and seizure of the pipe
 
because he did not have a warrant, and no warrant exception
 applies here because Kuroiwa was on private property and thus had
 a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
"A 'search' implies that there is an exploration for an 
item or that the item is hidden." State v. Meyer, 78 Hawai
'i 
308, 312, 893 P.2d 159, 163 (1995) (citing State v. Hanawahine, 50 Haw. 461, 465, 443 P.2d 149, 152 (1968)). "However, neither factor is present in open view . . . observations," thus such observations do not involve "a search in the constitutional sense." Id. at 312, 893 P.2d at 163 (citation omitted). "In 
other words, neither open view nor plain view observations involve an invasion of an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy." Id. (citations omitted). An "open view" observation 
is one that 
takes place from a non-intrusive vantage point. The
 
governmental agent is either on the outside looking outside
or on the outside looking inside [at] that which is
knowingly exposed to the public. The object under
observation is not within the scope of the constitution.
 
Id. at 313, 893 P.2d at 164 (quoting State v. Kaaheena, 59 Haw.
 
23, 28-29, 575 P.2d 462, 466-67 (1978)).
 
In State v. Hook, 60 Haw. 197, 201, 587 P.2d 1224, 1227 
(1978), a police officer observed marijuana plants beside a staircase in an alleyway on private property that were not shielded from public view. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that 
the "total lack of concealment or isolation from the view or grasp of persons in the common area negated any reasonable expectation of privacy on the part of appellee." Id. (citation 
omitted). As such, the plants were not in a constitutionally protected area and were subject to summary seizure as contraband. Id. 
Here, although the parking lot of Borthwick Mortuary
 
was private property, the pipe that Kuroiwa was holding as she
 sat on a curb in the parking lot was viewable by the public from
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the sidewalk outside the parking lot, and was in fact openly
 
viewed from that vantage point by Officer Tomita. Thus, Kuroiwa
 had no reasonable expectation of privacy and no warrant or
 exigent circumstances were required for the officer's seizure of
 the pipe. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's August 2, 2013
 
Judgment is affirmed.
