CAPITAL ONE BANK (USA), N.A., Plaintiff-Appellee,
HARRY D. HUFFMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1RC12-1-1379)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant pro se, Harry D. Huffman (Huffman)
 
appeals from the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment, Filed on June 19, 2013" entered July 31, 2013 in the
 
1
District Court of the First Circuit, Ewa Division  (district
 
court).
 
On appeal, Huffman contends the district court erred in 
granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-
Appellee Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. (Capital One) because (1) 
the evidence that Capital One submitted in support of its motion 
for summary judgment did not satisfy Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(e), and (2) genuine issues of fact 
remained for trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Huffman's appeal is without merit.

A. Capital One's evidence satisfies HRCP Rule 56(e).
 
1. The Agreement and Billing Statements were
admissible as "records of regularly conducted
activity."
 
Huffman contends the district court erred in relying
 
upon the declaration submitted by Barbara S. Edwards (Edwards), a
 
Litigation Support Representative for Capital One, because the
 
documents she referred to constituted inadmissible hearsay. 
Edwards attached two exhibits to her declaration: (1) A "true and
 correct copy" of the "credit account agreement" (Agreement) to
 
which Huffman was subject and (2) "true and correct copies of
 
[Huffman's] most recent billing statement(s) (Billing Statements)
 
showing the amounts owed. . . ." To be admissible under the
 
hearsay exception for "records of regularly conducted activity,"
 the Agreement and Billing Statements must satisfy foundational
 requirements set forth in Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
2	 3
803(b)(6) (Supp. 2013) or HRE Rule 902(11)  (Supp. 2013).  Since

Rule 803. Hearsay exception; availability of
declarant immaterial.
 
. . . . 
(b) Other exceptions.

 (6) Records of regularly conducted
activity. A memorandum, report,
record, or data compilation, in any
form, of acts, events, conditions,
opinions, or diagnoses, made in the
course of a regularly conducted
activity, at or near the time of the
acts, events, conditions, opinions,
or diagnoses, as shown by the
testimony of the custodian or other
qualified witness, or by
certification that complies with
rule 902(11) or a statute permitting
certification, unless the sources of
information or other circumstances
 indicate lack of trustworthiness.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the foundational requirements for each rule are essentially the
 
same, we refer to them interchangeably.
 
Huffman contends Edwards is not an "other qualified
 
person" under HRE Rule 902(11) and, therefore, could not certify
 the documents. HRE Rule 902(11) was created in 2002 to provide a
 means for parties to establish a foundation to admit "records of
 regularly conducted activity" without requiring testimony from
 "the custodian [of the records] or other qualified witness." HRE
 Rule 803 supp. cmt. (brackets in original); HRE Rule 902 supp.
 cmt. HRE Rule 803(b)(6) and Rule 902(11) state that a qualified
 individual can establish the necessary foundation to admit a
 record of regularly conducted activity into evidence. HRE Rule
 803(b)(6) (foundation satisfied by the testimony of an "other
 qualified witness") and HRE Rule 902(11) (foundation satisfied by
 the written declaration of an "other qualified person"). 
Under HRE Rule 803(b)(6), a "qualified witness" can 
authenticate a document as a record of regularly conducted activity "even if he or she is not an employee of the business that created the document, or has no direct, personal knowledge of how the document was created." State v. Fitzwater, 122 
Hawai
'i 354, 366, 227 P.3d 520, 532 (2010), as amended (Apr. 5, 
2010). To be an "other qualified witness," "[t]he witness need only have enough familiarity with the record-keeping system of the business in question to explain how the record came into 
3(...continued)
 
activity. The original or a duplicate of
a domestic or foreign record of regularly
conducted activity that would be
admissible under rule 803(b)(6), if
accompanied by a written declaration of
its custodian or other qualified person,
certifying that the record was:
 
(A)	 Made at or near the time of the
 
occurrence of the matters set forth
 by, or from information transmitted
by, a person with knowledge of those
matters;
 
(B)	 Kept in the course of the regularly
conduct  e  d activity; and
 
(C)	 Made by the regularly conducted
activity as a regular practice.

existence in the ordinary course of business." Id. (citation 
omitted). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court instructs that the phrase 
"other qualified witness" under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) should be 
broadly interpreted, but is silent as to whether the courts should also broadly interpret "other qualified person" under HRE Rule 902(11). See Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i at 366, 227 P.3d at 
532.
 
We conclude the district court did not err in 
determining that Edwards is an "other qualified witness" or "other qualified person." Edwards was a Litigation Support Representative for Capital One and in that capacity, she was "responsible for verifying the amounts due and owing [Capital One] on its credit accounts[.]" In addition, Edwards declared that she had access to Capital One's documents and records that related to Huffman's credit card account. Although Edwards did not personally assemble the documents, her affidavit shows that she was familiar with Capital One's record-keeping system so as to be an "other qualified witness" or "other qualified person" who could certify the documents under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) or HRE Rule 902(11). See Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i at 366, 227 P.3d at 
532.
 
Huffman also argues that the Billing Statements are
 
inadmissible because they are photocopies of the original
 documents. However, copies of documents are generally admissible
 to the same extent as an original. See HRE Rule 1003 (1993). In
 
addition, under HRE Rule 902(11), photocopies of regularly
 conducted activity records are admissible as long as they comply
 with HRE Rule 803(b)(6). The photocopies satisfy HRE Rule
 803(b)(6) because Edwards' affidavit indicates that the documents
 referred to in her affidavit were "made in the ordinary course of
 [Capital One's] regularly conducted business activity and
 contain[ed] entries made at or near the time of the acts or
 events therein in connection with [Huffman's] debt owed to
 [Capital One.]" Thus, the Agreement and the Billing Statements
 satisfied HRE Rules 803(b)(6) and 902(11) and were admissible as
 "records of regularly conducted activity."

2. Edwards had personal knowledge and competence to
Testify to the matters in her affidavit.
 
Huffman contends the district court erred when it
 
granted Capital One's motion for summary judgment because Edwards
 
"testif[ied] to numerous matters of which she could not possibly
 have had personal knowledge" and because she was "incompetent." 
Huffman contends Edwards did not have personal knowledge pursuant
 to HRE Rule 602 (1993) because she based her beliefs on "a
 reading of [the] records."
 
Under HRE Rule 602, personal knowledge means that "the 
witness perceived the event about which he testifies and that he has a present recollection of that perception." Personal knowledge requirements "apply to a hearsay statement admitted under any of the hearsay exceptions . . . in that admissibility of a hearsay statement is predicated on the foundation requirement of the witness' personal knowledge of the making of the statement itself." HRE Rule 602 cmt. An affiant satisfies the "personal knowledge" requirements if the affiant has personal knowledge of how the hearsay statement was made and the hearsay statement falls within a hearsay exception, such as the "records of regularly conducted business activity" exception. See Duke v. 
Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 893 F.Supp. 2d 1238, 1244 (N.D. Ala. 2012) (personal knowledge for a summary judgment affidavit "can be based on a review of relevant business files and records" when such files and records are admissible under the rules of evidence); see also Colonial Pacific Leasing Corp. v. N & N Partners, LLC, 981 F.Supp. 2d 1345, 1355 (N.D. Ga. 2013). Furthermore, "the [HRCP] Rule 56(e) requirement of personal knowledge and competence to testify may be inferred from the affidavits themselves." Stallard v. Consolidated Maui, Inc., 103 
Hawai
'i 468, 475, 83 P.3d 731, 738 (2004). 
As a Litigation Support Representative, Edwards was
 
"responsible for verifying the amounts due and owing [Capital
 One] on its credit [card] accounts[.]" It can be reasonably
 inferred from her responsibilities that she had personal
 knowledge about the policies and procedures that pertain to
 Capital One's various credit card accounts. See id.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4Huffman also contends that Edwards' reliance on the Agreement
illustrates "Edwards' lack of competence and credibility as a witness." 
Huffman states that "[a]t the bottom of the last page of Exhibit '1,' the
[Agreement,] contains the copyright notice '© 2010 Capital One,' indicatingthat it was created in 2010, whereas the billing statements included in
Exhibit '2' claim account activity as far back as November, 2006."  However,
Edwards' affidavit stated that "[Capital One] allowed [Huffman] to use acredit [card] account subject to the terms of a credit [card] account
agreement."  Edwards did not allege that the Agreement was the agreement that
Huffman signed, but, rather, she declared that the Agreement contained theterms to which Huffman was subject.  Huffman does not deny that he is subject
to the terms of the Agreement nor does he present evidence that would raise a
genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is subject to the terms thatCapital One provided.  Thus, Huffman's argument is without merit.
6Additionally, Edwards had the requisite personal knowledge to
testify to the information contained in the Agreement and Billing
Statements themselves because those documents were admissible
under the "records of regularly conducted activity" exception to
the hearsay rule.4  Edwards had the required personal knowledge
and competency to testify to those matters included in her
affidavit, therefore, her affidavit satisfies the requirements
under HRCP Rule 56(e).
B.There are no genuine issues of material fact for trial .
"Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."  Ralston v. Yim , 129
Hawai#i 46, 55, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285 (2013) (quoting First Ins.
Co. of Hawaii v. A&B Properties, 126 Hawai# i 406, 413-14, 271
P.3d 1165, 1172-73 (2012) (brackets omitted, format altered)). 
In a motion for summary judgment, the moving party has the
initial burden to "show the absence of any genuine issue as to
all material facts[.]"  Ralston, at 56, 292 P.3d at 1286 (quoting
French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai #i 462, 470, 99 P.3d
1046, 1054 (2004) (format altered)).  "Only when the moving party
satisfies its initial burden of production, does the burden shift
to the nonmoving party to respond to the motion for summary
judgment and demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general
allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial." 
Ralston, at 56-57, 292 P.3d at 1286-87.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1. There was no genuine issue of material fact
regarding Huffman's indebtedness to Capital One.
 
Huffman contends Capital One failed to prove that it
 
was in contract with him because it did not provide a signed
 
credit card agreement. Under these circumstances, a signed
 agreement is not necessary for Capital One to prevail on its
 motion for summary judgment. See Hew v. Aruda, 51 Haw. 451, 458,
 
462 P.2d 476, 480-81 (1969) ("[A]n action for an account stated
 springs from a new promise, which may be express or implied, and
 not from the original indebtedness which may be unenforceable.").
 
Capital One filed its complaint under the theory of 
assumpsit-money owed. "Assumpsit is a common law form of action which allows for the recovery of damages for non-performance of a contract, either express or implied, written or verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations." 808 Dev., LLC v. Murakami, 
111 Hawai
'i 349, 366, 141 P.3d 996, 1013 (2006) (citation, 
internal quotation marks, and emphases omitted). "An account stated is an agreement between persons who have had previous transactions, fixing the amount due in respect of such transactions." Scott v. Hawaiian Tobacco Plantation, 21 Haw. 
493, 495 (Haw. Terr. 1913) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The record shows that between November 2006 and May
 
2010, Capital One transmitted to Huffman monthly Billing
 Statements that indicated definite sums that he owed Capital One. 
The record also shows that Huffman made timely online payments,
 in varying amounts, from November 2006 to September 2009,
 indicating that he received the Billing Statements. In addition,
 Huffman made credit card purchases from November 2006 until
 October 2009 without disputing any of the outstanding balances
 reflected on his monthly Billing Statements. See Hew, 51 Haw. at
 
459, 462 P.2d at 481 (citation omitted) ("[S]ilence in the light
 of previous dealings between parties may operate as assent."). 
The record shows that an account stated was created between
 Huffman and Capital One. See Barwick Pac. Carpet Co. v. Kam
 
Hawaii Const., Inc., 2 Haw. App. 253, 257, 630 P.3d 638, 641
 (1981) (holding that an account stated was created between a
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contractor and supplier where invoices were sent to and received
 
by the contractor and the contractor failed to object).
 
In his opposition to Capital One's motion for summary
 
judgment, Huffman did not deny his indebtedness to Capital One. 
Instead, he claimed "[he has] in the past had multiple Capital
 One credit card accounts" and that "[he has] thus far been unable
 to determine from memory or from records remaining in [his]
 possession whether this [credit card] account was one of them." 
This was insufficient to satisfy his burden and, therefore,
 summary judgment in favor of Capital One was appropriate. See
 
Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. v. Stewart, No. CAAP-11-0000128
 (App. Aug. 30, 2013) (SDO).
 
2. There was no genuine issue of material fact
regarding Huffman's liability for disputed charges to
his credit card account.
 
Huffman contends "[his] claim, that the billing
 
statements presented in Exhibit '2' to the Edwards Affidavit show
 
credit card payments to parties from who Huffman has never
 purchased goods or services, is a valid issue for trial." 
Huffman contends there was a genuine issue for trial because the
 Billing Statements were not admissible and because "Capital One
 has failed to provide any evidence that it ever provided these
 statements to Huffman prior to the filing of the motion for
 summary judgment." We have concluded the Billing Statements are
 admissible, so we turn our attention to Huffman's argument that
 Capital One failed to prove they provided Huffman with Billing
 Statements prior to this action.
 
In order to contest a charge, a credit card holder is
 
required to give timely notice of an alleged billing error after
 receiving the billing statement. See Transameria Ins. Co. v.
 
Standard Oil Co., 325 N.W.2d 210, 215-16 (N. Dakota 1982);
 Barwick Pac. Carpet Co., 2 Haw. App. at 256-57, 630 P.2d at
 640-41. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Capital
 One submitted monthly Billing Statements with Huffman's name,
 address, and credit card account number. The Billing Statements
 also show that Huffman made timely online payments, in varying
 amounts, from November 2006 to September 2009, indicating that he
 received the Billing Statements. Huffman did not allege that he
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
gave Capital One timely notice of the alleged billing errors. In 
response to Capital One's evidence, Huffman had to "demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial." See Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i at 56­
57, 292 P.3d at 1286-87. Huffman failed to present any facts to rebut Capital One's evidence and, thus, there was no genuine issue for trial. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 31, 2013 "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion For Summary Judgment Filed on June
 19, 2013" entered in the District Court of the First Circuit, Ewa
 Division is affirmed.
