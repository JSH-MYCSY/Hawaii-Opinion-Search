IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee, v.
BETTY A. FOSTER, Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
('EWA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-00279)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee State of Hawai 'i 
(State) and Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant Betty A. Foster 
(Foster) appeal from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (Judgment), entered on August 6, 2013, by the District Court of the First Circuit, 
'Ewa Division (District 
Court).1 The Judgment dismissed without prejudice the charge of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2015) brought against Foster on January 18, 2013. 
On appeal, the State argues that the District Court
 
erred by dismissing the charge because it was ready to proceed
 with trial. On cross-appeal, Foster claims the District Court
 erred by dismissing the charge without prejudice instead of with
 prejudice.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the State's point of error as follows:
 
The District Court abused its discretion by dismissing
 
the charge against Foster because it lacked a legal basis for
 doing so.
 
A court does have inherent power to dismiss a criminal 
case. Under article VI, section 1 of the Hawai
'i Constitution 
and HRS ยง 603-21.9 (1993), "which grants courts the power to take steps 'necessary' for the promotion of justice," a trial court's "inherent power include[s] the 'power to administer justice.'" State v. Mageo, 78 Hawai
'i 33, 37, 889 P.2d 1092, 1096 
(App. 1995) (citing State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 55, 647 P.2d 705, 711-12 (1982)). 
[U]nder this aspect of the judicial power, trial courts have
the power to dismiss sua sponte an indictment with prejudice
and over the objection of the prosecuting attorney[ ]
[w]ithin the bounds of duly exercised discretion[.] The
 parameters within which this discretion is properly
exercised requires a balancing [of] the interest of the
state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the
added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court
system.
 
Id. (emphasis and alteration in original) (citations and internal
 
quotation marks omitted). A serious threat to the integrity of
 the judicial process, clear denial of due process, evidence some
 constitutional right has been violated, arbitrary action, or
 governmental misconduct justifies use of such power. State v.
 
Alvey, 67 Haw. 49, 57, 678 P.2d 5, 10 (1984).
 
However, such supervisory power to dismiss a charge is
 
not so broad as to allow dismissal prior to a first trial or
 "just to ease a crowded docket." Id. at 57, 678 P.2d at 10-11. 
The District Court dismissed the charge prior to Foster's first
 trial. Foster did not allege a violation of her due process or
 other constitutional rights. Foster pointed to no evidence of
 arbitrary action or governmental misconduct. Both parties had
 asked to continue the trial before August 6, 2013.
2 This trial
 
date was set at the request of Foster because she would be in
 Honolulu for another trial, yet on August 6, 2013 argued that

 Foster moved for a continuance on March 8, 2013. The State moved
 
for a continuance on April 9, 2013 and May 28, 2013. The District Court
 
continued the case sua sponte due to court congestion on July 16, 2013.

this other trial was the reason she could not proceed to trial on
 
the instant charge. The State was ready to proceed with trial on
 this date and strenuously objected to the dismissal.
 
Furthermore, although the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 48 deadline was mentioned by the District Court and the attorneys, it was undisputed that, as of August 6, 2013, the six-month deadline had not been reached, and the exact deadline was as yet undetermined.
3 Foster did not assert her 
constitutional right to a speedy trial, nor does she claim it was violated on appeal. 
Given all the circumstances in this case, the dismissal
 
as an exercise of the District Court's inherent power was an
 abuse of discretion.
 
Our resolution of the State's appeal renders Foster's
 
appeal moot.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on August 6, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit, 
'Ewa Division is 
vacated and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this disposition.
