STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
JOHN D. STOVER, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
SOUTH KOHALA DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 3DCW-12-0000753)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals 
from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 
Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss With Prejudice" entered on
October 3, 2013, in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 
1
South Kohala Division  (district court).  The State charged
 
Defendant-Appellee John D. Stover (Stover) by complaint with
 Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree in violation of
 
2
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 707-715 (2014)  and 
 
1
 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.
 
2
 HRS § 707-715 provides in pertinent part
 
§707-715 Terroristic threatening, defined. A person
commits the offense of terroristic threatening if the person
threatens, by word or conduct, to cause bodily injury to
another person or serious damage or harm to property,
including the pets or livestock, of another or to commit a
felony:

707-717 (2014).3 The district court granted Stover's motion to 
dismiss because the court concluded that Stover did not have "a 
specific intent, as defined by the Hawai 'i Revised Statutes, for 
the charge of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree[,]" and thus the State had failed to establish probable cause for the charged offense. 
On appeal, the State asserts the following points of
 
error: (1) the district court abused its discretion in dismissing
 the complaint with prejudice prior to trial for lack of probable
 cause; and (2) the district court erroneously applied only an
 "intentional" state of mind requirement for the charge of
 terroristic threatening.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant legal authorities, we conclude that the
 district court erred in dismissing the charge against Stover
 prior to trial and we remand to the district court for further
 proceedings. 
We review the district court's pre-trial dismissal of
 
the charge for abuse of discretion. State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw.
 
47, 55, 647 P.2d 705, 711 (1982).
 
The State contends that the district court abused its
 
discretion because it lacked the inherent authority to dismiss
 the charge with prejudice before the presentation of any evidence
 
2(...continued)
(1)	 With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless
disregard of the risk of terrorizing, another
person[.]

 HRS § 707-717 provides
 
[§707-717] Terroristic threatening in the second
degree. (1) A person commits the offense of terroristic
threatening in the second degree if the person commits
terroristic threatening other than as provided in section
707-716.
 
(2) Terroristic threatening in the second degree is a
misdemeanor.

to the trier of fact. The State contends that the authority of
 
the district court to dismiss a charge prior to trial is not a
 broad power, and that if there are questions regarding Stover's
 criminal intent, such issues are for the trier of fact to decide,
 citing State v. Alvey, 67 Haw. 49, 58 n.6, 678 P.2d 5, 11 n.6
 (1984). The State argues that a court must balance "the interest
 of the state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the
 added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court system"
 as provided in State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712. 
Stover responds that the State failed to show a prima 
facie case, that the district court had the inherent power to dismiss the case against him prior to trial, and that he properly brought his motion to dismiss pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12(b). 
Hawaii's appellate courts have recognized that trial 
courts have an inherent authority, within the bounds of duly exercised discretion, to dismiss charges in certain circumstances. See Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 55, 647 P.2d at 711;
4 
State v. Letuli, 99 Hawai 'i 360, 362, 55 P.3d 853, 855 (App. 
2002) ("The district court has the inherent discretion to dismiss criminal cases, civil cases, and traffic offenses, with or without prejudice, for want of prosecution."); State v. Mageo, 78 
4 In Moriwake, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the trial court did
not abuse its discretion in dismissing a manslaughter indictment with
prejudice where there had been two full trials and the juries had been unableto reach a verdict. 65 Haw. at 57, 647 P.2d at 713. The court in Moriwake adopted the following factors for the trial court to consider in balancing therelevant interests to determine whether to dismiss a criminal charge. 
The factors which the trial court should consider in
 undertaking this balance include the following: (1) the
severity of the offense charged; (2) the number of prior
mistrials and the circumstances of the jury deliberation
therein, so far as is known; (3) the character of prior
trials in terms of length, complexity and similarity of
evidence presented; (4) the likelihood of any substantial
difference in a subsequent trial, if allowed; (5) the trial
court's own evaluation of relative case strength; and (6)
the professional conduct and diligence of respective
counsel, particularly that of the prosecuting attorney. 
Id. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712-13.

Hawai'i 33, 38-39, 889 P.2d 1092, 1097-98 (App. 1995) (affirming 
a district court's dismissal of charges after two year delay in 
prosecution and where there was no explanation for the delay). This court has indicated that the Moriwake test is applicable to a district court's dismissal of criminal charges. See Letuli, 99 
Hawai
'i at 362, 55 P.3d at 855 ("[The] balancing test quoted in 
Moriwake is the relevant test."); Mageo, 78 Hawai 'i at 37-38, 889 
P.2d at 1096-97 (holding that the Moriwake test was the applicable test). Thus, the question here is whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the charge with prejudice on the basis of a lack of probable cause. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has indicated that a trial 
judge should not dismiss an otherwise valid indictment prior to the defendant's first trial outside of limited exceptions that are not applicable here. Alvey, 67 Haw. at 57, 678 P.2d at 10. 
In State v. Lincoln, 72 Haw. 480, 825 P.2d 64 (1992), the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court stated that 
Furthermore, in Moriwake as well as in [Alvey], we cautioned
that a trial court's inherent power to dismiss an indictment
is not a broad power and that trial courts must recognize
and weigh the State's interest in prosecuting crime against
fundamental fairness to the defendant. In Moriwake we said,
"we think that the magnitude of the respective interests of
society and of criminal defendants which are implicated in
this area of the law requires that we more fully delineate
the parameters within which this discretion is properly
exercised." 65 Haw. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712. In Alvey we
made clear that, even if "there are serious questions" about
a material element of a crime, it is not within the trial
court's discretion to usurp the function of the trier of
fact before trial. 67 Haw. at 58 n. 6, 678 P.2d at 11 n. 6.
 
. . . It is not for the trial court to weigh the
evidence in determining whether to proceed to trial.
 
72 Haw. at 491, 825 P.2d at 70-71 (emphasis added). The district
 
court here dismissed the misdemeanor charge of terroristic
 threatening prior to Stover's first trial, and prior to Stover
 entering a plea.
5 The dismissal was based on the district
 
5
 HRPP Rule 5(b)(1), which applies to non-felony charges, provides in
pertinent part that "[w]hen the offense is charged by complaint, arraignment
shall be in open court, or by video conference when permitted by Rule 43. The
 
(continued...)

court's determination that the stipulated evidence submitted by
 
6
the parties for the motion to dismiss  did not show Stover
possessed "a specific intent" and therefore, the State lacked

 
probable cause for the charge. However, in order to reach this
 
conclusion, the district court improperly weighed the evidence as
 to a material element of the charged crime prior to any trial in
 this case. 
See Alvey
, 67 Haw. at 58 n.6, 678 P.2d at 11 n.6;
 
Lincoln, 72 Haw. at 491, 825 P.2d at 70-71.
 
Because we conclude that the district court erred for
 
the foregoing reasons, we need not reach the State's other point
 of error.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Defendant's Motion
 to Dismiss With Prejudice" entered on October 3, 2013, in the
 District Court of the Third Circuit, South Kohala Division, is
 vacated and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with
 this opinion.

arraignment shall consist of the reading of the complaint to the defendant and

calling upon the defendant to plead thereto." At the hearing for arraignment
and entry of plea on February 12, 2013, Stover did not enter a plea and
requested to schedule a hearing on his motion to dismiss.

 Although the State stipulated to certain evidence, it also argued
that it was premature for the district court to assess the sufficiency of the
evidence.
