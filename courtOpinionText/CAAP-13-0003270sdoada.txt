Petitioner-Appellant Roy Rita (Rita) appeals from the 
"Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Denying Petitioner 
Roy Rita's [Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40 
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, Filed March 6, 2013" (Order Denying Petition), which was entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Circuit Court)

below, we vacate the Order Denying Petition and remand for
 further proceedings.

I.
 
In 2003, Rita was convicted of continuous sexual
 
assault of a minor under the age of fourteen, in violation of
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-733.5 (Supp. 1997), and was
 sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment. On March 6, 2013,
 Rita filed a "Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" (Petition),
 pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 (2006), that is at issue in this case. 
In his Petition, Rita asserted various grounds for relief
 including: (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (2)
 prosecutorial misconduct; and (3) the trial court's violation of
 his rights to due process and a fair trial. In conjunction with
 his Petition, Rita filed an application for appointment of
 counsel. By order filed on March 6, 2013, the Circuit Court
 granted the application and appointed the Public Defender's
 Office to represent Rita in the HRPP Rule 40 proceedings.
 
Despite the Circuit Court's appointment of counsel, the
 
record indicates that the Public Defender's Office could not
 represent Rita due to a conflict and that Rita was never
 represented by counsel prior to the Circuit Court's filing of its
 Order Denying Petition on July 10, 2013. After Rita, pro se,
 filed a notice of appeal, the Circuit Court appointed private
 counsel, Emmanuel Guerrero, to represent Rita in this appeal. 
II.
 
On appeal, Rita argues that because the Circuit Court 
appointed counsel to represent him in the HRPP Rule 40 proceedings, the Circuit Court erred in entering its Order Denying Petition without affording Rita the benefit of counsel. Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai
'i concedes error and states 
that the Order Denying Petition should be vacated and the case remanded "so that [Rita] may receive the assistance of counsel before disposition of his Rule 40 petition." Under the particular circumstances of this case, and in light of the State's concession of error, we conclude that Rita should have been afforded the benefit of counsel before the Circuit Court entered its Order Denying Petition. We therefore vacate the

Order Denying Petition, and we remand the case for further
 
proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
