SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Javier Fernandez (Fernandez) 
appeals from the Judgment entered on August 19, 2013, in the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).1 Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged Fernandez by felony 
information and non-felony complaint with second-degree assault, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-711(1)(h) (Supp. 2013) (Counts 1 and 2); second-degree terroristic

threatening, in violation of HRS ยง 707-717(1) (1993) (Count 3);
 
and violation of an Order for Protection, in violation of HRS 
ยง 586-11 (2006 & Supp. 2013) (Counts 4, 5, and 6). The Order for
 Protection that Fernandez was charged with violating had been
 issued in favor of his wife, the Petitioner, and his three
 children, Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3. After a jury trial,
 Fernandez was found guilty of Count 5. The Circuit Court granted
 Fernandez's motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count 6, and
 the jury acquitted him of Counts 1 through 4. 
On appeal, Fernandez argues that the Circuit Court
 
committed plain error by giving the jury an instruction which
 "illegally amended Count 5 of the complaint" and was "misleading
 and confusing." The State concedes that the Circuit Court
 committed plain error in instructing the jury on Count 5. As
 explained below, we agree with the State's concession of error.
 
The State charged Fernandez in Count 5 with 
intentionally or knowingly violating the Order for Protection "by threatening or physically abusing the [P]etitioner or anyone living with the [P]etitioner, to wit [Child 1][.]" However, the Circuit Court instructed the jury that the conduct element for Count 5 was established if the jury found that Fernandez violated the Order for Protection "by contacting [Child 1] in a manner prohibited by said order for protection[.]"
2 The State did not 
move to amend Count 5, nor were the requirements for amending the charge satisfied. See Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 7(f) 
(2012). 
The Circuit Court's instruction permitted the jury to
 
find Fernandez guilty of Count 5 based on conduct that was
 significantly different than the conduct alleged in Count 5. We
 conclude that the Circuit Court committed plain error in 
2The Order for Protection prohibited Fernandez from having
any contact with Child 1, except through supervised visitation
and though telephone contact. It also prohibited Fernandez from
threatening or physically abusing the Petitioner or anyone living
with the Petitioner.
