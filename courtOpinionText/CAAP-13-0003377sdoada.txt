 HRS § 291E-61(a) states:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
 
(continued...)

On appeal, Park contends (1) the District Court erred
 
by denying his Motion to Suppress because (a) he was not provided
 
with a Miranda warning when asked if he would submit to a breath,
 blood, or urine test, (b) he was specifically advised that he had
 no right to an attorney, in violation of HRS § 803-9, and (c) a
 biological breath sample was taken without his consent or
 exception to the warrant requirement, in violation of Missouri v.
 McNeely, — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 1552, 185 L. Ed. 2d 696 (2013) and
 (2) the charge was deficient for failing to define the term
 "alcohol."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Park's points of error as follows:
 
(1) A Miranda warning was not required to be given to 
Park before determining whether he would submit to a breath, blood, or urine test. State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 72, 332 P.3d 
661, 674 (App. 2014), cert. granted, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014) (Miranda rights not implicated or violated by the police action in obtaining agreement to submit to a breath test). 
Park was not improperly advised that he was not
 
entitled to an attorney, in violation of HRS § 803-9. Id. at 74,
 
332 P.3d at 676.
 
Park's argument that he did not knowingly and
 
voluntarily consent to a breath test is without merit. Park
 contends that he was coerced into consenting to a breath test
 when he was informed via a preprinted form of the consequences of
 
2(...continued)
(2)	 While under the influence of any drug that
impairs the person's ability to operate the
vehicle in a careful and prudent manner;
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath; or
 
(4)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of
 blood.

refusing to consent to a breath, blood, or urine test prior to 
consenting to a breath test. Park correctly notes that such a warning is not required by HRS § 291E-11 but it is required pursuant to HRS § 291E-15 after a defendant refuses to consent. The language that Park challenges states "However, if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable." Park argues that the warning does not inform a defendant that stated criminal penalties only apply if a defendant is convicted of refusing to consent to a breath, blood, or urine test and that "A lay person may interpret this language to mean that they may have to sit in jail until 30 days have elapsed and/or they have to pay a fine up to $1000 prior to being released." No statute prohibits the police from informing a defendant of the statutory consequences of refusing to consent to a breath, blood, or urine test prior to a defendant's refusal to consent to such a test. The warning is not coercive because it informs a defendant that he or she may be subject "up to" 30 days imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine. In addition, such penalties can only be imposed "if applicable." Thus, the warning does not suggest that imprisonment and/or a fine is automatic upon refusal to consent. Park's reliance upon McNeely is misplaced because "McNeely only addressed the exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood draws, it did not address breath tests or other exceptions to the warrant requirement." Won, 134 Hawai
'i 
at 78, 332 P.3d at 680. McNeely also did not address the 
validity of implied consent statutes. Id. at 80, 332 P.3d at 
682. Since Park consented to a breath test, no warrant or
 
exception to the warrant requirement was needed. 
(2) The definition of "alcohol" was not required to be 
stated in the charge. State v. Turping, — Hawai 'i —, — P.3d —, 
CAAP-13-0002957 2015 WL 792715 at *6 (App. Feb. 25, 2015) petition for cert. filed (Apr. 16, 2015) (SCWC-13-0002957).
