APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(PROBATE NO. 08-1-0192, TRUST NO. 08-1-0094)

 
JULY 31, 2017
 
NAKAMURA, CHIEF JUDGE, AND REIFURTH AND GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAMURA, CHIEF JUDGE
 
Prior to her death in 2008, Ethel Camacho (Ethel)
 
executed wills in 1998, 2000, and 2004. The 1998 will left
 
Ethel's entire estate to her two grandsons, Nephi Daniel Ioane
 Camacho (Nephi) and Moses Antonio Ioane Camacho (Moses), and
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
nominated Nephi as the personal representative, after Ethel's
 
son, the original sole beneficiary of the will, predeceased her
 in 1999. The 2000 and 2004 wills left Ethel's entire estate to
 her daughter, Beverly Calkovsky (Beverly), and nominated Beverly
 as the personal representative. After Ethel's death, Nephi and
 Beverly engaged in a will contest, with Nephi contending that the
 1998 will was Ethel's last validly executed will and Beverly
 contending that either the 2000 will or the 2004 will was the
 last validly executed will. After a trial, the jury found that
 the 2000 will was Ethel's last validly executed will. 
Nephi had retained lawyers who represented him on a
 
contingency fee basis, and because Nephi was unsuccessful in his
 will contest, he apparently was not obligated to pay any
 attorneys' fees to his lawyers. However, it appears that Nephi
 was obligated to pay for litigation costs. Nephi filed a motion
 for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 560:3-720 (2006), which provides:
 
If any personal representative or person nominated as
personal representative defends or prosecutes any proceeding
in good faith, whether successful or not that person is
entitled to receive from the estate that person's necessary
expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorneys'
fees incurred.
 
Nephi requested a total of $345,736.78 in attorneys' fees
 
(including general excise tax) and $42,754.09 in costs to be paid
 by Ethel's estate, which was valued at approximately $1.5 million
 at the time of her death. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1/
(Circuit Court)  granted Nephi's entire request for attorneys'
fees and costs, and it ordered Ethel's estate to pay Nephi's
 lawyers a total of $388,490.87 in legal fees, general excise tax,
 and costs.
 
Beverly appeals from the "First Amended Final Judgment"
 
(Amended Judgment), which entered judgment in favor of Nephi in
 the amount of $388,490.87 for attorneys' fees and costs. The
 
1/ The Honorable Patrick W. Border presided over the proceedings
relevant to this appeal. 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
principal question presented by this appeal is whether under HRS
 
§ 560:3-720, Nephi was entitled to recover attorneys' fees from
 Ethel's estate where Nephi was not obligated to pay his attorneys
 any legal fees because of their contingency fee agreement. As
 explained below, we conclude that the answer to this question is
 "no." We therefore vacate the Amended Judgment to the extent
 that it entered judgment in favor of Nephi and against Ethel's
 estate for attorneys' fees. 
It appears that Nephi was obligated to pay for costs he
 
incurred. We conclude that under HRS § 560:3-720, Nephi was
 entitled to an award of his necessary costs. However, the record
 is insufficient for us to determine whether all the costs
 requested by Nephi were necessary, and we remand the case for
 further proceedings on this issue. 
BACKGROUND
 
I.
 
At the outset, we note that Respondent-Appellant
 
Beverly did not include the trial transcripts as part of the
 record on appeal. This Background Section is therefore based on
 information contained in the pleadings filed by the parties and
 the non-trial transcripts included in the record. 
II. 
Prior to her death in 2008, Ethel owned and lived on
 
real property located on 8th Avenue in Honolulu (the Property). 
The Property contained three dwellings, had a property tax
 assessment value of $1,463,800 in 2008, and was the primary asset
 of Ethel's estate.
 
Beginning in 1998, Nephi and his family lived in one of
 
the dwellings on the Property. On November 2, 1998, Camacho
 executed a "Last Will and Testament of Ethel Camacho" (1998
 Will). The 1998 Will nominated Ethel's son, John F. Camacho, Jr.
 (John), as personal representative and bequeathed Ethel's entire
 estate to John. The 1998 Will also provided that if John
 predeceased Ethel, Nephi would be nominated as personal
 representative, and Ethel's estate would pass equally to Nephi
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Moses. The 1998 Will provided no bequest to Ethel's
 
daughter, Beverly, and it stated, "I have intentionally not
 provided for my other child, Beverly Joyce Calkovsky, as she has
 been adequately been [sic] provided for during my lifetime." 
John passed away in 1999, and therefore, under the 1998 Will,
 Nephi became the person nominated as personal representative, and
 Nephi and Moses became the devisees of Ethel's estate.
 
In 2000, Nephi and his family moved from the Property. 
Beverly and Nephi disagree over the reason for Nephi's moving.
 Beverly asserts that Ethel had a falling out with Nephi and his
 wife and that Ethel asked them to leave. Nephi asserts that
 after signing the 1998 Will, Ethel began exhibiting increasing
 signs of dementia in 1999 and early 2000, including the delusion
 that Nephi and his wife were attempting to poison Ethel, which
 prompted Nephi and his family to leave the Property in 2000.
 
In February 2000, Ethel tore up the 1998 Will and
 
signed a notarized affidavit prepared by her lawyer, Lester
 Oshiro, stating that she intended to die intestate.
 
On July 13, 2000, Ethel executed a "Last Will and
 
Testament of Ethel Camacho" (2000 Will), which revoked all prior
 wills. The 2000 Will nominated Beverly as personal
 representative and bequeathed Ethel's entire estate to Beverly. 
On April 1, 2004, Ethel executed a "Last Will and Testament of
 Ethel Camacho" (2004 Will), which revoked all prior wills. The
 2004 Will, like the 2000 Will, nominated Beverly as personal
 representative and bequeathed Ethel's entire estate to Beverly.
 
On March 3, 2008, Beverly, using a power of attorney
 
granted by Ethel in 2004, created a revocable living trust for
 Ethel (Ethel's Trust), and transferred the Property into Ethel's
 Trust. Ethel's Trust named Beverly as Trustee and provided that
 upon Ethel's death, the trust estate would be distributed to
 Beverly. Ethel passed away on March 13, 2008.
 
III. 
Shortly after Ethel's death, Nephi filed an
 
"Application for Informal Probate of Will and for Informal
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appointment of Personal Representative" (Informal Probate
 
Application). Nephi based his claim for priority of appointment
 as personal representative on his nomination in Ethel's 1998 Will
 and his status as a devisee under that will and an heir of Ethel. 
In the Informal Probate Application, Nephi stated that "[t]o the
 best of [his] knowledge," the 1998 Will was validly executed and
 that "[a]fter exercise of reasonable diligence," he believed the
 1998 Will was Ethel's last will and had not been revoked. On
 April 11, 2008, the Probate Court Registrar informally appointed
 Nephi as personal representative of Ethel's estate. Nephi sent
 notice of his application and appointment as personal
 representative to Beverly.
 
After receiving this notice, Beverly filed objections
 
to Nephi's application and appointment, citing Ethel's 2004 Will,
 which Beverly asserted had "superseded" the 1998 Will. Beverly
 also cited Ethel's Trust.
 
IV.
 
Beverly subsequently filed a petition to set aside and
 
terminate Nephi's appointment as personal representative and to
 have the case transferred from informal probate to formal
 probate. Nephi and Moses filed a response to Beverly's petition. 
Their response alleged, among other things, that "Nephi Camacho
 observed in year 2000 that Ethel had developed profound symptoms
 of dementia which included paranoia, confusion, delusional
 thought which included the belief that neighbors were trying to
 kill her" and that "[d]uring the year 2000, Nephi was told by
 various heath care providers for Ethel that she was suffering
 from progressive dementia." Nephi and Moses also alleged that
 Ethel lacked testamentary capacity when she executed the 2004
 Will; that Beverly exercised undue influence to cause Ethel to
 execute the 2004 Will; that Ethel was mistaken as to the content
 and meaning of the 2004 Will; and that Ethel lacked the capacity
 to contract and grant Beverly a power of attorney. Nephi and 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moses requested that the case be transferred to formal probate;
 
that a jury trial be held to resolve contested matters; that
 Ethel's 1998 Will be admitted to probate; and that Ethel's 2004
 Will, the power of attorney granted to Beverly, Ethel's Trust,
 and the transfer of the Property into Ethel's Trust be declared
 null and void.
2/
 
The Circuit Court found that Beverly's petition
 
constituted a contested matter and transferred it from the
 regular probate calendar to the civil trials calendar. The case
 was set for a jury trial. Prior to trial, Moses was dismissed as
 a party from the case.
 
Beverly's petition and her opposition to Nephi's
 
appointment as personal representative had been based on Ethel's
 2004 Will. However, before the initially scheduled trial date,
 Beverly disclosed that Ethel had executed the 2000 Will. It was
 also disclosed that prior to executing the 2000 Will, Ethel had
 torn up the 1998 Will and signed an affidavit on February 7,
 2000, stating that she intended to die intestate.
 
V.
 
Nephi sought to prove at trial that Ethel's 1998 Will
 
was valid, but that Ethel's subsequent February 7, 2000,
 affidavit, her 2000 Will, and her 2004 Will were all invalid
 because Ethel lacked testamentary capacity when she executed
 them.
3/ The jury found that the 2004 Will was invalid, but that
 
the 2000 Will, which revoked the 1998 Will, was validly executed. 
Because the jury found that the 2000 Will was valid, it was
 instructed that it need not decide whether Ethel had revoked the
 1998 Will by allegedly tearing it up or by signing the February
 7, 2000, affidavit. After the jury returned its verdict, Beverly 
2/ Nephi and Moses also filed a separate petition in a trust proceeding
seeking the same basic relief.
 
3/ Prior to trial, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment for
Beverly with respect to Nephi's claim that Beverly procured the 2004 Will
through undue influence, and Nephi withdrew his claim that Ethel was mistaken
as to the contents of the 2004 Will when she signed it. 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed a petition to probate the 2000 Will and for appointment as

 
personal representative, which was granted by the Circuit Court.
 
VI.
 
After the conclusion of trial, Nephi filed his motion
 
for attorneys' fees and costs. Nephi argued that he defended the
 
1998 Will in good faith and was entitled to reasonable attorneys'
 fees and costs pursuant to HRS § 560:3-720. In total, Nephi
 claimed $388,490.87 in attorneys' fees and costs. Beverly filed
 objections to Nephi's motion for attorneys' fees and costs. 
Among other arguments, Beverly asserted that Nephi was not
 entitled to recover attorneys' fees because he had retained his
 lawyers on a contingency fee basis. To support this assertion,
 Beverly's attorney submitted a declaration stating that "[d]uring
 the course of litigation I personally had a discussion with lead
 [counsel for Nephi] and he informed that [Nephi] had retained
 counsel on a contingency fee basis."
 
The Circuit Court held a hearing on Nephi's motion. 
During the hearing, the Circuit Court stated that "the litigation
 was neither frivolous nor in bad faith. The motion is neither
 frivolous nor in bad faith." After the hearing, the Circuit
 Court issued a written order granting Nephi's motion for
 attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRS § 560:3-720. The
 Circuit Court approved all of the attorneys' fees and costs Nephi
 requested, and it ordered Ethel's estate to pay Nephi's lawyers
 $330,178.75 in legal fees, $15,558.03 in general excise tax, and
 $42,754.09 in costs, for a total award of $388,490.87. On
 September 4, 2013, the Circuit Court filed its Amended Judgment,
 which among other things, entered judgment "in favor of Nephi in
 the amount of $388,490.87 for his attorneys' fees and costs
 incurred[.]" Neither the Circuit Court's written order granting
 Nephi's motion nor the Amended Judgment made findings regarding
 good faith or stated explicit reasons justifying the Circuit
 Court's award. Beverly appeals from the Amended Judgment.

DISCUSSION
 
I.
 
A.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 560:3-720, the Circuit Court granted
 
Nephi's request that Ethel's estate pay $345,736.78 in attorneys'
 fees (including general excise tax) and $42,754.09 in costs for
 Nephi's unsuccessful will contest. HRS § 560:3-720 provides:
 
If any personal representative or person nominated as
personal representative defends or prosecutes any proceeding
in good faith, whether successful or not that person is
entitled to receive from the estate that person's necessary
expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorneys'
fees incurred.
 
On appeal, Beverly raises numerous challenges to the
 
Circuit Court's decision to grant Nephi's request for attorneys'
 
fees and costs.4/ With respect to attorneys' fees, we conclude
 
that the pivotal claim raised by Beverly is that HRS § 560:3-720
 does not authorize an award of attorneys' fees to Nephi because,
 based on his contingency fee arrangement, Nephi was not obligated
 to pay attorneys' fees to his attorneys for his unsuccessful will
 contest. We hold that HRS § 560:3-720 does not authorize the
 award of attorneys' fees from the estate to a nominated personal
 representative who is unsuccessful in a will contest and who is
 
4/ Beverly asserts eleven points of error: (1) the Circuit Court erred
by failing to state the statutory basis for its award of attorneys' fees and
costs, find that Nephi acted in good faith, or address Beverly's objections tothe fees and costs as unauthorized and excessive; (2) Nephi lacked good faithto initiate or persist in his will contest; (3) HRS § 560:3-720 does not applyto personal representatives who unsuccessfully attack a will for personal gainand do not benefit the estate; (4) HRS § 560:3-720 does not apply to personalrepresentatives who unsuccessfully challenge a will and owe nothing to theirlawyers under a contingency fee agreement; (5) HRS § 560:3-720 is limited tofees incurred under HRS Chapter 560:3 and does not apply to trust litigationbrought under HRS Chapter 560:7; (6) assuming HRS § 560:3-720 authorized thefees requested by Nephi, he did not comply with Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR)
Rule 40-42 or Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) Rule 1.5; (7)
assuming the fees requested by Nephi were authorized, he failed to providesufficient evidence of his lawyers' reputations, training, or experience forthe Circuit Court to determine their reasonable hourly rate; (8) assuming thefees requested by Nephi were authorized, the Circuit Court lacked sufficientbilling information to determine whether the requested fees were reasonable;(9) the fees requested by Nephi were excessive, duplicative, and unreasonable;
(10) assuming the costs requested by Nephi were authorized, the request did
not comply with HRS § 607-9 or HPR Rule 40-42, or were not sufficiently
documented; and (11) the request for costs included costs that were not
recoverable.
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not obligated to pay attorneys' fees because his or her attorneys
 
were retained on a contingency fee basis. 
With respect to costs, it appears that unlike
 
attorneys' fees, Nephi was obligated to pay for costs incurred. 
We hold that under HRS § 560:3-720, Nephi was entitled to an
 award of his necessary costs. However, we remand the case for
 further proceedings regarding whether cost items requested by
 Nephi, and objected to by Beverly, were necessary. 
B.
 
Our resolution of this appeal turns on the 
interpretation of HRS § 560:3-720. Statutory interpretation is a question of law that is subject to de novo review. Hawaii Gov't 
Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME Local 152, AFL–CIO v. Lingle, 124 Hawai
'i 
197, 201–02, 239 P.3d 1, 5–6 (2010). We are guided by the following principles in construing a statute: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguous
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.
 
Id. at 202, 239 P.3d at 6 (internal block quote format and
 
citation omitted). 
C.
 
Assuming that the good faith requirement of HRS 
§ 560:3-720 has been satisfied, HRS § 560:3-720 requires the
 estate to pay a person who is a personal representative or is
 nominated as a personal representative "that person's necessary
 expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorneys' fees
 incurred." Based on the language of the statute itself, we 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
construe HRS § 560:3-720 as only requiring the estate to pay
 
attorneys' fees and costs that a personal representative or
 nominated personal representative is obligated to pay. When a
 personal representative or nominated personal representative is
 not obligated to pay attorneys' fees or costs, such fees or costs
 are not "necessary expenses and disbursements" and are not "fees
 [or costs] incurred" by the personal representative or nominated
 personal representative.
 
Our interpretation of HRS § 560:3-720 is supported by 
our construction of similar statutory language in Vinson v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Sands of Kahana, 130 Hawai
'i 540, 312 P.3d 
1247 (App. 2013). In Vinson, we construed HRS § 514B-157(b) (2006), which requires the award of "all reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred" by a condominium owner who prevails in an action to enforce any provision of HRS Chapter 514B against a condominium association. We held that "in order for Vinson [(the condominium owner)] to have 'incurred' attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 514B–157(b), he must have paid or be legally obligated to pay such fees and costs[.]" 
5/
Vinson, 130 Hawai 'i at 548-49, 312 P.3d at 1255-56.  We 
therefore concluded that the trial court erred in awarding Vinson legal fees paid by third-parties that Vinson was not legally obligated to pay. 
Id. Consistent with 
Vinson, we conclude that 
for a personal representative or nominated personal representative to have "incurred" attorneys' fees or costs under HRS § 560:3-720, he or she must be legally obligated to pay such fees or costs. 
5/ In Vinson, we noted that "Black's Law Dictionary defines 'incur' to
mean 'to suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).'" Vinson, 130 
Hawai'i at 548, 312 P.3d at 1255. We also cited case law construing a statute
authorizing reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing party as not permitting
the prevailing party to receive a windfall, but permitting the prevailingparty to be awarded attorneys' fees if he could show he was "'legallyobligated'" to pay his attorneys, the Legal Aid Society of Hawai' i, the fees
he recovered. Id. (citing Wiginton v. Pac. Credit Corp., 2 Haw. App. 435,
446-47, 634 P.2d 111, 120 (1981)). 
10

II.
 
A.
 
We first address the Circuit Court's award of 
attorneys' fees. 
Beverly asserts, and Nephi does not dispute, 
that Nephi retained his lawyers on a contingency fee basis. 
Although the fee agreement between Nephi and his lawyers is not part of the record, generally, a contingent fee agreement is "'a fee agreement under which the attorney will not be paid unless the client is successful.'" Lopez v. State, 133 Hawai
'i 311, 
327-28, 328 P.3d 320, 336-37 (2014) (Acoba, J., dissenting) (quoting Robert L. Rossi, Attorneys' Fees § 2:1); see also Black's Law Dictionary 362 (9th ed. 2009) (defining "contingent fee" as "[a] fee charged for a lawyer's services only if the lawsuit is successful or is favorably settled out of court"). A contingency fee is usually calculated as a stipulated percentage of the client's recovery in the event of a successful prosecution of the action. Rossi, Attorney's Fees § 2:1; Black's Law Dictionary 362 ("Contingent fees are [usually] calculated as a percentage of the client's net recovery[.]"). Here, Beverly asserts, and Nephi does not dispute, that because Nephi retained his lawyers on a contingency fee basis, Nephi "owed his lawyers nothing" when he did not prevail in his will contest. 
Accordingly, for purposes of our analysis on appeal, we
 
assume that Nephi had a standard contingency fee agreement with
 his lawyers, one that provided that Nephi was not obligated to
 pay his lawyers any attorneys' fees if Nephi was unsuccessful in
 his will contest. Based on such a contingency fee agreement,
 because Nephi did not prevail in his will contest, he was not
 legally obligated to pay his lawyers any attorneys' fees. 
Therefore, under HRS § 560:3-720, Nephi was not entitled to have
 Ethel's estate pay for attorneys' fees that he was not obligated
 to pay his lawyers. 
We conclude that a contrary interpretation of HRS 
§ 560:3-720 would create improper windfall situations at the
 expense of the estate. HRS § 560:3-720 provides for the personal
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
representative or nominated personal representative, and not his
 
or her lawyers, to receive from the estate the amounts awarded
 for attorneys' fees and costs. Here, an award to Nephi of
 $345,736.78 for attorney's fees he is not obligated to pay would
 result in an improper windfall to him; it would produce the
 anomalous result of Nephi obtaining a significant portion of 
Ethel's estate despite the jury's determination that Ethel
 validly intended that he should receive none of her estate. 
Even if Nephi is ordered to pay the fee amount awarded
 
to him to his lawyers, an action HRS § 560:3-720 does not
 specifically authorize or require, it would result in a windfall
 to Nephi's lawyers. By taking the case on a contingency fee
 basis, Nephi's lawyers conditioned their entitlement to receive
 their fees on their successful prosecution of Nephi's will
 contest and, in doing so, presumably factored in the possibility
 and assumed the risk that Nephi would not prevail in setting the
 level of their contingency fee. Having conditioned their
 entitlement to fees on Nephi's prevailing in his will contest,
 Nephi's lawyers would receive a windfall if despite Nephi's
 failure to prevail, Ethel's estate was nevertheless required to
 pay Nephi's lawyers for their legal fees.
 
These windfall scenarios reinforce our view that HRS 
§ 560:3-720 does not require an estate to pay for attorneys' fees
 a personal representative or nominated personal representative is
 not obligated to pay because he or she retained lawyers on a
 contingency fee basis and was not successful in prosecuting or
 defending a will contest. 
B.
 We note that HRS § 560:3-720 is a provision that comes 
from the model Uniform Probate Code that was largely adopted by the Hawai
'i Legislature. See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 77, in 1996 
Senate Journal, at 773. We can look to other jurisdictions that have adopted statutes with the same or similar language as HRS § 560:3-720 for guidance. Unfortunately, the case law from other jurisdictions addressing the contingency fee issue presented by 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
this case is sparse, and the jurisdictions that have addressed
 
this issue are split. 
Our interpretation of HRS § 560:3-720 is supported by
 
Russell v. Moeling , 526 S.W.2d 533 (Tex. 1975). Russell involved
 
a contest between a 1965 will and a 1969 will, in which the 1969
 will was eventually found to be valid and admitted to probate. 
Russell, 526 S.W.2d at 534. The unsuccessful executrix of the
 1965 will, who had hired her attorneys on a contingency fee
 basis, applied for attorneys' fees and expenses pursuant to
 Section 243 of the Texas Probate Code, which contained language
 that closely matches the operative language of HRS § 560:3-720. 
Id. at 534-35. Section 243 stated:
 
When any person designated as executor in a will, or as
administrator with the will annexed, defends it or
prosecutes any proceeding in good faith, and with just
cause, for the purpose of having the will admitted to
probate, whether successful or not, he shall be allowed out
of the estate his necessary expenses and disbursements,
including reasonable attorney's fees, in such proceedings.
 
Id. at 535 (emphasis added). 
The Texas Supreme Court held that because the
unsuccessful executrix of the 1965 will, by virtue of her
 
contingency fee agreement, did not owe her attorneys any legal
 fees, Section 243 did not authorize the recovery of the requested
 attorneys' fees from the estate. The court reasoned as follows:
 

 
The import of [Section 243] is clear: the executor or
administrator "shall be allowed out of the estate his
 necessary expenses and disbursements." The purpose then is
to pay the cost of attorney's fees that are owed by the
executor or administrator, and the allowance is not to the
attorney, but to the administrator. We are presented here,
however, with a situation where the unsuccessful executrix
of the 1965 will and her attorneys had entered into a
contingent fee agreement which provided that if the probate
of the 1965 will was successful, the attorneys were to
receive a percentage of all moneys they recovered. The
 [1965] will was not probated and therefore the executrix
named therein was not faced with any expense for the legal
work that had been done since nothing was recovered.
Consequently, under the terms of Section 243, the estate
could not be held liable for those attorneys' fees.
 
Id. (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In accordance with the
 
Texas Supreme Court, we conclude that the import and purpose of
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 560:3-720 is clear -- to require the estate to pay for
 
attorneys' fees, but only those fees that are actually owed by
 the personal representative or nominated personal representative. 
Indeed, this import and purpose of HRS § 560:3-720 is even
 clearer than the Texas statute, given HRS 560:3-720's reference
 to "reasonable attorney's fees incurred." (Emphasis added.)
 
Nephi cites cases from other jurisdictions construing
 
statutes with language close or somewhat similar to HRS § 560:3­720 which have held that unsuccessful will contestants were
 entitled to recover attorneys' fees even though (or regardless of
 whether) their attorneys were hired on a contingency fee basis. 
E.g. In re Estate of Robinson, 690 P.2d 1383, 1389 (Kan. 1984)
 ("An individual, by entering into a contingent fee contract, does
 not control the award of attorney fees under the statute[.]");
 Fickle v. Scampmorte, 183 N.E.2d 838, 840 (Ind. 1962) ("The
 statute places the obligation on the estate to pay the attorney
 fees and expenses that are normally required in a proceeding to
 probate a purported will if the proceedings are in good faith. 
This statute is not conditional upon any outside or private
 agreement."); In re Estate of Whitehead, 287 So.2d 9, 10 (Fla.
 1973) ("[T]he attorneys' fees herein ordered paid were payable
 initially on a contingent basis, but the materialization of the
 contingency is not a prerequisite to the ordering of payment of
 attorneys' fees[.]").
 
We note that there is a dissenting opinion in Robinson,
 
which states that the result of the majority's decision can be to
 create a windfall, and a dissenting opinion in Fickle, which
 asserts that because the unsuccessful will contestant was not
 liable for attorneys' fees under his contingency fee agreement,
 the attorneys' fees requested were not a necessary expense. 
Robinson, 690 P.2d at 1390 (McFarland, J., dissenting); Fickle,
 183 N.E.2d at 841-42 (Bobbitt, J., dissenting). In any event, we
 are not persuaded by the majority decisions in the cases cited by
 Nephi and believe that our interpretation of HRS § 560:3-720 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conforms to the statutory language and Hawai 'i precedents and 
reflects a more reasoned approach. 
C.
 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that HRS § 560:3­
720 did not authorize the Circuit Court to order Ethel's estate
 
to pay attorneys' fees that Nephi, by virtue of his contingency
 fee agreement, did not owe his lawyers and was not legally
 obligated to pay.
6/ We therefore vacate the Amended Judgment to
 
the extent that it entered judgment in favor of Nephi and against
 Ethel's estate for attorneys' fees.
 
III.
 
We now turn to the question of the Circuit Court's
 
award of costs. Nephi was not the prevailing party in the will
 contest, and therefore, his request for costs was also based on 
HRS § 560:3-720. As noted, Nephi's fee agreement with his
 lawyers is not part of the record, but Beverly did not challenge
 Nephi's request for costs on the ground that he was not legally
 obligated to pay for costs. In addition, Nephi asserts, without
 contradiction, that he "had to borrow funds to pay for the costs
 incurred." Thus, it appears that Nephi satisfied the requirement
 under HRS § 560:3-720 of having the obligation to pay for the
 costs for which he sought reimbursement from Ethel's estate.
 
A.
 
Beverly, however, contends that Nephi failed to satisfy
 
other conditions which she claims were necessary for Nephi to
 recover under HRS § 560:3-720. In particular, Beverly contends
 that Nephi did not act in good faith in pursuing the will
 contest. She also contends that Nephi was not entitled to
 recovery under HRS § 560:3-720 because (1) he did not prevail in
 the will contest and therefore his actions did not benefit
 Ethel's estate and (2) he was a primary beneficiary of the 1998 
6/ In light of our analysis and resolution of the contingency fee issue,
we need not address the other grounds raised by Beverly in contending that
Nephi should not have been awarded attorneys' fees under HRS § 560:3-720.
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Will that he sought to validate in the will contest. These
 
contentions of Beverly are without merit.
 
1.
 
The Circuit Court found that Nephi acted in good faith
 
in pursing the will contest. At the hearing on Nephi's request
 for attorneys' fees and costs, the Circuit Court stated that "the
 litigation was neither frivolous nor in bad faith. [Nephi's]
 motion [for attorneys' fees and costs] is neither frivolous nor
 in bad faith." Moreover, at a hearing on Beverly's motion to
 have Nephi pay her attorney's fees and costs on the ground that
 Nephi's pursuit of the will contest was frivolous, the Circuit
 Court found that each party was "firm in their belief of the
 rightness of their respective causes," and it further found that
 "this litigation was undertaken by both sides in good faith."
7/
  
"Generally, the existence of good faith . . . is a fact 
question for the trial court to determine." In re Estate of 
Herbert, 91 Hawai 'i 107, 109, 979 P.2d 1133, 1135 (1999) 
(internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). We find no basis to overturn the Circuit Court's determination that Nephi acted in good faith in pursuing the will contest. In this 
7/ In its order denying Beverly's motion to have Nephi pay Beverly's
attorneys' fees and costs, the Circuit Court stated: 
I have presided over pretrial motions as well as the trial
of this matter. I have had the opportunity to witness the
testimonies and cross examinations of the parties and to evaluate
each side's respective claims, as well as each side's reaction to
the other side's claims and conduct throughout the course of this
period. 
With this wealth of background, I conclude that the behavior
of each party is one of mutual suspicion and understandable but
regrettable hostility. Each side believes that the other has
 manipulated and/or misrepresented the intent of the decedent for
the purpose of achieving financial gain. 
Even in this atmosphere of mutual acrimony I find each party
to be firm in their belief of the rightness of their respective
causes, and each to possess meritorious and indeed likeable
character traits. 
Taking all these factors into account, I find that this
litigation was undertaken by both sides in good faith.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
16

regard, we note that Beverly failed to include the trial 
transcripts as part of the record on appeal. Without the trial transcripts, Beverly cannot satisfy her "burden of demonstrating error in the record" with respect to the Circuit Court's determination that Nephi acted in good faith. State v. Hoang, 93 
Hawai
'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) ("[W]e will not presume 
error from a silent record."). Moreover, the record that was provided supports the view that Nephi had good faith reasons for challenging the 2000 Will and 2004 Will. The record contains medical records and other evidence that Ethel suffered from dementia and which raised questions about her testamentary capacity. While the jury ultimately found the 2000 Will to be valid, it agreed with Nephi that Ethel lacked the testamentary capacity to execute the 2004 Will. 
2.
 
We reject Beverly's contentions that Nephi was not
 
entitled to recovery of costs under HRS § 560:3-720: (1) because
 he did not prevail in the will contest and therefore his actions
 did not benefit Ethel's estate; and (2) because of his status as
 a primary beneficiary of the 1998 Will. 
HRS § 560:3-720 entitles a nominated personal
 
representative who pursues a will contest in good faith to
 recover his or her necessary costs "whether successful or not" in
 the will contest. Therefore, the fact that Nephi was
 unsuccessful in the will contest does not disqualify him from
 recovering costs under HRS § 560:3-720. 
Beverly's claim that Nephi's status as a primary
 
beneficiary of the 1998 Will precludes his recovery of costs is
 without merit. HRS § 560:3-720 does not limit recovery to
 personal representatives or nominated personal representatives
 who are not beneficiaries of the will they sought to prove was
 valid. We conclude that if a personal representative or
 nominated personal representative pursues a will contest in good 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
faith, his or her status as a beneficiary of the argued-for will
 
does not render him or her ineligible from recovering under HRS 
§ 560:3-720. 
B.
 
Beverly challenges the reasonableness and amount of 
cost items awarded by the Circuit Court. Generally, unless there is a specific objection to a cost item, the court should approve the item. Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 
Hawai
'i 292, 307, 972 P.2d 295, 310 (1999). However, when 
objections have been filed to specific costs items requested, the burden of proving the correctness of the items shifts to the party claiming them. Id. 
Here, Beverly filed extensive objections to the cost 
items requested by Nephi. Beverly challenged the costs requested by Nephi on the grounds that they were unnecessary, insufficiently documented, or unrecoverable. The items of cost challenged by Beverly included messenger fees, courier services, Westlaw charges, and other charges related to the filing and delivery of documents that ordinarily do not appear to be recoverable as costs. See Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 Hawai
'i 204, 
212-13, 130 P.3d 1069, 1077-78 (App. 2006); Bjornen v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 81 Hawai
'i 105, 107, 912 P.2d 602, 604 (App. 
1996). Nephi did not specifically respond to Beverly's objections or provide documentation supporting items that Beverly asserted lacked sufficient documentation. The Circuit Court granted Nephi's cost request in total, without addressing Beverly's objections or otherwise explaining its decision. 
Under these circumstances, we vacate the Circuit
 
Court's cost award and remand for further proceedings. On
 remand, Nephi may submit additional evidence or justification
 with respect to the costs objected to by Beverly. We also direct
 the Circuit Court to explain its rulings on Beverly's cost
 objections in sufficient detail to permit effective appellate
 review.

CONCLUSION
 
We vacate the Amended Judgment to the extent that it
 
entered judgment in favor of Nephi for attorneys' fees and costs
 
to be paid by Ethel's estate, and we remand the case for further
 proceedings consistent with this Opinion.
