by: 	(1) denying two motions to suppress evidence regarding his

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) states:

breath test because (a) he was not provided with a Miranda3
 
warning when asked if he would submit to testing, (b) he was
 
denied the right to counsel in violation of HRS § 803-9 (2014)
 when he was advised that he had no right to an attorney, (c) a
 biological breath sample was taken without his consent or an
 exception to the warrant requirement, in violation of Missouri v.
 McNeely, 133 S. Ct. 1552 (2013); and (2) the District Court
 improperly took judicial notice of the Intoxilyzer supervisor's
 sworn statements.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Gladman's
 points of error as follows and affirm.
 
(1) The District Court did not err in denying
 
Gladman's motions to suppress.
 
(a) A Miranda warning to Gladman was not required 
before determining whether he would submit to a breath, blood, or urine test. State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 72, 332 P.3d 661, 674 
(App. 2014), cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2014 WL 2881259 (June 24, 2014). 
(b) Gladman was not improperly advised that he was
 
not entitled to an attorney in violation of HRS § 803-9. Id. at
 
74, 332 P.3d at 676.
 
(c) Gladman's argument that he did not knowingly
 
and voluntarily consent to a breath test is without merit. 
Gladman contends that he was coerced into consenting to a breath
 test when he was informed via a preprinted form of the
 consequences of refusing to consent to a breath, blood, or urine
 test prior to consenting to a breath test. Gladman correctly
 notes that such a warning is not required by HRS § 291E-11
 (2007), but it is required pursuant to HRS § 291E-15 (Supp. 2014)
 after a defendant refuses to consent. The language that Gladman
 challenges follows the statement advising inter alia that testing
 may be refused and provides: "However, if you refuse to submit
 
3

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up to
 
thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the
 sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable." Gladman argues that the
 warning does not inform a defendant that the stated criminal
 penalties only apply if a defendant is convicted of refusing to
 consent to a breath, blood, or urine test and that "[a] lay
 person may interpret this language to mean that they may have to
 sit in jail until 30 days have elapsed and/or they have to pay a
 fine up to $1000 prior to being released." No statute prohibits
 the police from informing a defendant of the statutory
 consequences of refusing to consent to a breath, blood, or urine
 test prior to a defendant's refusal to consent to such a test. 
The warning is not coercive because it informs a defendant that
 he or she is "subject to up to" 30 days imprisonment and/or a
 $1,000 fine. In addition, such penalties can only be imposed "if
 applicable." The warning does not suggest that imprisonment
 and/or a fine is automatic upon refusal to consent. 
Further, Gladman's reliance upon McNeely is misplaced 
because "McNeely only addressed the exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood draws; it did not address breath tests or other exceptions to the warrant requirement." Won, 134 Hawai
'i at 78, 332 P.3d at 680. 
McNeely also did not address the validity of implied consent statutes. Id. at 80, 332 P.3d at 682. Since Gladman consented 
to a breath test, no warrant or exception to the warrant requirement was needed. 
(2) Gladman's final point of error is that the District 
Court erred in taking judicial notice of two Intoxilyzer supervisor's sworn statements regarding accuracy tests of the intoxilyzer utilized in administering Gladman's breath test. Under the circumstances of this case, even if the District Court erred in taking judicial notice of the Intoxilyzer supervisor's sworn statements under Rule 201 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence, such error was harmless. See Rule 52 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Penal Procedure ("Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."). The record establishes that the deputy prosecuting attorney 
3

showed the two sworn statements to Gladman's counsel during trial
 
and, although Gladman's counsel objected to the District Court
 taking judicial notice of the sworn statements, Gladman's counsel
 acknowledged that the sworn statements could be admitted into
 evidence and did not challenge any other aspect of the sworn
 statements or the accuracy of the breath test.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on
 August 22, 2013 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Wahiaw
a Division, is affirmed.
