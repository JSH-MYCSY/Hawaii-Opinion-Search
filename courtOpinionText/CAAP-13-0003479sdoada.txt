STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
RICHARD C. REILLY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(Case No. 1DTA-13-00739)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Richard C. Reilly (Reilly) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on August 20, 2013 in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).

Reilly was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(4) (Supp. 2014).

On appeal, Reilly contends the District Court erred by
 
denying his Motion to Suppress because (1) he was not provided

 HRS § 291E-61(a) states:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:

with a Miranda  warning when asked if he would submit to a
breath, blood, or urine test, (2) he was specifically advised
 
that he had no right to an attorney, in violation of HRS § 803-9
 (2014), and (3) a blood sample was taken without a warrant,
 without an exception to the warrant requirement, in violation of
 his Fourth Amendment rights and Missouri v. McNeely, — U.S. —,
 133 S. Ct. 1552, 185 L. Ed. 2d 696 (2013), and the blood sample
 was taken without valid consent.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Reilly's points of error as follows:
 
(1) A Miranda warning was not required to be given to 
Reilly before determining whether he would submit to a breath, blood, or urine test. State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 72-74, 332 
P.3d 661, 674-76 (App. 2014), cert. granted, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014) (Miranda rights not implicated or violated by the police in presenting implied consent form to determine if arrestee will submit to testing). 
(2) Reilly was not improperly advised when he was told
 
that he was not entitled to an attorney, in violation of HRS
 § 803-9. Id. at 74, 332 P.3d at 676. 
(3) Reilly's reliance on McNeely is misplaced because
 
McNeely resolved "a split of authority on the question whether
 the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream establishes
 a per se exigency that suffices on its own to justify an
 exception to the warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood
 testing in drunk-driving investigations." McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at
 
1558 (emphasis added). In this case, Reilly consented to take a
 blood test. However, Reilly contends that his consent was
 coerced due to the language of the implied consent form which he
 signed, and therefore, his consent was invalid. Reilly claims
 the following specific language in the consent form was coercive:

 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

However, if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or
urine test, you shall be subject to up to thirty days
imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of
291E-65, if applicable. In addition, you shall also be
subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E,
part III.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 291E-15 (Supp. 2014), if a defendant
 
refuses to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, they must be
 
advised of the statutory consequences in HRS § 291E-41, 291E-65,
 291E-68, and if the person still refuses, that sanctions under
 HRS Chapter 291E part III or HRS § 291E-65 may apply. However,
 no statute prohibits the police from informing a defendant of the
 statutory consequences of refusing to consent to a breath, blood,
 or urine test prior to a defendant's refusal to consent to such a
 test. The warning is not coercive because it informs a defendant
 that he or she shall be subject "up to" 30 days imprisonment
 and/or a $1,000 fine. In addition, such penalties can only be
 imposed "if applicable." Thus, the warning does not suggest that
 imprisonment and/or a fine is automatic upon refusal to consent. 
Reilly consented to provide a blood sample, thus, McNeely is
 inapplicable and his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on August 20,
 2013 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division is affirmed.
