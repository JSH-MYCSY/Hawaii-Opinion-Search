ROYNES JOSEPH DURAL, II, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P.P. No. 09-1-0015 (CR. NO. 02-1-2791)
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)1
On March 5, 2018, Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai# i
(State) filed a "Motion for Clarification of the Court's
Memorandum Opinion" ( Motion for Clarification ).  On March 9,
2018, Petitioner-Appellant Roynes Joseph Dural, II, filed a
memorandum in opposition to the Motion for Clarification.  The
State asserts that it seeks to clarify "whether this Court's
intention was to vacate and remand for a new trial, or vacate and
remand to the trial court for determination of whether the newly
discovered evidence satisfies the four-part test set forth in
People v. Cress , 468 Mich. 678, 664 N.W.2d 50, 17[4] (Mich.
1Chief Judge Craig H. Nakamura was a member of the merit
panel when the Memorandum Opinion in this case was filed, but he
retired effective March 1, 2018.  Associate Judge Lisa M. Ginoza
was assigned to the merit panel on March 12, 2018.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2003)."  
It is clear from our Memorandum Opinion that we
remanded the case for a new trial, and not for the trial court to
determine whether a new trial should be granted.  We specifically
stated:  "[W]e conclude that Dural presented newly discovered
evidence that warranted a new trial and that the Circuit Court
abused its discretion in denying his request for a new trial." 
Dural v. State , No. CAAP-13-0003694, 2018 WL 1063886, at *3
(Hawai#i App. Feb. 27, 2018). 
Because it is clear from our Memorandum Opinion that we
remanded the case for a new trial, we conclude that the
clarification requested by the State is unnecessary.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State's
Motion for Clarification is denied.
