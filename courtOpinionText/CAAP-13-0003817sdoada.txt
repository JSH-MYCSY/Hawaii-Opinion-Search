STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JESSE CARTER LAY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0340)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Jessie Carter Lay (Lay) filed an
 
appeal from the "Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence"
 
(Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit
 (Circuit Court).
1 Lay was convicted of second-degree negligent
 
injury and driving under the influence of an intoxicant.
 
Lay died while his appeal was pending, and his counsel
 
filed a "Suggestion of Death." On August 15, 2016, this court
 issued an order seeking the position of each party regarding
 further proceedings in this case in light of the Suggestion of
 Death. In response, Lay's counsel stated that after consulting
 with representatives of Lay's estate, Lay's counsel does not
 intend to file a motion for substitution of party. The Circuit
 Court's Judgment did not include an order of restitution, and
 
1The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

Lay's counsel represented that as the result of the settlement of
 
a civil lawsuit, there was no issue of restitution in Lay's
 criminal case. Lay's counsel recommended that this court dismiss
 the appeal as moot, vacate the Judgment, and dismiss the
 underlying criminal case. 
In its response to our order, Plaintiff-Appellee State 
of Hawai
'i (State) asserted that there is no restitution owing in 
the underlying criminal case. The State further stated that it does not oppose dismissal of the appeal and the underlying criminal case. 
In light of Lay's death while his appeal was pending, 
and since no motion for substitution of party has been filed by any party, there is no restitution order at issue, and the State does not oppose dismissal of the underlying criminal case, we exercise our discretion to dismiss the appeal as moot, vacate the Judgment, and dismiss the underlying criminal case. See State v. 
Makaila, 79 Hawai
'i 40, 45, 897 P.2d 967, 972 (1995). 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed as moot, the Circuit Court's Judgment filed on October
 3, 2013, is vacated, and the indictment against Lay in this case
 is dismissed.
