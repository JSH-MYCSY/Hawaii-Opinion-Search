IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I  
DARLENE GRACE BACULPO, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
RODNEY BACULPO, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 08-1-0063)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Chan, J.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On July 13, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellant Darlene Grace
 
Baculpo (Appellant) filed in the underlying case, FC-D No. 08-1­0063, a notice indicating she had filed a bankruptcy petition in
 the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, case
 number 10-02010, and the proceedings were stayed, pursuant to 11
 U.S.C. § 362(a) (2010);
 
(2)
 On May 11, 2011, Defendant-Appellee Rodney Baculpo
 
(Appellee) filed in the underlying case a bankruptcy court order
 modifying the automatic stay to permit the family court to
 determine the nature and extent of Appellant's interest in the
 Uluwai Street property, but maintaining the stay as to any
 disposition of the property;
 
(3) On November 15, 2017, the court ordered the parties
 
to notify the court about the status of Appellant's bankruptcy
 case, and to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed
 for failure to prosecute;

(4) On November 20, 2017, Appellee's counsel, Douglas
 
L. Halsted (Halsted), filed a response to the November 15, 2017
 
order and order to show cause, indicating, among other things,
 the bankruptcy court entered a final decree in Appellant's
 bankruptcy case on June 7, 2016, but he did not have a copy of
 the decree;
 
(5) Appellant did not file a response to the 
November 15, 2017 order and order to show cause;
 
(6) On February 14, 2018, the court ordered Halsted to 
file certified copies of the appropriate bankruptcy court documents indicating the stay in Appellant's bankruptcy case had been vacated, modified, lifted, or terminated, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy court's June 7, 2016 final decree. Because it appeared Appellant's counsel, Lionel M. Riley (Riley), is deceased, and it was unclear when Riley passed away, whether he received the November 15, 2017 order and order to show cause, or whether Appellant knew her appeal could be dismissed, the court ordered the appellate clerk to mail a copy of the November 15, 2017 order and order to show cause and the February 14, 2018 order to Riley's physical addresses on file in this case and with the Hawaii State Bar Association, and Appellant at her last known physical address in the record on appeal. The court also ordered that within fifteen days from the order, Appellant shall update her contact information with the court, consistent with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
25(f), and file a response to the November 15, 2017 order to show cause. The court cautioned Appellant that failure to timely comply with the order could result in sanctions; 
(7) That same day, the appellate clerk mailed copies of
 
the November 15, 2017 order and order to show cause, and the
 February 14, 2018 order to Riley and Appellant, as directed in
 the February 14, 2018 order;
 
(8) On February 20, 2018, Halsted filed a certified
 
copy of the bankruptcy court's June 7, 2016 final decree,
 indicating Appellant's bankruptcy estate had been fully

administered, and the bankruptcy case is closed; and
 
(9) Because Appellant's bankruptcy case is closed, the
 
automatic stay in this appeal is terminated. The United States
 
Postal Service returned the envelopes containing the orders that
 the appellate clerk mailed to Riley as undeliverable, but did not
 return the envelopes containing the orders mailed to Appellant. 
Appellant did not file a response to the November 15, 2017 order
 to show cause, as directed in the February 14, 2018 order, and
 took no further action in this appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
