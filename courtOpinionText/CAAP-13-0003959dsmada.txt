IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
DAVID CURTIS HOPPMANN and WENDY PAMELA HOPPMANN,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-1770-08)
 
ORDER GRANTING THE JANUARY 31, 2014
STIPULATED MOTION FOR VOLUNTARILY DISMISSAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the "Stipulated Motion for
 
Voluntary Dismissal” of the appeal (Motion) filed on January 31,
 
2014 by Defendants-Appellants David Curtis Hoppmann and Wendy
 Pamela Hoppmann, and the records and files herein, it appears
 that the Motion mistakenly references as its basis the “Federal
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b)” rather than the Hawai 'i Rule 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b); however the intent of 
the Motion to dismiss the appeal with the parties to bear their own appellate costs and fees is nevertheless clear, and the parties may move for reconsideration consistent with the time frame and parameters of HRAP Rule 40 if their intent is otherwise. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is granted, and
 
the appeal is dismissed. The parties shall bear their own
 appellate costs and fees.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
