SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment), entered on September 11, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit, K
ane'ohe Division (District 
Court).1 After a bench trial, the District Court found Pavlick

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides:

 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:

 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]

On appeal, Pavlick argues3
 that the District Court
 
erred in convicting him based on insufficient evidence because

 
"[r]easonable suspicion and probable cause is not proof beyond a

 reasonable doubt[.]"

 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we

 resolve Pavlick's points of error as follows.

 
Officer Sherman Dowkin (Office Dowkin) testified that

 
he saw Pavlick's vehicle straddling the solid white line

 separating the shoulder and right lane, and weaving within the

 lane. 
While the officer drove after Pavlick, Pavlick continued

 
to weave in and out of the lane. The officer "pace clock[ed]"

 Pavlick going 70 to 72 miles per hour (MPH) down Pali Highway,

 where the speed limit was 35 MPH, and the same speed on

 Kalanianaole Highway, where the speed limit went from 45 MPH to

 35 MPH to 25 MPH. At one point, Pavlick had his right turn

 signal on, even though there was no place to turn right and no

 lane to his right, and he was going 70 MPH.

 
When Officer Dowkin stopped Pavlick, Pavlick's eyes

 
were red, watery, bloodshot, and glassy, and there was a very

 strong odor of an alcohol-type of beverage on his breath. 
Pavlick testified that he had had two to three drinks before

 leaving Honolulu. Pavlick told Officers Dowkin and Aaron

 Ostachuk (Officer Ostachuk) he was going to Honolulu when he was

 stopped, even though he had been heading in the direction of

 Kailua. Pavlick first said he lived in Honolulu, then said he

 lived in Kailua.

 
Officer Ostachuk testified that Pavlick exhibited every

 
clue of impairment on the walk-and-turn test, and failed the one­

 Pavilck's opening brief violates Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) in many respects, including a failure to include a
table of authorities and a Statement of Related Cases. HRAP Rule 28(b)(1),and (11). Most importantly, Pavlick's "Points of Error" section is gravelydeficient in that it provides no record citations for the preservation of hisclaimed error or the District Court's challenged ruling. However, becausethis court prefers to address the merits of a case where possible, we willrule on Pavlick's challenge to the extent it is discernable. See Bettencourt 
v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d. 553, 558 (1995). Counsel is 
warned that future failures to comply with court rules may result insanctions.

legged stand test. Based on Pavlick's performance on the
 
 
standardized field sobriety tests, Officer Ostachuk believed

 Pavlick was under the influence of an intoxicant.

 
There was sufficient evidence that Pavlick operated or 
assumed actual physical control of a vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against casualty, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). See HRS § 291E-61(a)(1); State v. Gaston, 108 Hawai
'i 308, 311, 
119 P.3d 616, 619 (App. 2005). See also, e.g., State v. Ferm, 94 
Hawai'i 17, 27, 7 P.3d 193, 203 (App. 2000); and State v. 
Mitchell, 94 Hawai 'i 388, 399-400, 15 P.3d 314, 325-26 (App. 
2000). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on September 11, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit, K
ane'ohe Division, is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 30, 2015.
