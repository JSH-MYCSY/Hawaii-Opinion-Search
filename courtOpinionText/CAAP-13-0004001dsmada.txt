ROBERT D. FERRIS TRUST, Appellant-Appellant
v.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0349)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in this case, it appears that 
we lack appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Appellant-
Appellant Robert D. Ferris Trust (Appellant Ferris) has asserted from the Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano's September 16, 2013 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law; Decision and Order" (hereinafter the September 16, 2013 order), because the circuit court has not reduced the September 16, 2013 order to a separate judgment, as Rules 58 and 72(k) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) require in an administrative appeal from a circuit court pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013). 
"Review of any final judgment of the circuit court
 
under this chapter shall be governed by chapter 602." HRS 
§ 91-15 (1993). The intermediate court of appeals has
 jurisdiction "[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
agency when appeals are allowed by law[.]" HRS § 602-57(1) 
(Supp. 2013). Under HRS § 641-1(a), "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts[.]" Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (emphasis added). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
Although the instant case involves an administrative
 
1
appeal, HRCP Rule 72(k)  similarly requires that, upon a circuit
court's adjudication of an administrative appeal, "the court
 having jurisdiction shall enter judgment." 
HRCP Rule 72(k). The
 
separate judgment document rule under the holding in 
Jenkins
 
applies to a secondary appeal from a circuit court order that
 adjudicates an administrative appeal. See, e.g., Raquinio v.
 
1 Rule 81(e) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)
requires that the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure "shall apply
to any proceedings in a circuit court pursuant to appeal to the
circuit court from a governmental official or body (other than acourt), except as otherwise provided in Rule 72."

Nakanelua, 77 Hawai 'i 499, 500, 889 P.2d 76, 77 (App. 1995) ("We 
conclude . . . that the requirements for appealability set forth 
in Jenkins apply to appeals from circuit court orders deciding appeals from orders entered by the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations."). Therefore, where a circuit court failed to reduce dispositive orders in an administrative appeal to a separate judgment, we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction: 
In Raquinio's case, the requirements of HRCP Rules 58
and 72(k) and Jenkins apply and have not been satisfied.
Therefore, Raquinio's appeal is premature, and we do not
have appellate jurisdiction.
 
Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
 
Id.
 
Likewise in the instant administrative appeal, the
 
requirements of HRCP Rule 58, HRCP Rule 72(k) and Jenkins apply,
 
and the circuit court has not reduced the September 16, 2013
 order to a separate judgment that, on its face, enters judgment
 in favor of and against the appropriate parties. On December 13,
 2013, the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP­13-0004001 was filed, and the record on appeal does not contain a
 separate judgment. Absent an appealable final judgment,
 Appellant Ferris's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0004001 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
