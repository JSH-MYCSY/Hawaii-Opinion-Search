Appellants ask the court to "1) reverse the denial of
 
[Appellants'] Motion to Intervene; 2) vacate the order granting
 [CPB's] Motion for Possession; and 3) vacate the Judgment for
 Possession and Writ of Possession in favor of [CPB]." However,
 upon careful review of the record and the briefs and other
 submissions filed by the parties, and having given due
 consideration to the arguments advanced and all of the issues
 raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case
 law, we conclude that we must dismiss this appeal as moot.
 
"'[M]ootness is an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction. Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable 
de novo.'" State v. 
Nakanelua, 134 Hawai �i 489, 501, 345 P.3d 155, 167 (2015) 
(quoting Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai �i 1, 4–5, 
193 P.3d 839, 842–43 (2008)). CPB has twice raised the issue of mootness on motions to this court, but the court has deferred a final ruling on this issue to permit a thorough review of all of

3the parties' arguments and the record on appeal.  In any case,
however, an appellate court has "an independent obligation to
ensure jurisdiction over each case and to dismiss the appeal sua
sponte if a jurisdictional defect exists."  State v. Graybeard,
93 Hawai #i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000) (citation
omitted).   Furthermore, an appellate court does not have
"jurisdiction to 'decid[e] abstract propositions of law or moot
cases.'"  Lathrop v. Sakatani , 111 Hawai #i 307, 312, 141 P.3d
480, 485 (2006) (citing Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Haw., 62
Haw. 391, 394-95, 616 P.2d 201, 204 (1980)).  The duty of the
appellate court "is to decide actual controversies by a judgment
which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions about
moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles
or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the
case before it."  Id. (citing Wong , 62 Haw. at 394–95, 616 P.2d
at 204).  
It is well established that: 
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the circumstances
that destroy the justiciability of a suit previously
suitable for determination. Put another way, the suit must
remain alive throughout the course of litigation to the
moment of final appellate disposition. Its chief purpose is
to assure that the adversary system, once set in operation,
remains properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate
where events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties that the
two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal--
adverse interest and effective remedy--have been
compromised.  
Id. at 312-13, 141 P.3d at 485-86 (citing Wong, 62 Haw. at 394,
616 P.2d at 203-04).  
In addition, "it is appellant's burden to seek a stay
if post-appeal transactions could render the appeal moot."  Id.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
at 313, 141 P.3d at 486 (citing In re Gotcha Int'l L.P., 311 B.R. 
250, 255 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2004)). An appellant may obtain a stay pending appeal pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 62. HRCP 62 states in relevant part: 
(c) Injunction pending appeal. When an appeal is taken
from an interlocutory or final judgment granting,
dissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its
discretion may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an
injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such terms
as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the
security of the rights of the adverse party.
 
(d) Stay upon appeal. When an appeal is taken the
appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay. .
. . The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the
notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the
appeal, as the case may be. The stay is effective when the
supersedeas bond is approved by the court.
 
. . . . 
(g) Power of supreme court and intermediate court of
appeals not limited. The provisions in this rule do not
limit any power of the supreme court or of the intermediate
court of appeals or of a justice or judge thereof to stay
proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend,
modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency
of an appeal or make any order appropriate to preserve the
status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently
to be entered.
 
In the instant case, Appellants did not seek to file a
 
supersedeas bond or otherwise obtain a court order staying the
 
judgment. Appellants argue, without any support in the record on
 appeal, that they could not afford to post a supersedeas bond,
 and that remaining on the subject property would have subjected
 them to criminal liability. Based on our review of the record,
 however, there is no indication that Appellants attempted to
 obtain a stay. It also appears to be undisputed that, after
 Appellants vacated the subject property pursuant to the Circuit
 Court's issuance of the Writ of Possession, the property was sold
 to a third-party purchaser, with a warranty deed being recorded

in the State of Hawai 'i Bureau of Conveyances on May 22, 2015. 
Accordingly, this appeal is moot. 
Appellants have argued that, even if mootness would 
otherwise apply, an exception to the mootness doctrine precludes 
its application. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has recognized three 
exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" (CRER) exception; (2) the public 
interest exception; and (3) the collateral consequences 
exception. Lethem, 119 Hawai
'i at 5-10, 193 P.3d at 843-48. 
With respect to the CRER exception, the supreme court
 
has recognized that "a court will not dismiss a case on the
 grounds of mootness where a challenged governmental action would
 evade full review because the passage of time would prevent any
 single plaintiff from remaining subject to the restriction
 complained of for the period necessary to complete the lawsuit." 
Id. at 5, 193 P.3d at 843 (quoting In re Thomas, 73 Haw. 223,
 226–27, 832 P.2d 253, 255 (1992)). In the instant case, the CRER
 exception does not appear to apply "because the instant case
 would not evade review but for the fact that the [Appellants
 failed] to file a supersedeas bond." City Bank v. Abad Artemio
 
M. Abad Revocable Trust Gloria P. Abad Revocable Trust, No. 27953, 2009 WL 5084083 at *5 (Haw. App. Dec. 28, 2009). In other words, Appellants failed to "avail themselves of the mechanisms that would have preserved the issue for review[.]" Lathrop, 111 
Hawai
'i at 315, 141 P.3d at 488. 
With regard to the public interest exception, the court
 
considers: "(1) the public or private nature of the question
 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
presented; (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination 
for future guidance of public officers; and (3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question." Doe v. Doe, 116 Hawai
'i 323, 
327, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As to the first prong, the sale of the subject property "is more of a dispute of a private nature rather than a public nature[.]" City Bank, 2009 WL 5084083 at *5. As to the 
second prong, the public interest does not require any additional authoritative determination to guide officials. As to the third prong, "questions within the instant case will recur only when parties [fail] to file a supersedeas bond to stay the circuit court's ruling pending appeal." Id. Moreover, the recurrence of 
the questions presented in this appeal are unlikely. Therefore, the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine does not appear to apply. 
With regard to the collateral consequences exception, 
the supreme court has "adopted the collateral consequences exception to the mootness doctrine in cases involving domestic violence TROs [(temporary restraining orders)] where there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will occur as a result of the entry of the TRO." Lethem, 119 
Hawai
'i at 9–10, 193 P.3d at 847–48 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). In the instant case, the collateral consequences exception does not apply because this case does not involve a domestic violence TRO or any other circumstance that has been held to warrant application of this exception.

Based on the foregoing, we dismiss this appeal as moot.
 
CPB's second motion to dismiss, filed on October 7, 2015, is
 
denied as unnecessary.
