OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
VANESSA COTTON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DCW-13-0002459)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Vanessa Cotton appeals from the
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order filed on October 10,
 
2013 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division ("District Court").
1 Cotton was convicted of Assault in
 
the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 707­712(1)(a) (1993).
 
On appeal, Cotton contends that the State failed to
 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts negating Cotton's "defense
 of others" justification. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Cotton's
 point of error as follows and affirm:
 
On appeal, we consider the evidence adduced below in 
the strongest light for the prosecution. State v. Matavale, 115 
Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007). In so doing, 
we find that the State did, in fact, adduce substantial evidence to negate Cotton's justification defense. 
"The prosecution disproves a justification defense

beyond a reasonable doubt when the trial court believes the
 
prosecution's case and disbelieves the defendant's case." State
 
v. Jhun, 83 Hawai 'i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996) (citing 
State v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. 448, 456-57, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (1994)). Here, the District Court credited, and thus believed, a State witness's version of events. The witness—a security guard at the shopping center where the incident occurred—testified that Cotton kicked the complaining witness only after the security guard attempted to intervene in a fight between Cotton's sister and the complaining witness. We will not disturb the District Court's decision to credit this testimony, for "[i]t is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. 
Sprattling, 99 Hawai
'i 312, 317, 55 P.3d 276, 281 (2002) (quoting 
State v. Sua, 92 Hawai 'i 61, 69, 987 P.2d 959, 967 (1999)) 
(internal quotation marks and original brackets omitted). "'Substantial evidence' . . . is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Matavale, 115 
Hawai
'i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 
236, 248–49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). Thus, there was substantial evidence that Cotton's kick was not for the purpose of defending her sister during the altercation. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order filed on October 10, 2013 in the District
 Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
