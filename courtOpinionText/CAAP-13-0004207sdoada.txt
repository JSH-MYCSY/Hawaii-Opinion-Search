 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This case arises out of Alama's May 16, 2011 Verified 
Complaint for Ejectment, seeking to eject her sister, Kahanaoi, 
from 2260 Moreira Street, Honolulu, Hawai 'i 96813 (Subject 
Property). 
On appeal, Kahanaoi argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
when it granted the August 1, 2013 Second Amended MSJ Order
 because (1) Alama lacked standing to eject Kahanaoi from the
 Subject Property; and (2) it did "not view[] the entire record
 even if many things were absent." Kahanaoi also argues that the
 Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) "failed to adhere to
 high fiduciary duties" but does not attribute any error to the
 Circuit Court or Alama. Kahanaoi does not present any arguments
 regarding the TRO/Stay Order, the Reconsideration Order or the
 Second Stay Order.
 
After a careful review of the points raised, the
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 authority, we resolve Kahanaoi's appeal as follows:
 
1. This court lacks jurisdiction over the August 1, 
2013 Second Amended MSJ Order. HRS § 641-1 (1993 & Supp. 2015) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals only from "final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). The Record on Appeal does not contain a 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
separate appealable written judgment on the Second Amended MSJ
 
Order. 
An exception to the general rule requiring a final 
judgment is the Forgay doctrine, Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), "allow[ing] an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). Under the Forgay doctrine, the appellate court "ha[s] jurisdiction to consider appeals from judgments which [1] require immediate execution of a command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and [2] the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the litigation." Id. (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted; some brackets omitted, some brackets added). 
In the instant case, the MSJ orders appear to (1)
 
require immediate execution of a command that Kahanaoi must
 deliver real property to Kahanaoi's adversary, Alama, and (2) the
 losing party, Kahanaoi, would be subjected to irreparable injury
 if appellate review had to await the final outcome of the
 litigation. However, the supreme court explained the following
 general rule regarding any amended judgment:
 
The general rule is that where a judgment is amended
in a material and substantial respect, the time within
which an appeal from such determination may be taken
begins to run from the date of the amendment, although
where the amendment relates only to the correction of
a clerical error, it does not affect the time allowed
for appeal.
 
Moreover,
 
If the amendment of a final judgment or decree for the
purpose of correcting a "clerical error" either
materially alters rights or obligations determined by
the prior judgment or decree or creates a right of
appeal where one did not exist before, the time for
appeal should be measured from the entry of the
amended judgment. If, however, the amendment has
neither of these results, but instead makes changes in
the prior judgment which have no adverse effect upon
those rights or obligations or the parties' right to
appeal, the entry of the amended judgment will not
postpone the time within which an appeal must be taken
from the original decree.
 
Poe v. Hawai 'i Labor Relations Bd.,  98 Hawai 'i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted; 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
emphasis added); State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i 235, 246 n.6, 
178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 (2008). 
In the instant case, the October 31, 2012 MSJ Order 
referred to the wrong parcel of real property and the March 19, 
2013 First Amended MSJ Order amended it in material and substantial respects by correcting the incorrect reference to the Subject Property and adding the requirement that the occupiers of the property were responsible for removing their personal property from the Subject Property. The March 19, 2013 First Amended MSJ Order authorized Alama for the first time to physically remove Kahanaoi from the Subject Property. Therefore, the March 19, 2013 First Amended MSJ Order triggered a thirty-day time period under Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal. 
The August 1, 2013 Second Amended MSJ Order did not 
trigger a new thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal because it merely amended the March 19, 2013 First Amended MSJ Order by correcting a clerical error and did not materially alter rights or obligations determined by the March 19, 2013 First Amended MSJ Order or create a right of appeal that did not exist before. Therefore, under Poe, the subsequent entry of the August 1, 2013 Second Amended MSJ Order did not postpone the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) during which Kahanaoi was required to file a notice of appeal. 
The thirty-day period for Kanahaoi to file an appeal 
from the First Amended MSJ Order ended on April 18, 2013. Kahanaoi did not file her October 18, 2013 notice of appeal within that period. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give
 
timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, this court does not have
 jurisdiction to review the Second Amended MSJ Order. 
2. The three appealable post-judgment orders.
 
As the First Amended MSJ Order was an immediately 
appealable final order under the Forgay doctrine and under the holding in Poe, the March 19, 2013 First Amended MSJ Order qualifies as a "judgment" because the word "'[j]udgment[,]' as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies." HRCP Rule 54(a). Therefore, all subsequent orders that relate to the First Amended MSJ Order are post-judgment orders and "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). Although a separate 
judgment is usually necessary for an appeal from dispositive rulings under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto, 103 Hawai
'i at 
158, 80 P.3d at 979. 
Each of the three post-judgment orders, the TRO/Stay
 
Order, the Reconsideration Order, and the Second Stay Order
 finally determined and ended the post-judgment proceedings for
 each of Kahanaoi's respective motions. Therefore, under the
 Forgay doctrine and the principles governing appealability of
 post-judgment orders under HRS § 641-1(a), all three are
 independently appealable final post-judgment orders.
 
However, Kahanaoi makes no argument in her brief that
 
constitutes a challenge to any of the three appealable post-
judgment orders. "Points not argued may be deemed waived." HRAP
 Rule 28(b)(7). Therefore, we decline to review the post-judgment
 orders.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we express no opinion
 
regarding the merits of the August 1, 2013 Second Amended Order
 Granting Plaintiff Williamae Hinano Alama's Motion for Summary
 Judgment over which we have no jurisdiction. The Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit's September 18, 2013 Order Denying Defendant
