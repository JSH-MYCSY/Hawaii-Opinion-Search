Roxanne A 'opohakuku Craig-Rodenhurst, Kanai Rodenhurst,

 of
the State of Hawai 'i (land court) in favor of Respondents-

(1) June 25, 2013 "Order Granting [HSBC's] Motion to
 
Dismiss Petition For Revocation of Land Court Certificate of
 
Title No. CTI 988,098 and 'Mortgagee Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to
 Power of Sale' Recorded Under Document Nos. 3977456 and 2010­096223, Filed April 3, 2013," which dismissed Appellants'
 September 10, 2012 "Petition For Revocation of Land Court
 Certificate of Title No. CTI 988,098 and 'Mortgagee Quitclaim
 Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale' Recorded Under Document Nos.
 3977456 and 2010-096223" (Petition); and
 
(2) the August 8, 2013 "Order Granting [RCO's] Joinder
 
in [HSBC's] Motion to Dismiss Petition For Revocation of Land
 Court Certificate of Title No. CTI 988,098 and 'Mortgagee
 Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to Power of Sale' Recorded Under Document
 Nos. 3977456 and 2010-096223."
 
On appeal, Appellants contend the land court erred in
 (1) granting HSBC's April 3, 2013 motion to dismiss and 
RCO's April 17, 2013 joinder to HSBC's motion to dismiss on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel because the March 20, 2013 final judgment rendered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai
'i (federal district court) had not yet been 
issued when the Appellants filed their Petition; and 
(2) concluding, based on an incorrect interpretation of 
the land court's enabling statute, that the federal district court had authority in a prior lawsuit filed March 23, 2010 (first lawsuit) by Luckie Lee Kaleikini Rodenhurst and Roxanne 
A
'opohakuku Craig-Rodenhurst (Mortgagors-Appellants) to determine 
whether HSBC's certificate of title and quitclaim deed were void 
due to wrongful foreclosure proceedings. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 Appellants' appeal is without merit because the federal district
 court had authority to determine whether or not the foreclosure
 proceedings at issue were wrongful and the Appellants' Petition
 was barred by res judicata.

I.	 The land court did not err in interpreting its enabling
statute to provide the federal district court with
concurrent jurisdiction over suits challenging the validity
of foreclosure proceedings.
 
The land court's enabling statute, Hawaii Revised
 
2
Statutes (HRS) § 501-1 (2006 Repl.),  gives the land court "(1)
exclusive original jurisdiction over applications for 
registration of land, and (2) concurrent jurisdiction over issues brought pursuant to chapter 501 that arise after the initial registration of land in land court." Childs v. Harada, 130 
Hawai
'i 387, 404, 311 P.3d 710, 727 (App. 2013), cert. denied, 
No. SCWC-29968, 2014 WL 1976600 (Haw. May 15, 2014). This exclusive original jurisdiction includes amendments or alterations to a certificate of title. Id. at 405, 311 P.3d at 
728. The concurrent jurisdiction includes title disputes
 
concerning registered land. Id.
 
In the first lawsuit, Mortgagors-Appellants alleged the
 
federal district court had jurisdiction over their state law
 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) (2012) "because the
 factual matters underlying the federal and state claims are
 closely related, making disposition of all claims proper and
 necessary." Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), a federal district court
 has supplemental jurisdiction over a party's state law claims
 when such claims "are so related to" the party's federal law
 claims "that they form part of the same case or
 controversy . . . ." We agree with the Mortgagors-Appellants
 that the federal district court had supplemental jurisdiction
 over their state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), and
 therefore conclude that the federal district court had authority
 
2
 HRS § 501-1 provides in relevant part that the land court:
 
§501-1 Court; jurisdiction; proceedings; location;
rules, practices, etc. . . . shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction of all applications for the registration of
title to land and easements or rights in land held and
possessed in fee simple within the State, with power to hear
and determine all questions arising upon such applications,
and also have jurisdiction over such other questions as may
come before it under this chapter[.]

to determine the validity of the foreclosure proceedings at issue
 
pursuant to its concurrent jurisdiction with the land court.
II.	 The land court did not err because Appellants' Petition was
barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
 
The Appellants argue that neither res judicata nor
 
collateral estoppel barred their Petition. The land court,
 
however, concluded that the Appellants' Petition was barred by
 the doctrine of res judicata, and made no mention of collateral
 estoppel. Our review is therefore limited to the issue of
 whether or not the land court erred in applying res judicata.
3
 
The purpose of the doctrine of res judicata is to
prevent a multiplicity of suits and to provide a limit to
litigation. It serves to relieve parties of the cost and
vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources,
and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage
reliance on adjudication. The res judicata doctrine thus
furthers the interests of litigants, the judicial system and
society by bringing an end to litigation where matters have
already been tried and decided on the merits. It is a rule
 of fundamental and substantial justice, of public policy and
private peace.
 
The doctrine therefore permits every litigant to have
an opportunity to try his case on the merits; but it also
requires that he be limited to one such opportunity.
Unsatisfied litigants have a remedy: they can appeal through
available channels. But they cannot, even if the first suit
may appear to have been decided wrongly, file new suits. 
Kauhane v. Acutron Co., 71 Haw. 458, 463-64, 795 P.2d 276, 278-79
 
(1990) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets
 omitted).
 
Res judicata bars relitigation when the same parties
 
from a prior lawsuit, or their privies, attempt to bring claims
 that arose from "the same subject matter" as the prior lawsuit. 
Tortorello v. Tortorello,  113 Hawai 'i 432, 439, 153 P.3d 1117, 
1124 (2007) (emphasis omitted). The party asserting res judicata
 must establish that: 
3
 Res judicata, or claim preclusion, and
collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, are
doctrines that limit a litigant to one opportunity to
litigate aspects of the case to prevent inconsistent
results and multiplicity of suits and to promote
finality and judicial economy. [These doctrines] are,
however, separate [and] involve distinct questions of
law.

, 104 Hawai' i 43, 53, 85 P.3d 150, 160 (2004) (citation,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) there was a final judgment on the merits, (2) both
parties are the same or in privity with the parties in the
original suit, and (3) the claim presented in the action in
question is identical to the one decided in the original
suit, or to a claim or defense that might have been properly
litigated in the first action but was not litigated or
decided.
 
E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai 'i 154, 160, 296 P.3d 
1062, 1068 (2013). 
Here, the land court did not err in concluding that
 
Appellants' Petition was barred by the doctrine of res judicata
 
because HSBC satisfied the three-part test set forth by Esteban. 
First, the federal district court entered a final judgment on the
 merits on March 20, 2013, prior to the land court's June 25, 2013
 order granting HSBC's motion to dismiss Appellants' Petition, and
 the Mortgagors-Appellants did not appeal the first lawsuit.
 Second, HSBC and the Mortgagors-Appellants were parties to the
 first lawsuit and Kanai Rodenhurst, Onepookela S. Rodenhurst,
 Henry R. James III, and Keala Rodenhurst were in privity with the
 Mortgagors-Appellants because their alleged interests in the
 Property as tenants and beneficiaries of the Mortgagors-
Appellants derived from the Mortgagors-Appellants' interests in
 the Property. See State by Price v. Magoon, 75 Haw. 164, 191,
 
858 P.2d 712, 725 (1993) (holding that res judicata barred a
 party from litigating the issue of ownership of a parcel of real
 property because the party was in privity with his predecessors
 in interest who were parties to a prior lawsuit that issued a
 final judgment on the merits as to ownership). And third, in
 both lawsuits, Appellants raised the same claim that the
 foreclosure proceedings were wrongful and therefore HSBC's
 certificate of title and quitclaim deed should be declared void.
 Both lawsuits arose from the same subject matter or underlying
 facts and raised the same claim. Kauhane, 71 Haw. at 464, 795
 
P.2d at 279 ("To determine whether a litigant is asserting the
 same claim in a second action, the court must look to whether the
 'claim' asserted in the second action arises out of the same
 transaction, or series of connected transactions, as the 'claim'
 asserted in the first action.").
