NO. CAAP-13-0004250
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
WILLIS LOUIE, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI 'I AT MANOA and
 
JENNIFER CHANDLER, Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2650-12-KKS)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
does not have jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Willis
 
Louie's (Appellant Louie) appeal from the following two
 interlocutory orders by the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto,
 
(1) the August 20, 2013 "Order Granting
Defendant's Motion to set Aside Entry of
Default Filed March 3, 2009," and
 
(2) the September 16, 2013 "Order
Denying Motion to Reconsider Entry of
Default,"
 
because the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final
 
judgment on all claims pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP).
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2013) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS 
§ 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its
face all of the issues in the case, the burden of
searching the often voluminous circuit court record to
verify assertions of jurisdiction is cast upon this
court. Neither the parties nor counsel have a right
to cast upon this court the burden of searching a
voluminous record for evidence of finality[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in 
favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). The record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-13-0004250 was filed on November 26, 2013, and the circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment in this case. Absent a separate judgment, the two interlocutory orders are not eligible for appellate review. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement
 
exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine
 (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS
 § 641-1(b), the two interlocutory orders do not satisfy the
 requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the

collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay 
doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai 'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Therefore, the two interlocutory orders are not appealable orders. Absent an appealable separate judgment, Appellant Louie's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-13-0004250. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0004250 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
