APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-2650-12-KKS)
 
ORDER DENYING MARCH 20, 2014 HRAP RULE 40
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF MARCH 10, 2014 ORDER
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) March 10, 2014 order dismissing 
appellate court case number CAAP-13-0004250 for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiff-Appellant Willis Louie's (Appellant Louie) March 20, 2014 motion for reconsideration of the March 10, 2014 dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears that we did not overlook or misapprehend any points of law or fact when we entered the March 10, 2014 dismissal order. Therefore, Appellant Louie's March 20, 2014 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the March 10, 2014 dismissal order lacks merit.

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant
 
Louie's March 20, 2014 HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of
 
the March 10, 2014 dismissal order is denied.
