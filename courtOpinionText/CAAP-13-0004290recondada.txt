APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-1577)

 
ORDER DENYING APRIL 5, 2016 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION OF MARCH 30, 2016 ORDER

DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) the March 30, 2016 order dismissing
 
appellate court case number CAAP-13-0004290 for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction, (2) Plaintiffs-Appellants Ke Kailani Development,
 LLC, and Michael J. Fuchs's (the Appellants) April 5, 2016 motion
 to reconsider that March 30, 2016 dismissal order pursuant to
 Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and 
(3) the record, it appears that the court did not overlook or
 misapprehend any points of fact or law when we entered the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 30, 2016 dismissal order.
 
Appellants argue that the issue whether the circuit 
court abused its discretion by granting the HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) 
extension of time was not properly before the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals because no party contested the issue of timeliness in any appellate brief. However, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has consistently held that 
[i]n each appeal, the supreme court is required to determine
whether it has jurisdiction. . . . Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further. . .
 . An appellant's failure to file a timely notice of appeal
is a jurisdictional defect that can neither be waived by the
parties nor disregarded by the court in exercise of judicial
discretion.
 
Poe v. Hawai 'i Labor Relations Board, 98 Hawai 'i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; 
emphasis added); Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) ("When we perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal.") (citation omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, the fact that no party contested the issue of timeliness in any appellate brief is irrelevant. This court clearly had a duty to review the jurisdictional issue whether the Appellants' appeal was timely. 
Appellants next argue that it was inappropriate for
 
this court to hold that the circuit court abused its discretion
 by granting the Appellants' HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion for an
 
-2Â­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-extension of time because the transcript of the hearing for the
Appellants' HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) motion was not in the record on
appeal.  However, ensuring that the record on appeal contains all
relevant documents is the duty of the appellant.
It is the responsibility of each appellant to provide a
record, as defined in Rule 10 and the Hawai# i Court Records
Rules, that is sufficient to review the points asserted and
to pursue appropriate proceedings in the court or agency
from which the appeal is taken to correct any omission.
HRAP Rule 11(a).
Although the Appellants attached a copy of the hearing
transcript to their April 5, 2016 HRAP Rule 40 motion for
reconsideration of the March 30, 2016 dismissal order, the
hearing transcript would not have changed our conclusion that the
circuit court abused its discretion by finding excusable neglect
for the Appellants' untimely appeal.  The Supreme Court of
Hawai#i has long held that the failure of a circuit court to
provide formal notice of entry of an appealable order or
appealable judgment does not excuse any aggrieved party from
filing a timely notice of appeal.  For example, thirty years ago,
the Supreme Court of Hawai #i held that, where the appellant had
not received prompt notice that an appealable order had been
filed, it did not toll the time for appeal and her untimely
request to extend the time for appeal barred her appeal.  Bacon
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. at 652, 727 P.2d at 1130-31.
Even though she did not receive prompt notice
of entry of the order granting summary judgment,
Ms. Bacon had advance knowledge that the order
would be filed. Her attorney was present when the
oral order awarding judgment was issued, and he
approved the written order of September 23, 1985
before it was filed. Furthermore, delinquent
service of such a notice does not toll the time NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-for appeal, for HRCP Rule 77(d) expressly provides
that
[l]ack of notice of the entry by the
clerk, or failure to make such service,
does not affect the time to appeal or
relieve or authorize the court to
relieve a party for failure to appeal
within the time allowed, except as
permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Hawaii
Rules of Appellate Procedure.
We are without jurisdiction to hear and decide the
appeal, and it is dismissed.
Id. (footnote omitted; emphasis added).  Similar to the appellant
in Bacon v. Karlin, the record in this case indicates that the
Appellants' counsel was present at the relevant June 17, 2013
circuit court hearing when the circuit court announced that it
would enter the written post-judgment order that eventually
triggered the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for
filing a notice of appeal in the instant case, and, furthermore,
the lack of any formal notice of entry of that written post-
judgment order does not affect the time to appeal under HRCP Rule
77(d).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Appellants' April 5, 2016
HRAP Rule 40 motion for reconsideration of the March 30, 2016
dismissal order is denied.
