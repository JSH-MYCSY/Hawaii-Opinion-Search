IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GUY S. JOSEPH, Defendant-Appellant

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

WAI'ANAE DIVISION

(CASE NO. 1DCW-13-002579)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Guy S. Joseph appeals from a Notice 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on September 30, 2013, 
in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wai 'anae Division 
("District Court").1 The District Court convicted Joseph of one 
count of Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 707-717(1) (1993).
2
 [JROA doc. 4 at 23]  Joseph was sentenced to sixty days
in jail and required to pay a fee. [Id.] On appeal, Joseph
argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his
conviction because (1) the evidence did not establish that his
words and conduct constituted a "true threat," and (2) the State
failed to prove that he acted with the requisite state of mind.
[OB at 4–5]
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as

HRS § 707-717(1) provides, "A person commits the offense of
terroristic threatening in the second degree if the person commits terroristic
threatening other than as provided in section 707-716."

 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Joseph's appeal

as follows and affirm.

Our review is constrained by the standard of review 
that we must apply to a challenge based on the alleged insufficiency of the evidence: "[W]hether upon the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact, the evidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so that a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." In re PP, 133 Hawai
'i 235, 238–39, 325 P.3d 647, 650–51 (App. 
2014) (quoting State v. Grace, 107 Hawai 'i 133, 139, 111 P.3d 28, 
34 (App. 2005)). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find that the State adduced substantial evidence that Joseph threatened by word or conduct to cause bodily injury to the complainant, in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing her. See Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 707-715(1) 
(Supp. 2012) & -717(1), 702-206(3)(c) & (d) (1993). 
According to the complainant, on May 12, 2013, Joseph

appeared at her home unannounced and threatened her and her

boyfriend. [JROA doc. 35 at 12, 15, 22]  The last time

complainant and Joseph had seen each other, Joseph had allegedly

threatened complainant's boyfriend over a gambling issue and told

complainant to stay out of it. [JROA doc. 35 at 25-26, 50-51]

Complainant testified that Joseph told her and her boyfriend that

they "better have his money or else he going kill [them]

basically," and that Joseph also said he "had people with

semiautomatics at the end of the road waiting for us and . . . my

boyfriend . . . better have his money . . . ." [JROA doc. 35 at
16-17] Complainant claimed that she did not know what the

reference to money was about. [JROA doc. 35 at 17] According to

the complainant, Joseph removed something resembling a brown gun

handle (later identified as an axe [JROA doc. 35 at 38]) from an

area inside his car near the driver's-side window [JROA doc. 35
at 19, 29, 33] and pointed it at the complainant through the

window. [JROA doc. 35 at 29] Joseph then drove off, leaving the

complainant panicky and scared. [JROA doc. 35 at 18]

(1) We agree with the District Court that Joseph's

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
threats to the complainant constitute "true threats" falling

within the conduct prohibited by HRS § 707-717(1). That Joseph's
 
threats were conditioned on complainant's boyfriend's failure to

give Joseph the money does not negate this fact. See State v.

Edralin, No. CAAP-12-0000644, 2013 WL 2459882, at *2 (Haw. Ct.

App. June 7, 2013 [chn/ADMF/lmr] (to prove threat for terroristic

threatening in the second degree, case law does not require the

State to prove that the threat was perfectly unconditional,

merely that it was so unconditional that it conveyed a gravity of

purpose and imminent prospect of execution); State v. Oliveros,

No. 28935, 2010 WL 3433557 at *12 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2010)
[CHN/admf/kgl]. Indeed, this court has explained that "[s]imply

making a threat in conditional language does not preclude it from

being a true threat. The test is whether the threat on its face

and in the circumstances in which it is made is 'so unequivocal,

unconditional, immediate, and specific as to the person

threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent

prospect of execution.'" Oliveros, 2010 WL 3433557 at *12

(citation omitted) (quoting State v. Chung, 75 Haw. 398, 416-17,

862 P.3d 1063, 1073 (1993)). Cf. Chung, 75 Haw. at 416, 862 P.3d

at 1072 ("[T]he word 'threat' . . . exclude[s] statements which

are, when taken in context, not 'true threats' because they are

conditional and made in jest[.]" (emphasis added) (quoting U.S.

v. Kelner, 534 P.2d 1020, 1026 (2d Cir. 1976)).

Here, Joseph established his apparent ability to carry 
out the threats, such that they would reasonably tend to induce fear of bodily injury in the complainant, when he threatened her by pointing the handle of the axe at her and claimed that his friends were waiting down the road "with semiautomatics." See 
State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai
'i 465, 476-77, 24 P.3d 661, 672-73 
(2001) (explaining that arrestee's declaration to police officer that "I'm gonna kill you" without articulating the manner by which he would carry out his threat did not "imbue his remark with any qualification or limitation"); Chung, 75 Haw. at 416-17, 862 P.2d at 1073 (holding that repeated statements made to the defendant's colleagues of his intention to shoot or kill a co­worker, along with the display of a handgun and/or ammunition, 
3

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
was sufficiently unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and

specific to constitute a true threat). That is, the
 
complainant's testimony established that Joseph issued threats

with a serious demeanor, and he was specific about his immediate

intention to kill the complainant and her boyfriend if he did not

get his money. [JROA doc. 35 at 22-23] See Chung, 75 Haw. at

416-17, 862 P.2d at 1073; Oliveros, 2010 WL 3433557, at *12. As

such, Joseph's acts and statements were of the type "to convey a

gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution," Oliveros,

2010 WL 3433557, at *12, and the evidence adduced at trial was

sufficient to conclude that Joseph's threats were "true threats." 
 Therefore, Joseph's first argument is meritless.

(2) Contrary to Joseph's argument, the State presented 
sufficient proof of intent to support Joseph's conviction. Hawai
'i's courts have recognized that, "although a defendant's 
state of mind can rarely be proved by direct evidence . . . proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient. Thus, the mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." State v. Gomes, 117 Hawai
'i 218, 227, 177 P.3d 928, 937 (2008) 
(original ellipses omitted) (quoting State v. Pudiquet, 82 Hawai
'i 419, 425, 922 P.2d 1032, 1038 (App. 1996) and State v. 
Bui, 104 Hawai 'i 462, 467, 92 P.3d 471, 476 (2004)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Based on our review of the record, there was substantial evidence to support the District Court's conclusion that Joseph exhibited "reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing" the complainant when he pointed a weapon at the complainant and her boyfriend and threatened that they "better have his money or else he going kill [both of them]," and that he "had people with semiautomatics at the end of the road." See 
State v. Alston, 75 Haw. 517, 531–32, 865 P.2d 157, 165–66 (1994) (holding that the defendant exhibited a reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing the complainant "by pointing at her and threatening to return with a pistol and 'take care of that fat bitch once and for all.'"). Thus, Joseph's second argument is meritless.
