APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(HONOLULU DIVISION)

(CIVIL NO. 1RC-13-1-6471)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Stephanie Apuakehau (Apuakehau) 
appeals (pro se) from a Judgment of Possession and Writ of 
Possession, both filed on October 28, 2013, in the Ko 'olauloa 
Division of the District Court of the First Circuit (District 
Court).1 
On appeal, Apuakehau lists five points of error, which 
are noncompliant with Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
28(b)(4), but which nevertheless have been reviewed and 
considered by this court. Apuakehau contends that the District Court erred in: (1) its discussion concerning a prior case in federal court; (2) a translation request of evidence submitted;

(3) its consideration of testimony from an expert witness; (4)
 
striking Apuakehau's "evidence" of genealogical lineage; and (5)
 denying Apuakehau's motion to dismiss with prejudice. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Apuakehau's points of error as follows:
 
Apuakehau makes no argument in support of her points of
 
error; nor does she include any reference to evidence (or any
 other form of support) in the record on appeal. 
It appears that the gravamen of Apuakehau's appeal is 
that she has more than a mere possessory interest in the property that was the subject of this ejectment action and, therefore, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over this matter. However, Apuakehau failed to properly raise this issue in the District Court. Hawai
'i District Court Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 12.1 provides: 
Rule 12.1. Defense of title in district courts.
 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in defense
of an action in the nature of an action of trespass or for
the summary possession of land, or any other action, the
defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.
 
The record contains no affidavit of Apuakehau (or 
declaration subscribed as true under penalty of law) and is 
otherwise devoid of any support for Apuakehau's arguments on appeal. See Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai
'i 
32, 265 P.3d 1128 (2011). Moreover, Apuakehau's Answer to Complaint, as well as other documents submitted to the District Court by Apuakehau, assert that Mrs. Dawn Wasson, not Apuakehau, holds title to the subject property.
