IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOHN KALANI, IV, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(1DTA-12-07168)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant John Kalani IV, also known as John
 
Kalani, (Kalani) appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on May 14, 2013, in the
 District Court of the First Circuit, 
'Ewa Division (District 
Court).1 After a bench trial, the District Court convicted
 
Kalani of one count of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of
 an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (4) (Supp. 2014).

 The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.

 HRS § 291E-61(a) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty; [or]
 
. . . .

On appeal, Kalani argues that the District Court erred
 
in admitting into evidence his blood test results, which were
 
obtained in violation of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384
 U.S. 436 (1966); and even if Miranda does not apply, he was
 denied his right to counsel under HRS § 803-9 (2014).
 
The District Court, however, adjudged Kalani guilty of
 
violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (4). Subsections (a)(1)
 and (a)(4) can each serve as a basis for conviction under § 291E­61. See State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 61, 276 P.3d 617, 630 
(2012). Kalani does not contest his conviction under HRS § 291E­61(a)(1). Therefore, any error as to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) conviction was harmless. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on May 14, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit, 
'Ewa 
Division, is affirmed.
