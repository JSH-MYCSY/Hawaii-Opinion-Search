STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
Q. BRITT CORMIER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC13-1-1530)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant, Q. Britt Cormier (Cormier), pro 
se, appeals from an October 23, 2013 District Court of the First 
Circuit, 'Ewa Division (District Court) Order Denying Defendant's 
Motion to Dismiss Complaint and Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (October 23 Order) in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee, the State of Hawai
'i, Department of Labor and 
Industrial Relations (DLIR) and awarding DLIR $6,819.00 restitution for the improper collection of unemployment benefits.
1 Cormier also appeals from an October 25, 2013 
District Court Judgment awarding costs in favor of DLIR in the amount of $55.00.

On appeal, Cormier argues: (1) the District Court
 
erred by setting aside an order of dismissal with prejudice
 against DLIR; (2) the District Court violated Cormier's Due
 Process rights by denying her motion to dismiss; (3) the District

3Preliminarily, we note that Cormier's Opening brief does not
comply with Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b).
However, the Hawai# i appellate courts have "consistently adhered to the policy
of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the
merits, where possible.'"  Morgan v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai# i 173, 180-81,
86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77Hawai#i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)). Moreover, Hawai# i appellate courts
generally are more forgiving of technical flaws in pro se parties' briefs. See, e.g., Wagner v. World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai# i 190, 193, 268
P.3d 443, 446 (App. 2011).  Here, while Cormier's arguments are unclear andvery few facts are provided to support those arguments, some of Cormier'sarguments are discernible.  Additionally, DLIR did not argue that it wasprejudiced by Cormier's failure to comply with HRAP 28.  Therefore, we addressthose arguments that can be discerned.   
4Cormier did not argue, as she does now, that her due process
rights were violated by the denial of her motion.  However, as she does not
explain how her rights were violated, we decline to address this argument.
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.).
2Court erred by granting DLIR's request for restitution because
DLIR did not prove that Cormier had either the knowledge of
wrongdoing or the intent to commit a crime; (4) Cormier was the
victim of wrongful termination through discrimination by her
employer; and (5) DLIR brought the case in bad faith.  Cormier
seeks reversal and remand.
After a careful review of the issues raised3 and the
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the relevant
authority, we resolve Cormier's arguments as follows and affirm.
1. 
 The District Court did not abuse its discretion
when it dismissed the case with prejudice and later set aside the
order of dismissal against DLIR under the District Court Rules of
Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)(1).  See, Beneficial Hawai# i, Inc. v.
Casey, 98 Hawai #i 159, 45 P.3d 359 (2002) (decided under Hawai# i
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)).  Under the circumstances,
DLIR appears to have given a valid explanation for its failure to
prosecute, counsel demonstrated the mistake was not due to gross
carelessness, see Joaquin v. Joaquin , 5 Haw. App. 435, 443, 698
P.2d 298, 304 (1985) (construing Hawai# i Family Court Rule
60(b)(1)), and it was well within the discretion of the District
Court to set aside its order.
2.The District Court did not err by denying
Cormier's Motion to Dismiss.  Before the District Court,4 Cormier
argued that the statute of limitations had run on DLIR's
complaint under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 657-1.  However,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS ยง 657-1.5 exempts State agencies, such as DLIR, from any
 
applicable statute of limitations so long as the statute, itself,
 does not specifically state that the State is subject to the
 statute of limitations. Cormier does not argue that HRS Chapter
 383, under which this action was brought, makes the State subject
 to the statute of limitations.
 
3. The District Court did not err in awarding 
restitution. Cormier argues on appeal that DLIR failed to prove she was aware of her wrongdoing, but does not establish that she preserved this argument before the District Court, see State v. Fagaragan, 115 Hawai
'i 364, 367-68, 167 P.3d 739, 742-43 (2007), 
nor does she provide authority for her premise that proof of a culpable state of mind was necessary. 
4. Cormier's argument that she was the victim of
 
wrongful termination was not raised below and therefore not
 properly preserved for appeal. Fagaragan, id.
 
5. Cormier's argument that the DLIR brought this case
 
in bad faith has also not been preserved for appeal. Fagaragan,
 
id.
 
Therefore, the District Court of the First Circuit, 
'Ewa Division's October 23, 2013 Order Denying Defendant's Motion 
to Dismiss Complaint and Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and the October 25, 2013 Judgment are affirmed.
