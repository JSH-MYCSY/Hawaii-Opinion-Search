NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
NO. CAAP-13-0004785
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
TRUDY BALAI, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 06-1-0431)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 Upon review of the record, it appears that this court 
lacks jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant the 
State of Hawai 'i (State) has asserted from the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit's "Order Granting Motion for Deferred Acceptance of Guilty Plea" (Order Granting Motion for DAG Plea), 
filed on September 30, 2013, because the appeal is not authorized 
by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641–13(6) (Supp. 2012). HRS 
§ 641-13(6) authorizes appeals in criminal matters, by and on 
behalf of the State from "the sentence, on the ground that it is 
illegal." The Order Granting Motion for DAG Plea does not impose 
a sentence. See State v. Naititi, 104 Hawai
'i 224, 233, 87 P.3d 
893, 902 (2004) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets in original omitted) ("[S]tatutes granting the State the right of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
appeal in criminal cases must be strictly construed."). No other
 
subsection of HRS § 641-13 (Supp. 2012) authorizes the appeal. 
Consequently, this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0004785 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
