NO. CAAP-13-0005068
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
AS, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
CL, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(FC-M NO. 13-1-0004)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Petitioner-Appellee AS filed a Motion and Declaration
 
for Custody and Visitation with the Family Court of the First
 
1/
Circuit ("Family Court")  concerning the adopted child ("Child")
of AS's former partner, Respondent-Appellant CL. 
The motion
 
requested that the Family Court recognize AS as Child's "de facto
 
and psychological parent" pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 ("HRS") § 571-46(a)(2). Additionally, the motion sought an award
 of joint legal and joint physical custody of Child to AS or,
 alternatively, specified visitation with Child.
 
The Family Court initially concluded that relief was

 
unavailable under HRS § 571-46(a)(2) because AS did not contend
 that CL was an unfit parent. AS subsequently modified her
 petition to request relief under HRS § 571-46(a)(1). After a
 bifurcated trial, the Family Court entered its Order Re:
 August 7, 2013 Hearing on Petitioner's Motion for Custody and
 Visitation Filed April 8, 2013 on August 30, 2013 ("August 30,
 2013 Order"). In the August 30, 2013 Order, the court concluded

that "recognizing . . . 'psychological' parents as parents under
 
HRS § 571-46(a)(1) is consistent with the child-centered best
 interests standard that the statute requires the Court to apply."
 
Following a subsequent evidentiary hearing, the Family
 
Court entered its Decision and Order Re: Trial on Petitioner's
 Motion for Custody and Visitation, Filed April 8, 2013 on
 October 8, 2013 ("October 8, 2013 Decision & Order"). In the
 October 8, 2013 Decision & Order, the court concluded that AS had
 established that she was "a 'de facto' or 'psychological' parent
 to the Child," but that it was in the Child's best interest that
 sole legal custody and primary physical custody be awarded to CL,
 subject, however, to AS's right to specified visitation.
 
On appeal, CL alleges that the Family Court erred when
 
it interpreted "parent" as used in HRS § 571-46(a)(1) to include
 "psychological" and/or "de facto" parents, granted AS standing
 under HRS § 571-46(a)(1) to pursue child custody and/or
 visitation orders, and awarded AS visitation with the Child.
 
On November 3, 2016, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court issued 
its decision in A.A. v. B.B., ___ Hawai 'i ___, ___ P.3d ___, No. 
SCAP-15-0000022, 2016 WL _______ (Haw. Nov. 3, 2016), in which the court considered a similar case arising out of the Family Court of the Third Circuit based solely on the de facto custody provision of HRS § 571-46(a)(2). Upon our review of A.A. and consideration of the instant case in light of that decision, we conclude that the supreme court's HRS § 571-46(a)(2) analysis in A.A. requires affirmation of the Family Court's award of
 visitation to AS in this case, even though this case involves a
 decision under HRS § 571-46(a)(1).
 
The Family Court's finding that AS met the requirements

 
for a "de facto" parent necessarily means that AS satisfied the
 supreme court's requirements in A.A. for standing to seek custody
 under HRS § 571-46(a)(2). CL does not challenge the Family
 Court's factual findings, but argues that because AS is not a
 legal parent, she does not have standing to seek custody as a
 matter of law. A.A. clearly rejects that claim, and thus we can
 
affirm the Family Court even though the Family Court relied on a
 different ground in reaching its result in awarding visitation to

AS. Consequently, we do not reach the question of whether a "de
 
facto" parent is a "parent" within the meaning of HRS § 571­46(a)(1) or whether the four-part test adopted by the Family
 Court under HRS § 571-46(a)(1) is the proper test under that
 subsection. 
Therefore, based on the foregoing analysis we affirm
 
the October 8, 2013 Decision and Order Re: Trial on Petitioner's
 Motion for Custody and Visitation, Filed April 8, 2013.
