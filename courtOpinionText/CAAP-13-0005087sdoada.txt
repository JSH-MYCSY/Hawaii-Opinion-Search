by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  (Circuit Court), in
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee HSBC Bank USA, National Association,
 as Trustee for WFMBS (HSBC Bank). 
On appeal, Collman argues2
 the Circuit Court erred when
it denied his August 14, 2013 First Amended Motion to Vacate Void
 Judgment (Motion to Vacate Void Judgment) because (1) HSBC Bank
 lacked standing to foreclose because the mortgage was not
 assigned to HSBC Bank; and (2) HSBC Bank lacked standing to

 Collman's Point of Error in his Opening Brief does not comply with
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) in most respects.
It is well settled that failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) is alone
sufficient to affirm the circuit court's judgment. Kawamata Farms, Inc. v.
United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai' i 214, 235, 948 P.2d 1055, 1076 (1997). However,
in light of our policy to afford litigants the opportunity to have their casesheard on the merits, where possible, we will endeavor to do so here. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enforce the mortgage and note because HSBC Bank clouded the title
 
when it violated the Pooling and Service Agreement.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 authority, we resolve Collman's appeal as follows and affirm.
 
1. Collman's Motion to Vacate Void Judgment is subject 
to the requirements, and is an impermissible use, of Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b). HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) grants relief from an order or judgment when "the judgment is void[.]" Collman styled his motion as a "Motion to Vacate Void Judgment" and, in substance, argues that the May 11, 2009 Foreclosure Order is void because the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to hear HSBC Bank's case because HSBC Bank did not have standing. Collman improperly attempts to relitigate both his earlier March 6, 2012 Motion to Void Judgment and the underlying Foreclosure Order. Collman did not appeal from the underlying Foreclosure Order. Collman's appeal from the order denying his March 6, 2012 Motion to Void Judgment was dismissed by this court as untimely. We conclude that Collman's attempt to seek relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b) is an untimely second bite at the apple. See Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 
Hawai
'i 422, 433-34, 16 P.3d 827, 838-39 (App. 2000). 
2. The issues raised by Collman in this appeal are
 
barred by res judicata. Collman argues the Circuit Court erred
 when it denied his Motion to Vacate Void Judgment because HSBC
 Bank lacked standing to foreclose and to enforce the mortgage and
 note. Collman could have raised the issue of standing in
 opposition to HSBC's January 20, 2009 motion for summary judgment
 but did not. The issue of standing was finally decided when the
 Circuit Court entered the May 11, 2009 Foreclosure Order granting
 HSBC's January 20, 2009 motion for summary judgment, including
 foreclosure decree, and the time for appeal expired on June 10,
 2009, without Collman's timely notice of appeal. Therefore,
 "[u]nder the doctrine of res judicata, [Collman's] challenges to
 [HSBC Bank]'s standing were subsumed under the foreclosure
 judgment, which had became final and binding." Mortgage Elec.
