IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAYLYN GOWAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-1189)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Kalyn A.R. Gowan (Appellant Gowan) has asserted from the
 Honorable Edward H. Kubo’s October 9, 2013 “Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss
 Indictment” (the October 9, 2013 dismissal order), because the
 October 9, 2013 dismissal order does not contain a sentence, as
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (Supp. 2013) requires for
 an appeal from a judgment in a criminal circuit court case.
 
"Appellate jurisdiction in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." State v. Baxley
, 102 Hawai 'i 130, 133, 73 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d 668, 671 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks
 
omitted). The supreme court has
 
enumerated several bases for jurisdiction from a
circuit court judgment, stating that, in a
criminal case, a defendant may appeal from the
judgment of the circuit court . . . (1) pursuant
to HRS § 641-11, (2) from an interlocutory
order . . . pursuant to HRS § 641-17, (3) by
virtue of the collateral order doctrine, . . .
(4) by applying for a writ of prohibition or
mandamus under HRS § 602-5(4), . . . and (5) by
requesting exercise of this court's supervisory
powers pursuant to HRS § 602-4[.]
 
Id. at 139, 73 P.3d at 677 (citations, internal quotation marks,
 
original brackets, and footnote omitted). The relevant statute
 under the circumstances of the instant case is HRS § 641-11,
 which
 
provides in part that any party deeming oneself
aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court ina criminal matter, may appeal to the supremecourt. (Emphasis added.) Judgment is definedin HRS § 641-11 as the sentence of the court ina criminal case. Thus, by the terms of HRS§ 641-11, the appealable action of the circuitcourt is the sentence. As we concluded in [State v.] Kealaiki[, 95 Hawai' i 309, 312, 22
P.3d 588, 591 (2001)], the sentence of the courtin a criminal case is the judgment from which anappeal is authorized, and where there is noconviction and sentence . . . , there can be noappeal under HRS § 641-11. . . . Accordingly,inasmuch as Defendant appeals from the judgmentof acquittal, for which there is no sentence,there can be no jurisdiction under HRS § 641-11. 
State v. Baxley, 102 Hawai 'i at 139-40, 73 P.3d at 677-78 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and original brackets
 
omitted); see also State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 487, 510 P.2d
 88, 89 (1973) (Where a judgment of conviction does not include a
 sentence, then, under HRS § 641-11, “for purposes of appeal, we
 are of the opinion that the judgment entered in this case is not
 a final judgment conferring appellate jurisdiction on this
 court.” (Footnote omitted)); State v. Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 11,
 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980) (“In the instant case, appellant
 brought this appeal from the First Circuit Court’s order denying
 his motion to dismiss the indictment. We hold that such an order
 is interlocutory and is not a final order or judgment. It is
 therefore not one that is appealable under HRS § 641-11.”); State

v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai 'i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (“There 
having been no conviction and sentence in this case, there can be 
no appeal under HRS § 641-11 from the . . . order granting Defendant's plea deferral”). 
In the instant case, the October 9, 2013 dismissal
 
order finally ended this circuit court criminal case by
 dismissing with prejudice all of Plaintiff-Appellee State of
 Hawaii’s pending criminal charges against Appellant Gowan. 
Understandably, the October 9, 2013 dismissal order contains no
 sentence, but, the lack of any sentence in the October 9, 2013
 dismissal order means that it does not qualify as an appealable
 judgment under HRS § 641-11. Consequently, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over Appellant Gowan’s appeal in appellate court
 case number CAAP-13-0005132. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0005132 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
or requests in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005132 are
 dismissed as moot.
