NO. CAAP-13-0005192 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CORINNE GRACE LANKFORD, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KIRK MATTHEW LANKFORD, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 08-1-2336)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kirk Matthew Lankford (Lankford)
 
appeals from a October 18, 2013 Family Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (family court) post-judgment order denying his Hawai 'i 
Family Court (HFCR) Rule 60(b) motion for post-decree relief from 
an April 17, 2009 divorce decree that dissolved his marriage to 
Plaintiff-Appellee Corinne G. Lankford (Corinne). 
On July 31, 2008 Lankford was convicted in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit of the State of Hawai 'i of murder in 
the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. State v. Lankford, No. 29287, (Haw. May 
13, 2011) (mem.) Lankford did not appeal the April 17, 2009 divorce decree which awarded sole custody of Lankford's children to Corinne with visitation at Corinne's discretion. 
On March 19, 2012, Lankford filed an application for
 
modification of the divorce decree seeking visitation and contact
 with the children. Lankford was at the time imprisoned at
 Saguaro Correctional Center in Arizona. On July 13, 2012, the

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
family court denied Lankford's motion stating there was no
 
material change in circumstances since the divorce decree was
 entered, that Corinne had not abused her discretion, and there
 was insufficient proof that contact would be in the best interest
 of the children. Lankford did not appeal the order denying his
 application for modification.
 
On December 26, 2012, while still imprisoned in
 
Arizona, Lankford filed a "H.F.C.R. 60(b) Petition Requesting
 Relief From April 17, 2009 Divorce Decree," once again asking for
 contact and visitation with the children. On October 18, 2013,
 this second motion for modification was denied and on November 7,
 2013, Lankford filed this appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Lankford's appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 18, 2013 "Order
 
Denying Motion for Rule 60(b) Relief" entered in the Family Court
 of the First Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, March 24, 2015.
