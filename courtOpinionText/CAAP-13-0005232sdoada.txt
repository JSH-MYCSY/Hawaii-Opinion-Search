v.
 
BYRON D. CHEEK-ENRIQUES, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-11-05193)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Byron D. Cheek-Enriques (Cheek-
Enriques) appeals from the Judgment entered on October 16, 2013,
 
in the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1
  
Cheek-Enriques was convicted of operating a vehicle under the
 influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2014).
2 We affirm.
 
1The Honorable David W. Lo presided.
 
2HRS § 291E–61(a)(3) provides:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
 
person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:

A police officer observed Cheek-Enriques's vehicle
 
twice drifting outside its lane before jerking back and then
 
drifting outside its lane and almost colliding with a concrete
 barrier. The officer stopped Cheek-Enriques's vehicle and
 subsequently arrested Cheek-Enriques for OVUII. After placing
 Cheek-Enriques under arrest, the officer read to Cheek-Enriques 
a form entitled "Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle
 Implied Consent for Testing" (Implied Consent Form). Cheek-
Enriques agreed to take a breath test, which showed that he had a
 breath alcohol concentration of 0.155 grams of alcohol per 210
 liters of breath -- a concentration that exceeded the legal
 limit. Cheek-Enriques moved to suppress the results of his
 breath test, and his motion was denied by the District Court.
 
On appeal, Cheek-Enriques challenges the District 
Court's denial of his motion to suppress. Cheek-Enriques argues that: (1) because the police failed to give him Miranda warnings before reading the Implied Consent Form to him and obtaining his decision on testing, the results of his breath test should have been suppressed as the fruit of a Miranda violation; (2) the results of his breath test should have been suppressed because the police misinformed him of his statutory right to an attorney under HRS § 803-9 (1993); and (3) the results of his breath test should have been suppressed because they were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai
'i 
Constitution. 
We rejected the arguments raised by Cheek-Enriques in 
State v. Won, 134 Hawai 'i 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014), cert. 
granted, No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2014 WL 2881259 (Jun. 24, 2014). Based on Won, we conclude that the District Court properly denied 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]
