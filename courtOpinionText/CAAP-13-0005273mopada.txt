IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
WILLIAM A. CORNELIO, III, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0007(2); CR NO. 94-0590(2))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant William A. Cornelio, III 
(Cornelio), appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Judgment Denying [Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP)] Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" (Order Denying Petition), which was filed on November 4, 2013, by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 
On July 25, 2013, Cornelio filed a "Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief" (2013 Petition) pursuant to HRPP Rule 40
 (2006), which underlies this appeal. The sole ground for relief
 Cornelio alleged in the 2013 Petition was that his sentence was
 illegal in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-609
 (1993). HRS § 706-609 provides, in relevant part: "When a
 conviction or sentence is set aside on direct or collateral

NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attack, the court shall not impose a new sentence for the same
 
offense . . . which is more severe than the prior sentence." In
 his 2013 Petition, Cornelio claimed that his sentence was
 illegal, in violation of HRS § 706-609, because the Third Amended
 Judgment entered on June 7, 2000, and the Fourth Amended Judgment
 entered on September 13, 2011, were more severe than the Second
 Amended Judgment entered on February 3, 2000. The Circuit Court
 denied Cornelio's 2013 Petition without a hearing.
 
On appeal, Cornelio contends that the Circuit Court
 
erred in denying his 2013 Petition without a hearing because
 Cornelio claims his sentence was imposed in violation of HRS 
§ 706-609. As explained below, we conclude that Cornelio's
 appeal is without merit and that the Circuit Court properly
 denied Cornelio's 2013 Petition without a hearing.
 
BACKGROUND
 
I.
 
In his underlying criminal case, Cornelio was convicted
 
as charged in 1995 of first-degree terroristic threatening, in
 violation of HRS § 707–716(1)(d) (1993) (Count One); place to
 keep firearm, in violation of HRS § 134–6(c) (1993) (Count Two);
 prohibited possession of a firearm, in violation of HRS 
§ 134–7(b) (1993) (Count Three); prohibited possession of firearm
 ammunition, in violation of HRS § 134–7(b) (Count Four); and
 possession of a prohibited firearm or device, in violation of HRS
 § 134–8 (1993) (Count Five). Cornelio's convictions arose out of
 a brawl in which Cornelio retrieved a sawed-off shotgun from the
 trunk of his car, loaded the shotgun with ammunition, and pointed
 the shotgun at Vahafolau Faleta.
 
Cornelio was sentenced to five-year indeterminate
 
maximum terms of imprisonment as to Counts One and Five and to
 ten-year indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment as to Counts
 Two, Three, and Four. The Circuit Court ordered that all of
 Cornelio's indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment be served
 consecutively, resulting in a total indeterminate maximum term of
 imprisonment of forty years. The Circuit Court also imposed the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
following mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment: (1) three
 
years and four months as to Count One, pursuant to HRS § 706­660.1(2)(b) (1993), based on Cornelio's use of a firearm in the
 commission of a felony and his being convicted of a second
 firearm felony offense; (2) three years and four months as to
 Counts Two through Four, pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5 (1993 &
 Supp. 1996), based on Cornelio's status as a repeat offender; and
 (3) one year and eight months as to Count Five, pursuant to HRS 
§ 706-606.5, based on Cornelio's status as a repeat offender. 
The Circuit Court ordered that all the mandatory minimum terms of
 imprisonment be served consecutively, resulting in a total
 mandatory minimum term of fifteen years. The Circuit Court
 entered its Judgment on October 13, 1995, and an Amended Judgment
 on December 20, 1995. Cornelio filed a notice of appeal from the
 Judgment and an amended notice of appeal from the Amended
 Judgment.
 
In his direct appeal, Cornelio did not challenge the 
Circuit Court's imposition of consecutive indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment on Counts One through Five. State v. 
Cornelio, 84 Hawai
'i 476, 480, 935 P.2d 1021, 1025 (1997) 
("Cornelio does not challenge the consecutive character of the indeterminate maximum terms of his sentence.") Instead, Cornelio only challenged the Circuit Court's decision to run his mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment consecutively. Id. at 483 & n.20, 
935 P.2d at 1028 & n.20. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that 
"any mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment imposed pursuant to HRS § 706–606.5 in connection with a multicount indictment must be served concurrently with one another[,]" but that "a defendant subjected to mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment pursuant to HRS § 706–660.1 may . . . be sentenced to serve them consecutively to any mandatory minimum terms imposed pursuant to HRS § 706–606.5." Id. at 480, 935 P.2d at 1025. Based on this 
analysis, the supreme court held that the Circuit Court erred in ordering that the mandatory minimum terms imposed pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5 on Counts Two through Five be served consecutively, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
but that the Circuit Court did not err in ordering that the
 
mandatory minimum term imposed pursuant to HRS § 706-660.1 on
 Count One be served consecutively to the mandatory minimum terms
 imposed on Counts Two through Five. Id. at 480, 488, 494-95, 935
 
P.2d at 1025, 1033, 1039-40. Accordingly, the supreme court
 affirmed the Circuit Court's sentence with respect to Count One,
 but it vacated Cornelio's sentence with respect to Counts Two
 through Five and remanded the case "to the circuit court for
 resentencing as to those counts in a manner consistent with this
 opinion." Id. at 495, 935 P.2d at 1040.
 
II.
 
On remand, Cornelio appeared on May 13, 1997, for
 
resentencing pursuant to the supreme court's opinion. However,
 the Circuit Court's minutes of the resentencing hearing, and the
 Second Amended Judgment subsequently entered by the Circuit Court
 on February 3, 2000, reflected that both the indeterminate
 maximum terms of imprisonment and the mandatory minimum terms of
 imprisonment on Counts Two through Five were to run concurrently
 to each other, and consecutively to the sentence imposed on Count
 One.
 
On May 26, 2000, Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai
'i 
(State) filed a "Motion to Correct Minutes and Second Amended Judgment." In support of this motion, the State submitted the declaration of a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, which stated in relevant part: 
4. That on May 13, 1997, consist[e]nt with the
Supreme Court Opinion, [Cornelio's] mandatory minimum was
changed to a total of six (6) years and (8) months, instead
of a total of fifteen (15) years;
 
5. That the May 13, 1997 Minutes and the "Second
Amended Judgment", filed February 3, 2000, inaccurately
state that [Cornelio's] indeterminate sentence in Counts Two
though Five run concurrently, rather than only the mandatory
minimum. . . . ;
 
6. That the Minutes and Judgment need to be
corrected to accurately reflect that the total indeterminate
sentence is forty (40) years (all counts running
consecutively) . . . ; and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
7. That Declarant has spoken with Defense Attorney
Vickie Russell, Esq. and she agrees that the Minutes and
Second Amended Judgment are inaccurate and need to be
corrected.
 
After a hearing on the State's motion held on June 1,
 
2000, the Circuit Court granted the State's motion. On June 7,
 
2000, the Circuit Court filed its Third Amended Judgment, which
 stated that "ALL INDETERMINATE TERMS TO RUN CONSECUTIVE TO EACH
 OTHER FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY YEARS."
 
III.
 
In 1997 and 2005, Cornelio filed HRPP Rule 40 petitions 
challenging his convictions, which were denied by the Circuit Court. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court's 
denials of Cornelio's HRPP Rule 40 petitions. In 2007, Cornelio filed a motion for clarification of his sentence and a motion for the correction of illegal sentence, which challenged the Circuit Court's imposition of consecutive sentences. The Circuit Court denied the motions, and this court dismissed Cornelio's appeals from these denials because he failed to pay the filing fee or submit a motion to proceed in forma pauperis. 
In 2007, Cornelio also filed a third HRPP Rule 40 
petition, in which he argued that the convictions and sentences imposed on Counts Two through Five in the Third Amended Judgment violated the double-jeopardy and cruel-and-unusual-punishment clauses of the United States and Hawai
'i Constitutions. The 
Circuit Court denied Cornelio's third HRPP Rule 40 petition without a hearing, and Cornelio appealed to this court. We held that in light of State v. Auwae, 89 Hawai
'i 59, 968 P.2d 1070 
(App. 1998), "Cornelio raised a colorable claim that he was improperly punished for both Count 3, the prohibited-possession-of-firearm charge, and Count 4, the prohibited-possession-of-ammunition charge, and the circuit court should have held a hearing on this claim." Cornelio v. State, 
No. 28684, 2008 WL 5064906, at *5 (Hawai
'i App. Nov. 25, 2008) 
(memorandum opinion). We further held that Cornelio did not raise a colorable claim that he received improper multiple 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
punishments based on his convictions on Counts 2, 3, and 5. Id.
 
at *5-6. We vacated (1) the Circuit Court's order denying
 
Cornelio's third HRPP Rule 40 petition and (2) the part of the
 Third Amended Judgment that imposed sentences as to Count 3 and
 Count 4, and we remanded the case for further proceedings
 consistent with our opinion. Id. at *6.
 
On July 14, 2011, the State filed a motion to
 
resentence Cornelio as to Count Three and to dismiss Count Four. 
On September 13, 2011, the Circuit Court granted the State's
 motion to dismiss Count Four. On the same date, the Circuit
 Court issued the Fourth Amended Judgment, which stated: "COUNTS
 1, 2, 3, & 5 TO RUN CONSECUTIVE TO EACH OTHER FOR A TOTAL OF
 THIRTY (30) YEARS."
 
IV.
 
On July 25, 2013, Cornelio filed his 2013 Petition,
 
which raised as its sole ground that Cornelio's sentence was
 illegal because it violated HRS § 706-609. In his statement of
 supporting facts, Cornelio asserted that the Third Amended
 Judgment and Fourth Amended Judgment violated HRS § 706-609
 because they were more severe than the Second Amended Judgment. 
The Circuit Court denied the 2013 Petition without a hearing, and
 this appeal followed.
 
DISCUSSION
 
On appeal, Cornelio argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
in denying his 2013 Petition without a hearing because the
 sentences imposed after the Second Amended Judgment violated HRS 
§ 706-609. Cornelio does not challenge his mandatory minimum
 terms of imprisonment, which have already expired, but only his
 indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment. Cornelio contends
 that "once he was correctly sentenced" to a total indeterminate
 term of imprisonment of fifteen years in the Second Amended
 Judgment, he could not be resentenced more severely for the same
 offenses.
 
Cornelio's argument fails because it is based on the
 
erroneous assumption that the sentence reflected in the Second
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Amended Judgment is a valid and proper sentence to use in 
applying HRS § 706-609. As noted, HRS § 706-609 provides, in relevant part: "When a conviction or sentence is set aside on direct or collateral attack, the court shall not impose a new sentence for the same offense . . . which is more severe than the prior sentence." Cornelio filed a direct appeal of his sentence, which imposed consecutive indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment totaling forty years, as well as consecutive mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. On direct appeal, Cornelio did not challenge his consecutive indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment, but only his consecutive mandatory minimum terms. Therefore, the supreme court only addressed Cornelio's mandatory minimum terms. The supreme court held that the consecutive mandatory minimum terms as to Counts Two through Five were improper. Cornelio, 84 Hawai
'i at 480, 494, 935 P.2d at 
1025, 1039. Accordingly, it vacated Cornelio's sentence with respect to Counts Two through Five, and it remanded the case to the Circuit Court for resentencing as to those counts in a manner consistent with its opinion. Id. at 495, 935 P.2d at 1040. 
However, despite Cornelio's failure to challenge his
 
indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment on appeal, and even
 though the supreme court's opinion did not indicate any
 impropriety in the imposition of consecutive indeterminate
 maximum terms of imprisonment on Counts Two through Five, the
 Circuit Court on remand entered the Second Amended Judgment which
 changed the indeterminate terms of imprisonment for Counts Two
 through Five from running consecutively to running concurrently. 
The State subsequently moved to correct the sentence, and it
 represented that Cornelio's counsel acknowledged that the Second
 Amended Judgment was inaccurate and needed to be corrected. The
 Circuit Court granted the State's motion and entered the Third
 Amended Judgment, which imposed all indeterminate terms of
 imprisonment consecutively, for a total of forty years. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under the circumstances, it is clear that the Circuit
 
Court's changing the indeterminate maximum terms of imprisonment
 
on Counts Two through Five from consecutive to concurrent in the
 Second Amended Judgment was inconsistent with the supreme court's
 opinion and therefore, was improper. The Circuit Court corrected
 this error in the Third Amended Judgment, which consistent with
 the supreme court's opinion imposed consecutive indeterminate
 terms of imprisonment on Counts Two through Five.
 
With respect to the Third Amended Judgment, for
 
purposes of HRS § 706-609, the proper comparison is between the
 sentence imposed before the supreme court's opinion and the
 sentence imposed after the supreme court's opinion. The sentence
 imposed before the supreme court's opinion was a total
 indeterminate maximum term of imprisonment of forty years, which
 is the same sentence imposed by the Third Amended Judgment. 
Therefore, the Third Amended Judgment did not "impose a new
 sentence for the same offense . . . which is more severe than the
 prior sentence," and the Circuit Court did not violate HRS § 706­609 in entering the Third Amended Judgment. 
After this court's 2008 Memorandum Opinion, which 
considered the sentence imposed by the Third Amended Judgment,
 the Circuit Court dismissed Count Four and entered the Fourth
 Amended Judgment, which reduced Cornelio's total indeterminate
 maximum term of imprisonment from forty years to thirty years. 
The Fourth Amended Judgment, which sets forth Cornelio's current
 sentence, is not more severe than the Third Amended Judgment and
 did not violate HRS § 706-609. Accordingly, we conclude that
 Cornelio's claim that his sentence is illegal because it was
 imposed in violation of HRS § 706-609 is without merit.

2Cornelio also suggests that HRS § 706-606.5 precluded the
imposition of consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment on
his convictions. This claim is likewise without merit. HRS §
706-606.5 governs the imposition of mandatory minimum terms of
imprisonment for repeat offenders and does not control the
imposition of indeterminate terms of imprisonment. HRS 
§ 706-668.5 controls the imposition of indeterminate terms of

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Circuit
