APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-000132)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
do not have appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case
 
number CAAP-13-0005314, in which Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/
 Third-Party Defendant/Appellant/Cross-Appellee William R. Hancock
 (Appellant Hancock) and Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Cross-
Claim Plaintiff/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellant
 Kulana Partners, LLC (Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners), appeal
 from the Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano's October 22, 2013
 judgment (Judgment), because the Judgment does not satisfy the
 requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013), Rules 54(b) 
and 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the 
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has held that, 
"[a]lthough [Rules of the Circuit Court of the State of Hawai 'i 
Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. 
Obayashi Hawaii Corp., 81 Hawai
'i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 
(1996) (emphasis added). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties,  the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
"For example: 'pursuant to the jury verdict entered on (date), 
judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I through IV of the complaint. . . . . [A]ll other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed.'" Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1338-39 n.4. When interpreting the requirements for a judgment
 
under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.

Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Consequently, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as 
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original 
emphasis). 
We note that on February 15, 2012, we entered a
 
memorandum opinion in appellate court case number 30139 that
 vacated the circuit court's August 3, 2009 HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or
 parties, but our February 15, 2012 memorandum opinion neither
 addressed nor altered an October 23, 2009 HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or
 parties, which remained in effect. Because the October 23, 2009
 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment adjudicated all of claims in
 Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellees/Cross-Appellees
 Robert Grinpas's and Esther Grinpas's (the Grinpas Appellees)
 complaint as to Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee/Cross-
Appellee Kapaa 382, LLC (Appellee Kapaa 382) and Appellant
 Hancock, the subsequent Judgment needed only to adjudicate the
 other remaining and unresolved claims in this case by and between
 the Grinpas Appellees, Appellant Hancock, Cross-Appellant Kulana
 Partners, and Appellee Kapaa 382. However, the Judgment does not
 either enter judgment on or dismiss all of the remaining claims. 
Although the Judgment enters judgment on most of the remaining
 claims, it does not utilize operative language to either enter
 judgment on or dismiss the following four claims, which,
 therefore, remain unresolved in this case:
 
(1)	 Count VII (misnumbered as "Count VI") of Cross-Claim Kulana
Partners' amended cross-claim against Appellee Kapaa 382 and
Appellant Hancock (which the Judgment simply states is
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"moot" in light of the fact that the [Judgment] enters
judgment in favor of Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners and
against Appellant Hancock and Appellee Kapaa 382 as to Count
I of Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners' cross-claim against
Appellant Hancock and Appellee Kapaa 382);
 
(2)	 Count II of Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners' third-party
complaint against Appellant Hancock (which the [Judgment]
does not address, and, thus, the [Judgment] does not enter
judgment on or dismiss Count II);
 
(3)	 Count IV of Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners' third-party
complaint against Appellant Hancock (which the [Judgment]
simply states is "moot" in light of the fact that the
[Judgment] enters judgment in favor of Cross-Appellant
Kulana Partners and against Appellant Hancock as to Count I
of Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners' third-party complaint
against Appellant Hancock); and
 
(4)	 Count IX (misnumbered as "Count VI") of Cross-Appellant
Kulana Partners' third-party complaint against Appellant
Hancock (which the [Judgment] simply states is "moot" in
light of the fact that the [Judgment] enters judgment in
favor of Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners and against
Appellant Hancock as to Count I of Cross-Appellant Kulana
Partners' third-party complaint against Appellant Hancock).
 
Despite that the Judgment does not resolve all of the remaining
 
claims, it does not contain an express finding of no just reason
 for a delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer
 than all claims or parties, as HRCP Rule 54(b) requires. The
 Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has specifically explained that a 
circuit court must contain operative language that either enters
 judgment on or dismisses each claim:
 
A statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Because the Judgment neither resolves all the
 
remaining claims nor contains an express finding of no just
 reason for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but
 fewer than all claims or parties, the Judgment does not satisfy
 the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS
 § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in
 Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment, Appellant 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hancock's and Cross-Appellant Kulana Partners' appeals are
 
premature and we lack jurisdiction over appellate court case
 number CAAP-13-0005314. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0005314 (which is consolidated over CAAP-13-0005554) is
 dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
