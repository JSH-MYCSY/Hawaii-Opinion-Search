IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GARY K. MATA, SR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-0167)
 
ORDER GRANTING FEBRUARY 14, 2014 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii's
 
(Appellee State) February 14, 2014 motion to dismiss appellate
 
court case number CAAP-13-0005354 for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by counsel for
 Defendant-Appellant Gary K. Mata, Sr. (Appellant Mata), in
 opposition to Appellee State's February 14, 2014 motion, and
 (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over Appellant Mata's appeal from the Honorable Randal G.B.
 Valenciano's December 11, 2013 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 Law and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Indictment
 Pursuant to Rule 48 and Speedy Trial" (the December 11, 2013
 dismissal order), because the December 11, 2013 dismissal order
 does not contain a sentence, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 641-11 (Supp. 2013) requires for an appeal from a circuit court
 criminal case.
 
"Appellate jurisdiction in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." State v. Baxley, 102 Hawai
'i 130, 133, 73 
P.3d 668, 671 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted). The supreme court has
 
enumerated several bases for jurisdiction from a circuit
court judgment, stating that, in a criminal case, a
defendant may appeal from the judgment of the circuit court
. . . (1) pursuant to HRS § 641-11, (2) from an
interlocutory order . . . pursuant to HRS § 641-17, (3) by
virtue of the collateral order doctrine, . . .
(4) by applying for a writ of prohibition or mandamus under
HRS § 602-5(4), . . . and (5) by requesting exercise of this
court's supervisory powers pursuant to HRS § 602-4[.]
 
Id. at 139, 73 P.3d at 677 (citations, internal quotation marks,
 
original brackets, and footnote omitted). Counsel for Appellant
 
Mata has not asserted that the relevant statute under the
 circumstances of the instant case is any statute other than HRS
 § 641-11, which
 
provides in part that any party deeming oneself aggrieved by
the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, mayappeal to the supreme court. (Emphasis added.) Judgment isdefined in HRS § 641-11 as the sentence of the court in acriminal case. Thus, by the terms of HRS § 641-11, theappealable action of the circuit court is the sentence. As we concluded in [State v.] Kealaiki[, 95 Hawai' i 309, 312,
22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001)], the sentence of the court in acriminal case is the judgment from which an appeal isauthorized, and where there is no conviction and sentence. . . , there can be no appeal under HRS § 641-11 . . . .Accordingly, inasmuch as Defendant appeals from the judgmentof acquittal, for which there is no sentence, there can beno jurisdiction under HRS § 641-11. 
Baxley, 102 Hawai 'i at 139-40, 73 P.3d at 677-78 (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and original brackets omitted); see
 
also State v. Ferreira, 54 Haw. 485, 487, 510 P.2d 88, 89 (1973)
 (Where a judgment of conviction does not include a sentence,
 then, under HRS § 641-11, "for purposes of appeal, we are of the
 opinion that the judgment entered in this case is not a final
 judgment conferring appellate jurisdiction on this court." 
(Footnote omitted)); State v. Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 11, 619 P.2d
 1076, 1077 (1980) ("In the instant case, appellant brought this
 appeal from the First Circuit Court's order denying is motion to
 dismiss the indictment. We hold that such an order is
 interlocutory and is not a final order or judgment. It is
 therefore not one that is appealable under HRS § 641-11."); State
 v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai
'i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) ("There 
having been no conviction and sentence in this case, there can be
 no appeal under HRS § 641-11 from the . . . order granting
 Defendant's plea deferral").

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the instant case, the December 11, 2013 dismissal
 
order finally ended this circuit court criminal case by
 
dismissing Appellee State's indictment against Appellant Mata
 without prejudice. Understandably, the December 11, 2013
 dismissal order contains no sentence, but the lack of any
 sentence in the December 11, 2013 dismissal order means that it
 does not qualify as an appealable judgment under the plain
 meaning of HRS § 641-11. Consequently, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over Appellant Mata's appeal in appellate court case
 number CAAP-13-0005354. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee State's February 14,
 
2014 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-13­0005354 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005354 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
