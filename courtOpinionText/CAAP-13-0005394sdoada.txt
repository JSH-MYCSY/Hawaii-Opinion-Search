IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JOSHUA JAMES MEDEIROS, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1SD13-1-8)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Peitioner-Appellant Joshua James Medeiros (Medeiros), 
pro se, appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, 
and Order, entered on October 31, 2013 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court), denying his Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody (Petition).
1 
On November 16, 2007, Medeiros was convicted of
 
Disorderly Conduct in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 ยง 711-1101 (2014) after the charge was amended from Harassment in
 violation of HRS ยง 711-1106 (Supp. 2008).
 
Medeiros filed his May 24, 2013 Petition, alleging that
 
he entered his guilty plea without understanding the nature of
 the charge and consequences of the plea, his conviction was
 coerced by the prosecutor, and he was provided with ineffective
 assistance of counsel. On October 31, 2013, the District Court
 denied the Petition.

Medeiros contends on appeal that the District Court
 
erred in denying his Petition because (1) there was no evidence
 
to show that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered
 his plea and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Medeiros's points of error as follows:
 
"If a petition alleges facts that if proven would
 
entitle the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a hearing
 which may extend only to the issues raised in the petition or
 answer." HRPP Rule 40(f).
 
As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40
petition for post-conviction relief where the petition
states a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim,
the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as
true the facts alleged would change the verdict, however, a
petitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true.
 
Barnett v. State, 91 Hawai 'i 20, 26, 979 P.2d 1046, 1052 (1999) 
(quoting State v. Allen, 7 Haw. App. 89, 92-93, 744 P.2d 789, 
792-93 (1987)). 
Medeiros alleged that he did not knowingly,
 
voluntarily, and intelligently plead guilty because (1) he did
 not understand the nature of the charge and the consequences of
 his plea insofar as he did not understand that he would
 thereafter not be able to possess a firearm; (2) his plea was
 coerced by the prosecutor's promise that the harassment charge
 would be dismissed if he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct
 whereas if he refused to plead, the State would proceed on the
 harassment charge and ask for jail time although the victim of
 the offense (Medeiros's brother) refused to testify; and (3) he
 was not afforded effective assistance of counsel because the
 attorney "provided little to no assistance in my case," and told
 Medeiros that "he had a lot of cases to work on and didn't think
 it was worth his time to lose at trial" even though Medeiros said
 he wanted to go to court and testify.
 
It appears that Medeiros's attorney's files of
 
Medeiros's 2007 case have been destroyed and Medeiros's 2007
 change of plea hearing was inadvertently not recorded. Thus the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
unavailability of the transcript of Medeiros's change of plea is
 
not due to any delay by Medeiros in filing his petition. The
 existing record of Medeiros's HRPP Rule 40 proceeding is silent
 as to whether Medeiros knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently
 entered his plea. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has said, 
In a petition seeking relief under Rule 40 on ground
that the guilty plea was entered into involuntarily, the
court is required to look at the entire record in order to
determine whether the petitioner's claims or recantation are
credible and worthy of belief. The record is vital to the
 ultimate determination of whether the plea was made
voluntarily; as this court has repeatedly emphasized, it
will not presume from a silent record a waiver of a
constitutional right. Medeiros v. State, 63 Haw. 162, 623
P.2d 86 (1981); Mara v. Naauao, 51 Haw. 322, 459 P.2d 382
(1969). A silent record or a minimal record places the
burden on the State to prove waiver. Medeiros, supra. In
 
the absence of a silent or minimal record, the burden is on
petitioner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that
his constitutional right was not voluntarily and
intelligently waived. Id.
 
Eli v. State, 63 Haw. 474, 477, 630 P.2d 113, 116 (1981). 
Here, Medeiros stated a colorable claim that entitled 
him to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that he did not 
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently plead guilty. Medeiros alleged that he did not understand the nature of the charge and the consequences of his guilty plea and that he was "coerced" into entering his plea because the prosecutor told him that the State would proceed against him on the harassment charge and seek incarceration if he did not enter a guilty plea to the disorderly conduct charge, even though the victim refused to testify. "Manifest injustice occurs when a defendant makes a plea involuntarily or without knowledge of the direct consequences of the plea." State v. Nguyen, 81 Hawai
'i 279, 292, 916 P.2d 689, 
702 (1996). 
Medeiros also stated a colorable claim for ineffective
 
assistance of counsel. Medeiros alleged that his counsel told
 him it was not worth counsel's time to go to trial and lose in
 spite of Medeiros's desire to testify. See Cacatian v. State, 70
 
Haw. 402, 404, 772 P.2d 691 692-93 (1989) (remand for hearing
 where petitioner alleged his counsel prevented him from
 testifying at trial).
 
Where Medeiros presented colorable claims and there was
 
no record of his plea, it was error to rule on the petition

without an evidentiary hearing to determine the circumstances of
 
Medeiros's plea.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, entered on October 31, 2013
 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division is
 vacated. The case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on
 Medeiros's claims that he did not knowingly, voluntarily, and
 intelligently plead guilty and that he received ineffective
 assistance of counsel.
