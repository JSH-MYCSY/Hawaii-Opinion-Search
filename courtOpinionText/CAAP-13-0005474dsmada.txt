APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0318(3))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendants/
 
Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellants
 Kaleialoha Lukela (Appellant Kaleialoha Lukela) and Rosabella
 Hoopii (Appellant Rosabella Hoopii) have asserted from the
 Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza's November 4, 2013 judgment, because
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the November 4, 2013 judgment does not satisfy the requirements 
for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 
1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 
listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the specificity requirements for an appealable
 final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme
 Court of Hawai
'i explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis; 
citation omitted). Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that 
is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
Although this case involves multiple claims by way of
 
the four separate and distinct counts in the first amended
 complaint, the two separate and distinct counts in Appellant
 Kaleialoha Lukela and Appellant Rosabella Hoopii's counterclaim,
 and the two separate and distinct counts in Appellant Kaleialoha
 Lukela and Appellant Rosabella Hoopii's cross-claim, the
 November 4, 2013 judgment does not specifically identify the
 claim or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter
 judgment. Therefore, the November 4, 2013 judgment is too vague
 to satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment
 under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins.

Absent an appealable final judgment in this case,
 
Appellant Kaleialoha Lukela and Appellant Rosabella Hoopii's
 
appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction over
 appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005474. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0005474 is dismissed for lack of
 jurisdiction.
