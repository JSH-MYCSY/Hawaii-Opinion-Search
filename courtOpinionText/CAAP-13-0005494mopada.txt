TIFFANY LEI PAREL, Appellant-Appellant, v.
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES,
STATE OF HAWAII, Appellee-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0644 (GKN))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal, Plaintiff-Appellant Tiffany 
Lei Parel (Parel) appeals from the October 22, 2013 Judgment 
(Judgment), and challenges the August 30, 2013 Order Affirming Administrative Hearing Decision Dated November 30, 2012 (Order), both entered in favor of State of Hawai
'i Defendant-Appellee 
Department of Human Services (DHS) and against Parel, in the 
1
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).  In the 
proceedings below, a DHS investigation determined that Parel 
neglected a 74-year old female resident (Client) at Hale Ho 'ola 
Hamakua nursing facility (Facility). After an evidentiary

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
hearing, a hearing officer from the Administrative Appeals Office
 
of DHS submitted a Notice of Administrative Hearing Decision
 (Hearing Decision), which included findings of fact and concluded
 
that DHS had correctly confirmed neglect by Parel. The Circuit
 
Court affirmed the Hearing Decision.
 I. BACKGROUND
 
In 2005, Parel secured employment as a Certified
 
Nurse's Aid (CNA) with the Facility. Parel was responsible for
 
transferring patients in and out of bed, helping patients shower,
 
taking vitals, helping patients in their daily living, feeding
 patients, and changing patients. 
On July 18, 2012, the Adult Protective and Community
 
Services Branch of DHS (APS) received a report alleging that
 
Client had fallen while under the care of Parel (Abuse Report). 
The Abuse Report provided that Client fell and sustained two
 
black eyes, a skinned knee, and a left shoulder fracture. The
 Abuse Report was accepted for investigation by DHS, and an APS
 social worker conducted an investigation. 
On July 23, 2012, APS received a copy of the Department
 
of Health's Office of Healthcare Assurance report from Director
 of Nursing Carmela Rice (Rice), and Nurse Manager Chelseamay
 
Holley (Holley) (DOH report). The DOH report included Parel's
 handwritten statement, dated July 17, 2012, and typed statement,
 
dated July 18, 2012. In her statements, Parel related that she
 placed Client on the right side of the bed and, as she was
 reaching for Client's gait belt at the end of the bed, "[Client] 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
started shaking rapidly. Her whole body got stiff and lunged
 
front and fell to the ground." 
The DOH report also included a statement from Client's
 
daughter, Melanie Mamhot (Mamhot). Mamhot related that Parel
 
told her two versions of how Client fell. In the first version,
 
Parel told Mamhot that Client was in a seated position prior to
 her fall. In the second version, Parel told Mamhot that Client
 was standing prior to her fall. 
The DOH report also included Licensed Practical Nurse
 
Monalisa Batalona's (Batalona) statement. On the day of the
 
incident, Batalona related that Parel entered Client's room and
 
"about a minute later, [Parel] was yelling for me." When
 Batalona entered Client's room, she observed Client on the
 ground. Batalona related that "[Parel] told [her] that [Client]
 was standing up and she was holding her hands . . . transferring
 her to shower chair. Then [Client] started to seized [sic] and
 fell to the floor." When asked "[d]id you notice if she had the
 gait belt on[,]" Batalona responded, "[n]o, she did not have it
 on, because I did not see it on her when we transferred her back
 to the bed." When asked "[d]id you see the gait [belt] on the
 bed or floor," Batalona answered, "[n]o, I did not notice where
 the gait belt was." 
On July 23, 2012, APS visited Client at the Facility. 
APS attempted to interview Client about the fall on July 14,
 2012. However, when Client was asked questions about the fall,
 she "laughed, showing clear signs of confusion[.]" As such, APS
 determined that Client was not able to participate in the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interview. APS photographed Client's "right forehead hematoma,
 
facial bruising, bruising on both hands, and right knee
 abrasion." 
On July 27, 2012, and July 30, 2012, APS interviewed
 
staff at the Facility about Client's fall, "their knowledge about
 and experience with [Client,] and the procedure they would follow
 in transferring [Client.]" APS interviewed Carmelita Acob, Nori
 Acidera, Beverly Nacnac, Alice Saturay, Tina Tabucbuc, Clarence
 Augustin, Judyvon "Von" Ganir, and Paskislina Steele. 
On July 31, 2012, APS interviewed Parel. Parel related
 
that on July 14, 2012, she entered Client's room "with the shower
 chair and grabbed [Client's] clothes and gait belt." Parel
 related that the "gait belt was on her right, near the foot of
 the bed[.]" As Parel reached for the gait belt with her right
 hand, she "saw 'something' to her left." Parel "gestured that
 her head was turned to the right, away from [Client.]" Parel
 explained that she "initially said [Client] was standing because
 she saw movement from the left." Parel declined APS's request to
 provide a written statement. Instead, Parel amended her July 17,
 2012 statement to add that she reached for the gait belt with her
 right hand. 
On August 7, 2012, APS interviewed Batalona via
 
telephone. Batalona related that on the day of Client's fall,
 she entered Client's room and observed Client "on the floor, body
 shaking, eyes rolled back and tongue sticking out." Batalona
 related that the "shower chair was near the foot of the bed,
 about a foot away and [Client] did not have the gait belt on." 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Batalona stated that "she did not see a gait belt on the foot of
 
the bed, anywhere on the bed, or on the floor." Batalona
 reiterated that Parel "stated that she was transferring [Client]
 to the shower chair, had [Client] standing in a hand held grasp,
 when [Client's] legs stiffened up and she fell forward." 
Batalona related that "she had no reason to lie (about CNA Parel)
 [and that] she was reporting exactly what happened." 
On August 21, 2012, APS visited the Facility and
 
photographed Client's room. APS also asked Rice and Holley to
 demonstrate how they would transfer a Client "from bed to shower
 chair and from bed to ambulation." Following the demonstration,
 APS concluded that if Parel "stood in front of [Client] while
 [Client] sat on the right side of the bed, CNA Parel could have
 prevented [Client's] fall, even if CNA Parel reached for the gait
 belt at the foot of the bed[.]" Additionally, APS concluded that
 the "use of the gait belt during transfers from the bed and
 during ambulation is a necessary device . . . and failure to use
 this device would have placed [Client] at a high risk for fall
 and injury[.]" Based on the demonstration, APS concluded that
 Client was most likely standing (as Parel had informed Batalona
 and Mamhot), without the gait belt on. 
Following the investigation, DHS issued a Notice of 
Disposition Adult Protective Services Investigation (Notice of 
Disposition) on September 4, 2012. The Notice of Disposition confirmed caregiver neglect by Parel under Hawai
'i Administrative 
Rules (HAR) § 17-1421-9.1(c) (2009). 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On or about September 7, 2012, Parel requested an
 
administrative hearing to contest DHS's determination of
 
caregiver neglect. 
On October 22, 2012, DHS issued its Notice of
 
Videoconference Hearing (Hearing Notice), notifying Parel that
 
the hearing was scheduled for November 8, 2012. The Hearing
 
Notice provided that the "hearing will be held on an informal
 basis in accordance with Chapter 91 of the Hawaii Revised
 Statutes [(HRS)] and Chapters 17-2 and 17-1402 of the [HAR]." 
An Internal Communication Form (ICF) was attached to
 
the Hearing Notice. The ICF provided a detailed description of
 DHS's investigation, and DHS's position statements. DHS's
 position was that Parel was "'negligent' in [Client] care by not
 following the proper procedure in transferring the [Client] from
 the bed to shower chair, which resulted in the [Client] falling
 and suffering injury to [Client's] head, knee, hand, and
 shoulder." DHS's position was that "Parel's actions meet the HRS
 346-222 definition of 'caregiver neglect' as she failed to
 exercise a degree of care for a vulnerable adult that a
 reasonable person would have done as outlined in [Client]
 contractual duties." 
On November 8, 2012, an administrative hearing
 
(Hearing) was held via video conference before Clayton Kimoto,
 
Hearing Officer for the Administrative Appeals Office of DHS
 
(Hearing Officer). At the beginning of the Hearing, the Hearing
 
Officer related that he was not involved in DHS's investigation,
 
and that his decision would be based on the evidence presented at
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Hearing. The Hearing Officer informed Parel that she has
 
"the right to inspect and cross-examine the evidence submitted by
 [DHS.]" The Hearing Officer explained that "everyone who gives
 testimony at this hearing must tell the truth and nothing but the
 truth." The Hearing Officer stated that DHS "will give its
 presentation first, and then, Ms. Parel, you can, through your
 attorney or whoever, you can ask questions, cross-examine, or
 make your presentation[.]" The Hearing Officer then read
 exhibits into the record. 
DHS Supervisor Timothy Kitagawa (Kitagawa) presented
 
evidence on behalf of DHS. Kitagawa summarized DHS's
 investigation, and reiterated DHS's position. Next, Parel's
 counsel called APS Specialist Laron Kageyama (Kageyama) as his
 
first witness. Kageyama testified that he has worked for APS for
 
seven years. Kageyama related that he conducts four to five
 investigations a month. Kageyama could not confirm whether
 Client's seizure occurred before or after her fall. Kageyama
 related that Mamhot and Batalona's statements varied from Parel's
 statements about Client's fall. Kageyama testified that Batalona
 related that Client was not wearing a gait belt, and that she
 "did not notice where the gait belt was." Kageyama confirmed
 that Batalona was the only witness who stated that the gait belt
 was not on the bed or floor. Kageyama was aware that there was
 animosity between Parel and her coworkers. Kageyama explained
 that he was cautious and only used statements from coworkers that
 "appeared to be factual." 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Parel also testified at the Hearing. Parel testified
 
that she started working at the Facility in 2005. Parel related
 
that on July 14, 2012, she was going to help Client take a
 shower. Parel placed Client in a seated position, and reached
 for the gait belt that was "hanging on the closet." Parel
 testified that as she "reached over to grab the gait belt, that's
 when I saw [Client] standing -- like I saw in the side of my eye
 she was standing, and then when I turned around she was just like
 . . . [h]aving a seizure[.]" Parel related that she tried to
 "reach for" or "catch" Client before she fell on the floor. 
When Parel's counsel asked about her prior inconsistent
 statements, Parel replied "What I'm saying is the truth." After
 Client's fall, Parel told Mamhot that she "was sorry that her mom
 had a seizure and fell down and I tried to catch her." The next
 day, Parel again apologized to Client's daughter. 
Following Parel's testimony, DHS and Parel's counsel
 
restated their respective positions and the Hearing Officer
 concluded the Hearing. On November 30, 2012, Hearing Officer
 issued the Hearing Decision. The Hearing Officer determined that
 DHS properly confirmed that Parel had committed caregiver
 neglect. 
On December 24, 2012, Parel filed a Notice of Appeal to 
Circuit Court under HRS § 91-14 and Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 72. After briefing and oral argument, the Circuit Court affirmed the Hearing Decision and determined that "reversal or modification of the administrative hearing decision is not 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
warranted under the standards set forth in [HRS] section 91­
14(g)[.]" The Circuit Court entered the Order on August 30,
 2013. 
On October 22, 2013, the Circuit Court entered the
 
Judgment. On November 21, 2013, Parel filed her notice of
 appeal. 
II.	 POINTS OF ERROR 
On this appeal, Parel identifies three points of error,
 
summarized as follows: (1) DHS violated its statutory authority
 by holding an administrative hearing and finding that Parel
 committed caregiver abuse; and (2 & 3) the Hearing Decision was
 clearly erroneous and constituted an abuse of discretion. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"The review of a circuit court's decision regarding its
 
review of an administrative agency's decision is a secondary
 appeal." 
Pila'a 400, LLC v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. , 132 Hawai 'i 
247, 262, 320 P.3d 912, 927 (2014) (citing Haw. Teamsters &
 Allied Workers, Local 966 v. Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations,
 110 Hawai
'i 259, 265, 132 P.3d 368, 374 (2006)). 
"On secondary judicial review of an administrative
decision, Hawaii appellate courts apply the same standard of
review as that applied upon primary review by the circuit
court." Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor &
Indus. Relations, 70 Haw. 72, 80, 762 P.2d 796, 800-01
(1988). For administrative appeals, the applicable standard
of review is set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) (2004), which
provides:
 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1) 	In violation of constitutional or
 
statutory provisions; or
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) 	In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) 	Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4) 	Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5) 	Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or 
(6) 	Arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion. 
Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g)(5), 
administrative findings of fact are reviewed
under the clearly erroneous standard, which
requires [the appellate] court to sustain its
findings unless the court is left with a firm
and definite conviction that a mistake has been
 made. Administrative conclusions of law,
however, are reviewed under the de novo standard
inasmuch as they are not binding on an appellate
court. Where both mixed questions of fact and
law are presented, deference will be given to
the agency's expertise and experience in the
particular field and the court should not
substitute its own judgment for that of the
agency. To be granted deference, however, the
agency's decision must be consistent with the
legislative purpose.

AlohaCare v. Ito, 126 Hawai 'i 326, 341, 271 P.3d 621, 636 (2012). 
IV.	 DISCUSSION
 
Parel argues that: (1) DHS violated its statutory
 
mandate by holding an administrative hearing; (2) DHS lacked the
 
regulatory authority to conduct an administrative hearing; (3)
 her due process rights were violated; and (4) the Hearing
 Decision was clearly erroneous and constituted an abuse of
 discretion.
 
A.	 Statutory Authority
 Parel argues that DHS "violated its statutory mandate
 
by conducting an administrative hearing instead of following the
 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
applicable statute and pursuing the matter in the Family
 
Court[.]"  DHS contends that Parel did not raise this argument
 
before the Circuit Court and thus, the argument is waived on
 
appeal. However, the "lack of jurisdiction over the subject
 matter cannot be waived by the parties." Chun v. Emps.' Ret.
 
Sys. of the State of Hawaii, 73 Haw. 9, 14, 828 P.2d 260, 263
 (1992) (quoting 
In re Application of Rice, 68 Haw. 334, 335, 713
 
P.2d 426, 427 (1986)). Thus, we consider Parel's argument.
 
Under HRS § 346-227 (2015), DHS is required to initiate
 
2
an investigation upon receiving a report of abuse  of a
vulnerable adult.
3 An investigation is defined as "the
 
professional and systematic gathering and evaluation of
 information about the vulnerable adult for the purpose of making
 decisions regarding confirmation of abuse, protection of the
 
2
 Pursuant to HRS § 346-222 (2015): 
"Abuse" means any of the following, separately or in
combination: 
(1)	 Physical abuse;
(2)	 Psychological abuse;
(3)	 Sexual abuse;
(4)	 Financial exploitation;
(5)	 Caregiver neglect; or
(6) Self-neglect;
each as further defined in this chapter. Abuse does not
include, and a determination of abuse shall not be based

solely on, physical, psychological, or financial conditions
that result when a vulnerable adult seeks, or when a
caregiver provides or permits to be provided, treatment with
the express consent of the vulnerable adult or in accordance
with the vulnerable adult's religious or spiritual
practices.
 
3
 HRS § 346-222 defines a "vulnerable adult" as a person eighteen
years of age or older who, because of mental, developmental, or physical
impairment is unable to:
(1)	 Communicate or make responsible decisions to manage
the person's own care or resources;
(2)	 Carry out or arrange for essential life activities of
daily living; or
(3)	 Protect oneself from abuse, as defined in this part.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
vulnerable adult, and the provision of services for the
 
vulnerable adult." HAR § 17-1421-2 (2009). Following an
 investigation:
 
[DHS] shall take action to prevent abuse and shall
have the authority to do any or all of the following:
(1) 	Resolve the matter in an informal fashion as is
 
appropriate under the circumstances;
(2)	 Exercise its right of entry under section
346-229;
(3) 	Seek an order for immediate protection;
(4) 	Seek a temporary restraining order;
(5) 	File a petition with the court under this part;
and 
(6) 	Seek any protective or remedial actions
authorized by law. 
HRS § 346-228 (2015). 
On appeal, Parel argues that DHS was "statutorily
 
required to conduct further proceedings in the applicable Family
 
Court." In support of her argument, Parel relies on HRS § 346­223 (2015), which states: 
The family court shall have jurisdiction over
protective proceedings under this part that concern a
vulnerable adult who was or is found within the judicial
circuit at the time the facts and circumstances occurred,
were discovered, or were reported to the department, which
constitute the basis for a finding that the vulnerable adult
has incurred abuse or is in danger of abuse if immediate
action is not taken; provided that the protective
proceedings under this part shall not be considered
exclusive and shall not preclude any other criminal, civil,
or administrative remedy. The protective proceedings under
this part shall be held in the judicial circuit in which the
vulnerable adult resides at the time of the filing of the
petition or in which the vulnerable adult has assets.
 
(Emphasis added). 
However, pursuant to HRS § 346-228 (as quoted above),
 
following an investigation of a report alleging abuse, DHS is
 
authorized, but not required, to seek an order of immediate
 protection or file a petition with family court. DHS submits
 that it did not file a protective proceeding in Family Court
 because Parel was suspended from her position at the Facility and
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
13Client was moved to a different wing of the facility.  Thus,
Family Court intervention was not necessary to protect the
Client.  
Even if DHS had filed a protective proceeding, HRS
§ 346-223 clearly provides that "the protective proceedings under
this part shall not be considered exclusive and shall not
preclude any other criminal, civil, or administrative remedy." 
It is well established that "the fundamental starting point for
statutory interpretation is the language of the statute
itself[,]" and "where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and
obvious meaning."  Haw. Gov't Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME Local 152 v.
Lingle, 124 Hawai# i 197, 202, 239 P.3d 1, 6 (2010) (quoting
Awakuni v. Awana , 115 Hawai #i 126, 133, 165 P.3d 1027, 1034
(2007)).  Under the plain language of HRS § 346-223, a family
court action is not mandated.  Parel fails to provide any further
argument supporting her assertion that DHS was statutorily
required to conduct further proceedings in family court.
Therefore, we conclude that Parel's argument is without merit.
B.Regulatory Authority
Parel next argues that DHS failed to adopt any
administrative rules or amend existing rules that would allow it
to conduct administrative hearings into allegations of abuse,
raising three contentions:  (1) DHS was required to file an
action in Family Court under HAR § 17-1421-11 (2009); (2) DHS did
not adopt "established hearing procedures" as required by HAR   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 17-1421-9.1(c)(3); and (3) DHS "failed to promulgate criteria
 
and standards concerning what would constitute 'caregiver
 abuse.'" 
First, HAR § 17-1421-11 provides that DHS "shall
 
initiate court action by petitioning for an order for immediate
 protection when, in accordance with sections 346-231 and 346-232,
 HRS, [DHS] determines that there is a reason to believe the
 vulnerable adult has incurred abuse or is in danger of abuse if
 immediate action is not taken." HRS § 346-231 (2015) pertains to
 an order for immediate protection. HRS § 346-232 (2015) pertains
 to an order to show cause hearing following the issuance of an
 order for immediate protection. As discussed above, DHS is
 authorized, but not required, to seek an order of immediate
 protection in Family Court. HRS § 346-228. Therefore, we
 conclude that Parel's first contention is without merit. 
Second, Parel contends that DHS did not adopt 
"established hearing procedures" as required by HAR § 17-1421­9.1(c)(3). DHS argues that Parel did not raise this argument before the Circuit Court, and thus, the argument is waived on appeal. An appellate court "will consider new arguments on appeal where justice so requires." State v. Moses, 102 Hawai
'i 
449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). "[T]he appellate court's discretion to address plain error is always to be exercised sparingly." Okada Trucking Co., v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 
Hawai
'i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). An appellate court 
considers three factors in its decision to review an issue for plain error, "(1) whether consideration of the issue not raised 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at trial requires additional facts; (2) whether its resolution
 
will affect the integrity of the trial court's findings of fact;
 and (3) whether the issue is of great public import." Id.
 
(citation omitted).
 
The first factor is "based on the tenet that an 
appellate court should not review an issue based upon an undeveloped factual record." Alvarez Family Tr. v. Ass'n of 
Apartment Owners of the Kaanapali Alii, 121 Hawai
'i 474, 490, 221 
P.3d 452, 468 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Parel's contention that DHS failed to adopt "established hearing procedures" under HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c)(3) is a question of law, and thus, will not require additional facts. 
With regard to the second factor, the Circuit Court 
"[u]pon review of the administrative hearing decision, the evidence presented, and the applicable statutes and administrative rules," determined that "reversal or modification of the administrative hearing decision is not warranted under the standards set forth in [HRS] section 91-14(g)[.]" Thus, "there are no findings of fact whose integrity could be affected by the instant appeal[.]" Alvarez, 121 Hawai
'i at 491, 221 P.3d at 469 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the second factor is not applicable. Id. 
As to the third factor, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has 
observed that "in civil cases, an issue is of 'great public import' for the purposes of plain error review only when such issue affects the public interest." Id. In Alvarez, the supreme 
court determined that the issue of whether appellants had the 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
right to challenge the voting procedures of a condominium
 
association's board of directors was not a matter of "public
 interest" because "(1) such right is of a private nature and (2)
 the issue applies exclusively to the facts and circumstances of
 [appellant's] case." Id. at 492, 221 P.3d at 470. 
Here, Parel contends that DHS failed to establish 
hearing procedures under HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c), which requires DHS to issue a disposition following an investigation of a report alleging abuse. The disposition must include the "identified perpetrator's right to appeal [DHS's] disposition through established hearing procedures." HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c). An identified perpetrator's right to appeal a DHS disposition under HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c) is not an issue that applies exclusively to the facts and circumstances of Parel's case. Alvarez, 121 
Hawai
'i at 492, 221 P.3d at 470. Thus, the third factor of the 
plain error test is satisfied. Upon consideration of the three factors, we conclude that plain error review is not inappropriate and will consider Parel's argument that DHS failed to adopt "established hearing procedures" as required by HAR § 17-1421­9.1(c)(3). 
Pursuant to HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c)(3), DHS is required to
 
"provide a written notice on a prescribed department form to the
 identified perpetrator(s) of the disposition of the
 investigation." The written notice must include: (1) "[t]he
 department's decision to confirm or not confirm the allegations
 of vulnerable adult abuse"; (2) "[t]he specific rules supporting
 the action"; and (3) "[t]he identified perpetrator's right to
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal the department's disposition through established hearing
 
procedures." HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c). 
In the instant case, DHS issued its Notice of
 
Disposition confirming caregiver neglect by Parel under HAR § 17­1421-9.1, including notice to Parel of her right to appeal. The
 Notice of Disposition provides:
 
WHAT TO DO IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS DECISION: You
 
have a right to a meeting with a representative of the
Department's local office to discuss the disposition.
At the meeting, you may speak for yourself or be
represented by an attorney, friend, or other person.
You also have a right to ask for an administrative
hearing. Your request for an administrative hearing
must be in writing. Please use the attached form DHS
1617 to request an administrative hearing and send the
form to the address at the top of the form. The
Department must receive your written request for an
administrative hearing within 90 calendar days of the
date of this notice in order for you to receive a
hearing.
 
Parel completed the DHS 1617 form, and requested an
 
administrative hearing to contest DHS's determination of
 
caregiver neglect. DHS sent a Hearing Notice to inform Parel
 that her hearing was scheduled for November 8, 2012. The Hearing
 Notice also notified Parel that the "hearing will be held on an
 informal basis in accordance with Chapter 91 of the [HRS] and
 Chapters 17-2 and 17-1402 of the [HAR]." 
In Valdez, appellant challenged DHS's determination
 
that she abused a vulnerable adult. Valdez v. State, Dep't of
 
Human Serv., No. CAAP-12-0000121, 2014 WL 7190243, at *1 (Haw.
 App. Dec. 17, 2014) (SDO). Appellant's hearing notice referred
 to HRS chapter 91 and HAR § 17-1402, but failed to mention HAR
 § 17-2. Id. Appellant argued that "she did not know which
 
procedures to follow prior to the DHS hearing and, more
 specifically, that she did not know that she could subpoena
 
17
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
witnesses." Id. This court determined that DHS "erred in
 
referencing HAR § 17-1402, where the 'right to a hearing' is
 
described as applying to an 'applicant for or recipient of public
 assistance.'" Id. (citing HAR § 17-1402-4). However, this court
 
concluded that appellant's "substantial rights were not affected
 by the deficient notice and that her failure to raise an
 objection constituted a waiver of her right to subsequently
 complain about the absence of the witnesses." Id. (Footnote and
 
citations omitted). 
As in Valdez, DHS improperly referenced HAR § 17-1402
 
in its Hearing Notice. However, Parel was also notified that the
 hearing will be held in accordance with HAR chapter 17-2. HAR
 chapter 17-2 contains rules pertaining to notice requirements for
 an administrative hearing (HAR § 17-2-8 (1995)), powers of the
 hearing officer in conducted hearings (HAR § 17-2-12 (1995)), and
 rights of the parties at a hearing (HAR § 17-2-16 (1995)). 
Parel's counsel did not raise the issue of the applicability of
 HAR chapter 17-2 at any point during the Hearing.
4 Parel's
 
counsel actively participated at the Hearing. Parel's counsel
 submitted exhibits as evidence, and also questioned APS
 Specialist Kageyama and Parel at the Hearing. In sum, Parel was
 clearly notified that the Hearing would be held in accordance
 with HAR chapter 17-2, and failed to contest the established

 For the first time in her reply brief on appeal, Parel argues that
no administrative rule, including HAR chapter 17-2, "applies to an
administrative hearing concerning an appeal of a departmental finding of'abuse.'" However, this argument is waived. In re Hawaiian Flour Mills,
Inc., 76 Hawai' i 1, 14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994) (recognizing that
arguments raised for the first time in the reply briefs on appeal were deemedwaived); see also Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).

5Although HRS § 342B-32 was amended significantly in 1992, we
reference the 1991 cumulative supplement for purposes of comparing Aluli to
the instant case.  See, 1992 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 240, § 32 at 629-30.  
19procedures outlined in HAR chapter 17-2.   Based on the foregoing,
we are not persuaded by Parel's contention that DHS failed to
adopt and follow established hearing procedures, as required by
HAR § 17-1421-9.1(c)(3). 
Lastly, Parel contends that DHS "had a statutory
obligation [under HRS § 346-47 (2015)] to establish criteria or
standards through administrative rulemaking . . . by which
'caregiver abuse,' especially 'neglect' could be determined."  In
support of this contention, Parel relies significantly on Aluli
v. Lerwin, 73 Haw. 56, 828 P.2d 802 (1992).  In Aluli, the
Department of Health (DOH ) issued an air pollution permit which
authorized construction and operation of geothermal wells.  Id.
at 57, 828 P.2d at 803.  Appellants contended that DOH erred in
issuing the permit where "there were no rules promulgated in
accordance with the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act, Chapter
91, [HRS], governing the issuance of such permits" under HRS §
342B-32 (Supp. 1991).5  Id.  At the time Aluli was decided, HRS 
§ 342B-32 provided: 
The director [of health] may require private persons
or agencies or governmental agencies engaged or desiring to
engage in operations which result or may result in air
pollution to secure a permit prior to installation or
operation or continued operation.  The director shall refuse
to issue the permit unless it appears that the operations
would be in compliance with the rules of the department and
the state ambient air quality standards. ...
The supreme court reversed the circuit court's
determination that administrative rules were unnecessary.  Id.
The supreme court concluded that "DOH could not issue a permitNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where the statute only authorizes the issuance of a permit in 
accordance with rules, and the rules had yet to be propagated." Pila
'a 400, 132 Hawai 'i at 265 n.26, 320 P.3d at 930 n.26 (citing 
Aluli, 73 Haw. at 61, 828 P.2d at 805). 
Parel's reliance on Aluli is misplaced. In Aluli, the
 
supreme court based its decision on the provision of HRS § 342B­32, which required DOH to "refuse to issue the permit unless it
 . . . would be in compliance with the rules of the department and
 the state ambient air quality standards." Id. at 58, 808 P.2d at
 
803. HRS § 342B-32 is notably distinguishable from HRS § 346-47,
 
which provides: 
The department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
91 relating to:
(1) The investigation of:
(A)	 Abuse or neglect by a [CNA] working in a health
care setting licensed or certified by the
department; and
. . . . 
(2) 	Action taken against a [CNA] as a result of an
investigation pursuant to paragraph (1). 
Unlike HRS § 342B-32, HRS § 346-47 does not require the 
promulgation of criteria or standards through rulemaking. HRS 
§ 346-47 "contains only a general mandate" that DHS adopt rules related to (1) the investigation of abuse or neglect by a CNA, and (2) action taken against a CNA as a result of an investigation. See, e.g., Pila
'a 400, 132 Hawai 'i at 264-65, 320 
P.3d at 929-30. DHS complied with this general mandate through the promulgation of HAR chapter 17-1421. HAR chapter 17-1421 contains rules regarding the components of an investigation (HAR § 17-1421-9 (2009)), and the disposition and notice of an investigation (HAR § 17-1421-9.1). Furthermore, 
20
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
21[t]here are no principles of construction which prevent the
utilization by the courts of subsequent enactments or
amendments as an aid in arriving at the correct meaning of a
prior statute, and it is very common for a court, in
construing a statute, to refer to subsequent legislation as
impliedly confirming the view which the court has decided to
adopt. 
Gomes v. Campbell, 37 Haw. 252, 257 (Haw. Terr. 1945) (quoting 50
Am. Jur. Statutes, § 337).  
We also note that, in 2016, the Legislature repealed
HRS § 346-47.  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 21, § 5 at 26.  The House
Committee on the Judiciary recommended the repeal of HRS § 346-47
because it was "duplicative of the authority granted to the
Department [of Human Services] by other existing statutory
provisions."  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1459-16, 28th Leg.,
(2016), available at
http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2016/CommReports/SB2874_HSCR
1459-16_.htm.  This action lends further support to the
conclusion that DHS was not required to establish particularized
criteria and standards. 
C.Due Process
Parel asserts that she has a "constitutionally
protected due process right to have the Hearing Officer adhere to
the existing rules."  In particular, she contends that she was
"entitled to have the charges of abuse and patient neglect heard
by a competent, unbiased and objective adjudicator."  Parel
asserts that the Hearing Officer "simply concluded if the patient
fell, then [Parel] was at fault."  Parel submits that the Hearing
Officer's conclusion was "highly speculative" and unsupported by
evidence.NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Hawai 'i Constitution provides, inter alia: "No 
person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due 
process of law. . . ." Haw. Const. art. I, § 5. The basic principles of procedural due process require "notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 136 
Hawai
'i 376, 389, 363 P.3d 224, 237 (2015) (citing Sandy Beach 
Def. Fund v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 70 Haw. 361, 378, 773 P.2d 250, 261 (1989)). 
In Mauna Kea, the Board of Land and Natural Resources 
(BLNR) approved a permit for a proposed astronomy observatory, 
ancillary facilities, and access roads on the upper slopes of 
Mauna Kea. Id. at 381, 383, 363 P.3d at 229, 231. The issue on 
appeal was "whether the approval of the permit before the contested case hearing was held violated the Hawai
'i 
Constitution's guarantee of due process[.]" Id. at 380, 363 P.3d 
at 228. The supreme court stated: "In an adjudicatory proceeding before an administrative agency, due process of law generally prohibits decisionmakers from being biased, and more specifically, prohibits decisionmakers from prejudging matters and the appearance of having prejudged matters." Id. at 389, 363 
P.3d at 237. Additionally, "if there exists any reasonable doubt about the adjudicator's impartiality at the outset of a case, provision of the most elaborate procedural safeguards will not avail to create [an] appearance of justice." Id. at 390, 363 
P.3d at 238 (brackets in original) (quoting Sussel v. City & Cty. of Honolulu Civil Serv. Comm'n, 71 Haw. 101, 108, 784 P.2d 867, 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
870 (1989)). The supreme court held that the "procedural
 
protections that were afforded during the contested case process
 simply cannot remedy the fact that the decisionmaker appeared to
 have already decided and prejudged the matter at the outset." 
Id. at 391, 363 P.3d at 239. Accordingly, the supreme court
 concluded that BLNR's decision to approve the permit prior to the
 contested case hearing denied appellants the "most basic element
 of procedural due process-an opportunity to be heard at a
 meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Id. 
In this case, at the outset of the Hearing, the
 
Hearing Officer informed Parel that he was not involved in DHS's
 investigation, and that his decision would be based on the
 evidence presented. Parel fails to cite any evidence that the
 Hearing Officer was biased, or had made any preliminary
 determinations. Moreover, Parel was provided with notice of the
 hearing, and had a meaningful opportunity to be heard. On
 October 22, 2012, DHS sent a Hearing Notice to inform Parel that
 her hearing was scheduled for November 8, 2012. The Hearing
 Notice also provided that the "hearing will be held on an
 informal basis in accordance with Chapter 91 of the [HRS] and
 Chapters 17-2 and 17-1402 of the [HAR]." At the Hearing, Parel's
 counsel entered exhibits as evidence, cross-examined witnesses
 under oath, and presented arguments in favor of Parel's position. 
Following the Hearing, the Hearing Officer issued his Hearing
 Decision after "carefully review[ing] all evidence,
 administrative rules and policy clarifications[.]" The Hearing
 Decision informed Parel of her ability to "file a notice of
 
23
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
24appeal in circuit court within thirty (30) days after service of
the certified copy of the decision."   As Parel had notice and
meaningful opportunity to be heard, we cannot conclude that her
due process rights were violated. 
D.The Hearing Officer's Findings
Finally, Parel contends that the Hearing Decision was
"clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence on the whole record[.]"  Parel asserts that
the Hearing Officer "simplistically determined that [Client]
would not have fallen if [Parel] had been standing in front of
her and the fact that [Client] fell meant that [Parel] had not
been standing in front of [Client]."
"An agency's findings, if supported by reliable,
probative and substantial evidence, will be upheld."  In re
Hawaii Elec. Light Co., 60 Haw. 625, 630, 594 P.2d 612, 617
(1979) (citing HRS § 91-14(g) (1976)).  Furthermore, 
[i]t is well established that courts decline to consider the
weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in
favor of the administrative findings, or to review the
agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of
witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings
of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field. 
Moi v. Dep't of Safety, 118 Hawai #i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 756
(App. 2008) (quoting Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai# i 263, 268, 47
P.3d 730, 735 (2002)). 
Parel argues that the Hearing Officer ignored her
"statement and testimony at the hearing that she was directly in
front of the patient and turned to get the gait belt."  On the
contrary, it appears from the Hearing Decision that the Hearing
Officer considered Parel's testimony.  At the hearing, Parel  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testified that she "saw [Client] standing -- like I saw in the 
side of my eye she was standing, and then when I turned around she was just like . . . [h]aving a seizure[.]" In the Hearing Decision, the Hearing Officer referenced Parel's testimony that she saw "Client standing 'from the side of my eye'" and that 
"'she turned around' and saw Client having a seizure." Based on 
Parel's testimony, the Hearing Officer determined that Parel was not "standing directly in front of Client as procedure dictated but to the side" and accordingly, that Parel "did not follow proper procedure in effecting Client's transfer which resulted in [Parel] being unable to prevent Client's fall." This court will decline to re-weigh the evidence or disturb the agency's credibility determinations. Moi, 118 Hawai
'i at 242, 188 P.3d at 
756. Rather, "we generally defer to the agency's expertise and 
experience rather than 'substitut[ing our] own judgment for that of the agency.'" Valdez, 2014 WL 7190243 at *4 (brackets in 
original) (quoting Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai
'i 402, 406, 
38 P.3d 570, 574 (2001)). Viewing the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, with the Hearing Officer determining credibility and the weight of the evidence, we cannot conclude that the Hearing Officer's decision was clearly erroneous.
