NO. CAAP-13-0005596
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CONTINENTAL PACIFIC, LLC, by their Managing Agent,
ELITE PACIFIC PROPERTIES, LLC, LEX SMITH and
CYNTHIA M. NOJIMA, Plaintiffs-Appellees,
v.
 
GLEN D. MAGHANOY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(DC CIVIL NO. 1RC12-1-9923)

 
ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon consideration of "Appellees' Second Motion to
 
Dismiss Appeal Based Upon the Mootness Doctrine," filed on May
 
13, 2014, by Plaintiffs-Appellees Continental Pacific, LLC, by
 their Managing Agent Elite Pacific Properties, LLC; Lex Smith;
 and Cynthia M. Nojima (Appellees), the attachments thereto,
 
Defendant-Appellant Glen D. Maghanoy's (Appellant's) May 16, 2014
 
opposition, and the files and record herein, it appears that
 
Appellant's appeal from the District Court of the First Circuit's
 (district court's) October 25, 2013 order denying his "Motion to
 
Dismiss Defendant's Eviction on Grounds of Retaliatory Eviction
 
and Unclean Hands"; November 7, 2013 Judgment for Possession; and
 November 20, 2013 order denying "Defendant(s)' Motion to set
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
aside verdict &/or stay writ of possession" is moot given that 
Appellant has vacated the property and the lease was terminated, and no exception to the mootness doctrine applies. See Wong v. 
Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawai
'i, 62 Haw. 391, 394-95, 616 P.2d 
201, 204 (1980); Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Haw. 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). 
In addition, it appears that this court lacks
 
jurisdiction over Appellant's appeal from the following district
 court orders, from which he purports to appeal in his May 13,
 2014 Second Amended Notice of Appeal: 
(1) December 9, 2013 "Order Denying Defendant's
 
Supplemental Motion to Disqualify Judge Ganges [sic], Filed
 November 22, 2013"; 
(2) January 13, 2014 oral denial of Appellant's motion
 
to disqualify District Court Judge Paul B.K. Wong; 
(3) January 15, 2014 Order Dismissing Plaintiffs'
 
Remaining Claims;
 
(4) February 12, 2014 Garnishee Order; and 
(5) March 11, 2014 Garnishee Order. 
The Second Amended Notice of Appeal is untimely. See 
Enos v. Pacific Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai
'i 345, 355­
56, 910 P.2d 116, 126-27 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ("[A]n amended notice of appeal relates back to the notice of appeal it purports to amend" and "does not appeal an order . . . entered subsequent to the notice of appeal it purports to amend"); Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
4(a)(1). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is granted. The
 
appeal from the October 25, 2013 order denying Appellant's
 "Motion to Dismiss Defendant's Eviction on Grounds of Retaliatory
 Eviction and Unclean Hands"; November 7, 2013 Judgment for
 Possession; and November 20, 2013 order denying "Defendant(s)'
 Motion to set aside verdict &/or stay writ of possession" is
 dismissed as moot.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal from the 
December 9, 2013 "Order Denying Defendant's Supplemental Motion
 
to Disqualify Judge Ganges [sic], Filed November 22, 2013";

 District Court Judge Paul B.K. Wong; January 15, 2014 Order
 Dismissing Plaintiffs' Remaining Claims; February 12, 2014
 Garnishee Order; and March 11, 2014 Garnishee Order is dismissed
 for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any pending motions are
 
dismissed as moot.
