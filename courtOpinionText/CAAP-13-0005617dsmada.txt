IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ROGER WILLIAM NELSON, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
ISOLDE U. NELSON, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 12-1-0531)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Roger William
 
Nelson's (Appellant Roger Nelson) appeal from the following three
 interlocutory orders in a family court divorce proceeding:
 
(1)	 the Honorable Linda S. Martell's November 9, 2017
"Stipulated Order in Lieu of Trial" addressing child
custody, child support, and the division of property;
 
(2)	 the Honorable Kevin A. Souza's November 15, 2013
"Order Denying 'Plaintiff's Motion for Relief from (1)
Child Support Order Filed 11/19/2012; (2) Income
Withholding Order Filed 11/29/2012' Filed 9/23/2013";
and
 
(3)	 the Honorable Kevin A. Souza's November 15, 2013
"Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Pre-Decree
Relief Filed 2/25/2013[.]"
 
None of these three interlocutory orders qualifies as an
 
independently appealable final order or decree pursuant to Hawaii
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006), which provides that "[a]n
 
interested party aggrieved by any order or decree of the court
 may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for review of
 questions of law and fact upon the same terms and conditions as
 in other cases in the
 circuit court [.]" (Emphasis added). In
 
circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may appeal from "final
 judgments, orders or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 2013). Therefore, this case is appealable only if the family
 court enters a final judgment, order or decree, and, furthermore,
 that final judgment, order or decree must, at a minimum, dissolve
 the marriage of Appellant Roger Nelson and Defendant-Appellee
 Isolde U. Nelson (Appellee Isolde Nelson):
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
 (4) division and distribution of property and debts. 
Black
 
v. Black, 6 Haw. App. [493], 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In
 Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided. Although we recommend that,
except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we
conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is
final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3),
and (4) remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.
 
Eaton v. Eaton , 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987)
 
(footnote omitted). None of the three appealed interlocutory
 
order is independently appealable under HRS § 571-54 and the
 holding in Eaton because the family court has not yet dissolved
 the marriage between Appellant Roger Nelson and Appellee Isolde
 Nelson.

Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the 
Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), none of the three appealed interlocutory orders satisfies the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent an appealable final judgment, order or decree,
 
we lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal, and Appellant
 Roger Nelson's appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0005617 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
