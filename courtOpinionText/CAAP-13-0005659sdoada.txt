IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CAROL S. POZY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DCW-13-0001811)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Carol S. Pozy appeals from two
 
Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on October 29,
 
2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division.
1/ After a bench trial, the District Court found Pozy
 
guilty of Count 1: Criminal Littering, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 708-829; and Count 2: Attempted
 Cruelty to Animals in the Second, in violation of HRS §§ 711­1109(1)(a)
2/ and 705-500, and sentenced her to six months of
 
probation on Count 2, among other things. 
On appeal, Pozy argues that the District Court erred in 
convicting her of Attempted Cruelty to Animals in the Second Degree after erroneously taking judicial notice that chocolate is toxic to dogs. Even if the court had not so erred, Pozy asserts, the Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i's evidence was 
1/
 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided.
 
2/
 The statute provides in relevant part that "[a] person commits the
offense of cruelty to animals in the second degree if the person
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly . . . causes substantial bodily injury
to . . . any animal[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1109(1)(a) (Supp. 2013).

insufficient to support her conviction because the State failed
 
to show that she possessed the requisite intent to feed the dogs
 an amount and type of chocolate that would substantially harm
 them. 
The State concedes that the District Court erred in 
taking judicial notice of the effect of chocolate on dogs and asks this court to remand the case for execution of the sentence imposed on Pozy's Criminal Littering conviction. The State's concession notwithstanding, "appellate courts have an independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to determine that such error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'" State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai
'i 219, 221–22, 74 
P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (quoting State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i 333, 
336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)). In other words, the State's concession of error "is not binding upon an appellate court[.]" Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502 (quoting Territory v. 
Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise as well as
 the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Pozy's appeal as
 follows, and reverse her conviction on Count 2 while affirming
 her conviction on Count 1:
 
Over defense objection, the District Court took
 
"judicial notice of the toxicity of chocolate to dogs." The
 State now concedes, and we agree, that the District Court erred
 in taking judicial notice under the circumstances.
 
A judicially noticed fact "must be one not subject to 
reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Haw. R. Evid. 201(b). In other words, "the trial court may take judicial notice of a fact if it is common knowledge or easily verifiable." Williams v. Aona, 121 Hawai
'i 1, 11 n.6, 210 P.3d 501, 511 n.6

(2009) (quoting State v. Lord, 63 Haw. 270, 272, 625 P.2d 1038,
 
1039 (1981)) (taking judicial notice of portions of the
 collective bargaining agreement at issue on appeal, which were
 attached to the opening brief). "[A] judge cannot take judicial
 notice of facts based solely upon his [or her ]own personal
 knowledge unless the facts are also known to the community
 generally." Haw. R. Evid. 201(b) cmt. (citing Pua v. Hilo
 Tribune Herald, Ltd., 31 Haw. 65 (Haw. Terr. 1929)). 
The State notes that "[w]hile ingestion of chocolate
 
may poison a dog, a toxic dose depends upon the size of the dog,
 the amount of chocolate a dog ingests, and what type of chocolate
 the dog ingests." (Emphasis omitted.) Furthermore, here there
 was no evidence adduced as to the type and size of the dogs in
 question, the amount or type of chocolate left for them, or
 whether the chocolate left was sufficient to cause any injury. 
"[T]he purpose of the judicial notice rule . . . is to
 
eliminate the necessity of taking the time of the court and jury
 to make formal proof of a fact which cannot be disputed[.]" State
 v. Moses, 102 Hawai
'i 449, 454, 77 P.3d 940, 945 (2003) (quoting 
In re Estate of Herbert, 90 Hawai 'i 443, 466, 979 P.2d 39, 62 
(1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the blanket generalization that chocolate is toxic to dogs, without any context, is subject to dispute. Therefore, the District Court erred in taking judicial notice that chocolate was toxic to dogs because that fact—at least without regard to the amount and type of chocolate and the size and type of the dogs in question—is not common knowledge or easily verifiable. See Choy v. Otaguro, 32 
Haw. 543, 548–49 (Haw. Terr. 1932) (holding that the trial court could not take judicial notice that it was highly improbable that persons in Honolulu owned stock in a company incorporated in Connecticut), overruled on other grounds in part by Gilliam v.  
Gerhardt, 34 Haw. 466, 471–72 (Haw. Terr. 1938). Without the judicially-noticed fact, there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. See State v. Richie , 88 Hawai
'i 19, 33, 
960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998).  
In light of the foregoing, we need not address Pozy's

 
other arguments.
