IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DEXTER J. SMITH, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-1834)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Dexter J. Smith (Smith) appeals
 
from the October 28, 2013 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 Court).
1 Smith was convicted of Kidnapping as a class A felony
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 707-720(1)(d)
 and/or (1)(e) (2014).
 
On appeal, Smith argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
2
because it conducted defective Tachibana  colloquies with Smith
and those defective colloquies were not harmless beyond a

 
reasonable doubt.
 
After a careful review of the point raised and the

 
arguments made by the parties, the record on appeal, and the
 applicable legal authority, we resolve Smith's point as follows
 and affirm.
 
Smith faults the Circuit Court's two pre-trial
 
advisements for being only "a lecture" and "a reminder"

respectively, and not a colloquy. However, Smith cites no 
authority, and we find none, for the proposition that a colloquy is required for the pre-trial advisement. See State v. Lewis, 94 
Hawai
'i 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000) ("trial courts prior 
to the start of trial, shall (1) inform the defendant of his or her personal right to testify or not to testify and (2) alert the defendant that, if he or she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court will briefly question him or her to ensure that the decision not to testify is the defendant's own decision." (emphasis added, citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted)). 
As to the end-of-trial colloquy, Defense counsel did
 
not object to and nothing in the record indicates that Smith did
 not understand his rights. While not a model of pedagogy, the
 Circuit Court conducted an adequate colloquy with Smith and
 obtained a knowing waiver of his right to testify. Although the
 Circuit Court did not individually and separately address each of
 the five rights, the Circuit Court logically divided the five
 rights into two groups: (1) what rights and repercussions would
 be triggered if Smith chose to testify; and (2) what rights and
 repercussions flowed if Smith chose not to testify. The Circuit
 Court explained how those groups of rights operate together and
 confirmed Smith's understanding after each explanation. The
 Circuit Court then asked Smith whether he wanted to testify or
 not and Smith responded that he did not. On this record, we
 conclude that Smith understood his rights when he made his
 decision not to testify.
 
Therefore the October 28, 2013 Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
