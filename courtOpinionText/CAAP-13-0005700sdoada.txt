IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MATHEW LAWSON, Appellant-Appellant, v.
ATTORNEY GENERAL, Appellee-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-1331)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal, Appellant-Appellant pro se
 
Mathew Lawson (Lawson) appeals from the following orders from the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 (circuit court):
 
(1) "Notice of Entry of Final Judgment," filed October
 
17, 2013;
 
(2) "Final Judgment," filed October 17, 2013;
 
(3) "Order Dismissing Notice of Appeal to Circuit
 
Court, Filed May 6, 2013," filed October 17, 2013.
 
On appeal, Lawson contends the circuit court erred in
 
(1) dismissing his agency appeal for lack of jurisdiction and (2)
 finding that, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 846E­
2(b) (2014 Repl.),
2
 he was required to register as a covered

offender in the State of Hawai 'i (Hawai 'i) before he could 
petition Appellee-Appellee the Attorney General for termination
 
of his registration requirements.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Lawson's
 appeal is without merit.
 
To determine whether a circuit court can exercise
 
jurisdiction over an appeal brought pursuant to HRS § 91-14,
 
2(...continued)
in this State and who has not been designated as a covered
offender by a court of this State but who has been
designated as a covered offender, sex offender, offender
against minors, repeat covered offender, sexually violent
predator, or any other sexual offender designation in
another state or jurisdiction and was, as a result of such
designation, subjected to registration or community or
public notification, or both, or would be if the person was
a resident of that state or jurisdiction, without regard to
whether the person otherwise meets the criteria for
registration as a covered offender, shall register in the
manner provided in this section and shall be subject to
community and public notification as provided in section
846E-3. A person who meets the criteria of this subsection
is subject to the requirements and penalty provisions of
section 846E-9 until the person successfully petitions the
attorney general for termination of registration
requirements by:
 
(1)	 Providing an order issued by the court that
designated the person as a covered offender, sex
offender, offender against minors, repeat
covered offender, sexually violent predator, or
any other sexual offender designation in the
state or jurisdiction in which the order was
issued, which states that such designation has
been removed or demonstrates to the attorney
general that such designation, if not imposed by
a court, has been removed by operation of law or
court order in the state or jurisdiction in
which the designation was made, and such person
does not meet the criteria for registration as a
covered offender under the laws of this State;
 or
 
(2)	 Demonstrating that the out-of-state convictions
upon which the sexual offender designation was
established are not covered offenses under
 section 846E-1, thereby showing that such person
does not meet the criteria for registration as a
covered offender under the laws of this State.
 
If the covered offender is not satisfied with the decision
 of the attorney general on the request for termination of
registration requirements, the covered offender may appeal
the decision pursuant to chapter 91.

we consider whether the following requirements have been
met:
 
first, the proceeding that resulted in the
unfavorable agency action
 must have been a
contested case hearing--i.e., a hearing that was
(1) required by law and (2) determined the
rights, duties, and privileges of specific
parties; second, the agency's action must
represent a final decision or order, or a
preliminary ruling such that deferral of review
would deprive the claimant of adequate relief;
third, the claimant must have followed the
applicable agency rules and, therefore, have
been involved in the contested case; and
finally, the claimant's legal interests must
have been injured--i.e., the claimant must have
standing to appeal.

 Venture, 77 Hawai
'i 64, 67, 881 P.2d 1210, 1213 (1994)). Here, 
Lawson contends that his correspondence with the Hawai 'i Criminal 
Justice Data Center (Data Center), constituted a contested case
 
hearing so that the circuit court had jurisdiction over his
 
appeal. We disagree. 
"A contested case is an agency hearing that 1) is
 
required by law and 2) determines the rights, duties, and
 privileges of specific parties." 
PASH, 79 Hawai 'i at 431, 903 
P.2d at 1252. "In order for a hearing to be 'required by law,'
 it may be required by statute, agency rule, or constitutional due
 process." Id. Furthermore, in Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76
 
Hawai
'i 128, 134, 870 P.2d 1272, 1278 (1994), the Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court held:
 
If the statute or rule governing the activity in question
does not mandate a hearing prior to the administrative
agency's decision-making, the actions of the administrative
agency are not "required by law" and do not amount to a
"final decision or order in a contested case" from which a
 direct appeal to circuit court is possible.

HRS § 846E-2(b) provides that a person who maintains a 
residence in Hawai 'i and who has been designated as a covered 
offender, sex offender, offender against minors, repeat covered 
offender, sexually violent predator, or any other sexual offender designation in any other state or jurisdiction (out-of-state 
offender) shall register with the Attorney General, and shall be 
subject to community and public notification, pursuant to 
HRS § 846E-3 (2014 Repl.). 
HRS § 846E-2(b) specifically indicates that an out-of­
state offender is required to register "without regard to whether the person otherwise meets the criteria for registration as a covered offender[.]" The statute provides that an out-of-state offender who believes that his conviction does not meet the definition of "covered offenses" can petition the Attorney General to terminate registration requirements. Thus, the Attorney General was not required to entertain Lawson's claims that he was not a covered offender until he first registered in Hawai
'i. See HRS § 846E-2(b); see also State v. Guidry, 105 
Hawai'i 222, 234, 96 P.3d 242, 254 (2004) ("Because due process 
does not require that a hearing be held at any specific time, due process is satisfied so long as an offender is afforded a hearing at some time.") Lawson had not registered with the Attorney General when he submitted his letter requesting termination of his registration requirements, therefore, the Data Center's responses to Lawson's request were not required by law. 
Furthermore, Lawson's correspondence with the Data 
Center did not determine his rights, duties, or privileges. See 
PASH, 79 Hawai
'i at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252. The Data Center's 
responses were merely recitations of what registration procedures would apply, if Lawson were to visit Hawai
'i. In fact, the Data 
Center's April 10, 2013 response explicitly stated that Lawson was first required to register in Hawai
'i before it could make a 
determination as to whether Lawson was a "covered offender." Because Lawson's correspondence with the Data Center was not required by law and did not determine his rights, duties, or privileges, Lawson's correspondence with the Data Center did not constitute an appealable contested case hearing.

Inasmuch as we hold that the circuit court's dismissal
 
of Lawson's appeal was not erroneous, we need not address
 
Lawson's remaining points on appeal.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following orders from the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit are affirmed:
 
(1) "Notice of Entry of Final Judgment," filed October
 
17, 2013;
