STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
Q. BRITT CORMIER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC13-1-001530)
 
ORDER
 
GRANTING JANUARY 28, 2014 MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE APPELLATE
COURT CASE NUMBERS CAAP-13-0004623 AND CAAP-13-0005575
 
AND
 
DISMISS APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-13-0005718
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations’ (Appellee State 
DLIR) January 28, 2014 motion to consolidate appellate court case numbers CAAP-13-0004623 AND CAAP-13-0005575 and dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005718, (2) the lack of any timely memorandum by Defendant-Appellant Q. Britt Cormier (Appellant Cormier) in opposition to Appellee State DLIR’s January 28, 2014 motion in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005718, and (3) the record, it appears that the proposed consolidation of
 appellate court case numbers CAAP-13-0004623 and CAAP-13-0005575
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is warranted and, more significantly in appellate court case 
number CAAP-13-0005718, we lack appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Cormier’s appeal in appellate court case number CAAP­13-0005718 from the Honorable Paul B.K. Wong’s October 25, 2013 judgment, because Appellant Cormier’s November 26, 2013 notice of appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005718 is untimely as to the October 25, 2013 judgment under Rule 4 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
“When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of
 
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment
 or appealable order.” HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). Appellant Cormier
 filed timely notices of appeal in appellate court case numbers
 CAAP-13-0004623 and CAAP-13-0005575, which this court is
 consolidating under appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005575
 through separate court orders in appellate court case numbers
 CAAP-13-0004623 and CAAP-13-0005575. In contrast, however,
 Appellant Cormier did not file her November 26, 2013 notice of
 appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005718 within
 thirty days after entry of the October 25, 2013 judgment, as HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(1) requires. The failure to file a timely notice of
 appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
 parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
 the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o
 court or judge or justice is authorized to change the
 jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these
 rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any 
failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Cormier’s untimely appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005718. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee State DLIR’s
 
January 28, 2014 motion to consolidate appellate court case
 numbers CAAP-13-0004623 AND CAAP-13-0005575 and dismiss appellate
 court case number CAAP-13-0005718 is granted, and appellate court
 case number CAAP-13-0005718 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
