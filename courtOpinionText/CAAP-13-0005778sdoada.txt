APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-1004)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Anthony Richardson (Richardson)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on
 
October 30, 2013 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (circuit court).
1 A jury convicted Richardson of one count of
 
Burglary in the First Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 708-810(1)(c) (2014).
2 The charge stemmed from
 
an incident in which Richardson entered a house through an open

 HRS § 708-810 provides in pertinent part:
 
§708-810 Burglary in the first degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of burglary in the first degree if the
person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a
building, with intent to commit therein a crime against a
person or against property rights, and:
. . . .
 (c) The person recklessly disregards a risk that the
building is the dwelling of another, and the building
is such a dwelling.

(3) Burglary in the first degree is a class B felony.

window and disabled the alarm system while the residents of the
 
house were away on vacation.
 
The circuit court denied Richardson's motions for
 
judgment of acquittal and sentenced him to ten years of
 imprisonment. 
On appeal, Richardson argues that the circuit court 
erred by: (1) denying his motions for judgment of acquittal based upon HRS § 708-812.5 (2014) because the statute is unconstitutionally vague when read in conjunction with the burglary statute; and (2) denying his motions for judgment of acquittal by finding that State v. Hanohano, No. 30246, 2010 WL 5146282, 130 Hawai
'i 346, 310 P.3d 1047 (App. Dec. 20, 2010) 
(mem.) did not apply to the instant case. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 Richardson's points of error as follows and affirm.
(1) Richardson argues that HRS § 708-812.5, which the 
legislature enacted in 2006 as part of a comprehensive revision of the Hawai
'i Penal Code, should be invalidated. The statute 
reads: "A person engages in conduct 'with intent to commit therein a crime against a person or against property rights' if the person formed the intent to commit within the building a crime against a person or property rights before, during, or after unlawful entry into the building." (Emphasis added.) 
Claims that a criminal statute is unconstitutionally
 
vague are subject to the following standard: 
Due process of law requires that a penal statute state with
reasonable clarity the act it proscribes and provide fixed
standards for adjudging guilt, or the statute is void for
vagueness. Statutes must give the person of ordinary
intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct
is prohibited so that he or she may choose between lawful
and unlawful conduct.
 
State v. Kapela, 82 Hawai 'i 381, 392, 922 P.2d 994, 1005 (App. 
1996) (citation and block quote format omitted). In our view, 
HRS § 708-812.5, in conjunction with HRS § 708-810(1)(c), 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
provides reasonable clarity as to what is proscribed and is not
 
vague.
 
Despite Richardson's contention that HRS § 708-812.5 is
 
inconsistent with the Model Penal Code (MPC) and general
 principles of penal liability, he cites no case law in support of
 the proposition that failure to adhere to the MPC's burglary
 provisions somehow invalidates a criminal statute. Indeed, the
 State cites to several cases from outside jurisdictions which
 demonstrate that other states have similarly adopted burglary
 statutes departing from the MPC and providing that the formation
 of intent does not have to be concurrent with the unlawful
 entrance. See Gratton v. State, 456 So.2d 865, 872 (Ala. Crim.
 
App. 1984) (holding that adoption of a new criminal code changed
 the definition of burglary so that "the intent to commit a crime
 may be concurrent with the unlawful entry or it may be formed
 after the entry and while the accused remains unlawfully");
 People v. Larkins, 109 P.3d 1003, 1004-05 (Colo. App. 2004)
 (concluding that the defendant's reliance on earlier case law was
 misplaced because the burglary statute had been amended to remove
 "the requirement that intent to commit a crime exist at the time
 of entry"). 
In sum, Richardson fails to establish the statute's 
unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.
3 See State v. 
Bates, 84 Hawai 'i 211, 220, 933 P.2d 48, 57 (1997) ("Mere 
difficulty in ascertaining [a statute's] meaning, or the fact that it is susceptible to interpretation will not render it nugatory[.]" (citations and block quote format omitted)).
(2) We reject Richardson's argument that the circuit
 
court was required to follow State v. Hanohano, an unpublished
 
4
memorandum opinion,  and State v. Mahoe, 89 Hawai 'i 284, 972 P.2d 
3
 Although Richardson mentions that the statute is also overbroad in
his Points of Error, he does not present any argument on this issue.
Therefore, pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule
28(b)(7), this argument is waived.

 Pursuant to HRAP Rule 35(c)(2), an unpublished memorandum opinion
issued on or after July 1, 2008 is not precedent, but may be cited for
persuasive value.

287 (1998), by extension, for the proposition that intent must be
 
established at the time the unlawful entry was made. 
First, Mahoe was decided before HRS § 780-812.5 was
 
enacted. Because Richardson was charged for an offense committed
 in July 2011, his reliance on Mahoe is misplaced. Second, in
 Hanohano, the court based its decision on the "remains
 unlawfully" portion of the burglary statute because the
 defendant's entrance into his mother's home was otherwise lawful. 
Hanohano, 2010 WL 5146282, at *5. Thus, Hanohano did not need to
 address HRS § 708-812.5. Pursuant to the language of HRS § 708­812.5, it applies to situations of "unlawful entry into a
 building," not where a person remains unlawfully. Therefore,
 Hanohano is inapposite.
 
In sum, we reject Richardson's arguments that the
 
circuit court relied on the wrong law in denying his motions for
 acquittal. The fact that the residents of the home never gave
 Richardson permission to enter the home, together with the
 evidence that Richardson entered through an open window, disabled
 the alarm system by ripping wires out of the wall, opened dresser
 drawers in several bedrooms, and consumed juice from the
 refrigerator supported the jury's conclusion that, at a minimum,
 Richardson intended to commit a crime while in the house.
 
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence filed on October 30, 2013 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is hereby affirmed.
