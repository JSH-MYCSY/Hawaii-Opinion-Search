OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MICHAEL L.K. WEEKS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
PUNA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-12-026655)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Michael L. K. Weeks (Weeks) appeals 
from a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order entered 
October 25, 2013, in the District Court of the Third Circuit, Puna Division (district court).
1 Judgment was entered against 
Weeks on Count I, Driving Motor Vehicle Without a Valid License in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 286-102(b) (Supp. 2014), and Count II, No Motor Vehicle Insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005). The district court entered Judgment after denying Weeks's motion to dismiss, in which Weeks argued that the State of Hawai
'i (State) lacked jurisdiction over him 
and he asserted the affirmative defense of ignorance or mistake of law. 
On appeal, Weeks asserts that the district court erred
 
as a matter of law in denying his motion to dismiss. He
 primarily relies on the affirmative defense of ignorance or

mistake of law under HRS § 702-220(1) (2014). He also argues the
 
State lacks jurisdiction over him.2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Weeks's
 point of error as follows and affirm.
 
HRS § 702-220(1) provides that 
§702-220. Ignorance or mistake of law; belief that
conduct not legally prohibited. In any prosecution, it shall
be an affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the
conduct or caused the result alleged under the belief that
the conduct or result was not legally prohibited when the
defendant acts in reasonable reliance upon an official
statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or
erroneous, contained in:
 
(1) A statute or other enactment;
. . . .
 
Weeks asserts that he believed he was not required to 
renew his driver's license when it expired in 1996 due to Pub. L. 
No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510 (2012) (Apology Resolution) and 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 359, at 1009-13 (Act 359). Weeks contends that these provisions lead him to believe he did not need a Hawai
'i State licence because he has a Hawaiian Kingdom driver's 
license. Weeks further asserts that he is not subject to the jurisdiction of the State or the United States. 
With regard to Weeks's claim of ignorance or mistake of
 
law under HRS § 702-220, he does not contend -- as he must to
 rely on HRS § 702-220 -- that after his reliance on the Apology
 Resolution and Act 359, they were "afterward determined to be
 invalid or erroneous[.]" HRS § 702-220. To the contrary, Weeks
 asserts the validity of the Apology Resolution and Act 359 as
 laws "telling you you're obligated to facilitate my efforts to be
 governed by an indigenous sovereign nation of my choosing."

 Weeks's opening brief does not comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 in numerous ways. However, because we seek to
address cases on the merits where possible, we address Weeks's arguments tothe extent they are discernable. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995).

Weeks does not meet the requirements for the defense under HRS
 
§ 702-220.
 
Further, Weeks's assertion that he is not subject to
the laws of the State of Hawai 'i is foreclosed by State v. 
Kaulia, 128 Hawai 'i 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013) and State v. 
Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i 43, 101 P.3d 652 (App. 2004). In 
Kaulia, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court ruled that:  
[Defendant] appears to argue that he is immune from
the court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the
Kingdom government. In that regard, we reaffirm thatwhatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of itsorigins, the State of Hawai' i ... is now, a lawful 
government. Individuals claiming to be citizens of theKingdom and not of the State are not exempt from applicationof the State's laws. 
128 Hawai 'i at 487, 291 P.3d at 385 (citations, quotation marks, 
and brackets omitted). Additionally, in Fergerstrom, this court 
held that "[p]ersons claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i and not the State of Hawai 'i are not exempt from the laws 
of the State of Hawai 'i applicable to all persons (citizens and 
non-citizens) operating motor vehicles on public roads and highways within the State of Hawai
'i." 106 Hawai 'i at 55, 101 
P.3d at 664. The district court thus had jurisdiction over Weeks's case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order entered October 25, 2013, in the
 District Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
