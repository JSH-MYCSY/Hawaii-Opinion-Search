STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MI YOUNG YOU, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
  
(CASE NO. 1DCW-13-000332)
 
ORDER DISMISSING AS MOOT THE
  
APRIL 3, 2014 "STIPULATION TO DISMISS APPEAL"
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the "Stipulation to Dismiss 
Appeal" (Stipulation) filed on April 3, 2014 by Defendant-
Appellant Mi Young You, and the records and files herein, it appears that the Stipulation as to this criminal appeal is not supported by Appellant's affidavit or declaration that reflects a knowing and intelligent understanding of the consequences of the dismissal of the appeal and that the withdrawal is made voluntarily, as required under Rule 42(c) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure. However, it also appears that, on remand, the district court approved a stipulation that vacated the   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
judgment of conviction that is the subject of the instant
 
appeal.1 Where no judgment of conviction remains from which
 
Appellant may properly appeal, the appeal is moot, and we now
 reassume jurisdiction over the appeal to address this matter. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed as
 
moot.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, April 15, 2014.
