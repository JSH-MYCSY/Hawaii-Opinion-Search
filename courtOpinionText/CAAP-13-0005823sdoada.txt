SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
In this foreclosure case, Defendant-Appellant Tom
 
Ernest Sena (Sena) appeals from the Judgment entered on November
 
25, 2013, in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Hawaii Community Federal
 Credit Union (HCFCU) and against "all [d]efendants," including
 Sena. The Judgment was entered by the Circuit Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit (Circuit Court)  pursuant to its order granting HCFCU's
motion for summary judgment, decree of foreclosure, and order of

 
sale.
 
On appeal, Sena argues that the Circuit Court erred in

 
granting HCFCU's motion for summary judgment because there are
 genuine issues of material fact regarding whether: (1) HCFCU's
 note and mortgage are valid; (2) the actions of HCFCU to obtain
 the subject property by foreclosure constituted unfair and
 deceptive trade practices; and (3) HCFCU has an enforceable
 secured interest in the subject property given Sena's claim that
 the note and mortgage are invalid. We affirm.
 
I.
 
HCFCU brought its foreclosure action based on a
 
$150,000 loan it had made to, and a mortgage it had obtained
 from, Defendant Maria Antonieta Larrea (Larrea). The loan was
 made pursuant to a home equity credit line agreement (Note) and
 payment of the loan was secured by a mortgage on the subject
 property (Mortgage) in favor of HCFCU. Sena's interest in the
 subject property is based on a quitclaim deed he received from
 Larrea dated five years after Larrea's execution of the Note and
 Mortgage. Sena's interest in the subject property is junior and
 subordinate to the Mortgage.
 
HCFCU filed its foreclosure complaint after Larrea
 
failed to make payment as required under the Note. Larrea failed
 to answer the complaint and a default was entered against her. 
HCFCU subsequently moved for summary judgement against all
 defendants, decree of foreclosure, and order of sale. In support

of its motion, HCFCU presented evidence that Larrea was in
 
default of her obligations to make payments under the terms of
 the Note and Mortgage and that she failed to cure the default
 after receiving proper notice from HCFCU. The Circuit Court
 granted HCFCU's motion and entered a decree of foreclosure in
 favor of HCFCU.
 
II.
 
We reject Sena's contention that the Circuit Court 
erred in granting HCFCU's motion for summary judgment. Through its motion for summary judgment, HCFCU established that Larrea had defaulted on her obligations under the Note and Mortgage and that HCFCU was entitled to foreclose on the subject property. In opposing HCFCU's motion for summary judgment, Sena did not "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(e) (2000). On 
appeal, Sena fails to provide any persuasive argument in support of his claim that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment. For example, Sena contends that the Note and Mortgage, which were signed by Larrea, are invalid because they were not also signed by HCFCU. However, Sena fails to provide any authority establishing that a note and mortgage must be signed by the lender to be valid. We conclude that Sena's contentions on appeal are without merit and that the Circuit Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of HCFCU. 
III. 
We affirm the Circuit Court's Judgment.
