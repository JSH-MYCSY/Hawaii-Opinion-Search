(subsection (a)).2
 
On appeal, Bowman contends (1) that the written
 
complaint and oral charge were insufficient because they did not
 
put him on notice of the elements of HRS § 291C-131(c) (2007
 
3
Repl.) (subsection (c)),  which applies to vehicles transporting
agricultural produce; (2) that subsection (c) is an offense for which Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) had the initial 
burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) that Bowman cannot be charged for violating subsection (c) because the State did not prove he was the "owner" of the vehicle; and (4) that the State failed to prove all elements of subsection (c) beyond a reasonable doubt.

I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 30, 2013, Bowman, who identifies himself as a 
farmer, was transporting cabbage from his field in Honoka 'a to 
Pa'auilo. Bowman was driving a "green flatbed pickup [truck]" 
(vehicle) with the cabbage in uncovered containers in the back of 
the vehicle. No evidence was introduced at trial as to who owned

 HRS § 291C-131(a) provides: 
§ 291C-131 Spilling loads on highways; penalties . (a) No
vehicle shall be moved on any highway, unless the vehicle is so
constructed, covered, or loaded as to prevent any of its load
other than clear water or feathers from live birds from dropping,
sifting, leaking, blowing, spilling, or otherwise escaping
therefrom, except that sand may be dropped for the purpose of
securing traction, or water or other substance may be sprinkled on
a highway in cleaning or maintaining the highway.

section but the owner of the vehicle must provide for the
reasonable removal of all such produce spilled or dropped on the
highway.

 Bowman's points on appeal in his opening brief fails to comply
with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 29(b)(4). Bowman's 
counsel is warned that future noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28 may result insanctions.

the vehicle.
 
As Bowman drove south on Route 19 to Pa 'auilo, Officer 
Romeo Fuiava (Officer Fuiava) was traveling in the opposite 
direction and passed Bowman on the road. Officer Fuiava observed 
"either cabbage or lettuce" in back of Bowman's vehicle. About a half a mile after Officer Fuiava passed Bowman, he "started seeing the lettuce on the side of the road and some on the road."
5 
Officer Fuiava did not see any produce on the road when
 
he passed the same spot on the road about a half hour to forty-
five minutes before seeing Bowman. Officer Fuiava also did not
 see any other vehicles transporting produce during his shift that
 day.
 
Upon seeing the produce on the road, Officer Fuiava 
turned around to "catch up" to the green flatbed truck that had previously passed. Officer Fuiava "caught up" to the vehicle in Pa
'auilo in the parking lot of "Earl's store." The vehicle in 
the parking lot was the same vehicle that Officer Fuiava had seen on Route 19. Officer Fuiava made contact with the driver of the vehicle, whom he identified as Bowman. Officer Fuiava recalled that he explained to Bowman why Bowman had been stopped, but could not remember what was said during their conversation. Officer Fuiava issued Bowman a citation for violating subsection (a). 
On November 7, 2013, the case proceeded to a bench
 
trial with Bowman appearing pro se. During the bench trial, the
 prosecutor orally arraigned Bowman, stating:
 
On or about the 28th day of August, 2013, in Hamakua, state
and county of Hawaii, Max Bowman was the operator of a motor
vehicle being moved on a highway, which vehicle was not so
constructed, covered, or loaded as to prevent any of its
load from dropping, sifting, leaking, blowing, spilling, or
otherwise escaping therefrom, thereby a violation of Section
291C-101(a) (sic), [HRS] as Amended.
 
Bowman testified on his behalf, expressing a belief that he was
 
5
 The court later confirmed that the spilled produce was cabbage,
not lettuce.
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mischarged under subsection (a) and that he thought subsection
 
(c) was a more applicable charge. Bowman stated:
 
Well, with, you know, respect to our prosecuting
attorney, I just feel like I've been mischarged. It was
 
referred under [subsection (a)], which is where he got the
no vehicle shall be moved on any highway unless the vehicle
is so constructed, dropping, sifting. Anyway, the provision
I feel is more applicable is [subsection (c)]: "Vehicles
carrying agricultural produce from fields during harvesting

shall be exempt from the requirements of this section, but
the owner of the vehicle must provide for a reasonable
removal of all such produce spilled or dropped on the
highway."
 
(Emphasis added.) After the district court suggested that Bowman
 
testify to facts in support of subsection (c), Bowman further
 testified:
 
I'm a farmer. I was carrying agricultural produce from my
field during harvesting, at which point some of it did spill
on the highway. As far as the reasonable removal section
 goes, it couldn't have been much. It was trimmings. I
 
actually drove past that section of the road later in the
day, did not see any of it. I can only imagine the wind
blew it off the road to decompose in a matter of days on the
side, or it had been run over sufficiently and evaporated on
the road. It could not have been more than one pound or two
pounds of cabbage, maybe 20 leaves. And if reasonable
 
removal is any indication, I feel risk of life and limb,
running onto the road, grabbing three or four leaves of
cabbages as opposed to letting it decompose naturally does
not sounds reasonable to me.
 
(Emphases added.) On cross-examination, Bowman testified that he
 
was carrying his load of cabbage for work that day and that he
 returned to the location where he had dropped the cabbage about
 three to four hours after receiving his citation. Bowman did not
 dispute that he spilled cabbage trimmings on the highway that day
 nor did he dispute that he transported his load in uncovered
 containers. Instead, Bowman contended that, pursuant to
 subsection (c), he "reasonabl[y] removed" the trimmings from the
 road when he chose to allow the trimmings to "decompose
 naturally."
 
After hearing the testimony of Officer Fuiava and
 
Bowman, the district court determined that, although subsection
 (c) could have been applied to the facts of the case, Bowman did
 not act reasonably to remove all of the products that were
 spilled or dropped when he "just left it on the road." The
 
4

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
district court reasoned that "had [Bowman] gone and picked it up,
 
[he] would have been acquitted of this charge." The court
 further reasoned that, under subsection (c), Bowman "was pretty
 much [exempt] from having to cover this load, but if it falls,
 [he's] going to have to go and pick it up." The district court
 ultimately determined that the State had proven its case beyond a
 reasonable doubt and found Bowman guilty of violating subsection
 (a). The district court imposed a $250 fine and a $7 driver
 education assessment fee on Bowman.
 
On November 29, 2013, Bowman, represented by counsel,
 
filed a timely notice of appeal.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Statutory Interpretation
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguous
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by
examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.
 
State v. Ribbel, 111 Hawai 'i 426, 431, 142 P.3d 290, 295 (2006) 
(emphases omitted) (quoting Peterson v. Hawaii Elec. Light Co., 
85 Hawai 'i 322, 327–28, 944 P.2d 1265, 1270–71 (1997), superseded 
on other grounds by HRS § 269–15.5 (Supp.1999)). B. Sufficiency of Charge
 
"Whether an indictment or complaint sets forth all the 
essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law, which [the appellate court reviews] under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard." State v. Young, 107 Hawai
'i 36, 39, 109 
P.3d 677, 680 (2005) (citation, internal quotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). See also State v. Walker, 126 
Hawai
'i 475, 485, 273 P.3d 1161, 1171 (2012). 
A criminal charge serves multiple purposes. To
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
initiate the criminal process, a charge must sufficiently
state an offense to establish the court's jurisdiction overa case. State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 142, 63 P.3d
1109, 1112 (2003). The sufficiency of a charge alsoimplicates an accused's rights under the Hawai' i 
Constitution, article I, sections 5, 10, and 14. First,under article I, section 5, "No person shall be deprived oflife, liberty or property without due process of law."Second, under article I, section 14, an accused is entitledto adequate notice of the charges against him or her: "Inall criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the rightto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation." Third, under article I, section 10, an indictment must besufficiently specific to protect a person from being chargedtwice for the same offense: "Nor shall any person be subjectfor the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy." 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i 48, 52, 276 P.3d 617, 621 (2012) 
(brackets and ellipsis omitted).
 
C. Sufficiency of Evidence
 
We have long held that evidence adduced in the trial
court must be considered in the strongest light for the
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; the
same standard applies whether the case was before a judge or
a jury. The test on appeal is not whether guilt is
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was
substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier
of fact. Indeed, even if it could be said in a bench trial
that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence,
as long as there is substantial evidence to support the
requisite findings for conviction, the trial court will be
affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of

sufficient quality and probative value to enable [a person]
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. And as trier
of fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable and
rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including
circumstantial evidence.

(quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai 'i 262, 265, 892 P.2d 455, 458 
(1995) (quotation marks omitted)).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. HRS § 291C-131
 
Bowman contends that he was mischarged under subsection
 
(a) and that the agricultural exception in subsection (c) was the
 
applicable offense for which he should have been charged. In
 contrast, the State contends that, under Hawai
'i case law, the 
exception in subsection (c) constitutes a defense that the State
 
6

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
did not need to include in its charge. We begin our analysis of
 
whether subsection (c) constitutes an offense or defense by
 looking to the words of the statute. 
HRS § 291C-131 provides, in relevant part:
 
§291C-131 Spilling loads on highways; penalties. (a)
No vehicle shall be moved on any highway, unless the vehicle
is so constructed, covered, or loaded as to prevent any of
its load other than clear water or feathers from live birds
 from dropping, sifting, leaking, blowing, spilling, or
otherwise escaping therefrom, except that sand may be
dropped for the purpose of securing traction, or water or
other substance may be sprinkled on a highway in cleaning or
maintaining the highway.
 
. . . . 

(c) Vehicles carrying agricultural produce from fields
during harvesting shall be exempt from the requirements of
this section but the owner of the vehicle must provide for
the reasonable removal of all such produce spilled or
dropped on the highway.
 
. . . . 
(g) Violation of this section shall be considered an
offense as defined in section 701-107(5),[ 
6
] shall not be
subject to the provisions of chapter 291D, and shall subject

the owner or driver of the vehicle, or both, to the
following penalties without possibility of probation or
suspension of sentence:
 
(1)
	 For a first violation, by a fine of not
less than $250 and not more than $500.
 
(2)	 For a second violation involving a vehicle
or driver previously cited under this
section within one year:
 
(A)	 Suspension of the vehicle
registration or suspension of the
license of the driver, or both, for
not less than five working days but
not more than ten working days; and
 
(B)	 A fine of not less than $500
 and not more than $750.
 
(3)	 For a third or subsequent violation
involving a vehicle or driver previously
cited under this section within one year:
 
(A)	 Suspension of the vehicle
registration or suspension of the
license of the driver, or both, for
 
6
 HRS § 701-107(5) (2014 Repl.) provides, in relevant part, that
"[a]n offense defined . . . by any other statute of this State constitutes a
violation if it is so designated . . . in the law defining the
offense . . . ."
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
a period of thirty calendar days;
and
 
(B)	 A fine of not less than $750 and not
 more than $1,000.
 
In imposing a fine under this subsection, the court,
in its discretion, may apportion payment of the fine between
the driver of the vehicle and the owner of the vehicle
 according to the court's determination of the degree of
fault for the violation.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Subsection (a) represents a general requirement that
 
all vehicles must be constructed or covered so to prevent
 
spilling a vehicle's load on a highway. Subsection (c) is an
 exception to the requirements of HRS § 291C-131 for vehicles
 transporting agricultural produce after harvest. 
We are guided by the principle that the court's 
"foremost obligation when interpreting a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself." State v. Lee, 90 Hawai
'i 130, 138, 976 P.2d 444, 452 
(1999) (quoting State v. Bautista, 86 Hawai 'i 207, 209, 948 P.2d 
1048, 1050 (1997) (brackets omitted)). "Yet, even if the plain language of a statute is clear, [the Hawai
'i Supreme Court] can 
nevertheless consider legislative history to ensure its interpretation of the statute does not produce an absurd result contrary to legislative intent." Friends of Makakilo v. D.R. 
Horton-Schuler Homes, LLC, 134 Hawai
'i 135, 139, 338 P.3d 516, 
520 (2014). 
HRS § 291C-131 was first enacted in 1976. 1976 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 137, § 1 at 252-53. The purpose of the statute
 was to "prevent the spilling of loads from vehicles on highways"
 because the legislature believed the laws in place did little to
 prevent "vehicles with uncovered cargo" from "being moved or
 driven on highways posing potential hazards and damage to other
 vehicles." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 346-76, in 1976 House
 Journal, at 1431. The agricultural exception was included in the
 original text of the statute. 1976 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 137, § 1
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 252-53. The legislature enacted and retained the exception
 
for agricultural produce because it believed that the
 "application of the provisions of [HRS § 291C-131] to vehicles
 carrying agricultural produce would cause great hardship to the
 agricultural industry, the Hawaii sugar industry in particular."
 S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 309, in 1977 Senate Journal, at 987.
 
In 1986, the legislature enacted the statute's penalty
 
subsection and provided that "[v]iolations of [HRS § 291C-131]
 shall subject the owner or driver of the vehicle, or both" to
 graduated penalties. 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 175, § 1 at 310­11. In 2000, the penalty section was amended to its current text
 
in HRS § 291C-131(g), providing that a "violation of this section
 shall be considered an offense as defined in section 701­107(5) . . . and shall subject the owner or driver of the
 vehicle, or both" to graduated penalties. 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws
 Act 100, § 1 at 211. HRS § 291C-131's legislative history
 provides little to no insight into whether the legislature
 contemplated treating subsection (c) as an offense or whether the
 legislature intended to apply the graduated penalties to
 violations of subsection (c). Thus, nothing in the legislative
 history of HRS § 291C-131 supports the conclusion that the
 legislature intended to treat subsection (c) as an offense.
 
Bowman suggests that we interpret subsection (c) as an 
offense for agricultural vehicles that fail to reasonably remove spilled produce. However, interpreting subsection (c) in such a manner would yield an absurd result. See Lee, 90 Hawai
'i at 138, 
976 P.2d at 452 ("The legislature is presumed not to intend an absurd result, and legislation will be construed to avoid, if possible, inconsistency, contradiction, and illogicality." (Brackets omitted.)) Application of subsection (c) requires proof of threshold elements of fact, such as whether the vehicle was carrying agricultural produce from fields and whether the vehicle was carrying produce during harvesting, that are squarely within the knowledge and control of the defendant. The State would not have access to the information necessary to properly 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
charge a defendant under subsection (c). This practical concern 
is one factor that Hawai 'i courts have considered in construing 
statutory exceptions as defenses. See State v. Jenkins, 93 
Hawai'i 87, 107, 997 P.2d 13, 33 (2000); See also State v. 
Nobriga, 10 Haw. App. 353, 358, 873 P.2d 110, 113 (1994), overruled on other grounds by State v. Maelega, 80 Hawai
'i 172, 
178-79, 907 P.2d 758, 764-65 (1995), (holding that the general rule that requires the State to establish a fact as part of its case-in-chief is inoperative "when the facts hypothesized in the exceptive provision are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, or the evidence concerning them is within [the defendant's] private control" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has adopted the following 
framework for determining whether a statutory exception is a defense to or an element of an offense: 
The general and well-settled common law rule is that
where an exception is embodied in the language of the
enacting clause of a criminal statute, and therefore appears
to be an integral part of the verbal description of the
offense, the burden is on the prosecution to negative that
exception, prima facie, as part of its main case.
 
When the exception appears somewhere other than in the
enacting clause, and is thus a distinct substantive
exception or proviso, the burden is on the defendant to
bring forward evidence of exceptive facts that constitute a
defense. The prosecutor is not required in such instances to
negative, by proof in advance, exceptions not found in the
enacting clause.
 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai 'i at 106-07, 997 P.2d at 32-33 (internal 
citations, brackets, and ellipses omitted). See State v. Romano, 
114 Hawai 'i 1, 6, 155 P.3d 1102, 1107 (2007), as amended (Mar. 
30, 2007); Lee, 90 Hawai 'i at 138, 976 P.2d at 452; Nobriga, 10 
Haw. App. at 357-58, 873 P.2d at 112-13 (all holding that when an 
exception appears somewhere other than in the enacting clause and negatives penal liability, it is to be treated as a defense for which the defendant carries the initial burden of production). 
The State cites to Romano in support of its contention
 
that subsection (c) is a defense for which Bowman carried the
 initial burden of production. In Romano, a defendant was charged
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with violating HRS § 712-1200(1) [(1993)] for committing the 
offense of prostitution. Romano, 114 Hawai 'i at 7, 155 P.3d at 
7
1108. HRS § 712-1200(1)  establishes when a person commits the
act of prostitution, but another subsection of the prostitution statute, HRS § 712-1200(5) [(1993)], provides that "[t]his section shall not apply to any member of a police department, a sheriff, or a law enforcement officer acting in the course and scope of duties, unless engaged in sexual penetration or sadomasochistic abuse." 
Based on the exception in HRS § 712­
1200(5), the defendant in 
Romano argued that the State carried 
the burden to prove that she was not a law enforcement officer. Romano, 114 Hawai
'i at 3, 155 P.3d at 1104. 
The supreme court in Romano determined that because the
 
exception in HRS § 712-1200(5) would "negative" the prostitution
 offense and was found in a "separate and distinct" subsection of
 the statute, the exception constituted a defense for which the
 defendant had the initial burden of production. Id. at 6, 155
 
P.3d at 1107. The Romano court determined that the State did not
 have to disprove defendant's defense until defendant adduced
 evidence that she fell within the exception. Id.;
 
HRS § 701–115(2) (2014 Repl.) ("No defense may be considered by
 the trier of fact unless evidence of the specified fact or facts
 has been presented.") The Romano court held that because
 defendant did not adduce any evidence in support of her defense,
 the State was not required to negate the defense. Id. 
Subsection (a) and subsection (c) of HRS § 291C-131 are
 
analogous to the statutory provisions at issue in Romano. 
Subsection (a) represents a general requirement that motor
 vehicles be covered so to prevent spilling loads on highways,
 while subsection (c) represents an exception to the requirement
 
HRS § 712-1200(1) (1993) provided :
 
§ 712-1200 Prostitution. (1) A person commits the
offense of prostitution if the person engages in, or
agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct with
another person for a fee.
 
11
 7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for vehicles transporting agricultural produce from fields during
 
harvesting, so long as the vehicles reasonably remove any produce
 that may have fallen. Subsection (c) negatives liability under
 subsection (a) and is also found within a separate and distinct
 subsection of HRS § 291C-131. Under Romano, subsection (c)
 constitutes a defense for which Bowman carried the initial burden
 of production. 
B. Sufficiency of Charge
 
Because we hold that subsection (c) constitutes a 
defense, the State was not required to include the elements of subsection (c) in its oral charge against Bowman. See State v. 
Adams, 64 Haw. 568, 569, 645 P.2d 308, 309 (1982) ("It has long been held that indictments need not anticipate and negate possible defenses; rather, it is left to the defendant to show his defenses at trial.") "[T]he sufficiency of the charging instrument is measured, inter alia, by whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he or she must be prepared to meet." State v. Cummings, 101 Hawai
'i 139, 142, 63 P.3d 1109, 
1112 (2003) (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Here, the State's oral charge set forth the essential elements of the subsection (a) offense and, therefore, was sufficient to apprise Bowman of the nature of the State's accusation against him. C. Sufficiency of Evidence
 Bowman contends that the State failed to prove all the
 
elements of subsection (c) beyond a reasonable doubt. In support
 of his contention, Bowman alleges that "[t]he prosecution did not
 present any evidence regarding the ownership of the vehicle" and
 "[t]he prosecution presented no evidence through Officer Fuiava
 of any efforts or lack of effort to remove the lettuce or cabbage
 from the highway."
 
The State carries the burden of proof in two
 
situations: (1) When proving elements of an offense and (2) when
 negativing the elements of a defense, if the defendant first
 
12
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provides evidence in support of the defense. Romano, 114 Hawai 'i 
at 6, 155 P.3d at 1107; see also HRS § 701–115(2). Because 
subsection (c) constitutes a defense, Bowman carried the burden of production to produce evidence in support of his subsection (c) defense. Thus, any failure to present evidence as to one of
 the elements of subsection (c) is fatal to Bowman's defense and
 not the State's case-in-chief.
 
There was sufficient evidence to support Bowman's
 
conviction. The district court did not make a ruling as to
 whether Bowman satisfied the "owner" requirement of subsection
 (c), as defined under HRS § 291C-1 (2007 Repl.).
8 Instead, the
 
district court determined that Bowman's subsection (c) defense
 failed because Bowman failed to reasonably remove the spilled
 produce.
9
 
During his trial, Bowman testified that when he
 
returned to the location where he spilled his cabbage trimmings
 three to four hours after receiving his citation, he "did not see
 any of [the trimmings]" on the road and felt that "risk of life
 and limb, running onto the road, grabbing three or four leaves of
 cabbage as opposed to letting it decompose naturally [did] not
 sound reasonable . . . ." In response, the district court found
 that Bowman did not act reasonably when he "just left [the
 trimmings] on the road." The district court reasoned that "had
 [Bowman] gone and picked it up, [he] would have been acquitted of
 this charge."
 
"We have long held that evidence adduced in the trial
 
court must be considered in the strongest light for the [State]
 when the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such
 
8
 HRS § 291C-1 (Statewide Traffic Code) defines "owner" as "a
person, other than a lien holder, having the property in or title to a
vehicle. The term includes a person entitled to the use and possession of a
vehicle subject to a security interest in another person, but excludes a
lessee under a lease not intended as security."
 
9
 Because we affirm the district court's determination that Bowman
 
did not provide for the reasonable removal of the spilled produce, we need not
determine whether Bowman produced evidence as to the "owner" of the vehicle so
to overcome his burden of production.

evidence to support a conviction[.]" Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i at 135, 
913 P.2d at 61; Associated Eng'r & Contractors, Inc. v. State, 58 
Haw. 322, 322, 568 P.2d 512, 513 (1977) (holding that evidence of a defense is viewed in the light most favorable to the State). While the State carries the ultimate burden of persuasion, it satisfies its burden "when the [trier of fact] believes its case and disbelieves the defense." HRS § 701-115 cmt. (2014 Repl.); State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai
'i 472, 483, 927 P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996) 
("The prosecution disproves a justification defense beyond a reasonable doubt when the trial court believes the prosecution's case and disbelieves the defendant's case.") Viewing the evidence in the strongest light for the State and giving due deference to the district court's factual determinations, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the district court's finding that Bowman did not reasonably remove the spilled produce and, therefore, did not avail himself of the subsection (c) defense to his subsection (a) charge.
