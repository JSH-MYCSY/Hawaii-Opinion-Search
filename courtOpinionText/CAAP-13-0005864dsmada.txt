IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI fI 
DISCOVER BANK, a Delaware Corporation, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADFORD W. ADAMS and EI RAYNA K. ADAMS, Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC09-1-9133)
 
ORDER
 
(1) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
 
(2) DENYING AS MOOT ANY AND ALL PENDING MOTIONS
IN APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-13–0005864
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendants-Appellants
 
Bradford W. Adams and Ei Rayna K. Adams (the Adams Appellants)
 have asserted from the Honorable Hilary B. Gangnes's following
 two interlocutory orders:
 
(1) an October 29, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion for dismissal and judgment on
the merits; and
 
(2) a November 6, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion for "review" of the October 29,
2013 order.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2013) authorizes an appeal from a final order or final judgment
 
of a district court.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies . . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished
. . . . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai fi 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
fi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
fi 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai fi at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). In the instant case, the district court has 
not yet entered a final order or final judgment that ends this litigation by adjudicating all claims and leaving nothing further to be adjudicated. Absent a final order or final judgment that resolves all claims in this case, we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-1(a) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142.
 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), neither of the two appealed interlocutory orders satisfies the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
fi 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
fi 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS

§ 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an
 
interlocutory order). 
Absent a final order or final judgment that adjudicates
 
all of the parties' claims, the Adams Appellants' appeal is
 premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0005864 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005864 are denied as
 moot.
