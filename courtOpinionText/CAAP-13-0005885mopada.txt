ANGELINA U. LARDIZABAL, Claimant-Appellant/Cross-Appellee,
v. NO KA OI PRODUCERS, INC., Employer-Appellee/Cross-Appellee,
and FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD., Insurance Carrier-
Appellee/Cross-Appellee, and SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND,
Appellee/Cross-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2012-021; (2-06-45436))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Angelina U. Lardizabal (Lardizabal)
 
appeals from the Labor and Industrial Relations Board's (LIRAB)
 
Decision and Order, filed on November 27, 2013 (Decision and
 Order). Lardizabal challenges, inter alia, the LIRAB's denial of
 permanent total disability (PTD) benefits under the odd-lot
 doctrine. Appellee-Cross-Appellant Special Compensation Fund
 
(SCF) cross-appeals from the LIRAB's Decision and Order, claiming
 
that the LIRAB erroneously apportioned permanent partial
 
disability (PPD) benefits between Employer-Appellee No Ka Oi
 
Producers, Inc. (No Ka Oi) and the SCF.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The LIRAB determined that Lardizabal was entitled to
 
16% PPD benefits for her left hand, $500.00 for disfigurement and
 
that the PPD award should be apportioned with the SCF. In doing
 so, the LIRAB: (1) affirmed the Director of the Department of
 Labor and Industrial Relations' (Director's) award of $500.00 for
 
disfigurement, and the denial of PTD benefits in the October 25,
 
2011 decision; (2) modified the Director's 16% PPD award in the
 
1
October 25, 2011 decision;  (3) reversed the Director's denial of
No Ka Oi's request for contribution with the SCF in the October
 25, 2011 decision; and (4) vacated the Director's December 5,
 2011 amended decision.
 
Lardizabal raises three points of error on appeal,

 
contending that the LIRAB erred in:
 
(1) finding that Lardizabal did not establish a prima
 
facie case that she fell within the odd-lot category;
 
(2) finding that suitable employment was regularly and
 
continuously available to Lardizabal, despite her limitations;
 and 
(3) finding that Lardizabal's work-related injury did
 
not render her permanently totally disabled within the odd-lot
 category. 
Lardizabal also argues that she is entitled to a "PPD
 
award of 40% impairment of the hand, plus 5% for residuals for a
 
1
 In its October 25, 2011 decision, the Director concluded that
Lardizabal is entitled to an award of 16% PPD for her left hand. However, the
Director ordered that No Ka Oi "pay to [Lardizabal] weekly compensation of
$166.67 for 13% [PPD] of the hand[.]" In its December 5, 2011 amended
decision, the Director concluded that Lardizabal "is entitled to an award of
16% PPD of the left hand and certain disfigurement."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3total of 45% impairment of the hand," 25% PPD of the ring finger,
and $1,000.00 for disfigurement. 
The SCF raises six points of error on appeal,
contending that:
(1)  the LIRAB applied the wrong standard by treating
Lardizabal's injury as the result of an accident, rather than a
cumulative trauma;
 (2) the LIRAB clearly erred when it credited "medical
apportionments" that did not meet the legal requirements of
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 386-33 (2015);
(3) the LIRAB clearly erred when it credited permanent
preexisting disabilities that had the potential to fluctuate over
time;
(4) The LIRAB clearly erred in crediting the opinions
of doctors who made incorrect assumptions regarding work
experiences;
(5) The LIRAB erred when it relied on clearly erroneous
findings of fact (FOFs) not relevant to the issue of legal
apportionment to conclude that apportionment of the PPD with the
SCF was appropriate; and
(6) The LIRAB erred in concluding that Lardizabal had a
preexisting impairment sufficient to establish apportionment
pursuant to HRS ยง 386-33.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve the parties' contentions as follows: NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
  Kalapodes2 Lardizabal argues that her right hand disability should be a
factor in establishing a prima facie case under the odd-lot doctrine.  The
LIRAB determined that the "Director only determined the compensability of
[Lardizabal's] left hand; therefore, the compensability of any alleged injury
to [Lardizabal's] right hand is not before the [LIRAB].  The [LIRAB] makes nofinding with respect to [Lardizabal's] right hand."  Thus, the LIRAB did not
reach the issue of whether Lardizabal sustained a work-related permanent
partial disability to her right hand in its Decision and Order.  As such, wewill not address the extent of Lardizabal's right hand disability.
v. E.E. Black, Ltd., 66 Haw. 561, 565, 669 P.3d 635, 637 (1983) (citing Demond
v. Univ. of Haw., 54 Haw. 98, 103, 503 P.2d 434, 437 (1972)).  
4Lardizabal's Appeal
(1)Lardizabal contends that she is entitled to PTD
benefits under the odd-lot category because "she is old (68),
poorly educated, [has] no transferable skills, only has manual
labor experiences with the use of both hands, and has severe
disability to use both hands."2  Lardizabal appears to challenge
FOF 12, which states in pertinent part, the LIRAB "finds that
[Lardizabal] failed to make the prima facie case that she fell
within the odd lot category." 
Under the odd-lot doctrine, "where an employee receives
a work-related permanent partial disability which combined with
other factors such as age, education, experience, etc., rendershim, in fact, unable to obtain employment, he is entitled to betreated as being permanently totally disabled."  Tsuchiyama v.Kahului Trucking & Storage Inc., 2 Haw. App. 659, 660-61, 638P.2d 1381, 1382 (1982).  The employee has the burden ofestablishing a prima facie case that he or she falls within theodd-lot category.  Id. at 661, 638 P.2d at 1382 (citationomitted).  Furthermore, 
[i]f the evidence of degree of obvious physical impairment,
coupled with other facts such as claimant's mental capacity,
education, training, or age, places claimant prima facie in
the odd-lot category, the burden should be on the employer 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
to show that some kind of suitable work is regularly and
continuously available to the claimant.
 
Yarnell v. City Roofing Inc., 72 Haw. 272, 275, 813 P.2d 1386,
 
1388 (1991) (citation omitted). 
In Tsuchiyama, claimant injured his back while at work. 
Tsuchiyama, 2 Haw. App. at 660, 638 P.2d at 1382. Claimant was
 "off the job for almost three years, during which time his back
 was operated on for surgical excision of a disk." Id. In
 
addition, "[o]rthopedic surgeons evaluated the permanent
 disability of the whole man at between 16% and 25%." Id. This
 
court concluded that given the claimant's age, education,
 difficulty with the English language, limp, and limitations of
 motion, the LIRAB was not clearly erroneous in finding that "no
 regular gainful employment existed for [the Claimant] in his
 present condition." Id. at 662, 638 P.2d at 1383. 
Here, in reaching its determination that Lardizabal had
 
"failed to make the prima facie case that she fell within the odd
 lot category" in FOF 12, the LIRAB credited the impairment
 ratings of Drs. Brian Y. Mihara (Dr. Mihara), Lance A. Yokochi
 
(Dr. Yokochi), Peter E. Diamond (Dr. Diamond), Lorne K. Direnfeld
 (Dr. Direnfeld), and Christopher Brigham (Dr. Brigham). Dr.
 Mihara opined Lardizabal's impairment with regard to the left
 
hand as "7% of the hand as per Hawaii Convention." Dr. Yokochi
 opined Lardizabal's impairment as "3% impairment of the hand for
 the left carpal tunnel syndrome (wrist condition) and 7%
 impairment of the left ring finger for her left ring finger
 trigger finger condition." Dr. Diamond opined Lardizabal's
 impairment as "10% for the sensory change combined with 2% for
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motor change, for a total of 12% impairment, upper extremity." 
Dr. Direnfeld opined Lardizabal's impairment as "sensory loss
 (10%) and motor loss (2%)" for a total of 12% impairment of the
 upper extremity. Dr. Brigham agreed with Drs. Diamond and
 Direnfeld's impairment rating of 13% for Lardizabal's left carpal
 tunnel syndrome. Based on the minimal degree of physical
 impairment indicated in Drs. Mihara, Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld,
 and Brigham opinions, the LIRAB determined that Lardizabal
 "failed to make the prima facie case that she fell within the
 odd-lot category." 
In determining whether a claimant satisfied his or her
 
burden of proof, the odd-lot doctrine requires consideration of
 "physical impairment coupled with other facts such as claimant's
 mental capacity, education, training, [and] age." Yarnell, 72
 
Haw. at 275, 813 P.3d at 1388. Furthermore, "there is a
 presumption that, if claimant suffers physically, and bears the
 additional characteristics, then he [or she] has proved the prima
 facie case." Id. The LIRAB noted that Lardizabal was 67 years
 
old, and found that her primary language was Ilocano and that she
 spoke little English. The LIRAB also found that Lardizabal did
 not finish high school, and "did not attend any other formal
 education, specialized training, or vocational training." Given
 her physical impairment, age, lack of education, work
 experiences, and difficultly with English, it appears that
 Lardizabal established a prima facie case that she fell within
 the odd-lot doctrine. Thus, the LIRAB's FOF 12 was clearly 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
erroneous. See Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai 'i 402, 406, 38 
P.3d 570, 574 (2001) (citations and brackets omitted). 
(2) Once a claimant has established a prima facie
 
case, then the employer has the "burden to prove the existence of
 
regular suitable employment." Yarnell, 72 Haw. at 275, 813 P.2d
 
at 1388. "Case law clearly establishes that it is a question of
 fact as to whether a person falls into an odd-lot category[,]"
 and "shifting the burden of proof is a question of law." Id. at
 
276, 813 P.2d at 1389 (citation omitted). The question of
 whether an employer had "either failed or succeeded in its burden
 of proof that there [is] suitable employment" is a factual
 question. Id. 
As Lardizabal established a prima facie case that she
 
fell within the odd-lot doctrine, the burden shifted to No Ka Oi
 to prove the existence of regular suitable employment. Id. at
 
275, 813 P.2d at 1388. In FOF 13, the LIRAB found that "[w]ith
 respect to [Lardizabal's] vocational prospects in the labor
 market, the [LIRAB] finds the opinions of Ms. Havre credible and
 persuasive and credits them over those of Ms. Hamano." In a
 report dated October 28, 2012, Havre conducted a transferable
 
skills analysis that focused on "the work fields of the sewing
 
machine operator, sandwich maker, homemaker and child monitor. 
Of these jobs, the hostess, ticket taker and parking lot
 attendant job titles were identified[.]" Havre noted that
 Lardizabal is "able to learn and effectively improve remedial
 English language skills as demonstrated by her graduation from
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
3
high school while in the Phillippines,"  and is able to "learn
and apply new job skills via on-the-job training as evidenced by
 
her successful advancement to a supervisory capacity that
 involved training employees while working in the Philippines." 
Havre concluded that "Lardizabal is not permanently and totally
 disabled, and should be able to return to work again[.]" 
Although the LIRAB credited Havre's opinions, the LIRAB 
failed to make factual findings indicating whether No Ka Oi "either failed or succeeded in its burden of proof that there was suitable employment[.]" Yarnell, 72 Hawai
'i at 276, 813 P.3d at 
1389. The LIRAB "must make its findings reasonably clear. The parties and the court should not be left to guess, with respect to any material question of fact, or to any group of minor matters that may have cumulative significance, the precise finding of the agency." In re Hawaiian Tel. Co., 54 Haw. 663, 
668, 513 P.2d 1376, 1379 (1973) (quoting In re Terminal Transp. Inc., 54 Haw. 134, 139, 504 P.2d 1214, 1217 (1972)). Thus, this court will not speculate as to whether No Ka Oi "either failed or succeeded in its burden of proof that there was suitable employment[.]" Yarnell, 72 Hawai
'i at 276, 813 P.3d at 1389. 
Accordingly, we remand this case with instructions that the LIRAB determine whether No Ka Oi proved the existence of regular suitable employment. 
(3) It appears that Lardizabal is challenging LIRAB's
 
Conclusion of Law (COL) 1, which states, inter alia, the LIRAB
 
3
 Lardizabal testified that she did not graduate from high school;
Havre's testimony apparently was based on a job application completed by
Lardizabal that represented that she graduated from high school.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"concludes that [Lardizabal] is neither permanently totally
 
disabled on a medical basis nor is she permanently totally
 disabled on an odd-lot basis." In light of our conclusions that
 Lardizabal established a prima facie showing on her odd-lot claim
 and that the LIRAB failed to make the necessary factual findings
 concerning whether No Ka Oi met its burden of proof, we must
 vacate the conclusion stated in COL 1.
 
(4) Lardizabal argues that she "currently has a
 
combined sensory deficit or pain and motor loss deficit due to
 carpal tunnel syndrome, equivalent to 40% permanent impairment of
 the hand." In support of her argument, Lardizabal contends that
 Dr. Diamond erroneously interpreted the American Medical
 Association (AMA) Guides. Thus, Lardizabal appears to challenge
 
FOF 4 in the LIRAB's Decision and Order, which states in relevant
 
part that the LIRAB "credits Dr. Diamond's opinions that
 [Lardizabal] sustained permanent impairment and that
 apportionment was appropriate due to [Lardizabal's] pre-existing
 condition." 
Under Hawaii Administrative Rule (HAR) ยง 12-10-21, 
"[i]mpairment rating guides issued by the American Medical Association . . . may be used as a reference or guide in measuring a disability." Thus, while the AMA Guides are a helpful tool in determining disability, the LIRAB is not bound by them. Cabatbat v. Cty of Haw., Dep't. of Water Supply, 103 
Hawai
'i 1, 6, 78 P.3d 756, 761 (2003). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
has recognized that "physicians must be allowed to draw on their medical expertise and judgment to evaluate the numerous factors 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
relating to an individual's impairment rating and to determine 
which [AMA Guides] would be most appropriate to apply." Duque v. 
Hilton Hawaiian Vill., 105 Hawai 'i 433, 435, 98 P.3d 640, 642 
(2004). 
Based on a physical examination and interpretation of 
the AMA Guides, Dr. Diamond opined Lardizabal's impairment as "10% for the sensory change combined with 2% for motor change, for a total of 12% impairment, upper extremity." Lardizabal failed to present evidence at the LIRAB hearing to dispute Dr. Diamond's impairment rating. Viewing the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, with the LIRAB determining credibility, we conclude that FOF 4 was not clearly erroneous. Igawa, 97 
Hawai
'i at 406, 38 P.3d at 574; Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, 
Inc., 97 Hawai 'i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001). 
Second, Lardizabal argues that she is entitled to 25%
 
PPD of the ring finger. In support of her argument, Lardizabal
 challenges Dr. Yokochi's clinical findings and interpretation of
 the AMA Guides. Thus, it appears that Lardizabal challenges FOF
 3 in the LIRAB's Decision and Order, which states in pertinent
 part that the LIRAB "credits Dr. Yokochi's opinions, including
 his opinion that [Lardizabal] sustained permanent impairment[.]" 
Dr. Yokochi evaluated Lardizabal's range of motion for
 
her left wrist and ring finger using the AMA Guides. In a report
 dated June 5, 2008, Dr. Yokochi wrote that Lardizabal's sensory
 deficit is "greater than 15 mm two-point discrimination in all
 fingertips, except for her left small finger." Based on
 Lardizabal's clinical status and the reports of Drs. Richard
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Mengato, Mihara, and Antonio B. Cordero, Dr. Yokochi was not able 
to determine Lardizabal's sensory impairment. As discussed, "physicians must be allowed to draw on their medical expertise and judgment to evaluate the numerous factors relating to an individual's impairment rating and to determine which [AMA Guides] would be most appropriate to apply." Duque, 105 Hawai
'i 
at 435, 98 P.3d at 642. Lardizabal failed to present evidence at the LIRAB hearing to dispute Dr. Yokochi's clinical findings and interpretation of the AMA Guides. Viewing the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, with the LIRAB determining credibility, we conclude that FOF 3 was not clearly erroneous. Igawa, 97 Hawai
'i at 406, 38 P.3d at 574; Tamashiro, 97 Hawai 'i at 
92, 34 P.3d at 22. 
Lastly, Lardizabal contends that she is "entitled to 
$1,000.00 for disfigurement, which includes, scarring, pseudo clawing, and locking of the ring finger." However, Lardizabal present no discernable argument regarding this contention. Therefore, we conclude that this contention is without merit. See, e.g., Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i 126, 144 n.16, 276 
P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (citation omitted). SCF's Cross-Appeal 
An employer may apportion permanent disability benefits
 
with the SCF under HRS ยง 386-33, which states in relevant part:
 
(a) Where prior to any injury an employee suffers from
a previous permanent partial disability already existing
prior to the injury for which compensation is claimed, and
the disability resulting from the injury combines with the
previous disability, whether the previous permanent partial
disability was incurred during past or present periods of
employment, to result in a greater permanent partial
disability or in permanent total disability or in death,
then weekly benefits shall be paid as follows:
 
11
  Subsection (b) of HRS ยง 386-33 authorizes the director
or the [LIRAB] to apportion liability with SCF if the
Director or [LIRAB] determines that the previous permanent
partial disability amounted to an award of thirty-two weeks
of compensation.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1) 	In cases where the disability resulting from the
injury combines with the previous disability to
result in greater permanent partial disability
the employer shall pay the employee compensation
for the employee's actual permanent partial
disability but for not more than one hundred
four weeks; the balance if any of compensation
payable to the employee for the employee's
actual permanent partial disability shall
thereafter be paid out of the special
compensation fund; provided that in successive
injury cases where the claimant's entire
permanent partial disability is due to more than
one compensable injury, the amount of the award
for the subsequent injury shall be offset by the
amount awarded for the prior compensable injury;
 
. . . . 
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), where the director
or the appellate board determines that the previous
permanent partial disability amounted to less than that
necessary to support an award of thirty-two weeks of
compensation for permanent partial disability, there shall
be no liability on the special compensation fund and the
employer shall pay the employee or the employee's dependents
full compensation for the employee's permanent partial or
total disability or death.
 
The supreme court interpreted HRS ยง 386-33 in Bumanglag
 
v. Oahu Sugar Co., 78 Hawai 'i 275, 892 P.2d 468 (1995), stating: 
[I]n order to obtain an apportionment with SCF,
Employer must first prove three conditions: (1) that
Claimant suffered from a preexisting permanent partial
disability; (2) that the preexisting permanent partial
disability was capable of supporting an award of
thirty-two weeks of compensation; and (3) that the
preexisting disability and the subsequent work-related
injury combined into a greater present disability. 
. . . . 

Id. at 280, 892 P.2d at 473 (footnote omitted).
 
In the instant case, the LIRAB concluded that
 
apportionment with the SCF was appropriate "given the extensive
 
preexisting impairment to [Lardizabal's] left hand which was
 aggravated by conditions at work and found compensable." Thus,
 it appears that the LIRAB concluded that No Ka Oi proved the
 
12
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
three Bumanglag conditions. Id. at 280, 892 P.2d at 473. The
 
SCF argues that No Ka Oi failed to prove the three Bumanglag
 
conditions.
 
(1) In its first point, the SCF argues that the LIRAB
 
erred when it credited various medical professionals who all
 relied on evidence that Lardizabal developed carpal tunnel
 syndrome while working for No Ka Oi to establish a disability
 that pre-existed the workplace carpal tunnel injury. In other
 words, the SCF contends that Lardizabal's carpal tunnel syndrome
 developed during the course of her employment with No Ka Oi, and
 thus is not a preexisting disability under HRS ยง 386-33. 
The Hawai
'i Legislature enacted HRS ยง 386-33 in order 
to "encourage the hiring of persons already handicapped by preexisting permanent partial disabilities. The mechanism by which such encouragement was to be accomplished was to limit the liability of an employer of a previously handicapped worker who suffered a subsequent work-related injury to compensation for the subsequent injury alone." Crawford v. Fin. Plaza Contractors, 64 
Haw. 415, 423, 643 P.3d 48, 53 (1982).
4 As recognized by the 
supreme court, "the Crawford decision necessitated the conclusion that the permanent partial disability not merely preexist the subsequent injury but preexist employment[.]" Survivors of 
4
 Although Crawford involved apportionment of death benefits, the
 
supreme court noted that HRS ยง 386-33 "provides for the apportionment of
whatever benefits our workers' compensation law otherwise provides where the
compensable event results from a combination of preexisting disability and
subsequent work-related injury." Crawford, 64 Haw. at 424 n.10, 643 P.2d at
54 n.10 (emphasis added). Thus, the principles underlying Crawford apply to
death benefits as well as to disability benefits.

Medeiros v. Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 66 Haw. 290, 294, 660 P.2d
 
1316, 1319 (1983).
 
In Medeiros, the claimant "had suffered from severe
 
cardiovascular disease, had suffered a severe myocardial
 infarction two to six weeks prior to his death, and had suffered
 a myocardial infarction, which resulted in his death[.]" Id. at
 
292, 660 P.2d at 1318. At the LIRAB hearing, two doctors
 testified that they were not able to determine when claimant
 developed his cardiovascular disease. Id. at 294-95, 660 P.2d at
 
1320. Furthermore, a review of claimant's medical records
 indicated that he was not suffering from heart disease during the
 course of his employment. Id. at 295, 660 P.2d at 1320. Based
 
on the foregoing, the supreme court was unconvinced that the
 claimant's disease preexisted his employment. Id. at 294-95, 660
 
P.2d at 1320. Thus, the supreme court affirmed the LIRAB's
 decision to deny apportionment. Id. at 296, 660 P.2d at 1320.
 
HRS ยง 386-1 (2015) defines disability as a "loss or
 
impairment of a physical or mental function." In the instant
 case, it appears that the LIRAB identified the impairment to
 Lardizabal's left hand as her preexisting permanent partial
 disability. This case is distinguishable from Mederios because
 there is evidence indicating that Lardizabal's disability existed
 prior to her employment with No Ka Oi. Dr. Mihara opined that
 Lardizabal's "highly repetitive, high volume" work activity at No
 Ka Oi could reasonably have worsened her carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Dr. Mihara noted that Lardizabal's carpal tunnel syndrome injury
 was partially preexisting prior to her employment with No Ka Oi. 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Yokochi wrote that Lardizabal "worked in a garment factory
 
for 20 years in the Philippines, when she possibly had first
 onset of her symptoms." Dr. Yokochi noted that "there is
 indication in the medical records of prior symptoms dating even
 to the time that [Lardizabal] lived in the Philippines." Dr.
 Direnfeld noted that "there is unequivocal evidence that the
 condition of carpal tunnel syndrome predated the 1/1/05
 administratively used injury date." Dr. Brigham wrote that "[i]f
 one identifies 'cumulative trauma' as a cause, this would
 [relate] both to her 'January 1, 2005 injury' and to the effects
 of prior work in the garment industry and likely non-occupational
 activities[.]" Dr. Diamond opined that "it would be reasonable
 to conclude that [Lardizabal's] work activities did aggravate and
 accelerate the carpal tunnel process, but are not wholly
 responsible for the ongoing symptoms." 
Based on the foregoing, there is evidence indicating 
that Lardizabal's disability existed prior to her employment with No Ka Oi. Despite the SCF's arguments to the contrary, there is no evidence in the record indicating that Drs. Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld, and Brigham relied on evidence that Lardizabal developed carpal tunnel syndrome while working for No Ka Oi in determining that Lardizabal suffered from a preexisting disability. We decline to disturb LIRAB's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight it gives to the evidence. Tamashiro, 97 Hawai
'i at 92, 34 P.3d at 22. 
Therefore, we cannot conclude that the LIRAB erred in crediting the opinions of Drs. Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld, and Brigham. 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) SCF argues that the LIRAB clearly erred when it
 
credited "'medical apportionments' without first determining
 
whether the medical opinions met the requirements of HRS ยง 386ยญ33." The SCF challenges Drs. Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld, and
 Brigham's opinions in FOFs 3, 4, 6, and 8.
 
Citing Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 53
 
Haw. 406, 495 P.2d 1164 (1972), the SCF argues that "while it may
 be medically sound to perform a 'medical apportionment,' the
 medical apportionment would not establish legal apportionment
 unless it also satisfied the requirements of HRS ยง 386-33." In
 Akamine, claimant collapsed while pushing a hand truck at work. 
Id. at 407, 495 P.2d at 1165. Shortly thereafter, claimant died
 from acute coronary insufficiency. Id. An expert testified that
 
there was no connection between claimant's death and employment
 based on his belief that "heart diseases originate early in life
 and [Claimant's] pre-existing pathological condition was the sole
 cause of death." Id. at 410-11, 495 P.2d at 1167 (footnotes
 
omitted). The supreme court stated that:
 
To allow a medical expert to give his opinion as to whether
legal causation existed in a particular case could lead to
an unjust result. For "a medical man may give a generalized
opinion that there was no connection between an incident at
work and a heart attack, and, in his own mind, may mean
thereby that a pre-existing pathological condition was the
overwhelming factor in bringing about the attack and that
the part played by the work was insignificant. But, while it
may be sound medically to say that the work did not 'cause'
the attack, it may be bad law, because, in general, existing
law treats the slightest factor of aggravation as an
adequate 'cause'."
 
Id. at 410, 495 P.2d at 1167 (quoting DeFries v. Ass'n of
 
Owners). However, the supreme court has recognized that Akamine
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"does not stand for, and we do not uphold, the proposition that 
medical opinions must address or rebut the legal presumption imposed by statute." Korsak v. Haw. Permanente Med. Grp., 94 
Hawai
'i 297, 308, 12 P.3d 1238, 1249 (2000). Accordingly, 
despite the SCF's arguments to the contrary, a doctor's opinion regarding medical apportionment does not have to address or rebut the requirements listed in HRS ยง 386-33. As such, we are not persuaded by SCF's reliance on Akamine. 
In the instant case, Drs. Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld, 
and Brigham based their respective impairment ratings on the AMA Guides. The AMA Guides describe apportionment as a "distribution or allocation of causation among multiple factors that caused or significantly contributed to the injury or disease and resulting impairment. The factor could be a preexisting injury, illness, or impairment." Gunnar B.J. Andersson, Linda Cocciarella, Am. Med. Ass'n, Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment 11 (5th ed. 2000). Furthermore, the "apportionment analysis must consider the nature of the impairment and its possible relationship to each alleged factor, and it must provide an explanation of the medical basis for all conclusions and opinions." Id. at 12. As discussed, "physicians must be allowed 
to draw on their medical expertise and judgment to evaluate the numerous factors relating to an individual's impairment rating and to determine which [AMA Guides] would be most appropriate to apply." Duque, 105 Hawai
'i at 435, 98 P.3d at 642.

Dr. Yokochi concluded that he would "apportion 50% of
 
the final impairment due to the industrial injury dated 01/01/05
 
for recording purposes and 50% of the final impairment to all of
 her pre-existing factors, including her prior occupational
 history, female gender, and age." Dr. Diamond apportioned 50% of
 Lardizabal's impairment to a preexisting condition. Dr.
 Direnfeld agreed with the apportionments provided by Drs. Yokochi
 and Diamond. As such, Dr. Direnfeld noted that "there would be
 6.5% impairment of the left hand attributable to the effects of
 the 1/1/05 industrial accident." Dr. Brigham concluded that 2%
 of the impairment was apportionable to the January 1, 2005
 injury, and 11% of the impairment predated the January 1, 2005
 injury. As discussed above, it was within LIRAB's discretion to
 decide what weight to give Drs. Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld, and
 Brigham's opinions. Based on the record in this case, we cannot
 conclude that the LIRAB erred in crediting the opinions of Drs.
 Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld, and Brigham. 
(3) SCF argues that the LIRAB clearly erred when it
 
credited permanent preexisting disabilities that had the
 potential to fluctuate over time. SCF argues that a permanent
 
preexisting disability "cannot change as a claimant's condition
 
following the work injury improves or worsens." SCF cites no
 legal authority in support of this proposition and we find none.
 
(4) SCF argues that the LIRAB clearly erred in
 
crediting the opinions of doctors who made incorrect assumptions
 regarding Lardizabal's prior work experience in the Philippines. 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
19In particular, the SCF challenges the opinions of Drs. Mihara and
Yokochi in FOFs 2 and 3.  The SCF also argues that Drs. Miharaand Yokochi's opinions contradicted Lardizabal's testimony.  Asdiscussed above, upon our review of the record, we decline todisturb LIRAB's assessment of the credibility of the witnessesand the weight of the evidence.  We cannot conclude that theLIRAB erred in crediting the opinions of Drs. Mihara and Yokochi.
(5 & 6)  The SCF's fifth and sixth points of error are
related.  In its fifth point of error, the SCF argues that theLIRAB erred when it "relied on clearly erroneous [FOFs] notrelevant to the issue of legal apportionment to conclude thatapportionment of the [PPD] with the SCF was appropriate."  In itssixth point of error, the SCF argues that the LIRAB erred inconcluding that Lardizabal had a preexisting impairmentsufficient to establish apportionment under HRS ยง 386-33. In bothpoints, the SCF challenges COL c, which states in relevant part: 
The [LIRAB] having credited the impairment opinions of
the various physicians noted herein above, including the
opinion of Dr. Direnfeld, apportionment of the permanentpartial disability with the [SCF] is appropriate under theworkers' compensation statute given the extensivepreexisting impairment to [Lardizabal's] left hand which wasaggravated by conditions at work and found compensable. 
"A COL that presents mixed questions of fact and law is
reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the
conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of theparticular case."  Igawa, 97 Hawai
#i at 406, 38 P.3d at 574
(citation omitted). NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Bumanglag, the issue before the court was whether 
the "[LIRAB] was clearly erroneous in finding that the Claimant 
did not suffer from a preexisting permanent partial disability capable of supporting an award of thirty-two weeks compensation." Bumanglag, 78 Hawai
'i at 280, 892 P.2d at 473. The supreme court 
noted that the purpose of the thirty-two week threshold was "to significantly reduce the total number of cases in which the [SCF] is required to participate[.]" Id. at 280 n.3, 892 P.2d at 473 
n.3 (citing S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 215, in 1982 Senate Journal,
 at 1041) (brackets in original). In Bumanglag, Dr. John
 Hendrickson (Dr. Hendrickson) opined that 20% to 25% of
 
claimant's overall impairment was attributable to preexisting
 
congenital defects. Id. at 278, 892 P.2d at 471. In its
 
decision, the LIRAB stated: 
We find no evidence in the record to conclude that
 
Claimant had a pre-existing permanent partial disability
sufficient to support an award of thirty-two (32) weeks of
compensation, pursuant to HRS ยง 386โ33. In this case we are
unable to credit Dr. [Hendrickson's] July 1, 1991 opinion.
Even if we were to accept Dr. Hendrickson's opinion as to
Claimant's preexisting impairment for his low back
condition, and apply it to the highest permanent impairment
rating for the lumbar region (11% of the whole person), 20
to 25% of 11% would provide, at most, 2.75% pre-existing
permanent partial disability of the whole person. Permanent
partial disability of 2.75% of the whole person is equal to
10.71 weeks of compensation at Claimant's weekly benefits
rate of $233.05. It has not been shown that Claimant has a
 pre-existing permanent partial disability of 32 weeks of
compensation necessary to warrant apportionment with SCF.
 
Id. (ellipses omitted). Accordingly, the supreme court held that
 
the LIRAB did not err when it concluded that apportionment with
 the SCF was not appropriate. Id. at 280, 892 P.2d at 473.

No Ka Oi argues that the "substantial, credible and
 
persuasive evidence in the record also shows that the preexisting
 
[PPD] was capable of supporting an award of thirty-two weeks
 compensation[.]" In particular, No Ka Oi contends that the
 "LIRAB's decision to credit the undisputed evidence of Drs.
 Yokochi, Diamond, Direnfeld and Brigham was not clearly
 erroneous." Dr. Diamond apportioned 50% of Lardizabal's 12%
 impairment to a preexisting condition. Dr. Direnfeld opined that
 "there would be 6.5% impairment of the left hand attributable to
 the effects of the 1/1/05 industrial accident." Dr. Brigham
 concluded that 11% of Lardizabal's impairment predated the
 January 1, 2005 injury. Under the formula proposed by No Ka Oi,
 Drs. Diamond, Direnfeld, and Brigham's impairment ratings and
 apportionment opinions support an award over thirty-two weeks of
 compensation.
5 However, Dr. Yokochi apportioned 1.5% impairment
 
to preexisting factors. Under the formula proposed by No Ka Oi,
 Dr. Yokochi's preexisting impairment rating does not support an
 award capable of thirty-two weeks of compensation.
6 Thus, the
 
LIRAB credited impairment ratings and apportionment opinions that
 
5
 In relying on Dr. Brigham's preexisting impairment rating of 11%,
No Ka Oi avers that "$622.00 state average weekly wage for 2005 x 244 weeks
for hand impairment x 0.11 preexisting impairment = $16,694.48 divided by
$166.67 weekly compensation rate = 100.1648 weeks of compensation." No Ka Oi
 asserts that "[u]tilizing the pre-existing impairment of 6.5% [from Drs.
Diamond and Direnfeld], Employer/Carrier still met the 32-week threshold set
forth in HRS ยง 386-33 ($622.00 state average weekly wage for 2005 x 244 weeks
for hand impairment x 0.11 preexisting impairment = $9864.92 divided by
$166.67 weekly compensation rate = 59.1883 weeks of compensation)." 
6
 Under No Ka Oi's proposed formula, $622.00 state average weekly
wage multiplied by 244 weeks of hand impairment, multiplied by 0.015
preexisting impairment equals $2,276.52. Additionally, $2,276.52 divided by
$166.67 weekly compensation rate equals to 13.6588 weeks of compensation.

both supported and refuted the conclusion that No Ka Oi proved 
the second Bumanglag condition. See Bumanglag, 78 Hawai 'i at 
280, 892 P.2d at 473. Accordingly, we must conclude that the LIRAB's determination that Lardizabal's PPD award should be apportioned is clearly erroneous. See In re Water Use Permit 
Applications, 94 Hawai
'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000) ("[A] 
mixed determination of law and fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to support the finding or determination, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made."). Under HRS ยง 91-14(g) (2012), we vacate the Decision and Order with regard to the issue of apportionment, and remand with instructions that the LIRAB clarify whether No Ka Oi proved that Lardizabal's preexisting PPD supported an award of thirty-two weeks of compensation. 
For these reasons, we vacate the LIRAB's November 27,
 
2013 Decision and Order, and remand to the LIRAB to, inter alia,
 make a factual determination of whether No Ka Oi proved the
 existence of regular suitable employment, and clarify whether No 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Ka Oi proved that Lardizabal's preexisting PPD supported an award
 
of thirty-two weeks of compensation.
