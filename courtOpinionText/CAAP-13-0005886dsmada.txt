ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Alison Joan Sanchez (Appellant Sanchez) has asserted from three
 interlocutory orders the Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe has
 entered:
 
(1) the November 7, 2013 interlocutory "Order Granting
Defendant Eric Caspillo's Motion to Dismiss, or in
the Alternative, for Summary Judgment Filed on
August 6, 2013";
 
(2) the November 7, 2013 interlocutory "Order GrantingDefendants County of Kaua
'i and Kaua 'i Police 
Department's Joinder to Defendant Eric Caspillo'sMotion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, forSummary Judgment Filed on August 6, 2013, FiledAugust 9, 2013"; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) the November 7, 2013 interlocutory "Order Granting
Defendant Barry DeBlake's Motion to Dismiss, or in
the Alternative, for Summary Judgment Filed on
August 6, 2013[.]"
 
None of these three interlocutory orders are 
independently appealable, and the circuit court has not yet 
reduced any dispositive rulings to a separate, final judgment that resolves all of the parties' claims, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013) requires for an appeal from a civil circuit court case under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. When explaining 
the requirement for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641­1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i explained 
that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis; 
citation omitted). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an 
order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On February 5, 2014, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-13-0005886, which does not contain a final judgment. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), none of the three appealed interlocutory orders can satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai
'i 457, 462,319 P.3d 376, 381 (2014) (regarding the two 
requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 
P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for the 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the
 
requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent
 an appealable final judgment that adjudicates all of the parties'
 claims, Appellant Sanchez's appeal is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0005886 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
