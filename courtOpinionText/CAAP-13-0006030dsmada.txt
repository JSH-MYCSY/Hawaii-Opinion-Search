IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CONTINENTAL PACIFIC, LLC by their Managing Agent,

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KO'OLAU LOA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1RC13-1-6195)
 
ORDER
 
(1)
 DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 11(c)(2),
AND
 
(2) ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in appellate case numbers
 
CAAP-13-0006030 and SCPW-13-0006068, it appears that: 
(1) On December 11, 2013, Defendants-Appellants John
 
Wesley Errett and Kaye Anne Kroehler (Appellants) filed a notice
 
of appeal and a motion to expedite the appeal in appellate case
 number CAAP-13-0006030;
  (3) On December 12, 2013, the court denied the motion 
to expedite the appeal without prejudice to Appellants seeking 
mandamus relief in the Hawai 'i Supreme Court; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) Appellants appeal from the district court’s
 
December 10, 2013 order denying their motion to stay destruction
 of a security video in the possession of the district court’s
 administrative office, and seek an order directing the district
 court’s administrative office not to destroy the video;
 
(4) That same day, the appellate clerk informed
 
Appellants that filing fees due upon submission of the notice of
 appeal had not been paid, Appellants had not moved to proceed in
 forma pauperis, and the $270 filing fee was to be paid by
 December 22, 2013, or the matter would be called to court’s
 attention for such action as the court deems proper, including
 dismissal of the appeal;
 
(5) Thereafter, Appellants took no further action in
 
this appeal;
 
(6) Also on December 12, 2013, Appellants filed a 
petition for writ of mandamus in the Hawai
'i Supreme Court in 
case number SCPW-13-0006068, paid the required $150 filing fee, and filed an ex parte motion to shorten time to decide the petition. The petition notes Appellants incorrectly filed an “emergency expedited appeal” in this court, and this court “correctly denied the ex parte motion for immediate ruling” because the correct form of relief was by writ of mandamus; and 
(7) On December 13, 2013, the supreme court denied the
 
mandamus petition and denied the motion to shorten time as moot.

dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within ten (10) days from
 
the date of this order, Appellant’s counsel, Anthony P.
 
Locricchio, shall show good cause why he should not be sanctioned
 for failure to pay the $270 filing fee.
