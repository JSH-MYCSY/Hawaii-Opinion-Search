APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0458(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant/Cross-Claim
 
Defendant/Appellant Josiah Okudara (Appellant Okudara) has
 asserted from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's January 2, 2014
 order denying Appellant Okudara's motion for partial summary
 judgment (the January 2, 2014 interlocutory order), because the
 circuit court has not yet reduced any dispositive rulings to a
 separate judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a)
 (1993 & Supp. 2013) requires for an appeal from a civil circuit

court case under Rule 58 of the Hawai fi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai fi 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
fi 
requires that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai
fi at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
fi 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), the January 2, 2014 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
fi 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 
704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
fi 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order).

Absent an appealable final judgment that adjudicates
 
all of the parties' claims, Appellant Okudara's appeal is
 
premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-13-0006149 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
