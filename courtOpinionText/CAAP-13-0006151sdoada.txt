SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jose M. Rojas Reyes (Reyes) appeals
 
from: (1) the November 18, 2013 "Order Granting Plaintiff HSBC
 Bank USA, National Association, as Trustee for Home Equity Loan
 Trust Series ACE 2006-HE1's [HSBC] Motion for Summary Judgment,
 Filed Herein on July 22, 2013" (Summary Judgment Order); (2) the
 November 18, 2013 "Judgment on Order Granting [HSBC's] Motion for
 Summary Judgment Filed Herein on July 22, 2013, and for
 Possession" (Judgment); and (3) the November 18, 2013 "Writ of
 Possession", entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 (Circuit Court).

On appeal, Reyes argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
when it granted summary judgment to HSBC because the underlying
 mortgages and notes were (1) void and unenforceable because they
 were entered into in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 Chapter 480; (2) voidable as products of constructive fraud;

(3) void and unenforceable as products of fraud in the factum;
 and (4) voidable as products of undue influence.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and
 
 
arguments raised by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 
 
authority, we resolve Reyes's appeal as follows and affirm.
 
 
The issues raised by Reyes in this appeal are barred by
 
 
res judicata. 
 
The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel
provide that the judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction is a bar to a new action in another court
between the same parties or their privies concerning the
same subject matter. It precludes the religitation, not
only of the issues that were actually litigated in the first
action, but also of all grounds of claim and defense which
might have been litigated in the first action but were not
litigated or decided.
 
Santos v. State, Dept. Of Transp., Kauai Div., 64 Haw. 648, 651Â­
52, 646 P.2d 962, 965 (1982). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court in 
Santos further provided the three factors that must be considered in finding whether application of res judicata or collateral estoppel is warranted: "Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question? Was there a final judgment on the merits? Was the party against whom the plea is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?" Santos, 64 Haw. at 653, 
646 P.2d at 966 (citation omitted). 
Applying these general principles to the instant case,
 
it is clear that they preclude our further consideration of
 Reyes's appeal. This appeal arises from an ejectment action by
 HSBC against Reyes seeking his ouster from 648 Kaakolu Street,
 Lahaina, Hawaii 96761 (Subject Property), which was purchased by
 HSBC in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale held on July 7, 2009. 
Reyes challenged HSBC's ownership of the Subject Property as a
 result of this sale, through a lawsuit that became civil case
 number 10-1-0536-03. In Civ. No. 10-1-0536-03, the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit, inter alia, granted HSBC's motion for
 summary judgment and denied Reyes's motions to set aside and to
 reconsider the judgment entered in HSBC's favor. Reyes's appeal
 from the judgments and orders entered in HSBC's favor in Civ.
 No. 10-1-0536-03 was rejected by this court through a summary

disposition order entered on May 29, 2015 in CAAP-12-0000507
 (SDO). 
As in CAAP-12-0000507, Reyes's arguments here challenge 
the validity of the underlying loan agreements based on the actions and representations of his own loan broker, which he argued constituted fraud and breach of the broker's fiduciary duty to Reyes, and on a number of theories, rendered the loans void or voidable. To the extent that Reyes did not raise in Civ. No. 10-1-0536-03 his claim based on the "undue influence" of his broker in the loan transaction, it should have been raised along with his other claims in his challenge to the validity of the loan in that action, and thus was waived. See, Eastern Sav. 
Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai
'i 154, 160, 296 P.3d 1062, 1068 
(2013) (holding res judicata barred the assertion of federal truth in lending claims in challenging the confirmation of a foreclosure sale when the order of foreclosure was not appealed). Therefore, these arguments, which were waived or raised and finally decided by this court's SDO in CAAP-12-0000507, are barred. 
Based on the foregoing, the (1) November 18, 2013
 
"Order Granting [HSBC's] Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed
 Herein on July 22, 2013;" (2) November 18, 2013 "Judgment on
 Order Granting [HSBC's] Motion for Summary Judgment Filed Herein
 on July 22, 2013, and for Possession;" and (3) November 18, 2013
 "Writ of Possession," entered by the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit, are affirmed.
