ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that Claimant/
 
Appellant/Cross-Appellee/Appellant Raymond V. Rames's (Appellant
 
Rames) appeal from Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's

(the LIRAB)  August 26, 2013 "Attorneys's Fee Approval and Order"
is untimely under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (Supp.

2013), and, thus, we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate
court case number CAAP-13-0006214.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 &
 
Supp. 2013), an aggrieved party may appeal from a final decision
 
and order by the LIRAB directly to the Hawai 'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals:
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.

Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citations and some 
internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The Supreme
 Court of Hawai
'i has "held that an order that finally adjudicates 
a benefit or penalty under the worker's compensation law is an
 appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other
 issues remain." Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104
 
Hawai
'i 164, 168, 86 P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (citation omitted) 
(emphasis added). "Similarly, an order awarding or denying
 attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 386-93(b) determines a
 claimant's rights to those benefits." Id. at 169, 86 P.3d at 978
 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, for example, "[a]n

 "The decision or order of the appellate board shall be final and
conclusive, except as provided in section 386-89, unless within thirty days
after mailing of a certified copy of the decision or order, the director or
any other party appeals to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602, by filing a written notice of appeal with the appellate board, or
by electronically filing a notice of appeal in accordance with the Hawaii
rules of appellate procedure." HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2013) (in relevant part).
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award of attorney's fees and costs, then, is final under the 
Bocalbos rationale for purposes of an appeal." Id. Similarly, an "order denying fees under HRS § 386-94 is also a final order for purposes of appeal in worker compensation cases." Id. 
The August 26, 2013 "Attorneys's Fee Approval and
 
Order" approves a request by Appellant Rames's attorney, Danny J.
 Vasconcellos, for his attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRS
 § 386-94 (Supp. 2013), which, thus, is an appealable order under
 HRS § 386-88, HRS § 91-14(a) and the holding in Lindinha
. 
However, HRS § 386-88 required Appellant Rames to file his notice
 of appeal "within thirty days after mailing of a certified copy
 of the decision or order, . . . in accordance with the Hawaii
 rules of appellate procedure." HRS § 386-88. Appellant Rames
 did not file his December 19, 2013 notice of appeal within thirty
 days after the August 26, 2013 mailing of the August 26, 2013
 "Attorneys's Fee Approval and Order" in violation of the express
 thirty-day time limitation in HRS § 386-88. Therefore, Appellant
 Rames's appeal is untimely. The failure to file a timely notice
 of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
 parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
 the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o
 court or judge or justice is authorized to change the
 jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these
 rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) (“HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
 for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
 occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Absent a timely
 
appeal, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-13-0006214 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that pending motions, if
 
any, in appellate court case number CAAP-13-0006214 are denied as
 moot.
