OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ADELINE N. PORTER, Claimant-Appellant, v.
THE QUEENS MEDICAL CENTER, Employer-Appellee, Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2012-438)
(2-02-15470, 2-02-14441, 2-02-14445, 2-02-15471, 2-10-07337)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Adeline N. Porter (Porter) appeals
 
from the December 3, 2013 "Order" and the December 3, 2013
 
"Decision and Order," both issued by the Labor and Industrial
 Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB).
 
On appeal, Porter contends the LIRAB erred when it 
affirmed a decision from the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability Compensation Division (DCD), which denied 
her request to reopen her workers' compensation case for Multiple 
Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) related injuries that occurred on 
August 9, 2002, August 31, 2002, November 6, 2002, and November 
8, 2002, and on May 13, 2003 (together, injury claims). As best 
as can be determined, Porter also contends the LIRAB erred in not 
reopening her workers' compensation cases because (1) the State of Hawai
'i did not recognize her injury as compensable until 
after her case had concluded and (2) Employer-Appellee, Self-Insured Queen's Medical Center (QMC) engaged in fraudulent 
conduct. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Porter filed claims for workers' compensation benefits
 
on August 1, 2003 and September 19, 2003, alleging that she
 
suffered from work-related MCS injuries on August 9, 2002, August
 31, 2002, November 6, 2002, and November 8, 2002 (collectively,
2002 injuries). On March 19, 2004, the DCD denied Porter's
 
request for compensation for her 2002 injuries because it did not
 
recognize MCS as a compensable injury. On July 19, 2005, LIRAB
 affirmed the DCD's denial of Porter's request for compensation.
 Porter did not pursue judicial review of LIRAB's decision.
1
 
On October 14, 2008, Porter filed a new claim for
 
workers' compensation benefits for an additional MCS injury that
 allegedly occurred on May 13, 2003 (2003 injury) and re-requested
 
compensation for her 2002 injuries. In letters dated October 22,
 
2008 and December 1, 2009, the DCD notified Porter that it was
 unable to process her request for a hearing for her 2002
 injuries. In support of its determination, the DCD's letters
 referred Porter to its March 19, 2004 decision, denying her claim
 for her 2002 injuries, and LIRAB's July 19, 2005 "Decision and
 Order", affirming the DCD's denial (July 19, 2005 D&O).
 
On March 10, 2011, the DCD denied Porter compensation
 
for her 2003 injury claim. In its decision, the DCD determined
 that Porter's 2003 injury was barred under HRS § 386-82 (1993),
2
 
which limits a claimant's period of recovery to "two years after
 
part: 1 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (1993) provides in relevant 
§386-88 Judicial review.  The decision or order of the 
appellate board shall be final and conclusive, except as
provided in section 386-89, unless within thirty days aftermailing of a certified copy of the decision or order, thedirector or any other party appeals to supreme court subjectto chapter 602 by filing a written notice of appeal with theappellate board[.] 
2 HRS § 386-82 provides in relevant part: 
§386-82 Claim for compensation; limitation of time.
The right to compensation under this chapter shall be barredunless a written claim therefor is made to the director of labor and industrial relations (1) within two years afterthe date at which the effects of the injury for which theemployee is entitled to compensation have become manifest,and (2) within five years after the date of the accident oroccurrence which caused the injury. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the date at which the effects of the injury for which the
 
employee is entitled to compensation have become manifest,
 and . . . within five years after the date of the accident or
 occurrence which caused the injury." Porter did not appeal the
 DCD's March 10, 2011 decision to LIRAB.
3
 
On July 30, 2010, while Porter's October 14, 2008
 
request for compensation was still pending, Porter filed yet
 another workers' compensation claim for her 2002 injuries and
 2003 injury. On the same day, Porter sent a letter to the DCD
 requesting that the Director of the DCD (Director) reopen her
 
2002 injury claims that were previously denied in LIRAB's July
 
19, 2005 D&O, pursuant to HRS § 386-89(c) (1993)
4
 (July 30, 2010
Request to Reopen). Porter's July 30, 2010 Request to Reopen
 
stated that "[a]s per the letter of Gary S. Hamada [Administrator
 
of the DCD] dated September 6, 2006 . . . the Department of Labor
 now recognizes Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), as an injury
 which may be compensable." Porter further claimed that "[t]here
 was obviously a mistake in the determination of fact previously
 which precluded [Porter] from pursuing her claim, i.e., that MCS
 was not a physical condition which was recognized as an injury."
 
3 HRS § 386-87(a) (1993) ("Appeals to appellate board.") provides in
relevant part, that "[a] decision of the director shall be final and
conclusive between the parties, except as provided in section 386-89, unless
within twenty days after a copy has been sent to each party, either party
appeals therefrom to the appellate board by filing a written notice of appeal
with the appellate board of the department."
 
4 HRS § 386-89(c) provides in relevant part:
 
§ 386-89 Reopening of cases; continuing jurisdiction
of director. 
. . . .
 
(c) On the application of any party in interest,
supported by a showing of substantial evidence, on the
ground of a change in or of a mistake in a determination of
fact related to the physical condition of the injured
employee, the director may, at any time prior to eight years
after date of the last payment of compensation, whether or
not a decision awarding compensation has been issued, or at
any time prior to eight years after the rejection of a
claim, review a compensation case and issue a decision which
may award, terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or
decrease compensation. No compensation case may be reviewed
oftener than once in six months and no case in which a claim
 has been rejected shall be reviewed more than once if on
such review the claim is again rejected.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In a letter addressed to the DCD and dated March 23,
 
2011, (March 23, 2011 Request to Reopen) Porter claimed that she
 
had not received a response to her July 30, 2010 Request to
 
Reopen and had not received a hearing date for her workers'
 compensation claim dated July 30, 2010. In her letter, Porter
 further alleged that QMC committed fraudulent acts that led the
 DCD to deny her workers' compensation claim for her 2003 injury.
 Specifically, Porter alleged the following:
 
1. Employer concealed "The Report of industrial Accident or
Incident" and the Emergency Room Record of 5/13/03. . . .
 
2. On June 23, 2003, Mr. J. Taylor enclosed in his letter to
Mr. Scott Leong, copies of medical records including
Emergency Room document and Report of Industrial Accident of
5/13/03 . . . .
 
3. On October 1, 2010, in [Mr.Leong's] letter to the
Department of Labor & Industrial Relations, Mr. Leong
wrote, "We are writing to advise you that claimant never
received any treatment for alleged injury on May 13,
2003. . . . Therefore, there are no medical reports related
to the alleged work injury and no record to submit."
 
Porter also alleged that on November 18, 2002, QMC fraudulently
 
requested an extension to complete their investigation by
 misrepresenting facts. Porter requested the DCD reopen her case
 as to her 2003 injury
5
 and penalize QMC under HRS § 386-98(d)
(Supp. 2014).6
 
5 As best as can be determined, Porter relied on HRS § 386-89(b)
(1993) to support reopening her 2003 injury claim. HRS § 386-89(b) provides,
in relevant part, that "[t]he director may at any time, either of the
director's own motion or upon the application of any party, reopen any case on
the ground that fraud has been practiced on the director or on any party and
render such decision as is proper under the circumstances."
 
6	 HRS § 386-98 provides in relevant part:
 
§386-98 Fraud violations and penalties. (a) A
fraudulent insurance act, under this chapter, shall include
acts or omissions committed by any person who intentionally
or knowingly acts or omits to act so as to obtain benefits,
deny benefits, obtain benefits compensation for services
provided, or provides legal assistance or counsel to obtain
benefits or recovery through fraud or deceit by doing the
following:
 
(1)	 Presenting, or causing to be presented, any
false information on an application;
 
(2)	 Presenting, or causing to be presented, any
false or fraudulent claim for the payment of a
loss;
 
(continued...)
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 16, 2011, QMC sent a response to Porter's March
 
23, 2011 Request to Reopen, in which QMC addressed Porter's
 
6(...continued)
(3)	 Presenting multiple claims for the same loss or
injury, including presenting multiple claims to
more than one insurer except when these multiple
claims are appropriate and each insurer is
notified immediately in writing of all other
claims and insurers;
 
(4)	 Making, or causing to be made, any false or
fraudulent claim for payment or denial of a
health care benefit;
 
(5)	 Submitting a claim for a health care benefit
that was not used by, or on behalf of, the
claimant;
 
(6)	 Presenting multiple claims for payment of the
same health care benefit;
 
(7)	 Presenting for payment any undercharges for
health care benefits on behalf of a specific
claimant unless any known overcharges for health
care benefits for that claimant are presented
for reconciliation at that same time;
 
(8)	 Misrepresenting or concealing a material fact;
 
(9)	 Fabricating, altering, concealing, making a
false entry in, or destroying a document;
 
(10)	 Making, or causing to be made, any false or
fraudulent statements with regard to
entitlements or benefits, with the intent to
discourage an injured employee from claiming
benefits or pursuing a workers' compensation
claim; or
 
(11)	 Making, or causing to be made, any false
or fraudulent statements or claims by, or
on behalf of, a client with regard to
obtaining legal recovery or benefits.
 
. . . .
 
(d)	 An offense under subsections (a) and (b) shall
constitute a:
 
(1)	 Class C felony if the value of the moneys
obtained or denied is not less than $2,000;
 
(2)	 Misdemeanor if the value of the moneys obtained
or denied is less than $2,000; or
 
(3)	 Petty misdemeanor if the providing of false
information did not cause any monetary loss.
 
Any person subject to a criminal penalty under this
section shall be ordered by a court to make restitution to
an insurer or any other person for any financial loss
sustained by the insurer or other person caused by the
fraudulent act.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
allegations of fraud as to QMC's October 1, 2010 letter. QMC
 
contended that "[p]erhaps, [its] October 1, 2012 letter was
 unclear. Although there was treatment on May 13, 2003, it was
 considered by [QMC] to be related to one of the four 2002
 claims." QMC maintained that "[b]ecause [QMC] had always
 considered the May 13, 2003 treatment to be part of the 2002
 claims, the October 1, 2010 letter was correct, however, to the
 extent that a new injury of May 13, 2003 was later being claimed,
 the letter could be considered inaccurate but not intentionally
 so."
 
On June 16, 2011, the DCD issued its decision, denying
 
Porter's request as follows:
 
1. Your four cases 2-02-14444 (D/A: 8/9/02), 2-02-14445
(D/A: 8/31/02), 2-02-15471 (D/A: 11/6/02), and 2-02-15470
(D/A: 11/8/02) involving [MCS] were denied on March 19, 2004
by an administrative decision rendered by the [DCD] and
affirmed by the [LIRAB] on July 19, 2005. Since there was
 no appeal of the LIRAB decision dated July 19, 2005, the
ruling became final.
 
2. Your case 2-10-07337 (D/A: 5/13/03) also involving MCS
was denied per administrative decision by the DCD on 3/10/11
as it was not filed timely in accordance with section 386­82, HRS. The decision was not appealed to the LIRAB, and
therefore, the ruling became final.
 
The DCD indicated that it "considered [Porter's] cases closed and
 
therefore, [it] was unable to reopen the cases." The DCD also
 dismissed Porter's fraud complaint without an explanation as to
 the basis of its dismissal.
 
On June 18, 2011, Porter appealed the DCD's dismissal
 
of her injury and fraud claims to LIRAB. On October 28, 2011,
 LIRAB issued its "Order of Remand for Further Proceedings,"
 ordering Porter's case be remanded to the DCD for a hearing and
 decision.
 
On September 27, 2012, the DCD held a hearing on
 
whether QMC committed fraud for any of Porter's workers'
 compensation claims and whether Porter was entitled to reopen her
 claims pursuant to HRS § 386-89 (1993).
 
On November 28, 2012, the DCD issued its decision. In
 
its decision, the DCD denied Porter's request to reopen her
 claims and denied her allegations of fraud, finding that QMC did
 not commit fraud, conceal evidence, or engage in stalling
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
tactics.
 
On December 3, 2012, Porter appealed the DCD's November
 
28, 2012 decision to LIRAB. On April 9, 2013, LIRAB issued a
 
"Pretrial Order" that limited the issues to be determined on
 appeal to the following issues:
 
a.	 Whether Employer committed fraud for any of the August
9, 2002, August 31, 2002, November 6, 2002, November
8, 2002, and May 13, 2003 claims pursuant to Section
386-98, HRS.
 
b.	 Whether Claimant is entitled to reopen her claims for
dates of injuries on August 9, 2002, August 31, 2002,
November 6, 2002, November 8, 2002, and May 13, 2003,
pursuant to Section 386-89, HRS.
 
QMC filed its motion for summary judgment on August 13,
 
2013, in which, QMC argued that Porter failed to appeal LIRAB's
 
July 19, 2005 D&O and the DCD's March 10, 2011 decision and,
 therefore, "[was] prohibited from reopening her cases to re-
litigate her five denied MCS claims." QMC contended that
 "[Porter's] failure to exhaust her administrative remedies
 preclude[d] her from re-litigating the cases and issues via the
 reopening procedure." QMC also argued that it did not commit
 fraud for any of Porter's claims and that, nevertheless, Porter's
 fraud complaint was time-barred, pursuant to HRS § 386-98(f)
 (Supp. 2014).
7
 
On September 17, 2013, LIRAB issued its "Decision and
 
Order," partially granting and partially denying QMC's motion for
 
summary judgment (MSJ D&O). LIRAB agreed with QMC that Porter
 
was not entitled to reopen her injury claims because Porter
 
failed to appeal LIRAB's July 19, 2005 D&O and the DCD's March
 10, 2011 decision. In addition, LIRAB also determined that
 Porter's fraud claims for acts that may have occurred before 2009
 were time-barred, pursuant to HRS § 386-98(f), and that the DCD
 did not exercise its discretion to pursue fraud claims against
 QMC on its own right, so as to warrant reopening her pre-2009
 fraud claims. Thus, LIRAB concluded that Porter was not entitled
 to relief as to her injury and pre-2009 fraud claims. LIRAB
 
7
 HRS § 386-98(f) provides that, "[w]ith respect to the
administrative penalties set forth in subsection (e), no penalty shall be
imposed except upon consideration of a written complaint that specifically
alleges a violation of this section occurring within two years of the date of
said complaint." 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concluded that the only issue that remained was whether QMC's
 
October 1, 2010 letter constituted fraud.
 
On September 30, 2013, Porter filed a "Request for
 
Reconsideration or Appeal" from LIRAB's MSJ D&O (Motion for
 
Reconsideration).
 
On December 3, 2013, LIRAB issued its "Order," denying
 
Porter's Motion for Reconsideration (Reconsideration Order). 
Also on December 3, 2013, LIRAB issued its "Decision and Order"
 
as to whether QMC's October 1, 2010 letter constituted fraud
 (Letter D&O). LIRAB found that "[Porter] did not present clear
 
and convincing evidence that there were intentional or knowing
 
acts or omissions by Employer's counsel to ignore, disregard, or
 violate any of the prohibitions set forth in Section 386-98,
 HRS." LIRAB concluded that "[g]iven that [Porter's] own
 physicians and her own attorneys were not entirely clear that
 treatment sought and rendered before 2008 pertained to a May 13,
 2003 work injury, it would have been unreasonable to expect
 Employer's counsel to know what [Porter's] own physicians and
 attorney apparently did not know prior to the filing of her
 [workers' compensation claim] in 2008." LIRAB ultimately held
 that QMC's October 1, 2010 letter did not constitute fraud and,
 thereby, affirmed the DCD's November 28, 2012 decision, denying
 Porter' request to reopen.
 
On December 23, 2013, Porter filed a timely notice of
 
appeal to this court, appealing LIRAB's Letter D&O. Porter did
 not designate LIRAB's MSJ D&O or Reconsideration Order in her
 notice of appeal. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Appellate review of the LIRAB's decision is governed
by HRS § 91-14(g) (1993), which provides that:
 
Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the
case with instructions for further proceedings;
or it may reverse or modify the decision and
order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions,
or orders are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 (4) Affected by other error of law; or
 (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions are reviewable
under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding
procedural defects are reviewable under subsection (3);
findings are reviewable under subsection (5); and an
agency's exercise of discretion is reviewable under
subsection (6)." Potter v. Hawai' i Newspaper Agency, 89

sufficient grounds to dismiss Porter's appeal. See HRAP Rule 30 
("When the brief of an appellant is otherwise not in conformity 
with these rules, the appeal may be dismissed . . . ."); see also Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995). Nevertheless, given the Hawai 'i Supreme Court's 
ruling in Marvin v. Pflueger, we will address Porter's arguments as best as can be determined. See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 
Hawai
'i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) ("[N]oncompliance with 
Rule 28 does not always result in dismissal of the claims, and [appellate courts have] consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Porter's counsel is warned, however, that future noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28(b) may result in sanctions against him. B. Notice Of Appeal
 
The bulk of Porter's arguments on appeal appear to
 
challenge LIRAB's MSJ D&O, and by extension, LIRAB's
 Reconsideration Order. Together, LIRAB's two orders granted and
 affirmed summary judgment in favor of QMC on Porter's injury
 claims and pre-2009 fraud claim.
 
Porter's notice of appeal failed to designate either
 
order. Instead, Porter designated LIRAB's December 3, 2013
 Letter D&O, which was limited to the issue of whether QMC
 committed fraud by way of its October 1, 2010 letter.
 HRAP Rule 3(c)(2) provides that an appellant's notice
 
of appeal "shall designate the judgment, order, or part thereof

state: (i) the alleged error committed by the court or
agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged error occurred;
and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected

(5) A brief, separate section, entitled "Standard of
Review," setting forth the standard or standards to be

appealed from." See Chun v. Bd. of Trustees of Employees' Ret. 
Sys. of State of Hawaii, 92 Hawai 'i 432, 448, 992 P.2d 127, 143 
(2000) (holding that because the appellants did not designate an 
order in their notices of appeal, the court lacked appellate jurisdiction over the propriety of the order). The designation requirement, however, is not jurisdictional. City & Cnty. Of 
Honolulu v. Midkiff, 57 Haw. 273, 275, 554 P.2d 233, 235 (1976). Thus, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that "a mistake in 
designating the judgment . . . should not result in loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from a specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is not misled by the mistake."•Id. at 275, 554 P.2d at 235; see Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 294, 75 P.3d 1180, 1185 (2003); Munoz v. 
Chandler, 98 Hawai 'i 80, 91, 42 P.3d 657, 668 (App. 2002); State 
v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai 'i 513, 516, 6 P.3d 385, 388 (App. 2000). 
Here, Porter failed to designate LIRAB's
 
Reconsideration Order in her notice of appeal, but still attached
 the order to her notice. Porter's notice of appeal states:
 
Notice is hereby given that [Porter], Claimant-
Appellant, [p]ro se, pursuant to 386-88 HRS, appeals to the
Intermediate Court of Appeals of the State of Hawai' i from 
the Decision and Order of the [LIRAB], filed herein onDecember 3, 2013, and attached hereto as Exhibit "A". 
"Exhibit 'A'" in Porter's notice of appeal includes LIRAB's
 
Reconsideration Order and its Letter D&O, which were both filed
 on December 3, 2013. Given that Porter filed her notice of
 appeal pro se and attached LIRAB's Reconsideration Order and
 Letter D&O as one attachment, it can be fairly inferred that she
 intended to appeal both orders. 
Furthermore, the record contains no indication that 
Porter's designation error misled QMC in any way because QMC's answering brief includes arguments addressing LIRAB's Reconsideration Order. See Graybeard
, 93 Hawai 'i at 516, 6 P.3d 
at 388 (determining that the appellee was not misled by an incorrect designation in the appellant's notice of appeal because the appellee argued as if the appellant had designated the subject judgment). Thus, we hold that we have appellate jurisdiction over Porter's appeal from LIRAB's Reconsideration Order. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Likewise, we also have jurisdiction to review LIRAB's 
MSJ D&O. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that 
a decision by the Director may be appealed to the LIRAB. HRS
§ 386-87 (1993). Further, a "decision or order"• of theLIRAB may be appealed to this court. HRS § 386-88 (1993).HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes judicial review of "a finaldecision and order in a contested case."• Generally, a"final order" is "an order ending the proceedings, leavingnothing further to be accomplished."• Gealon v. Keala, 60Haw. 513, 520, 591 P.2d 621, 626 (1979). However, a finalorder is not necessarily the last decision in a case. In ReHawai'i Gov't Emp. Ass'n. [,Local 152, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, 63
Haw. 85, 88, 621 P.2d 361, 364 (1980)]. "What determines thefinality of an order . . . is the nature and effect of theorder[.]"• Id. 
Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., 104 Hawai 'i 164, 168, 86 
P.3d 973, 977 (2004) (emphasis added and footnotes omitted). In 
addition, "an order that finally adjudicates a benefit or penalty under the workers' compensation law is an appealable final order under HRS § 91-14(a), although other issues remain." Id. (citing 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 89 Hawai
'i 
436, 443, 974 P.2d 1026, 1033 (1999)). 
As indicated in the Pretrial Order, LIRAB was tasked
 
with resolving two issues in Porter's LIRAB appeal: (1) whether
 QMC committed fraud under HRS § 386-98 and (2) whether Porter was
 entitled to reopen her claims for her alleged 2002 and 2003
 injuries under HRS § 386-89. LIRAB's Reconsideration Order and
 Letter D&O were orders that finally adjudicated Porter's workers'
 compensation claims and ended the proceedings before LIRAB with
 nothing further to be accomplished and. See Lindinha, at 168-70,
 
974 P.2d at 977-79. Thus,the Reconsideration Order and Letter
 D&O were the appealable final orders of the LIRAB.
 
"An appeal from a final judgment 'brings up for review 
all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with the issues in the case.'" Ueoka v. Szymanski, 
107 Hawai
'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (quoting Pioneer 
Mill Co. v. Ward, 34 Haw. 686, 694 (1938)). Because LIRAB's Reconsideration Order was the final order of the board, its previous MSJ D&O was an interlocutory order. See Lindinha, 104 
Hawai
'i at 170, 86 P.3d at 979. Therefore, in addition to having 
appellate jurisdiction to review LIRAB's Reconsideration Order, we also have jurisdiction to review LIRAB's MSJ D&O.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
C. LIRAB's September 17, 2013 MSJ D&O
 
On appeal, Porter challenges LIRAB's MSJ D&O and
 
alleges that LIRAB erred in denying her July 30, 2010 Request to
 
Reopen without first addressing whether she satisfied the
 requirements of HRS § 386-89(c).
 
HRS § 386-89(c) provides in part:
 
On the application of any party in interest, supported
by a showing of substantial evidence, on the ground of a
change in or of a mistake in a determination of fact related
to the physical condition of the injured employee, the
director may, at any time prior to eight years after date of
the last payment of compensation, whether or not a decision
awarding compensation has been issued, or at any time prior
to eight years after the rejection of a claim, review a
compensation case and issue a decision which may award,
terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease
compensation.
 
In Porter's July 30, 2010 Request to Reopen, Porter
 
maintained that "[s]ince 2004, there have been scientific
 
research and peer reviewed publications supporting [MCS] as a
 medical disorder." Porter appears to allege that the medical
 community now recognizes MCS as a medical disorder and,
 therefore, there was a change or mistake in LIRAB's July 19, 2005
 determination of fact that warrants reopening her case under HRS
 § 386-89(c).
 
Instead of addressing whether Porter's request to
 
reopen satisfied the requirements of HRS § 386-89, LIRAB's MSJ
 D&O held that Porter was not entitled to reopen her claims for
 her MCS injury claims "because [Porter] did not appeal the final
 Decision and Order of the Board dated July 19, 2005[.]"
9
  
However, such an appeal was not necessary for Porter to reopen
 her case.
 
HRS § 386-88 governs appeals from a LIRAB decision. 
9
 LIRAB's MSJ D&O also acknowledges that Porter failed to appeal the
"final decision of the Director dated March 10, 2011 and the Director did not
reopen the case and pursue allegations of fraud on his own behalf, which
appears to be in reference to Porter's March 23, 2011 Request to Reopen her
2003 injury claim, pursuant to HRS § 386-89(b). HRS § 386-89(b) instructs
that "[t]he director may at any time, either of director's own motion or upon
the application of any party, reopen any case on the ground that fraud has
been practiced on the director or on any party and render such decision as is
proper under the circumstances." (Emphasis added.) Because we hold infra
 that Porter waived her fraud claims on appeal, we focus our analysis on
whether LIRAB erred by not addressing Porter's July 30, 2010 Request to Reopen
her 2002 injury claims based upon a change or mistake of fact under HRS § 386­89(c).
 
13
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 386-88 specifically provides that if a claimant does not 
appeal LIRAB's decision within 30 days, "[t]he decision or order . . . shall be final and conclusive, except as provided by section 386-89[.]" (Emphasis added.) Thus, a claimant can seek to reopen their workers' compensation case under HRS § 386-89, even if they did not appeal LIRAB's original decision, so as long as the requirements of HRS § 386-89 are met. See HRS § 386-88; 
see also McLaren v. Paradise Inn Hawaii LLC, 132 Hawai
'i 320, 
328-29, 321 P.3d 671, 679-80 (2014) (citing Alvarez v. Liberty House, Inc., 85 Hawai
'i 275, 278, 942 P.2d 539, 543 (1997) 
(holding that "the twenty-day time limitation to appeal does not commence until the [Director of Labor and Industrial Relations'] formally denies an HRS § 386-89 motion")). Accordingly, LIRAB erred in denying Porter's July 30, 2010 Request to Reopen her 2002 injury claims without first addressing whether her request satisfied the requirements of HRS § 386-89(c). D. LIRAB's December 3, 2013 Letter D&O
 
On appeal, Porter also challenges LIRAB's determination
 
that QMC did not commit fraud. Instead of formulating an
 argument in support of Porter's fraud appeal, however, Porter's
 
opening brief contends that "[t]he issue of fraud in this case
 
has been argued very well by [Porter] and her arguments are in
 the exhibits. [Porter] would rely on the arguments made in her
 Memoranda and exhibits, instead of repeating all of those
 arguments to the court."
 
If we accept Porter's previously filed memoranda as 
support for her fraud argument, and thus part of her opening brief, Porter would be in violation of HRAP Rule 28(a), which provides that "an opening . . . brief shall not exceed 35 pages[.]" See Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai
'i 202, 221, 159 P.3d 
814, 833 (2007) (waiving points of error where appellant failed to present an argument and, instead, directed the court to previously filed memoranda). 
Inasmuch as Porter's opening brief does not include a
 
fraud argument and only directs this court to her previously
 filed memoranda and exhibits, we deem this point of error waived. 
See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (stating that an opening brief should
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contain "[t]he argument, containing the contentions of the
 
appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with
 citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record
 relied on. . . . Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We vacate the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 
Board's December 3, 2013 "Order," and September 17, 2013
 "Decision and Order," as it pertains to requests to reopen claims
 under HRS § 386-89(c). We remand the issue of reopening Porter's
 claims under HRS § 386-89(c) to the Labor and Industrial
 Relations Appeals Board for further proceedings consistent with
 this opinion. 
The December 3, 2013 "Decision and Order" of the Labor
 
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board is affirmed.
