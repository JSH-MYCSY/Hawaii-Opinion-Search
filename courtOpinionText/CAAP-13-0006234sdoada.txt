IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CORAZON D. CONSTANTINO, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 10-1-0206)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard and Ginoza, JJ. with

Nakamura, C.J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Corazon D. Constantino

 
(Constantino) appeals from an "Amended Judgment; Guilty
 
Conviction and Probation Sentence, Notice of Entry" (Amended
 Judgment) filed on October 31, 2013, in the Circuit Court of the
 Fifth Circuit (circuit court).
1
 
An Indictment filed on July 22, 2010 charged
 
Constantino with three Counts: two counts of Sexual Assault in
 the Third Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 707-732(1)(b) (2014) (Counts 1 and 2); and one count of
 Attempted Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of
 HRS §§ 705-500 (2014) and 707-732(1)(b) (Count 3). 
On December 14, 2010, Constantino filed a Motion to
 
Dismiss (Defective Charge Motion) alleging that the Indictment
 was defective for failing to allege all elements of the charges,

specifically that it failed to allege that Constantino was not
 
married to the complaining witness (CW), a minor. The circuit
 court denied the motion.
 
On February 28, 2011, Constantino also filed a Motion 
to Dismiss for Lack of Probable Cause on grounds that Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) failed to present evidence of 
probable cause to the grand jury to support the Indictment, particularly that Constantino was not married to the CW. The circuit court denied the motion. 
On January 22, 2013, Constantino filed a motion to
 
reconsider the order denying the Defective Charge Motion (Motion
 to Reconsider), again challenging the Indictment as being
 defective for failing to allege that Constantino was not married
 to the CW. The circuit court issued an order on February 7, 2013
 denying the motion.
 
Subsequently, on March 6, 2013, pursuant to a plea
 
agreement, Constantino pled no-contest to an amended Count 1 -­Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of HRS
 § 707-732(1)(f) (2014) -- in return for the State dismissing
 Counts 2 and 3 with prejudice. 
Constantino thereafter sought to withdraw his no-
contest plea, but his motion in this regard was denied by the
 circuit court. The Amended Judgment was subsequently entered
 against Constantino pursuant to his no-contest plea, convicting
 him of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree in violation of HRS
 § 707-732(1)(f).

2 Pursuant to the plea agreement, the parties agreed that Constantino
would plead to the amended offense under HRS § 707-732(1)(f) rather than the
charged offense under HRS § 707-732(1)(b). HRS § 707-732(1)(b) and (f)
provide in relevant part:
 
§707-732 Sexual assault in the third degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of sexual assault in the third degree if:
 
. . . .
 
(b) The person knowingly subjects to sexual contact
another person who is less than fourteen years old or

On appeal, Constantino's points of error assert that
 
the circuit court erred in: (1) denying his motions for
 
dismissal; and (2) denying his motion to withdraw no-contest
 plea. 
The State concedes that, in light of this court's 
ruling in State v. Muller, No. CAAP-10-0000225, 2014 WL 444230, 131 Hawai
'i 331, 318 P.3d 621 (App. Jan. 31, 2014) (SDO), cert. 
denied, No. SCWC-10-0000225, 2014 WL 1758391 (Haw. Apr. 29, 2014), the Indictment was insufficient, the Amended Judgment should be vacated, and the case dismissed without prejudice. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that the
 State's concession of error is appropriate, that Constantino's
 conviction must be vacated, and the case must be remanded for
 dismissal without prejudice.
 
"The issue of whether a complaint provides sufficient 
notice to a defendant is reviewed under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard." State v. Codiamat, 131 Hawai
'i 220, 223, 
317 P.3d 664, 667 (2013). 
2(...continued)
causes such a person to have sexual contact with the

person;
 
. . . .
 
(f)	 The person knowingly, by strong compulsion, has sexual
contact with another person or causes another person
to have sexual contact with the actor.
 
(Emphasis added.) In turn, "sexual contact" is defined in HRS § 707-700 (2014)
as: 
any touching, other than acts of "sexual penetration", of the
sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the
actor, or of the sexual or other intimate parts of the actor by
the person, whether directly or through the clothing or other
material intended to cover the sexual or other intimate parts. 
(Emphasis added.)

As this court held in Muller,
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has set out the four material
elements of the offense of sexual assault in the third 
degree under HRS § 707–732(1)(b), one of which is "that thedefendant was aware that the Minor was not married to him (i.e., the requisite knowing state of mind with respect tothe attendant circumstance implicit in 'sexual contact,'
...).". State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 15, 928 P.2d 843, 857
(1996). Therefore, Count II [alleging Sexual Assault in the
Third Degree in violation of HRS § 707–732(1)(b)] should
have alleged that Muller was aware that the complainant was
not married to him. 
Muller, 2014 WL 444230 at *1 (original brackets omitted).
 
Here, Constantino filed motions in the circuit court
 
asserting that the Indictment was deficient for failing to allege
 
that Constantino was not married to the CW. Consistent with
 Muller, we conclude that because the counts in the Indictment -­all of which involved HRS § 707-732(1)(b) -- failed to allege the
 essential element that Constantino was aware that the CW was not
 married to him, the Indictment was deficient. Constantino's
 conviction must be vacated and the case dismissed without
 prejudice. We need not reach Constantino's second point of
 error.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Amended Judgment; Guilty
 
Conviction and Probation Sentence, Notice of Entry" filed by the
 Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit on October 31, 2013, is
 vacated. The case is remanded to the circuit court with
 instructions to dismiss the case without prejudice.
