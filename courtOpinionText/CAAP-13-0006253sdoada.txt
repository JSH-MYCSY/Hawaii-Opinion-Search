v.
 
EDWARD W. AYAU, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 12-1-0031)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Edward W. Ayau (Ayau) appeals from
 
a Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment), entered
 
November 4, 2013, in the Family Court of the First Circuit1
 
(family court). Judgment was entered against Ayau on four (4)
 
2
counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree  in violation of
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-732(1)(b) (2014).3 Ayau was
 
1 The Honorable Michael D. Wilson presided.
 
2 Ayau was indicted on six (6) counts of Sexual Assault in the Third
Degree, however, the family court granted Ayau's motion for judgment of
acquittal on two of the counts at the close of the State's case. 
3
 HRS § 707-732(1)(b) provides:
 
§707-732 Sexual assault in the third degree. (1) A
person commits the offense of sexual assault in the third
degree if:
 
. . . .
 
(b)	 The person knowingly subjects to sexual contact
another person who is less than fourteen years
old or causes such a person to have sexual
contact with the person[.]

convicted of sexually assaulting Minor 1 and Minor 2, ages 13 and
 
11, respectively, at the time of trial. 
On appeal, Ayau asserts the family court (1) abused its
 
discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial after Minor 2
 broke down crying on the stand and failed to complete her
 testimony; (2) plainly erred in denying his motion for a mistrial
 given allegedly egregious prosecutorial misconduct related to
 Minor 2; (3) plainly erred by failing to inquire into Ayau's
 hearing difficulties, which deprived Ayau of meaningful
 participation in the trial; and (4) erred by finding that Ayau's
 post-arrest statement to police was voluntary under the totality
 of the circumstances.
 
In its answering brief, Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai
'i (State) points out that the indictment is deficient 
because all six (6) counts of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree failed to allege that Ayau was aware that he was not married to the minors, which is an attendant circumstance of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree and should have been included in the charges. State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai
'i 1, 15, 928 P.2d 843, 857 (1996); State 
v. Muller, CAAP-10-0000225, 2014 WL 444230, 131 Hawai 'i 331, 318 
P.3d 621, at *1 (App. Jan. 31, 2014) (SDO), cert denied 2014 WL 1758391. The State asks this court to adopt a standard requiring Ayau to show prejudice as a result of the deficient charges; however, as the State recognizes, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has 
dismissed deficient charges without prejudice, even when an appellant did not raise the issue on appeal. See State v. 
Armitage, 132 Hawai
'i 36, 49, 319 P.3d 1044, 1057 (2014). 
Ayau contends we still must address his arguments on
 
appeal as his points of error raise issues that may bar
 reprosecution on double jeopardy grounds. We agree that Ayau's
 assertion of prosecutorial misconduct potentially raises double
 jeopardy considerations and we will therefore address that point
 of error. We need not address Ayau's other points of error. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we vacate the
 Judgment, conclude that reprosecution is not barred, and remand
 to the family court with instructions to dismiss without
 prejudice the four (4) counts of which Ayau was convicted.

Ayau's claim of Prosecutorial Misconduct  Ayau contends
 
the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (DPA) committed egregious
 misconduct by purposefully calling Minor 2 to testify, even
 though the DPA allegedly knew Minor 2 would not be able to
 complete her testimony without crying, and in addition, the DPA
 made improper reference to Minor 2's stricken testimony during
 closing argument.
5 Ayau asserts both of these arguments for the
 
first time on appeal.
 
If defense counsel does not object at trial to
prosecutorial misconduct, [the appellate court] maynevertheless recognize such misconduct if plainlyerroneous. "We may recognize plain error when theerror committed affects substantial rights of thedefendant." State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 405,
56 P.3d 692, 707 (2002) (citations and internalquotation marks omitted). See also Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure . . . Rule 52(b) (2003) ("Plain errorsor defects affecting substantial rights may be noticedalthough they were not brought to the attention of thecourt."). We will not overturn a defendant's conviction on the basis of plainly erroneousprosecutorial misconduct, however, unless "there is areasonable possibility that the misconduct complainedof might have contributed to the conviction." State 
v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 1238
(1999). 
4 The State may not reassert the two charges that were dismissed.
State v. Lee, 91 Hawai' i 206, 210, 982 P.2d 340, 344 (1999) ("Any acquittal
. . . implicates the double jeopardy clause, so long as it is based upon a
finding that the evidence is insufficient to convict.").
5 Ayau frames this point of error as follows:
 
The circuit court abused its discretion by denying
Mr. Ayau's motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor
committed egregious misconduct by calling one of the young
complaining witnesses in order to elicit an emotional
response and then improperly referring to her stricken
"testimony" during closing argument.
 
Although Ayau admits that he did not raise prosecutorial misconduct in support
of his motion for a mistrial, he asks us to recognize prosecutorial misconduct
as plain error and asserts that the prosecutorial misconduct was so egregious
as to bar reprosecution. We therefore review accordingly.

State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513, 78 P.3d 317, 326
(2003). "[T]he decision to take notice of plain error must
turn on the facts of the particular case to correct errorsthat 'seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or publicreputation of judicial proceedings.'" State v. Fox, 70 Haw.
46, 56, 760 P.2d 670, 676 (1988) (quoting United States v.Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S. Ct. 391, 80 L. Ed. 555(1936)). Nevertheless, [the appellate] court's "'power todeal with plain error is one to be exercised sparingly andwith caution because the plain error rule represents adeparture from a presupposition of the adversary system-­that a party must look to his or her counsel for protectionand bear the cost of counsel's mistakes.'" State v. Aplaca, 
96 Hawai' i 17, 22, 25 P.3d 792, 797 (2001) (quoting State v.
Kelekolio, 74 Haw. 479, 515, 849 P.2d 58, 74-75 (1993)). 
State v. Rodrigues, 113 Hawai 'i 41, 47, 147 P.3d 825, 831 (2006). 
Thus, because Ayau alleges prosecutorial misconduct for 
the first time on appeal, "we must determine whether the 
prosecutor's comment was improper and, if so, whether such misconduct constituted plain error that affected [Ayau's] substantial rights." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai
'i 289, 304, 926 
P.2d 194, 209 (1996). If the DPA's conduct was improper and plain error, we must then decide if the misconduct was so egregious as to bar reprosecution. See State v. Rogan, 91 
Hawai
'i 405, 416, 984 P.2d 1231, 1242 (1999).
a) Calling Minor 2 to Testify  Ayau contends that the

 
DPA called Minor 2 to testify knowing that Minor 2 would not be
 able to complete her testimony. The record does not establish
 that the DPA improperly called Minor 2 to testify at trial.
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court "has reiterated the view 
that: The prosecution has a duty to seek justice, to exercise the highest good faith in the interest of the public and to avoid even the appearance of unfair advantage over the accused." State 
v. Basham, 132 Hawai
'i 97, 118, 319 P.3d 1105, 1126 (2014) 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). An attempt to persuade a jury through deceptive or reprehensible methods is considered to be prosecutorial misconduct. State v. 
Palabay, 9 Haw. App. 414, 429, 844 P.2d 1, 9 (1992) (citation omitted). 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Ayau's argument is based on a series of inferences.6
 
However, the circumstantial evidence cited by Ayau and a review
 
of the record as a whole does not demonstrate the DPA acted
 improperly in calling Minor 2 as a witness. First, the DPA's
 representations to the court indicate her belief that Minor 2
 would be able to testify. Second, the DPA referenced the
 potential testimony of both Minor 1 and Minor 2 during opening
 statements. Third, the DPA's attempt to continue questioning
 Minor 2 once she began crying was not extensive and was
 understandable given the need for Minor 2's testimony to support
 the three counts alleging that Ayau abused her, a need
 underscored by the subsequent dismissal of two of the counts for
 lack of evidence. Lastly, the State's focus on a "single
 witness" was logical considering that the only eye witnesses were
 the two minors themselves, and that neither could testify
 completely to the alleged assault of the other. We thus conclude
 that the record does not establish misconduct by the DPA in
 calling Minor 2 as a witness.
b)
 Closing Argument  Ayau further asserts that the DPA

 
committed misconduct by allegedly referencing Minor 2's crying
 during closing argument, when the DPA stated: "When a child's
 voice is hard to hear[,] one must try to listen. And when a
 child's cry is confusing, one must try to understand." The State
 does not address this alleged misconduct in its answering brief.
 
Given the record, it appears reasonably possible that 
the DPA's reference to "a child's cry" was, or could be interpreted by the jury as, a reference to Minor 2's testimony, which was stricken by the court. 
Assuming that was the case, it 
would be improper. See State v. Yip, 92 Hawai 'i 98, 111, 987

 Ayau contends the State emphasized throughout trial that the jury
could convict Ayau based on the testimony of a single witness, despite there
being two complaining witnesses; Ayau contends that the State only referenced
Minor 1's testimony during opening statements; and Ayau contends the State
continued to ask Minor 2 questions after she already started to cry, delaying
the family court from calling a recess, quickly and adamantly declared that
Minor 2 would not be able to testify anytime soon, and immediately suggested
that the court strike her testimony.

P.2d 996, 1009 (App. 1999) ("In closing arguments, it is improper
 
to refer to evidence which is not in the record or has been
 excluded by the court."). 
However, even assuming that the DPA's closing argument 
was improper, it was not so egregious as to merit a bar to reprosecution. "[U]nder the double jeopardy clause of article 1, section 10 of the Hawai
'i Constitution, [ ] reprosecution of a 
defendant after a mistrial or reversal on appeal as a result of prosecutorial misconduct is barred where the prosecutorial misconduct is so egregious that, from an objective standpoint, it clearly denied a defendant his or her right to a fair trial." Rogan, 91 Hawai
'i at 423, 984 P.2d at 1249. "Double jeopardy 
principles will bar reprosecution that is caused by prosecutorial misconduct only where there is a highly prejudicial error affecting a defendant's right to a fair trial and will be applied only in exceptional circumstances . . . ." Id. at 423 n.11, 984 
P.2d at 1249 n.11. 
This is not the type of exceptional circumstance 
described in Rogan. See Rogan, 91 Hawai
'i at 424, 984 P.2d at 
1250 (holding that the prosecution's appeal to racial prejudice that had no objectively legitimate purpose was egregious and barred reprosecution). The DPA's alleged reference to Minor 2's crying amounts to a reference to material that was excluded by the court and arguably a plea to the jury's passion or pity. However, from an objective standpoint and because it was a brief comment during closing argument, the reference was not so egregious that it clearly denied Ayau his right to a fair trial. While we question the DPA's reference to "a child's cry" in this instance, we do not believe it is comparable to the misconduct in Rogan. See also State v. Espiritu, 117 Hawai
'i 127, 144, 176 
P.3d 885, 902 (2008) (holding that the prosecution's misstatement of the law was not egregious from an objective standpoint); State v. Pacheco, 96 Hawai
'i 83, 98, 26 P.3d 572, 587 (2001) (holding 
that the prosecution's disregard of the trial court's in limine ruling and reference to the defendant as an "asshole" did not

amount to exceptional circumstances barring reprosecution); State
 
v. Shabazz, 98 Hawai 'i 358, 382-83, 48 P.3d 605, 629-30 (App. 
2002) (holding that the prosecution's reference to race without a legitimate purpose was misconduct but was not so egregious as to bar reprosecution). We thus conclude that reprosecution is not barred. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence, entered on November 4, 2013, in the
 Family Court of the First Circuit is vacated and this case is
 remanded with instructions to dismiss without prejudice the four
 (4)
 counts of which Ayau was convicted.
