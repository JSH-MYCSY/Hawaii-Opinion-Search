IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LYNN GORDON WATERHOUSE, Defendant-Appellant,
and ADRIENNE VICENTE, Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-1818)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lynn Gordon Waterhouse (Waterhouse)
 
appeals from a November 27, 2013 Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court) Judgment of Conviction and Sentence.1
 
Waterhouse was convicted of Robbery in the Second Degree in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-841(1)(b) (Supp.
 
2012) and sentenced to ten years imprisonment with a mandatory
 
minimum of ten years as a repeat offender. On appeal, Waterhouse
 contends that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support
 his conviction of Robbery in the Second Degree; (2) the Circuit
 Court's failure to instruct the jury that "defense of others" is
 a defense to Robbery in the Second Degree denied him his right to
 a fair trial; and (3) the Circuit Court's failure to instruct the
 jury on the included offense of Theft in the Fourth Degree denied
 him his right to a fair trial.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Waterhouse's points of error as follows:
 
(1) 	The State charged Waterhouse with Robbery in the
 
First Degree in violation of HRS § 708-840(1)(b)(ii) (1993 &
 
2
Supp. 2012),  which provides, in relevant part:
§ 708-840 Robbery in the first degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of robbery in the first degree if, in
the course of committing theft or non-consensual taking of a
motor vehicle:
 
. . . . 
(b) 	The person is armed with a dangerous instrument
and:
 . . . . 
(ii) 	The person threatens the imminent use of
force against the person of anyone present
with intent to compel acquiescence to the
taking of or escaping with the property;
. . . . 
(2) As used in this section, "Dangerous instrument"
means any firearm, whether loaded or not, and whether
operable or not, or other weapon, device, instrument,
material, or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which
 in the manner it is used or threatened to be used is capable
of producing death or serious bodily injury.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The jury found Waterhouse guilty of the lesser included
offense of Robbery in the Second Degree in violation of HRS
 
§ 708-841, which provides, in relevant part:
 
 
§ 708-841 Robbery in the second degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of robbery in the second degree if, in
the course of committing theft or non-consensual taking of a
motor vehicle:
 
. . . . 

(b)
	 The person threatens the imminent use of force
against the person of anyone who is present with
intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of
or escaping with the property[.]
 
Waterhouse argues that there was a lack of substantial
 
evidence to support the "threat of force" element of the robbery
 
charge, because the only threat of force occurred when, according
 to the complaining witness, Daniel Dabin (Dabin), Waterhouse
 
swung at and threatened to cut Dabin with a knife. Specifically,
 
2
 Subsequent to the date of Waterhouse's alleged offense, the cited
portions HRS § 708-840 were amended to add references to a "simulated
firearm."

Waterhouse argues that because the jury did not find him guilty
 
of Robbery in the First Degree,
 
they did not feel that the State proved the threat of force
with a dangerous instrument element beyond a reasonable
doubt. However, based upon the evidence adduced at trial,
because the only threats of force allegedly occurred with
the knife, there is no legal way for the jury to have found
that Lynn committed the offense of Robbery in the Second
Degree without committing the offense of Robbery in the
First Degree.
 
As the State argues, however, this theory overlooks the
 
possibility that the jury concluded that, while the State had
 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Waterhouse threatened the
 imminent use of force, it failed to prove that he was "armed with
 a dangerous instrument" as required for a conviction of Robbery
 in the First Degree under HRS § 708-840(1)(b). The jury could
 have found that Waterhouse threatened the imminent use of force,
 but was not armed with a "weapon . . ., which in the manner it is
 used or threatened to be used is capable of producing death or
 serious bodily injury," when he did so. See HRS § 708-840(2). 
Here, the complaining witness testified that Waterhouse
 threatened him while brandishing an old folding knife that was
 about three inches long, including both the handle and the blade. 
The police officer who responded to the incident did not find a
 knife on Waterhouse's person when he patted him down, but the
 officer also testified that he did not look around the area for
 one.
 
In his Reply Brief, Waterhouse argues that 
the "threat of force" being offered as a basis for the
Robbery in the Second Degree conviction is intimately tiedto [Dabin's] allegation that [Waterhouse] was alsobrandishing a knife. Without the knife, which is a findingby the fact-finder we must adhere to, there is no "truethreat" as required by 
State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai' i 465, 24
P.3d 661 (2001). The jury specifically found the evidenceinsufficient as to the knife and the threats associated with the knife. There were no other verbal threats of force used by [Waterhouse]. There was no threat to otherwise harm the complainant physically. 
However, the "true threat" distinction drawn in
 
Valdivia referred to a first degree terroristic threatening
 
charge under HRS §§ 707-715 and 707-716(1)(c), and addressed the
 defendant's assertion that his remarks were constitutionally
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
protected speech. See State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai 'i 465, 474, 24 
P.3d 661, 670 (2001). The requisite intent under the terroristic
 
threatening statutes is also different from that required under
 HRS § 708-841.
3 No Hawai 'i case has extended the "true threat" 
requirement to apply to robbery and we decline to do so here. 
Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
 
to the State, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's
 conclusion that Waterhouse, "in the course of committing
 theft[,]" "threaten[ed] the imminent use of force against [Dabin]
 with intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping
 
3 "Terroristic Threatening" is defined in HRS § 707-715 (2014),
which provides:
 
§ 707-715 Terroristic threatening, defined. A person
commits the offense of terroristic threatening if the person
threatens, by word or conduct, to cause bodily injury to
another person or serious damage or harm to property,
including the pets or livestock, of another or to commit a
felony:
(1)	 With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless
disregard of the risk of terrorizing, another
person; or
(2)	 With intent to cause, or in reckless disregard
of the risk of causing evacuation of a building,
place of assembly, or facility of public
transportation.
 
(Emphasis added). In contrast, HRS § 708-840 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 708-840 Robbery in the first degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of robbery in the first degree if, in
the course of committing theft or non-consensual taking of a
motor vehicle:
 
. . . .
 (b)	 
The person is armed with a dangerous instrument

and:
 
. . . .
 (ii) 
	The person threatens the imminent use of
force against the person of anyone present
with intent to compel acquiescence to the
taking of or escaping with the property[.]
 
(Emphasis added). Similarly, HRS § 708-841 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 708-841 Robbery in the second degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of robbery in the second degree if, in
the course of committing theft or non-consensual taking of a
motor vehicle:
 
. . . .
 (b) 	The person threatens the imminent use of force
against the person of anyone who is present with
 intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of
or escaping with the property[.]
 
(Emphasis added).

with the property" and was thus guilty of Robbery in the Second
 
Degree under HRS § 708-841(b).
 
(2) Waterhouse argues, in essence, that the Circuit
 
Court plainly erred when it failed to specifically instruct the

 
jury that "defense of others" is a defense to Robbery in the
 Second Degree and thus denied him his right to a fair trial. 
Waterhouse requested only that a "defense of others" instruction
 be given as to the Robbery in the First Degree charge. 
Waterhouse's trial counsel also did not object to the Circuit
 Court's omission of a "defense of others" instruction as to
 Robbery in the Second Degree.
 
The supreme court discussed the standard of review for
 
allegedly erroneous omissions of jury instructions that were not
 requested at trial in State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai
'i 327, 141 P.3d 
974 (2006). The supreme court has since clarified the Nichols
 framework in State v. Taylor, in the context of the omission of a
 "mistake of fact" instruction that was not requested at trial:
 
We reiterate that it is the trial court's duty to
properly instruct the jury. However, in the case of a jury
instruction that is not requested at trial, the omission of
which is later denominated as error for the first time on
 appeal, the Nichols' "merger" holding should also be
clarified.

 
Upon further examination of this case, it appears that
the Nichols court, despite its "merger" holding, continued
to engage in a two-step, plain-error-then-harmless error

review in analyzing instructional error. Nichols observed
 
that the defendant must first overcome the presumption that
the instructions as given were correct. 111 Hawai' i at 337 
n.6, 141 P.3d at 984 n.6. Once instructional error is
 demonstrated, the defendant must then show that there was a
reasonable possibility that the erroneous jury instruction
contributed to his or her conviction, i.e., that the
instructional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt. See 111 Hawai' i at 337, 141 P.3d at 984. 
The first step in the Nichols analysis was our
determination that "the circuit court's failure to give a

'relevant attributes' instruction was plain error[.]" 111
 Hawai'i at 338, 141 P.3d at 985 (emphasis added). This was 
so because under State v. Valdivia, the failure to instruct
on relevant attributes in a terroristic threatening case is
reversible error in any event, whether or not the relevant
attributes instruction is requested (as it was in Valdivia)
or unrequested (as it was in Nichols). 95 Hawai' i 465, 479,
24 P.3d 661, 675 (2001) (concluding that the omission of an
instruction on relevant attributes was error because "the
 jury . . . should have been instructed that it could
consider relevant attributes of both the defendant and the
 [complaining witness] in determining whether the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[complaining witness's] fear of bodily injury . . . was
objectively reasonable under the circumstances. . . .")[.]
 
The next step in the Nichols analysis was our
determination that "there is a reasonable possibility that
the error contributed to Nichols' conviction, i.e., the
error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." 111
 Hawai'i at 338, 141 P.3d at 985 (emphasis added). Thus, it
would appear that, rather than "merging" the two standards
of review, the Nichols court retained the two-step
plain-error-then-harmless-error inquiry.
 
Thus, in the case of a mistake of fact jury
instruction that is not requested and not given at trial,
the omission of which is denominated as error for the first
 time on appeal, we clarify that the plain error standard
continues to apply. Plain error exists "[i]f the
substantial rights of the defendant have been affected
adversely[.]" 
State v. Kikuta , 125 Hawai' i 78, 95, 253 P.3d
639, 656 (2011). This court "will apply the plain error
standard of review to correct errors [that] seriously affect
the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial
proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to prevent
the denial of fundamental rights." Id. (citations omitted).
 
In the case of a jury instruction on mistake of fact
that is not requested by the defense and not given by the
trial court, plain error affecting substantial rights exists
if the defendant had met his or her initial burden at trial
 of adducing credible evidence of facts constituting the
defense (or those facts are supplied by the prosecution's
witnesses). 
See Stenger , 122 Hawai' i at 280, 226 P.3d at
450 (citing Locquiao, 100 Hawai' i at 206, 58 P.3d at 1253
and the Commentary to HRS § 701–115). See id.
 
State v. Taylor, 130 Hawai 'i 196, 204-05, 307 P.3d 1142, 1150-51 
(2013) (bold emphases added, footnote omitted). The court
 
further clarified the burden-shifting under Nichols in State v.
 DeLeon:
 
[T]he appellant must first demonstrate instructional
error by rebutting the "presumption that unobjected-to jury
instructions are correct." If the appellant is able to
rebut this presumption, the burden shifts to the State to
prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt. . . . 

If the State cannot demonstrate that the error was
 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction must be
vacated. 
. . . .
 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b)
states that "[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial
rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the
attention of the court." Therefore, an appellate court "may
recognize plain error when the error committed affects
substantial rights of the defendant."

State v. DeLeon, 131 Hawai 'i 463, 479-80, 319 P.3d 382, 398-99 
(2014) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted; format 
altered). 
Here, Waterhouse argues that it was plain error for the
 
Circuit Court to omit a specific instruction that "defense of
 others" is a defense to Robbery in the Second Degree, and that
 this court should vacate his conviction under the Nichols
 framework. We first analyze whether the Circuit Court's failure
 to give a "defense of others" instruction as to Robbery in the
 Second Degree was incorrect. 
Waterhouse was charged with Robbery in the First Degree
 
under HRS § 708-840(1)(b)(ii) but convicted of Robbery in the
 Second Degree under HRS § 708-841(1)(b). The applicable sub­sections in both statutes require that the defendant, "in the
 course of committing theft[,]" "threatens the imminent use of
 force against the person of anyone [who is] present with intent
 to compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with the
 property[.]" See HRS §§ 708-840(1), (1)(b)(ii) and 708-841(1),
 
(1)(b). There is no difference in the state of mind required for
 these identical elements of each offense. The only element that
 differs between the two offenses is the requirement under HRS
 § 708-840(1)(b) that the defendant be "armed with a dangerous
 instrument" in order to commit Robbery in the First Degree.
 
After giving an instruction on the charge of Robbery in
 
the First Degree, the Circuit Court instructed the jury that it
 must consider the lesser included offense of Robbery in the
 Second Degree if and only if it found Waterhouse not guilty of
 the charged offense or was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. 
Immediately following that instruction, the Circuit Court also
 instructed that "defense of others" is a defense to Robbery in
 the First Degree:
 
If and only if you find the defendant not guilty of
Robbery in the First Degree, or you are unable to reach a
unanimous verdict as to this offense, then you must consider
whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the
included offense of Robbery in the Second Degree.
 
A person commits the offense of Robbery in the Second
Degree if, in the course of committing theft, he threatens
the imminent use of force against the person of anyone who
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is present, with intent to compel acquiescence to the taking
of or escaping with the property. 
There are two material elements of the offense of
 
Robbery in the Second Degree, each of which the prosecution
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 
These two elements are: 
1. That, on or about November 28th, 2012, in the City
and County of Honolulu, the defendant, Lynn Gordon
Waterhouse, was in the course of committing theft; and
2. That, while doing so, the defendant, Lynn Gordon
Waterhouse, intentionally threatened the imminent use of
force against the person of anyone who was present, with
intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping
with the property.
 
A person commits theft if he obtains or excerpts [sic]
unauthorized control over the property of another with
intent to deprive the person of the property.
 
An act shall be deemed 'in the course of committing a
theft' if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft, in the
commission of a theft, or in the flight after the attempt or
commission.
 
Defense of others is a defense to the charge of
Robbery in the First Degree. The burden is on the
 
 
prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
force used by the defendant was not justifiable. If the
 prosecution does not meet its burden, then you must find the
defendant not guilty. 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The State argues that
 
the jury could have rationally understood the instruction to
apply to both the charge of Robbery in the First Degree and
Robbery in the Second Degree as the "defense of others"
instruction immediately followed the reading of both
offenses, rather than immediately following only the charge
of Robbery in the First Degree. 
However,
 
[The Hawai' i supreme] court has stated that "[t]he due
process guarantee of the . . . Hawaii constitution [ ]
serves to protect the right of an accused in a criminal case
to a fundamentally fair trial." 
State v. Kaulia , 128
 
Hawai'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (quoting State v.
Matafeo, 71 Haw. 183, 185, 787 P.2d 671, 672 (1990)).
"Central to the protections of due process is the right to
be accorded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete
defense." Id. (quoting Matafeo, 71 Haw. at 185, 787 P.2d at
 
672).
 
DeLeon, 131 Hawai 'i at 485-86, 319 P.3d at 404-05. 
Where a defendant does not request a jury instruction
 
on a particular defense, Taylor holds that the failure to
 
8
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
instruct on the defense is only plain error if the defendant
 
adduces credible evidence of facts constituting the defense:
 
In the case of a jury instruction on mistake of fact that is
not requested by the defense and not given by the trial
court, plain error affecting substantial rights exists if
the defendant had met his or her initial burden at trial of
 adducing credible evidence of facts constituting the defense
(or those facts are supplied by the prosecution's
witnesses). 
Taylor, 130 Hawai 'i at 205, 307 P.3d at 1151(footnote omitted). 
Waterhouse's entire theory of defense against the
 
robbery charge was that he acted to protect the woman who was
 
with him from Dabin rather than "to compel acquiescence to the
 taking of or escaping with the property." We conclude that there
 was credible evidence adduced at trial to support a claim of
 self-defense as to the lesser included offense of Robbery in the
 Second Degree. Because the Circuit Court did not expressly
 instruct the jury that "defense of others" also applies to
 Robbery in the Second Degree, Waterhouse was unable to present a
 complete defense to that offense. Thus, the Circuit Court's
 omission adversely affected his substantial rights. See id. 
In a similar case, the defendant raised the
 
justification of self-defense to the charged offense of second
 degree murder and the lesser included offenses of reckless
 manslaughter and assault in the second and third degrees. State
 
v. Culkin, 97 Hawai
'i 206, 214, 35 P.3d 233, 241 (2001). Self-
defense instructions were given as to each offense except reckless manslaughter, of which the defendant was ultimately convicted. Id. The court also gave a general instruction that 
self-defense "is a defense to any and all offenses brought against the Defendant in this case." Id. at 218, 35 P.3d at 245. 
The jury sought clarification as to what the court "meant when it said that self-defense was a defense to 'any and all offenses[.]'" Id. at 219, 35 P.3d at 246. The supreme court 
held that, inasmuch as it was unclear from the instructions whether the self-defense justification applied to reckless manslaughter, the trial court had plainly erred. Id. 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the instant case, the Circuit Court's failure to
 
give a "defense of others" instruction as to Robbery in the
 
Second Degree was plain error because it adversely affected
 Waterhouse's substantial right to present a complete defense. 
We next analyze whether the error was harmless beyond a
 
reasonable doubt. Nichols, 111 Hawai 'i at 337, 141 P.3d at 984. 
Waterhouse argues that
 
the lack of the defense to the offense of Robbery in the
Second Degree could have been what caused [Waterhouse's]
conviction for that offense, as the jury was unable to
acquit him of the included offense. To that extent, the
lower court's error was not harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt. . . . 
As there was a basis in the evidence to believe that
 
any threat of force made by [Waterhouse] was for the purpose
of protecting [Vicente], and that would provide a complete
defense to Robbery in the Second Degree, it cannot be said
that the lower court's failure to so instruct was harmless
 beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
The "defense of others" justification, set forth in HRS
 
4
§ 703-305 (2014),  would have provided a complete defense to the
convicted offense of Robbery in the Second Degree had the jury
 
found it applicable. Thus, there was "a reasonable possibility
 that the error contributed to [Waterhouse's] conviction," and the
 error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Nichols, 111
 
Hawai'i at 337, 141 P.3d at 984. 
(3) 	While the Circuit Court instructed the jury on the
 
lesser included offense of Robbery in the Second Degree, it did
 not give an instruction as to any other lesser included offense. 
Waterhouse argues that the Circuit Court erred when it failed to
 instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of Theft in the
 
4	 HRS § 703-305 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 703-305 Use of force for the protection of other
persons.  (1) Subject to the provisions of this section and
of section 703-310, the use of force upon or toward the
person of another is justifiable to protect a third person
when:
 
(a) 	Under the circumstances as the actor believes
 them to be, the person whom the actor seeks to
protect would be justified in using such
protective force; and
(b) 	The actor believes that the actor's intervention
 is necessary for the protection of the other
person.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Fourth Degree because there was a rational basis in the evidence
 
for the jury to acquit Waterhouse of Robbery in the Second Degree
 and find him guilty of Theft in the Fourth Degree. 
The supreme court has held that "with respect to 
instructions on lesser-included offenses, it is axiomatic that providing instructions on all lesser-included offenses with a rational basis in the evidence is essential to the performance of the jury's function." State v. Flores, 131 Hawai
'i 43, 51, 314 
P.3d 120, 128 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Jury instructions on lesser-included offenses must be given where there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense." State v. 
Kaeo, 132 Hawai
'i 451, 465, 323 P.3d 95, 109 (2014) (emphasis in 
original) (quoting Flores, 131 Hawai 'i at 51, 314 P.3d at 128). 
"The failure to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense for which the evidence provides a rational basis warrants vacation of the defendant's conviction." Flores, 131 Hawai
'i at 
58, 314 P.3d at 135. 
In the instant case, Waterhouse was convicted of the
 
offense of Robbery in the Second Degree. Waterhouse contends
 that: (1) Theft in the Fourth Degree in violation of HRS § 708­833 is a lesser included offense of Robbery in the Second Degree;
 and (2) there was a rational basis in the evidence for the jury
 to acquit him of Robbery in the Second Degree and convict him
 instead of Theft in the Fourth Degree.
 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Theft in the Fourth Degree is "theft[5] of property or
 
services of any value not in excess of $100." HRS § 708-833
 
(2014). This court has previously held:
 
Robbery in the Second Degree and Theft in the Fourth Degree
are included offenses of Robbery in the First Degree. State
 
v. Arlt, 9 Haw. App. 263, 277, 833 P.2d 902, 910 (1992)(Robbery in the Second Degree is an included offense ofRobbery in the First Degree); State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai' i 
37, 46, 947 P.2d 349, 358 (1997) (Theft in the Fourth Degreeis an included offense of Robbery in the First Degree). 
State v. Brooks, 123 Hawai 'i 456, 472-73, 235 P.3d 1168, 1184-85 
(App. 2010). See also State v. French, 104 Hawai 'i 89, 93, 85 
P.3d 196, 200 (App. 2004) ("Theft, regardless of degree, is an
 
included offense of first degree robbery.") (citation omitted);
 State v. Arlt, 9 Haw. App. 263, 277, 833 P.2d 902, 910 (1992)
 (noting with approval the trial court's instruction that Theft in
 the Fourth Degree is an included offense of Robbery in the Second
 Degree, which is in turn an included offense of Robbery in the
 First Degree). Thus, we hold that Theft in the Fourth Degree is
 a lesser included offense of Robbery in the Second Degree.
 
We next determine whether there was a rational basis in
 
the evidence for a verdict acquitting Waterhouse of Robbery in
 the Second Degree and convicting him of Theft in the Fourth
 Degree. 
Kaeo, 132 Hawai 'i at 465, 323 P.3d at 109. First, we 
look at the elements of each offense and the state of mind
 required. State v. Abdon, No. CAAP-13-0000086, 2014 WL 4800994
 
5 HRS § 708-830 (2014), in relevant part, defines "theft" as
follows:
 
§ 708-830 Theft.  A person commits theft if the
person does any of the following:
(1) 	Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over
 
property. A person obtains or exerts
unauthorized control over the property of
another with intent to deprive the other of the
property.
(2) 	
Property obtained or control exerted through

deception. A person obtains, or exerts control
over, the property of another by deception with
intent to deprive the other of the property.
. . . . 
(7) 
	Receiving stolen property. A person
intentionally receives, retains, or disposes of
the property of another, knowing that it has
been stolen, with intent to deprive the owner of
the property[.]

at *6 (App. Sept. 26, 2014). Under HRS § 708-841(1)(b), in order
 
to acquit Waterhouse of Robbery in the Second Degree, there must
 be a rational basis for finding that Waterhouse did not
 "threate[n] the imminent use of force against [Dabin] with intent
 to compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with the
 property[.]" There was conflicting testimony about: (1) whether
 Waterhouse had a knife; (2) if Waterhouse had a knife, whether he
 used it to threaten Dabin; (3) whether Waterhouse threatened
 Dabin at all; and (4) if Waterhouse did threaten Dabin, whether
 he acted with the intent to compel Dabin to allow Waterhouse to
 take or escape with the property or with the intent to protect
 his female companion. There was also evidence on which the jury
 could rationally base a finding that Waterhouse had committed
 "theft of property or services of any value not in excess of
 $100" under HRS § 708-833. 
Thus, there was a rational basis in the evidence for 
the jury to acquit Waterhouse of Robbery in the Second Degree and convict him instead of Theft in the Fourth Degree. Kaeo, 132 
Hawai
'i at 465, 323 P.3d at 109. Accordingly, the failure to 
instruct the jury on Theft in the Fourth Degree warrants vacating Waterhouse's conviction. Flores, 131 Hawai
'i at 58, 314 P.3d at 
135.
 
For these reasons, we vacate the Circuit Court's
 
November 27, 2013 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and remand
 for a new trial.
