Driving, in violation of HRS § 291-12 (Supp. 2014)  (Count 3). 
The judgments in this case were based on Canales-Mendoza's

 
conditional plea of no contest to Counts 1 and 2, and plea of no
 
contest to Count 3.
 
On appeal, Canales-Mendoza argues that the district 
court (1) erred in denying his motion to suppress his blood-alcohol test results, which he contends were "fruit of the poisonous tree"; (2) erred in concluding that the police lawfully extracted his blood without his consent, under HRS § 291E-21 (2007); and (3) plainly erred and violated his constitutional rights by accepting his conditional no contest pleas on Counts 1 and 2 without asking if he understood the nature of the charges and whether he was aware of the maximum penalties provided by law, as required by Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 11(c)(1) and (2). Canales-Mendoza does not raise any challenge affecting his no contest plea on Count 3. 
The State concedes that the district court plainly
 
erred in failing to obtain Canales-Mendoza's knowing and
 voluntary conditional no contest pleas on the record. The
 State's concession notwithstanding, "appellate courts have an
 independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of error
 is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to

(C)	 Revocation of license and
 
privilege to operate a vehicle
for an additional two years;
and
 
(D)	 Loss of the privilege to
operate a vehicle equipped
with an ignition interlock
device, if applicable[.]

 HRS § 291-12 provides:
 
§291-12 Inattention to driving. Whoever operates any
vehicle without due care or in a manner as to cause a
 collision with, or injury or damage to, as the case may be,
any person, vehicle or other property shall be fined not
more than $500 or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or
both, and may be subject to a surcharge of up to $100 which
shall be deposited into the trauma system special fund.

determine that such error is properly preserved and 
prejudicial.'" State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai 'i 219, 221–22, 74 
P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (quoting State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai 'i 333, 
336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Canales-Mendoza's points of error as follows.
Points of error (1) and (2). Canales-Mendoza entered a 
conditional no contest plea to Count 1, which included charges of violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (4). Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(4) can each serve as a basis for conviction under HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 61, 276 
P.3d 617, 630 (2012). Canales-Mendoza does not contest his conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Therefore, any error as to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) conviction, including any alleged error related to admissibility of the blood-alcohol test results, was harmless. 
Point of error (3). The district court failed to ask 
Canales-Mendoza if he understood the nature of the charges and whether he was aware of the maximum penalties provided by law, and thus the district court failed to comply with all procedural components of HRPP Rule 11. State v. Davia, 87 Hawai
'i 249, 255, 
953 P.2d 1347, 1353 (1998); see HRPP Rule 11(c); State v. Martin, 102 Hawai
'i 273, 280-81, 75 P.3d 724, 731-32 (App. 2003). Where 
a trial court fails to properly inquire on the record whether a defendant's no contest plea is knowing and voluntary, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the conviction and sentence, and remand the case for a new change of plea hearing before a different judge or, at the defendant's option, for trial. See 
Davia, 87 Hawai
'i at 260, 953 P.2d at 1358. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and
 
Amended Judgement, entered on October 16, 2013 and December 4,
 2013, respectively, in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Wailuku Division, are vacated to the extent that Canales-Mendoza

was convicted and sentenced as to Counts 1 and 2. The case is
 
remanded to the district court for a new plea hearing on those
 counts, before a different judge, or, at Canales-Mendoza's
 option, for trial.
