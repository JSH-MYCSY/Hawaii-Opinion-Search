SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Roger T. Aoyagi (Roger), as personal
 
representative for the Estate of June T. Aoyagi (June) (in his
 
capacity as representative of June's Estate, Roger will be
 
referred to as Appellant), appeals from the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's (Circuit Court) Judgment in favor of Defendant-
Appellees Estate of Cindy H. Aoyagi (the decedent will be
 
referred to as Cindy), Glenn Y. Ota (Glenn), and Janis Y. Ota
 
(Janis) (collectively, Appellees) filed on December 9, 2013
 (Judgment), and challenges the Circuit Court's Order Granting in
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Part Defendants' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs ( Order)
filed on November 6, 2013.1 
Appellant raises five points of error, contending that
the Circuit Court erred in:
(1) dismissing the claim for specific performance as
being time barred by the statute of limitations;
(2) dismissing the claim for specific performance as
being time barred by the doctrines of waiver or laches;
(3) declining to cancel the deed from Cindy to Glenn on
grounds of undue influence;
(4) declining to declare a constructive or resulting
trust in favor of Tara A.R. Aoyagi, aka Tara Aoyagi Lumford
(Tara) with respect to the subject property; and
(5) The Circuit Court erred in granting the Appellees
request for attorneys' fees and costs.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Appellant's points of error as follows:
(1)Appellant contends that the Circuit Court erred in
dismissing a claim for specific performance as being time barred
by the six-year statute of limitations period in HRS § 657-1
(2016), the one-year statute of limitations period in HRS § 535-1
(2006), and the eighteen-month statute of limitations period in
HRS § 560:3-803 (2006).  The Circuit Court determined only that
1The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided, except to the
extent noted below.
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the breach of contract claim in Count I of the four-count
 
complaint was time-barred.2 We consider Appellant's arguments
 
in this context.
 Appellant argues that HRS § 657-1(1) does not apply to
 
a contract claim for specific performance. HRS § 657-1 states in
 pertinent part
:
 
The following actions shall be commenced within six years
next after the cause of action accrued, and not after:
 
(1) 	Actions for the recovery of any debt founded upon any
contract, obligation, or liability, excepting such as
are brought upon the judgment or decree of a court[.]
 
. . . . 
(4) 	Personal actions of any nature whatsoever not
specifically covered by the laws of the State. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has recognized that the 
appropriate statute of limitations period is determined by the 
"nature of the claim or right, not the form or pleading." Au v. 
Au, 63 Haw. 210, 214, 626 P.2d 173, 177 (1981) (citations omitted). Furthermore, "[t]he nature of the right or claim is determined from the allegations contained in the pleadings." Id. 
(citation omitted). In Count I of the complaint, Appellant contends that "[Appellees] have breached and caused the breach of the [1989] Agreement between [June] and [Cindy] by failing to provide [Appellant] with a deed to the Property, as required by the [1989] Agreement." Thus, the nature of the claim in Count I is based on a breach of contract, subject to the six-year statute
 of limitations set for in HRS § 657-1.
 
2
 The Circuit Court concluded that Appellant's claim for tortious
breach of contract in Count II failed to state a claim as a matter of law. 
With regard to the claims for undue influence in Count III, and violation of
HRS § 535-1 in Count IV, at the conclusion of the jury-waived trial, the
Circuit Court determined that Appellant failed to meet her burden of proof.
 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Generally, the time limit to institute an action based 
upon a claim for breach of contract begins when the contract is 
breached. Id. at 219, 626 P.2d at 180. Here, pursuant to the 
1989 Agreement, Cindy promised to provide a half interest in a property located in Waipahu (Property) to June in return for the 
$25,000.00 loan.  However, Cindy did not provide June with a 
half interest in the Property. Instead, on October 3, 1989, 
Halekua Development Corporation executed a deed conveying the Property only to Cindy in fee simple. The deed was filed with the Bureau of Conveyances on October 20, 1989, and no interest was thereafter conveyed to June. Fee simple is defined as "[a]n interest in land that, being the broadest property interest allowed by law, endures until the current holder dies without heirs[.]" 
Black's Law Dictionary  691 (9th ed. 2009). "'Fee 
simple absolute' and 'fee simple' represent the entire and absolute interest and property in the land. No one can have a greater interest." 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estates § 13 (2016) (footnote omitted). This court has recognized that the "central purpose of recording a conveyance of real property is to give notice to the general public of the conveyance[.]" Markham v. Markham, 80 
Hawai
'i 274, 281, 909 P.2d 602, 609 (App. 1996). Accordingly, 
the Circuit Court did not err in its determination that Cindy breached the 1989 Agreement in 1989. The complaint was filed in 2010, and served in 2011, well outside of Hawaii's six-year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims. 
Appellant argues, however, that "the six-year statute of

 
limitations would ordinarily bar [Appellant's] claim for the
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$25,000 amount of the loan, unless the offer by [Glenn] to pay
 
[Cindy's father, Tom T. Aoyagi (Tom),] revived the claim and
 
started the statutory period anew" and that, in this case,
 
Glenn's offer "created a new obligation, with a new six-year
 statute of limitations." Appellees argue, inter alia, that no
 new obligation was created because Tom declined Glenn's offer on
 two occasions.
 
In order to create a binding contract, "there must be an
 
acceptance of the offer; until the offer is accepted, both
 parties have not assented, or, in the language often used by the
 courts, their minds have not met." 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts §
 66 (2004) (footnote omitted). A binding contract is created when
 there is "mutual assent or a meeting of the minds on all
 essential elements or terms." Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark
 
Const., Inc., 56 Haw. 466, 470, 540 P.2d 978, 982 (1975). 
Furthermore, an "offer is terminated by rejection and cannot be
 accepted so as to create a contract after it has been rejected." 
17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts
 § 64. Tom refused Glenn's offer to pay
 
the $25,000.00 loan. Thus, there was no contract created. 
Therefore, we conclude that Appellant's argument is without
 merit.
 
As we have concluded that Appellant's breach of contract

 
claim was time-barred pursuant to HRS § 657-1, we need not
 address Appellant's argument that the Circuit Court erred in its
 alternative ruling based on HRS § 560:3-803. Similarly, we need
 not reach the Circuit Court's decision concerning the timeliness
 of Appellant's claim under HRS § 535-1.
 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) The Circuit Court also concluded that Appellant's
 
breach of contract claim in Count I was barred by the doctrine of
 
laches and waiver. As the breach of contract claim is barred by
 the statute of limitations, we need not reach laches and waiver. 
Despite Appellant's arguments to the contrary, the Circuit Court
 
did not conclude that Appellant waived her undue influence claim
 in Count III.
 
(3) The Circuit Court concluded, after the trial on
 
the merits, that Appellant had "presented no evidence of undue
 influence when Cindy executed her estate planning documents on
 July 21, 2008." 
This jurisdiction has "recognized and impliedly adopted 
the 'SODR' factors in determining whether the exertion of undue influence resulted in the execution of a challenged will." In re 
Estate of Herbert, 90 Hawai
'i 443, 458, 979 P.2d 39, 54 (1999). 
The SODR factors are "susceptibility of the testator or testatrix, opportunity for the exertion of undue influence, disposition to exert undue influence, and the result, in the will, of such undue influence." Id. at 457, 979 P.2d at 453. 
(citation and brackets omitted). The supreme court recognized that in order to "sustain a claim of undue influence, it must appear that the influence exercised amounted to fraud or coercion destroying free agency, or the substitution of another's will for that of the testator or testatrix so that the product is not that of the testator or testatrix." Id. at 458, 979 P.2d at 54 
(citation and brackets omitted). 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In this case, there is evidence in the record indicating
 
that Cindy possessed the mental capacity to execute her estate
 
plan. In response to questions posed by Appellees' counsel,
 Yumiko Watson (Yumiko), one of the witnesses to Cindy's will,
 
testified that Cindy was of sound mind, and was not under
 
constraint or undue influence when she signed the will. Janis
 also testified that Cindy was alert when she signed her will. 
Janis stated that she believed that Cindy voluntarily signed her
 will. Gail Aoki (Gail), Cindy's cousin, testified that
 
throughout Cindy's stay in the hospital and hospice, her mind
 
remained sharp and clear. Michelle Hobus, Esq. (Michelle), the
 
estate planning lawyer who spoke and met with Cindy and drafted
 
Cindy's will, also testified that she had "no concerns about
 [Cindy's] mental state and her ability to understand and to sign
 the documents [in her estate plan]." Additionally, Dr. Rae S. 
Seitzs (Dr. Seitz), Cindy's primary care physician, testified
 
that "Cindy was always alert. She always knew what was going on.
 She understood her treatment options and aspects of her care." 
Dr. Seitz believed that Cindy was capable of making financial
 decisions and estate-planning decisions.
 
In addition, there is no evidence indicating that Cindy
 
was coerced into executing her estate plan. The record contains
 testimony from numerous witnesses regarding Cindy's intentions
 for her Property. Prior to drafting her estate plan, Cindy told
 Michelle that she did not want her parents or Roger to receive
 the Property. Michelle testified that "[Cindy] was comfortable
 with the idea that Glenn would manage the property for Tara's
 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
benefit until the appropriate time, and [Cindy] felt very
 
comfortable that [Glenn] understood her wishes and that he would
 effectuate those wishes." Gail testified that Cindy did not
 regret selecting Glenn to manage her Property, and that Cindy
 trusted him. Gail also testified that Cindy was adamant that she
 did not want Roger to get the Property. Dr. Seitz was aware that
 Cindy did not want her parents or Roger to receive her Property.
 It is apparent from the testimony that Cindy's estate plan
 reflected her intentions for her Property. 
Moreover, the record indicates that Cindy was aware that
 
she could amend her estate plan. Gail informed Cindy that she
 could change her estate plan at any time. Additionally, Gail
 also testified that Glenn and Janis did not prevent Cindy from
 changing her estate plan. In fact, Glenn and Janis informed
 Cindy that she could change her estate plan at anytime. Glenn
 agreed to sign a release of his remainder interest, in case Cindy
 changed her mind about her estate plan. Glenn and Janis
 testified that they did not tell Cindy that it would cost
 $5,000.00 to change her will. Gail related that despite the fact
 that Cindy was under pressure from Tom to change her estate plan,
 Cindy did not change her mind about her estate plan. Dr. Seitz
 also heard Cindy tell Tom that she did not want to change her
 estate plan.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court did not err when it
 
concluded that there was no evidence of undue influence.
 
(4) Appellant's complaint does not set forth a claim
 
for a constructive trust. Appellant nevertheless argues that a
 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
constructive trust is an appropriate form of relief because the
 
issue of a constructive trust was "tried by express or implied
 consent of the parties" under Rule 15(b)(1) of the Hawai
�i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
Rule 15(b)(1) of the HRCP states: 
(b) Amendments During and After Trial.
 
(1) FOR ISSUES TRIED BY CONSENT.  When issues not raised by the
pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the
parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had
been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings
as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence
and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party
at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does
not affect the result of the trial of these issues.
 
The supreme court has recognized that Rule 15(b) is not
 
permissive, and that "[a]s long as issues are tried by the
 
express or implied consent of the parties to a lawsuit, the
 issues 'shall be treated as if raised in pleadings.'" 
Cresencia
 
v. Kim, 10 Haw. App. 461, 478, 878 P.2d 725, 734 (1994) (citation
 omitted). Furthermore, 
Express consent may be found in a stipulation, or
may be incorporated a pretrial order. 
Consent is generally implied when the party opposing a
Rule 15(b) motion fails to object to the introduction of
evidence relevant to an unpleaded issue, or actually produces
evidence bearing on the new issue. However, a party's failure
to object will not constitute implied consent unless the party
had notice that evidence was being introduced to prove the
unpleaded issue. Furthermore, consent will not be implied if a
party will be substantially prejudiced by such an amendment.
 
Id. at 478, 878 P.2d at 734-35 (citations omitted).
 In the instant case, Appellants did not file a Motion
 
to Amend the Complaint under HRCP Rule 15. There was no
 
stipulation, pretrial order or other indication that Appellees
 expressly consented to the constructive trust issue. The record
 indicates that Appellees did not impliedly consent to the issue
 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of constructive trust. In closing argument, Appellant's counsel 
arguably alluded to a constructive trust for the first time, stating: "Tara should get the property. As the court of equity you have -- you have ways in which you can manifest that." Prior to closing argument, Appellees had no notice that Appellant was seeking the imposition of a constructive trust. If the Appellees had known that Appellant was seeking the imposition of a constructive trust, then they "presumably would have proceeded differently with the presentation of evidence, questioning of witnesses, and argument." Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & 
Stifel, 117 Hawai
'i 92, 113, 176 P.3d 91, 112 (2008). 
Appellant argues that the issue of constructive trust
 
was tried by implied consent because evidence of Cindy's
 intentions to give her Property to Tara was introduced at trial,
 contending that "[a]ll the facts that support a claim for
 constructive trust, support a claim for undue influence." 
However, this court has recognized that:
 
When the evidence that is claimed to show that an issue was
 
tried by consent is relevant to an issue already in the case,
as well as to the one that is the subject matter of the
amendment, and there was no indication at trial that the party
who introduced the evidence was seeking to raise a new issue,
the pleadings will not be deemed amended under the first
portion of Rule 15(b). The reasoning behind this view is that
if evidence is introduced to support basic issues that already
have been pleaded, the opposing party may not be conscious of
its relevance to issues not raised by the pleadings unless
that fact is made clear.
 
Cresencia, 10 Haw. App. at 479-80, 878 P.3d at 735 (citations and
 
brackets omitted). 
Here, the evidence of Cindy's intentions to give her
 
Property to Tara is relevant to the undue influence claim. 
Appellant introduced evidence that Cindy wanted her Property to
 
10  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
go to Tara to prove that Cindy was unduly influenced into
 
executing her will. There was no indication at trial that
 Appellant introduced this evidence because he was seeking the
 imposition of a constructive trust for Tara. Moreover,
 Appellees' counsel objected when Appellant attempted to introduce
 evidence that was not relevant to the claims in the complaint. 
At trial, Appellant's counsel asked Michelle whether the
 revocable trust was for Tara. Appellees' counsel objected, and
 stated that "Tara has no counter-complaint related to anything .
 . . we have a breach of 1989 contract. We have tortious breach
 of 1989 contract. We have undue influence that Glenn and Janis
 exerted on Cindy to preclude her from effectuating her estate
 plan, and nothing else." Appellant's counsel also asked
 Michelle, "Do you think [Glenn] would be honoring the wishes of
 Cindy if he continued to maintain possession of the property that
 Cindy had willed to him indefinitely?" Appellees' counsel
 objected and stated that "the complaint has nothing to do with
 Tara or these wishes. It's entirely irrelevant." Upon review of
 the record, it is clear that Appellees did not consent to try the
 issue of a constructive trust. 
Even if the parties had consented to amending the
 
pleading, there is no clear and convincing evidence that a
 constructive trust should be imposed. Maria v. Freitas, 73 Haw.
 
266, 274, 832 P.2d 259, 264 (1992). It is well-established that
 "[a] constructive trust will be imposed where the evidence is
 clear and convincing that one party will be unjustly enriched if
 allowed to retain the entire property." Id. (citation omitted). 
11  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The "clear and convincing" evidence standard has been recognized
 
as: 
[A]n intermediate standard of proof greater than a
preponderance of the evidence, but less than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt required in criminal cases. It is that degree
of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a
firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be
established, and requires the existence of a fact be highly
probable. 
Iddings v. Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai 'i 1, 13, 919 P.2d 263, 275 (1996) 
(citations omitted). 
As discussed, Cindy's estate plan reflected her
 
intentions for her Property. Although Cindy expressed a desire
 
to eventually give her Property to Tara, she was concerned that
 Tara was not responsible. As such, Cindy decided to convey the
 Property to Glenn. Prior to signing the will and deed, Michelle
 explained to Cindy that upon her death, Glenn would become the
 sole owner of the Property, and her estate would have no interest
 in the Property. With this knowledge, Cindy signed the will and
 deed. Cindy possessed the mental capacity to execute her estate
 plan and there is no evidence that Cindy was coerced into
 executing her estate plan. Moreover, despite pressure from Tom,
 Cindy did not change her estate plan. Thus, there is no clear
 and convincing evidence indicating that Glenn will be unjustly
 enriched at Tara's expense. We also conclude that Appellant's
 remaining arguments relating to the termination and revocation of
 a constructive trust are without merit.
 
(5) Appellant argues that attorneys' fees should not
 
have been awarded under HRS § 607-14 (2016) because the claims
 were not in the "nature of assumpsit." HRS § 607-14 provides,
 in relevant part, that: 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
¶ 607-14 Attorneys' fees in actions in the nature of assumpsit, etc.
 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of
assumpsit and in all actions on a promissory note or other
contract in writing that provides for an attorney's fee, there
shall be taxed as attorneys' fees, to be paid by the losing
party and to be included in the sum for which execution may
issue, a fee that the court determines to be reasonable;
provided that the attorney representing the prevailing party
shall submit to the court an affidavit stating the amount of
time the attorney spent on the action and the amount of time
the attorney is likely to spend to obtain a final written
judgment, or, if the fee is not based on an hourly rate, the
amount of the agreed upon fee. The court shall then tax
attorneys' fees, which the court determines to be reasonable,
to be paid by the losing party; provided that this amount
shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the judgment.
 
"Assumpsit is a common law form of action which allows
 
for the recovery of damages for the non-performance of a
 
contract, either express or implied, written or verbal, as well
 as quasi contractual obligations." Schulz v. Honsador, Inc., 67
 
Haw. 433, 435, 690 P.2d 279, 281 (1984) (citation omitted), 

 
overruled on other grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai 'i 327, 332, 
31 P.3d 184, 189 (2001). The supreme court has stated that: 
[I]n ascertaining the nature of the proceeding on appeal,
[the supreme] court has looked to the essential character
of the underlying action in the [circuit] court.
 
. . . .
 The character of the action should be determined from the
 
facts and issues raised in the complaint, the nature of the
entire grievance, and the relief sought. Where there is doubt
as to whether an action is in assumpsit or in tort, there is a
presumption that the suit is in assumpsit. Further, a
plaintiff's prayer for attorney fees is a significant
indication that the action is in assumpsit.
 
Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 93 Hawai 'i 1, 5-6, 994 P.2d 1047, 
1051-52 (2000) (citations omitted).
 
Appellant relies on Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai 'i 19, 936 P.2d 
655 (1997), and Smothers v. Renander, 2 Haw. App. 400, 633 P.2d
 
556 (1981), in support of his proposition that "claims for
 specific performance, are not in the nature of assumpsit, as they
 seek injunctive or declaratory relief rather than damages." The
 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
supreme court has acknowledged that a "suit to enforce an 
agreement is a suit for specific performance and is not an action in the nature of assumpsit." Lee, 85 Hawai
'i at 31, 936 P.2d at 
667. In Lee, the supreme court concluded that a claim for
 
specific enforcement of an agreement was not an action in the
 nature of assumpsit, even thought the claimant also prayed for
 damages. Id. at 31-32, 936 P.2d at 667-68. In Smothers, the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals determined that a claim for
 specific performance is not in the nature of assumpsit, and HRS §
 607-14 does not apply. Smothers, 2 Haw. App. at 404-405, 633
 
P.2d at 561. However, the court also noted that a portion of a
 counterclaim was in the "'nature of assumpsit' and HRS § 607-14
 (1976) is applicable to that portion." Id. at 405, 633 P.2d at
 
561. 
Since Lee and Smothers, the supreme court has recognized 
that "in awarding attorneys' fees in a case involving both assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims, a court must base its award of fees, if practicable, on an apportionment of the fees claimed between assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims." Blair, 96 Hawai
'i 
at 332, 31 P.3d at 189 (citing TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 734 (1999)). 
In the instant case, the following claims for relief
 
were alleged in the complaint: (1) breach of contract, (2)
 tortious breach of contract, (3) undue influence, and (4)
 violation of HRS § 535-1.
3 The breach of contract claim alleges
 
3
 HRS § 535-1 provides: 
When any person, who is bound by a contract in writing
 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that Cindy had breached the 1989 Agreement. The tortious breach
 
of contract claim is based on the allegation that Glenn and Janis
 caused the breach of the 1989 Agreement. The undue influence
 claim alleges that Cindy's lack of capacity and Appellees undue
 influence caused Cindy to convey the Property to Glenn in
 violation of the 1989 Agreement. As the nature and character of
 Appellant's entire grievance relates to the assertion that Cindy
 breached her contractual obligations to June, which is in the
 nature of assumpsit, we conclude that these claims are in the
 nature of assumpsit.
 
Similarly, although Appellant's claim for specific
 
performance under HRS § 535-1 is not in the nature of assumpsit,
 it is also related to the breach of the 1989 Agreement and
 Appellant seeks damages and attorneys' fees, as well as specific
 performance.
 
As the claims in this case involve both assumpsit and 
non-assumpsit claims, this court "must examine whether claims where attorneys' fees are allowed can be segregated from claims where they are not allowed, which can be done by looking at whether the claims 'involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories.'" Fyffe v. Hue, No. 28316, 2010 WL 
3409655 at *3 (Haw. App. Aug. 31, 2010) (SDO) (citing Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai
'i 42, 67-68, 169 P.3d 994, 1019-20 (App. 2007)). 
As in Fyffe, Appellant's "demands for damages and specific 
to convey any real estate, dies before making the
conveyance, the other party may commence an action in a
circuit court to enforce a specific performance of the
contract, the action to be commenced within one year after
the grant of administration.
 
15 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
performance were based on a common set of facts and argued 
simultaneously before the circuit court." Id. Thus, we conclude 
that "it is impracticable, if not impossible, to apportion the fees between the assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims." Blair, 96 
Hawai
'i at 333, 31 P.3d at 190. Based on the foregoing, we 
conclude the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees. 
Appellant also argues that "even if the court believes 
that it can apportion the claim for attorneys fees between the assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims, the amount thereof should be limited to twenty-five percent to the amount of rental income." In Piedvache v. Knabusch, the supreme court acknowledged that HRS § 607-14 "does not expressly instruct the courts as to how to calculate an award of attorney's fees when no precise monetary amount is sought in the pleadings." 88 Hawai
'i 115, 118, 962 
P.2d 374, 377 (1998). The court determined that "where it is impossible to determine what the judgment would or might have been had the plaintiff prevailed (e.g., in declaratory judgment actions), the defendant may be awarded all of his or her reasonable attorney's fees." Id. at 119, 962 P.2d at 378. If 
the amount of potential judgment is ascertainable, the twenty-five per cent cap will apply because the legislature contemplated that "some limit on the amount of attorney's fees that a prevailing party could reasonably recover." Id. This court has 
recognized that it is within the trial court's discretion to determine "how to calculate attorney's fees when no precise monetary amount is sought in the pleadings." Waikoloa Dev. Co.

V. Waikaa Heights Land Inv'rs, No. 30043, 2013 WL 2156057 at *6 
(Haw. App. May 20, 2013) (Memo Op) at *6 (citing Piedvache, 88 Hawai
'i at 118, 962 P.2d at 377). 
In the complaint, Appellant requested punitive damages
 
and "damages as shall be proven at trial, including payment of
 receipts for rentals for the Property." Accordingly, the Circuit
 Court determined that the "amount sued for" "totals the value of
 the Property, the rental proceeds collected from the date of
 Cindy's death through May 15, 2013 . . . and prejudgment interest
 on both the Property value and the rental proceeds through May
 15, 2013." The Circuit Court noted that "[d]epending on whether
 the court values the Property based on a 2009 appraisal, 2009 tax
 assessed value, or 2010 tax assessed value, the total 'amount
 sued for' ranges from $728,107.23 to $768,415.40." The Circuit
 Court then concluded that "25% of each of these amounts is
 $182,026.81 to $192,878.91," and that "[Appellees'] fee request
 of $111,319.85 is less than the 25% statutory cap required by HRS
 § 607-14." Upon review, we conclude that the Circuit Court did
 not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees.
 
Finally, without citing to any authority, Appellant
 
challenges the Circuit Court's grant of costs in the amount of

 
$3,240.42. We note that Appellees moved for attorneys' fees and
 costs under HRCP Rule 54(d) and HRS § 607-9 (2016).
4 HRCP Rule

 HRS § 607-9 provides:
 
[(a)] No other costs of court shall be charged in any
court in addition to those prescribed in this chapter in any
suit, action, or other proceeding, except as otherwise
provided by law.

54(d) provides "[e]xcept when express provision therefor is made 
either in a statute or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs." See also Wong v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai
'i 46, 52, 961 P.2d 
611, 617 (1998) (recognizing strong presumption that prevailing party will recover costs). 
In Wong, the supreme court held that "when costs are
 
awardable to a prevailing party under HRCP Rule 54(d) and a
 particular taxable cost is allowed by statute or precedent, then
 actual disbursements for this purpose are presumptively
 reasonable." Id. at 53-54, 961 P.2d at 618-19. The adverse
 
party has the burden of proving that a cost request is
 unreasonable. Id. at 54, 961 P.2d at 619. The "award of a
 
taxable cost is within the discretion of the trial court and will
 not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion." Id. at 52,
 
961 P.2d at 617 (citation omitted). 
Appellees are the prevailing party and requested a total
 
of $908.38 for copying, $52.86 for postage, $457.60 for parking,
 and $1,821.58 for deposition transcripts.  Appellees' request for
 
copying, postage and deposition transcripts are expressly
 
allowable under HRS § 607-9. 
See supra  at note 4. With regard
 
to Appellees' request for their parking expense, the supreme
 
[(b)] All actual disbursements, including but
not limited to, intrastate travel expenses for
witnesses and counsel, expenses for deposition
transcript originals and copies, and other incidental
expenses, including copying costs, intrastate long
distance telephone charges, and postage, sworn to by
an attorney or a party, and deemed reasonable by the
court, may be allowed in taxation of costs. In
determining whether and what costs should be taxed,
the court may consider the equities of the situation.

court recognized that "[e]xpenditures for parking, rental car, 
and gas, while not specifically enumerated in the language of HRS § 607-9, are within the scope of 'intrastate travel expenses.' They are necessary expenditures when traveling intrastate." Wong, 88 Hawai
'i at 54, 961 P.2d at 619. Therefore, Appellees' 
requests for copying, postage, parking, and deposition transcripts are presumptively reasonable. Appellant does not argue that Appellees' cost request was unreasonable. The supreme court noted that "[i]n the absence of a challenge to a particular request, it is not an abuse of discretion for a court to award the cost requested as presumptively reasonable." Id. (footnote 
omitted). We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Appellees' costs. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Circuit Court's December
 
9, 2013 Judgment is affirmed.
