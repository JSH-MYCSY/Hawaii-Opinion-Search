RITALYNN MOSS CELESTINE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-00956)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.;
with Nakamura, Chief Judge, dissenting separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Ritalynn Moss Celestine (
Celestine)
 
appeals from Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment filed on September 17, 2013 and December 17, 2013
 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiaw
a Division
 
(District Court) convicting her of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and
 
(a)(3).

On appeal, Celestine contends that:
 
(1) the District Court erred in denying her Motion to
 
Suppress her breath alcohol content test result because (a)
 Celestine was entitled to an attorney prior to testing under
 statutory and constitutional law, (b) she did not make a knowing
 or intelligent decision to submit to testing because the form was

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
inaccurate and misleading, and (c) no warrant exception existed
 
to justify the non-consensual testing; and 
(2) the District Court violated Celestine's 
constitutional right to testify when it failed to properly advise her of her right to testify and ensure that her waiver was voluntary and knowing, although Celestine concedes that the District Court's pretrial advisement complied with the requirements of State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 
(2000). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties as
 well as the relevant legal authorities, we resolve Celestine's
 points of error as follows and affirm.
 
(1) Motion to suppress.
 We need not resolve Celestine's point of error 
regarding her motion to suppress. "Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E–61[,]" and where Celestine's point of error related to the motion to suppress does not affect her conviction under subsection (a)(1), her conviction under HRS § 291E–61(a)(1) will stand. State v Nesmith, 127 Hawai
'i 48, 61, 
276 P3d 617, 630 (2012); State v. Fisher, No. SCWC-12-0000684, 2016 WL 2941079 (Apr. 25, 2016) (SDO). 
(2) Tachibana rights. 
The District Court did not plainly err in advising
 
Celestine of her constitutional rights related to her right to
 testify and ensuring that her waiver was voluntary and knowing.
 
Celestine concedes that the District Court's pretrial 
advisement complied with the requirements of State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000). Celestine, however, contends 
2
that the District Court's Tachibana  colloquy "was insufficient
2/
 In Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), the
supreme court stated that the trial court should advise the defendant: 
that he or she has a right to testify, that if he or she wants to

testify that no one can prevent him or her from doing so, and that

to adequately inform Celestine of all the aspects of her right to
 
testify or not to testify." Celestine asserts that the trial
 court erred in not breaking down the colloquy into logical and
 understandable segments with a dialogue with her after each
 segment, as the court did in State v. Christian, 88 Hawai
'i 407, 
967 P.2d 239 (1998). She further contends the District Court
 failed to engage in a true colloquy which demonstrates her
 understanding and a knowing and voluntary waiver, similar to the
 failings in State v. Han, 130 Hawai
'i 83, 306 P.3d 128 (2013). 
We look to the totality of the facts and circumstances
 
to determine whether Celestine's waiver of her right to testify
 was voluntarily and intelligently undertaken. See Id. at 89, 306
 P.3d at 134. Here, prior to the presentation of testimony, the
 District Court engaged Celestine in a colloquy of the pretrial
 
3
 advisement consistent with Lewis and State v. Monteil, 134
4
Hawai'i 361, 373, 341 P.3d 567, 579 (2014),  as follows.
2/(...continued)
if he or she testifies the prosecution will be allowed to

cross-examine him or her. In connection with the privilege against
self-incrimination, the defendant should also be advised that he
or she has a right not to testify and that if he or she does not
testify then the jury can be instructed about that right.
 
Id. at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 (brackets omitted) (quoting State v.
Neuman, 371 S.E.2d 77, 82 (W. Va.1988)).

 Lewis stated:
 
Therefore, we now mandate that, in trials beginning after the date
of this opinion, such advice shall be imparted by the trial courts
to defendants, that is, the trial courts prior to the start of
trial, shall (1) inform the defendant of his or her personal right
to testify or not to testify and (2) alert the defendant that, if
he or she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court
will briefly question him or her to ensure that the decision not
to testify is the defendant's own decision.
 
State v Lewis, 94 Hawai'i 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000) (emphasis added)
(quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted), holding modified by State
v. Monteil, 134 Hawai'i 361, 341 P.3d 567 (2014).
4/
 The supreme court stated:
 
Therefore, we hold that in order to more fully protect the
right not to testify under the Hawai' i Constitution, the trial
courts when informing the defendant of the right not to testifyduring the pretrial advisement must also advise the defendant thatthe exercise of this right may not be used by the fact finder todecide the case. This requirement will be effective in trials

THE COURT: Okay. Miss Celestine, to advise you of your
rights at trial, at some point in time the State will rest, okay,
and you'll have an opportunity to testify or remain silent. Should
you choose to remain silent, the Court can infer no guilt because
of your silence. Basically, you'll be invoking your Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination. Okay, you understand?
 
[CELESTINE]: Yes, sir.
 
THE COURT: However, if you do wish to testify, you
need to be sworn in, you're also subject to cross-examination by
the State's attorney. Okay?
 
[CELESTINE]: Okay. 
[THE COURT 
5
]:  And when the State does rest, okay,
I'll remind you again, okay, I have to finish this even though
we're doing this piece -- piecemeal today.

 
All right. Any questions? Okay. Thank you.
 
Thus, Celestine told the District Court she understood what the
 
court had said and did not indicate any questions at that time. 
On the next trial date, after defense counsel informed
the court "Miss Moss Celestine has been advised of her right
 to -- to testify and she would like to remain silent[,]" the
 following colloquy ensued between the District Court and
 Celestine.
 
 
THE COURT: Okay. Just in caution, okay, I had
explained to you, okay, on the 12th that you had the right to
testify and the right to remain silent, okay. They call this your
Tachibana rights. It’s based on a case law that the appellate
court found that the trial court needed to inform you of your
rights, okay. If you chose not to testify, the Court could infer
no guilt because of your silence; basically you would be invoking
your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Okay. On
the other hand, if you do wish to testify, you need to be sworn
in, you also will be subject to cross-examination by the State’s
attorney. 
Okay. Your attorney just indicated to the Court that
you will not be testifying. Is that correct?

 
[CELESTINE]: Yes, sir.
 
THE COURT: Okay. Is anybody forcing you not to
testify?

beginning after the date of this opinion. The inclusion of this
information in the pretrial advisement will enhance the even
balance of the trial court's statement to defendants regarding the
right to testify or the right not to testify. See Lewis, 94
Hawai‘i at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236.

 It appears that the transcript is in error, where it indicates
Celestine is speaking, because in context, the court would have made the
statements indicated.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[CELESTINE]: No, sir.
 
THE COURT: Okay. It’s your own decision?
 [CELESTINE]: Yes, sir.
 THE COURT: Okay, very good, why don’t you have a seat.
And defense rests. You’re going to argue the motion to suppress
first?
 
Citing the Tachibana colloquy provided in Christian, 88 
Hawai'i at 414–15, 967 P.2d at 246–47, Celestine argues that the 
Tachibana colloquy in her case was deficient because the District 
Court did not provide the same type of advisement by asking after each right was addressed whether she understood that right. We disagree. Although the Hawai
'i Supreme Court concluded in 
Christian that “the trial judge assiduously followed the procedures mandated in Tachibana[,]” Christian, 88 Hawai
'i at 
420, 967 P.2d at 252, and has cited the Tachibana colloquy in Christian as a model, see Han, 130 Hawai
'i at 91 n.6, 306 P.3d at 
136 n.6, the supreme court has not held that the method used to conduct the Tachibana colloquy in Christian is the only way to obtain a valid waiver. Indeed in Han, the supreme court stated that the first time the trial court should have requested a response from the defendant was after the trial court had advised the defendant that he had a right to testify, that the decision to testify was his alone, that no one could force him to testify, that he had the right to remain silent, and that if he exercised that right, the jury would be instructed not to hold that against him. Han, 130 Hawai
'i at 90–91, 306 P.3d at 135–36. Accordingly, 
stopping after each right of the Tachibana advisement is addressed to determine whether the defendant understands the right is not a per se requirement for an adequate Tachibana colloquy. That said, because the method used in Christian to conduct the Tachibana colloquy has been cited favorably by the supreme court, it appears to provide a safe harbor and clear method for establishing a valid Tachibana colloquy. 
Celestine relies upon Han in arguing that the Tachibana
 
colloquy in this case was deficient. We conclude that Celestine's
 reliance on Han is misplaced. Unlike in this case, there was a
 language barrier in Han which was a "salient fact," and the trial
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court in Han did not ask Han whether he understood his rights, 
did not obtain Han's acknowledgment that he understood his rights, and did not advise Han of all the rights required by Tachibana. See Han, 130 Hawai
'i at 88, 90–91, 306 P.3d at 133, 
135–36. Han is therefore distinguishable and does not control the decision in this case. 
In this case, the District Court advised Celestine of
 
all the rights required by Tachibana, asked Celestine whether she
 understood those rights, and obtained her acknowledgment that she
 understood her rights. There is nothing in the record to suggest
 that Celestine lacked an understanding of her rights. We conclude
 that the Tachibana colloquy in this case was adequate and that
 Celestine's on-the-record waiver of her right to testify was
 valid.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notices of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on
 September 17, 2013 and December 17, 2013 in the District Court of
 the First Circuit, Wahiaw
a Division, are affirmed.
