OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
FRANCISCAN VILLAS LLC; PACIFIC ISLAND REALTY LLC,

v.
 
ST. FRANCIS RESIDENTIAL CARE COMMUNITY;
ST. FRANCIS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OF HAWAII,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.
 NO. 13-1-0222)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Respondent-Appellant St. Francis
 
Residential Care Community's ("Appellant St. Francis Residential
 Care Community") appeal from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's 
(1) December 10, 2013 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions
of Law and Order Regarding Claimants' Motion to
Compel Respondents to Participate in Arbitration
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Filed on April 29, 2013" (hereinafter "the
December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration"),
and
 
(2) February 3, 2014 order denying Appellant St.
Francis Residential Care Community and Respondent-
Appellee St. Francis Healthcare System of Hawaii's
("Appellee St. Francis Healthcare System of
Hawaii") motion for reconsideration of the
December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration
(hereinafter "the February 3, 2014 order denying
reconsideration"),
 
because the December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration is not
 
an appealable order under the collateral order doctrine and
 Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013),
 and, thus, Appellant St. Francis Residential Care Community is
 not entitled to appellate review of the February 3, 2014 order
 denying reconsideration under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") and the principle that "[t]he
 notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal disposition of all
 post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of
 judgment or order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
HRS § 658A-28(a)(1) (Supp. 2013) authorizes an appeal
 
from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration:
 
§ 658A-28. Appeals.
(a) An appeal may be taken from:
(1) An order denying a motion to compel
arbitration;
(2) An order granting a motion to stay
arbitration;
(3) An order confirming or denying
confirmation of an award;
(4) An order modifying or correcting an
award;
(5) An order vacating an award without
directing a rehearing; or
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this
chapter.
(b) An appeal under this section shall be taken
as from an order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 658A-28 (emphasis added). However, HRS § 658A-28(a) does
 
not authorize an appeal from an order granting a motion to compel
 arbitration. Therefore, to the extent that the December 10, 2013
 order compelling arbitration requires Appellant St. Francis
 Residential Care Community to participate in arbitration, the
 December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration is not appealable
 pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a).
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgment, orders, or decrees. However, appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds that "[a]n appeal 
may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On February 20, 2014, the circuit court clerk filed the record on 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000337, which 
does not contain a final judgment. Therefore, the December 10, 2013 order compelling is not yet eligible for appellate review under HRS § 641-1(a). 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), the December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding certification of an interlocutory order for an appeal). 
We note in particular that, in order to qualify for
 
appealability under the collateral order doctrine, interlocutory
 orders must fall "in that small class [of orders] which finally
 determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to,
 rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review
 and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate
 consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated." 
Ass'n of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton, 68 Haw. 98, 105, 705
 P.2d 28, 34 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis
 added; quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S.

451, 546 (1949)); see also Abrams, 88 Hawai 'i at 321-22, 966 P.2d 
at 633-34 (regarding the three requirements for appealability 
under the collateral order doctrine). Thus, in a case where the trial court's task is to adjudicate the merits of causes of action, an order compelling arbitration qualifies an appealable order under the collateral order doctrine. 
For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i recently 
cited Swinerton in support of its holding that, under such circumstances, an "order compelling arbitration . . . is sufficiently 'final' under our collateral order doctrine to be appealable under the general civil matters appeal statute, HRS § 641-1 (Supp. 2005)." Unidev, 129 Hawaii 378, 380, 301 P.3d 
588, 590 (2013) (footnote omitted). In County of Hawai
'i v. 
Unidev, LLC, the main purpose of the case was to litigate two consolidated cases involving a complaint that "asserted five causes of action, including (1) false claims in violation of HRS § 46-171 (Supp. 2001), (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3) fraudulent inducement, (4) negligent misrepresentation, and (5) negligence" (id. at 381, 301 P.3d at 591 (footnote omitted)), a "counterclaim [that] asserted four counts, including (1) breach of contract . . ., (2) quantum meruit . . ., (3) intentional interference with contract . . ., and (4) fraudulent transfer" (id. at 381-82, 301 P.3d at 591-92), and a second complaint that "alleged causes of action for false claims pursuant to HRS § 46–171 (Count I), intentional misrepresentation (Count III), fraudulent inducement (Count IV), and negligent misrepresentation (Count V) . . . [and] Respondent also alleged a new cause of 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
action for unfair and deceptive practices (Count II), declaring 
that Petitioners violated HRS §§ 480–2 (1993) and 481A–3 (1993) by engaging in several acts." Id. at 382, 301 P.3d at 592. 
Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i held 
that, "under the collateral order doctrine, orders compelling arbitration are appealable final orders." Id. at 392, 301 P.3d 
at 602 (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted).

However, the circumstances in Unidev that warranted
 
invocation of the collateral order doctrine were very different
 from the circumstances in the instant case. In Unidev, the
 circuit court's task as the trier of fact in a standard civil
 case was to adjudicate multiple causes of action in two
 complaints and a counterclaim. In contrast, the instant case
 involved a special proceeding in which the circuit court's sole
 task as the trier of fact was to adjudicate the narrow issue
 whether a dispute was subject to binding arbitration. In the
 instant case, Claimants-Appellees Franciscan Villas LLC (Appellee
 Franciscan Villas) and Pacific Island Realty LLC (Appellee

 Similarly, the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals held that,
under the collateral order doctrine, "[a]n order granting a motion to compel
arbitration is final and appealable" under circumstances when such an order"is one of that small category of orders which finally determine claims ofright separable from and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, tooimportant to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself torequire that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case isadjudicated." Sher v. Cella, 114 Hawai' i 263, 266-67, 160 P.3d 1250, 1253-54
(App. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).In Sher, the parties were litigating a "complaint [that] contained six counts:(1) misrepresentation and non-disclosure, (2) breach of contract, (3) breachof duty of good faith and fair dealing, (4) negligence, (5) deceptive tradepractices, and (6) unjust enrichment." Id. at 266, 160 P.3d at 1253. Thus,
when the circuit court entered an order granting a motion to compelarbitration of these causes of action, the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals held that, under the collateral order doctrine, the "order granting[the] motion to compel arbitration is final and appealable[.]" Id. at 266-67, 
160 P.3d at 1253.

Pacific Island Realty) did not initiate their special proceeding 
in S.P. 13-1-0222 (KKS) by filing a complaint asserting causes of action, but, instead, by filing Appellee Franciscan Villas and Appellee Pacific Island Realty's April 29, 2013 motion to compel Appellant St. Francis Residential Care Community and St. Francis Healthcare System of Hawaii to participate in arbitration, which, in effect, defined the narrow purpose of this special proceeding. Appellee Franciscan Villas and Appellee Pacific Island Realty did not ask the circuit court to adjudicate the merits of any causes of action, but, instead, they asked the circuit court to adjudicate the narrow issue whether their dispute was subject to binding arbitration, and Appellee Franciscan Villas and Appellee Pacific Island Realty specifically prayed for an order compelling arbitration. Consequently, under the circumstances of the instant case, the December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration directly addresses the central merits of Appellee Franciscan Villas and Pacific Island Realty's April 29, 2013 motion to compel arbitration. Consequently, the December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration does not satisfy the requirement for the collateral order doctrine that the order must "resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action[.]" Abrams, 88 Hawai
'i at 322, 966 P.2d at 634 (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the December 10, 2013 order compelling arbitration is not an appealable order under the collateral order doctrine.

'i and the Hawai 'i
