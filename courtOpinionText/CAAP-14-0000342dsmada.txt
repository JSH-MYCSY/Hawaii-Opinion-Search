(By:

Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On January 10, 2014, Petitioner-Appellant Quintin-
John D'Agirbaud, III (Petitioner-Appellant), pro se, filed a
 notice of appeal;
 
(3) Appellant did not file either document;
 (4) On April 7, 2014, the appellate clerk informed 
Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 30, the matter would be called to the court's attention on April 17, 2014, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal. The record indicates the appellate clerk mailed a copy of the April 7, 2014 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
notice to Appellant at his address listed in the notice of appeal
 
and record on appeal, and no return mail was received; and 
(5) Thereafter, Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction and opening brief, or respond to the April 7, 2014
 notice. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
