William Eric Boyd (Boyd) both appeal from the "Decision and Order

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
And Decision And Order" (FOF/COL), entered February 8, 2013, that
 
found Boyd guilty of violating the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
chapter 84's Code of Ethics (Code of Ethics) violations. On
 
appeal, the Commission contends the circuit court erred in
 
reversing in part its FOF/COL, holding that Boyd was guilty of
 violating HRS § 84-14(d) (2012 Repl.) (Counts 10-20). On cross-
appeal, Boyd contends the circuit court erred in affirming in
 part the Commission's FOF/COL because (1) the Commission lacked
 appellate jurisdiction to bring charges against Boyd because Boyd
 was not a State employee; (2) the State violated its own
 procedural rules so as to violate Boyd's constitutional due
 process protections; (3) the Commission was not a fair and
 impartial tribunal so as to violate Boyd's constitutional due
 process protections; (4) the Commission failed to prove that Boyd
 violated HRS § 84-14(a) (Counts 1-9); and (5) the Commission's
 overall actions were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of
 discretion.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Purchase of School Materials
 
Boyd was an Administrative Assistant at Connections New
 
Century Public Charter School (Connections), a public charter
 
school created pursuant to HRS chapter 302B. As an employee of
 
Connections, Boyd was authorized to submit purchase order forms
 requesting that Connections purchase school materials.
 
Connections utilized a purchase procedure to obtain
 
supplies, material, and equipment for the school, which included
 use of a form the school developed for purchase requests
 (purchase order form). The purchase order form identified (a)
 
the name and title of the individual making the request
 
(requestor); (b) the name, address, and telephone number of the
 
individual or entity from whom the materials could be purchased
 
(vendor); (c) the school materials desired, including the
 
quantity and pricing; and (d) the name of the individual
 
approving the request. The requestor would enter the vendor's
 name, address, and telephone number on the purchase order form,
 then submit the purchase order form to an authorized Connections
 official for approval. Connection's Principal, John Thatcher
 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Principal Thatcher), had the final authority for approval of all
 
purchase requests. If Principal Thatcher was unavailable, Boyd
 
was authorized to preliminarily approve purchase orders, but all
 of Boyd's approvals were subject to final approval by Principal
 Thatcher, as indicated by Principal Thatcher's initials or
 signature on the purchase order form. The approval process also
 requires someone check the school's inventory to make sure the
 school did not have the requested material, check with vendors to
 find the best prices for the requested materials, and have the
 "Title 1 Coordinator" review and approve the order, if the
 purchase involved the use of Title 1 funds.
2
 
On September 12, 2006, February 9, 2007, April 2, 2007,
 
May 8, 2007, and June 29, 2007, Boyd prepared, signed as
 "Requestor," and/or approved various Connections purchase order
 forms to purchase school materials for the school.
 
On certain of the aforementioned purchase order forms,
 
Boyd wrote his wife's name, Erika Boyd (Erika), as the requestor
 
and also identified Erika as the vendor by writing her name on
 
the line captioned "Payable to:". On two of the purchase order
 forms, Principal Thatcher approved of the purchase order by
 signing on the line captioned "Approved." On all other forms,
 Boyd approved the purchase order and Principal Thatcher
 subsequently initialed the purchase order form to indicate his
 final approval. The school materials referenced on all purchase
 order forms were sold to Connections through Erika and were
 fulfilled by an Amway distributorship business that Boyd and
 Erika co-owned (Amway business).
B. Lunch Service Program
 
In 2007, Connections contracted with "Boyd Enterprises"
 
to provide school lunches to Connections' high school students. 
Boyd Enterprises was co-owned by Boyd and his wife, Erika, and
 also did business as "Tropical Dreams," "Tropical Dreams Ice
 Cream," and "Just Fabuloso."
 
2
 "Title 1 funds" are federal monies provided to schools with a high
level of poverty, and such funds may be used to supplement the school's
instructional program.
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As part of the procedure for obtaining payment for the
 
school lunches Boyd Enterprise provided, Boyd Enterprises
 
submitted invoices, titled a "Food Service Certificates," (Food
 
Service Certificate) to Connections that reflected the number of
 
school lunches provided to the school and the total cost owed to
 
Boyd Enterprises. Boyd Enterprises was required to submit to
 Connections a duly signed and certified Food Service Certificate
 before Connections could pay Boyd Enterprises for lunches
 provided to the school. Principal Thatcher had the authority to
 approve payments to Boyd Enterprises for Food Service
 Certificates. In the absence of Principal Thatcher, Sandra
 Kelley (Kelley), a school official at Connections, had the
 
authority to approve payment of the Food Service Certificates.
 
Boyd Enterprises, doing business as Tropical Dreams Ice
 
Cream, submitted several Food Service Certificates to Connections
 
reflecting that Boyd Enterprises provided a varying number of
 school lunches to the school. Boyd signed the Food Service
 Certificates on behalf of Boyd Enterprises as its "Food Service
 Manager," certifying that the lunches had been provided. Kelley
 signed the Food Service Certificates on the line captioned
 "School Official" on behalf of Connections. "Please make check
 payable to Erika Boyd" was on all but one of the Food Service
 Certificates.
 
On the following dates, Boyd, as a representative of
 
Boyd Enterprises, submitted the Food Service Certificates to
 Connections:
 
(1) January 25, 2007; Paid January 25, 2007;
 (2) February 1, 2007; Paid February 5, 2007;
 (3) February 9, 2007; Paid February 9, 2007;

C. Procedural History
 
In a Charge dated October 20, 2010, the Commission
 
formally charged Boyd with violating HRS § 84-14(a) and (d) of
 
the Code of Ethics. On November 22, 2010, Boyd filed an Answer
 to the Commission's Charge.
 
On April 18, 2012, the Commission issued its "Further
Statement of Alleged Violation" in furtherance of its original
 October 20, 2010 Charge against Boyd. The Commission's Further

 HRS § 84-14(a) violations, for requesting and approving the
 purchase of school materials from Boyd's Amway business, and
 eleven counts of HRS § 84-14(d) violations, for assisting Boyd
 Enterprises in transactions to provide lunches to Connections for
 compensation. The Commission's Further Statement of Alleged
 Violation charged the following:

On May 10, 2012, Boyd filed an Answer to the

 On July 5, 2012, the Commission issued a Notice of Hearing,
 granting Boyd's request for a contested case hearing.
 
On November 27 and November 28, 2012, the Commission
 
held hearings on the charges against Boyd. The Commission called
 Kelley and Boyd to testify. Boyd testified on his own behalf and
 called Principal Thatcher as a witness.
 
On February 8, 2013, the Commission filed its FOF/COL,
 
concluding that Boyd had "committed nine (9) violations of HRS
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 84-14(a) (Counts 1 through 9) and eleven (11) violations of HRS
 
§ 84-14(d) (Counts 10 through 20)." The Commission fined Boyd
 $500 for each violation committed, resulting in a total
 administrative fine of $10,000.
 
On February 15, 2013, Boyd filed a "Notice of Appeal to
 
Circuit Court," appealing the Commission's FOF/COL. On May 13,
 2013, Boyd filed his opening brief and argued that the Commission
 (1) violated his due process rights by violating the Commission's
 own procedural rules; (2) violated his due process rights to a
 fair and impartial tribunal; (3) lacked statutory jurisdiction
 over Boyd because Boyd was not a State employee; (4) failed to
 prove that Boyd intended to violate the Code of Ethics; (5)
 failed to prove that Boyd violated HRS § 84-14(a) (Counts 1-9);
 (6) failed to prove that Boyd violated HRS § 84-14(d) (Counts 10­20); and (7) acted "arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by
 abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
 discretion[.]" The Commission filed its answering brief on June
 25, 2013.
 
On October 7, 2013, the circuit court filed its Order,
 
affirming in apart and reversing in part the Commission's
 FOF/COL. The circuit court held that Boyd's due process rights
 were not violated during his hearing, that the Commission was a
 fair and impartial tribunal, and that the Commission did not
 abuse it discretion in regards to pre-hearing and hearing
 matters. The circuit court's Order also affirmed the
 Commission's determination that Boyd was a State Employee and
 that Boyd had violated HRS § 84-14(a)(1) (Counts 1-9). The
 circuit court, however, reversed the Commission's determination
 that Boyd had violated HRS § 84-14(d) (Counts 10-20) and held
 that the Commission failed to find that Boyd "received money in
 return for, or in exchange for, the act of signing the Food
 Service Certificates[,]" so to constitute "compensation" as
 defined under HRS § 84-3 (2012 Repl.). The circuit court entered
 its Final Judgment on December 16, 2013.
 
On January 14, 2014, the Commission filed a Notice of
 
Appeal. On January 16, 2014, Boyd filed a Notice of Cross-
Appeal.

9II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW
"On secondary judicial review of an administrative decision,
Hawaii appellate courts apply the same standard of review as
that applied upon primary review by the circuit court." 
Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor & Indus.
Relations, 70 Haw. 72, 80, 762 P.2d 796, 800-01 (1988).  For
administrative appeals, the applicable standard of review is
set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) (2004), which provides:
Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it
may reverse or modify the decision and order if
the substantial rights of the petitioners may
have been prejudiced because the administrative
findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
(1)In violation of constitutional or
statutory provisions; or
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or 
(6) Arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.  
Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g)(5), 
administrative findings of fact are
reviewed under the clearly erroneous
standard, which requires [the
appellate] court to sustain its
findings unless the court is left
with a firm and definite conviction
that a mistake has been made. 
Administrative conclusions of law,
however, are reviewed under the de
novo standard inasmuch as they are
not binding on an appellate court. 
Where both mixed questions of fact
and law are presented, deference
will be given to the agency's
expertise and experience in the
particular field and the court
should not substitute its own
judgment for that of the agency.  To
be granted deference, however, the
agency's decision must be consistent
with the legislative purpose.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The Commission had jurisdiction to bring charges against
Boyd.
 
The Commission charged Boyd with violating several
 
3
sections of the Code of Ethics, HRS § 84-14(a)  and HRS § 84­
4
14(d) , in his capacity as Administrative Assistant at
Connections. Boyd contends the Commission did not have
 jurisdiction to prosecute him because he was not an "employee" of
 the State and, thus, HRS chapter 84 did not apply to him. 
The purpose of HRS chapter 84, as put forth in the
 
preamble of the chapter, is three-fold: 
(1) prescribe a code of ethics for elected officers and
public employees of the State as mandated by the people of
the State of Hawaii in the Hawaii constitution, article XIV; 
(2) educate the citizenry with respect to ethics in
government; and 
(3) establish an ethics commission which will administer the
codes of ethics adopted by the constitutional convention and
by the legislature and render advisory opinions and enforce
the provisions of this law so that public confidence in
public servants will be preserved.
 
(Format altered.)
 
The Code of Ethics applies "to every nominated,
 
appointed, or elected officer, employee, and candidate to elected
 
3	 HRS § 84-14(a) provides in relevant part:
 
§ 84-14 Conflict of interest. (a) No employee shall
take any official action directly affecting:
 
(1)	 A business or other undertaking in which the
employee has a substantial financial interest;
or
 
(2)	 A private undertaking in which the employee is
engaged as legal counsel, advisor, consultant,
representative, or other agency capacity.
 
4
 HRS § 84-14(d) provides:
 
(d) No legislator or employee shall assist any person
or business or act in a representative capacity for a fee or
other compensation to secure passage of a bill or to obtain
a contract, claim, or other transaction or proposal in which
the legislator or employee has participated or will
participate as a legislator or employee, nor shall the
legislator or employee assist any person or business or act
in a representative capacity for a fee or other compensation
on such bill, contract, claim, or other transaction or
proposal before the legislature or agency of which the
legislator or employee is an employee or legislator.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
office of the State and for election to the constitutional
 
convention, but excluding justices and judges[.]" HRS § 84-2
 (2012 Repl.). "Employee" is defined as "any nominated,
 appointed, or elected officer or employee of the State, including
 members of boards, commissions, and committees, and employees
 under contract to the State or of the constitutional convention,
 but excluding legislators, delegates to the constitutional
 convention, justices and judges." HRS § 84-3. HRS § 84-1
 instructs that "[chapter 84] shall be liberally construed to
 promote high standard of ethical conduct in state government[,]"
 but does not specifically indicate whether charter school
 employees are "employees of the State" so as to be required to
 adhere to the Code of Ethics. 
1. Boyd is a State Employee.
 
Boyd appears to make two conflicting arguments as to 
why he was not required to abide by the Code of Ethics.  First, 
Boyd contends that at the time that his alleged violations 
occurred he was an employee of Connection's Local School Board (LSB), not the State of Hawai
'i. During the hearing before the 
Commission, Principal Thatcher also testified that Boyd "can be fired by the local school board[,]" "was hired by the local school board[,]" and was "under the jurisdiction of the local school board." 
At the time Boyd allegedly violated the Code of Ethics, 
charters schools were governed under HRS chapter 302B. "When the State legislature enacted HRS [c]hapter 302B, the Public Charter School chapter, the legislature described the charter school system as an 'important complement to the [DOE's] school system, one that empowers local school boards and their charter schools by allowing more autonomy and flexibility and placing greater responsibility at the school level." Waters of Life Local School 
Bd. v. Charter School Review Panel, 126 Hawai
'i 183, 187, 268 
P.3d 436, 440 (2011) (quoting 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 298, § 1 at 1200) (emphasis omitted). The legislature described the charter school system as being made up of the Board of Education, the Charter School Administrative Office, the Charter School Review Panel, and the individual charter schools. See id. 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citing 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 298, § 1 at 1200-01). In 
addition, the charter school system also includes the LSB, which is the governing body of the charter school, and the charter school itself. Id. at 188, 268 P.3d at 441. This court 
specifically held that "[a]s part of a State entity administratively attached to DOE, the LSB is considered an arm of the State." Id. at 189, 268 P.3d at 442. Boyd's argument that 
he is an employee of Connection's LSB, not the State of Hawai
'i, 
is therefore a distinction without a difference. Given that the LSB is an "arm of the State" and Boyd admits that he was employed by the LSB, Boyd was an employee of the State so as to be subject to the Code of Ethics. 
In addition, several other statutory provisions
 
specifically treat employees of charter schools as State
 employees. See HRS § 302B-10(b) (2007 Repl.) ("The State shall
 
afford administrative, support, and instructional employees in
 charter schools full participation in the State's system for
 retirement, workers' compensation, unemployment insurance,
 temporary disability insurance, and health benefits in accordance
 with the qualification requirements for each."); HRS § 302B-11
 (2007 Repl.) ("The department of human resources development
 shall administer workers' compensation claims for employees of
 charter schools, who shall be covered by the same self-insured
 workers' compensation system as other public employees."); HRS
 § 302B-9(d) (2007 Repl.) ("[A]s public schools and entities of
 the State, neither a charter school nor the office may bring suit
 against any other entity or agency of the State."); HRS
 § 89-10.55(a) (2012 Repl.) ("Employees of charter schools shall
 be assigned to an appropriate bargaining unit as specified in
 section 89-6[.]"). 
A review of the record indicates that Boyd participated
 
in many of the available benefits of being a State employee. He
 was enrolled in the State's Employee's Retirement System (ERS),
 
the State's Employer-Union Trust Fund (EUTF), and was a member of
 
a State bargaining unit. Boyd needed to be classified as a State
 
employee in order to receive those benefits. The term "employee"
 for purposes of HRS chapter 88 (Pension and Retirement Systems)
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
refers to "any employee or officer or the State or any county[.]" 
HRS § 88-21 (2012 Repl.). HRS § 88-42 (2012 Repl.) indicates
 that "all persons who . . . enter or reenter the service of the
 State or any county shall become members [of ERS] at the time of
 their entry or reentry." The record indicates that Boyd self-
identified as a State employee in order to qualify for ERS. On
 April 9, 2003, Boyd filed an ERS "Membership Enrollment Form" as
 a "Returning Member," meaning that he previously "terminated or
 resigned and after a break in service of at least 1 working day,
 [he was] now back in service." (Emphasis in original.) On the
 ERS form, he checked "Yes" next to the question "Are you
 currently employed by another State/County agency?" and indicated
 the "DOE - Education" as the department with which he was
 employed.
 
Boyd again self-identified as a State employee in April
 
27, 2005 in order to enroll in the State's EUTF program and
 obtain health insurance through his employment with the State.
 Under HRS § 87A-31 (2012 Repl.), the EUTF "shall be used to
 provide employee-beneficiaries and dependent-beneficiaries with
 health and other benefit plans[.]" "Employee-beneficiary"
 includes
 
"Employee-beneficiary" means:
 
(1) 	An employee;
 
(2)	 The beneficiary of an employee who is killed in the
performance of the employee's duty;
 
(3)	 An employee who retired prior to 1961;
 
(4)	 The beneficiary of a retired member of the employees'
retirement system; a county pension system; or a
police, firefighters, or bandsmen pension system of
the State or a county, upon the death of the retired
member;
 
(5)	 The surviving child of a deceased retired employee, if
the child is unmarried and under the age of nineteen;
or
 
(6)	 The surviving spouse of a deceased retired employee,
if the surviving spouse does not subsequently remarry;
 
provided that the employee, the employee's beneficiary, or the
beneficiary of the deceased retired employee is deemed eligible by
the board to participate in a health benefits plan or long-term
care benefits plan under this chapter.

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 87A-1 (2012 Repl.) (emphasis added). "Employee" is defined
 
as an "employee or officer of the State, county, or legislature"
 and does not exempt Charter Schools.
 
On a EUTF "Enrollment Form for Active Employees,"
 
signed and dated April 27, 2005, Boyd wrote his name under the
 section for "Employee's Last Name, First, M.I." Under a section
 that was for "State Employees ONLY (Premium Conversion Plan),"
 Boyd checked the box "Enroll," thus indicating that he self-
identified as a State employee. Boyd also checked the box that
 indicated he was a "State or County - Employee or Retiree."
 
In addition, the bottom of Boyd's EUTF enrollment form 
and a subsequent EUTF Confirmation Notice indicates that he was
 part of Bargaining Unit 03 in 2005 and remained in Bargaining
 Unit 03 in 2009. Under HRS § 89-10.55(a) and (b), "[e]mployees
 of charter schools shall be assigned to an appropriate bargaining
 unit as specified in section 89-6 [(2012 Repl.)]" and "[f]or the
 purpose of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement for
 charter schools employees who are assigned to an appropriate
 bargaining unit, the employer shall be determined as provided in
 section 89-6(d)."
 
HRS § 89-6(d) (2007 Supp.) provides:
 
(d) For the purpose of negotiating a collective
bargaining agreement, the public employer of an appropriate
bargaining unit shall mean the governor together with the
following employers:
 
(1)	 For bargaining units (1), (2), (3), (4), (9),
(10), (13), the governor shall have six votes
and the mayors, the chief justice, and the
Hawaii health systems corporation board shall
each have one vote if they have employees in the
particular bargaining unit[.]
 
(Emphasis added.) Therefore, Boyd's enrollment in an collective
 
bargaining unit establishes that, for bargaining purposes, the
 governor is considered his "public employer" and that Boyd is
 treated as a State employee.

 Boyd cites to HRS § 89-6(c) in support of his argument that the
LSB is his employer, not the State of Hawai' i. HRS § 89-6(c) provides: 
§ 89-10.55. Charter school collective bargaining;
bargaining unit; employer; exclusive representative.

  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Given that the LSB is a State entity, that statutory
 
provisions governing charter schools treat charter school
 
employees as State employees, and that Boyd self-identified as a
 State employee in order to obtain State benefits, we hold that
 Boyd was an employee of the State and was required to adhere to
 the Code of Ethics.
 
2.	 Charter school employees are not exempt from the Code
of Ethics requirements.
 
The second argument Boyd proffers in support of his
 
appeal is that charter schools are specifically exempt from the
 
Code of Ethics requirement. In support of Boyd's argument that
 he was not required to adhere to the Code of Ethics, Boyd cites
 to HRS chapter 302B (repealed effective June 19, 2012).
 Specifically, Boyd cites to the a 2011 amendment of HRS § 302B­7(f) that states that "Charter schools and their local school
 boards shall develop internal policies and procedures consistent
 with ethical standards of conduct, pursuant to chapter 84." HRS
 § 302B-7(f) (Supp. 2011). Boyd's reliance on the 2011 amended
 version of HRS § 302B-7(f) is misplaced because sub-section (f),
 dealing with charter school's ethical standards, was not placed
 into law until 2011, nearly four years after Boyd's alleged
 violations. 2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 130, § 5 at 341-42. Thus,
 the amended version of HRS § 302B-7(f), requiring that charter
 schools create their own internal ethical standards of conduct,
 was not in effect during the time the Commission contends Boyd
 violated Chapter 84 and is not applicable to this case on appeal.
 
See HRS §§ 1-3 (2009 Repl.); Clark v. Cassidy, 64 Haw. 74, 77,
 
636 P.2d 1344, 1346 (1981) ("It is an established rule that no
 
5(...continued)
(c) For the purpose of negotiating a memorandum of
agreement or a supplemental agreement that only applies to
employees of a charter school, the employer shall mean the
governing board, subject to the conditions and requirements
contained in the applicable sections of this chapter
governing any memorandum of agreement or supplemental
agreement.
 
As previously noted, the LSB remains an "arm of the State." Therefore, HRS
§ 89-10.55(c) in no way conflicts with our holding that Boyd is a State
employee. (Emphasis added.)

law has any retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed
 
or obviously intended." (Parenthesis omitted)). 
At the time of Boyd's alleged ethics violations, HRS
 
chapter 302B made no mention of Chapter 84, but did exempt
 charter schools from portions of several other statutes,
 including HRS chapters 76, 89, 91, 92, and 103D, but not HRS
 Chapter 84. HRS §§ 302B-7(d), -8(a), -9(a) (2007 Repl.). Boyd
 contends that by exempting charter schools from these statutory
 provisions, the legislature also intended to exempt charter
 schools from the Code of Ethics. Boyd's contention is not
 supported by canons of statutory construction. 
"It is well settled that a court's primary obligation 
in interpreting a statute is to give effect to the intent of the legislature." Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Wiig, 82 Hawai
'i 
197, 201, 921 P.2d 117, 121 (1996). "Under the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, 'the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another.'" Cnty. of Hawaii v. UNIDEV,

Int'l Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 82 Hawai 'i at 201, 921 P.2d at 121). 
"However, this canon applies 'only where in the natural association of ideas the contrast between a specific subject matter which is expressed and one which is not mentioned leads to an inference that the latter was not intended to be included within the statute.'" UNIDEV, 129 Hawai
'i at 389, 301 P.3d at 
599.
 
HRS § 302B-7 exempted charters schools from parts of
 
Chapters 91 ("Administrative Procedure"), 92 ("Public Agency

chapter 103D shall not constitute a waiver of the exemption

8
 HRS § 302B-9 provides:
 
§ 302B-9 Exemptions from state laws. (a) Charter
schools shall be exempt from chapters 91 and 92 and all
other state laws in conflict with this chapter, except those
regarding:
(1)	 Collective bargaining under chapter 89; provided
that:
 
(A)	 The exclusive representatives as defined
in chapter 89 and the local school board
of the charter school may enter into
supplemental agreements that contain cost
and noncost items to facilitate
 decentralized decision-making;
(B)	 The agreements shall be funded from the
current allocation or other sources of
 revenue received by the charter school;
provided that collective bargaining
increases for employees shall be allocated
by the department of budget and finance to
the charter school administrative office
 for distribution to charter schools; and
 
(C)	 These supplemental agreements may differ
from the master contracts negotiated with
the department;
 
(2)	 Discriminatory practices under section 378-2;
and
 
(3)	 Health and safety requirements.
 
(b) Charter schools and the office shall be
exempt from chapter 103D, but shall develop internal
policies and procedures from the procurement of goods,
services, and construction, consistent with the goals of
public accountability and public procurement practices.
Charter schools and the office are encouraged to use the
provisions of chapter 103D where possible; provided that the
use of one or more provisions of chapter 103D shall not
constitute a waiver of the exemption from chapter 103D and
shall not subject the charter school or the office to any
other provision of chapter 103D. Charter schools and the
 office shall account for funds expended for the procurements
of goods and services, and this accounting shall be
available to the public.
 
(c) Any charter school, prior to the beginning of the
school year, may enter into an annual contract with any
department for centralized services to be provided by that
department.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
procedural statutes and the Code of Ethics leads to an inference
 
that the latter was not intended to be included within the list
 of exempted statutes. Thus, Boyd's argument that it can be
 implied that the legislature intended charter schools to be
 exempt from the Code of Ethics requirements is without merit.
B.	 The Commission did not violate its own procedural rules so
as to violate Boyd's constitutional due process protections.
 
Boyd argues that the Commission violated his
 
constitutional due process rights because the Commission did not
 
follow its procedural rules found in HRS § 84-31(c) (2012

 
Repl.).9 Specifically, Boyd contends that "Section 84-31(c),
 
HRS, sets a twenty (20) day deadline to set a hearing following
 service of a Charge and a ninety (90) day deadline for the
 hearing to held [sic]" and the Commission failed to adhere to the
 deadline when it set Boyd's hearing "approximately one year and
 nine (9) months after the Charge was served on [him]." Boyd's
 interpretation of HRS § 84-31(c) as requiring the Commission to
 set a hearing within twenty days of service of the charge is
 without support from the statutory text.
 
HRS § 84-31(c) expressly provides
 
8(...continued)
public schools and entities of the State, neither a charter
school nor the office may bring suit against any other
entity or agency of the State.
 
9	 HRS § 84-31 provides in relevant part:
 
(c) If after twenty days following service of the
charge and further statement of alleged violation in
accordance with this section, a majority of the members of
the commission conclude that there is probable cause to
believe that a violation of this chapter or of the code of
ethics adopted by the constitutional convention has been
committed, then the commission shall set a time and place
for a hearing, giving notice to the complainant and the
alleged violator. Upon the commission's issuance of a notice
of hearing, the charge and further statement of alleged
violation and the alleged violator's written response
thereto shall become public records. The hearing shall be
held within ninety days of the commission's issuance of a
notice of hearing. If the hearing is not held within that
ninety-day period, the charge and further statement of
alleged violation shall be dismissed; provided that any
delay that is at the request of, or caused by, the alleged
violator shall not be counted against the ninety-day period.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(c) If after twenty days following service of the
charge and further statement of alleged violation in
accordance with this section, a majority of the members of
the commission conclude that there is probable cause to
believe that a violation of this chapter or of the code of
ethics adopted by the constitutional convention has been
committed, then the commission shall set a time and place
for a hearing[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Thus, the language of the statute indicates that the
 
Commission was to set a hearing no sooner than 20 days after
 
formally charging Boyd. The Commission filed its Charge against
 Boyd on October 20, 2010 and its Further Statement of Alleged
 Violation on April 18, 2012. The Commission then filed its Notice
 of Hearing on July 5, 2012. Therefore, the Commission waited over
 twenty days after filing its Charge and Further Statement of
 Alleged Violation against Boyd to file its Notice of Hearing, so
 as to comply with the statutory requirements found in HRS § 84­31(c). If the Commission had filed its Notice of Hearing within
 twenty days of filing its Charge and Further Statement of Alleged
 Violation, as Boyd suggests, it would have set Boyd's hearing
 before Boyd was required to submit an Answer to the Commission's
 allegations, pursuant to HRS § 84-31(b), and the Commission would
 have been in violation of HRS § 84-31(c). 
The Commission had six years from the time of the
 
alleged violation in which to file a charge for violations of HRS
 chapter 84. HRS § 84-31(a)(6) provides in relevant part:
 
(6)	 [The Commission] shall have jurisdiction for purposes
of investigation and taking appropriate action on
alleged violations of this chapter in all proceedings
commenced within six years of an alleged violation of
this chapter by a legislator or employee or former
legislator or employee. A proceeding shall be deemed
commenced by the filing of a charge with the
commission or by the signing of a charge by three or
more members of the commission.
 
The Commission alleges that Boyd committed several
 
violations of the Code of Ethics between September 12, 2006 and
 
June 21, 2007. On October 20, 2010, the Commission filed its
 first Charge against Boyd signed by four Commissioners. The
 Commission filed its Charge against Boyd within six years of
 Boyd's alleged violations, in compliance with HRS § 84-31(a)(6). 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, the statute of limitations had not expired and the
 
Commission had jurisdiction to charge Boyd for his violations.
C.	 The Commission did not violate Boyd's constitutional due
process protection to a fair and impartial tribunal.
 
Boyd contends the Commission "took on the simultaneous
 
roles of prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner in [Boyd's]
 
case and prejudged the case[,]" in violation of his due process
 right to a fair and impartial tribunal.
 
In Sifagaloa v. Bd. of Trustees of Employees' Ret. Sys. 
of State of Hawaii, 74 Haw. 181, 840 P.2d 367 (1992), the Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court noted that "a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process" and "applies to administrative agencies which adjudicate as well as to courts." Id. at 189, 840 
P.2d at 371 (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, as a general rule, "(1) legislative enactments are 'presumptively constitutional;' (2) 'a party challenging a statutory scheme has the burden or showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt;' and (3) the constitutional defect must be 'clear, manifest and unmistakable.'" Id. at 191, 840 P.2d at 371 
(brackets omitted). HRS § 84-31 grants the Commission the power to both investigate and hold hearings on allegations of Code of Ethics violations. HRS § 84-31 is, therefore, presumptively constitutional and Boyd carries the burden to overcome the presumption. See Sifagaloa, 74 Haw. at 191, 840 P.2d at 371. 
Boyd maintains the Commission was "inherently incapable
 
of being fair and impartial" because the commission played both
 an investigatory and adjudicatory role in Boyd's case. The
 Sifagaloa court held that "[a]n appearance of impropriety does
 not occur simply where there is a joinder of executive and
 judicial power." Id. at 191, 840 P.2d at 372. This is because
 
"[a]dministrators serving as adjudicators are presumed to be
 unbiased." Id. at 192, 840 P.2d at 372. The presumption can be
 
rebutted by a showing of disqualifying interest, such as a
 pecuniary or institutional interest in the outcome of the case. 
See id. (citing Wolkenstein v. Reville, 694 F.2d 35, 42 (2d Cir.
 1982)). However, "the burden of establishing a disqualifying
 interest rests on the party making the assertion." Id. 
20
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Boyd fails to allege that any Commission member
 
has a pecuniary or institutional interest in the outcome of his
 
case. Therefore, Boyd fails to overcome the presumption that HRS
 § 84-31 is constitutional and fails to overcome the presumption
 that the Commission was unbiased in its adjudication of his case.
D.	 The Commission was not required to prove that Boyd intended
to violate the Code of Ethics.
 
Boyd contends "[the Commission] was required to prove 
[Boyd] had actual knowledge of the applicable Chapter 84, HRS 
standards of conduct . . . and that he intentionally or knowingly violated those rules . . . ." (Emphasis in original.) The Commission held that Boyd had violated HRS § 84-14(a) and (d). Neither statutory provision, however, include intent or state of mind requirements. In fact, Hawai
'i courts have held that "a law 
takes effect upon its passage, and mere ignorance of the law constitutes no defense to its enforcement." Hirono v. Peabody, 
81 Hawai
'i 230, 234, 915 P.2d 704, 708 (1996) (holding that a 
candidate for governor's claim that he did not know he was constitutionally required to run with a lieutenant governor from the same party was no defense to his violation of the constitutional requirement); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Au, 107 Hawai
'i 327, 340, 113 P.3d 203, 216 (2005) (holding that 
lawyer's claims that "he was not aware that he was violating the [Hawai
'i Rules of Professional Conduct]" was no defense to his 
violation of the rules); In re Brandon, 113 Hawai 'i 154, 158, 149 
P.3d 806, 810 (App. 2006) (holding that pro se litigant's claims that he did not know "that the adjudication of a timely motion for reconsideration was a prerequisite for an appeal under HRS § 271-32(e) and HRS § 271-33" was no defense to the pro se litigant's failure to adhere to the requirement). Thus, Boyd's argument that he did not know that, as a State employee, he was required to abide by the Code of Ethics is no defense to the Commission's charges.
E. HRS § 84-14(a)(1) - Counts 1 to 9
 
Boyd claims that the Commission failed to prove that he
 
violated HRS § 84-14(a)(1) as alleged in Counts 1 through 9
 
because Principal Thatcher had final approval authority over the
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
purchases from Boyd's business for which Boyd prepared purchase
 
orders and/or preliminarily approved. We disagree.
 
There was substantial evidence to support the
 
Commission's finding that Boyd committed the violations of HRS 
§ 84-14(a)(1) as alleged in Counts 1 through 9. HRS § 84­14(a)(1) provides:
 
§ 84-14 Conflicts of interest. (a) No employee shall
take any official action directly affecting:
 
(1)	 A business or other undertaking in which the
employee has a substantial financial interest.
 
"Official action" is defined as "a decision, recommendation,
 
approval, disapproval, or other action, including inaction, which
 involves the use of discretionary authority." HRS § 84-3 (2012
 Repl.) (emphasis added). "Financial interest" is defined, in
 relevant part, as "an interest held by an individual, the
 individual's spouse, or dependent children which is: (1) An
 ownership interest in a business." Id. (format altered). 
The evidence showed that Boyd recommended that
 
purchases be made by Connections from Boyd's Amway distributor
 business by his actions in (1) preparing the purchase orders to
 order materials from his business and/or (2) granting preliminary
 approval for the purchases from his business. This evidence was
 sufficient to show that Boyd had taken "official action" by
 making recommendations involving the use of discretionary
 authority that Connections purchase materials from Boyd's own
 business. The evidence was also sufficient to show that Boyd's
 official actions directly affected his substantial financial
 interests. There was undisputed evidence that Boyd co-owned with
 his wife (as a sole proprietorship) the Amway distributor
 business from which Connections purchased the materials. 
Boyd relies on Tangen v. State Ethics Comm'n, 57 Haw.
 
87, 550 P.2d 1275 (1976), to support his claim that the
 Commission's proof was insufficient because Principal Thatcher
 had final approval authority over the purchases from Boyd's
 businesses. However, Tangen is distinguishable. 
For purposes of the conflict of interest provisions,
 
Tangen was considered to be a State employee as a member of the
 Land Use Commission (LUC), and he was also employed by the
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU). 
Tangen, 57 Haw. at 88-91, 550 P.2d at 1277-78. Tangen
 
participated in voting on petitions before the LUC brought by
 landowners to reclassify to urban districts parcels of land
 located within agricultural or conservation districts. Id. at
 
89, 550 P.2d at 1277. The lessees of the petitioning landowners,
 and in one case the landowner itself, had collective bargaining
 contracts with the ILWU. Id. However, the ILWU was not the
 
petitioner and did not own any interest in the lands sought to be
 rezoned in any of the cases before the LUC. Id. at 92, 550 P.2d
 
at 1279. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that Tangen's 
participation as a Land Use Commissioner in proceedings concerning the rezoning petitions did not violate the conflict of interest laws.
10 Id. at 93, 550 P.2d at 1279. The supreme court 
stated that it was undisputed that Tangen, as a Land Use Commissioner, was considered to be a State employee and that his "participation in the activities and proceedings of the State [LUC] in the disposition of [the rezoning] petitions constituted official action." Id. at 91, 550 P.2d at 1278. The supreme 
court concluded that the dispositive issue was whether Tangen's official action directly affected a business or matter in which Tangen had a substantial financial interest.
11 Id. 
In deciding this issue, the supreme court focused on
 
whether action by the LUC on the rezoning petitions would
 directly affect the ILWU, Tangen's employer.
12 The court found
 
it significant that "the ILWU was not the petitioner in these
 cases and did not own any interest in the lands sought to be
 
10
 Similar to HRS § 84-14(a)(1) at issue in this appeal, the
statute at issue in Tangen provided in relevant part: "'No employee
shall . . . (p)articipate, as an agent or representative of a state agency,
in any official action directly affecting a business or matter in
which . . . (h)e has a substantial financial interest.'" Tangen, 57 Haw.
 
at 90-91, 550 P.2d at 1278 (capitalization altered). 
11
 The supreme court noted that "[t]he usual and ordinary definition
of 'directly' is 'without any intervening agency or instrumentality or
determining influence.'" Id. at 92, 550 P.2d at 1279 (citation omitted). 
12
 The supreme court assumed that Tangen had a substantial financial
interest in the ILWU, as his employer. Id. at 92, 550 P.2d 1279.
 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rezoned by the State [LUC]." Id. at 92, 550 P.2d at 1279. In
 
holding that Tangen's actions as a Land Use Commissioner did not
 
directly affect his substantial financial interests as an
 employee of the ILWU, the supreme court reasoned:
 
Action by the State [LUC] concerning changes in the
classifications of land directly affects the petitioner who
seeks changes in authorized uses of the land. In our view
 the effect such an action would have on persons or
organizations other than the petitioner and those with
financial interest in the land affected by such petition
would be indirect, at the most. The agricultural workers
[who were members of the ILWU] employed by the lessees of
the landowners might be indirectly affected by the decisions
of the State [LUC] in the subject cases, but this effect
would turn not only upon the initial decision by the State
[LUC], but also upon the intervening decisions of the
landowners, i.e., to continue to lease their land for
agriculture or to develop the land in other ways, and the
intervening [decisions] of the lessee-employers in response
thereto, i.e., to relocate, to cease business, etc.
 
Id. at 93, 550 P.2d at 1279.
 
The supreme court's analysis in Tangen shows that its
 
focus was on the effect that the decision of the State entity
 
(the LUC) would have on the participating individual's financial
 interests. The court held that Tangen's actions as a Land Use
 Commissioner did not violate the conflict of interest law because
 only the petitioners were directly affected by the [LUC's]
 decision on the rezoning petitions -- the effect on Tangen's
 employer (the ILWU) was indirect because it did not turn only
 upon the decision by the State entity. The court in Tangen did
 not address the issue presented by this case, namely, whether the
 conflict of interest prohibition set forth in HRS § 84-14(a)(1)
 is inapplicable whenever another person has final approval
 authority over the State entity's decision. 
Unlike in Tangen, the effect of the decision by the
 
State entity (Connections) on Boyd's business was direct because
 it did not turn on any contingencies or intervening factors. 
Connection's decision on whether to purchase materials from
 Boyd's business directly affected Boyd's business. As a direct
 result of Connections' decision, in which Boyd was a significant
 participant, Boyd's business received money from Connections for
 the materials purchased. Boyd's interpretation of HRS § 84­14(a)(1) as being inapplicable whenever another person has final
 approval authority over the State entity's decision would render
 
24
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
superfluous the inclusion of the term "recommendation" in the
 
definition of "official action." Under Boyd's reading of HRS 
§ 84-14(a)(1), a person who participates in a State entity's
 decision by making a recommendation that is approved by another
 person could never violate HRS § 84-14(a)(1). 
We reject this reading because it contravenes a 
cardinal rule of statutory construction "that courts are bound, if rational and practicable, to give effect to all parts of a statute, and that no clause, sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found which will give force to and preserve all words of the statute." E.g., Coon v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 
98 Hawai
'i 233, 259, 47 P.3d 348, 374 (2002). We also reject 
this reading because it would create a significant loophole in the conflict of interest laws and lead to absurd and unjust results by exempting large categories of self-dealing by State employees. See Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 131 Hawai
'i 497, 508, 319 
P.3d 416, 427 (2014) (concluding that statutes should be construed to avoid "an absurd and unjust result obviously inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute"). Tangen did not analyze the phrase "directly affecting" under the circumstances presented by this case and did not address the inclusion of the term "recommendation" in the definition of "official action." 
We conclude that Tangen is distinguishable and does not
 
control our decision in this case. While there may be situations
 in which a State employee's participation through official action
 in the State entity's decisions is so minimal that it cannot be
 found to have directly affected the employee's substantial
 financial interests, this is not one of those situations. Boyd,
 through his official actions in recommending purchases from his
 own business, played a significant role in Connections' decisions
 to purchase materials from his business. We conclude that there
 was substantial evidence to support the Commissions'
 determination that Boyd committed the violations alleged in
 Counts 1 through 9.

F. HRS § 84-14(d) - Counts 10 to 20
 
The Commission found Boyd guilty of Counts 10 through
 
20, in violation of HRS § 84-14(d), for allegedly receiving
 
compensation for eleven separate transactions that he facilitated
 between Connections and Boyd Enterprises. The circuit court
 reversed the Commission's holding and held that "[t]he fact that
 Boyd may have received money from the transactions does not mean
 that he received 'compensation' as defined under HRS § 84-3."
 Specifically, the court rested its determination on the fact that
 the Commission made "no finding of fact that Boyd received money
 specifically in exchange for signing the Food Services
 Certificates."
 
In this appeal, the Commission contends the circuit
 
court erred because there was sufficient evidence in the record
 to support a finding that Boyd received compensation for signing
 the Food Services Certificates, so to violate HRS § 84-14(d). In
 response, Boyd reiterates the argument he made before the circuit
 court and contends the Commission provided insufficient evidence
 to support its conclusion that he received any compensation from
 signing the Food Service Certificates because all checks from
 Connections were made out to his wife, Erika.
 
HRS § 84-14(d) provides:
 
(d) No legislator or employee shall assist any person
or business or act in a representative capacity for a fee or
other compensation to secure passage of a bill or to obtain
a contract, claim, or other transaction or proposal in which
the legislator or employee has participated or will
participate as a legislator or employee, nor shall the
legislator or employee assist any person or business or act
in a representative capacity for a fee or other compensation
on such bill, contract, claim, or other transaction or
proposal before the legislature or agency of which the
legislator or employee is an employee or legislator.
 
HRS § 84-3 defines "compensation" as "money, thing of
 
value, or economic benefit conferred on or received by any person
 
in return for services rendered or to be rendered by oneself or
 another."
 
Boyd's claim that he was not culpable because he did
 
not personally receive any economic benefits is without merit. 
The record indicates that Boyd signed eleven Food Service
 Certificates, as a representative of Boyd Enterprises, so that
 
26
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Boyd Enterprises could be repaid for services rendered to
 
Connections. Boyd was the co-owner of Boyd Enterprises and
 therefore directly benefitted from payments made to Boyd
 Enterprises. The record further indicates, and Boyd does not
 dispute, that Connections did in fact pay Erika to settle the
 amounts owed to Boyd Enterprises. Therefore, Connection's
 payment to Erika constituted "compensation" to Boyd for which
 Boyd is culpable. 
In addition, the Commission was not required to find in
 
its FOF/COL that Boyd "received money specifically in exchange
 for signing the Food Services Certificates[,]" as the circuit
 court's Order suggests. "Where an appellant alleges that the
 trial court failed to make adequate findings of fact, the
 appellate court will examine all the findings, as made, to
 determine whether they are (1) supported by the evidence; and (2)
 sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues in the
 case to form a basis for the conclusions of law." Nani Koolau
 
Co. v. K & M Const., Inc., 5 Haw. App. 137, 140, 681 P.2d 580,
 584 (1984).
13 "If those findings include sufficient subsidiary
 
facts to disclose to the reviewing court the steps by which the
 lower court reached its ultimate conclusion on each factual
 issue, then the findings are adequate." Id.; see John Wilson
 
Enterprises, Ltd. v. Carrier Terminal Serv., Inc., 2 Haw. App.
 128, 130, 627 P.2d 294, 295 (1981); Tugaeff v. Tugaeff, 42 Haw.
 455, 467 (Haw Terr. 1958). 
First, the record and FOF/COL adequately supports a
 
finding that Boyd received "compensation" in exchange for signing
 the Food Service Certificates so that a further finding was not
 required. The signed Food Service Certificates constituted
 invoices that identified what services Boyd Enterprises rendered
 to Connections (i.e., providing school lunches) and how much
 money was owed to Boyd Enterprises for the services rendered. 
During the hearing before the Commission, Kelley specifically
 testified that the eleven check stubs made out to Erika reflect
 
13
 Although Boyd did not argue insufficiency of the findings of fact
below, the circuit court sua sponte held that the Commission's findings of
fact failed to support a determination that Boyd received "compensation" for
his services.
 
27
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
payment of the eleven Food Service Certificates that Boyd signed
 
on behalf of Boyd Enterprises. Thus the record indicates that in
 return for assisting Boyd Enterprises by signing the Food Service
 Certificates, Boyd received compensation in the form of payments
 to Boyd Enterprises (via checks made out to Erika) from which
 Boyd benefitted as the co-owner of Boyd Enterprises.
 
Second, the Commission's findings of fact were
 
sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to support the
 Commission's conclusion of law that Boyd had violated HRS § 84­14(d). The Commission's FOF/COL methodically laid out the facts
 that support a finding of Boyd's guilt as to each HRS § 84-14(d)
 violation. The Commission specifically found that

Given that the Commission's findings of fact were
 
supported by the record and sufficiently comprehensive to
 
disclose to the reviewing court the steps by which the Commission
 reached its ultimate conclusion on each factual issue, we hold
 that the Commission's findings of fact were adequate. Therefore,
 the circuit court erred in reversing in part the FOF/COL, as it
 pertains to Boyd's HRS § 84-14(d) violations.
G.	 The Commission did not behave arbitrarily, capriciously, or
abuse its discretion.
 
Boyd contends "[the Commission], through the actions of
 
its Chairperson, Maria Sullivan, acted in an arbitrary,
 
capricious and in a biased and prejudiced manner that was
 indicative of an abuse of discretion and clearly unwarranted
 
29
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
exercise of discretion." Boyd further contends that
 
"[a]ppellee's Chairperson had already made up her mind about the
 [Boyd's] guilt and made every effort to insure his conviction."
 Boyd cites to no legal authority and instead relies upon blanket
 accusations in support of his argument on appeal. Given our
 previous determination that the Commission was a fair and
 impartial tribunal, we hold that Boyd's argument that the that
 Commission "acted in an arbitrary, capricious and in a biased and
 prejudiced manner" towards him is without merit.
