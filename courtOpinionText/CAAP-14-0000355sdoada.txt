STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WILLIAM MCDONNELL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 13-1-0002)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Ginoza, J.;

and Reifurth, J., concurring)
  
Defendant-Appellant William McDonnell (
McDonnell)
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of
 
Entry (Judgment) filed on November 19, 2013 in the Family Court
 
1
of the First Circuit (Family Court).  Following a jury trial,
 
McDonnell was found guilty of Count I, Sexual Assault in the

 
First Degree (Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-730(1)(b)
 
(Supp. 2013)), and Counts IV-VI, Sexual Assault in the Third
 
Degree (HRS § 707-732(1)(b) (Supp. 2013)), and sentenced to a
 twenty-year term of imprisonment for Count I and concurrent
 five-year terms for Counts IV-VI. 
On appeal, McDonnell raises two points of error,

 
contending that: (1) Counts IV-VI should be vacated and remanded
 with instructions to dismiss because the indictment failed to
 allege that McDonnell was aware that the complainant was not

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
married to him, which is an essential element of Sexual Assault
 
in the Third Degree; and (2) the Family Court erred by allowing
 certain testimony from expert witness Dr. Alexander Bivens (Dr.
 
Bivens) which was improper under Hawai
'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
Rules 401, 402, 403, and 702.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve McDonnell's points of error as follows:
 
(1) 
Counts IV, V, and VI of the January 17, 2013
 
indictment against McDonnell state in relevant part:
 
COUNT IV:  On or about the 1st day of November, 2012, to and
including the 13th day of January, 2013 in the City and

County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, WILLIAM MCDONNELL,
being the parent or guardian or any other person having
legal or physical custody of K.M., did knowingly subject to
sexual contact, K.M., who was less than fourteen years old
or did cause K.M. to have sexual contact with WILLIAM
 MCDONNELL, by placing his hand on her buttock, thereby
committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the Third
Degree, in violation of Section 707-732(1)(b) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes.
 
. . . .
 
COUNT V:
 On or about the 1st day of November, 2012, to and
including the 13th day of January, 2013, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, WILLIAM MCDONNELL,
being the parent or guardian or any other person having
legal or physical custody of K.M., did knowingly subject to
sexual contact, K.M., who was less than fourteen years old
or did cause K.M. to have sexual contact with WILLIAM
 MCDONNELL, by placing his hand on her genitalia, thereby
committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the Third
Degree, in violation of Section 707-732(1)(b) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes.
 
. . . .
 
COUNT VI:
 On or about the 1st day of November, 2012, to and
including the 13th day of January, 2013, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, WILLIAM MCDONNELL,
being the parent or guardian or any other person having
legal or physical custody of K.M., did knowingly subject to
sexual contact, K.M., who was less than fourteen years old
or did cause K.M. to have sexual contact with WILLIAM
 MCDONNELL, by placing his hand on her breast, thereby
committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the Third
Degree, in violation of Section 707-732(1)(b) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes.
 . . . .
 
HRS § 707-732(1)(b) states that a person commits Sexual
 
Assault in the Third Degree when "[t]he person knowingly subjects
 
to sexual contact another person who is less than fourteen years
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
old or causes such a person to have sexual contact with the
 
person." "Sexual contact" is further defined as:
 
any touching, other than acts of "sexual penetration", of
the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married
 to the actor, or of the sexual or other intimate parts of
the actor by the person, whether directly or through the
clothing or other material intended to cover the sexual or
other intimate parts.
 
HRS § 707-700 (1993 & Supp. 2013) (emphasis added). 
During the trial court proceedings, McDonnell did not 
challenge the sufficiency of the indictment. Where the appellant 
alleges a charge is defective for the first time on appeal, an appellate court must "liberally construe the indictment in favor of validity[.]" State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 93, 657 P.2d 1019, 
1021 (1983); see also State v. Wells, 78 Hawai
'i 373, 894 P.2d 70 
(1995).  In such circumstances, a conviction will not be reversed 
"unless the defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime."  Motta, 66 
Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020. 
On appeal, McDonnell asserts for the first time that 
the indictment failed to allege all the essential elements of the 
offense charged. Specifically, McDonnell contends that Counts IV-VI of the indictment failed to allege the essential element that McDonnell was aware that the complainant was not married to him, rendering the charge deficient. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
has set out the four material elements of the offense of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree under HRS § 707-732(1)(b), one of which is "that [the defendant] was aware that the Minor was not married to him (i.e., the requisite knowing state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstance implicit in 'sexual contact,' . . .) [.]". State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai
'i 1, 15, 928 
P.2d 843, 857 (1996); see also State v. Muller, No. CAAP-10­0000225, 2014 WL 444230 (App. Jan. 31, 2014) (SDO), cert. rejected, No. SCWC-10-0000225, 2014 WL 1758391 (Haw. Apr. 29, 2014). 
Although McDonnell challenges the sufficiency of the
 
charge for the first time on appeal, for the same reasons this
 court articulated in Muller, McDonnell's conviction on Counts IV­
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
VI must be vacated and the case remanded for dismissal without
 
prejudice. As Muller explains:
 
Recently, in State v. Akitake, No. SCWC-29934 (Haw.
Jan. 10, 2014) (SDO), the Hawaii Supreme Court held in

similar circumstances, i.e. the defendant challenged the
charge for the first time on appeal, that because the charge
lacked an allegation of an attendant circumstance which was
an element of the offense, the charge failed to state the
subject offense. The majority in Akitake relied on State v.
Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 358, 311 P.3d 676, 681 (2013),
and stated in relevant part: 
As the charge lacked an allegation of anattendant circumstance, which is an element ofthe offense of OVUII, it failed to state theoffense of OVUII. Cf. State v. Apollonio, 130Hawai
'i 353, 358, 311 P.3d 676, 681
(2013)(dismissing without prejudice excessivespeeding complaint, the deficiency of which wasraised for the first time on appeal, becausecomplaint failed to allege mens rea, and couldtherefore not be construed to state the offense of excessive speeding). 
Akitake, SDO at *1. The relevant portion of Apollonio, in
turn, held that even under the liberal construction
standard, because the charge failed to allege the required
mens rea, the charge "cannot be reasonably construed to
state an offense." 130 Hawai'i at 358, 311 P.3d at 681
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
Here, Count II failed to allege an attendant
circumstance which was an element of the offense. Under the
 holdings and rulings in 
Apollonio  and Akitake, even though
Muller did not challenge the sufficiency of the charge until
this appeal, the charge "cannot be reasonably construed to
state an offense" and the conviction must be vacated.
 
Muller, 2014 WL 444230 at *2. 
In this case, Counts IV-VI failed to allege an
 
attendant circumstance which was an element of the offense and,
 
for the reasons stated above, the conviction on these counts must
 be vacated.
 
(2) 
The Hawaii Supreme Court has previously 
recognized the danger of unfair prejudice when allowing expert
 witness testimony in child sex abuse cases, saying:
 '
We are cognizant that cases involving allegations of
child sexual abuse are difficult to prove, but they are
equally difficult to defend against. Courts must proceed
with caution in admitting expert testimony in these cases.
The trial court must be satisfied that the witness is indeed
 an expert and that the testimony is relevant. The testimony
must further be shown to assist the jury to comprehend
something not commonly known or understood. And experts may
 
4

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
not give opinions which in effect usurp the basic function
of the jury.
 
State v. Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 562, 799 P.2d 48, 53-54 (1990). 
In the same case, the supreme court also recognized the

 
importance of expert testimony in such cases to dispel commonly
 held misconceptions regarding child victims of assault:
 
Child victims of sexual abuse have exhibited some
 
patterns of behavior which are seemingly inconsistent with
behavioral norms of other victims of assault. Two such
 types of behavior are delayed reporting of the offenses and
recantation of allegations of abuse. Normally, such
behavior would be attributed to inaccuracy or prevarication.
In these situations it is helpful for the jury to know that
many child victims of sexual abuse behave in the same
manner. . . .
 
Thus, while expert testimony explaining "seemingly
bizarre" behavior of child sex abuse victims is helpful to
the jury and should be admitted, conclusory opinions that
abuse did occur and that the child victim's report of abuse
is truthful and believable is of no assistance to the jury,
and therefore, should not be admitted. Such testimony is
precluded by HRE Rule 702. 
Id. at 557-58, 799 P.2d at 51-52 (citations omitted).
 
Here, McDonnell objects to Dr. Bivens's testimony
 
regarding the behavior of child victims of sex abuse and the
 
behavior and characteristics of child molesters, arguing:
 
The Circuit Court erred in allowing Bivens to testify
2
under HRE Rule 702,  because his testimony (1) was
irrelevant; (2) did not assist the jury in comprehending or
understanding something not commonly known or understood;
(3) improperly bolstered KM's credibility, and (4)
improperly profiled McDonnell as a child molester. The
 Circuit Court also erred in allowing Bivens to testify
because his testimony was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial
3 4 5
 
 under HRE Rules 401,  402, and 403.  
2 HRE Rule 702 provides: "If scientific, technical, or other
specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence
or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in
the form of an opinion or otherwise. In determining the issue of assistance
to the trier of fact, the court may consider the trustworthiness and validity
of the scientific technique or mode of analysis employed by the proffered
expert."
 
3
 HRE Rule 401 provides: "Relevant evidence means evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be
without the evidence."
 
4
 HRE Rule 402 provides: "All relevant evidence is admissible,
except as otherwise provided by the Constitutions of the United States and the
(continued...)

McDonnell argues that testimony regarding the
 
phenomenon of delayed reporting is irrelevant because "this case
 
did not involve delayed reporting in any significant way" since
 K.M. reported the November 2012 incident to her mother and a
 friend the day after it occurred and reported the final January
 2013 incident to her counselor the following day. However, while
 K.M. reported two of the alleged incidents soon after they
 occurred, she testified as to other alleged assaults that took
 place between November 20, 2012 and January 13, 2013 that were
 not immediately reported, including McDonnell touching her breast
 while she was using the computer, giving her a "sexual hug",
 
digitally penetrating her vaginally and anally, taking nude
 
pictures of her, and putting his mouth on her vagina. Dr.
 Bivens's testimony was relevant and helpful to understand why
 such abuse might not be reported immediately. 
Batangan,  71 Haw.
 
at 557, 799 P.2d at 51-52 (in situations where there is delayed
 reporting, "it is helpful for the jury to know that many child
 victims of sexual abuse behave in the same manner."). 
McDonnell also challenges the relevance of Dr. Bivens's

 
testimony regarding child memory of sexual abuse and recantation
 saying that neither are at issue in the present case. However,
 McDonnell does not point to any place in the record where Dr.
 Bivens testified about recantation and we find no such testimony. 
As to memory, McDonnell contends that testimony regarding child
 memory did nothing to assist the jury in "ascertaining truth in
 relevant areas outside the ken of ordinary laity" since Dr.
 Bivens testified that the way a child remembers sexual assault is
 not necessarily different from the way people like police
 officers and war veterans remember traumatic events. We

'i, by statute, by these rules, or by other rules adopted by the
supreme court. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible." 
5
 HRE Rule 403 provides: "Although relevant, evidence may be
excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence.
 
6
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disagree.  Dr. Bivens provided helpful descriptions of how a
 
child could experience a sort of "tunnel memory" where he or she
 
may recall the event well but not other peripheral details. This
 is relevant in this case where K.M. apparently gave different
 accounts as to the date of the initial abuse as it gives the jury
 context to evaluate her behavior "where the normal indicia of
 reliability might not apply." See State v. Transfiguracion, No.
 
CAAP-11-0000048, 2012 WL 5897413 at *4 (App. Nov. 21, 2012)
 (SDO), cert. rejected, No. SCWC-11-0000048, 2013 WL 1285112 (Mar.
 28, 2013). We also reject McDonnell's argument that "even if
 delayed reporting or recantation had been at issue, there was no
 reason to conclude that such phenomena are still 'outside the ken
 of ordinary laity' over twenty years after Batangan was decided." 
See id. at *2.
 
McDonnell argues that Dr. Bivens's testimony that a 
large percentage of child sex abuse victims acted as K.M. did "usurped the function of the jury" by bolstering K.M.'s credibility. First, under Hawai
'i law, expert testimony which 
tends to bolster the credibility of a witness is not necessarily inadmissible, but "conclusory opinions that abuse did occur and that the child victim's report of abuse is truthful and believable is of no assistance to the jury, and therefore, should not be admitted." Batangan, 71 Haw. at 558, 799 P.2d at 52. 
Here, however, Dr. Bivens did not give an opinion as to the credibility of K.M. or any other witness. In fact, Dr. Bivens did not testify, as asserted by McDonnell, that a large percentage of child sex abuse victims acted as K.M. and, instead, told the jury he was not aware of the facts of the case. Thus, Dr. Bivens's 
testimony did not improperly bolster K.M.'s testimony or usurp 
the function of the jury. Transfiguracion, 2012 WL 5897413 at 
*2, see also State v. Kony, No. CAAP-12-0001114, 2014 WL 812997 at *2 (App. Feb. 28, 2014) (SDO), cert. granted, No. SCWC-12­0001114, 2014 WL 3513030 (July 15, 2014). 
For these reasons, we conclude it was not error for the
 
court to allow Dr. Bivens to testify about delayed reporting or
 child memory. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Bivens also testified regarding two studies on the
 
completeness of child victims' initial disclosures. One study,
 
which involved several hundred college students who were molested
 as children, found that about seventy-five percent gave very
 vague, general descriptions of what had happened to them when
 they first reported their abuse. The other study involved eleven
 children who had been sexually abused and found that they
 initially reported roughly half the number of incidents and also
 half the severity of incidents that actually occurred.
 
McDonnell's counsel objected to this testimony as
 
prejudicial, arguing that there is no evidence that K.M.'s
 initial disclosures may have been incomplete.
6 "[T]he issue of
 
incomplete disclosure fits with delayed reporting and
 inconsistency in that it provides the jury with context to
 evaluate the behavior of the minor complainants where the normal
 indicia of reliability might not apply." Transfiguracion, 2012
 
WL 5897413 at *4. We conclude that the Family Court did not err
 in admitting the testimony regarding incomplete disclosure
 because it was relevant and not overly prejudicial.
 
After the first incident, K.M. told her mother "my dad
 
had touched me that night."
7 K.M. testified that after this
 
disclosure, she did not tell her mother about any other incidents
 because "I thought she wouldn't do anything." K.M. also described
 a time between the November and January incidents when she
 thought her mother had observed McDonnell abusing K.M. When her
 mother asked what was going on, K.M. lied and said nothing
 happened because "I didn't want to see my mom sad." K.M. did not
 disclose again until January 2013 when she told her counselor
 that the abuse had been ongoing for several months because "I
 knew she'd do something about it." Dr. Lee testified that during
 his examination of K.M., she reported that there had been more
 
6
 McDonnell had previously sought to exclude Dr. Bivens testimony in
a motion in limine and stated that he was renewing his previous objections to
Dr. Bivens' testimony. 
7
 Due to a hearsay objection made by defense counsel, K.M.'s mother
was unable to testify specifically as to what K.M. had disclosed during this
conversation. K.M.'s friend did not testify at trial.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
than 20 separate incidents. Taking this testimony as a whole, we
 
conclude that the evidence shows K.M.'s initial disclosures were
 incomplete.
 
Dr. Bivens testified that in their initial disclosures,
 
child abuse victims often give very vague, general descriptions
 "when in fact it may have been much more elaborate than that." 
Relatedly, as to delayed disclosures, Dr. Bivens explained that
 children often have difficulty disclosing because "they expected
 to be blamed, that they were embarrassed, that they didn't want
 to upset anybody, and that they expected not to be believed." 
Dr. Bivens's testimony is helpful in understanding not only
 K.M.'s silence after first disclosing to her mother, but also why
 she may not have described any details of the abuse initially. 
Moreover, because Dr. Bivens told the jury he did not know the
 facts of the case, and because the State did not imply that
 McDonnell committed any other assaults in addition to what K.M.
 testified to during trial, Dr. Bivens did not opine that K.M. was
 underreporting the abuse. Thus, we conclude that the Family
 Court did not err in finding this testimony relevant and did not
 abuse its discretion in concluding that the admission of Dr.
 Bivens's incomplete reporting testimony was not substantially
 more prejudicial than probative. 
Finally, McDonnell contends that Dr. Bivens's
 
"testimony regarding typical child molesters and the abuse
 process amounted to improper profile evidence, and any minimal
 probative value that this evidence had was substantially
 outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the
 issues, and misleading the jury." In support of his argument,
 McDonnell cites to cases outside of this jurisdiction wherein
 courts have held that evidence about typical sex offender
 behavior was inadmissible. See, e.g., Hall v. State, 692 S.W.2d
 
769 (Ark. Ct. App. 1985), State v. Hansen, 743 P.2d 157 (Or.
 1987), State v. Claflin, 690 P.2d 1186, 1190 (Wash. App. 1984),
 State v. Petrich, 683 P.2d 173, 180 (Wash. 1984), State v. Maule,
 667 P.2d 96, 99 (Wash. App. 1983). We also note the dissent to
 the rejection of certiorari in State v. Transfiguracion, No.

SCWC-11-0000048, 2013 WL 1285112 at *9, 12 (Mar. 28, 2013) (SDO)
 
(Acoba and Pollack, JJ., dissenting), which would have held, in
 another child sex abuse case in which Dr. Bivens testified, that
 Dr. Bivens's testimony about the "abuse process" and "grooming
 process" was inadmissible as profile evidence which was
 substantially more prejudicial than probative. Id. 2013 WL
 
1285112 at *6 (footnote and citations omitted).
 
However, this court has consistently held that Dr.
 
Bivens's testimony regarding characteristics of child molesters,
 i.e., the "abuse process" is admissible. See, e.g., Kony 2014 WL
 
812997 at *2-3, State v. Pacheco, No. CAAP-11-0000571, 2012 WL
 5990275 at *1-2 (App. Nov. 30, 2012) (SDO), Transfiguracion, 2012
 WL 5897413 at *3-4, State v. Behrendt, No. 29191, 2009 WL 3653563
 at *2 (App. Nov. 4, 2009) (SDO). Here, evidence of the "abuse
 process" was relevant to explain that a child may delay reporting
 because the molester has normalized the abuse. After outlining
 the ways in which a child molester will start the abuse process,
 Dr. Bivens was asked, "What do the studies show about how a child
 can be coerced to willingly participate in the sexual acts?" He
 replied, "We simply know that the children will, you know - will
 frequently acquiesce to what the molester is doing and they will
 tend to go along with it." Further, testimony that "probably
 
eighty percent of the time there's not any real physical force
 
involved[,]" and "eighty-five percent of the time . . . the child
 has a pre-existing nonsexual relationship with their molester[,]"
 was relevant to dispel notions that most child molesters are
 strangers or abductors. Batangan, 71 Haw. at 557-58, 799, P.2d
 
at 52. ("Expert testimony exposing jurors to the unique
 interpersonal dynamics involved in prosecutions for intrafamily
 child sexual abuse may play a particularly useful role by
 disabusing the jury of some widely held misconceptions so that it
 may evaluate the evidence free of the constraints of popular
 myths.") (citations, internal quotation marks, ellipses, and
 brackets omitted).
 
In addition, McDonnell noted that "it is staggering how
 
closely Bivens' testimony about typical child abuse cases matched
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and highlighted the State's other evidence against McDonnell[,]"
 
and argued that "Bivens' testimony about the 'abuse process' and
 typical child molesters unduly prejudiced McDonnell because it
 shifted the jury's focus from properly evaluating KM's
 credibility to instead determining 'whether the evidence against
 [him] matched the evidence in the usual case involving sexual
 abuse of a young child.'" "Thus, it created an unwarranted
 presumption that McDonnell was a child molester because he
 engaged in certain behaviors . . . that were as likely to be
 innocent as incriminating." However, we have previously rejected
 the argument that "if the alleged behavior of a defendant in a
 sexual abuse case involving a minor is consistent with the
 findings of general scientific studies on child molesters, then
 expert testimony on those studies is impermissible. Such a
 proposition is inconsistent with the controlling case law of this
 jurisdiction." Transfiguracion, 2012 WL 5897413 at *3 (citation
 
omitted). Furthermore, Dr. Bivens did not profile McDonnell as a
 sex offender. As stated, he told the jury he did not know the
 facts of the case. He also made it clear that there is not a
 profile "to a typical child molester", saying: 
I want to emphasize it is not possible to look at a person,
look at their demographic characteristics, or even their
personality characteristics and determine whether or not
they're a child molester. Child molesters are defined by
the child molestation behavior itself, not by any sort of
profiling evidence or anything like that.
 
Also, during closing, the State "merely referenced Dr.
 
Bivens' testimony to explain the progression of abuse that
 
developed between [McDonnell] and [KM]." Behrendt, 2009 WL
 
3653563 at *2. Thus, we conclude that the Family Court did not
 abuse its discretion when it allowed Bivens' testimony.
 
For these reasons, the Family Court's November 19, 2013
 
Judgment is affirmed as to Count I, and vacated as to Counts IV­
