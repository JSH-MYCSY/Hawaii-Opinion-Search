LEO LAPKUNG SETO,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHARLES LEGG III,
Defendant-Appellant
and
 
DOLORES WATTS, JOSHUA M. HUBBS, JOHN DOES,
Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC 13-1-597K)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Pro se Defendant-Appellant Charles Legg III (Legg)
 
appeals from the "Judgment for Possession" (Judgment) and "Writ
 
of Possession" (Writ) both entered on January 13, 2014 in the
 
District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona
 
1
Division  (district court). 
On appeal, Legg contends that he was not served with
 
"lawful due process" and therefore the Judgment and Writ entered
 
against him constitute a "void court order of a void judgment."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
1
 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo Jr. presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Legg's
 appeal is without merit.
 
Legg's opening brief does not meet the requirements of 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b). Legg's 
opening brief lacks a concise statement of the case with citation to the record; a concise statement of the points of error that clearly identifies the alleged error and includes record cites to reflect where the error occurred; a Standard of Review section; or an argument section containing citations to authorities or parts of the record. See HRAP Rule 28(b). Non-compliance with 
HRAP Rule 28 is sufficient grounds to dismiss Legg's appeal. See 
HRAP Rule 30 ("When the brief of an appellant is otherwise not in conformity with these rules, the appeal may be dismissed . . . ."); see also Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) However, in light of 
Legg's pro se status, we will address his arguments where they can be reasonably discerned. See Wagner v. World Botanical 
Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai
'i 190, 193, 268 P.3d 443, 446 (App. 
2011). 
Legg contends on appeal that "no Law Full Due Process
 
was ever lawfully served on the Lawful Owner Charles B.
 Legg3
rd(III)" and thus, the district court had no jurisdiction over
 
him. Specifically, Legg contends the district court erred in
 entering default judgment against him because he was not provided
 notice of the hearings and was not provided an opportunity to
 present evidence of his ownership of the property at issue
 (Property).
 
"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due
 
process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is
 notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to
 apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and to
 afford them an opportunity to present their objection." Romero
 
v. Star Markets, Ltd., 82 Hawai
'i 405, 412, 922 P.2d 1018, 1025

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(App. 1996) (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.,
 
339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)). The requirement of reasonable notice
 is regarded as part of the due process limitations to the
 jurisdiction of a court. See id. Thus, "[t]o acquire
 
jurisdiction over the person, a court must serve on the person a
 document, 'such as a summons, notice, writ, or order.'" Id.
 
(quoting McGuire v. Sigma Coatings, Inc., 48 F.3d 902, 907 (5th
 Cir. 1995)).
 
Legg was served pursuant to District Court Rules of
 
Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 4(d)(1)(i), which states that
 
service shall be made
 
[u]pon an individual other than an infant or an incompetent
person, . . . by delivering a copy of the summons and the
complaint to that individual personally or in the case the
individual cannot be found by leaving copies thereof at the
individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with
some person of suitable age and discretion then residing
therein . . . .
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The "Return of Service; Acknowledgment of Service,"
 
(Return of Service) filed on November 8, 2013, states that on
 
November 7, 2013 at 5:10 p.m., "[a]fter due and diligent search
 
and inquiry, [the server] served the named party [Legg] through
 Dolores Watts [(Watts)] a person of suitable age and discretion
 
then residing at said party's usual place of abode, since the
 
party could not be found." The Return of Service indicates that
 Watts was given both the complaint and summons. In addition,
 Watts' affidavit indicates that she was born on July 29, 1930,
 considered herself of sound mind, and had resided at the Property
 since July 2006. On appeal, Legg does not dispute that the
 Property was his "usual place of abode" nor does he dispute that
 Watts was a "person of suitable age and discretion then residing
 therein." Accordingly, we accept as undisputed the facts
 contained within the Return of Service and hold that Legg was
 properly served under DCRCP Rule 4(d)(1)(i).
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 13, 2014
 
"Judgment for Possession" and January 13, 2014 "Writ of
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Possession," both entered in the District Court of the Third
 
Circuit, North and South Kona Division are affirmed.
