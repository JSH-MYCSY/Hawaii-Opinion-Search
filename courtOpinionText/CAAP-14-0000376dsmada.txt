EDWARD LARRY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
STEVE UYEHARA, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC07-1-001139)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Edward Larry's
 
(Appellant Larry) appeal from the Honorable Melanie Mito May's
 announcement in December 23, 2013 district court minutes that the
 district court intends to enter a written post-judgment order
 denying Appellant Larry's November 4, 2013 post-judgment motion
 pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the District Court Rules of Civil
 Procedure (DCRCP) to set aside the April 13, 2007 order granting
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendant-Appellee Steve Uyehara's (Appellee Uyehara) March 22,
 
2007 motion to dismiss Appellant Larry's complaint, because the
 district court has not yet reduced its announcement to a written
 post-judgment order that is filed in the office of the clerk of
 the district court, as Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) requires.
 
Appellant Larry is appealing pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang, 91 Hawai 'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 (emphases added). 
The April 13, 2007 order granting Appellee Uyehara's motion to 
dismiss Appellant Larry's complaint was an immediately appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) and Casumpang, 91 Hawai
'i, at 
426, 984 P.2d at 125, but no party asserted an appeal from the April 13, 2007 order that would have been timely under HRAP Rule 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
4(a)(1). Nevertheless, the April 13, 2007 order was, in effect, 
a "judgment" under DCRCP Rule 54(a), which defines a "judgment" as "any order from which an appeal lies." Therefore, all rulings that the district court might possibly enter after the April 13, 2007 order would be post-judgment orders. 
"A post-judgment order is an appealable final order 
under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
Thus, for example, in a civil circuit court case, "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a)." Id. at 160, 
80 P.3d at 981 (citation omitted). Nevertheless, the district court must reduce its adjudication of any post-judgment motion to a written order that the district court files in the office of the clerk of the district court in order to be an appealable post-judgment order. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) provides that "[a] judgment or order 
is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." A district court's "oral decision is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 
(2005). Although the court minutes might reflect a trial court's oral announcement of a ruling, "a minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 
88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) (emphasis 
added). "In civil cases before the district court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such 
entry." KNG Corp., 107 Hawai 'i at 77, 110 P.3d at 401 (citation, 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); cf. State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai
'i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 (2003) 
("Accordingly, we hold that, in order to appeal a criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)."). 
On March 17, 2014, the district court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000376,
 at which time the record on appeal did not contain any written
 post-judgment order that adjudicates Appellant Larry's
 November 4, 2013 post-judgment DCRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment
 motion to set aside the April 13, 2007 order granting Appellee
 Uyehara's March 22, 2007 motion to dismiss Appellant Larry's
 complaint. Absent the entry of an appealable, written post-
judgment order in the office of the clerk of the district court
 that adjudicates Appellant Larry's November 4, 2013 post-judgment
 DCRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment motion to set aside the April 13,
 2007 order granting Appellee Uyehara's March 22, 2007 motion to
 dismiss Appellant Larry's complaint, Appellant Larry's appeal is
 premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.
