NO. CAAP-14-0000377
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DISCOVER BANK, a Delaware corporation, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADFORD W. ADAMS and EIRAYNA K. ADAMS, Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC09-1-9133)
 
ORDER
 
(1) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
 
(2) DENYING AS MOOT ANY AND ALL PENDING MOTIONS
IN APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-14–0000377
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendants-Appellants
 
Bradford W. Adams and Eirayna K. Adams (the Adams Appellants)
 have asserted from the Honorable Michael K. Tanigawa's following
 three interlocutory orders:
 
(1) a December 9, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion for summary judgment;
 
(2) a December 9, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion to disqualify Judge Hilary
Benson Gangnes; and
 
(3) a December 20, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion for reconsideration of the
December 9, 2013 order denying the Adams
Appellants' motion to disqualify Judge Hilary
Benson Gangnes. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
2013) authorizes an appeal from a final order or final judgment
 
of a district court.
  
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals
are allowed in civil matters from all final
 
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and
district courts. 
In district court cases , a
judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . 
A final order means an order ending
the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished
. . . . When a written judgment,
order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all
parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is
final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai
'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases.
Consequently, an order that fully disposes of an
action in the district court may be final and
appealable without the entry of judgment on a
separate document, as long as the appealed order
ends the litigation by fully deciding the rights
and liabilities of all parties and leaves nothing
further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai
'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). In the instant case, the district court has 
not yet entered a final order or final judgment that ends this litigation by adjudicating all claims and leaving nothing further to be adjudicated. Absent a final order or final judgment that resolves all claims in this case, we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-1(a) and the holding in Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142.
 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist
 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the
 Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), none of the appealed interlocutory
 orders satisfy the requirements for appealability under the 
Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 
704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent a final order or final judgment that adjudicates
 
all of the parties' claims, the Adams Appellants' appeal is
 premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000377 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000377 are denied as
 moot.
