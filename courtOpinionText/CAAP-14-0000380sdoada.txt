Plea/Judgment filed on December 24, 2013 in the District Court of

 HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(1) provides in relevant part:
 
ยง291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty[.]

On appeal, Kaneshiro argues that the district court
 
erred in denying his motion to dismiss the Complaint on the
 
ground that it contains disjunctive language and therefore is
 defective.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kaneshiro's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
The district court did not err in denying the motion to 
dismiss the Complaint. Kaneshiro points to two parts in the Complaint where he contends that the use of "or" renders the Complaint defective.
3 However, these parts in the Complaint 
involve similar or analogous forms of conduct that are codified in a single subsection of a statute. Indeed, the relevant portions of the Complaint are worded disjunctively in the language provided by HRS ยง 291E-61(a)(1). This type of disjunctive charging is permissible. See State v. Codiamat, 131 
Hawai
'i 220, 227, 317 P.3d 664, 671 (2013); State v. Monroe, No. 
CAAP-13-0002124, 2015 WL 3936905, at *1 (App. June 25, 2015) (SDO).

 The Complaint states:
 
On or about the 4th day of July, 2013, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, [Kaneshiro] did
intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate or assume
 actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway while under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental
faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against
casualty; and/or did operate or assume actual physical
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or
highway with .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred
ten liters of breath, thereby committing the offense of
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
violation of Section 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) of the
[HRS]. [Kaneshiro] is subject to sentencing as a first
offender in accordance with Section 291E-61(b)(1) of the
[HRS].
