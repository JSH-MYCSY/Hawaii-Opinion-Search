IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ARTHUR TAKEI, Defendant-Appellant

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

HONOLULU DIVISION

(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-04017)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

Defendant-Appellant Arthur Takei appeals from the

Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed

on December 27, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit,

Honolulu Division ("District Court").
1 The District Court

dismissed without prejudice a September 23, 2013 Complaint

charging Takei with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an

Intoxicant ("OVUII"), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes

§ 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (3). On appeal, Takei argues that the
 
District Court's decision to dismiss the case without prejudice

was erroneous, and specifically that it was error to do so

without issuing findings of fact in support. 
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced, the issues raised, and the relevant

statutory and case law, we resolve Takei's points of error as

follows:

The State concedes that the District Court erred in 
failing to issue findings of fact and maintains that the case 
should be remanded on that basis, but it argues that the court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the case without prejudice. The State's concession notwithstanding, "appellate courts have an independent duty 'first to ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the record and well-founded in law and second to determine that such error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'" State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai
'i 219, 
221–22, 74 P.3d 575, 577–78 (2003) (quoting State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)). In other words, the 
State's concession of error "is not binding upon an appellate court[.]" Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502 (quoting 
Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The District Court based its dismissal on the State's 
inability to comply with the speedy-trial time limits set forth in Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 48. Therefore, 
in evaluating whether the District Court erred in dismissing the charge without, rather than with prejudice, we apply the standards for dismissals under HRPP Rule 48. In State v. Hern, 133 Hawai
'i 59, 64, 323 P.3d 1241, 1246 (App. 2013), this court 
held that "in determining whether to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under HRPP Rule 48(b), the trial court must not 
2
only consider the Estencion factors,  but must also clearly
 
articulate the effect of the 
Estencion factors and any other

factor it considered in rendering its decision." (Footnote

added.)

In the instant case, the District Court did not state

any reason in writing—whether in findings of fact or

otherwise—for its decision to dismiss the charge without

2/

The "Estencion factors" are: "[(1)] the seriousness of the
offense; [(2)] the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the
dismissal; and [(3)] the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of
[HRPP Rule 48] and on the administration of justice." Hern, 133 Hawai' i at 
63, 323 P.3d at 1245 (App. 2013) (brackets in original) (footnotes omitted)(quoting State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981))
(internal quotation marks omitted).

prejudice.3 Therefore, the record on appeal is inadequate to 
permit our meaningful review of the District Court's exercise of 
its discretion in dismissing the charge without prejudice. See 
Hern, 133 Hawai 'i at 65, 323 P.3d at 1247; see also State v. Yi, 
No. CAAP-13-0000083, 2013 WL 6223827 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 27, 2013) (vacating and remanding for entry of findings). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of

Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on

December 27, 2013, in the District Court of the First Circuit,

Honolulu Division is vacated and the case is remanded with

instructions that the District Court: (1) consider the Estencion

factors in determining whether to dismiss Takei's OVUII charge

with or without prejudice; and (2) make findings that clearly

articulate the effect of the Estencion factors and any other

factor considered in rendering its decision.

Rather, the District Court stated orally that its decision to
dismiss the complaint without prejudice was "based on the representations of
counsel" without identifying the representations that it relied upon.
