v.
DANNETTE GODINES, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
NORTH/SOUTH HILO DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DTC-13-000064)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Dannette Godines (Godines ) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on
December 27, 2013, in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
North/South Hilo Division (District Court).1  Godines was found
guilty under Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 431:10C-104 (2005),2
1  The Honorable Barbara T. Takase presided. 
2  HRS § 431:10C-104 provides:
§431:10C-104  Conditions of operation and registration of
motor vehicles.  (a) Except as provided in section
431:10C-105, no person shall operate or use a motor vehicle
upon any public street, road, or highway of this State at
any time unless such motor vehicle is insured at all times
under a motor vehicle insurance policy.
(b) Every owner of a motor vehicle used or operated at
any time upon any public street, road, or highway of this
State shall obtain a motor vehicle insurance policy upon
such vehicle which provides the coverage required by this
article and shall maintain the motor vehicle insuranceNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
for operating a vehicle without motor vehicle insurance.  
This case is currently on remand to us from the Hawai# i
Supreme Court.  When this appeal was initially before this court,
Godines requested waiver of her transcript costs under HRS § 802-
7 (2014).3  This court denied her request for waiver of
transcript costs on grounds that Godines was not a "criminal
defendant" as required by HRS § 802-7.  Godines proceeded with
her appeal without any of the District Court transcripts, and
stated her point of error as follows: 
[T]he trial Court committed reversible error when they [sic]
tried Appellant as a criminal defendant under [Hawai #i Rules
of Penal Procedure ( HRPP)] and [Hawaii Rules of Evidence
(HRE)], sending her directly to trial de novo, yet without
counsel, while the prosecutor maintained an active presence
throughout the entirety of the proceedings. The trial Court
did so in direct opposition to HRS § 291D-8 and the
governing [Hawaii Civil Traffic Rules ( HCTR)]. 
policy at all times for the entire motor vehicle
registration period.
(c) Any person who violates the provisions of this
section shall be subject to the provisions of section
431:10C-117(a).
(d) The provisions of this article shall not apply to
any vehicle owned by or registered in the name of any agency
of the federal government, or to any antique motor vehicle
as defined in section 249-1.
3  HRS § 802-7 provides:
§802-7  Litigation expenses.   The court may, upon a
satisfactory showing that a criminal defendant is unable to
pay for transcripts or witness fees and transportation, or
for investigatory, expert or other services, and upon a
finding that the same are necessary for an adequate defense,
direct that such expenses be paid from available court funds
or waived, as the case may be; provided that where the
defendant is represented by the state public defender or by
other counsel appointed by the court except for such other
counsel appointed by the court for reasons of conflict of
interest on the part of the public defender, the public
defender shall pay for or authorize payment for the same, if
the public defender determines that the defendant is unable
to pay for the same and that the same are necessary for an
adequate defense, and if there is a dispute as to the
financial ability of the defendant such dispute shall be
resolved by the court. In cases where other counsel have
been appointed by the court for reasons of conflict of
interest, the court may, upon the requisite showing of
inability to pay and a finding that such expenses are
necessary for an adequate defense as set forth above, direct
that such expenses be paid from available court funds or
waived, as the case may be.

In short, Godines argued that the District Court
committed reversible error by failing to adjudicate her case
pursuant to HRS Chapter 291D and the HCTR.  In a Summary
Disposition Order filed on December 21, 2015, we affirmed the
District Court and concluded that Godines's violation was not a
traffic infraction within HRS Chapter 291D.  State v. Godines ,
No. CAAP–14–0000384, 2015 WL 9465286, at *1-2 (Haw. App. Dec. 21,
2015) (SDO). 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court granted Godines' Application
for Writ of Certiorari on May 4, 2016.  State v. Godines , No.
CAAP–14–0000384, 2015 WL 9465286 (Haw. App. Dec. 21, 2015) (SDO),
cert. granted, No. SCWC–14–0000384, 2016 WL 2957416 (May 4,
2016). 
On August 5, 2016, the supreme court issued its 
Opinion, in which it held that: (1) this court correctly
determined that HRS Chapter 291D did not apply to Godines' case;
however (2) this court erred in denying Godines' request for
transcript costs on the basis that she was not a criminal
defendant under HRS § 802-7.  State v. Godines , 138 Hawai #i 243,
254, 378 P.3d 959, 970 (2016).
Thus, the supreme court remanded the case to this court
and instructed that we "consider Godines' request under HRS
§ 802–7 and determine whether she is entitled to waiver of her
transcript costs."  Id. at 253, 378 P.3d at 969.  The supreme
court instructed that we:   
consider two factors (1) whether Godines "is unable to pay
for transcripts . . . fees" and (2) whether the transcripts
"are necessary for an adequate defense." HRS § 802–7.
Pursuant to State v. Scott, to determine whether a
particular transcript is necessary, the ICA should consider
"(1) the value of the transcript to the defendant in
connection with the appeal or trial for which it is sought,
and (2) the availability of alternative devices that would
fulfill the same functions as a transcript." 131 Hawai #i
333, 340, 319 P.3d 252, 259 (2013). If the two factors are
satisfied, Godines' transcript costs should be waived, and
her appeal should proceed accordingly. See id. at 345, 319
P.3d at 264 ("Although the language of HRS § 802–7 suggests
that the court has discretion ['[t]he court may, upon the
requisite showing ....'] to direct that transcript expenses
are paid, the balance of the pertinent statutory language
indicates that once a satisfactory showing of need for the
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
transcripts and inability to pay has been made, the court
should direct that such expenses be paid, unless alternative
means for timely obtaining the transcripts are available.").
Id.
On September 20, 2016, we issued an "Order Upon Remand
From the Hawai #i Supreme Court," which ordered Godines to submit
a further motion on her request for waiver of transcript costs
within thirty (30) days.  The order also permitted
Plaintiff–Appellee State of Hawai #i (State) to file a response to
Godines' motion. 
On October 26, 2016, Godines filed her "Further Motion
on Respondent's [Appellant's] Request for Waiver of Transcript
Cost" (Motion to Waive Transcript Costs).  The State did not file
a response. 
On February 14, 2017, this court filed an Order
granting Godines' Motion to Waive Transcript Costs that: directed
that fees for transcripts requested by Godines be paid from
available court funds or waived; ordered the court reporters to
prepare and file the requested transcripts; and set a
supplemental briefing schedule. 
Following this court's February 14, 2017 Order, the
transcripts for the six proceedings requested by Godines were
filed in the record.
Thereafter, Godines requested an extension of time to
file her supplemental opening brief and then requested a further
extension of her supplemental opening brief, asserting that
certain transcripts in the record contain "alterations and
omissions."  We permitted Godines to file a motion specifying the
basis for her claim regarding the transcripts and suspended the
supplemental briefing schedule.  We later remanded the case on a
temporary basis to the District Court to allow Godines to address
her concerns about the transcripts.  
On January 31, 2018, we filed an "Order Re-Setting
Supplemental Briefing Schedule" which stated in part:
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1)  Since this case was remanded to this court by the
Hawai#i Supreme Court's Judgment on Appeal filed on August
31, 2016, we have set several deadlines for supplemental
briefing by the parties;
(2)  We initially set the deadline for Defendant-
Appellant Dannette Godines (Godines) to file her
supplemental opening brief by May 15, 2017, but based on a
request from Godines we extended the deadline to May 30,
2017;
(3) Godines subsequently asserted that transcripts
filed in the record contain alterations and omissions
warranting a further extension of the supplemental briefing
schedule, and we suspended the supplemental briefing
schedule to address her asserted issues with the
transcripts;
(4)  On October 31, 2018,[4] we temporarily remanded
the case to the District Court of the Third Circuit to allow
Godines to file a motion specifying the corrections or
modifications she claims are needed to the transcripts; and
(5) The District Court Clerk's Certificate, filed on
January 23, 2018, certifies that there were no filings in
the District Court case during the temporary remand.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  
(A) The supplemental briefing schedule is re-set such
that:
(i)Appellant Godines shall file a 
supplemental opening brief by March 2, 2018; 
(ii) Appellee State of Hawai i (State) shall
file a supplemental answering brief within thirty (30)
days after service of Appellant Godines' supplemental
opening brief;#
(iii) Appellant Godines may file a supplemental
reply brief within fourteen (14) days after service of
the State's supplemental answering brief;
(B) No further extensions shall be granted to
Godines absent extraordinary circumstances;
(C) Any further requests for extensions shall be
made by motion filed with the court pursuant to Rule 29(b)
of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure.
(Emphasis added and footnote omitted).
Godines failed to timely file a supplemental 
opening brief by the March 2, 2018 due date.
On March 8, 2018, the appellate clerk issued a "Default
of Opening Brief" informing Godines that the time for filing the
supplemental opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai #i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 30, the matter would be
called to the court’s attention on March 19, 2018, for such
action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal.  
4  "October 31, 2018" contains a typographical error and should instead
state "October 31, 2017."  
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The default notice further advised Godines that "[a]ny request
for relief from this default should be made by motion. See HRAP
Rules 26 and 27." 
On March 19, 2018, Godines filed a letter addressed to
an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Governor Ige,
Chief Justice Recktenwald, and Chief Judge Nakamura (Ret.). 
Despite Godines' apparent allegations in her letter that
transcripts provided to her by order of this court were somehow
altered or omitted, she does not contest that she failed to seek
any relief when this court ordered a temporary remand to the
District Court to allow her to seek relief regarding her concerns
about the transcripts.
Godines has not filed the supplemental opening brief,
has not provided good cause or extraordinary circumstances for
her failure to timely file her supplemental opening brief, and
has not filed a motion seeking an extension of time pursuant to
HRAP Rule 29(b).  
The supreme court's Opinion concluded that if on remand
we determined that Godines was entitled to payment of transcripts
from court funds, "the transcripts shall be included in the
record on appeal, and the ICA should allow for supplemental
briefing on issues other than those related to HRS Chapter 291D." 
138 Hawai #i at 254, 378 P.3d at 970.  On remand, we determined
that Godines was entitled to the transcripts and the transcripts
were included in the record on appeal.  Further, consistent with
the supreme court's Opinion, we allowed for supplemental briefing
on issues other than those related to HRS Chapter 291D.  However,
Godines has failed to file supplemental briefing, and thus, has
not raised any issue beyond those raised in her initial briefs,
which were addressed in our prior Summary Disposition Order.
In light of these circumstances, for the reasons set
forth in our Summary Disposition Order filed on December 21,
2015, and given the Hawai #i Supreme Court Opinion filed on August
5, 2016, Godines has failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief
in this appeal.
