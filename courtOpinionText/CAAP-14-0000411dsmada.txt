OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
FLORENCE E. DELA CRUZ, ANASTACIA A. DELA CRUZ and
JENNIFER M. RESPECIO, Plaintiffs-Appellants,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1089-05)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiffs-
Appellants Florencia E. Dela Cruz, Anastacia A. Dela Cruz, and
 Jennifer M. Respecio's (the Appellants) have asserted from the
 following two interlocutory orders that the Honorable Karen T.
 Nakasone entered:
 
(1) a December 2, 2013 order denying the Appellants'
motion for a default judgment against Defendant-
Appellee Irene B. Quemado (Appellee Irene Quemado)
and, instead, dismissing all of the Appellants
claims as to Appellee Irene Quemado; and
 
(2) a January 3, 2014 order denying the Appellants'
motion for reconsideration of the December 2, 2013
order.

As explained below, these two interlocutory orders will 
be eligible for appellate review only by way of a timely appeal 
from a future final judgment that resolves all claims against all parties, because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v. Szymanski, 
107 Hawai
'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Adam, 97 Hawai 'i 475, 
482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) ("As a general rule, an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." (Citations omitted).). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2013 authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai 'i 14, 20, 122 
P.3d 809, 815 (2005) ("[A]n order disposing of a circuit court 
case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." (Citation omitted; emphasis added)). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that, "[a]lthough 
RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal of claims for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corporation, 81 Hawai
'i 171, 176, 914 
P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) (emphasis added)). When interpreting the requirement under HRCP Rule 58 for a separate judgment document that, on its face, resolves all claims against all parties, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i noted that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a 
judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 
P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
On March 25, 2014, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000411,
 which does not include an appealable final judgment that resolves
 all claims against all parties. Absent an appealable final
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate 
jurisdiction. 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

P.2d 576, 588 (1995) (citation, internal quotation marks, and
 ellipsis points omitted; emphasis added); Peterson v. Hawaii
 Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 Hawai
'i 322, 326, 944 P.2d 1265, 
1269 (1997), superseded on other grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp.
 1999); Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai
'i 
64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0000411 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
