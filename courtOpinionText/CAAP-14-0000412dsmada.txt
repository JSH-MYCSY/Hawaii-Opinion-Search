Upon consideration of "Plaintiff-Appellee Continental
 
Pacific, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Appeal" (Motion to Dismiss) and
 
the papers in support, filed on June 18, 2014 by Plaintiff-
Appellee Continental Pacific, LLC by their Managing Agent Elite

Angel A. Adversalo (Adversalo), Donna L. Shlachter (Shlachter), 
Jazzareah Nicole Reynon (Reynon), Rodney Molia Salanoa (Salanoa), Allan Dayle Tejada (Tejada), Milton Patrick Caulford (Caulford),

and Lynne Lagua (Lagua) (collectively, Appellants);  and the
2
files and record herein,  the Motion to Dismiss is granted.
On January 27, 2014, the District Court of the First

 
Circuit (district court) issued a "Memorandum of Decision and
 Order as to Summary Possession." On January 30, 2014, the
 
district court entered Judgments for Possession and Writs of
 Possession against Appellants and in favor of Appellee.  On
 
February 2, 2014, Appellants filed a notice of appeal through
 
which they appeal from the Judgments for Possession. 
Although the Judgments for Possession did not resolve 
all the claims in the underlying cases, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
has recognized an exception to the finality requirement under the Forgay doctrine. See Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848); 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). 
Under the Forgay doctrine, "[w]e have jurisdiction to consider 
appeals from judgments which 'require immediate execution of a 
command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if

 In addition to arguing that the appeal should be dismissed on
mootness grounds, Appellee asserts in its Motion to Dismiss that the Cabans
and Reynon have agreed in writing to dismiss their respective appeals.
Appellants' Opposition states that the Cabans, Reynon, Caulford, Lagua, and
Salanoa are excluded from the appeal, subject to the condition that Appellee's
counsel provide Appellants' counsel with the entire dismissal agreements.

 We note that Appellee filed a reply to Appellants' Opposition on
August 1, 2014. However, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 27
does not authorize a reply, and Appellee did not seek permission of this courtto file a reply. We therefore will not consider Appellee's reply in decidingthe Motion to Dismiss.

appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the
 
litigation.'" Ciesla, 78 Hawai 'i at 20, 889 P.2d at 704 
(citation and brackets omitted). For this appeal, however, we
 conclude that the appeal must be dismissed because it is moot. 
In Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Haw. 1, 5,
 
193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated: 
It is well-settled that:
 
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the
circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a
suit previously suitable for determination. Put
 another way, the suit must remain alive throughout the
course of litigation to the moment of final appellate
disposition. Its chief purpose is to assure that the
adversary system, once set in operation, remains
properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate where
events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties
that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on
appeal -- adverse interest and effective remedy -­have been compromised.
 
Lathrop [v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, 312–13, 141 P.3d 480,
485–86 (2008)] (citations omitted) (format altered); see 
also In re Doe Children, 105 Hawai' i 38, 57, 93 P.3d 1145,
1164 (2004) (stating that "the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal [are] adverse interest andeffective remedy"). 
"A case is moot if it has lost its character as a
 
present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts
 
are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law." 
Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Grp. v. Lyman , 69 Haw. 81, 87, 734 P.2d
 
161, 165 (1987) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation
 omitted). Further, "a case is moot if the reviewing court can no
 longer grant effective relief." Kaho
'ohanohano v. State, 114 
Hawai'i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007) (internal quotation 
marks, brackets, emphasis, citation, and block quotation format
 omitted).
 
In this case, it is undisputed that Appellants have all
 
vacated their respective properties. In addition, with the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
exception of Adversalo and Shlachter, Appellants signed documents
 
in which they agreed to vacate their respective properties in
 exchange for Appellee's agreement to, among other things, forgo
 seeking attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the summary
 possession proceedings. We note that Appellants argue that
 Tejada's agreement was subsequently invalidated for various
 reasons. 
However, regardless of the validity of the agreements

 
to vacate, Appellants have vacated their respective properties
 and it appears that the writs of possession were not executed. 
"The termination of possession without execution of a writ of
 possession moots all questions about the validity of the order
 authorizing the issuance of the writ of possession and of the
 writ itself." Crown Properties, Inc. v. Financial Sec. Life Ins.
 
Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985). 
Furthermore, Appellants' leases have terminated, and
 
Appellants have not demonstrated an entitlement to regain
 possession based on their leases, even if this court were to
 vacate the Judgments for Possession. Accordingly, this appeal is
 moot. See Exit Co Ltd. P'ship v. Airlines Capital Corp., Inc., 7
 
Haw. App. 363, 366, 766 P.2d 129, 131 (1988) (determining in a
 summary possession case that an appeal from a judgment for
 possession is moot where the appellant legally cannot regain
 possession of the subject premises, i.e., the Lease is "not
 subject to renewal or extension," should the judgment for
 
-4­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
possession be vacated by the appellate court).3
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss is
 
granted. The appeal in No. CAAP-14-0000412 is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
 
dismissed as moot.

 To the extent that the Cabans, Reynon, and other
Appellants have entered into agreements with Appellee to dismiss
their respective appeals, such agreements provide an additional
ground as to those Appellants for dismissing the appeal.
