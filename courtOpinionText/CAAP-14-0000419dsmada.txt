OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MICHAEL EDWARD MILLER,
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant,
and
 
JOHN CHESTER ANDERSON and PETER LESTER ANDERSON,
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/Appellees,
v. 
WAIOLI CORPORATION, a Hawaii Corporation, et al.,
Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 95-0132)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff/
 
Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Michael Edward Miller (Appellant
 Miller) has asserted from the Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe's
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
January 7, 2014 judgment, because the January 7, 2014 judgment 
does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original emphasis). 
The January 7, 2014 judgment does not expressly enter
 
judgment against anyone. Despite that HRCP Rule 54(a) warns that
 "[a] judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the
 report of a master or the record of prior proceedings[,]" the
 January 7, 2014 judgment needlessly lists fourteen prior orders
 and a settlement agreement that led up to the entry of the
 January 7, 2014 judgment. More importantly, however, although
 this case involves multiple original plaintiffs (some of whom
 were apparently substituted without any written order by the
 circuit court), numerous defendants, and multiple claims through
 a complaint, a four-count counterclaim and a four-count cross-
claim, the body of the January 7, 2014 judgment 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
•	 does not specifically identify all the parties in
favor of whom and against whom the circuit court
intends to enter judgment, and
 
•	 does not specifically identify the claim or claims
on which the circuit court intends to enter
 judgment.
 
Furthermore, although this case involves multiple claims
 
including a complaint, a four-count counterclaim and a four-count
 cross-claim, the January 7, 2014 judgment neither expressly
 dismisses the other claims on which the circuit court apparently
 does not intend to enter judgment, nor does the January 7, 2014
 judgment contain an express finding of no just reason for delay
 in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all
 claims or parties, as HRCP Rule 54(b) requires for a judgment
 such as the January 7, 2014 judgment that does not resolve all
 claims. A judgment must contain either (a) operative language
 (and not references to past dispositive orders) that
 affirmatively adjudicates all of the parties' claims or (b) an
 express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of
 judgment as to one or more but fewer than all specifically
 identified claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b).
 
The January 7, 2014 judgment does not satisfy the
 
requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641­1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an
 appealable final judgment in this case, Appellant Miller's appeal
 is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate
 court case number CAAP-14-0000419. Therefore,
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000419 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
