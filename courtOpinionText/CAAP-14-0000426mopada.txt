APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 11-1-2095 AND 12-1-1758)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This case involves competing claims to foreclose on the 
same property located in Mililani, Hawai 'i (the Property) by 
Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of New York Mellon, fka Bank of New York, 
not in its Individual Capacity, but Solely as Trustee (BNYM) and Defendant-Appellant R. Onaga, Inc. (Onaga Inc.). The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) consolidated the competing claims for foreclosure and granted summary judgment for BNYM, determining that BNYM held the first priority lien and could foreclose on the Property (Foreclosure Judgment). 
The Foreclosure Judgment was the subject of a separate
 
appeal before this court in CAAP-13-0002287. In CAAP-13-0002287,
 we vacated the Foreclosure Judgment in a Summary Disposition
 Order issued on September 18, 2014, and remanded the case to the
 circuit court. Bank of New York Mellon v. R. Onaga, Inc., No.
 
CAAP-13-0002287, 2014 WL 4661972, (Haw. App. Sept. 18,
 2014)(SDO).
 
In the instant appeal, which was pending when we issued 
the September 18, 2014 SDO in CAAP-13-0002287, Onaga Inc. appeals from a February 21, 2014 Judgment issued by the circuit court
1 
pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) 
(Judgment Confirming Sale), following an "Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees, Costs, and Directing Conveyance." (Order Confirming Sale).
2 On appeal, Onaga Inc. contends that the 
1 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided, except as noted below.
 
2
 Onaga Inc.'s notice of appeal identifies the Order Confirming Sale,
not the Judgment Confirming Sale. Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rules 3(c)(2) and 4(a)(2), we treat Onaga Inc. as having
timely appealed from the Judgment Confirming Sale.
Onaga Inc. also purports to appeal from the "Order Denying
Defendant R. Onaga, Inc.'s Motion for an Order to Void Amended Judgment Filedon September 6, 2013 and the Amended Notice of Entry of Judgment FiledSeptember 26, 2013" (Order Denying Motion to Void Judgment) filed on December12, 2013, in the circuit court. "An order denying a motion for post-judgmentrelief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under [HawaiiRevised Statutes (HRS)] § 641-1(a)." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 160,
(continued...)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
circuit court erred in (1) concluding it has subject matter
 
jurisdiction in BNYM's judicial foreclosure action; (2)
 confirming BNYM's foreclosure sale; and (3) denying Onaga Inc.'s
 motion for stay of proceedings pending appeal.
 
Additionally in this appeal, Intervenors Lyle Anthony
 
Ferrara and Linda Susan Ferrara (the Ferraras), the high bidders
 at the foreclosure auction, have filed a "Motion to Dismiss the
 Appeal and [Request] for Judicial Notice." The Ferraras contend
 that the Property has irretrievably passed to them and Onaga
 Inc.'s appeal is moot.
 
For the reasons set forth below, we take judicial
 
notice of the documents proffered by the Ferraras, including a
 certificate of title, but hold that the Ferraras have not
 demonstrated that Onaga Inc.'s appeal is moot. 
Further, in terms of Onaga Inc.'s points of error: (1)
 
because the Foreclosure Judgment was vacated by this court in
 CAAP-13-0002287, the Judgment Confirming Sale must also be
 vacated; and (2) because Onaga Inc. requested a stay pending
 appeal, it was required to post a supersedeas bond pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 62(d) to obtain the stay.
I. Background
 
Both BNYM and Onaga Inc. initiated separate foreclosure
 
proceedings in the circuit court on the Property owned by Robert
 
2(...continued)
80 P.3d 974, 981 (2003). The circuit court's Order Denying Motion to Void
Judgment was an appealable final post-judgment order.
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires Onaga Inc. to have filed its notice of
appeal from the Order Denying Motion to Void Judgment within thirty-days of
entry. The order was entered on December 12, 2013. The thirtieth day was
Saturday, January 11, 2014. Pursuant to HRAP Rule 26(a), the deadline for
Onaga Inc. to appeal from the Order Denying Motion to Void Judgment was
January 13, 2014. Onaga Inc. filed its notice of appeal on February 10, 2014.
"As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of the timely
filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional[.]" Ditto, 103 Hawai' i at 157,

and Marlyn Marquez (the Marquezes).3 The Marquezes' title was 
recorded in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land 
Court of the State of Hawai 'i (Land Court), Certificate No. 
794004. In their respective complaints, BNYM (Civ. No. 11-1­2095-09) and Onaga Inc. (Civ. No. 12-1-1758-12) both sought to foreclose on the Property, apply the proceeds of the sale to their respective liens as first priority liens, and have all other interests or liens adjudicated as subordinate. 
BNYM asserts that it has a first priority lien based on
 
a note and mortgage executed by the Marquezes. BNYM claims the
 Marquezes executed and delivered to Castle & Cooke Mortgage, LLC,
 a promissory note in the amount of $720,400, and executed and
 delivered to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.
 (MERS) as nominee, a mortgage encumbering the Property. The
 mortgage is alleged to have been recorded in the Land Court (Doc.
 No. 3394749) on February 21, 2006. The note and mortgage were
 allegedly assigned to BNYM via an Assignment of Mortgage, which
 was recorded in the Land Court on March 31, 2011 (Doc. No.
 4061412).
 
Onaga Inc. asserts that it has a first priority lien on
 
the Property based on the following facts asserted in its
 complaint. In November 2003, the Marquezes secured payment on a
 promissory note for the purchase of Onaga Inc.'s assets via a
 mortgage on a condominium owned by the Marquezes. When the
 Marquezes purchased the Property, the Marquezes promised to
 substitute a mortgage on the Property for the mortgage on the
 condominium, but did not do so. Onaga Inc. filed suit in the
 circuit court for specific performance and a final judgment was
 entered in its favor on December 11, 2007. Onaga Inc. recorded
 
3
 On June 12, 2014, the Marquezes informed the court that they take no
position regarding the issues raised on appeal and did not file an answering
brief. On May 8, 2012, the Marquezes had received a bankruptcy discharge fromthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawai' i. 
Previously, on May 23, 2014, the Department of Taxation, State of
Hawai'i also informed the court that it takes no position with respect to the
issues raised on appeal and did not file an answering brief.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the final judgment in the Land Court on March 24, 2008 (Doc. No.
 
3725614). Pursuant to the final judgment, the Marquezes executed
 a new mortgage in favor of Onaga Inc. which was also recorded on
 March 24, 2008 in the Land Court (Doc. No. 3725614).
 
The circuit court granted Onaga Inc.'s motion to
 
consolidate the separate foreclosure proceedings.
4 On April 9,
 
2013, BNYM filed a "Motion for Summary Judgment for Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure." BNYM contended that there was no genuine issue of
 material fact that it held a valid first priority lien on the
 Property and it was entitled to conduct a foreclosure sale. On
 May 15, 2013, Onaga Inc. filed an opposition to BNYM's Motion and
 a Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree
 of Foreclosure. Onaga Inc. contended that there was no genuine
 issue of material fact that it held the first priority lien on
 the Property.
 
On July 3, 2013, the circuit court entered an "Order
 
Denying [Onaga Inc.'s] Cross Motion for Summary Judgment and For
 Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (Order Denying Onaga Inc.'s
 Cross Motion for Summary Judgment). On July 5, 2013, the circuit
 court entered (1) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 Granting [BNYM's] Motion for Summary Judgment For Foreclosure
 Against All Defendants and For Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure" (Order Granting BNYM's Motion for Summary Judgment);
 and (2) the Foreclosure Judgment. Onaga Inc. filed a timely
 notice of appeal from these three documents, which became case
 no. CAAP-13-0002287.
 
In the Order Granting BNYM's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment, the circuit court concluded that BNYM's lien had
 priority over any other lien and BNYM was entitled to foreclose
 on the Property and conduct a foreclosure auction. The circuit
 court also concluded that upon closing of the foreclosure sale,
 all other claims in the Property would be forever barred and
 
4
 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe entered this order. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
foreclosed upon. On August 8, 2013, the circuit court entered an
 
"Amended Findings of Fact, Amended Conclusions of Law and Amended
 Order Granting [BNYM's] Motion for Summary Judgment for
 Foreclosure Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree
 of Foreclosure" and an amended order appointing Lorrin Kau as
 commissioner of the court.
 
On October 29, 2013, Onaga Inc. filed a "Motion For an
 
Order to Stay the Proceedings Pending Appeal Without Conditions
 or Bond" (Motion to Stay Proceedings) pursuant to HRCP Rule
 62(h). In its Memorandum in Support of Motion, Onaga Inc.
 reargued the merits of its case and noted that it appealed the
 Foreclosure Judgment, therefore the court should stay the
 proceedings without requiring Onaga Inc. to post a supersedeas
 bond or placing conditions on the stay. 
At a public auction held on November 5, 2013, the
 
Ferraras were the high bidders. On November 20, 2013, BNYM filed
 a "Motion for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, Approving
 Commissioner's Report, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees,
 Attorney's Fees, Costs, and Directing Conveyance."
 
On January 17, 2014, the circuit court entered the
 
Order Confirming Sale, which inter alia ordered the commissioner
 to make a good and sufficient conveyance of title to the Ferraras
 upon receipt of the full purchase price. On February 12, 2014,
 the circuit court denied Onaga Inc.'s Motion to Stay Proceedings
 and ordered Onaga Inc. to post a supersedeas bond in order to
 obtain a stay. On February 21, 2014, the circuit court entered
 the Judgment Confirming Sale.
A. CAAP-13-0002287 (Prior Appeal)
 
On July 24, 2013, Onaga Inc. appealed from the
 
Foreclosure Judgment, the Order Granting BNYM's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment, and the Order Denying Onaga Inc.'s Cross Motion
 for Summary Judgment, which became appellate case no. CAAP-13­0002287. On September 18, 2014, this court issued a Summary
 Disposition Order (SDO) which affirmed the Order Denying Onaga
 Inc.'s Cross Motion of Summary Judgment, but concluded that the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of
 
BNYM. Thus, this court vacated the Foreclosure Judgment and the
 Order Granting BNYM's Motion for Summary Judgment, and remanded
 to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the
 September 18, 2014 SDO. Bank of New York Mellon, 2014 WL
 
4661972, at *2.
 
Subsequently, on September 29, 2014, in CAAP-13­
0002287, the Ferraras filed a "Motion to Intervene and [Request]
 for Judicial Notice" and a "Motion: (1) For Reconsideration of
 the Summary Disposition Order, Filed on September 18, 2014, and
 (2) To Dismiss the Appeal." The Ferraras sought leave to
 intervene, asserting that Onaga Inc.'s appeal was moot prior to
 entry of the September 18, 2014 SDO because the Ferraras had
 finalized purchase of the Property on August 29, 2014, the day
 they purport to have recorded a Commissioner's Deed in the Land
 Court (Commissioner's Deed), and BNYM had not properly informed
 the court of this development. This court denied both of the
 Ferraras' motions. 
B. The Instant Appeal
 
On February 10, 2014, while the prior appeal in CAAP­
13-0002287 was still pending, Onaga Inc. filed the notice of
 
appeal in the instant case. On September 12, 2014, Onaga Inc.
 filed a motion for an injunction during the pendency of the
 appeal. On September 19, 2014, this court granted the motion due
 to the court's September 18, 2014 SDO in CAAP-13-0002287, and
 stayed the Order Confirming Sale during the pendency of this
 appeal.
 
On September 28, 2014, the Ferraras filed a "Motion to
 
Intervene and [Request] for Judicial Notice." On September 29,
 2014, the same day that the Ferraras filed their motions in CAAP­13-0002287, they filed a "Motion to Dismiss the Appeal" in the
 instant appeal raising the same contentions they raised in the
 motions filed in CAAP-13-0002287. As part of their motion to
 intervene, the Ferraras requested that judicial notice be taken
 of the Commissioner's Deed, recorded in the Land Court on August
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
29, 2014 (Doc. No. T-9006302), which they purport demonstrates
 
final transfer of title on the Property.
 
In an order issued on January 23, 2015, this court
 
granted the Ferraras' motion to intervene for the limited purpose
 of presenting their argument that the instant appeal is moot. We
 also took judicial notice of the Commissioner's Deed. In the
 same order, we denied the Motion to Dismiss the Appeal, stating: 
The Ferraras contend the appeal is moot because they
are good faith purchasers of foreclosed property and title
cannot be affected by the reversal of an order confirming
the sale after its recordation. However, the Ferraras do
not assert that a Certificate of Title has been issued, and
even if a Certificate of Title was issued, the Ferraras
would need to establish that there is no encumbrance noted
 on such Certificate of Title related to Appellant Onaga's
mortgage or his [sic] claims on the property. . . .
. . . .
 
The Ferraras have not established that the appeal is

moot.
 
On August 4, 2015, the Ferraras filed a second "Motion
 
to Dismiss the Appeal and [Request] for Judicial Notice" (Second
 
Motion to Dismiss) on grounds of mootness. The Ferraras request
 judicial notice of (a) a Certificate of Title, Certificate No.
 1083890, issued on August 29, 2014; (b) Commissioner's Deed,
 recorded August 29, 2014; and (c) a Mortgage recorded on August
 29, 2014, regarding the Property in which the Ferraras are listed
 as borrowers. The Ferraras reassert in their Second Motion to
 Dismiss that Onaga Inc.'s instant appeal is moot because title
 has irretrievably passed to the Ferraras, and, because they have
 provided a certificate of title, this court's concerns regarding
 priority of liens should be alleviated. We address the Second
 Motion to Dismiss in this opinion.
II. Discussion
 
A. The Ferraras' Motion to Dismiss the Appeal as Moot
 In the Second Motion to Dismiss, the Ferraras again
 
move to dismiss this appeal as moot and this time request
 judicial notice of the Commissioner's Deed, a Certificate of
 Title issued on August 29, 2014, and a Mortgage recorded in the
 Land Court on August 29, 2014.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1. Judicial Notice
 
"[A]n appellate court may take judicial notice of facts 
despite the failure of the trial court to do so, provided that 
the facts are capable of immediate and accurate demonstration by resort to easily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy." State v. Puaoi, 78 Hawai
'i 185, 190, 891 P.2d 272, 277 (1995) 
(citation and quotation marks omitted). The recording of the Commissioner's Deed and the Mortgage, and the issuance of the Certificate of Title, are facts that were not considered by the circuit court and were not included in the record on appeal because they occurred after the record on appeal was filed. However, Onaga Inc. does not dispute the accuracy of the documents, and the documents are easily accessible from a source of indisputable accuracy because they are records in the Land Court. Therefore, we take judicial notice of the Commissioner's Deed, Certificate of Title, and Mortgage proffered by the Ferraras. 
2. Certificate of Title
 
The Ferraras contend this appeal is moot. The Ferraras
 
argue that despite the September 18, 2014 SDO in CAAP-13-0002287,
 Onaga Inc. did not obtain a stay pending appeal and failed to
 post a supersedeas bond. Thus, the Ferraras contend, they were
 able to finalize the purchase and transfer of the Property on
 August 29, 2014, the day the Commissioner's Deed was recorded and
 the Certificate of Title was issued in the Land Court, which was
 prior to this court's issuance of the September 18, 2014 SDO. 
The Ferraras contend the sale cannot be undone. The Ferraras
 further contend that the recording of the Commissioner's Deed was
 sufficient to transfer title to them and warranted the issuance
 of the Certificate of Title, and that the Certificate of Title
 does not reflect any encumbrances relating to Onaga Inc.'s claims
 to the Property. 
In response, Onaga Inc. contends that the Certificate
 
of Title is void because the Land Court lacked statutory
 
9
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
authority to issue a new certificate of title in this case.5
 
Onaga Inc. contends that because this case involved a
 
"foreclosure by action," the Ferraras were required to comply
 
6
with HRS § 501-118 (2006),  they failed to do so, and thus, there
was no legal basis for the Ferraras to record the Commissioner's
 Deed or for the Land Court to issue a new certificate of title.

 
"[A] case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer
 
grant effective relief." City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw.
 
App. 130, 134, 748 P.2d 812, 815 (1988)(citation marks omitted). 

Mootness is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Hamilton ex
 
rel. Letham v. Lethem, 119 Hawai 'i 1, 4, 193 P.3d 839, 842 
(2008). "The proponent of mootness has the heavy burden of
 persuasion." Knuckles v. Weinberger, 511 F.2d 1221, 1222 (9th
 
Cir. 1975) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
 
On January 23, 2015, this court denied the Ferraras'
 
first motion to dismiss filed in this appeal noting that they had
 not asserted that a certificate of title had been issued, and
 even if they had, the Ferraras had not demonstrated no
 encumbrance was noted on the certificate of title related to
 
5 We reject Onaga Inc.'s other contention, that the Certificate of
Title is void because a stay was filed in this appeal. The stay was not
entered until September 19, 2014, whereas the Commissioner's Deed was recorded
and the Certificate of Title was issued on August 29, 2014. 
6   HRS § 501-118 provides: 
HRS § 501-118 Foreclosure. Mortgages of registered land may be
foreclosed like mortgages of unregistered land.
In case of foreclosure by action, a certified copy of the final
judgment of the court confirming the sale may be filed or recorded with
the assistant registrar or the deputy after the time for appealing
therefrom has expired and the purchaser shall thereupon be entitled to
the entry of a new certificate.
In case of foreclosure by exercising the power of sale without a
previous judgment, the affidavit required by chapter 667 shall be
recorded with the assistant registrar. The purchaser or the purchaser's
assigns at the foreclosure sale may thereupon at any time present the
deed under the power of sale to the assistant registrar for recording
and obtain a new certificate. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
to prevent the mortgagor or other person in interest from directly
impeaching by action or otherwise, any foreclosure proceedings affecting
registered land, prior to the entry of a new certificate of title.
After a new certificate of title has been entered, no judgment
recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due thereon shall operate
to open the foreclosure or affect the title to registered land.
 
10
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Onaga Inc.'s mortgage.7 In support of their Second Motion to
 
Dismiss, the Ferraras have provided this court with a certificate
 
of title issued in their names that does not reflect an
 encumbrance related to Onaga Inc.'s mortgage. They thus contend
 this appeal is moot, relying on City Bank, in which this court
 expressed: "[t]he general rule is that the right of a good faith
 purchaser to receive property acquired at a judicial sale cannot
 be affected by the reversal of an order ratifying the sale where
 a supersedeas bond has not been filed." 7 Haw. App. at 133, 748
 P.2d at 814 (citation, quotation marks and brackets omitted).
 
We conclude that the Ferraras have not carried their
 
burden to demonstrate that this appeal is moot. City Bank held
 
that an appeal from a judgment confirming sale was moot because
 the Property had been sold to a good faith third party purchaser
 and the court could not vitiate the closed sale and direct a new
 sale, as requested by the appellants. 7 Haw. App. at 134, 748
 P.2d at 815. Importantly however, City Bank did not involve
 property registered in Land Court. Here, we must consider that a
 certificate of title is given conclusive effect to all matters
 stated in the certificate, except as otherwise provided in HRS
 Chapter 501. HRS § 501-88 (2006).
 
As Onaga Inc. argues in opposing the Ferraras second
 
motion to dismiss, HRS § 501-118 covers foreclosures related to
 property registered in Land Court and expressly provides that:
 "In case of foreclosure by action, a certified copy of the final
 judgment of the court confirming the sale may be filed or
 recorded with the assistant registrar or the deputy after the
 time for appealing therefrom has expired and the purchaser shall
 thereupon be entitled to the entry of a new certificate." 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, based on the provisions of Chapter 501,
 it is questionable whether the certificate of title submitted by
 
7
 HRS § 501-82 provides that "every subsequent purchaser of registered
land who takes a certificate of title for value and in good faith, hold[s] the
same free from all encumbrances except those noted on the certificate in the
order of priority of recordation[.]"
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Ferraras is conclusive in passing title to the Ferraras. 
Rather, it appears that Onaga Inc. is permitted the opportunity
 to appeal the foreclosure by action.
 
There also appear to be further questions regarding the
 
issuance of the certificate of title. Pertinent to this case,
 HRS § 501-106(a) (2006 & Supp. 2015) provides in relevant part: 
§501-106 Entry of a new certificate. (a) No new
certificate of title shall be entered, and no memorandum
shall be made upon any certificate of title by the registrar
or assistant registrar, except:
(1) In pursuance of any deed or other voluntary
instrument; [or]
. . . .
 (4) In cases expressly provided for in this chapter[.]
 
The Ferraras contend they obtained a certificate of title
 
pursuant to subsection (1). However, it is questionable whether
 subsection (1) governs in the case of a judicial foreclosure in
 which case title does not pass by voluntary means. Rather, as
 noted, HRS § 501-118 expressly covers foreclosure of Land Court
 property and, with respect to a "foreclosure by action," a
 certified copy of the final judgment confirming the foreclosure
 sale may be filed after the time for appealing therefrom has
 expired. Under HRS § 501-118, it is only in the case of
 foreclosure by "exercising the power of sale" that the purchaser
 may present the deed of conveyance to obtain a new certificate of
 title. The Ferraras do not contend that they filed a certified
 copy of the Judgment Confirming Sale, instead claiming that title
 was vested in them upon the recording of the Commissioner's Deed. 
This is contrary to the express provisions of HRS § 501-118 where
 there has been a "foreclosure by action," as in this case.
 
In sum, the Ferraras have not carried their burden to
 
establish that Onaga Inc.'s appeal is moot.
B. Onaga Inc.'s Appeal on the Merits
 
Onaga Inc.'s first two points of error concern BNYM's
 
right to conduct a judicial foreclosure sale and the circuit
 
court's confirmation of the sale. In CAAP-13-0002287, we vacated
 the Foreclosure Judgment and remanded for further proceedings. 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bank of New York Mellon, 2014 WL 4661972, at *2. In light of
 
this court's September 18, 2014 SDO in CAAP-13-0002287, we must
 also vacate the Judgment Confirming Sale. See GMAC Mortg., LLC
 
v. Unciano, CAAP-11-0001081, CAAP-13-0000306, CAAP-13-0001307,
 2014 WL 2949441, at *4 (Haw. App. June 30, 2014)(SDO), cert.
 rejected, SCWC-11-0001081, SCWC-13-0000306, SCWC-13-0001307, 2014
 WL 6863963 (Dec. 3, 2014). This resolves Onaga Inc.'s first and
 second point of error.
 
With respect to Onaga Inc.'s third point of error, it
 
contends that the circuit court erred in denying its motion for
 stay of proceedings without bond or conditions pending appeal. 
On appeal, it appears that Onaga Inc. asserts that the circuit
 court should have issued a stay based on the provisions of HRS 
§ 501-118. However, there is nothing in that statute that
 mandates or suggests that a court should issue a stay. Rather,
 the statute is directed to what should occur in Land Court.
 
Moreover, in its motion before the circuit court, Onaga
 
Inc. requested a stay pursuant to HRCP Rule 62(h) and noted that
 it had appealed the Foreclosure Judgment (at the time, this court
 had not issued the September 18, 2014 SDO in CAAP-13-0002287),
 therefore the court should stay the proceedings without requiring
 Onaga Inc. to post a supersedeas bond or placing conditions on
 the stay. Onaga Inc.'s contention is without merit and ignores
 the requirements of HRCP Rule 62.
 
HRCP Rule 62 governs stays of proceedings to enforce a 
judgment. "When interpreting rules promulgated by the court, principles of statutory construction apply." Kawamata Farms, 
Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai
'i 214, 255, 948 P.2d 1055, 
1096 (1997) (quoting State v. Baron, 80 Hawai 'i 107, 113, 905 
P.2d 613, 619 (1995)). 
HRCP Rule 62 provides in pertinent part that:
 
(d) Stay Upon Appeal. When an appeal is taken the appellant
by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay subject to
the exceptions contained in subdivision (a) of this rule.
The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the
notice of appeal or of procuring the order allowing the
appeal, as the case may be. The stay is effective when the

supersedeas bond is approved by the court.
 
. . . .
 (h) Stay of Judgment as to Multiple Claims or Multiple
Parties. When a court has ordered final judgment under the
conditions stated in Rule 54(b), the court may stay
enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a
subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such
conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to
the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.
 
Onaga Inc. requested a stay pending appeal pursuant to
 
HRCP Rule 62(h) without conditions or bond. However, the plain
 
language of HRCP Rule 62(h) only permits a stay of a HRCP Rule
 54(b) judgment until "subsequent judgment[s]" are entered. In
 other words, to permit the circuit court to resolve other claims
 or issues involving other parties. However, a judgment of
 foreclosure is deemed final for appeal purposes notwithstanding
 that issues such as the confirmation of sale remain outstanding. 
HRS § 667-51 (Supp. 2015). In its motion, Onaga Inc. argued that
 because the Foreclosure Judgment was on appeal, a stay should be
 entered; in other words, Onaga Inc. requested a stay upon appeal. 
Thus, HRCP Rule 62(d), not 62(h), is the applicable provision. 
HRCP Rule 62(d) expressly requires the appellant to post a
 supersedeas bond before obtaining a stay. Onaga Inc. does not
 dispute that it did not post a supersedeas bond.
 
The circuit court did not err in denying Onaga Inc.'s
 
motion for a stay of proceedings pending appeal.
III. Conclusion
 
The Ferraras' "Motion to Dismiss the Appeal and
 
[Request] for Judicial Notice" filed August 4, 2015, is granted
 
in part and denied in part. The motion is granted only to the
 extent that we take judicial notice of the offered documents. 
However, for the reasons set forth above, we deny the Ferraras'
 motion to dismiss the appeal as moot.
