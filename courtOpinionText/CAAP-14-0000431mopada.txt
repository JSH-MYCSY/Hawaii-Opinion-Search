I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 7, 2010, the Land Court of the State of 
Hawai'i (land court) recorded an Agreement of Sale between Lisa 
Yongsonyi Nose (Nose) and An of the leasehold interest in unit 
116 of the condominium project known as Century Center (Property) 
for which An paid $320,000. According to An, after she acquired 
the Property, the managing agent for the AOAO, Hawaiiana Management Company (Hawaiiana Management) failed to transmit 
monthly maintenance fee assessment statements to An, "which 
resulted in delinquent payments to the AOAO." 
An alleged that she reached an agreement with the AOAO
 
in June 2012 "to pay down the delinquent assessments over a
 twelve month period and to remain current on the monthly
 maintenance fee assessments." In November 2012, An submitted a
 "Change of Address Form for Billing & Correspondence" to
 Hawaiiana Management. Even after the agreement and the change of
 address form, Hawaiiana Management still did not transmit monthly
 maintenance fee assessment statements on a regular basis to An,
 "which caused [An's] payments to be made late." At some point
 after November 2012, An went in person to Hawaiiana Management to
 have the statements printed, after which An made "the settlement
 payments and the monthly maintenance fee payments in the amounts
 set forth in the monthly statements."
 
According to An, and without her knowledge, the AOAO
 
was charging a 5% "late fee" of the total amount outstanding. An
 additionally alleged, "the AOAO was charging [her] significant
 amounts of attorneys' fees. Neither the late fees nor the
 attorneys' fees were shown on the monthly statements delivered to
 [An]."
 
The fees between July 2012 and May 2013 totaled
 
$15,623.86. An paid off this balance by April 2013. However,
 the AOAO asserted that An was still delinquent in the amount of
 $41,129.62 due to the late charges and legal fees. Based on the
 fees owed, the AOAO noticed a foreclosure sale of the Property.
 An stated she "spoke to [Hawaiiana Management] regarding the
 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
notice of foreclosure sale of the [Property] and was told that as
 
long [she] was making [her] settlement payments and monthly
 payments, the foreclosure sale would not occur." Despite An's
 stated understanding that the foreclosure sale would not occur,
 the foreclosure sale went through and the AOAO purchased the
 Property on May 13, 2013 and the quitclaim deed was recorded on
 May 15, 2013.
 
On June 18, 2013, the AOAO filed a complaint for
 
eviction against Appellants in the district court. Appellants
 filed their answer on August 9, 2013, which included the defense
 that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case
 pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d). Appellants filed with their answer a
 counterclaim against the AOAO including, among other claims,
 wrongful foreclosure and quiet title claims.
 
On August 14, 2013, Appellants filed a "Motion to
 
Dismiss For Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction" based on HRS
 § 604-5(d). The district court held a hearing on the motion to
 dismiss on September 30, 2013. On October 10, 2013, the district
 court entered its Order Denying Motion to Dismiss.
 
On February 4, 2014, the district court entered a
 
Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession in favor of the
 AOAO.
 
On February 12, 2014, Appellants filed their notice of
 
appeal in case no. CAAP-14-0000431. On January 27, 2015, AOAO
 filed their notice of appeal in case no. CAAP-15-0000045. On
 October 1, 2015, by order of this court, appellate case nos.
 CAAP-14-000431 and CAAP-15-0000045 were consolidated under no.
 CAAP-14-0000431.
 
II. 
STANDARD OF REVIEW

 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
"The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a 
question of law that is reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard." U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. Castro
, 131 Hawai 'i 28, 34, 
313 P.3d 717, 723 (2013) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted) (citing Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 
98, 110 P.3d 1042, 1045 (2005)).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
District Court Jurisdiction 
 
Appellants contend the district court lacked
 
jurisdiction over the eviction action under HRS § 604-5(d), which
 
provides:
 
§604-5 Civil jurisdiction.
 
. . . .
 
(d) The district courts shall not have cognizance of
real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate
comes in question, nor actions for libel, slander,
defamation of character, malicious prosecution, false
imprisonment, breach of promise of marriage, or seduction;
nor shall they have power to appoint referees in any cause.
 
Where a defendant asserts HRS § 604-5(d) as a defense 
to jurisdiction of the district court, the defendant must raise 
the defense in a written answer or motion, and must attach an affidavit. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai
'i 
32, 36, 265 P.3d 1128, 1132 (2011). The plain language of District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1, 
requires that the affidavit set forth "the source, nature and 
extent of the title claimed by defendant to the land in question, and such further particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature of defendant's claim." Appellants argue that because they satisfied the requirements of DCRCP Rule 12.1, the district court should have dismissed the action. 
Appellants rely on Peelua for their contention that the 
district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In Peelua, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court explained, 
Pursuant to DCRCP Rule 12.1, where a defendant seeks to
assert, as a defense to the jurisdiction of a district
court, that the action is one in which title to real estate
will come into question, the defendant must raise such a
defense in a written answer or written motion, and must
attach an affidavit thereto.
 
Id. at 36, 265 P.3d at 1132. "Under the plain language of Rule
 
12.1, an affidavit that raises a defense to the court's
 jurisdiction must set forth 'the source, nature, and extent of
 the title claimed by defendant' and 'further particulars'
 sufficient to 'fully apprise the court of the nature of
 defendant's claim.'" Id. The supreme court clarified that
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6"further particulars" in this context "suggests that the
affidavit must include some details or specificity regarding the
nature of defendant's claim."  Id. at 37, 265 P.3d at 1133.  The
supreme court noted that a declaration that merely asserts that
title is at issue fails to provide "the source, nature, and
extent of the [the] claim."  Id.  at 37-38, 265 P.3d at 1133-34
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
In support of his jurisdictional defense, the defendant
in Peelua  attached an affidavit to the motion to dismiss, which
provided:
5.  I am the owner of the Property identified in the
Complaint filed in this matter.  Because of time
constraints, I cannot file a copy of my Deed to the property
with this affidavit, but I will furnish a copy of the Deed
as soon as I can.
6.  The Property identified in the Complaint consists of
lands which have been owned by Respondent's family for
generations, going back to the time of the Great Mahele. 
. . . .
8.
  The Property has passed down through my family over
time, and it was eventually deeded to me by my family.
[. . . .]
10. . . . I was defrauded, duped, coerced and tricked into
engaging in transaction [sic] which involve the Property in
the Complaint.
Peeula, 126 Hawai#  at 35, 265 P.3d at 1131 (brackets omitted). 
The supreme court observed that the defendant "assert[ed] in his
affidavit that he has a deed to the property.  However,
[defendant's] affidavit does not describe the contents of the
deed or the type of deed he acquired."  Id. at 38, 265 P.3d at
1134.  The supreme court noted that "to fully apprise the court,
a defendant would need to provide some details regarding the
basis for the title."  Id.
More recently, the supreme court in Castro, held that a
defendant did not sufficiently apprise the court of the source,
nature, and extent of her claim to title where her assertion
"that she is 'informed and believes' that 'U.S. Bank may not own
her note and mortgage and may not be able to foreclose due to
defects in transfer of the loan documents,'" was too speculative
to satisfy DCRCP Rule 12.1.  Id. at 38, 313 P.3d at 727 (emphasisNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted). The supreme court also held that the defendant's
 
declaration that "'it is believed' that a 'securitization expert
 report will establish a break in the chain of title of the loan
 documents' . . . does not establish how or whether the manner in
 which the Note and Mortgage were assigned to U.S. Bank affects
 [defendant's] claim of title to the Property.'" 
Id. (emphasis
 
and ellipsis omitted). Finally, the supreme court noted,
 "[defendant's] claim that the foreclosure was wrongful because
 she was denied a loan modification is also stated in a vague and
 conclusory manner. Her declaration does not establish how the
 lack of a loan modification would affect her claim of title." 
Id. at 39, 313 P.3d at 728. 
In an unreported case, 
Fed. Nat. Mortg. Ass'n v. Brown,
 
No. CAAP-11-0000572 (App. May 19, 2014) (SDO), this court held
 that a defendant had provided enough detail in his declaration,
3
 
3 The defendant's declaration stated: 
12. After closing the loan, due to a disability, it became
very difficult for me to make my monthly payments. Thus, in
July of 2009, Plaintiff Fannie Mae and IndyMac invited me to
participate in [Home Affordable Modification Program
(HAMP)].
 
13. On June 19, 2009, I accepted Fannie Mae and IndyMac's
offer to participate in HAMP, and entered into a [Trial
Period Plan (TPP)], and provided them with all of the
required documentation. I was promised therein that as long
as I complied with the TPP, my property would not be
foreclosed upon and my mortgage would be permanently
modified upon making the three monthly payments of $2,543.80
required under the TPP.
 
14. Therefore, I submitted my first and second payments
under the TPP in the amount of $2,543.80, which were
accepted. I submitted my third payment in August 2009, in
the amount of $2,543.80.
 
15. Despite my timely submission of that payment and despite
my full compliance with the terms of the TPP, One West [sic]
Bank returned my check to me along with a letter dated
August 27, 2009, strangely explaining that "the amount
received does not represent the total amount due at this
time."
 
. . . .
 17. [On September 16, 2009] OneWest Bank recorded a Notice
of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale in
the Bureau of Conveyances, initiating a nonjudicial
foreclosure upon [the Property] in breach of the TPP.
 
. . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(...continued)3
20. Because I accepted the terms of its and Fannie Mae's
offer to modify my loan through a TPP under the federal HAMP
program, because I complied with all of the requirements of
that TPP, and because Fannie Mae and OneWest Bank breached
the terms of that plan, OneWest Bank was estopped from
proceeding with foreclosure upon my home.
Brown, SDO at 4 (ellipses and some brackets omitted).
8attached deed, and mortgage from which we could deduce the
source, nature, and extent of the title claimed.  Id. at 1.  This
court explained, "The Mortgage reflects that [defendant] held
title as Tenant in Severalty, and the Quitclaim Apartment Deed
reflects that [defendant] then conveyed his interest in the
Property to himself and his wife as Tenants by the Entirety." 
Id. at 5.  The defendant's declaration in Brown
also sets forth with particularity . . . the basis for his
claim challenging Fannie Mae's assertion of title to the
Property such as to apprise the district court how his
allegation bears on the question of title.  His declaration
raised the specific contention that the non-judicial
foreclosure was improper because he and IndyMac had entered
into the TPP under which IndyMac allegedly agreed not to
pursue foreclosure.
Id. at 8 (internal citation omitted). 
In Appellants' answer to the AOAO's complaint,
Appellants asserted, "Pursuant to [HRS] § 604-5(d), the district
court lacks jurisdiction over this case because the action is a
real action or one in which the title to real estate is involved. 
Pursuant to the [DCRCP] Rule 12.1, the Affidavit of [An] is
attached."  An's affidavit stated:
2. I acquired title to the [Property] from Lisa
Yongsonyi Nose by virtue of an Agreement of Sale dated
December 7, 2010 and recorded as Land Court Document No.
4028097.  The purchase price for the Real Property was
$320,000.
3.I am the sole owner of the equitable interests
in the [Property].
4. My interest in the [Property] was wrongfully
foreclosed upon by the [AOAO], as set forth in detail in the
Counterclaim filed concurrently herewith.
5.From and after my acquisition of the [Property,
Hawaiiana Management], the managing agent of the [Property]
for [the AOAO], failed and/or refused to transmit all of the
monthly statements to me, which resulted in delinquent
payments to the AOAO.
6.In or about June of 2012, I reached an agreement  
An did not attach the Agreement of Sale to her
 
affidavit nor does An attach an assignment of lease for the
 
Property. However, attached to the AOAO's complaint was the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with the AOAO to pay down the delinquent assessments over a
twelve month period and to remain current on the monthly
maintenance fee assessments.
 
7. Even after this agreement, [the AOAO's] agent,
Hawaiiana [Management], did not send me monthly statements
on a regular basis, which caused payments to be made late.
 
8. In November 2012, I executed a Hawaiiana Change
of Address Form for Billing & Correspondence ("Change of
Address Form").
 
9. Even after submitting the Change of Address
form, Hawaiiana [Management] did not send me the monthly
maintenance fee assessment statements. I had to go to
Hawaiiana [Management] and have
them printed for me. Thereafter, I continued to make the
settlement payments and the monthly maintenance fee payments
in the amounts set forth in the monthly statements.
 
10. Unbeknownst to me and without notice, the AOAO was
charging me a late fee each month in the amount of 5% of the total
amount claimed to be outstanding. Also unbeknownst to me, the
AOAO was charging me significant amounts of attorneys' fees.
Neither the late fees nor the attorneys' fees were shown on the
monthly statements delivered to me.
 
11. Without my knowledge, the AOAO applied
approximately $15,623.86 of my Settlement Payments and/or
Monthly Assessment Payments to late charges which
purportedly accrued from July 2012 to May 2013.
 
12. As of April 2013, I made all of the Settlement
Payments and all or a sufficient number of Monthly
Assessment Payments to keep current, but for the AOAO's
secret assessment of illegal and unenforceable late charges,
as well as, legal fees and costs related thereto.
 
13. In spite of all the payments I made, the AOAO
noticed a foreclosure sale of the [Property] and alleged
that I was delinquent in the amount of $41,129.62 as of
April.
 
14. I spoke to Hawaiiana [Management] regarding the
notice of foreclosure sale of the [Property] and was told
that as long as I was making my settlement payments and
monthly payments, the foreclosure sale would not occur.
 
15. Because I was current on the monthly settlement
payments and monthly maintenance fee payments set forth in
the statements sent to me, I understood that the foreclosure
sale would not occur.
 
16. Unbeknownst to me, the sale went forward and the
AOAO claimed to be the highest bidder for the [Property] in
the amount of $1.
 
17. By counterclaim attached hereto, I am
challenging the AOAO's wrongful foreclosure and the AOAO's
claim of title to the [Property].
 
18. I dispute that [the AOAO's] alleged title to the
[Property] is superior to my title to the [Property].

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
AOAO's Quitclaim Assignment of Lease, which documented the
 
transfer of interest in the Property.4 Exhibit A to the
 
Quitclaim Assignment of Lease shows that on April 2, 2009, the
 land court recorded the interest in the Property as assigned to
 Nose as Tenant in Severalty. It also shows that on December 7,
 2010, the land court recorded the Agreement of Sale of the
 Property from Nose to An. Additionally, An does set forth with
 particularity the basis for her claim challenging the AOAO's
 assertion of title to the Property, that the AOAO wrongfully
 foreclosed on the Property because An had completed the payments
 due to the AOAO under the Settlement Agreement. Unlike Peelua
 and Castro, An's affidavit provides bases for this court to
 determine the nature of the claim that are not speculative and
 are not conclusory. The Quitclaim Assignment of Lease attached
 to the AOAO's complaint along with An's affidavit provided
 sufficient information to apprise this court of the source,
 nature, and extent of the title An claims to the Property. See
 
DCRCP Rule 12.1.
 
Because An sufficiently set forth the source, nature,
 
and extent of the title claimed and such further particulars
 apprising this court of the nature of her claim under DCRCP Rule
 12.1, the district court erred in its Order Denying Motion to
 Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under HRS § 604­5(d).
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we vacate the following entered in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit: 
(1) the February 4, 2014 "Writ of Possession";
 (2) the February 4, 2014 "Judgment for Possession";
 (3) the January 28, 2014 denial of Defendants Young Ja 
4 "Once a defendant establishes that title is in question, a court
cannot consider evidence or arguments in rebuttal of the defendant's claim to
title, or evidence in support of the plaintiff's claim to a superior basis oftitle because that would be for the circuit court to decide." Peelua, 126 
Hawai'i at 39, 265 P.3d at 1135. However, where a plaintiff attaches a
quitclaim deed to its complaint, a court may consider it in determining adefendant's assertion that the district court lacks jurisdiction under HRS§ 604-5(d). Id. at 39, 265 P.3d at 1135 ("[The plaintiff] was required to
plead entitlement to possession of the Property and could appropriately attacha copy of its quitclaim deed in support of its claimed ownership.").
