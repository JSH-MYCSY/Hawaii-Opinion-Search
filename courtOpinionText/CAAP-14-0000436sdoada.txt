SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Leonard, JJ.)

 
After conducting a non-judicial foreclosure of its lien
 
for outstanding maintenance fees, the Association of Apartment
 
Owners of Century Center, Inc. (AOAO) acquired its interest in
 the subject apartment unit (Unit 3201) by quitclaim assignment of
 lease. The AOAO thereafter filed a summary possession complaint
 in the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court)
 seeking to evict the occupants of Unit 3201. The appeal in No.
 CAAP-14-0000436 relates to the Judgment for Possession, and the
 accompanying Writ of Possession, for Unit 3201 obtained by the
 AOAO on February 13, 2014, against CK Enterprises LLC (CK
 Enterprises), Thai Hawaiian Massage, Inc. (Thai Hawaiian
 Massage), and Pojjanee Varney (Pojjanee). The appeal in No.
 CAAP-14-0001238 relates to the Judgment for Possession, and the
 accompanying Writ of Possession, for Unit 3201 obtained by the
 AOAO on September 30, 2014, against Charles Varney (Charles).

In both appeals, the Appellants  argue that the
District Court lacked jurisdiction over the AOAO's summary

 
possession action because Appellants had sufficiently raised a
 claim to title to divest the District Court of jurisdiction. 
See

 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d) (1993) ("The district
 courts shall not have cognizance of real actions, nor actions in
 which the title to real estate comes in question . . . ."). In
 particular, Appellants argue that their claim to title is
 superior to that of the AOAO because the AOAO lacked the
 authority to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure, and therefore,
 the non-judicial foreclosure by which the AOAO acquired its
 interest in Unit 3201 was void. We recently considered
 essentially the same claim to title presented by Appellants in
 Association of Apartment Owners of Century Center, Inc. v.
 
1The two appeals were consolidated by order of this court.
 
2The appellants in No. CAAP-14-0000436 are CK Enterprises, Thai Hawaiian
Massage, and Pojjanee. The appellants in No. CAAP-14-0001238 are CK
Enterprises, Thai Hawaiian Massage, Pojjanee, and Charles. We will
 collectively refer to the appellants in both appeals as "Appellants."

Nomura, CAAP-15-0000119, 2016 WL 2940855 (Hawai 'i App. May 11, 
2016) (Memorandum Opinion). Consistent with Nomura, we conclude 
that Appellants' claim to title was sufficient to divest the District Court of Jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the Judgments for Possession entered by the District Court and remand the case to the District Court with instruction to dismiss the summary possession action for lack of jurisdiction. 
I.
 
On March 19, 2009, Young Hui Kim (Kim) purchased the 
leasehold interest in Unit 3201, an apartment unit of the
 condominium project known as Century Center, from Henry Lee
 Jensen (Jensen). In connection with the purchase, Kim obtained a
 loan from Jensen and executed a Purchase Money Real Property
 Mortgage in favor of Jensen. As the owner of Unit 3201, Kim was
 
responsible for paying maintenance fees to the AOAO.
 
According to Kim, after she purchased Unit 3201, she
 
did not receive any invoices for maintenance fees from the AOAO
 
or its management company and assumed her tenant was paying the
 fees. In late 2011, she was informed there were outstanding
 maintenance fees, made efforts to cure the default, discussed and
 took steps to enter into a "workout" plan with the AOAO's
 Treasurer, and was informed that the AOAO Board had approved the
 workout plan. However, Kim subsequently received a letter from
 the AOAO's attorney which stated that the AOAO had rejected her
 workout plan and demanded full payment on terms less favorable
 than her workout plan of the outstanding balance. Further
 efforts to resolve the maintenance fee dispute were unsuccessful.
 
On October 10, 2012, Kim assigned her interest in Unit 
3201 to CK Enterprises, an entity in which Kim asserts she is the sole member, manager, and beneficiary, through an Assignment of Lease and Sublease recorded in the Land Court of the State of Hawai
'i (Land Court) on October 11, 2012. 
The AOAO pursued a non-judicial foreclosure of its lien
 
for the maintenance fees assessed against Unit 3201. The AOAO
 submitted a "Notice of Default and Intention to Foreclose," which
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was recorded in the Land Court on September 27, 2012. The AOAO
 
held a public auction on July 18, 2013, and purchased Unit 3201
 for one dollar, no other bidders being present. On August 15,
 2013, the AOAO recorded a "Quitclaim Assignment of Lease" in the
 Land Coirt, transferring Unit 3201 to itself.
 
On December 13, 2013, the AOAO filed a summary
 
possession complaint seeking to evict the occupants of Unit 3201
 and naming as defendants Thai Hawaiian Massage, Pojjanee, and Doe
 individuals and entities. Kim and CK Enterprises moved to
 
intervene and together with Thai Hawaiian Massage and Pojjanee
 
(collectively, "Movants") moved to dismiss the AOAO's complaint
 "for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because this case is an
 action in which the title to real property is in dispute over
 which this district court does not have cognizance." Movants
 asserted that the applicable statutes only permitted the AOAO to
 conduct a non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale if it was
 authorized by the AOAO's governing documents; that the AOAO's
 governing documents did not authorize a non-judicial foreclosure
 by power of sale; and therefore, the non-judicial foreclosure by
 power of sale through which the AOAO had obtained its interest in
 Unit 3201 was void. Movants further asserted that CK Enterprises
 and Kim, who had acquired their interest in Unit 3201 through
 purchase from the prior owner Jensen, had a superior claim to
 title than the AOAO. In support of their motion, Movants
 submitted Kim's declaration, in which she identified and
 authenticated documents (attached as exhibits) verifying her
 purchase of Unit 3201 from Jensen and transfer to CK Enterprises;
 described her attempts to enter into a workout plan and referred
 to a letter from her counsel to the AOAO (attached as an exhibit)
 asserting that the AOAO was not authorized by its governing
 documents or applicable law to conduct a non-judicial
 foreclosure; and stated that she and CK Enterprises claimed
 "superior title" to Unit 3201. 
In their reply to the AOAO's opposition to the motion
 
to dismiss, Movants attached a copy of a Land Court Petition
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filed by CK Enterprises and Kim to remove the references to the
 
AOAO's interest in Unit 3201 obtained through the non-judicial
 foreclosure and quitclaim assignment of lease from the chain of
 title. The Petition alleged that the AOAO's non-judicial
 foreclosure was void, that the AOAO engaged in fraud and unfair
 and deceptive practices regarding the workout plan which
 invalidated the non-judicial foreclosure, and that petitioners
 were entitled to exercise their right of redemption. Attached to
 the Petition was a declaration signed by Kim under penalty of law
 that the factual allegations set forth in the Petition were true
 and correct to the best of her knowledge, information, and
 belief.
 
The District Court granted CK Enterprises' motion to
 
intervene but denied Kim's motion to intervene. The District
 Court denied Movants' motion to dismiss and filed its order
 denying the motion to dismiss on January 31, 2014. Movants filed
 a motion for reconsideration of the denial of their motion to
 dismiss, which the District Court denied on February 4, 2014. 
Thereafter, on February 13, 2014, a Judgment for Possession and
 Writ of Possession were filed in favor of the AOAO and against CK
 Enterprises, Thai Hawaiian Massage, and Pojjanee. 
On February 14, 2014, CK Enterprises, Thai Hawaiian
 
Massage, and Pojjanee filed their notice of appeal in No. CAAP­14-000436, appealing from the February 13, 2014, Judgment for
 Possession.
 
On February 24, 2014, the AOAO submitted an ex parte
 
motion to certify Charles as John Doe 1 in its summary possession
 complaint. The District Court granted the AOAO's motion. On May
 
27, 2014, the AOAO filed a motion for summary judgment as to its
 
claims against Charles. CK Enterprises, Thai Hawaiian Massage,
 Pojjanee, and Charles filed an opposition to the summary judgment
 motion and asked that the case be dismissed for lack of
 jurisdiction. Following a hearing, the District Court denied the
 AOAO's motion for summary judgment, concluding that questions
 over title and jurisdiction precluded the grant of summary 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment. The District Court filed its order denying the AOAO's
 
motion for summary judgment as to Charles on July 24, 2014.
 
CK Enterprises, Thai Hawaiian Massage, Pojjanee, and
 
Charles filed a renewed motion to dismiss the case for lack of
 jurisdiction, which the District Court denied by order filed on
 August 13, 2014.
 
The AOAO filed a motion for reconsideration of the
 
order denying its motion for summary judgment as to Charles. The
 District Court granted the AOAO's motion for reconsideration and
 granted summary judgment in favor of the AOAO and against
 Charles. On September 30, 2014, the District Court entered a
 Judgment for Possession and a Writ of Possession in favor of the
 AOAO and against Charles. On October 13, 2014, Appellants filed
 their notice of appeal in No. CAAP-14-0001238, appealing from the
 September 30, 2014, Judgment for Possession.
 
II.

In No. CAAP-14-0000436,  Appellants contend that: (1)
pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d), the District Court lacked

 
jurisdiction over the AOAO's summary possession complaint; and
 
(2)
 the District Court erred in denying Kim's motion for

intervention. In No. CAAP-14-0001238,  Appellants contend that:
(1)
 pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d), the District Court lacked
 
jurisdiction over the AOAO's summary possession complaint; (2)
 HRS § 667-102(b) (Supp. 2015) does not bar Kim and CK Enterprises
 from disputing title to Unit 3201 in the instant case; and (3)
 the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the September 30,
 2014, Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession because the
 appeal in No. CAAP-14-0000436 was pending.
 
We conclude that pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d), the
 
District Court lacked jurisdiction over the AOAO's summary

motion to dismiss, and the Honorable James S. Kawashima issued the February

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
possession complaint because CK Enterprises raised a defense to
 
the AOAO's summary possession complaint which placed title to
 Unit 3201 in question. In Nomura, No. CAAP–15–0000119, 2016 WL
 2940855, this court recently addressed essentially the same claim
 to title raised by Appellants, which was asserted by the Nomura
 defendants as a defense to a summary possession action brought by
 the AOAO. 
As in this case, the AOAO in Nomura had acquired its
 
interest in the subject unit through a non-judicial foreclosure
 of a lien for payments owed to the AOAO, and the AOAO thereafter
 filed a summary possession complaint in District Court. The
 Nomura defendants filed a motion to dismiss, supported by their
 joint declaration, asserting that they had purchased the unit and
 obtained title through a quitclaim deed, which they attached as
 an exhibit; that the non-judicial foreclosure under power of sale
 by which the AOAO had acquired its interest was invalid because
 the AOAO's governing documents did not authorize it to conduct a
 non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale; and therefore, the
 District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the
 case was "an action in which the title to real property is in
 dispute." Nomura, 2016 WL 2940855, at *2-4. We held in Nomura
 
that the Nomura defendants "have sufficiently set forth the
 scope, nature, and extent of their claim to title to the land in
 question[,]" and "[t]herefore, the district court was without
 jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5(d) because title to the land in
 question was at issue." Id. at *5. 
Similarly, in this case, we conclude that CK 
Enterprises sufficiently set forth the scope, nature, and extent of its claim to title to Unit 3201, and therefore, the District Court lacked jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5(d) because title to Unit 3201 was in question. See HRS § 604-5(d); District Court 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12.1; Nomura, 2016 WL 2940855, at *5; Fukumoto v. Onogi, No. 28561, 2009 WL 475788 (Hawai
'i App. 
Feb. 26, 2009). Because we conclude that the District Court 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
lacked jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5(d), we need not address the
 
other issues raised by Appellants in their appeals. 
III.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Judgments for
 
Possession entered on February 13, 2014, and September 30, 2014,
 by the District Court, and we remand the case to the District
 Court with instructions to dismiss the AOAO's summary possession
 action for lack of jurisdiction.
