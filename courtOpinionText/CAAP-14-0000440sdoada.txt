NO. CAAP-14-0000440
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DAVID SHINN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DCW-13-0005538)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant David Shinn (Shinn) appeals from
 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, entered on January
 
1
27, 2014 by the District Court of the First Circuit  (district
 
court
).
 
On appeal, Shinn contends the district court erred in

 
convicting him, because there was insufficient evidence that he
 
committed harassment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711­
1106(a) (2014 Repl.).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Shinn's
 appeal is without merit.
 
(1) Shinn argues that there was insufficient evidence 
to convict him of harassment because Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) did not establish that he had the intent to touch 
in an offensive manner and that he acted with the specific intent

to "harass, annoy, or alarm" Honolulu Police Department Officer
 
Eric Hokama (Officer Hokama) as required under HRS § 711-1106(1).
 
"[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be
 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when the
 appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence
 to support a conviction[.]" 
State v. Matavale , 115 Hawai 'i 149, 
157, 166 P.3d 322, 330 (2007). "'Substantial evidence' as to
 every material element of the offense charged is credible
 evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
 enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." 
Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236,
 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). 
It is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess the
credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of
fact; the judge may accept or reject any witness's testimony
in whole or in part. Lono v. State, 63 Haw. 470, 473, 629
 
P.2d 630, 633 (1981). As the trier of fact, the judge may
draw all reasonable and legitimate inferences and deductions
from the evidence, and the findings of the trial court will
not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. Id. at 473–74,
 
629 P.2d at 633. An appellate court will not pass upon the
trial judge's decisions with respect to the credibility of
witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because this is
the province of the trial judge.
 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996). 
According to Officer Hokama, who was responding to a
 
call by Shinn for assistance at Straub Clinic & Hospital, Shinn
 
started pushing him after a conversation they had regarding the
 level of care Shinn's hospitalized mother was receiving. Shinn
 stepped between Officer Hokama and the doctor and started pushing
 Officer Hokama and poking him in the chest. Officer Hokama
 testified that he did not give Shinn permission to touch him, and
 that he responded by telling Shinn to step back. After Shinn
 poked or pushed him again, Officer Hokama said, "You know what? 
You gotta stop." Officer Hokama testified that Shinn started
 yelling and when Officer Hokama escorted Shinn back to his
 mother's room so that he could talk to the doctor, Shinn grabbed
 the right sleeve of Officer Hokama's uniform. Officer Hokama
 told Shinn, "Stop, you're under arrest for harassment already,"
 and proceeded to handcuff Shinn.
 
The nurse taking care of Shinn's mother (Nurse)
 
testified that she witnessed Shinn touch Officer Hokama after he
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"started to yell . . . ." The Nurse described Shinn as "upset",
 
"yelling", and "raising his arms up in the air." While the Nurse
 testified that she witnessed Shinn touching Officer Hokama only
 once prior to the arrest, she also stated that she was looking
 after Shinn's mother. Accordingly, one could reasonably infer
 that the Nurse did not witness the interaction outside of the
 room between Officer Hokama and Shinn. However, the Nurse
 testified that she witnessed Shinn touch Officer Hokama in the
 room, and that Officer Hokama warned Shinn that it was the second
 time Shinn had touched him.
 
The testimony of Officer Hokama and the Nurse
 
constituted substantial evidence that Shinn touched Officer
 Hokama "in an offensive manner" under HRS § 711-1106(1)(a). See
 
State v. Sanchez, 9 Haw. App. 315, 323, 837 P.2d 1313, 1318
 (1992) (holding that substantial evidence supported the trial
 court's finding that the defendant touched police officer and
 subjected the police officer to offensive physical contact, when
 officers testified that the defendant pushed the police officer).
 
(2) Shinn argues that the State failed to establish
 
that Shinn acted with the specific intent to "harass, annoy, or
 alarm" Officer Hokama as required under HRS § 711-1106(1)(a). 
Shinn disagrees with the district court's statement at trial that
 intent could be inferred from Shinn's actions in persisting to
 interrupt the officer and asserts that Shinn's intent was his
 concern for his mother.
 
"[I]t is an elementary principle of law that intent may
 
be proved by circumstantial evidence; that the element of intent
 can rarely be shown by direct evidence; and it may be shown by a
 reasonable inference arising from the circumstances surrounding
 the act." State v. Hopkins, 60 Haw. 540, 544, 592 P.2d 810,
 
812 13 (1979) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)
 (quoting State v. Yabusaki, 58 Haw. 404, 409, 570 P.2d 844, 847
 (1977)).
 
While Officer Hokama, the Nurse, and Shinn testified
 
that Shinn was initially concerned for his mother, the testimony
 also demonstrated that Shinn's intent shifted after Officer
 Hokama's arrival. Officer Hokama testified that Shinn followed

him into the hallway and started yelling at him when Officer
 
Hokama was speaking with the doctor. Shinn stepped between
 Officer Hokama and the doctor and started poking Officer Hokama
 in the chest and pushing him. Officer Hokama asked Shinn to stop
 and step back, and warned him that he could be arrested for
 harassment. Officer Hokama testified that Shinn "kept
 interrupting" his duties. Similarly, the Nurse testified that
 Officer Hokama told Shinn to stop touching him, but Shinn
 continued to do so. Shinn himself testified that Officer Hokama
 told him not to touch him.
 
Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, it can
 
be reasonably inferred from the circumstances surrounding the
 incident that Shinn intended to "harass, annoy, or alarm" Officer
 Hokama.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 27, 2014 Notice
 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, entered in the District Court
 of the First Circuit is affirmed.
