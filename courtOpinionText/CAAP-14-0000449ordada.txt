and
 
COLLETTE N. DRYDEN, TRUSTEE OF THE FREDERICK W. DRYDEN TRUST,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-0700(2))

 
ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J.)

 
Upon consideration of the April 29, 2014 filing by
 
Connie C. Chow, counsel for Plaintiff/Counter-Claim
 
Defendant/Appellee Old Republic National Title Insurance Company
 (Appellant), and the records and files herein, it appears as
 follows.
 
(1) Counsel Connie C. Chow filed an April 29, 2014
 
letter addressed addressed to the "Chief Clerk of the Supreme
 Court," but designated said letter as a "motion" in the Judiciary
 Electronic Filing System (JEFS) and said letter, although
 addressed to the Chief Clerk, seeks relief from this court of
 dismissal of the instant appeal. As such, this court will review
 the April 29, 2014 letter as a motion to dismiss the appeal
 (Motion).
 (2) As a motion seeking relief from this court, the 
Motion fails to comply with Rules 27 and 32 of the Hawai 'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure; thus, this court declines to address the 
Motion on the merits at this time; and counsel Connie C. Chow is cautioned that future failure to comply with the rules may result in an order to show cause and/or sanctions. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is dismissed 
without consideration on the merits. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 3, 2014. 
Chief Judge
