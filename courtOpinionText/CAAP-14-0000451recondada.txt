IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
IN THE MATTER OF THE SAMUEL R. HURWITZ
 
REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST DATED DECEMBER 19, 2011
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(TRUST NO. 12-1-0132)

 
ORDER DENYING AS UNTIMELY THE
 
OCTOBER 14, 2014 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion for Reconsideration of
 
Dismissal of Appeal, filed on October 14, 2014, by Defendant-
Appellant Nina Savino (Appellant), through counsel Joseph W.
 
Huster, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that
 
(1) Appellant seeks reconsideration of the October 3, 2014 order dismissing the appeal pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30; (2) HRAP Rule 40(a) provides that "[a] 
motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 
days after the filing of the . . . dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional time is granted during such NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
period by a judge . . . of the appellate court"; (3) Appellant
 
filed the instant motion for reconsideration beyond ten (10) days
 after the October 3, 2014 order, without leave to file a late
 motion; and (4) there is no contention that Appellant's counsel
 Huster failed to receive the dismissal order due to alleged
 computer problems.  Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for
 
Reconsideration of Dismissal of Appeal is denied as untimely.
