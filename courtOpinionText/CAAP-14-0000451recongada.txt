IN THE MATTER OF THE SAMUEL R. HURWITZ
 
REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST DATED DECEMBER 19, 2011
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(TRUST NO. 12-1-0132)
 
ORDER GRANTING THE MAY 12, 2014
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DISMISSAL
 
OF APPEAL FOR NON-PAYMENT OF FILING FEES
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion for Reconsideration of
 
Dismissal of Appeal for Non-Payment of Filing Fees, filed May 12,
 
2014, by Petitioner-Appellant Nina Savino (Appellant), through
 counsel Joseph W. Huster (Counsel), the papers in support, and
 the record, it appears that:
 
(1)
 Appellant seeks reconsideration of the court's 
April 30, 2014 order dismissing the appeal, pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 11(b)(2) and (c)(2), for   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
failure to pay appellate filing and docketing fees within sixty 
days after the notice of appeal was filed; 
(2) Appellant, proceeding pro se, conventionally filed
 
the notice of appeal in the First Circuit Court (circuit court)
 on February 5, 2014;
1
 
(3) The next day, the circuit court clerk
 
conventionally filed a notice for payment of fees,2
 notifying
Appellant to pay the appellate filing and docketing fees to the
 circuit court by February 18, 2014, or the appeal may be
 dismissed, and the fees are "payable in the form of a money order
 or cashier's check - no personal checks";
 
(4)
 Counsel represents that Appellant, a New York
 
resident, "attempted to mail the filing fee to the Court, but her
 payment was returned to her because it was not in the form of a
 check from a business account";
 
(5) Neither the appellate record nor the electronic 
record in the Hawai
'i State Judiciary's Ho 'ohiki website for the 
underlying case, No. 1TR12-1-000132, reflect that the appellate court or circuit court clerks returned Appellant's fee payment; 
(6) Nonetheless, the Court Administrator for the First
 
Circuit Court, Legal Documents Branch 1, informally reported to
 this court that the circuit court clerk returned Appellant's
 personal check by certified mail, which Appellant received on
 February 14, 2014;
 
1
 The circuit court clerk electronically filed the notice of appeal on
February 21, 2014.
 
2
 The circuit court clerk electronically filed the notice for payment
of fees on February 21, 2014.

(7) Appellant retained Counsel on April 28, 2014, and
 
Counsel paid the filing and docketing fees at the Supreme Court
 
Clerk's Office on April 30, 2014, a few hours after the court
 entered the dismissal order; and
 
(8) Considering Appellant's prior—albeit unsuccessful—
 
attempt to pay timely the filing and docketing fees when she was
 proceeding pro se, and there being no apparent prejudice to
 Respondents-Appellees First Hawaiian Bank and the Hurwitz Family
 Beneficiaries, reconsideration of the April 30, 2014 dismissal
 order is warranted. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for
 
Reconsideration of Dismissal of Appeal for Non-Payment of Filing
 Fees is granted. The circuit court clerk shall file the record
 on appeal within sixty days from the date of this order, unless
 otherwise extended by the court.
