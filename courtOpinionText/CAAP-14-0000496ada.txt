1998 (Yoneji Family Trust) (collectively, Yonejis) appeal from
 
1
the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's  (circuit court): 
(1) "Amended Judgment (Amends the Judgment Filed May 1,
 
2013)," filed January 27, 2014;
 
(2) "Judgment," filed May 1, 2013; and
 
(3) "Order Granting Defendant Charlene Yoneji's Motion
 
for Summary Judgment (Filed 2/22/13)," (Order) filed May 1, 2013.
 
On appeal, the Yonejis contend that (1) the circuit
 
court erred in granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of
 Defendant-Appellee Charlene Yoneji (Charlene) and (2) the circuit
 
court abused its discretion in awarding Charlene attorneys' fees
 
and costs.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case involves a family trust, the Mitsuo Trust,
 
that is funded by rental income generated from two income-
producing properties (together, Properties) that were originally
 
owned by grantor, Mitsuo Yoneji (Mitsuo). The Mitsuo Trust left
 
interests in the Properties to Mitsuo's two sons, Neil and Owen
 
Yoneji (Owen), and any children Mitsuo's sons may have had. Owen
 
was married to Charlene and had one child, Mary Yoneji (Mary).
 
Four family trusts owned the Properties in varying
 
percentages: the Mitsuo Trust, the Revocable Trust of Owen Kazuo
 
Yoneji, dated January 11, 1994 (Owen Trust), the Revocable Trust
 
of Charlene Tsuruko Yoneji, dated January 11, 1994 (Charlene
 
Trust), and the Yoneji Family Trust. According to Neil, all
 
profits and expenses related to the Properties were handled
 
through a single trust bank account at the First Hawaiian Bank
 (Mitsuo Trust Account), which operated under the Mitsuo Trust.
 
Neil and Owen served as Successor Individual Co-Trustees of the
 
Mitsuo Trust. Mary was not properly appointed Successor
 Individual Co-Trustee of the Mitsuo Trust.
 
Mary declared that on or about April 11, 2008, per
 
Owen's instructions, she issued a bank check payable to Charlene
 in the amount of $67,031.14 from the Mitsuo Trust Account without
 the authorization of Neil. Charlene endorsed the check to Owen

 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and returned it to Mary, who then deposited the check into a 
Kaua'i Government Federal Credit Union account to which Neil 
alleges he did not have access. 
On October 26, 2009, the Yonejis filed this lawsuit,
 
alleging that Mary and Charlene improperly depleted the Mitsuo
 Trust Account, and wrongfully redirected the rental income from
 the Properties, which were co-owned by the various family trusts,
 to Mary in her personal capacity. The Yonejis also alleged that
 Charlene was liable for conversion, unjust enrichment,
 conspiracy, constructive fraud, constructive trust, and prima
 facie tort for her involvement. On December 22, 2009, Mary and
 Charlene filed their Answer. On March 14, 2012, Mary's attorney
 turned over $152,772.46 to the circuit court pending the
 conclusion of litigation. Mary claims that the interpled funds
 included the $67,031.14 taken from the Mitsuo Trust Account.
 
On May 1, 2012, the circuit court filed a "Stipulation
 
For Appointment Of A Special Master." The Special Master was
 tasked with the following:
 1.	 [Conducting] an audit of the assets, revenues, and
expenses of the [Properties] from March 1, 2008 to
present.
 
2.	 [Determining] the interests of the co-owners of the
[Properties] and their past and present entitlement to
profits and responsibility for expenses.
 
3.	 [Determining] the final account among the co-owners,
taking into consideration all distributions and the
proceeds/credit from the sale of the [Properties].
 
4.	 [Determining] the parties' rights to the amounts
related to the [Properties] held, in custody and/or
control by any of the parties and the clerk of the
Court.
 
All parties also agreed that "the trier of fact shall rely on the
 
report of the Special Master in determining the amounts, if any,
 owed by and between all parties in [this] entitled action,
 subject to their determination of any disputed genuine issue of
 material fact (as set forth by the Court)[.]" On July 30, 2012,
 the circuit court issued its "Order Setting Trial Date" that
 ordered all exhibits to be delivered to the court and served by
 March 8, 2013.
 
On February 22, 2013, Charlene filed her Motion for
 
Summary Judgment (MSJ), which included a request for an award of
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 607-14.5 (Supp. 2014). On March 25, 2013, the Yonejis
 
filed their Opposition to the MSJ. In the Opposition, the
 
Yonejis withdrew all claims made in their individual capacities
 and argued that genuine issues of material fact remain, which
 would preclude summary judgment.
 
On April 2, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
the MSJ. During the hearing, the Yonejis noted to the court that
 many of the material issues in the case had not yet been
 determined because the Special Master had not yet issued his
 report. The circuit court orally granted the MSJ, finding "I
 don't understand why the master is taking as long as he is. But I
 don't -- I cannot imagine there would be something that the
 master would find in his focus and in his perspective regarding
 the accounting that would have any impact on the claims against
 Charlene Yoneji." In granting the MSJ, the circuit court noted
 that it was "adopting in full" the arguments that Charlene's
 counsel made in support of her MSJ.
 
On May 1, 2013, the circuit court reduced its decision 
to the written Order and Judgment. The court's Order also found that the Yonejis' claims against Charlene were frivolous and awarded Charlene reasonable attorneys fees of $49,117.33 and costs of $2,948.60. On January 27, 2014, the circuit court entered an Amended Judgment in favor of Charlene on all claims asserted by the Yonejis, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure. 
On February 25, 2014, the Yonejis filed a timely notice
 
of appeal.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant
 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107
 
Hawai'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005). 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Id. at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette v. Plastic Recycling,
 
Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
The Hawaii Supreme Court has set forth the following 
burden-shifting paradigm for situations where the non-movant
 bears the burden of proof at trial:
 '
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as
to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of
substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a
matter of law. This burden has two components.
 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing
support for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material
fact exists with respect to the essential elements of the
claim or defense which the motion seeks to establish or
 which the motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed
facts, it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law. Only when the moving party satisfies its initial
burden of production does the burden shift to the nonmoving
party to respond to the motion for summary judgment and
demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general
allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial.
 
Second, the moving party bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion. This burden always remains with the moving
party and requires the moving party to convince the court
that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the
moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law.
 
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai 'i 46, 56-57, 292 P.3d 1276, 1286-87 
(2013) (quoting French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 
462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 (2004)).
 
[A] summary judgment movant may satisfy his or her initial
burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence
negating an element of the non-movant's claim, or (2)
demonstrating that the nonmovant [sic] will be unable to
carry his or her burden of proof at trial. Where the movant
 attempts to meet his or her burden through the latter means,
he or she must show not only that the non-movant has not
placed proof in the record, but also that the movant will be
unable to offer proof at trial. Accordingly, in general, a
summary judgment movant cannot merely point to the
non-moving party's lack of evidence to support its initial
burden of production if discovery has not concluded.
 
Ralston, at 60-61, 292 P.3d at 1290-91 (citations and emphasis
 
omitted).
B. Award of Attorneys Fees and Costs
 
This court reviews a lower court's award of attorneys'
fees for abuse of discretion. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pruett,

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
118 Hawai' i 174, 179, 186 P.3d 609, 614 (2008) (citation
omitted). "The trial court abuses its discretion if it 
bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on aclearly erroneous assessment of the evidence." Id. (quoting 
Lepere v. United Pub. Workers, 77 Hawai' i 471, 473, 887 P.2d
1029, 1031 (1995)). In other words, "[a]n abuse ofdiscretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceededthe bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles oflaw or practice to the substantial detriment of a partylitigant." Id. (quoting TSA Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 
Hawai'i 243, 253, 990 P.2d 713, 723 (1999)). 
Hart v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 126 Hawai 'i 448, 455, 272 P.3d 
1215, 1222 (2012). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Conversion
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Charlene as to their conversion
 
claim against her.
 
Conversion is any distinct act of dominion wrongfully
exerted over another's personal property in denial of or
inconsistent with his rights therein, such as a tortious
taking of another's chattels, or any wrongful exercise or
assumption of authority, personally or by procurement, over
another's goods, depriving him of the possession permanently
or for an indefinite time.
 
Tsuru v. Bayer, 25 Haw. 693, 697 (Haw. Terr. 1920) "Conversion
 
encompasses the following acts: '(1) A taking from the owner
 without his consent; (2) an unwarranted assumption of ownership;
 (3) an illegal use or abuse of the chattel; and (4) a wrongful detention after demand.'" Freddy Nobriga Enterprises, Inc. v. 
State, Dep't of Hawaiian Home Lands, 129 Hawai
'i 123, 129, 295 
P.3d 993, 999 (App. 2013) (quoting Tsuru, 25 Haw. at 696); see also Sung v. Hamilton, 710 F. Supp. 2d 1036, 1044 (D. Hawai
'i 
2010); Pourny v. Maui Police Dep't, Cnty. of Maui, 127 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1146 (D. Hawai
'i 2000). 
Although Charlene declared in her affidavit that she 
did not intend to steal money from the Mitsuo Trust Account, such an intent was not necessary to support the Yonejis' conversion claim. See Freddy Nobriga, 129 Hawai
'i at 130, 295 P.3d at 1000 
(holding that the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands' mistaken belief that they owned defendant's cattle by reason of forfeiture was irrelevant to the defendant's conversion claim against the agency). Hawai
'i caselaw provides that "the defendant's 
knowledge, intent, motive, mistake, and good faith are generally 
6
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
irrelevant" to a conversion claim. Id. (quoting Morissette v. 
United States, 342 U.S. 246, 253 (1952)). See also Freddy 
Nobriga, 129 Hawai 'i at 130, 295 P.3d at 1000 ("So long as he [or 
she] intends to deal with the property in a way which is in fact 
inconsistent with the plaintiff's right, he [or she] is a converter." (quoting Federal Ins. Co. v. Fries, 78 Misc.2d 805, 806 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1974))). 
In Fries, the defendant was an heir to the decedent's
 
estate. The bank delivered to the defendant five rings worth
 $3,200, which the bank believed to be a part of the estate. The
 defendant then sold the rings to a jeweler five months later.
 Unbeknownst to the defendant, the bank had made a mistake and the
 rings were not part of the decedent's estate –- they were a part
 of someone else's estate. Two years after the defendant received
 the rings, the bank discovered its error and demanded the
 defendant return the rings. The defendant refused. The bank
 then assigned its claim against the defendant to a surety
 company. The surety company sought damages against the defendant
 for $3,200 on account of the defendant's conversion of the rings. 
Fries, 78 Misc.2d at 806.
 
The Fries court held that the defendant was liable for
 
conversion of the rings, even though "[the defendant] did nothing
 consciously wrong" and "accepted the rings and sold them without
 knowledge of the bank's error." Id. The Fries court opined that
 
"a converter need intend nothing evil" and that "[s]o long as he
 intends to deal with the property in a way which is in fact
 inconsistent with the plaintiff's right, he is a converter." Id.
 
The Fries court held that the defendant's intentional possession
 of the rings was sufficient to support the surety company's
 conversion claim against the defendant. 
Similarly here, Charlene need not have intended to
 
steal money from the Mitsuo Trust Account, she only needed to
 have "intend[ed] to deal with the property in a way which is in
 fact inconsistent" with the property rights of another. See id.
 
Charlene failed to offer any affirmative evidence showing that
 the Yonejis did not have an ownership interest in the funds in
 the Mitsuo Trust Account or that Charlene's endorsement of Mary's
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
check was not inconsistent with the Yonejis' ownership interest.
 
See Ralston at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290.
 
Furthermore, Charlene failed to demonstrate that the
 
Yonejis would be unable to carry their burden of proof at trial. 
See id. The MSJ contended that "[the Yonejis] must show there
 
are genuine issues of material facts as to all four (4) elements,
 but have failed to meet this burden for any one (1) of the same." 
(Emphasis in original.) In essence, the MSJ argued that because
 the Yonejis had not placed proof in the record, summary judgment
 was appropriate. This is a mischaracterization of the applicable
 standard.
 
As the movant, Charlene carried the initial burden of 
proof, as well as the ultimate burden of persuasion to show the circuit court that no genuine issue of material fact existed and that she was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. See Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i at 57, 292 P.3d at 1287. Furthermore, 
"a summary judgment movant cannot merely point to the non-moving party's lack of evidence to support its initial burden of production if discovery has not concluded." Id. at 61, 292 P.3d 
at 1291. In order for Charlene to demonstrate the Yonejis were unable to carry their burden of proof at trial, she was required to not only show that the Yonejis had not placed proof in the record, but also that they would be unable to offer proof at trial. Id. 
At the time Charlene submitted her MSJ, all parties
 
were still waiting for a stipulated report from a Special Master
 who was tasked with
 
1.	 [Conducting] an audit of the assets, revenues, and
expenses of the [Properties] from March 1, 2008 to
present.
 
2.	 [Determining] the interests of the co-owners of the
[Properties] and their past and present entitlement to
profits and responsibility for expenses.
 
3.	 [Determining] the final account among the co-owners,
taking into consideration all distributions and the
proceeds/credit from the sale of the [Properties].
 
4.	 [Determining] the parties' rights to the amounts
related to the [Properties] held, in custody and/or
control by any of the parties and the clerk of the
Court.
 
8
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Both parties had agreed that "the trier of fact shall rely on the
 
report of the Special Master in determining the amounts, if any,
 owed by and between all parties in [this] entitled action,
 subject to their determination of any disputed genuine issue of
 material fact (as set forth by the Court)[.]" In brief, the
 Special Master's report was intended to determine just the type
 of genuine issues of material fact that the MSJ claimed did not
 exist.
2 Therefore, the MSJ failed to show the Yonejis would have
 
been unable to offer proof in support of their conversion claim
 at trial and the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment
 in Charlene's favor. See Ralston at 61, 292 P.3d at 1291. 
B. Unjust Enrichment

 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Charlene as to the unjust enrichment
 claims against her.
 
Unjust enrichment, as a claim for relief, is not
clearly defined in either the Hawaii Revised Statutes or our
jurisprudence. As far as we can tell, our best explanation
of unjust enrichment has been as follows:
 
It is a truism that "[a] person confers a benefit upon
another if he gives to the other possession of or some
other interest in money, land, chattels, or [choses]
in action, . . . , or in any way adds to the other's
security or advantage."• Restatement of Restitution
§ 1 comment b (1937). One who receives a benefit is
 of course enriched, and he would be unjustly enriched
if its retention would be unjust. Id. § 1 comment a.
And it is axiomatic that "[a] person who has been
unjustly enriched at the expense of another is
required to make restitution to the other."• Id. § 1.
We realize unjust enrichment is a broad and imprecise
term defying definition. But in deciding whether
there should be restitution here, we are guided by the
underlying conception of restitution, the prevention
of injustice. See A. Denning, The Changing Law 65
 
(1953).
 
Durette, 105 Hawai 'i at 502, 100 P.3d at 72 (emphasis omitted) 
(quoting Small v. Badenhop, 67 Haw. 626, 635–36, 701 P.2d 647,
 
654 (1985)); See Porter v. Hu, 116 Hawai 'i 42, 55, 169 P.3d 994, 
1007 (App. 2007). A "claim for unjust enrichment requires only
 
2
 We note that during the April 2, 2013 hearing on the MSJ, the
Yonejis repeatedly argued that the circuit court should wait for the Special
Master's report before ruling on the MSJ. We construe the Yonejis' statementsas an oral request for continuance under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
56(f). Given the significance of the Special Master's report to thedetermination of material facts in the Yonejis' case against Charlene, thecircuit court should have at least waited until the Special Master's reportwas issued before ruling on the MSJ. 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that a plaintiff prove that he or she conferred a benefit upon 
the opposing party and that the retention of that benefit would be unjust."• Durette, 105 Hawai
'i at 504, 100 P.3d at 74 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). The Yonejis claim that Charlene received an unjust benefit from her involvement in removing money from the Mitsuo Trust Account. 
The MSJ contended that "Charlene did not keep, use,
 
retain, or benefit from those funds." In support of her MSJ,
 Charlene pointed to a transcript of Neil's January 11, 2013
 deposition to show that "[Neil] does not know if Charlene used
 any of the funds for her own or anyone else's benefit." During
 Neil's deposition, Charlene's counsel elicited the following
 responses from Neil:
 
Q: Do you know whether or not she used any
of those funds personally for her benefit or in
any way?
 
A: I don't know. I don't not know where
 
the funds are.
 
Q: Okay. You have no knowledge if she used
those funds at all, correct?
 
A: No. The answer is no. I have no
 
knowledge.
 
Q: Okay. Has anybody told you or do you
have any other information from anyone else that
would lead you to believe that she used the
funds for her own benefit or anybody else's
benefit?
 
A: Do I know? No.
 
As we have mentioned supra, Charlene cannot satisfy her
 
initial burden of production by merely pointing to the Yonejis'
 
lack of evidence in the record, especially because the Special
 Master's report was still outstanding. See Ralston at 60-61, 292
 
P.3d at 1290-91. Therefore, the MSJ failed to satisfy her burden
 of production and the circuit court erred in granting summary
 judgment in favor of Charlene as to the Yonejis' unjust
 enrichment claim. 
C. Constructive Fraud
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Charlene as to their constructive
 
fraud claim. "Constructive fraud is defined as an act done or
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted which is construed as a fraud by the court because of its
 
detrimental effect upon public interests and public or private
 confidence, even though the act is not done or omitted with an
 actual design to perpetrate actual fraud or injury." Wolfer v.
 
Mut. Life Ins. Co. of New York, 3 Haw. App. 65, 76, 641 P.2d
 1349, 1357 (1982). 
"Constructive fraud is characterized by the breach of 
fiduciary or confidential relationship." Aames Funding Corp. v. 
Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 104, 110 P.3d 1042, 1051 (2005) (quoting 
Honolulu Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Murphy, 7 Haw. App. 196, 201 n.6, 753 P.2d 807, 811 n.6 (1988)). "Relationships between trustee and beneficiary, principal and agent, and attorney and client are familiar examples in which the principle of fiduciary or confidential relationship applies in its strictest sense." Wolfer, 3 Haw. App. at 76 641 P.2d at 1357; see Silva v. Bisbee, 2 Haw. App. 188, 190, 628 P.2d 214, 216 (1981) (holding that constructive fraud occurred where brokers with a fiduciary relationship with their client failed to disclose to the client their pecuniary interest in the purchase of the property). "Its operation, however, is not limited to dealings between parties standing in such relations, but extends to all instances when a fiduciary or confidential relation exists as a fact, in which there is confidence reposed on one side and a resulting superiority and influence on the other." Wolfer, 3 Haw. App. at 
76-77, 641 P.2d at 1357. 
The MSJ argued that Charlene was "entitled to summary
 
judgment since she did not engaged [sic] in any conduct that can
 be viewed as a fraud or because of its detrimental effect upon
 the public interests and public or private confidence, she did
 not benefit from any alleged wrongful conduct, and she did not
 take advantage of or breach any special/confidential/fiduciary
 relationship." In support of the allegations in the MSJ,
 Charlene only cited to Neil's deposition, indicating that at the
 time he did not know whether Charlene received any benefit from
 endorsing the check to Owen, and Charlene's own affidavit,
 denying that she stole money from the Mitsuo Trust Account. The
 MSJ presented no affirmative evidence that would negate the
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Yonejis' claim against Charlene nor did she show that the Yonejis
 
would be unable to place proof in the record necessary for their
 constructive fraud claim at trial. See Ralston at 60-61, 292
 
P.3d at 1290-91. Charlene again did not satisfy her initial
 burden of production and therefore failed to show that no genuine
 issue of material fact existed to warrant summary judgment as a
 matter of law. 
D. Conspiracy
 
The Yonejis claim the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Charlene as to their conspiracy
 
claim because "[t]he summary judgment evidence considered by the
 Circuit Court in this case established
 that Charlene engaged in a civil conspiracy – or, at the very
 least, that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary
 judgment."
 
"Generally speaking, 'the accepted definition of a
 
conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons [or entities]
 by concerted action to accomplish a criminal or unlawful purpose,
 or to accomplish some purpose not in itself criminal or unlawful
 by criminal or unlawful means.'" Robert's Hawaii Sch. Bus, Inc.
 
v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai
'i 224, 252 n.28, 982 P.2d 
853, 881 n.28 (1999), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel Ltd., 122 Hawai
'i 423, 430, 
228 P.3d 303, 310 (2010); see Menashe v. Bank of New York, 850 F. Supp. 2d 1120, 1138 (D. Hawai
'i 2012). "Because 'there can be no 
civil claim based upon a conspiracy alone,' a plaintiff must allege an underlying actionable claim." Menashe, 850 F. Supp. 2d 
at 1138 (quoting Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 Hawai
'i 40, 49, 890 P.2d 
277, 286 (1995)); see Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 57, 451 P.2d 814, 822-23 (1969) (holding that the plaintiffs' failure to allege an underlying claim of deceit precluded them from alleging conspiracy to deceive). 
The MSJ contended Charlene was entitled to summary
 
judgment on the Yonejis' conspiracy claim because "there is no
 actionable or underlying claim against Charlene and there was
 never any criminal or unlawful purpose of any act by Charlene. 
There was no unjust enrichment, conversion, or constructive
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fraud." Because we hold the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment as to the Yonejis' conversion, unjust
 enrichment, and constructive fraud claims, Charlene's argument is
 without merit. The MSJ presented no affirmative evidence to
 negate the Yonejis' conspiracy claim nor did Charlene show that
 the Yonejis would be unable to place proof in the record
 necessary for their claim. See Ralston at 60-61, 292 P.3d at
 
1290-91. Therefore, summary judgment as to the Yonejis'
 conspiracy claim was also erroneous.
E. Prima Facie Tort
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Charlene as to their prima facie
 
tort claim against her. The Yonejis cite to this court's opinion
 in Giuliani v. Chuck, 1 Haw. App. 379, 620 P.2d 733 (1980) in
 support of their prima facie tort claim against Charlene. The
 MSJ fails to cite to any facts in favor of summary judgment, but
 instead, states that "[the Yonejis'] claim of a 'prima facie
 tort' is unclear to Charlene's counsel. However, to the extent
 it may be a cognizable claim, it is not supported by any evidence
 that raises any genuine issue of material fact for any tortious
 conduct on the part of Charlene." 
In Giuliani, plaintiffs brought suit against a
 
homeowner's attorney for allegedly willfully usurping their
 rights to a contract and refusing to return their $1,000 deposit
 after the sale of the homeowner's home to the plaintiffs fell
 through. Giuliani, 1 Haw. App. at 381-82, 620 P.2d at 735-36. 
The plaintiffs claimed that the attorney's actions compelled them
 to "needlessly enter into litigation to defend their property and
 rights which, in turn, caused [them] mental anguish as well as
 deprivation of enjoyment over a long period of time." Id. at
 
382, 620 P.2d at 736. The plaintiffs alleged no other cause of
 action against the attorney. Id. at 386, 620 P.2d at 738. This
 
court held that, pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts § 871
 (§ 871), the plaintiffs had sufficiently pled a cause of action
 
for "intentional harm to a property interest," which this court
 
determined was a cognizable cause of action sounding in tort. 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Guiliani, 1 Haw. App. at 386, 620 P.2d at 738. In support of its
 
decision, this court cited to § 871, which provides that
 
[o]ne who intentionally deprives another of his legally
protected property interest or causes injury to the interest
is subject to liability to the other if his conduct is
generally culpable and not justifiable under the
circumstances.
 
Id. Notably, this court justified its conclusion that the
 
plaintiffs had sufficiently pled a cause of action under § 871 by
 
noting that the plaintiffs insufficiently pled any other cause of
 action. Id. Ultimately, this court remanded the case back to
 
the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with the
 opinion. Id.
 It is unclear whether the Giuliani court intended to 
create a broad prima facie tort claim, as the Yonejis suggest, or whether that court intended to create a narrow intentional tort for "intentional harm to a property interest," under § 871, when similar facts arise. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has not addressed 
this issue and no other State court has cited to § 871 as a separate tort. 
Upon further review of Giuliani's facts and analysis,
 
we hold that Giuliani did not create a broad prima facie tort
 cause of action, as the Yonejis suggest. Instead, this court
 recognized a cause of action for intentional harm to a property
 interest, under § 871, that narrowly applies to cases that are
 factually similar to Giuliani and where no other well-recognized
 causes of action are pled to address the alleged harm. See
 
Giuliani, 1 Haw. App. at 386, 620 P.2d at 738.
 
Here, the Yonejis' prima facie tort claim states:
 
COUNT IV
 
PRIMA FACIE TORT

 
39.
 Paragraphs 1 through 38 are incorporated herein by
reference as though fully realleged hereat [sic].
 
40. The foregoing acts and omissions of Defendants,
acting in concert and/or with one or more Doe Defendants,
were unjustified and performed with intent to cause injury
to the interests of Plaintiffs.
 
41. Additionally, Defendants acting in concert and/or
with one or more Doe Defendants, are jointly and severally
liable for damages suffered by Plaintiffs as a result of the
aforementioned unjustified acts.
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
42. As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid
prima facie tort, Plaintiffs have suffered and are entitled
to recover compensatory damages from the above-named
Defendants and/or one or more Doe Defendants, including
special, general, consequential and punitive damages in an
amount to be proven at trial, together with an award of
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and interest.
 
The financial harm alleged in the Yonejis' complaint could be 
remedied by the Yonejis' conversion claim against Charlene. See 
Freddy Nobriga, 129 Hawai 'i at 130, 295 P.3d at 1000. Therefore, 
under our interpretation of Giuliani, the Yonejis' prima facie tort claim must fail as a matter of law. See Giuliani, 1 Haw. 
App. at 386, 620 P.2d at 738. The circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Charlene as to the Yonejis' prima facie tort claim.
F. Constructive Trust
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred when it
 
granted summary judgment on their constructive trust claim in
 
favor of Charlene because a genuine issue of material fact
 remained as to whether "all the original monies taken from the
 original Mitsuo Trust Account had been interpled with the court,
 and, therefore, whether a constructive trust would still need to
 be imposed on additional funds." The Yonejis argue that there
 was no way of knowing whether all the money from the Mitsuo Trust
 Account had been accounted for at the time that Charlene
 submitted her MSJ, because all parties were still waiting for the
 Special Master's report.
 
"A constructive trust will be imposed where the
 
evidence is clear and convincing that one party will be unjustly
 enriched if allowed to retain the entire property." Maria v.
 
Freitas, 73 Haw. 266, 274, 832 P.2d 259, 264 (1992). The only
 argument Charlene made in favor of summary judgment as to the
 Yonejis' constructive trust claim was that (1) "[she] has not
 been unjustly enriched or enriched" and (2) "[s]he is not holding
 nor controls any funds claimed by Plaintiffs." Charlene provided
 no evidence or affidavits to support the assertions made in the
 MSJ. 
The MSJ failed to present any affirmative evidence to
 
negate any elements of the Yonejis' constructive trust claim and
 Charlene failed to show that the Yonejis would be unable to place
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proof in the record, given that all parties were still waiting on
 
the Special Master's report. See Ralston at 60-61, 292 P.3d at
 
1290-91. Charlene failed to satisfy her initial burden of
 production, thus, the circuit court erred in granting summary
 judgment in her favor as to the Yonejis' constructive trust
 claim.
 
G. Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
The Yonejis claim the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in awarding Charlene attorneys' fees and costs because
 
(1) "the entry of summary judgment was improper and/or premature,
 (2) the Yonejis' claims were not frivolous, and (3) the fees
 awarded were unreasonable." We agree. 
The circuit court's order found that "pursuant to [HRS]
 
§ 607-14.5, that all claims by all Plaintiffs against [Charlene]
 were and are frivolous, and not reasonably supported by the facts
 and the law[.]" The circuit court awarded reasonable attorneys'
 fees of $49,117.33 and costs of $2,948.60 to Charlene and against
 the Yonejis.
 
Under HRS § 607-14.5(a),
 
[i]n any civil action . . . where a party seeks money
damages or injunctive relief, or both, against another
party, and the case is subsequently decided, the court may,
as it deems just, assess against either party, whether or
not the party was a prevailing party, and enter as part of
its order . . . a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and
costs, in an amount to be determined by the court upon a
specific finding that all or a portion of the party's
claim . . . was frivolous . . . .
 
See Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawai 'i 292, 
300, 972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999). "A frivolous claim has been 
defined as 'a claim so manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the pleader's part such that argument to the court was not required.'" Id. (citing Coll v. McCarthy, 
72 Haw. 20, 29, 804 P.2d 881, 887 (1991)). Given our holding that Charlene was not entitled to summary judgment as to five of the Yonejis' six claims against her, the circuit court erred in finding that the Yonejis' claims against her were frivolous. See 
Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai
'i 43, 69, 85 P.3d 150, 176 (2004). 
The circuit court abused its discretion in granting Charlene's request for attorneys' fees and costs.
