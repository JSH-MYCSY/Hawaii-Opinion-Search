IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
 
GARY T. PAIK, Defendant-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
 
(CASE NO. 3DTA-12-01602)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Gary T. Paik appeals from the
 
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed January 29, 2014
 
 
in the District Court of the Third Circuit, North/South Hilo
 
 
Division ("District Court").1/ Paik was convicted of Operating a
 
 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant in violation of
 
 
 Hawaii Revised Statutes section 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010).2/

  
On appeal, Paik contends that the District Court erred
 
 
in denying his motion to compel production with regard to service
 
 
records of the Intoxilyzer machine that was used to determine his
 
 
intoxication level. Specifically, Paik argues that
 
 
given that the Intoxilyzer is a mechanical and electronic
 . . . measuring device whose functions were inherently subject
to deterioration, drift, and environmental influences and that
Intoxilyzer serial number 68-011667 was alleged to have
 remained in uninterrupted service without a single
malfunction, adjustment, or re-calibration over the span of
nearly four years, the limited discovery requested should have
been provided.
 
In light of the Intoxilyzer service record information provided
 
1/
 The Honorable Harry P.N. Freitas presided.
 
2/
 "A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical
control of a vehicle: . . . (3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat § 291E-61(a)(3).

 Paik contends that the State's failure to produce the requested
evidence violated his rights to due process under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.
83 (1963). Paik fails to identify, and we do not discern, where in the recordhe raised that objection below. Accordingly, this argument is deemed waived.
