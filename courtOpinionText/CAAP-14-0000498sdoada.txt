On appeal, Elizares claims  the District Court erred by
denying his Motion to Compel because the documents he sought were

 
necessary for his defense. Elizares specifically sought the
 
January 2008 through August 24, 2012 intoxilyzer maintenance and
 calibration records for the specific Intoxilyzer machine used in
 this case. Elizares sought these records to ensure that the
 equipment was properly maintained and in proper working order
 when the accuracy test was conducted.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Elizares's point of error as follows:
 
The District Court did not err by denying the Motion to 
Compel. Discovery in non-felony criminal cases is governed by Rule 16(d) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). State 
v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304, 308, 788 P.2d 1281, 1284 (1990). Discovery
 may be permitted by the court upon a showing of materiality and
 if the request is reasonable but only to the extent authorized by
 HRPP Rule 16 in felony cases. Id. at 309, 788 P.2d at 1284. 
In Ames, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that the trial 
court exceeded its authority under HRPP Rule 16(d) when it ordered disclosure of, inter alia, 
16. A copy of all repair, calibration, and
maintenance records and memoranda (including the permanent
record book and repair invoices) for the Intoxilyzer 4011AS
used in this case for the 30 days preceding and 30 days
subsequent to the date of the Defendant's test; and the
original records for the life of the Intoxilyzer 4011AS used
in this case to be made available for inspection and
photocopying by Defendant's attorney. (Citation omitted).
 
Id. at 315, 788 P.2d at 1287. 
In his Motion to Compel, Elizares alleged that, based
 
on his attorney's review of his attorney's case files, it
 
2
 Elizares's point on appeal fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). "[S]uch noncompliance offers sufficientgrounds for the dismissal of the appeal." Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v.
Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111 (1999) (citing Bettencourt v.
Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 228, 909 P.2d 553, 556 (1995)). "Nonetheless,
inasmuch as 'this court has consistently adhered to the policy of affordinglitigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, wherepossible,' [Bettencourt] at 230, 909 P.2d at 558 (citation and internalquotations omitted), we address the issues [Appellant] raise[d] on themerits." Id. at 85-86, 979 P.2d at 1111-12. Counsel is cautioned that future 
violations may result in sanctions.

appeared that, while the machine used to test him had
 
"occasionally malfunction[ed]" prior to 2008, it had not been
 taken out of service for maintenance due to malfunction since
 2008. Upon these averments, Elizares argued that Ames was
 distinguishable because under the circumstances of this case he
 was entitled to examine the records of required testing and
 maintenance to determine whether the strict compliance with
 administrative rules had been performed.
 
Elizares acknowledged that he had received in discovery
 
the "Sworn Statement of the Intoxilyzer Supervisor," which stated
 that the machine in question had been properly maintained and
 calibrated and that, on March 15, 2012 an accuracy test had been
 conducted on the machine in question and it was in proper working
 order on that date. He also acknowledged that the prosecution
 provides the test cards documenting tests conducted within thirty
 days prior to and thirty days after the alcohol breath test. 
The District Court based its ruling on the understanding that
 these test cards are provided by the prosecution and Elizares
 does not contest that on appeal.
 
Title 11 Chapter 114 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules

(HAR) governs the use of alcohol breath testing instruments. 
3	 HAR ยง 11-114-7 states:
 
ยง11-114-7 Accuracy tests. (a) Every accuracy test
procedure shall be approved by the DUI coordinator in
writing and shall include, but not be limited to the
following requirements:
 
(1)	 The test shall be conducted by a supervisor;
 
(2)	 At least two different reference samples and an
air blank shall be run with each accuracy test;
 
(3)	 Reference samples shall be chosen so that their
target values are not less than 0.04gm alcohol
/210 liters and not greater than 0.25gm alcohol
/210 liters;
 
(4)	 Reference sample target values shall differ from
each other by at least 0.04gm alcohol /210
liters;
 
(5)	 Reference sample test results which vary from
the target value by more than plus or minus
0.01gm alcohol /210 liters or plus or minus ten
percent, whichever is greater, shall be cause
for the breath alcohol testing instrument used
(continued...)

However, whether the Intoxilyzer used to test Elizares was
 
previously repaired or taken out of service at any time since
 2008 is not material. Elizares was provided with the accuracy
 test results no more than thirty days prior to and after his
 alcohol breath test. Elizares admitted that those tests results
 were accurate. Therefore, Elizares was not entitled to further
 discovery under HRPP Rule 16(d) because the requested discovery
 was not material.
 
Elizares also argues that the information he sought
 
contained exculpatory evidence "which would have ultimately
 resulted in the suppression of the breath test result." 
"[S]uppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an
 accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is
 material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the
 good faith or bad faith of the prosecution." State v. Moriwaki,
 
71 Haw. 347, 356, 791 P.2d 392, 397 (1990) (quoting Brady v.
 Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L. Ed. 2d
 215 (1963)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Evidence is
 material "only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the
 evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the
 proceeding would have been different. A 'reasonable probability'
 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the
 outcome." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Where compliance with the regulatory requirements show that the
 machine in question was in good working order when used in this
 case, a request for the maintenance and calibration records for
 the previous five years fails to meet this standard. As the
 discovery sought by Elizares is not material, it is not
 
3(...continued)
 
to be removed from service until the fault has
 
been corrected; and
 
(6)	 An accuracy test shall be performed on an
operating instrument at intervals not to exceed
thirty-one days.
 
(b) Operating instruments do not include instruments
in storage or being repaired. Upon return to operation from
storage or repair an accuracy test shall be performed.

exculpatory and was not required to be produced by the
