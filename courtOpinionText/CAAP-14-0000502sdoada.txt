 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on January 9,
 
2014 and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Entry of
 Default Judgment entered October 17, 2013 and to Set Aside
 Judgments (Order Denying Reconsideration).
 
Metcalfe raises three points of error on appeal,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred when it: (1) granted
 summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Central Pacific
 Bank (CPB) because there were genuine issues of material fact in
 
dispute as to whether Metcalfe was in default; (2) granted
 
summary judgment in favor of CPB because CPB failed to present a
 prima facie case for foreclosure; and (3) denied reconsideration.
 Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the
 parties and having given due consideration to the arguments
 advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve
 Metcalfe's points of error as follows:
 
(1 & 2) Default was entered against Metcalfe on April
 
4, 2013 due to Metcalfe's failure to answer the complaint. CPB's
 first motion for summary judgment and interlocutory decree of
 foreclosure (First Summary Judgment Motion) was filed on May 7,
 
2013 and heard by the Circuit Court on June 5, 2013, at the same
 
time as Metcalfe's first motion to set aside entry of default.
 The April 4, 2013 entry of default was set aside. The First
 Summary Judgment Motion was denied based on one issue, i.e., that
 there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CPB had
 agreed to accept a lower payment amount during the period of time
 that Metcalfe was attempting to negotiate a second loan
 modification.
 
Thereafter, on June 14, 2013, through their respective
 
attorneys, CPB sent Metcalfe a letter informing him that his
 (second) loan modification application was incomplete, that CPB
 was not considering a further loan modification or forebearance
 on foreclosure, and would not accept partial payments on
 Metcalfe's account. CPB provided Metcalfe with a statement of
 the balance due and payable on his loan, not including attorneys'
 fees, and returned Metcalfe's check dated June 6, 2013, in the
 amount of $3,153.34, which purported to be a "hardship payment."

  [CPB] satisfied the one element of notice by
submitting [the June 14, 2013 letter]. And you've put
nothing in this regard to contradict that, and that's your
burden.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Metcalfe again failed to answer the complaint and default was
 
again entered on October 17, 2013. 
On October 23, 2013, CPB filed a second motion for
 
summary judgment, which included, inter alia, the June 14, 2013
 notice letter. Metcalfe again sought to set aside default and
 filed a memorandum in opposition to CPB's motion for summary
 judgment. At the December 11, 2013 hearing on the matter,
 although considering Metcalfe's opposition to summary judgment,
 as well as his request for relief from the second entry of
 default, the Circuit Court granted CPB's motion and denied
 Metcalfe's motion, explaining to Metcalfe that, with the second
 motion for summary judgment:
 
. . . .

 
You've presented no evidence that you've brought the
loan current, that they have actually agreed to the
modification in writing. You've presented nothing.
. . . .
 So, I do think you've proven it, [CPB]. You've
 
satisfied the last element. There are no material questions
of fact in dispute based upon [the June 14, 2013 letter],
which is in the record. Mr. Metcalfe, you've presented
arguments, but you haven't presented facts. . . . 
On appeal, Metcalfe argues that the same issues raised
 
by the Circuit Court at the June 5, 2013 hearing still exist
 
because there was a dispute as to whether there was a default
 during the modification period. This argument is without merit. 
As Metcalfe was clearly informed, the modification period was
 over, no further modification or forbearance was agreed to, and
 Metcalfe was in default on his loan payments. Metcalfe fails to
 identify any other element that CPB failed to establish prima
 facie and we find none. 
Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not
 
err in entering the Foreclosure Order.

(3) On appeal, Metcalfe argues that the Circuit Court 
erred in denying reconsideration of the Foreclosure Order, and 
the order denying his second motion to set aside, because he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel when his first attorney misadvised him as to whether and when he had to answer the complaint. Even assuming Metcalfe's initial counsel was grossly negligent and/or ineffective with regard to the defaults, Metcalfe failed, inter alia, to establish a meritorious defense to the Foreclosure Order and, thus, was not entitled to relief. See Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 438-39, 
16 P.3d 827, 843-44 (2000). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in entering

 
the Order Denying Reconsideration.
 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's January 9, 2014
 
Judgment is affirmed.
