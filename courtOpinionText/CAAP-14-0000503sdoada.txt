OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ALLEN VIDAL, Claimant-Appellant, v. STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORATION, Employer-Appellee, Self Insured,
and SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-036 (2-04-41062))

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Through his notice of appeal filed on February 26, 
2014, Claimant-Appellant Allen Vidal (Vidal), pro se, appeals 
from a series of decisions of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). Based on this vaguely worded notice that does not identify any judgments or final orders, it appears that, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88 (2015) and HRS § 91-14(a) (2012 and Supp. 2015) and Tam v. Kaiser Permanente, 94 Hawai
'i 487, 494-95, 17 P.3d 219, 226-27 (2001), we have 
appellate jurisdiction over Vidal's appeal from the following two orders by the LIRAB that collectively resolved the administrative appeal before the LIRAB in Case No. AB 2009-036: 
(1) a May 2, 2012 decision and order affirming the
 
Director of Labor and Industrial Relations's (Director)
 January 26, 2009 decision suspending a determination of the
 compensability of Vidal's claim pursuant to HRS § 386-79 (2015)
 and Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-10-75 until such time
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as Vidal complies with the Director's prior May 19, 2005 order
 
requiring Vidal to submit to a medical examination (May 2012
 Decision and Order), and
 
(2)
 a December 27, 2013 "disposition order"
 
(a) acknowledging that the Department of Transportation (DOT)
 withdrew its request for review of the Director's denial of DOT's
 request for reimbursement of a no-show fee that a physician had
 assessed against DOT and (b) declaring that the LIRAB had
 adjudicated all issues in Case No. AB 2009-036 (December 2013
 Disposition Order).
 
We address the arguments presented by Vidal as they pertain to

 
these orders.1
 
A.	 Res Judicata does not apply to Vidal's instant
appeal.
 
Vidal argues in his March 13, 2014 and April 4, 2014
 
filings that this court's April 9, 2008 memorandum opinion in
 
appeal No. 28363 (Memorandum Opinion), wherein this court decided
 the LIRAB was incorrect in ruling in its Decision and Order that
 Vidal's workers' compensation claim was time-barred by HRS § 386­
1 Vidal's filings, filed on March 13, 2014, March 18, 2014,
March 21, 2014, April 4, 2014, and April 11, 2014, none of which are entitled
an opening brief, do not individually or collectively comply with Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) in any respect. Moreover, suchfilings, at least those filed after the first, March 13, 2014 "OpeningStatement," which we will construe as Vidal's opening brief, were notauthorized by rule or order of this court. Such a wholesale violation of ourrules is grounds for sanction, including dismissal of the appeal. HRAP Rule 30; Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85, 979 P.2d
1107, 1111 (1999) ("[S]uch noncompliance offers sufficient grounds for thedismissal of the appeal.") (citing Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225,
228, 909 P.2d 553, 556 (1995)). 
However, in light of our policy to decide cases on the merits
where possible, Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558, we will
attempt to address the matters raised by Vidal to the extent we can ascertainthem. As we have limited our consideration to those matters bearing on theLIRAB's orders pertaining to Vidal's failure to submit to an independentmedical examination (IME), we do not consider his representation of factsregarding his work conditions. We therefore deny Vidal's motion filed onJune 4, 2014 asking this court to take judicial notice of these facts. 
We point out that court rules are designed, not only to aid the
court in its orderly, fair, and expeditious disposition of cases, but to
assist the parties and their attorneys in presenting their claims and
arguments in the best possible light. Vidal is cautioned that in future, he
must consult the appropriate rules of court and comply with them or face the
possibility of sanctions.

82 and remanded this case to the LIRAB for further proceedings,
 
was "res judicata." Vidal does not articulate clearly how res
 judicata applies to the Memorandum Opinion. Suffice it to say
 that none of the actions or decisions of the LIRAB or this court
 are inconsistent with the Memorandum Opinion and therefore Vidal
 has not shown how the May 2012 Decision and Order or the December
 2013 Disposition Order were precluded by res judicata.
 
B.
	 Vidal's argument that his VA disability
determination is dispositive of his state workers'
compensation claim is without merit.
 
Vidal argues in his March 21, 2014 filing that in his 
opinion, these public laws and the Code of Federal
Regulations are in fact part of the Constitution of these
United States and therefore is the supreme law(s) of the
land. These law(s) preempts[sic] the State Law HRS 386-79
which suspended my benefits. Therefore the State of Hawaii
 Department of Labor and Industrial Relations is in gross
error by ignoring this disability awarded on December 8,
2003 by the Department of Veterans Affairs of 100%, with
"The Seal"; where no court in these United States may ignore
the a [sic] certificate of disability under The Code of
Federal Regulations, part of the Constitution of These
United States. 
Vidal does not explain how a determination of
 
disability for veterans' benefits precludes a state determination
 
of eligibility for state workers' compensation benefits. The
 Director is granted exclusive power and jurisdiction over state
 workers' compensation claims pursuant to HRS § 386-73 (2015).
2
   
Vidal does not dispute that he was lawfully employed by the DOT. 
See HRS § 386-1 (defining employment). Therefore, Vidal's
 employment at Honolulu International Airport falls within the
 scope of chapter 386 and Vidal's claim is correctly heard by the
 Director. 
2
 § 386-73 Original jurisdiction over
controversies.  Unless otherwise provided, the
director of labor and industrial relations shall have
 
original jurisdiction over all controversies and
disputes arising under this chapter. The decisions of
 the director shall be enforceable by the circuit court
as provided in section 386-91. There shall be a right
of appeal from the decisions of the director to the
appellate board and thence to the intermediate
appellate court, subject to chapter 602, as provided
in sections 386-87 and 386-88, but in no case shall an
appeal operate as a supersedeas or stay unless the
appellate board or the appellate court so orders.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
By contrast, 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (2012), to which Vidal
 
cites, provides disability ratings for "wartime disability
 
compensation." Moreover, while 38 U.S.C. § 511(a) (2012),
 provides that decisions made by the Secretary of the Department
 Veterans Affairs (VA) are final and unreviewable "by any other
 official or by any court, whether by an action in the nature of
 mandamus or otherwise[,]" this determination applies to "all
 questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the
 Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by
 the Secretary to veterans or the dependents or survivors of
 veterans" (emphasis added). Thus, this conclusive determination
 by the VA is limited to VA benefits.
 
Vidal's argument that Title 38 of the United States
 
Code governing veterans' benefits takes precedence over a
 determination by the Director for a state workers' compensation
 claim, is without merit.
 
C.	 HRS § 386-79 does not present any conflicts with
other agencies and their independent disability
ratings or "the current medical system."
 
Vidal also maintains that in his opinion, the
 
legislature's intent in permitting IMEs pursuant to HRS § 386-79
 
"was not to create a medical re-evaluation that would deprive the
 person of social security or retirement benefits but to determine
 the health rating for workers compensation benefits" and that HRS
 § 386-79 "does not address the close relationship of other
 benefits and the percentage system of the HRS chapter 386 does
 and will affect any medical ratings of all other benefits of the
 same injury." Vidal apparently believes that a determination of
 injury or lack of injury following an IME ordered pursuant to HRS
 § 386-79 will somehow affect his disability rating found by the
 VA. However, Vidal points to no evidence in the record nor legal
 authority for his assertion that a determination on his workers'
 compensation claim would have any effect on his eligibility for
 any other benefits, state or federal.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nor is it clear what Vidal means when he argues that
 
HRS § 386-79 is in conflict with the current medical system. It
 
is clear that the intent of the legislature in enacting HRS
 § 386-79 was to allow the Director to order a claimant to submit
 to an IME. Should a claimant refuse to do so, HRS § 386-79
 permits the Director to suspend a determination of injury.
3
 
Pursuant to HRS § 386-79, Vidal "shall have the right
 
to have a physician or surgeon designated and paid by [himself]
 present at the examination." Vidal appears to argue that it is
 impracticable, if not impossible to have his VA doctor attend the
 IME ordered by the Director. However, Vidal does not provide
 record citations to where in the record he raised this argument
 or where evidence of his factual allegations underlying this
 argument were presented to either the Director or the LIRAB. As
 there are no transcripts of the hearing before the LIRAB in the
 record, we are unable to review what was presented. Therefore,
 Vidal's inability to arrange for his VA doctor to attend his IME
 does not present a viable legal or factual challenge to the
 Director's authority to suspend a determination of compensation.
 
D.	 Vidal has not been denied due process due to the
suspension of a determination of his workers'
compensation claim.
 
Vidal also claims he is being denied due process: 
Not all the evidence in this case was determined and
 
commented on by the tribunal such as the criminal activities
 
3	 HRS § 386-79 provides, in pertinent part, 
After an injury and during the period of disability, the
employee, whenever ordered by the director of labor and
industrial relations, shall submit to examination, at
reasonable times and places, by a duly qualified physician
or surgeon designated and paid by the employer. The
 employee shall have the right to have a physician or surgeon
designated and paid by the employee present at the
examination, which right, however, shall not be construed to
deny to the employers' physician the right to visit the
injured employee at all reasonable times and under all
reasonable conditions during total disability.
 
If an employee refuses to submit to, or in any way
obstructs such examination, the employee's right to claim
compensation for the work injury shall be suspended until
the refusal or obstruction ceases and no compensation shall
be payable for the period during which the refusal or
obstruction continues.

of the management and the acts of war by another country
which among other evidence was not acted on and not
mentioned mainly the Code of Federal Regulations which was
part of the creation of a certificate of disability of 100%
disability which enabled this claim in the first place
(Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulation) the preamble
states that the Code will be recognized in all Courts of Law
in the United States. Therefore I did not receive "Due
 Process" and my civil right(s) has been violated according
to the ADA laws of these United States.
 
A similar argument was presented by the appellant in Tam v. 
Kaiser Permanente, 94 Hawai 'i 487, 17 P.3d 219 (2001). In Tam, 
the appellant argued that the DLIR director's decision to suspend a determination of workers' compensation compensability was in error, because its "medical examination order was constitutionally defective and, therefore, unenforceable[.]" Id. 
at 490, 17 P.3d at 222. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court disagreed with 
Tam's argument, holding that the DLIR director's ordered medical examination "did not deprive Tam of any property interest in worker's compensation benefits protected by the right to due process and that the agency hearing conducted prior to the suspension of her benefits afforded her procedural safeguards adequate to satisfy the requisites of constitutional due process[.]" Id. (internal citation omitted). 
Vidal was also protected by procedural safeguards. 
In
 
the Disability Compensation Division's (DCD) January 26, 2009
 decision, it notes that a hearing was held on December 17, 2008,
 in order to determine whether Vidal's workers' compensation claim
 should be suspended pursuant to the Director's May 19, 2005
 order. Prior to this hearing, Vidal submitted an "opening
 statement" and "introduction of evidence" wherein he supplied the
 DCD with multiple documents, including a personal affidavit. The
 DCD's January 26, 2009 decision notes that it considered Vidal's
 arguments regarding a 2002 medical examination performed by a Dr.
 Tan, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, and that DOT's right
 to have Vidal submit to an IME was satisfied. Vidal presents no

further argument to support his claim that he was denied due
 
process, and we do not find any evidence of this alleged denial. 
Based on the foregoing, the May 2, 2012 Decision and
 
Order and the December 27, 2013 Disposition Order entered by the
 Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board in Case No. AB 2009­036 are affirmed.
