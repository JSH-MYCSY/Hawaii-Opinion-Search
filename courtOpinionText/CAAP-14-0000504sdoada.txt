IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JERRY HALVORSEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KA'Q DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3P8110000164)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jerry Halvorsen1
 appeals from the
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order, which was filed on
 
January 31, 2014 in the District Court of the Third Circuit, Ka 'u 
Division ("District Court").2 After a bench trial, the District
 
Court convicted Halvorsen of one count of Criminal Property
 Damage in the Fourth Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") ยง 708-823.
3 On appeal, Halvorsen argues that
 
1/
 Halvorsen is spelled "Halvorson" in various documents, including
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order. At trial, however, he testified
that his name is spelled "Halvorsen." 
2/
 The Honorable Andrew P. Wilson presided.
 
3/
 HRS ยง 708-823(1) (Supp. 2010) provides, in relevant part: "A
person commits the offense of criminal property damage in the fourth degree if
by means other than fire, the person intentionally or knowingly damages the
property of another without the other's consent." 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i adduced insufficient evidence 
that he perpetrated the offense. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Halvorsen's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, see
 
State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 576, 827 P.2d 648, 651 (1992),
 there was substantial evidence that Halvorsen committed Criminal
 Property Damage in the Fourth Degree. At trial, Pamela Miller, a
 security guard at Ocean View Town Center ("Ocean View"),
 testified that early in the morning on June 5, 2011, she saw
 Halvorsen, who she had seen before at Ocean View, and who she
 knew as "the cement pump man," defacing a business sign with
 spray paint. Miller testified that she called out to Halvorsen,
 asked him what he was doing, and approached him in her vehicle
 when he did not stop. According to Miller, she was approximately
 five feet away from Halversen and close enough to identify him. 
Halvorsen told Miller to "mind [her] own business" and continued
 painting the sign. When he was finished, he got onto his white
 moped and drove away.
4 The business owner testified that she did
 
not give Halvorsen permission to spray-paint the sign. 
Based largely on its finding that Miller was more 
credible than Halvorsen and his girlfriend, the District Court concluded that Halvorsen perpetrated the offense, thereby implying that it disbelieved Halvorsen's alibi. This court declines to pass upon the district court's credibility determinations. In re Doe, 107 Hawai
'i 12, 19, 108 P.3d 966, 973 
(2005) ("The appellate courts will give due deference to the right of the trier of fact 'to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced.'" (quoting State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai
'i 429, 432, 886 
P.2d 766, 769 (App. 1994))). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed on January 31, 2014 in the
 
4/
 Halvorsen admits that his friend and caretaker, Judith Bond, owned
one red and one white scooter and that he had access to those scooters.
