BRYAN ARTHUR, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
MARIE CHANTAL CARPENTIER, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DA NO. 13-1-0808)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Respondent-Appellant Marie Chantal Carpentier, pro se,
 
appeals from an Order for Protection, filed on February 7, 2014,
 
in the Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family Court").1/
  
After a hearing, the Family Court issued the Order for
 Protection, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 586-5.5 (2006),

 
in favor of Petitioner-Appellee Bryan Arthur and against
 Carpentier. 
On appeal, Carpentier appears to argue that the Family
 
Court erroneously issued the Order for Protection based on
 insufficient evidence and on the basis that she was not given an
 adequate amount of time to prepare a defense. Despite being
 afforded an opportunity to file a late transcript request, no
 transcript requests were filed, and Carpentier has failed to
 include a transcript of the February 7, 2014 hearing on Arthur's
 Petition for an Order for Protection in the record on appeal. 
Without the transcript, this court has an inadequate basis upon
 
1/

which to review Carpentier's points of error. See Hawai 'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 10(b)(1)(A); State v. Hoang, 93 
Hawai'i 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) ("[This court] will not 
presume error from a silent record."); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("'The 
burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript.'" (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order for
 
Protection, filed on February 7, 2014, in the Family Court of the
 Third Circuit, is affirmed.
