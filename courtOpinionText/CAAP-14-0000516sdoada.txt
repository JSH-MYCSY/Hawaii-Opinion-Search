sustain the revocation of Pearson's driver's license on the
 
grounds that he was denied his right to an expeditious hearing.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Pearson's point of error as follows:
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-38(a) (Supp. 2013)
 
provides: (1) a schedule for the commencement of an ADLRO
 hearing, in this case, within twenty-five days from the date the
 notice of administrative revocation was issued; and (2) that "the 
director may continue the hearing only as provided in subsection
 (j)." HRS ยง 291E-38(j) (Supp. 2013) provides (emphasis added):
 
(j) For good cause shown, the director may grant a
continuance either of the commencement of the hearing or of
a hearing that has already commenced. If a continuance is
 granted at the request of the director, the director shall
extend the validity of the temporary permit, unless
otherwise prohibited, for a period not to exceed the period
of the continuance. If a continuance is granted at the
request of the respondent, the director shall not extend the
validity of the temporary permit. For purposes of this
section, a continuance means a delay in the commencement of
the hearing or an interruption of a hearing that has
commenced, other than for recesses during the day or at the
end of the day or week. The absence from the hearing of a
law enforcement officer or other person, upon whom personal
service of a subpoena has been made as set forth in
subsection (g), constitutes good cause for a continuance.
 
Here, two continuances were granted "due to the absence
 
from the hearing of a law enforcement officer or other person,
 
upon whom personal service of a subpoena has been made" and thus
 for "good cause" as defined in the statute.
2 We decline to
 
conclude that the total period of four-and-one-half months
 between the notice and the hearing was per se overly burdensome,

 We also note that Pearson does not cite to anything in the record
showing that he objected to the length of the continuances granted by the
hearing officer or that he requested earlier hearing dates.

violated Pearson's right to an expeditious hearing, and thus
 
mandated dismissal. Therefore, we conclude that the ADLRO
 hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in granting the
 continuances, and thus the District Court did not err in
 affirming the administrative revocation.
 
For these reasons, the District Court's February 11,
 
2014 Judgment on Appeal is affirmed.
