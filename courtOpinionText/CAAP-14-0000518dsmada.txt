Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellant/Cross-Appellee Phoebe P. Lopes 
and the cross-appeals by numerous cross-appellants from the Honorable Jeannette Castagnetti's January 16, 2014 order granting Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee/Cross-Appellee Kualoa Ranch, Inc.'s (Appellee Kualoa Ranch), motion for summary judgment as to its January 14, 2013 first amended complaint to quiet title (the January 16, 2014 summary judgment order), because the circuit court has not yet reduced the January 16, 2014 summary judgment order to a separate and appealable final judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013) and Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) require for an appeal from a civil circuit court case under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). When interpreting 
the requirements for a judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58 approximately twenty years ago, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.

Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Consequently, "[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a 
judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 
869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The January 16, 2014 summary judgment order does not 
expressly resolve all of the parties' claims (such as some of the defendants' counterclaims and cross-claims). Nevertheless, even assuming, arguendo, the January 16, 2014 summary judgment order does resolve all of the parties' claims, the January 16, 2014 summary judgment order is not a judgment, but, instead, it is an order, and "an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle, 119 Hawai
'i at 254, 195 P.3d at 
1186. On March 10, 2014, the circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000518, which does not contain a separate and appealable final judgment that resolves all claims. Absent a separate and appealable final judgment that resolves all of the parties' claims in this case, the appeal and cross-appeals in appellate court case number CAAP­14-0000518 are premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the January 16, 2014 summary judgment order. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000518 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction,
 and all pending motions are dismissed as moot.
