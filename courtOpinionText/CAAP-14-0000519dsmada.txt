LEON C. HAMILTON, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
COLLEEN M. HAMILTON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 13-1-0070K)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Colleen M.
 
Hamilton's (Appellant Colleen Hamilton) appeal from the Honorable
 Aley K. Auna, Jr.'s, interlocutory February 4, 2014 "Order After
 Hearing" (the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order) because the
 family court has
 
•
	 neither decided part (1) of this divorce case by
dissolving Appellant Colleen Hamilton's marriage
with Plaintiff-Appellee Leon Charles Hamilton
(Appellee Leon Hamilton),
 
•	 nor fully decided all of part (4) of this divorce
case by dividing and distributing all of the
couple's property and debts,

as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006) requires under
 
the holding in Eaton v. Eaton:
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
 (4) division and distribution of property and debts. Black
 
v. Black, 6 Haw. App. [493], 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In
 Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided. Although we recommend that,
except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we
conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is
final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3),
and (4) remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.

 128 Hawai
'i 1, 18, 282 P.3d 543, 560 (2012) (citing and quoting 
Eaton); Kakinami v. Kakinami, 125 Hawai 'i 308, 313, 260 P.3d 
1126, 1131 (2011) (citing and quoting Eaton). In so holding, the
 Eaton court was following the Supreme Court of Hawaii's earlier

application of the collateral order doctrine  to the
1
 The Supreme Court of Hawai' i "ha[s], in rare situations,
considered an interlocutory order so effectively ‘final’ that [it] ha[s]
exercised appellate jurisdiction over an appeal that is neither a finaljudgment nor has been allowed by the circuit court under HRS § 641-1(b)."Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai' i 319, 321, 966 P.2d 631,
633 (1998). 
Appellate jurisdiction in these cases is exercised under the
collateral order doctrine. These interlocutory appeals are
limited to orders falling in that small class which finally
determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to,
rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied
review and too independent of the cause itself to require
that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole
case is adjudicated.

appealability of orders, judgments and decrees in divorce cases 
in holding that a divorce "decree . . . was final and appealable with respect to the termination of the marriage and the division of the real property, although the questions of custody and support of minor children were left for future determination." Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 523, 559 P.2d 744, 747 (1977) ("The rationale of the collateral order doctrine is clearly applicable."). 
In the instant case, the family court has not yet
 
decided part (1) of this divorce case, i.e., dissolution of the
 marriage. Through the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order, the
 family court (a) ordered Appellant Colleen Hamilton to pay for
 half of an appraisal fee for a particular real property that the
 married couple owns, (b) ordered Appellant Colleen Hamilton to
 grant an appraiser access to the couple's real property, and
 (c) authorized that Appellee Leon Hamilton "shall" sell the
 couple's real property. The February 4, 2014 interlocutory order
 does not, however, provide a date certain by which appellee Leon
 Hamilton must sell the real property, and, thus, without any
 express deadline for the sale, the actual time period during
 which the sale will take place remains open-ended at the present

appealable under the collateral order doctrine, an appealed order must satisfy
all three of the following requirements: "the order must [1] conclusivelydetermine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue completelyseparate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable onappeal from a final judgment." Id. at 322, 966 P.2d at 634 (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted) (brackets in original). The Supreme Courtof Hawai' i has observed that it "must construe the collateral order doctrine 
narrowly and be parsimonious in its application." Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 
Hawai'i 157, 162, 883 P.2d 78, 83 (1994). Otherwise, "[a]llowing widespread
appeals from collateral orders would frustrate the policy against piecemealappeals embodied in HRS § 641-1." Id.

time. Absent an order, judgment or decree deciding part (1) of 
this divorce case by dissolving the marriage and part (4) of this divorce case by fully dividing and distributing all of the couple's property and debt, the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order is ineligible for appellate review. 
It is noteworthy that, even when a family court had
 
already decided part (1) of a divorce case by having dissolved

 
the marriage, when a party additionally sought appellate review
 of a family court's order that a particular real "property shall
 be sold and the proceeds disbursed[,]" (Eaton, 7 Haw. App. at
 115, 748 P.2d at 803 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks
 omitted)), the Eaton court explained that this particular ruling
 regarding the real property would not become eligible appellate
 review until the family court finished dividing and distributing
 all of the divorced couple's property and debts:
 
In this case, parts (1) and (3) were final and
appealable on August 6, 1986. Part (4), however, is not
final and appealable because the district family court has
not fully and finally divided and distributed all of the
property and debts of the Plaintiff and the Defendant over
which it had jurisdiction.
 
Id. at 119, 748 P.2d at 805. "Sua sponte we conclude that we do
 
not have appellate jurisdiction to review the district family
 court's decisions and orders as to the division and distribution
 of the property and debts over which the district family court
 had jurisdiction." Id. at 118, 748 P.2d at 805.

decided part (1) of the divorce case by dissolving the marriage, the Hawai' i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals does not have appellate jurisdiction over part(4) of a divorce decree where the family court has divided unique propertyequally between the parties without, however, identifying how the division anddistribution would be accomplished); Ferreira v.

In the instant case, it appears that the family court
 
has not yet finished deciding part (4) of this divorce case by
 
fully dividing and distributing all of Appellant Colleen
 Hamilton's and Appellee Leon Hamilton's property and debts. 
Therefore, even if the family court had already decided part (1)of this divorce case by having dissolved the marriage, the
 February 4, 2014 interlocutory order would not yet be eligible
 for appellate review under 
Eaton. 
 

 
The February 4, 2014 interlocutory order is also not
 
appealable under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201
 (1848), i.e., "the Forgay doctrine," which "allows an appellant
 to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property,
 even if all claims of the parties have not been finally
 resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 
704 (1995).3 Although the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has recently

has decided part (1) of the divorce case by dissolving the marriage, theHawai'i Intermediate Court of Appeals does not have appellate jurisdiction
over part (4) of a divorce decree where the family court has not yet dividedand distributed all of the property and debts); Aoki v. Aoki, 105, 403, 414,98 P.3d 274, 285 (App. 2004) (holding, among other things, that, even afterthe family court has decided part (1) of the divorce case by dissolving themarriage, "the division and distribution of property and debts part of thiscase has not been finally decided and[, therefore,] we do not have appellatejurisdiction over that part of this case.").

 Under the Forgay doctrine, appellate courts "have jurisdiction to 
consider appeals from judgments which [1] require immediate execution of acommand that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and [2] thelosing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review hadto wait the final outcome of the litigation." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (citations, internal quotation marks omitted;some brackets omitted, some brackets added). Thus, in an appeal from asummary possession case, where a district court entered a judgment forpossession that did not, however, resolve an outstanding counterclaim in thecase, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i held that "the judgment for possession was
a judgment immediately appealable under the Forgay doctrine." Id. 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the appellant's adversary, the order still provided a specific 
time deadline by which the trial court required the appellants to surrender possession of the real property: 
Here, the October 25, 2012 Confirmation Order meets
the requirements of appealability under the Forgay doctrine.
Although the October 25, 2012 Confirmation Order does not
command the immediate execution of the property to Trustee
Lambert, the order confirms the sale to Trustee Lambert,
directs the commissioner to convey the property to Trustee
Lambert, and orders the Teisinas to surrender the property
within 30 days of the conveyance. The Confirmation Order
effectively terminates the Teisinas’ rights to the property
and they will suffer irreparable injury if appellate review
is postponed until final judgment.
 
Lambert v. Teisina , 131 Hawai 'i 457, 462,319 P.3d 376, 381 (2014) 
(emphases added). 
The instant case is distinguishable from 
Lambert in
 
that the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order does not provide
 
any specific date or deadline by which Appellant Colleen Hamilton
 must surrender possession of the subject real property, but,
 instead, the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order merely
 authorizes Appellee Leon Hamilton to sell the real property at
 some unspecified date in the future. As of February 4, 2014, the
 real property had not yet even been appraised, much less listed
 for sale. Under the open-ended language of the February 4, 2014
 interlocutory order, the actual sale of the real property could
 possibly take place in weeks, months, or even years; no one knows
 for certain. The primary purposes of the February 4, 2014
 interlocutory order appears to have been (a) to require Appellant
 Colleen Hamilton to cooperate in and contribute to the process of
 appraising the couple's real property and (b) to provide Appellee
 Leon Hamilton with the family court's express authority to sell
 the couple's real property at some unspecified time in the
 
-6­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
future. Without more, the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order 
does not appear to be appealable under the Forgay doctrine, and Appellant Colleen Hamilton will have ample opportunity to seek appellate review as soon as the family court decides part (1) and part (4) of this divorce case. 
Finally, the family court did not purport to certify
 
the February 4, 2014 interlocutory order for an interlocutory
 appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013). 
Therefore, absent an order, judgment or decree that decides both
 part (1) of this case by dissolving the couple's marriage and
 part (4) of this divorce case by fully dividing and distributing
 all of the couple's property and debts, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over this appeal, and Appellant Colleen Hamilton's
 appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0000519 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
