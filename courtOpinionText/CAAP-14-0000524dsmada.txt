FELIX DACANAY as Personal Representative of the ESTATE OF ROGER
ROXAS and THE GOLDEN BUDHA CORPORATION, a foreign corporation,
Plaintiffs-Appellants,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 88-0522-02)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiffs-
Appellants Felix Dacanay (Appellant Decanay), as personal
 representative of the Estate of Roger Roxas and The Golden Budha
 Corporation (Appellant Golden Budha Corporation) have asserted
 from the Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto's April 8, 2014 interlocutory
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Order Granting Imelda Marcos as Personal Representative of the 
Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos's Motion to Dismiss Complaint" (the April 8, 2014 interlocutory order) because the circuit court has not yet reduced the April 8, 2014 interlocutory order to an appealable final judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013) and Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) require for an appeal under the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 
119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees, but, those appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has promulgated 
HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." (Emphasis added). Based on this separate document requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i held more than twenty years ago that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. The 
separate judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. When interpreting the requirement for 
an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 
parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis; 
citation omitted). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an 
order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has 
explained that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii 
Corporation, 81 Hawai
'i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) 
(emphases added). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins 
v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339 (footnote omitted; emphasis added). Furthermore, even when a circuit court enters a judgment, "an appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
The April 8, 2014 interlocutory order is not a
 
judgment; it is an interlocutory order. On May 5, 2014, the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
circuit court clerk filed the record on appeal for appellate
 
court case number CAAP-14-0000524, which does not contain a
 separate judgment on the April 8, 2014 interlocutory order. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate
 jurisdiction, and Appellant Decanay and Appellant Golden Budha
 Corporation's appeal is premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000524 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
