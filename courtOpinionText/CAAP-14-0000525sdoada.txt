SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In these consolidated appeals, Plaintiff-Appellant 
State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals from orders granting motions 
filed by Defendants-Appellees Bruce Takahashi (Takahashi), Daniel 
Takashima (Takashima), and Sean McDaniel (McDaniel) (collectively, Defendants) to suppress the results of blood tests used to determine their blood alcohol concentration. 
In the cases underlying the consolidated appeals, the
 
Defendants were each arrested in separate incidents for driving
 under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII). They were taken to
 the Wailuku Police Station, and they elected to take a blood test
 to determine their blood alcohol concentration.
1 In each case,
 
the blood sample was taken by a registered nurse who followed a
 blood draw procedure that included sterilization of the puncture
 area and use of a sterile needle. During the blood draw, each
 Defendant was seated in a chair in the processing room of the
 Wailuku Police Station and was handcuffed to the wall. 
Takahashi's arm and Takashima's arm were placed on a cardboard
 lid covering a waste basket during their respective blood draws. 
In each case, the District Court of the Second Circuit
 
2
(District Court)  suppressed the results of the Defendant's blood
test based on its conclusions that: (1) the blood draw in each case "did not satisfy the 'reasonableness' requirement in [State v.] Entrekin[, 98 Hawai
'i 221, 233, 47 P.3d 336, 348 (2002)] that 
the blood draw be done in a hospital-like environment"; and (2) the State failed to comply with the requirements imposed by Hawai
'i's implied consent law for the collection of the blood 
sample from the Defendant. The District Court filed its "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law [and] Order Granting Motion to Suppress Evidence" (Suppression Order) in Takahashi's

case (2DTA-13-00002) on February 12, 2014, in Takashima's case
 
(2DTA-13-00331) on February 12, 2014, and in McDaniel's case
 (2DTA-13-00469) on February 18, 2014.
 
I.
 
On appeal, the State argues that the District Court 
erred in granting the Defendants' motions to suppress evidence and challenges the "conclusions of law" entered by the District Court in each case that: (1) the blood draw "did not satisfy the 'reasonableness' requirement in Entrekin that the blood draw be done in a hospital-like environment"; and (2) the State failed to comply with the requirements imposed by Hawai
'i's implied consent 
law for the collection of the blood sample from the Defendant. 
In State v. Barton, No. CAAP-14-0000553, 2015 WL 
6457126 (Hawai 'i App. Oct. 26, 2015), we addressed the State's 
challenge to the same conclusions of law entered by the District Court under very similar factual circumstances. We adopt and apply our analysis in Barton in resolving the State's challenge to the District Court's conclusions of law in the instant consolidated appeals. 
II.
 
As in Barton, the District Court appears to have relied
 
on an erroneous interpretation of Entrekin to rule, as a matter
 of law, that a blood draw is unreasonable if it is not "done in
 hospital-like environment." In Barton, we explained that "while
 the blood draw in Entrekin occurred in a hospital, the Entrekin
 court did not make a hospital-like environment a prerequisite to
 a finding of reasonableness and specifically declined to decide
 the issue." Barton, 2015 WL 6457126, at *1.
3 We agree with
 
other courts that have rejected a per se rule that would render a
 blood draw automatically unreasonable if it does not take place
 
3The Entrekin court simply noted that as in Schmerber v.
California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), it was not presented with the
situation where a blood draw was "'made by other than medicalpersonnel or in other than a medical environment.'" Entrekin, 98 
Hawai
'i at 233 n.15, 47 P.3d at 348 n.15 (brackets omitted)
(quoting Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772).

in a hospital-like environment. State v. Daggett, 640 N.W.2d
 
546, 550 (Wis. Ct. App. 2001) ("Although Schmerber [v.
 
California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966)] urged caution, it did not
 categorically reject the possibility that a blood draw could take
 place in a non-medical setting."); State v. Johnston, 336 S.W.3d
 649, 662 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App. 2011) ("Though a medical
 environment may be ideal, it does not mean that other settings
 are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.").
 
Similar to Barton, the District Court's findings were
 
insufficient in that they failed to adequately identify or
 explain in what respects the environment in which the Defendants'
 blood was drawn would support the District Court's conclusion
 that the blood draws were unreasonable. In other words, the
 District Court's findings did not explain how the environment of
 the blood draw affected the blood draw's reasonableness. See
 
Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 771-72 (indicating that a blood draw in a
 non-medical environment may be unreasonable if it "invite[s] an
 unjustified element of personal risk of infection and pain"). 
Such additional findings are necessary for this court to conduct
 a meaningful review of the District Court's decisions. We
 therefore remand the cases to the District Court to permit it to
 make additional findings that explain how the environment of the
 blood draw affected the blood draw's reasonableness and to take
 additional evidence, as necessary, to determine in each case
 whether, based on all the facts of the case, the blood draw met
 the constitutional reasonableness standard. See Barton, 2015 WL
 
6457126, at *1.
 
In each of the underlying cases, the District Court 
entered a conclusion of law that the State failed to comply with the requirements imposed by Hawai
'i's implied consent law for the 
collection of the blood sample from the Defendant. For the reasons set forth in Barton, we conclude that this conclusion of law was wrong. See id. at *2.

4In Barton, we noted that the District Court had concluded
that the person conducting the blood draw was qualified to draw

III.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Suppression Order
 
entered in each of the underlying cases, and we remand the cases
 
for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition
 Order.

, 2015 WL 6457126, at *2. Although the District
Court did not specifically enter this same conclusion in theinstant cases, the Defendants do not dispute that the registerednurses who conducted their blood draws were qualified to drawblood pursuant to these provisions. The circumstances that 
Barton relied upon in its analysis are also present in the
instant cases.
