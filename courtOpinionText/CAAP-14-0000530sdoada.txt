IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ERNEST LUTHER ROBERTS, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 10-1-0089; CR. NO. 07-1-1245)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Earnest Luther Roberts was
 
convicted by a jury of Electronic Enticement of a Child in the
 
First Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
 § 707-756 (Supp. 2007). Roberts appealed, contending that there
 was insufficient evidence to convict him, that the trial court
 lacked jurisdiction, and that the trial court abused its
 discretion in sentencing him to a 10-year open prison term (the
 "direct appeal"). This court affirmed. State v. Roberts, No.
 
28993, 2010 WL 76359 (Haw. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2010).
 
Thereafter, Roberts filed a Petition to Vacate, Set 
Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody ("Petition") pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure ("HRPP") in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1/ The Circuit Court denied the Petition 
without a hearing. Roberts now appeals from that denial. 
In this appeal, Roberts reasserts several of the
 
arguments made in the Petition. Specifically, Roberts asserts
 that he was denied effective assistance of counsel on his direct
 appeal because appellate counsel failed to: (1) file a reply

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
brief; (2) state or argue that the Respondent-Appellee State of 
Hawai'i committed specific constitutional violations, including 
Roberts' contention that HRS § 707-756 was void for vagueness as applied; and (3) follow Roberts' directions or provide him with an opportunity to review the opening brief before counsel filed it. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance, the issues they raise, and the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Roberts' points of
 error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) Roberts asserts that his appellate counsel was
 
ineffective because counsel failed to file a reply brief on
 direct appeal. A reply brief, however, is not compulsory. Haw.
 R. App. P. 28(d). ("[T]he appellant may file a reply brief."
 (emphasis added)). Roberts contends that counsel's decision to
 not file a reply brief amounted to a failure to "correct specific
 errors of fact still in dispute." We disagree.
 
Roberts fails to clearly identify the "errors of fact" 
to which he refers. Rather, Roberts points us to Exhibits A-D
2/ 
but does not explain what the aforementioned errors are, whether they were addressed in the opening or answering briefs, or how the failure to address them in a reply brief "resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai
'i 495, 510, 
229 P.3d 313, 328 (2010) (quoting State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 349, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980)). Because Roberts presents no colorable argument on this point, it is without merit. Kakinami

 Exhibit A appears to be an introductory letter from Roberts to his
appellate counsel, dated March 3, 2009, well before the opening brief was
filed in the direct appeal. The exhibit appears to consist of five pages,
four of which, however, are missing from the record on appeal. As such, it is
difficult to discern what Roberts intends to argue by his reference to Exhibit
A. Exhibits B-D each post-date this court's decision in the underlying
appeal, and reflect questions posed by Roberts with regard to counsel's
adopted appellate strategy. That counsel did not share Roberts' opinion about
the strength of various arguments is not necessarily reflective of counsel's
ineffectiveness. As the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, "[t]his process of
'winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on' those more likely
to prevail, far from being evidence of incompetence, is the hallmark of
effective appellate advocacy." Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 536 (1986)
(quoting Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751–52 (1983)).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai 'i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 
(2012) ("[The] court may 'disregard a particular contention if 
the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position[.]'" (quoting In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai
'i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007))). 
(2) Roberts next asserts that appellate counsel was
 
ineffective for failing to "federalize" his arguments by "stating
 the specific Constitutional Amendment Violated[.]" Based on his
 supporting arguments, we understand Roberts to contend that: (a)
 there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and
 (b) HRS § 707-756 was too broadly applied to him and, as such,
 was unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case. 
(a) In our review of Roberts' direct appeal, this court
 
affirmed the trial court's application of HRS § 707-756 and
 concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the
 jury's finding that the "meeting place" in Roberts' case was the
 Humane Society in general, and that Roberts "had intended to or
 knew he had traveled to the agreed upon meeting place." Roberts,
 
2010 WL 76359 at *1.  As such, Roberts' claims on this point have
 been previously ruled upon, and are not properly the subject of a
 HRPP Rule 40 Petition. See Haw. R. App. P. 40(a)(3) ("Rule 40
 
proceedings shall not be available and relief thereunder shall
 not be granted where the issues sought to be raised have been
 previously ruled upon or were waived.").
 
(b) HRS § 707-756 is not unconstitutionally overbroad 
or vague on its face. Indeed, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has 
ruled on that question. State v. Alangcas, 134 Hawai 'i 515, 345 
P.3d 181 (2015) (holding that enticement statute was not generally or facially overbroad and was not rendered impermissibly vague by its reference to state's sex offender registration law that defined "covered offenses" in a catch-all clause). Moreover, Roberts concedes that the portion of HRS § 707-756 that proscribes "travel[] to the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon meeting time" does not appear to be vague. Instead, Roberts contends that the statute was made vague by its application to him when he did not go directly to the Humane Society bench (which he contends was to be the "meeting 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
place"), but instead parked his vehicle across the street from
 
where he could observe the bench.
 
That issue, although not couched in terms of "void for 
vagueness" or "overbreadth," was addressed in our earlier decision on the direct appeal. There, we concluded that the fact "[t]hat [Roberts] did not go to the benches fronting the Humane Society building is of little consequence; the record clearly shows that he had agreed to meet the 'minor' at the Humane Society in general." Roberts, 2010 WL 76359 at *1. Roberts 
advances no other arguments on this point, so it is, therefore, without merit. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 144 n.16, 276 P.3d at 
713 n.16 (citations omitted). 
(3) Finally, Roberts asserts that appellate counsel's
 
failure to raise certain arguments, despite Roberts' repeated
 requests and instruction to do so, demonstrates that counsel was
 ineffective. Roberts cites Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470
 (2000) in support of his claim, but that case addressed the
 question of whether counsel was ineffective for failing to file a
 notice of appeal. Id. at 470. Here, however, a notice of appeal
 
was clearly filed. 
Indeed, appellate counsel's alleged "errors" are more 
closely akin to strategic decisions ordinarily left to counsel's discretion. See, e.g., State v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawai
'i 206, 
237–38, 297 P.3d 1062, 1093–94 (2013) (citing Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)). "An informed tactical decision [by counsel] will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." Briones, 74 Haw. at 463, 848 P.2d 966, 977 
(citing State v. McNulty, 60 Haw. 259, 270, 588 P.2d 438, 446 (1978)). Roberts has failed to show that these purported errors or omissions "reflect[] counsel's lack of skill, judgment or diligence[.]" Metcalfe, 129 Hawai
'i at 222–23, 297 P.3d at 
1078–79 (quoting State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai 'i 504, 513–14, 78 
P.3d 317, 326–27 (2003)). Most importantly, Roberts has not shown that these errors or omissions "resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." Hussein, 122 Hawai
'i at 510, 229 P.3d at 328 (quoting 
Antone, 62 Haw. at 349, 615 P.2d at 104). As such, Roberts 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
presents no colorable claim that warrants relief under HRPP Rule
 
40, and the Circuit Court was not wrong to deny the Petition
 without a hearing. See Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(f) & (g)(2). 
Therefore, the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 
and Order Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief Without a
 Hearing, filed on January 23, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit, is affirmed.
