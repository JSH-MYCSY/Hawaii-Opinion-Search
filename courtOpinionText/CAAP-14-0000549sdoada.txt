IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ROBIN M. LEE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
BANK OF HAWAII, it's current President
& CEO PETER HO, it's LOSS PREVENTION,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0189 VLC)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
In this interlocutory appeal, Plaintiff-Appellant Robin
 
M. Lee, pro se ("Lee"), appeals from the denial of (1) the
 
Petition Set Forth to Remove Prefiling Order of Review, filed on
 March 11, 2014 ("Petition"); and (2) the Motion for an In Forma
 Pauperis Order and Assistance with Process Service and Court
 Appt. If Applicable, filed on March 3, 2014 ("Motion for IFP"),
 
1/ 
by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court") .  
On appeal, Lee does not explicitly allege any points of error;
 nevertheless, we construe his arguments as contending that the
 Circuit Court erred in denying the Petition and the Motion for
 IFP because he cannot afford the filing fee.
 
This court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the 
purported denial of the Petition because it lacks the signature of any judge, and is not a separate, appealable final judgment, as required by Hawaii Revised Statutes section 641-1(a) (Supp. 2013) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
1/
 The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall and Edwin C. Nacino presided.
Judge Crandall appears to have presided over the Motion for IFP, and Judge
Nacino appears to have presided over the March 11, 2014 Petition.

Moreover, no exception to the final judgment requirement applies 
to the purported denial of the Petition. See Siangco v. 
Kasadate, 77 Hawai 'i 157, 162, 883 P.2d 78, 83 (1994) (the 
collateral order doctrine must be construed narrowly and applied parsimoniously); Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (allowing for an immediate appeal from a judgment for execution upon property); Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 641-1(b) (allowing the appeal from an interlocutory order "whenever the circuit court may think [it] advisable"). 
Conversely, we appear to have appellate jurisdiction
 
over Lee's challenge to the denial of the Motion for IFP because
 the denial is accompanied by what appears to be handwritten
 initials of Judge Virginia L. Crandall, and because "[t]he denial
 . . . of a motion to proceed in forma pauperis is an appealable
 order [under the collateral order doctrine]." Roberts v. United
 
States District Court for the Northern District of California,
 339 U.S. 844, 845 (1950). Nevertheless, Lee has issued against
 him by the Circuit Court an outstanding order deeming him a
 "vexatious litigant" and requiring that he "first obtain[] leave
 of the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is
 proposed to be filed." Because the record contains no evidence
 of Lee having obtained leave to file his complaint or the related
 Motion for IFP, the Circuit Court did not err in denying the
 motion. 
Therefore, we affirm the denial of the March 3, 2014
 
Motion for IFP, and dismiss Lee's challenge of the denial of the
 March 11, 2014 Petition Set Forth to Remove Prefiling Order of
 Review for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
