IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. JOSEPH VAIMILI,
Defendant-Appellee, and INTERNATIONAL FIDELITY INSURANCE COMPANY,
Real Party in Interest-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0410)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Real Party in Interest-Appellant International Fidelity
 
Insurance Company (International) appeals from the "Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [International's]
 Renewed Motion to Set Aside [Judgment] or for Clarification of
 Judgment" entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (Circuit Court) on February 18, 2014.
1 This matter arises out of
 
the forfeiture of the $250,000 bail bond posted by Freedom Bail
 Bond (Freedom), as agent for International, on behalf of criminal
 defendant Joseph Vaimili (Vaimili). 
International argues that the Circuit Court (1) erred
 
when it concluded that Freedom was a general agent of
 International because that conclusion is not supported by the
 Power of Attorney given to Freedom by International; (2) erred
 when it concluded that notice to International was unnecessary
 because, under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014),
 International and not Freedom was the "surety"; (3) erred when it
 enforced the judgment against International because it was

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deprived of notice and an opportunity to be heard under HRS
 
§ 804-51; and (4) erred when it enforced the judgment against
 International as a "surety or sureties on the bond" because
 International's name does not appear on the bond.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the applicable authority, and the
 record, we resolve International's points on appeal as follows
 and affirm.
 
On July 23, 2009, Ida Peppers, on behalf of Freedom,
 
posted a Bail Bond (Bail Bond) in the amount of $250,000,
 securing Vaimili's release in Criminal No. 09-1-0410. Attached
 to the Bail Bond was a "Power of Attorney" (POA) that was
 executed by Francis Mitterhoff, Chairman of the Board, and Norman
 Konvits, Secretary, of International, purporting to bind it as
 surety for the appearance bond in criminal case number 09-1-0410
 for Vaimili in the amount of $250,000.
2 Eventually, Vaimili
 
failed to appear at trial and on June 28, 2010, the Circuit Court
 entered its Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond
 (Forfeiture Judgment). The State of Hawai
'i (State) served 
Freedom Bail Bonds through Ida Peppers with the Forfeiture
 Judgment on June 28, 2010 by certified mail, return receipt

requested. The return receipt indicates delivery was made and
 
acknowledged on July 6, 2010.3
 
Freedom moved to set aside the Forfeiture Judgment on
 
July 27, 2010. The Circuit Court denied Freedom's motion on
 August 16, 2010. Freedom appealed from the Circuit Court's
 decision on September 16, 2010; this appeal was assigned number
 CAAP-10-0000017. Freedom's appeal was dismissed for lack of
 jurisdiction on December 30, 2010.
 
Meanwhile, on September 21, 2010, Paul Kaneshiro, Court
 
Administrative Services Officer, First Circuit Court, sent by
 certified mail, return receipt requested, a letter notifying
 International of the bail bond forfeiture in criminal number
 09-1-0410, State of Hawaii v. Joseph Vaimili, Issuing General
 Agent Freedom Bail Bond, Policy number IS250K-5395
 (Notification). Attached to the Notification were copies of (1)
 the Forfeiture Judgment, naming International as the surety
 "through its agent and attorney in fact, Ida Peppers," (2) the
 August 16, 2010 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order
 Denying [Freedom's] Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Order of
 Forfeiture of Bail Bond[,]" and (3) the Bail Bond. International
 acknowledged it received this Notification on September 24, 2010
 in the Declaration of James D. Portman, Authorized Representative
 of International, in which Portman attested that, among other
 things, he was the custodian of records for International. 
International did not file a motion to set aside the forfeiture
 until January 27, 2012, over sixteen months after it received the
 Notification.
 
In Vaimili I, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that, 
"once a bond is forfeited pursuant to HRS § 804-51, a surety has thirty days from the time it receives notice of forfeiture to set aside the forfeiture judgment[,]" 131 Hawai
'i at 15, 313 P.3d at 
704, and reaffirmed its explanation in State v. Ranger Ins. Co.,

 Although no written motion for forfeiture or a transcript of the
proceedings when the Circuit Court ordered the Bail Bond forfeited is part of
the record on appeal, the Hawai' i Supreme Court in State v. Vaimili, 131 
Hawai'i 9, 19, 313 P.3d 698, 708 (2013) (Vaimili I), noted that the Forfeiture
Judgment in this case was entered pursuant to HRS § 804-51 and sustained theCircuit Court's denial of Freedom's motions for relief from the Forfeiture Judgment.

83 Hawai 'i 118, 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 288, 294 n.5 (1996), that "'HRS 
§ 804-51 permits the filing neither of a second motion seeking to 
show "good cause why execution should not issue" nor any motion after the closing of the thirty-day window.'" Id.
 at 17, 313 
P.3d at 706. 
In 
State v. Nelson, CAAP-12-0001040 (Haw. App. 
Sept. 29, 2016), this court held that the term "surety" as used in HRS § 804-51, refers to the bail bondspersons/bail agents, i.e., the person signing the bond--in this case Ida Peppers--and that under the plain language of HRS § 804-51, whenever a court forfeits the bond, judgment must be immediately entered and notice of the forfeiture must be given to the "surety or sureties on the bond." As in Nelson
, notice of the entry of Forfeiture 
Judgment was properly made on Ida Peppers/Freedom, triggering the thirty-day window in which to seek relief from the forfeiture. International's January 27, 2012 motion to set aside the Forfeiture Judgment was well outside the thirty-day window and thus the Circuit Court correctly denied International's motion. 
Therefore, the February 18, 2014 "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying International Fidelity Insurance Company's Renewed Motion to Set Aside [Judgment] or for Clarification of Judgment" entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
