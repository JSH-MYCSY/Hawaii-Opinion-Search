Alternative (6) for Stay and (7) for Bond Pending Appeal, Filed
 
February 6, 2014, filed on March 21, 2014.
 
The Bouleys did not appeal from the Circuit Court's 
March 21, 2012 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order [(FOF/COL and Order)] Granting DB's Motion for Summary Judgment 
and Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, which ordered 
foreclosure of the subject property and a judicial sale and appointed a commissioner to conduct a foreclosure auction of the subject property, and Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 54(b) certified judgment on the FOF/COL and Order as to all claims set forth in DB's complaint. Rather, on this appeal, the Bouleys contend, inter alia, that the Circuit Court erred in approving and entering the parties' Stipulated Confirmation Order. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve the Bouleys' appeal as follows: 
We must first address DB's argument that the Bouleys' 
appeal is moot because no relief can be granted, as the Bouleys failed to obtain a stay, and the subject property has been sold to a good faith third-party purchaser. See, e.g., Doe v. Doe, 
120 Hawai
'i 149, 164-65, 202 P.3d 610, 625-26 (App. 2009) 
(stating that mootness is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction). 
"[W]hen 'an event occurs which renders it impossible
 
for an appellate court, if it should decide the case in favor of
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the appellant, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the 
court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal.'" City Bank v. Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. 130, 134, 
748 P.2d 812, 815 (1988) (brackets omitted) (quoting Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895)). The sale of a subject property to a good faith purchaser during the pendency of an appeal renders a challenge to the confirmation of a foreclosure sale moot as it prevents the appellate court from granting any effective relief. Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai
'i 307, 314-15, 
141 P.3d 480, 487-88 (2006); see also Saje Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 814 ("[T]he right of a good faith purchaser 'to receive property acquired at a judicial sale cannot be affected by the reversal of an order ratifying the sale where a supersedeas bond has not been filed.'") (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted). "[I]t is appellant's burden to seek a stay if post-appeal transactions could render the appeal moot." Sakatani, 111 Hawai
'i at 313, 141 P.3d at 486. 
An "innocent" or good faith purchaser is "one who, by an honest contract or agreement, purchases property or acquires an interest therein, without knowledge, or means of knowledge sufficient to charge him in law with knowledge, of any infirmity in the title of the seller." Ka'u Agribusiness Co. v. Heirs or Assigns of 
Ahulau, 105 Hawai
'i 182, 193, 95 P.3d 613, 624 (2004) (citation 
omitted). 
Here, on January 23, 2014, the subject property was
 
conveyed to DB by the Commissioner's Deed, which was registered
 
in the Land Court under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT)
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1073415 on January 30, 2014. On January 30, 2014, DB conveyed
 
the subject property to Zumirez Drive, LLC (Zumirez) by the
 
Quitclaim Deed, which was registered in the Land Court under TCT
 
1073416. Thereafter, on September 26, 2014, the subject property
was sold from Zumirez to the William C. Johnson and Donna K.
 Johnson [(the Johnsons)] as Trustees of the William C. and Donna
 
K. Johnson Revocable Trust, with title transferring by Warranty
 
Deed. The Bouleys do not challenge or deny that the Johnsons
 were good-faith third-party purchasers of the subject property. 
Accordingly, the Johnsons' right to receive the subject property
 cannot be affected by the reversal of an order ratifying the sale
where a supersedeas bond has not been filed. 
Saje Ventures II , 7
Haw. App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 814. Here, the Bouleys failed to
 post a supersedeas bond in accordance with the Circuit Court's
 setting of the bond amount, and all of the Bouleys' attempts to
 otherwise obtain a stay were denied. Thus, absent any other
 exceptions to the rule, this court cannot grant relief to the
 Bouleys. 
 
  
There are two exceptions to the rule set forth in Saje
 
Ventures II: (1) where the reversal requested is based on
 jurisdictional grounds, or (2) where the purchaser is the
 mortgagee. 7 Haw. App. at 133, 748 P.2d at 814. However,
 neither exception applies here, as the Bouleys do not request
 reversal of the orders based on jurisdictional grounds, and the
 Johnsons were not the mortgagee. 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has also recognized two 
general exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) the capable of 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
repetition, yet evading review exception (CRER); and (2) the 
public interest exception. Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 
119 Hawai 'i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). As to the public 
interest exception, "this court looks to (1) the public or 
private nature of the question presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination for future guidance of public officers, and (3) the likelihood of future recurrence of the question." Id. at 6-7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (citation and brackets 
omitted). Here, the dispute is clearly of a private nature, and the Bouleys, who did not address the issue of mootness in their briefs, do not present this court with any basis to conclude that the circumstances require "an authoritative determination for future guidance of public officers" or that there is a "likelihood of future recurrence of the question." See id. at 6, 
193 P.3d at 844. As to the CRER exception, this case only evades review because the Bouleys failed to post a bond and obtain a stay, rather than due to circumstances out of the Bouleys' control. Sakatani, 111 Hawai
'i at 315, 141 P.3d at 488. Thus, 
"because [the appellants] did not avail themselves of the mechanisms that would have preserved the issue for review, we are compelled to hold that the issue is moot and the exceptions to the mootness doctrine do not apply." 
Id. 
The Bouleys also contend that the Circuit Court abused

 
its discretion by setting too high a bond amount. Under HRCP
 Rule 62(d), "a party taking an appeal from a judgment must file a
 supersedeas bond to stay its enforcement." MDG Supply, Inc. v.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Diversified Inv., Inc., 51 Haw. 375, 382, 463 P.2d 525, 529
 
(1969).
 
The determination of the amount of a supersedeas bond which
will be sufficient to protect the rights of an appellee is
committed to the sound discretion of the circuit court, but
this discretion is not unlimited. Moreover, the bond
requirement may not be used to discourage appeals. 
Midkiff v. de Bisschop, 58 Haw. 546, 550, 574 P.2d 128, 131 
(1978) (per curiam) (citation omitted). A trial court has "the inherent discretion and power to allow for flexibility on the determination of the nature and extent of the security required to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal and can allow an alternative to a supersedeas bond." U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. 
Salvacion, No. 30594, 2011 WL 1574585, at *9 (Haw. App. Apr. 26, 2011) (mem.) citing Shanghai Inv. Co. v. Alteka Co., 92 Hawai
'i 
482, 503-04, 993 P.2d 516, 537-38 (2000), overruled on other grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai
'i 327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001). The 
burden to provide a secure alternative rests on the judgment debtor. Shanghai, 92 Hawai
'i at 503, 993 P.2d at 537. 
Here, the Bouleys requested an alternative to the 
posting of a supersedeas bond, suggesting instead a monthly rental installment payment or "installment bond," plus real property taxes and insurance, in order for them to retain possession pending the outcome of their appeal. The Bouleys' requested alternative, which was essentially a promise to pay monthly amounts in the future, was wholly inadequate to provide a secure alternative; therefore, the Bouleys failed to meet their burden. Shanghai, 92 Hawai
'i at 503, 993 P.2d at 537. 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
For these reasons, the mootness doctrine applies in
 
this case and, therefore, we are without jurisdiction to rule
 
upon the merits of the Bouleys' challenge to, inter alia, the
 Stipulated Confirmation Order. 
In addition, even if the Bouleys' challenge were not
 
moot, it fails on the merits because the Bouleys provide no valid
 grounds for challenging the Confidential Settlement Agreement
 Regarding Sale of Property and the Stipulated Confirmation Order,
 which they failed to timely object to, pursuant to the terms of
 the settlement agreement.
 
Accordingly, we affirm the above-referenced orders and
 
judgments of the Circuit Court.
