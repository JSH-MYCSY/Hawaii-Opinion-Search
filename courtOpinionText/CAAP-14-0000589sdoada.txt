SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Franklin Paul Embernate and
 
Leilani Pauline Embernate (together, Embernates) appeal from the 
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on
 
Plaintiff's Complaint for Ejectment" and "Final Judgment," both
 filed on March 19, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the Third
 Circuit

 (circuit court).
 
On appeal, the Embernates contend the circuit court
 
erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee
 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee Under Pooling
 and Servicing Agreement Dated as of September 1, 2004 Asset-
Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-WHQ1 (

Fargo had standing to conduct the non-judicial foreclosure of the
 
Embernates' property on September 24, 2010.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude the
 Embernates' appeal is without merit.
 
The Embernates argue that the law firm, Leu & Okuda,
 
did not have standing to act on Wells Fargo's behalf when it
 conducted the non-judicial foreclosure sale of their property
 because (1) "the loan servicing rights and attorney-in-fact
 privileges on the Note and Mortgage were transferred from HomEq
 to Ocwen on August 31, 2010" and (2) "the attorney-in-fact
 relationship between [Wells Fargo] and [Barclays Capital Real
 Estate Inc. DBA HomEq Servicing (HomEq)] ended on August 1,
 
2010." In support of their arguments, the Embernates cite to
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-5(a) (Supp. 2011).
2
 
HRS § 667-5 governed non-judicial foreclosures at the
 
time of the sale of the Embernates' property and required that a
 mortgagee "be represented by an attorney who is licensed to
 practice law in the State and is physically located in the State"
 in order to foreclose on a property under the power of sale. The
 record indicates that, contrary to the Embernates' argument on
 appeal, HomEq was not the Wells Fargo's attorney for the non­judicial foreclosure sale, but was merely the servicing agent for
 the Embernates' loan. Attorneys from the Honolulu law firm, Leu
 
2 HRS § 667-5 provides in relevant part:
 
§667–5 Foreclosure under power of sale;
notice; affidavit after sale; deficiency
judgments.  (a) When a power of sale is contained
in a mortgage, and where the mortgagee, the
mortgagee's successor in interest, or any person
authorized by the power to act in the premises,
desires to foreclose under power of sale upon
breach of a condition of the mortgage, the
mortgagee, successor, or person shall be
represented by an attorney who is licensed to
practice law in the State and is physically
located in the State.

& Okuda, were the attorneys of record for Wells Fargo's non­
judicial foreclosure sale. On July 24, 2010, Lester Leu, an
 attorney with Leu & Okuda, signed a notice of the non-judicial
 foreclosure sale of the Embernates' property. On September 28,
 2010, Karyn Doi (Doi), also an attorney with Leu & Okuda, signed
 
an affidavit attesting that all the elements of HRS § 667-5 had
 
been satisfied. Doi's affidavit indicated she was "an attorney
 licensed to practice law in the State of Hawaii."
 
The Embernates do not allege that counsel from Leu & 
Okuda were not licensed to practice law in the State of Hawai
'i 
or that they were not physically located in the State of Hawai 'i. 
In addition, the Embernates do not provide any support for their argument that Wells Fargo's attorney-client relationship with Leu & Okuda terminated once HomEq transferred servicing of the loan to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LCC. Thus, the Embernates fail to provide any support for their argument that Wells Fargo did not satisfy HRS § 667-5. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the March 19, 2014 "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's
 Complaint for Ejectment" and the March 19, 2014 "Final Judgment,"
 both entered in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, are
 affirmed.
