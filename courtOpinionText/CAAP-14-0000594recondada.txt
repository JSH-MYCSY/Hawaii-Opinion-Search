APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
  
(DOCKET NO. AB 2013-250 (2-11-46922))
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
On April 8, 2017, Claimant-Appellant Jay D. Cadiz
 
(Claimant) filed a Motion for Reconsideration and Second Motion
 
to Supplement the Record, along with a memorandum in support and
 
a declaration of counsel (Motion for Reconsideration). Upon
 
consideration of Claimant's Motion for Reconsideration, the
 
papers in support, and the records in Case Nos. CAAP-14-0000594
 and CAAP-16-0000029, it appears that:
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) In the Motion for Reconsideration, Claimant
 
requests reconsideration of the March 31, 2017 Summary
 
Disposition Order, on grounds that are discussed further below. 
Additionally, Claimant requests that this court direct the LIRAB
 to supplement the record with the transcript of Dr. Jannette
 Hope's (Dr. Hope's) testimony or accept the transcript as
 
attached to the Amended Designation (described below) if the
 
LIRAB denies possession of the transcript.
 
(2) We begin with Claimant's request regarding the
 
transcript of Dr. Hope's testimony. On May 29, 2016, Claimant
 filed a motion to consolidate the appeals in Case Nos. CAAP-14­0000594 and CAAP-16-0000029, to supplement the record on appeal
 with exhibits filed with the Labor and Industrial Relations
 Appeal Board (LIRAB), and for leave to file a late request for
 
transcript of Dr. Hope's testimony. 
On December 5, 2016, this court issued an order
 
granting Claimant's request to consolidate the appeals in Case
 
Nos. CAAP-14-0000594 and CAAP-16-0000029, as well as Claimant's
 request to supplement the record with both parties' trial
 exhibits, ordering the LIRAB to supplement the record on appeal
 within ten days of the order. This court also granted Claimant's
 request for leave to file a late Request for Transcript. The
 
court ordered Claimant to file a request for the transcript of
 
Dr. Hope's testimony within two days of the order, and permitted
 Employer-Appellee QSI, Inc., (Employer) and Insurance Carrier­

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellee First Insurance Company of Hawaii, Ltd. to file an
 
amended designation of additional parts of the proceedings to be
 prepared and included in the record on appeal. Notwithstanding
 the granting of leave to do so, Claimant failed to file a Request
 for Transcript.
 
(3) On December 15, 2016, the LIRAB filed a
 
supplemental record on appeal (Docket Nos. 120-124 in CAAP-14­0000594), which did not contain a transcript of Dr. Hope's
 testimony.
 
(4) Later on December 15, 2016, Claimant filed an
 
Amended Designation of Additional Parts of Proceeding for Further
 Supplementation of the Record on Appeal (Amended Designation). 
Claimant requested that the court order the supplementation of
 
the record with the transcript of Dr. Hope's testimony, and
 attached a transcript of Dr. Hope's partial testimony to the
 Amended Designation, arguing that the Request for Transcript was
 unnecessary because counsel believed that the LIRAB was in
 possession of the transcript.
 
(5)
 On March 31, 2017, this court issued its Summary
 
Disposition Order. As stated therein, in CAAP-14-0000594,
 Claimant raised the following three points of error: (1) the
 LIRAB failed to properly apply the presumption of compensability
 under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-85 (2015); (2) the
 
LIRAB erroneously credited Dr. Roger L. Likewise's report; and
 
(3) the LIRAB erroneously excluded Claimant's exhibits, including
 Dr. Hope's declaration and her credentials. As to the first
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
point of error, this court concluded that the LIRAB did not err
 
when it found that Employer presented relevant and credible
 evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a
 conclusion by a reasonable person that Claimant's injuries are
 not connected to his work. 
In the Motion for Reconsideration, Claimant contends
 
that this court's "evaluation of the evidence lacked [C]laimant's
 critical expert testimony and proof of illnesses caused by mold
 exposure, and additionally did not critically weigh the evidence,
 but erroneously determined that the employer had in fact produced
 substantial evidence to rebut [Claimant's] proof." Claimant
 attached a transcript of Dr. Hope's partial testimony, which
 occurred on August 26, 2014 and August 27, 2014,
1
 to the Amended
Designation. We note, however, in LIRAB Case No. AB 2012-099,
 the case underlying CAAP-14-0000594, the evidentiary hearing was
 held on June 14, 2013 and June 17, 2013. Dr. Hope's testimony
 occurred well after the evidentiary hearing for LIRAB Case No. AB
 2012-099. Thus, the LIRAB did not consider Dr. Hope's testimony
 in reaching its determination that Employer presented substantial
 evidence to rebut the presumption of compensability. 
Accordingly, we cannot conclude that this court would have
 considered Dr. Hope's testimony to be helpful in resolving
 Claimant's first point of error.

 It appears that Dr. Hope testified during the evidentiary hearing
for LIRAB Case No. AB 2013-250, the case underlying CAAP-16-0000029.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In CAAP-16-0000029, Claimant contended that the LIRAB 
erred by not remanding the proceedings for a ruling on the 
merits, arguing that the LIRAB failed to comply with the Hawai 'i 
Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), and engaged in improper 
rulemaking when it vacated the Director of the Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations' decision. In conjunction with 
our review of the Motion for Reconsideration, we have considered 
the copy of the subject transcript submitted by counsel with the Amended Designation, and we conclude that this court's further consideration of the transcript would not impact our determination that the LIRAB did not engage in improper rulemaking under HAPA. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Claimant's request to direct
 
the LIRAB to supplement the record with the transcript of Dr.
 Hope's partial testimony is denied as futile. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Claimant's request
 
for reconsideration of this court's March 31, 2017 Summary
 Disposition Order is denied.
