APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(DOCKET NO. AB 2013-250 (2-11-46922))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
This consolidated appeal arises out of an Amended Claim

 
1
for Workers' Compensation Benefits WC-5 (Amended WC-5)  filed by
Claimant-Appellant Jay D. Cadiz (Claimant) with the Director of
 the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Director), in
 which Claimant sought compensation for illnesses and symptoms

 The filing date of the Amended WC-5 is listed as November 28, 2011
in LIRAB Case No. AB 2012-099, and November 21, 2011 in LIRAB Case No. AB
2013-250.

(Employer).  Claimant appeals from two decisions and orders
 
filed by the Labor and Industrial Relations Board (LIRAB). 
Claimant appeals from the (1) March 10, 2014 Decision and Order
 
(LIRAB Case No. AB 2012-099), and (2) December 22, 2015 Decision
 and Order (LIRAB Case No. AB 2013-250). 
In LIRAB Case No. AB 2012-099, the case underlying
 
CAAP-14-0000594, the LIRAB affirmed the decision of the Director
 finding, inter alia, that Claimant did not sustain a work related
 injury on August 31, 2007. In LIRAB Case No. AB 2013-250, the
 case underlying CAAP-16-0000029, the LIRAB vacated the decision
 of the Director denying the November 2011 claim as a new or
 subsequent injury for a November 14, 2011 work injury, but did
 not remand the case to the Director. LIRAB instead concluded
 that the November 2011 claim was not a new claim, rather it was
 an amended claim for the previously claimed injury.
 
In CAAP-14-0000594, Claimant argues that the LIRAB: 
(1) failed to properly apply the presumption of compensability
 under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-85 (2015); (2)
 
erroneously credited Dr. Roger L. Likewise's (Dr. Likewise)
 report; and (3) erroneously excluded Exhibits A-1, B, and FF. 
2
 On September 3, 2010, Claimant filed a claim for workers'
compensation benefits for an August 31, 2007 injury. Claimant identified his
 
injury and illness as: "Headaches, dizziness, [respiratory] problems, memory
problems, vision, skin problems, anxiety." In November 2011, Claimant filed
an Amended WC-5 to "[c]orrect date of discovery of connection of exposure to
illnesses and symptoms" to November 14, 2011. Claimant described his injury
and illnesses as: "Headaches, respiratory illnesses, cognitive impairment,
psychological injury, Chronic rhinitis/sinusitis, Vertigo, Tinnitus,
Palpitations, Sleep Disturbance, Myalgia, GERD, Gastritis, Urinary Frequency,
Dysuria, Malaise, Fatigue."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In CAAP-16-0000029, Claimant argues the LIRAB erred by not
 
remanding the proceedings for a ruling on the merits. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Cadiz's points of error as follows: 
(1) Claimant contends that the LIRAB failed to
 
properly apply the presumption of compensability under HRS § 386­85 and challenges FOFs 54, 55, and 56, in the March 10, 2014
 Decision and Order, which read: 
[FOF 54]: The [LIRAB] finds that through the opinions
of Drs. Cupo, Likewise, and Arora, Employer presented
relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity
sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable person
that Claimant's claimed injuries are not connected to his
work. 
[FOF 55]: The [LIRAB] finds that Employer has
presented substantial evidence that Claimant's claimed
conditions are not related to his employment with Employer. 
[FOF 56]: The [LIRAB] has applied the presumption of
compensability and finds that Employer has presented
substantial evidence to rebut and overcome the presumption.
 
HRS § 386-85 provides in pertinent part, "[i]n any 
proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under 
this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . [t]hat the claim is for a covered work injury[.]" It is well established that the presumption "imposes upon the employer the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion." Van Ness v. Dep't Of 
Educ., 131 Hawai
'i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014) (citing 
Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 53 Haw. 406, 408, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972)). The employer may overcome the presumption "only [with] substantial evidence that [the injury] 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is unrelated to employment." Akamine, 53 Haw. at 408, 495 P.3d 
at 1166. "The term 'substantial evidence' signifies a high 
quantum of evidence which, at the minimum, must be 'relevant and credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify a conclusion by a reasonable [person] that an injury or death is not work connected.'" Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 P.3d at 
477 (quoting Flor v. Holguin, 94 Hawai 'i 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391 
(2000)). "If the employer fails to adduce substantial evidence to the contrary, the presumption mandates that the claimant must prevail." Id. (quoting Akamine, 53 Haw. at 409, 495 P.2d at 
1166). Furthermore, "a reasonable degree of specificity is required in order for medical opinion to rebut the presumption of compensability." Panoke v. Reef Dev. of Haw., Inc., 136 Hawai
'i 
448, 462, 363 P.3d 296, 310 (2015) (quoting Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai
'i 263, 269, 47 P.3d 730, 736 (2002)). 
Pursuant to HRS § 386-3(a) (2015), 
If an employee suffers personal injury either by
accident arising out of and in the course of the employment
or by disease proximately caused by or resulting from the
nature of the employment, the employee's employer or the
special compensation fund shall pay compensation to the
employee or the employee's dependents[.] 
 
In Flor, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that "an 
employee's injury caused by a disease is compensable as an 
'injury by disease,' pursuant to HRS § 386-3, when the disease (1) is caused by conditions that are characteristic of or
 peculiar to the particular trade, occupation, or employment, (2)
 results from the employee's actual exposure to such working
 conditions, and (3) is due to causes in excess of ordinary
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
hazards of employment in general[.]" 94 Hawai 'i at 81, 9 P.3d at 
393 (citations omitted). 
However, the supreme court clarified that the three-
part test articulated in Flor "is not applicable to situations in 
which the disease is alleged to be 'proximately caused by' the employment, rather than alleged to 'result from the nature of the employment.'" Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 559-60, 319 P.3d at 478­
79 (footnote and brackets omitted). A reviewing court should apply the "unitary" or "nexus" test for injuries by disease "proximately caused by" the employment. Id. at 561 & n.13, 319 
P.3d at 480 & n.13. The "unitary" test "requires the finding of a causal connection between the injury and any incidents or conditions of employment." Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co., 77 
Hawai
'i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 1246, 1249 (1994) (citing Chung v. 
Animal Clinic, Inc., 63 Haw. 642, 648, 636 P.2d 721, 725 (1981)). 
In its application of the "unitary" test, the supreme 
court has held that "the slightest aggravation or acceleration of an injury by the employment activity mandates compensation." Van 
Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 562, 319 P.3d at 481 (citation omitted). In 
Van Ness, the claimant "alleged that the aggravation of his asthma resulting from his exposure to vog at [his place of employment] was a compensable injury by disease." Id. at 559, 
319 P.3d at 478. The parties did not dispute that exposure to vog exacerbated and aggravated the claimant's asthma. Id. at 
563, 319 P.3d at 482. The issue was whether the aggravation of claimant's asthma was "proximately caused by or resulting from the nature of the employment." Id. at 559, 319 P.3d at 478. The 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
supreme court determined that the "evidence overwhelmingly
 
demonstrated that [claimant's] exposure to vog at work, combined
 with the surrounding circumstances of his employment and his pre­existing condition, resulted in the exacerbation of his asthma." 
Id. at 564, 319 P.3d at 483. The supreme court concluded that
 claimant's employer had "failed to present substantial evidence
 to overcome the presumption that the aggravation of [claimant's]
 asthma was an injury 'by disease proximately caused by' his
 employment." Id. at 565, 319 P.3d at 484. 
Our analysis begins with the presumption that Claimant 
sustained a compensable injury by disease. HRS § 386-85. The LIRAB determined in FOF 5 that the "symptoms and conditions claimed by Claimant have their bases in basically three diagnoses . . . allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease [(GERD)], and an anxiety disorder." Claimant contends that "[t]his finding is in error because it ignores the illnesses and symptoms diagnosed by treating physicians and experts which are consistent with toxic mold exposure." It is the Employer's burden to produce substantial evidence to rebut the presumption that Claimant's alleged conditions are compensable work-related injuries. Van Ness, 131 Hawai
'i at 558, 319 P.3d at 477. 
Employer contends it "presented substantial, credible, and persuasive medical evidence to show that Claimant's injuries on August 31, 2007 did not arise out of and in the course of his employment." In support of its contention, Employer relies on the reports of Drs. Cupo, Arora, and Likewise. 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Cupo diagnosed Claimant with, inter alia, chronic
 
allergic conjunctivitis and rhinosinusitis with sensitivity to
 
dust mites, chronic GERD, and chronic anxiety. Dr. Cupo opined
 that Claimant's diagnosis was "not caused, aggravated, or
 accelerated by job activities as a meat cutter for Times
 Supermarkets."  Dr. Cupo opined that "the reality  of Claimant's
 
situation is that his multiple symptoms can in no way be
 explained by exposure to mold between August 2004 and December
 2007 at the Kaneohe Store[.]"  Dr. Cupo noted that: 
The reality of the situation is that allergy skin testing
performed on 2/2/08 by Dr. Suga revealed positivity only to
dust mites and negativity to molds. The reality of the
situation is that allergy skin testing repeated on 10/30/09
by Dr. Kuo similarly showed positivity to dust mites and
negativity to molds. The reality of the situation is that
Claimant's multiple symptoms have actually worsened rather
than abated during the greater than three years since
December 2007, when the employee voluntarily terminated his
job and thus has been out of the environment of the Kaneohe
store where he worked as a meat cutter for Times
 Supermarkets. The reality of the situation is that employee
had [GERD] prior to commencing work at the Kaneohe Store in
August 2004 as a meat cutter for Times Supermarkets, as
documented by Dr. Chun in his clinical note of 7/12/04. The
 reality of the situation is that the employee's multiple
symptoms have been precipitated by other identifiable
factors, such as oily foods in the case of [GERD]; stress
from his relationship with his girlfriend in the case of
chronic anxiety; and exposure to dusty home environment in
the case of chronic allergic rhinosinusitis.
 
Dr. Cupo opined that Claimant's "multiple symptoms are
easily and medically plausibly explainable by other medical
 
conditions without the need to concoct exposure to mold at the
 Kaneohe Store between August 2004 and December 2007 while [he]
 was working as a meat cutter for Times Supermarkets as causal." 

 
Dr. Arora also opined that Claimant's conditions were
 
not caused or aggravated by mold exposure. 
Dr. Arora wrote that
 
the "black mold of concern" is "Stachybotrys chararum, which does
 not grow on walls and ceilings." Dr. Arora noted that the "black
 
7
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
mold that grows in lighted areas on walls or ceilings is
 
Ciadosporium, which is a relatively benign mold, causing only
 allergies." Dr. Arora related that Claimant "had no documented
 mold allergies after repeat testing." Additionally, Dr. Arora
 noted that molds can produce toxicity. However, Dr. Arora wrote
 that "toxicity from inhalation of spores in an indoor environment
 has not been documented or established in humans." Dr. Arora
 wrote that "even if we assume that the supermarket building in
 
which [Claimant] worked, had Stachybotrys growing in the attic,
 
and it was the worst building ever described in the United
 States, then one would not anticipate more than 1700 spores of
 
Stachybotrys per cubic meter. That will not be sufficient to
 
cause toxicity from inhalation." Dr. Arora concluded that the
 "issue of mold toxicity in [Claimant] is purely speculative and
 conjectural. [Claimant] apparently was misled by whatever he saw
 on TV and assumed that any black mold anywhere is toxic and
 dangerous." 
Drs. Cupo and Arora also provided alternative
 
explanations for Claimant's allergic rhinitis, GERD, and anxiety. 
Dr. Cupo wrote that Claimant's "multiple symptoms have been
 precipitated by other identifiable factors, such as oily foods in
 the case of [GERD]; stress from his relationship with his
 girlfriend in the case of chronic anxiety; and exposure to dusty
 home environment in the case of chronic allergic rhinosinusitis." 
Dr. Arora determined that Claimant's allergy to dust and mite
 explains his allergic rhinitis. Dr. Arora wrote that Claimant's
 "headaches, dizziness, memory problems, visual problems, chest
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
pains, palpitations, etc. can be more than adequately explained
 
by his chronic anxiety and panic disorder manifesting as
 hyperventilation time to time and causing these symptoms." 
Dr. Arora noted that "orthopedic injury with weight gain[,] use
 of pain medications such as narcotics . . . or emotional issues"
 could aggravate Claimant's GERD. 
Drs. Cupo and Arora examined Claimant and reviewed his 
medical records. In their reports, Drs. Cupo and Arora explained why mold exposure could not have caused or aggravated Claimant's injuries, and did not provide mere generalized medical opinions. See e.g., Nakamura, 98 Hawai
'i at 269, 47 P.3d at 736 
(recognizing that a doctor's report identifying symptoms and behaviors attributable to claimant's pre-existing illness as the source of claimant's "work-related difficulties" constitute "more than a mere 'generalized medical opinion' concerning [claimant's] pre-existing condition."); CF. Korsak v. Haw. Permanente Med. Grp., 94 Hawai
'i 297, 308, 12 P.3d 1238, 1249 (noting that 
doctors' reports provided generalized medical opinions and did not adequately explain whether physical therapy sessions exacerbated claimant's back injury). As such, Dr. Cupo and Arora's reports provide a sufficient degree of specificity to rebut the presumption of compensability that Claimant's injuries were caused, aggravated, or accelerated by mold exposure. Panoke, 136 Hawai
'i at 462, 363 P.3d at 310 (quoting Nakamura, 98 
Hawai'i at 269, 47 P.3d at 736). 
In addition, Dr. Likewise performed an independent
 
psychological examination in which he performed a series of
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
psychological tests including the Minnesota Multiphasic
 
Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), Millon Clinical Multiaxial
 
Inventory-III (MCMI-III), Battery for Health Improvement 2 (BHI­2), and Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology. Dr.
 Likewise noted that Claimant's score on the "Structured Inventory
 
of Malingered Symptomatology far exceeded the cutoff score for
 suspected malingering." The MMPI-2 test indicated that
 Claimant's "FBS (Fake Bad Scale) was sharply elevated . . . in
 the range associated with malingering." Dr. Likewise noted that
 "FBS scores this high are consistent with gross over-reporting of
 somatic and affective symptoms." Dr. Likewise also noted that
 Claimant's Hysteria score "occurs with very high frequency among
 individuals involved in compensation-seeking litigation." The
 MCMI-III test indicated that Claimant's "profile was consistent
 with depressive, schizoid and dependent personality
 traits/features." Dr. Likewise reported that the BHI-2 test
 confirmed Claimant's "significant symptom magnification." 
Dr. Likewise diagnosed Claimant with, inter alia: (1)
 
hypochondriasis, chronic severe; rule out delusional disorder;
 (2) somatization disorder, chronic, severe; (3) generalized
 anxiety disorder, chronic (with panic attack); (4) partner
 relational problem, chronic; and (5) dependent personality
 disorder. Dr. Likewise opined that Claimant developed a
 "comorbid Hypochondriasis" as a result of his "underlying, severe
 Somatization Disorder (i.e., his long-standing preoccupation with
 multiple, medically unexplained somatic complaints[.])" Dr.
 Likewise explained that Hypochondriasis is a "pathological
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
preoccupation with fears of having a specific, serious disease
 
based on a misinterpretation of one or more bodily signs or
 symptoms." Dr. Likewise concluded that Claimant had a panic
 attack on August 31, 2007. Dr. Likewise explained that "[p]anic
 attacks are not psychological disorders, but are rather transient
 anxiety responses." Dr. Likewise opined that Claimant's panic
 attack was "caused by his profoundly pathological preoccupation
 with and misinterpretation of a broad range of somatic symptoms." 
Dr. Likewise stated that Claimant's "Generalized Anxiety
 Disorder, Somatization Disorder and Hypochondriasis are not
 related to or caused by his employment at Times Supermarkets or
 the 8/31/07 injury date." Dr. Likewise explained that Claimant's
 conditions are "entirely pre-existing in nature[,]" and caused by
 a "Dependent/Histrionic personality disorder." Dr. Likewise
 opined that Claimant "did not develop a mental/psychiatric
 disorder related to his employment with Employer and/or the
 8/31/07 incident." 
"Once the trier of fact determines that the employer 
has adduced substantial evidence to overcome the presumption, it must weigh the evidence elicited by the employer against the evidence elicited by the claimant." Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 
Hawai
'i 402, 409, 38 P.3d 570, 577; Panoke, 136 Hawai 'i at 461-62, 
363 P.3 at 309-10. In the instant case, the LIRAB credited the opinion of "Drs. Cupo, Likewise, and Arora over those of Drs. Hope and McCaffrey." Dr. Hope "opined that Claimant's conditions or symptoms were caused by, contributed, or aggravated by his work or working conditions." The LIRAB noted that Dr. Hope "did 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
not examine or treat Claimant[,]" and that there "is no
 
indication as to what medical data she relied on to form an
 opinion regarding causation of Claimant's condition." Dr.
 McCaffrey assessed Claimant's condition as "[a]dult respiratory
 distress syndrome with environmental mold exposure[.]" The LIRAB
 noted that Dr. McCaffrey's reports were "contrary to the medical
 evidence[,]" and also "discussed the work injury in conjunction
 with areas or conditions not claimed by Claimant in the subject
 appeal." On this record, we decline to disturb the LIRAB's
 evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence. 
Claimant also raises the following five sub-arguments
 
regarding the presumption of compensability: (1) Employer failed
 to provide evidence that the Kaneohe Times Supermarket was clean
 and mold free; (2) Employer failed to present evidence to rebut
 the laboratory results of mycotoxin substances; (3) the
 Independent Medical Examination (IME) opinions do not "rule out
 
mycotoxins as the cause of [Claimant's] illnesses and symptoms";
 
(4) independent medical literature confirms Drs. Hope, McCaffrey,
 and Suenaga's opinions; and (5) Dr. Arora's medical articles
 confirms that Claimant's illness was caused by mold exposure. 
These sub-arguments are without merit. 
In his first sub-argument, Claimant argues that
 
Employer failed to provide evidence that the Kaneohe Times
 Supermarket was clean and mold free. However, it is undisputed
 that "mold was present in the area of Claimant's work environment
 during the period in question[,]" and that "Claimant was exposed
 to such mold." Employer did not challenge FOFs 17 and 18, and
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
thus they are binding. State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai 'i 494, 502, 273 
P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012).3 However, the record includes 
substantial evidence of a high degree of specificity, quantity, 
and quality that Claimant did not have a mold allergy and that Claimant's conditions were not otherwise caused by exposure to mold in the workplace. In his remaining sub-arguments, Claimant requests that the court reassess the weight of the evidence presented at the Hearing. As discussed above, we decline to disturb the LIRAB's evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the LIRAB did
 
not err when it found that Employer presented relevant and
 credible evidence of a quality and quantity sufficient to justify
 a conclusion by a reasonable person that Claimant's injuries are
 not connected to his work.
 
(2) Claimant argues that the LIRAB erred in crediting
 
Dr. Likewise's opinion, which he characterizes as a "fictional
 essay," because Claimant was (based on his own assessment)
 healthy prior to work at Employer's Kaneohe store. It appears,
 however, that Dr. Likewise's opinion was based on his examination
 and a battery of psychological tests performed on Claimant, as
 
3 FOF 17 and 18 provides: 
[FOF 17]: Employer has not presented any
evidence that contradicts the presence of the alleged
black mold at the workplace. Therefore, the Board
finds that, for purposes of this Decision and Order,
such black or dark substance was evidence that mold
 was present in the area of Claimant's work environment
during the period in question. 
[FOF 18]: The Board further finds that Claimant
was exposed to such mold. 
13

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as Claimant's extensive medical data and records, which
 
indicated that Claimant had seen literally dozens of health
 professions for multiple symptoms.
4 Upon review, we cannot
 
conclude that the LIRAB erred in crediting the opinion of Dr.
 Likewise. 
(3) Claimant argues that the LIRAB erroneously
 
excluded Dr. Hope's declaration (Exhibit A-1), Dr. Hope's
 
credentials (Exhibit B), and articles on Dr. Arora (Exhibit FF).
5
  
Claimant contends that the LIRAB's exclusion of his exhibits and
 
acceptance of the Employer's IME reports was erroneous and

 
prejudicial. 
This court is not able to properly review what was
 
presented before the LIRAB as there are no transcripts of the

 
June 14, 2013 and June 17, 2013 hearing in the record.
 
4 From 2004 to 2007, Claimant was evaluated by multiple doctors,
including but not limited to, Dr. Mark Baker, Dr. Robert Canonico, Dr. Michael
W. Chan, Dr. Bernard K. Chun, Dr. Wooyoung W. Chung, Dr. Gregory A. Cogert,
Dr. Benedicto Galindo, Dr. Sorbella Guillermo, Dr. Linda L. Jenks, Dr.
Katherine S.H. Jim, Dr. Darryl M. Kan, Dr. Eugene Kitts, Dr. E. Howard
Klemmer, Dr. Peter C.S. Lee, Dr. S. James Lee, Dr. Clyde T. Miyaki, Dr.
Timothy H. Moon, Dr. Joel Peck, Dr. Philip Suh, Dr. Byron M.W. Wong, and Dr.
Melvin H.C. Yee, seeking treatment for abdominal pain, back pain, blurred
vision, chest pain, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, earaches,
fever, headaches, heart burn, a laceration to his left index finger,
lightheadedness, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, and shoulder pain.
In addition, after the alleged August 31, 2007 workplace injury, from 2008 to
2010, in addition to the testifying doctors, Claimant was evaluated by
multiple doctors, including but not limited to, Dr. Harry Acuna, Dr. Kristi
Adachi, Dr. Carmen Baybayan, Dr. Michael Bornemann, Dr. Michael W. Chan, Dr.
Jason K. Fleming, Dr. Darryl M. Kan, Dr. Eugene Kitts, Dr. Brandt K.
Lapschies, Dr. Peter C.S. Lee, Dr. Herbert Lim, Dr. Clyde T. Miyaki, Dr.
Wilson T. Murakami, Dr. Thinh T. Nguyen, Dr. Joel Peck, Dr. Natalie Relles,
Dr. Wayne M. Suga, Dr. Curtis Takemoto-Gentile, Dr. Sherrie M. Takushi, Dr.
Brian A. Tobe, and Dr. David C. Wei for abdominal pain, chest pain, diarrhea,
epigastric pain, facial numbness, GERD, hyperthyroidism, nausea, near syncope,
palpitations, prostatitis, shortness of breath, shoulder pain, skin
irritation, sleep apnea, sore throat, and tinnitus. 
5
 As described in Claimant's exhibit list, Exhibit FF consists of,
inter alia, articles on Dr. Arora, disciplined physicians list, summary of
administrative actions, accusations and/or petitions to revoke probation filed
against Dr. Arora, physician's health grades, and Dr. Arora's sanctions and
complaint history in California.
 
14

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Nevertheless, upon review of the LIRAB's March 10, 2014 Decision
 
and Order, it appears that the LIRAB excluded Exhibits A-1, B,
 and FF, because the exhibits were not timely submitted. With
 regard to Exhibit A-1 and B, the LIRAB found that "Claimant did
 not file a motion [or] enter into a stipulation to allow for the
 inclusion of Dr. Hope's declaration or other material after the
 various deadlines." The LIRAB further noted that the Claimant
 did not file a motion to extend deadlines, "which would have
 allowed Dr. Hope's Declaration to be submitted after the relevant
 deadline." With regard to Exhibit FF, the LIRAB concluded that
 all evidence, with the exception of deposition transcripts of a
 deposition taken before the discovery deadline, must be filed by
 the discovery deadline. The LIRAB did not credit Claimant's
 argument that medical article-type exhibits were not required to
 be filed pursuant to the medical reports deadline or discovery
 deadline. 
The LIRAB "may enter a pretrial order" establishing 
medical report and discovery deadlines. Hawai
'i Administrative 
Rules (HAR) § 12-47-22 (West 2017). A medical report deadline is 
"the date that all medical reports or records shall be filed at 
the board." HAR § 12-47-22(b)(3). A discovery deadline is "the date that all non-medical documents or records shall be filed at the board, except that the transcript of an oral deposition of any individual conducted before such deadline may be filed after such deadline." HAR § 12-47-22(b)(4). Furthermore, this court has recognized that the LIRAB has "'wide discretion in managing evidence[,]' and the LIRAB's evidentiary rulings should be 
15
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
upheld, absent a showing of an abuse of discretion." Athens v.

It was within the LIRAB's discretion to exclude the
 
Claimant's exhibits as untimely. Claimant does not provide a
 reasonable explanation for his failure to submit Exhibits A-1, B,
 and FF, prior to the medical reports and discovery deadlines. 
Gabriel v. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, No. 29789, 2013 WL
 6008490, at *7 (Haw. App. Nov. 12, 2013) (mem. op.). 
Furthermore, Claimant fails to provide any evidence demonstrating
 prejudicial treatment with respect to the LIRAB's admission of
 exhibits. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Claimant's
 point of error is without merit.
 
(4) In CAAP-16-0000029, Claimant contends that the 
LIRAB erred by not remanding the proceedings for a ruling on the merits, arguing that the LIRAB failed to comply with the Hawai
'i 
Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), HRS chapter 91 (2012 and 
Supp. 2016), and engaged in improper rulemaking when it vacated 
the Director's decision in its December 22, 2015 Decision and Order.

 HAR § 12-47-41 provides: 
The board shall not be bound by statutory and common
law rules relating to the admission or rejection of
evidence. The board may exercise its own discretion in these
matters, limited only by considerations of relevancy,
materiality, and repetition, by the rules of privilege
recognized by law, and with a view to securing a just,
speedy, and inexpensive determination of the proceedings.

Under HAPA, a rule is defined as an "agency statement 
of general or particular applicability and future effect that 
implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency." HRS § 91-1(4) (2012). The definition of "rule" "does not include regulations concerning only the internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights of or procedures available to the public, nor does the term include declaratory rulings issued pursuant to section 91–8, nor intra-agency memoranda." Id. In a recent opinion, the supreme court 
explained that the definition of "rule" has two elements. Green 
Party of Haw. v. Nago, 138 Hawai
'i 228, 237, 378 P.3d 944, 953 
(2016). "The first element is that the agency statement be of (a) general or particular applicability and (b) future effect. The second element provides that the agency statement (a) implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or (b) describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency." Id. Furthermore, the "purpose of rule-making is 
to govern the future conduct of groups and individuals, not determining damages resulting from past conduct." Id. at 238, 
378 P.3d at 954 (quoting Pila
'a 400 LLC v. Bd. of Land & Nat. 
Res., 132 Hawai 'i 247, 266, 320 P.3d 912, 931 (2014)). 
Claimant argues that the LIRAB engaged in rulemaking
 
when it vacated the Director's decision in excess of its
 
7
authority under HRS § 386-87 (2015)  to "affirm, reverse or

modify any compensation case upon review, or remand the case to 
the director for further proceedings and action." In its December 22, 2015 Decision and Order, the LIRAB vacated the Director's decision denying the November 21, 2011 claim as a new or subsequent injury claim. The LIRAB found that the November 21, 2011 claim was filed by Claimant to amend the September 3, 2010 claim for an August 31, 2007 injury. The LIRAB also determined that the issue of timeliness and compensability were resolved in the March 10, 2014 Decision and Order. The LIRAB's decision to vacate the Director's decision is not a "rule" under HAPA because it is not a statement of general or particular applicability that governs future conduct. Green Party, 138 
Hawai
'i at 238, 378 P.3d at 954. The LIRAB's decision to vacate 
was specific to and dependent upon the factual circumstances and procedural history of the case. There is no indication that the LIRAB's decision to vacate will impact the future rights of other claimants seeking compensation. As such, we are not persuaded by Claimant's contention that the LIRAB engaged in improper rulemaking under HAPA. 
Finally, Claimant argues that the LIRAB lacked the
 
statutory authority to allow Dr. Arora's IME under HRS § 386-79
 
7(...continued)
(c) The appellate board shall have power to review the
findings of fact, conclusions of law and exercise of
discretion by the director in hearing, determining or
otherwise handling of any compensation case and may affirm,
reverse or modify any compensation case upon review, or
remand the case to the director for further proceedings and
action.

(2015).8 However, Claimant does not provide any record
 
citations to where in the record he raised this argument. This
 
is insufficient under Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(7), which provides that the opening brief should
 include an argument section "containing the contentions of the
 appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with
 citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record
 relied on" and that "[p]oints not argued may be deemed waived." 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); see also Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn &
 Stifel, 117 Hawai
'i 92, 114 n.23, 176 P.3d 91, 113 n.23 (2008) 
("this court is not obligated to sift through the voluminous
 record to verify an appellant's inadequately documented
 contentions." (citation and brackets omitted)). Furthermore,
 this court is not able to properly review what was presented
 before the LIRAB as there are no transcripts of the August 26,
 2014, August 27, 2014, and September 26, 2014 hearing in the
 
8 HRS § 386-79 provides in relevant part: 
§386-79 Medical examination by employer's physician.
After an injury and during the period of disability, the
employee, whenever ordered by the director of labor and
industrial relations, shall submit to examination, at
reasonable times and places, by a duly qualified physician
or surgeon designated and paid by the employer. The employee
shall have the right to have a physician or surgeon
designated and paid by the employee present at the
examination, which right, however, shall not be construed to
deny to the employer's physician the right to visit the
injured employee at all reasonable times and under all
reasonable conditions during total disability.
 
. . . . 
Employer requested examinations under this section
shall not exceed more than one per case unless good and
valid reasons exist with regard to the medical progress of
the employee's treatment. The cost of conducting the ordered
medical examination shall be limited to the complex
consultation charges governed by the medical fee schedule
established pursuant to section 386-21(c).

 As we conclude that the LIRAB did not err in vacating the
Director's decision on the grounds that Claimant did not make a new claim, we
do not address Claimant's argument that the LIRAB should have determined
whether the Employer presented substantial evidence to rebut Claimant's
further evidence and the presumption of compensability.
