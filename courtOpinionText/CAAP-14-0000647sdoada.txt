Defendants-Appellants Sharon Kehaulani Wise and Blossom
 
Ilima Nihipali (Appellants) appeal from the February 25, 2014
 
"Order Denying [Appellants' Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule] 60(b)(4) Motion For Relief From the Courts [sic] (1)
 
May 12, 2010 Order Granting Summary Judgment and (2) Related And
 
Consequential Orders and Judgments" entered in the Circuit Court

of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Appellants' appeal is without merit.
 
On May 6, 2009, Plaintiff-Appellee Mortgage Electronic
 
Registration Systems, Inc., (MERS) filed a Complaint for
 
Foreclosure against Appellants. On July 13, 2009, MERS filed a
 
"Request to Clerk to Enter Defaults of [Appellants] as to
 Complaint Filed on May 6, 2009" because Appellants failed to
 answer or otherwise defend against the Complaint. The clerk of
 the court signed an Entry of Default on July 13, 2009.
 
On May 12, 2010, the circuit court entered Judgment
 
pursuant to the May 12, 2010 "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of
 Law; Order Granting Motion For Summary Judgment as Against All
 Defendants and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure."
 Appellants did not appeal from the Judgment.
 
On March 10, 2011, Appellants filed "[Appellants']
 
Motion to Set Aside Clerk's Entry of Default As to Them."
 
On April 29, 2011, the circuit court issued an "Order
 
Approving Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner's Sale
 of Property at Public Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds,
 for Writ of Possession and for Disposal of Personal Property"
 (Order Approving Report) and the Judgment entered pursuant to the
 
Order Approving Report.
 
On May 10, 2011, the circuit court issued an "Order
 
Denying [Appellants'] Motion to Set Aside Clerk's Entry of
 
Defaults As to Them Filed on March 20, 2011."
 
On May 31, 2011, Appellants filed a notice of appeal 
from the Order Approving Report under appellate case no. CAAP-11Â­0000444. This court affirmed the Order Approving Report by Summary Disposition Order issued November 29, 2012. On June 28, 2013, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, in turn, affirmed this court's 
judgment. Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc., v. 
Wise, 130 Hawai 'i 11, 304 P.3d 1192 (2013). 
On December 10, 2013, Appellants filed "[Appellants']
 
HRCP 60(b)(4) Motion For Relief From the Court's (1) May 12, 2010
 Order Granting Summary Judgment and (2) Related And Consequential
 Orders and Judgments." Appellants contended that MERS lacked

standing and therefore the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to
 
enter said orders and judgments. On February 25, 2014, the
 circuit court denied their motion and on March 27, 2014,
 Appellants filed the notice of appeal in the instant case.
 
In Appellants' prior appeal, the jurisdiction of the 
circuit court was affirmed by this court's decision, and the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that Appellants' standing claim was 
barred by res judicata. See id. at 19 & n.13, 304 P.3d at 1200 & 
n.13. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in denying
 
Appellants' HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion for relief. See id.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying Defendants
 
Sharon Kehaulani Wise and Blossom Ilima Nihipali's HRCP 60(b)(4)
 Motion For Relief From the Courts [sic] (1) May 12, 2010 Order
 Granting Summary Judgment and (2) Related And Consequential
 Orders and Judgments" entered February 25, 2014 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
