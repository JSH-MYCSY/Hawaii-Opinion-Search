SCOTT SPITTLER,
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant,
v.
 
PAUL R. CHARBONNEAU, et al.,
Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellees,
and
 
ELIZABETH THERESA SCHMIDT,
Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0007)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff/
 
Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Scott Spittler and Defendant/
 Cross-Claim Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellant Elizabeth
 Theresa Schmidt have asserted from the Honorable Greg K.
 Nakamura's February 26, 2014 judgment, because the February 26,
 2014 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1993 & Supp. 2013), Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 "there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.
If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all
other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."

Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphasis added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. 
(original emphasis). 
The February 26, 2014 judgment vaguely enters judgment 
in favor of and against, among other persons, a single person whom the circuit court vaguely identifies with a single name, "Charbonneau," despite that there are two separate and distinct parties in this case who share that same last name: 
(1) Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Cross-Claim

Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Paul R.
Charbonneau (Appellee Paul Charbonneau), and 
(2) Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Cross-Claim
Plaintiff/Cross-Claim Defendant/Appellee Janice
Charbonneau (Appellee Janice Charbonneau).
 
The February 26, 2014 judgment does not clearly identify whether
 
the circuit court is entering judgment as to (a) Appellee Paul
 Charbonneau, (b) Appellee Janice Charbonneau, or (c) both
 Appellee Paul Charbonneau and Appellee Janice Charbonneau. 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Without specifically identifying all parties in favor of and
 
against whom the circuit court intends to enter judgment, the
 February 26, 2014 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for
 an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58
 and the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final judgment
 in this case, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000659.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0000659 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
