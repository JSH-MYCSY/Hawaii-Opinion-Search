ORDER

 
(1)
 DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION;
AND

 
(2)
 ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR STAY AS MOOT
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-14-0000681, it
 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by
 
Intervenor-Defendant-Appellant State of Hawai 'i Organization of 
Police Officers (SHOPO), from the Order Granting Plaintiff's
 Motion for Summary Judgment (Filed December 17, 2013), filed on
 March 27, 2014. 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 27, 2014, the circuit court entered an Order 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Filed December 
17, 2013). The order explained the circuit court's rationale for granting the motion for summary judgment by Plaintiff-Appellee Peer News LLC, dba Civil Beat (Civil Beat). However, the order was not certified, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedures 
(HRCP) Rule 54(b), and the record on appeal does not contain a judgment on the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Filed December 17, 2013). 
On March 28, 2014, SHOPO filed a Notice of Appeal from
 
the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Filed
 December 17, 2013). On May 22, 2014, SHOPO filed a Motion for
 Stay Upon Appeal with this court. 
HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2013) authorizes appeals to the
 
intermediate court of appeals from "final judgments, orders, or
 decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be
 taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS
 § 641-1(c). Rule 58, HRCP requires that "[e]very judgment shall
 be set forth on a separate document." 
An order granting summary judgment is not a judgment
 
within the meaning of HRCP Rule 58. M. F. Williams, Inc. v. City
 
and County of Honolulu, 3 Haw. App. 319, 322-23, 650 P.2d 599,
 601-02 (1982). 
Under HRCP Rule 58, the supreme court has held that 
"[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); Alford v. City and County of Honolulu, 109 Hawai
'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) ("[A]n 
order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." (Citation omitted; emphasis added)).

The Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment (Filed December 17, 2013) is also not certified as an
 
appealable interlocutory order, pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). The
 finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b) is "an
 express determination that there is no just reason for delay . .
 . for the entry of judgment." HRCP Rule 54(b). "[A] party
 cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order
 may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order
 must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b)
 certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer
 
v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai
'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 
(1994). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment (Filed December 17, 2013) does not contain the required
 HRCP Rule 54(b) language that "there is no just reason for delay
 . . . for the entry of judgment," and was not entered in favor
 and against any party. Thus, it is not appealable pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 54(b).
 
There is also no separate judgment in the record on
 
appeal. Therefore, even if the order was property certified, it
 is not appealable for lack of a separate judgment. 
Absent an appealable final judgment in this case, this
 
appeal is premature, and the intermediate court of appeals lacks
 appellate jurisdiction. When the intermediate court of appeals
 determines that it lacks jurisdiction, the only appropriate
 remedy is dismissal of the appellate case:
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court considering
and resolving an appeal or original action. Appellate courts, upon
determining that they lack jurisdiction shall not require anything
other than a dismissal of the appeal or action. Without
jurisdiction, a court is not in a position to consider the case
further. Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The lack
of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by any party at
any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a jurisdictional defect in
an appeal, we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal.

ellipsis points omitted; emphasis added); Peterson v. Hawaii 
Electric Light Company, Inc., 85 Hawai 'i 322, 326, 944 P.2d 1265, 
1269 (1997), superseded on other grounds by HRS § 269-15.5 (Supp. 1999); Pele Defense Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 77 Hawai
'i 
64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 (1994). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appeal No. CAAP­
13-0003147 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion for Stay, filed
 
by SHOPO, on May 22, 2014 is dismissed as moot.
