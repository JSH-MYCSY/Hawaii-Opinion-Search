APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-05574)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Fred Y. Mikawa (Mikawa) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and

 
Plea/Judgment, filed on February 27, 2014, in the District Court
 
of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1
 
After a fact stipulated trial, Mikawa was convicted of
 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII),
 in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3)
 (Supp. 2014).

§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant.  (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 . . . .
 (3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath.

On appeal, Mikawa contends the District Court erred by
 
(1) denying his Motion to Suppress because he was not provided
 
3
with a Miranda  warning, in violation of his rights under article
1, section 10 of the Hawai 'i Constitution, when asked if he would 
submit to a breath, blood, or urine test thereby incriminating 
himself if he refused to do so; (2) denying his Motion to Suppress because he was misinformed that he had no right to an attorney, in violation of HRS § 803-9 (2014); (3) denying his Motion to Suppress because a breath sample was taken without a warrant and without an exception to the warrant requirement, in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and Missouri v. McNeely, 133 S. Ct. 1552 (2013); and (4) not suppressing his breath test results because he was improperly informed of sanctions for refusing to take a breath, blood, or urine test in violation of State v. Wilson, 92 Hawai
'i 45, 987 P.2d 268 (1999). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mikawa's points of error as follows:
 
(1) A Miranda warning was not required to be given to 
Mikawa before determining whether he would submit to a breath, blood, or urine test. State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 74, 332 P.3d 
661, 674 (App. 2014), cert. granted, No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2014 WL 2881259 (June 24, 2014). 
(2) Mikawa was not improperly advised that he was not
 
entitled to an attorney in violation of HRS § 803-9. Id. at 74,
 
332 P.3d at 676. 
(3) Mikawa's reliance on McNeely is misplaced because
 
McNeely resolved "a split of authority on the question whether
 the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream establishes
 a per se exigency that suffices on its own to justify an
 exception to the warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood
 testing in drunk-driving investigations." McNeely, 133 S. Ct. 
3
 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

at 1558 (emphasis added). In this case, Mikawa consented to take
 
a breath test. 
Mikawa contends that his consent was coerced because he 
was informed he "shall" be subject to thirty days jail if he refused to take a breath, blood or urine test. Mikawa claims he was informed that he "'shall' be subject to 30 days jail unless he consented to blood, or the breath test he eventually agreed to take" which is coercive. The Implied Consent Form actually provided inter alia that "if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable." The use of the phrase "subject to up to" conveyed the contingent nature of the sanction and it is common knowledge that imprisonment is a criminal punishment that is triggered by a conviction. Won, 134 Hawai
'i at 75-76, 332 
P.3d at 677-78. 
Mikawa also contends that he may limit or withdraw his
 
implied consent. Mikawa did not testify, and there is no
 evidence in the record from the fact stipulated trial that Mikawa
 revoked his implied consent. In addition, Mikawa expressly
 agreed to take a breath alcohol test despite being informed that
 he may refuse the test. Therefore, this argument is without
 merit.
 
(4) Mikawa contends that he was improperly advised of
 
sanctions for refusing testing before he actually refused
 testing, and that he was only advised of a portion of the
 sanctions, in contradiction to HRS §§ 291E-11 (2007) and 291E-15
 (Supp. 2014) and thus, in violation of the holding in 
Wilson. 
 
When 
Wilson was decided, the implied consent statutes
 
required that:
 
Upon informing the arrestee of his or her choice of taking a
breath test, blood test, or both, "[t]he arresting officer
shall also inform the person of the sanctions under this
part, including the sanction for refusing to take a breath
or a blood test." HRS § 286–151 likewise requires that "the
test or tests shall be administered ... only after ... [t]he
person has been informed by a police officer of the
sanctions under part XIV and sections 286–151.5 and
286–157.3." (Emphasis added.) Thus, as the statutory
language makes clear, a driver's "implied consent" to an
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidentiary chemical alcohol test is qualified by his or her
implied right to refuse such a test after being accurately
informed of his or her statutory right to consent or refuse,
as well as the consequences of such consent or refusal.
 
92 Hawai 'i at 49, 987 P.2d at 272 (citation and block format 
omitted) (underline emphasis added). 
Given the amendments to the implied consent statutes
 
since Wilson was decided in 1999, police are now required to
 
inform an arrested person of sanctions only after the person
 refuses testing. HRS § 291E-15. However, no statute prohibits
 the police from informing an arrested person of the statutory
 consequences of refusing testing prior to refusing such testing.
 
Moreover, although Mikawa also argues that he was only
 
informed about part of the sanctions, apparently contending that
 the specific sanctions for administrative remedies should have
 also been included in the advisement, the advisement given to
 Mikawa did reference sanctions under Chapter 291E, Part III,
 which sets out the administrative penalties for refusing testing. 
Mikawa fails to assert how this affected his rights, or violated
 the current implied consent statutes. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on
 February 27, 2014, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division is affirmed.
