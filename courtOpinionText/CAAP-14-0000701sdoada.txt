STATE OF HAWAI 'I and MELANIE CHINEN,
Defendants-Appellees,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1193)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
This appeal arises out of an employment dispute in
 
which the employee alleges protection under the Hawai 'i 
Whistleblowers Protection Act ("Act"), Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
section 378-62 (Supp. 2005).1/  Plaintiff-Appellant David Brown
 
1/
 The Act provides in relevant part that:
 
An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or otherwise
discriminate against an employee regarding the employee's
compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of
employment because:
 
(1) 	The employee, or a person acting on behalf of the
employee, reports or is about to report to the
employer, or reports or is about to report to a
public body, verbally or in writing, a violation
or a suspected violation of:
 
(A)	 A law, rule, ordinance, or regulation,
adopted pursuant to law of this State, a
political subdivision of this State, or the
United States; or
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeals from the February 27, 2014 Final Judgment entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court")2/ in favor
 
of Defendants-Appellees State of Hawai 'i and Melanie Chinen 
("Chinen"), former Administrator of the State Historic
 Preservation Division ("SHPD") (collectively known as the
 "Appellees"); and Defendants Bob Awana and Ashley Chinen. 
On appeal, Brown alleges that the Circuit Court erred
 
when it (1) concluded that Chinen's testimony was more credible
 than Brown's testimony; (2) concluded that Brown failed to make a
 prima facie case for whistleblowing; (3) considered the hearsay
 testimony of Brown's coworkers; and (4) did not consider Brown's
 March 12, 2013, motion to strike the State's proposed findings of
 fact ("FOFs") and conclusions of law ("COLs").
3/
  
(B)	 A contract executed by the State, a
political subdivision of the State, or the
United States, 
unless the employee knows that the report is false[.]
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 378-62(1).

 The Honorable Karl Sakamoto presided.

 Brown's points of error have been rewritten for clarity and
organization, but appear in his opening brief as follows:
 
1.	 In [FOF & COL] ¶¶5-8, 11-30, 46, the lower court erred
by concluding that Chinen was a credible witness when
she should have been considered a false witness. The
 lower court should have relied on the testimony of
Brown, not on Chinen who was caught in at least 12
lies;
 
2.	 In [FOF & COL] ¶¶43-45, 63, the lower court in error
concluded that Plaintiff did not report a violation of
law;
 
3.	 In [FOF & COL] ¶¶47, 64-66, the lower court erred,
when quoting Chinen's accusations against Brown as
evidence of his poor performance when in reality,
those accusations were fabricated. Furthermore, these
fabricated accusations were part of the retaliation
against Brown;
 
4.	 In [FOF & COL] ¶¶9, 25-27, the lower court erred when
considering deposition testimony that lacked
foundation as more credible than the direct testimony
of Brown and others. Furthermore, the treatment of
this deposition testimony was biased and incomplete
because deposition testimony was taken out of context
and without proper foundation.
 
5.	 In [FOF & COL] ¶¶24, 32, the lower court erred in
including hearsay evidence.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties,4/ as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Brown's
 appeal as follows and affirm.
 
(1 & 2) Brown essentially asserts that the Circuit
 
Court erred in finding that Chinen's testimony was more credible
 than his own and in concluding, based on this credibility
 determination, that he failed to make a prima facie case for
 whistleblowing. Brown cites to no legal authority to support his
 contentions, and we conclude that Brown's first and second points
 of error are without merit.
 
The "at-will" employment doctrine "recognizes an 
employer's right to discharge 'for good cause, for no cause or even for cause morally wrong[.]'" Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc., 94 
Hawai
'i 368, 382-83, 14 P.3d 1049, 1063-64 (2000) (quoting Parnar 
v. Americana Hotels, Inc., 65 Haw. 370, 374-75, 652 P.2d 625, 628 (1982)). "[I]n the absence of a written employment agreement, a collective bargaining agreement, or a statutorily-conferred right, employment is at-will." Id. at 383, 14 P.3d at 1064. 
Accordingly, at-will employment is generally "terminable at the will of either party, for any reason or no reason at all." Id. 
(quoting Best Place, Inc. v. Penn Am. Ins. Co., 82 Hawai
'i 120, 
124 n.5, 920 P.2d 334, 357 n.5 (1996)). 
6.	 The lower court erred in not considering Brown's
motion dated March 12, 2013 and attached as Exhibit B
in Plaintiff's notice.
 
4/
 Brown's opening brief violates Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28 in several respects, including his appendingexhibits 59, 98, 105, and 160 when those exhibits were not entered intoevidence or made a part of the record on appeal (HRAP Rule 28(b)(10)), hisfailure to identify where in the record any alleged errors are objected to(HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii)), his failure to offer any legal authority in supportof several of his points of error or in support of numerous contentions madethroughout the brief, and the fact that his arguments appear at timesuntethered to his points of error (HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)). Furthermore, thebrief violates HRAP 32(b) when all footnotes are reduced in size.Nevertheless, noncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result in dismissalof the claims and "[t]his court . . . has consistently adhered to the policyof affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the
merits, where possible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai' i 173, 180–81,
86 P.3d 982, 989–90 (2004 (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 
383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)). Therefore, we proceed to address Brown's
points and arguments to the extent that we are able. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Chinen hired Brown to be the SHPD Archaeological Branch
 
Chief. The branch chief was an "exempt" position, which was
 
"temporary [in] nature and renewable on an annual basis." 
Specifically, Brown's contract stated that his employment was
 "not to exceed" June 30, 2006. Therefore, Brown was an "at-will"
 employee. See id. 
However, there are public policy exceptions to the
 
general rule. Id. at 384, 14 P.3d at 1065 ("[W]here the
 
'discharge of an employee violates a clear mandate of public
 policy[,]' his or her 'employer [should] be . . . liable in
 tort.'" (quoting Parnar, 65 Haw. at 380, 652 P.2d at 631.)). The
 Act is a public policy exception to the at-will doctrine. See
 
Smith v. Chaney Brooks Realty, Inc., 10 Haw. App. 250, 256-57,
 865 P.2d 170, 173-74 (App. 1994) (determining that "an employer's
 generally unlimited right to discharge an at will employee does
 not extend to a termination that conflicts with state public
 policy[,]" for example, "performing an important public
 obligation, such as jury duty, whistle blowing, or refusing to
 violate a professional code of ethics[.]"). 
In order to prevail under the Act, Brown must 
demonstrate a "causal connection" between the non-renewal of his contract and his alleged whistleblowing. Crosby v. State Dep't 
of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai
'i 332, 342, 876 P.2d 1300, 1310 
(1994). Brown has the burden of showing that his conduct was protected and a "substantial or motivating factor" in his non-renewal. Id. Brown contests FOFs 43-45, and COL 63, and alleges that
 
he "told Chinen that the policies and procedures concerning
 Dowsett Heights, SuperFerry, Wal-Mart, General Growth Properties,
 and Kaloko Heights [projects] were in violation of State law,
 Federal laws, and the standards that govern the profession of
 archaeology." Brown additionally challenges FOFs 5-9, 11-30,
 25–27, 46, 47, and 64-66, contending that the court erroneously
 evaluated the credibility of various witnesses, and specifically
 that his testimony should have been credited over Chinen's. 
Further, Brown asserts that "Chinen removed [him] from projects,
 . . . those projects ended with violations of laws, and then [he]
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
was terminated based on falsified evidence[,]" thus proving that
 
"Chinen HEARD Brown 'blow the whistle'." (Emphasis in original.)
 
Brown's contentions are based on the testimony that he
 
offered to the Circuit Court, which he now asks us to credit over
 Chinen's testimony to the contrary. Brown does not demonstrate
 that the Circuit Court clearly erred in its implicit finding that
 Chinen's testimony—that Brown did not inform her of violations of
 the law—was more believable than Brown's.
 
The appellate court does not pass upon the trial 
court's decisions with regard to the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence. "It is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of fact; the judge may accept or reject any witness's testimony in whole or in part." Porter v. Au, 116 Hawai
'i 42, 
59–60, 169 P.3d 994, 1011–12 (App. 2007) (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996)). FOFs 43 
and 44 are not clearly erroneous because they are supported by the Circuit Court's reference to Chinen's testimony, which the Circuit Court implicitly found credible. FOF 45 is not clearly erroneous because Brown fails to cite to any contradictory evidence other than his own testimony, which the Circuit Court has already implicitly found was not believable, to support his claim. Finally, COL 63, which we review as presenting a mixed question of fact and law, is not clearly erroneous for the same reasons that FOFs 43–45 are not clearly erroneous. 
Brown's challenge to FOFs 5-8, 11-30, and 46 on the
 
basis that he should have been found to be more credible than
 Chinen, his challenge to FOF 47 and COLs 64-66 on the basis that
 Chinen's accusations were fabricated, and his challenge to FOFs 9
 and 25-27 on the basis that the witnesses' deposition testimony
 was less credible than the direct testimony of Brown and others,
 suffer the same fate. See n.3, supra (POE 1, 3, and 4). Brown
 
relies on summaries of trial testimony to support his challenges,
 but provides no legal argument. Each of the challenged FOFs
 refer to corresponding testimony and are supported by substantial
 evidence. Additionally, the challenged COLs, which present mixed
 questions of fact and law, are also supported in their factual
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
underpinnings. Consequently, none of them are clearly erroneous.
 
In sum, the Circuit Court, in light of its credibility
 
determination and factual findings, did not err in concluding
 
that Brown did not establish a prima facie case of a violation
 under the Act because Brown did not demonstrate that he reported
 or threatened to report a violation of a law, rule, ordinance, or
 regulation. See Shoppe, 94 Hawai
'i at 378, 14 P.3d at 1059 
(stating that under the framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
 Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), the plaintiff must establish the
 elements of a prima facie case by a preponderance of the
 evidence).
 
(3)
 Brown contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
considering hearsay evidence as part of FOFs 24 and 32.5/  FOFs
 
5/
 Although not addressed in his points of error, Brown argues that
FOFs 39 and 46 should be stricken because they, too, include inadmissible
hearsay relating to comments allegedly made by Department of Land and NaturalResources ("DLNR") Chair Peter Young and Deputy Attorney General VinceKanemoto, respectively. Brown fails to identify where in the record heobjected to the receipt of testimony of or about Young or Kanemoto and, moreimportantly, provides no legal argument in support of his contention.Accordingly, Brown's argument with regard to FOFs 39 and 46 is waived on
appeal and will not be considered further. See Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127
Hawai'i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012). 
Furthermore, and without reference to any FOFs, COLs, or any of
his points of error, Brown contends that testimony from Nancy McMahon, a Kauai
archeologist, and Mary Ann Maigret, a Big Island archeologist, must be
stricken "to the extent it involves inadmissible hearsay." After advancing
the contention, Brown fails to identify any particular testimony and offers no
argument explaining how it amounts to hearsay or whether it had been objected
to at trial. Again, then, the argument is waived and will not be considered
further.
 
Brown also contends, without identifying the issue as a point of
error, that no foundation was laid as to either McMahon or Maigret's knowledge
of Brown's job responsibility, that their testimonies were irrelevant to
proving that Brown was removed for performance, and that the testimonies must
be stricken "in that [they] attempt[] to offer expert opinion." Brown does
 not identify a particular FOF or COL that was supported by the McMahon or
Maigret testimony. Even if we assume that Brown's argument relates to FOF 25­29 and COL 64, which he has contested, the testimonies in question do not
appear to require any familiarity with Brown's job responsibilities in order
to allow the Circuit Court to make the findings it made or to reach the
conclusion that it reached, nor do they appear to offer expert opinion, and
Brown does not explain how they do. Furthermore, while not relevant to the
Appellees' position that as an at-will employee, Brown could be discharged and
was not renewed for no reason whatsoever, the testimony did relate to the
alternative argument which the Circuit Court apparently found persuasive, that
Appellees' decision was not pretextual in light of Brown's performance.
 
Finally, and again unrelated to any of his points of error, Brown
contends that the Circuit Court erred in "denying testimony to impeach McMahon
and Maigret." Brown makes no evident argument with regard to Maigret, and so
the contention is waived and will not be considered further. With regard to
impeaching McMahon, Brown explains that the Circuit Court did not permit Brown

24 and 32 state that:
 
24.	 On June 8, 2006, the Branch Chief for Architecture Susan
Tasaki complained in writing to CHINEN that BROWN
 intimidated her. The subject of her complaint was
entitled "Harassment by co-worker." (Ex. A-14.)
 
32.	 Piilani Chang ("CHANG") worked at SHPD at the same time
that BROWN did. CHANG had heard of one or two occasions
 where some people in the Hawaiian community were
offended by remarks BROWN had made. (Day 2 Trial Tr.
86:25-87:4.)
 
In support of his contention, Brown contends that "any testimony
 
by Susan Tasaki must be stricken to the degree it includes
 inadmissible hearsay." Brown provides no legal support for any
 of his hearsay assertions.
 
It is well established that this jurisdiction generally 
"prohibits an appellant from complaining for the first time on appeal of error to which he has acquiesced or to which he failed to object." Price v. AIG Hawai
'i Ins. Co., 107 Hawai 'i 106, 111, 
111 P.3d 1, 6 (2005) (quoting Okuhara v. Broida, 51 Haw. 253, 255, 456 P.2d 228, 230 (1969)); see also Haw. Rev. Stat. § 641-2 (Supp. 2011). 
In this case, with regard to Tasaki and Chang, Brown 
fails to state in his opening brief where in the record the alleged hearsay errors were objected to. With regard to Chang, Brown's counsel appears to have made no objection to Chang's statements during trial. In fact, the transcript shows that it was Brown who asked Chang the question which solicited the answer to which he now objects. Accordingly, Brown's contention as to Chang is waived. Price, 107 Hawai
'i at 111, 111 P.3d at 6. 
With regard to Tasaki, Brown clarifies the location of
 
his objection in the record in his reply brief. However, HRAP
 Rule 28(b)(4)(iii) requires that Brown provide in the opening
 
to question Pua Aiu about McMahon's credibility, but said that Brown could
recall the witness to raise impeachment at the proper time. Because Appellees
never called McMahon as a witness at trial, but instead introduced her
testimony via deposition, Brown contends that he was denied the opportunity to
impeach. Brown further explains that he subpoenaed DLNR Chair Laura Thielen
to testify about McMahon, but "since Defendant State never called McMahon,
Plaintiff never called Thielen or attempted to ask Aiu or [Deputy Attorney
General Jim Halvorson] at trial." Brown does not contend and certainly does
not demonstrate that he made any effort to introduce impeachment testimony "at
the proper time" as the court had indicated it would allow, and thus does not
demonstrate that the Circuit Court refused to allow the introduction of other
 witness testimony to impeach McMahon.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
brief "where in the record the alleged error was objected to," 
Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4)(iii), and, therefore, we may deem his
 hearsay contention to be waived. In any event, we conclude that
 Brown's contention with regard to Tasaki is without merit.
 
The State asked Chinen to read paragraph four of
 
Exhibit A14, an email that Tasaki wrote to Chinen regarding
 Brown's behavior. Brown objected "insofar as its hearsay." The
 State clarified that the testimony was being offered to prove
 only that the issue had been brought to Chinen's attention "and
 involve[s] state of mind." With that, Brown withdrew his
 objection, adding "so long as that hearsay objection will
 continue to stand[,]" and the Circuit Court received the exhibit
 into evidence. Therefore, it is clear from the transcript that,
 not only did Brown withdraw his objection to Tasaki's email, but,
 under the circumstances, it was not hearsay at all.
 
(4) Finally, Brown contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in not considering his motion dated March 12, 2013. Brown, however, fails to include any argument in his opening brief regarding this point. Therefore, this point of error is waived on appeal. See Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i at 144 n.16, 276 P.3d at 
713 n.16. 
Based on the foregoing, the February 27, 2014 Final
 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
