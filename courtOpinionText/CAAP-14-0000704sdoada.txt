APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC12-1-1471)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
In this summary-possession case, pro se Defendants/
 
Counterclaimants-Appellants Keith and Sherri Parkinson
 
(collectively, the "Parkinsons") appeal from a March 7, 2014
 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment
 [("MSJ")], Filed on January 10, 2014" ("Order Granting MSJ"),
 which was issued by the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division ("District Court").
1/
 
On appeal, the Parkinsons argue that the District Court
 
erred because (1) the District Court lost subject matter
 jurisdiction over the case under Hawaii District Court Rules of
 Civil Procedure Rule 12.1 once the Parkinsons raised the issue of
 title to the subject property ("Property"); (2) the District
 Court lost jurisdiction over the case when the Parkinsons filed
 their notice of appeal in Case No. CAAP-12-0000541 on May 31,
 2012 ("Notice of Appeal"); and (3) there were genuine issues of
 material fact with regard to issues raised in the MSJ filed by

 The Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes issued the Order Granting MSJ.

the arguments they advance and the issues they raise,3/ we
 
resolve the Parkinsons' points of error by vacating the May 21,
 
2014 "Court Order" that partially granted Mosier's motion for
 attorneys' fees and the June 4, 2014 "Amended Judgment" for
 
4/
attorneys' fees,"  and otherwise affirming the other challenged
orders, including the March 7, 2014 Order Granting MSJ.

 
(1)
 We decline to further address the Parkinsons' first 
point of error, which we resolved in Mosier v. Parkinson, No. CAAP-12-0000541, 2015 WL 1851519 (Hawai
'i App. Apr. 22, 2015) 
(holding that the Parkinsons offered no evidence bringing title into question so as to divest the court of subject matter jurisdiction). Our determination of the issue in Case No. CAAP­12-0000541 is now the "law of the case," and the point cannot be relitigated. Ditto v. McCurdy, 98 Hawai
'i 123, 128, 44 P.3d 274, 
279 (2002). 
(2) The Notice of Appeal did not divest the District
 
Court of jurisdiction to decide claims unrelated to the issue of
 who was entitled to possess the Property. Specifically, it did
 not divest the court of jurisdiction to decide Mosier's claim for
 damages contained in her MSJ or the Parkinsons' counterclaims.
 
The Judgment for Possession resolved the issues of
 
whether the parties had entered into a purchase or a rental
 agreement, and whether the Parkinsons or Mosier breached that
 agreement, and a final ruling on those questions was necessary in
 order to resolve additional claims such as Mosier's request for
 damages in the amount of allegedly unpaid rent and who would be
 responsible for attorneys' fees and in what amount. Therefore,
 
3/
 The Parkinsons claim to incorporate facts and arguments throughout
their opening brief by reference to facts and arguments filed in other briefs
and in other cases. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that incorporating
arguments by reference from the record into an opening brief violates theHawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b)(7) and that such
arguments should be disregarded. Kapiolani Commercial Ctr. v. A & S P'ship,
68 Haw. 580, 584, 723 P.2d 181, 184–85 (1986). While the Parkinsons proceed
pro se and we strive to address such cases on their merits, Housing Fin. and Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85–86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111–12 (1999),
general references to the record do not provide us an adequate basis from
which to do so. 
4/
 Both the May 21, 2014 "Court Order" partially granting Mosier's
motion for attorneys' fees and the June 4, 2014 "Amended Judgment" for
attorneys' fees were issued by the Honorable Hilary Benson Gangnes.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
even though the Judgment for Possession did not resolve all
 
claims against all parties and was not a standard, appealable,
 final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), this court had jurisdiction
 over the appeal in Case No. CAAP-12-0000541 from the Judgment for
 Possession, pursuant to the Forgay doctrine. Ciesla v. Reddish,
 
78 Haw. 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) ("The Forgay doctrine is
 an exception to the finality requirement for appeals and it
 allows an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for
 execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have
 not been finally resolved." (discussing a rule derived from
 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)).
 
"Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests 
the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA 
Int'l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 
735 (1999). However, where, as here—similar to a situation involving HRCP Rule 54(b)—the appealed judgment does not resolve all of the claims in the case, the district court retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining claims (that are not the subject of the appeal) while the appeal is pending. See, e.g., 
Territory v. Damon, 44 Haw. 557, 563, 356 P.2d 386, 390 (1960) ("We think that when an appeal is taken from such judgment, the trial court is divested of jurisdiction over the remainder of the case."); Sturkie v. Han, 2 Haw. App. 140, 146, 627 P.2d 296, 301 (1981) ("[A]n appeal under Rule 54(b) does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed with the other issues in the case."). The Parkinsons cite to no authority holding that this court's jurisdiction over the appeal in Case No. CAAP-12-0000541 on Forgay grounds divested the District Court of jurisdiction over pleadings unrelated to the issue of possession, and we find none. 
While the District Court retained jurisdiction "over 
the remainder of the case," it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to further adjudicate the Judgment for Possession or to review any request for attorneys' fees incurred to obtain possession of the Property until Case No. CAAP-12-0000541 was resolved on August 31, 2015, when the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
denied the Parkinson's application for a writ of certiorari from 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
this court's judgment on appeal, which had affirmed the Judgment 
for Possession. See CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., 95 Hawai 'i 
301, 307-08, 22 P.3d 97, 103-04 (App. 2001) (if a motion for attorneys' fees or costs is filed more than 10 days after entry of judgment and is not decided before a valid notice of appeal is timely filed, the circuit court lacks jurisdiction to decide the motion while the appeal is pending); French v. French, 110 Hawai
'i 399, 404, 133 P.3d 828, 833 (App. 2006) (concluding that 
the lower court was divested of jurisdiction to decide a motion for attorneys' fees/costs after the notice of appeal was filed). Therefore, the District Court erred to the extent that it prematurely awarded attorneys' fees related to the issue of possession in the October 12, 2012 Judgment and related garnishment orders, and prematurely awarded attorneys' fees related to the issue of possession in the June 4, 2014 Amended Judgment. 
Because the District Court subsequently set aside the
 
October 12, 2012 Judgment on December 2, 2013, and struck
 Mosier's declaration with instructions to submit a revised
 declaration for fees and costs on March 20, 2014, however, any
 error associated with the October 12, 2012 fees award and related
 garnishee summons was corrected as a matter of course. See Haw.
 
R. Civ. P. 61 (a judgment or order is not to be disturbed absent
 conflict with the substantial rights of the parties). We vacate,
 however, as to the fees awarded in the June 4, 2014 Amended
 Judgment and remand for further proceedings.
 
(3) The District Court did not err in granting Mosier's
 
MSJ because the Parkinsons failed to meet their burden to
 demonstrate any genuine issues of material fact. In the MSJ,
 Mosier claimed that she was entitled to damages in the amount of
 $3,850, representing unpaid rent for June 2012. Mosier explained
 that the lease term extended through July 7, 2012; that the
 Parkinsons did not make a June 2012 rental payment; and that she
 had applied the Parkinson's $3,850 security deposit toward the
 Parkinsons' outstanding February 2012 rental payment. As
 support, Mosier cited to provisions in the rental agreement, as
 well as Findings of Fact ("FOFs") 6 and 7 in the District Court's
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
June 18, 2012 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
 
Granting Entry of Judgment for Possession and Issuance of Writ of
 Possession Effective June 1, 2012" ("FOF/COL/Order for
 Possession").
5/ In opposition, the Parkinsons did not contest
 
those FOFs or that they failed to make a rental payment for
 February or June 2012, and they did not claim an entitlement to
 withhold the rental payments. Rather, they reiterated their
 argument that Mosier breached the purported purchase agreement,
 an argument that the District Court had already found lacked
 merit in its FOF/COL/Order for Possession. To the extent that
 the Parkinsons thereby reargue the issues already addressed in
 our earlier determination in Case No. CAAP-12-0000541, that case,
 as noted earlier, cannot be relitigated. Therefore, the
 Parkinsons have not identified any genuine issues of material
 fact left to resolve, and the District Court, therefore, did not
 err.
 
With regard to the Parkinsons' Counterclaim No. 2,
 
under HRS § 521-64, for reimbursement of repair costs, Mosier
 argued that the Parkinsons presented no evidence of a health or
 safety violation or defect in material noncompliance on the
 premises, or that Mosier, as a result of a wrongful act, was
 improperly benefitted by the repairs the Parkinsons made. To
 support these arguments, Mosier cited to the FOF/COL/Order for
 Possession, in which the District Court found that the premises
 were habitable when the Parkinsons signed the rental agreement
 and took possession, the Parkinsons were compensated for certain
 repairs they made, and the Parkinsons had agreed to maintain the
 pool and yard. 
As the District Court found, and the Parkinsons have
 
not contested, the Parkinsons deducted from their rental payments
 the amounts they spent to repair certain plumbing and sewer
 
5/
 FOFs 6 and 7 provide:
 
6. [The Parkinsons] paid rent to [Mosier] for July,
August, September, October, November, and December of 2011
as well as January 2012.
 
7. [The Parkinsons] failed to pay rent for February
2012.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
problems, and the Parkinsons were responsible under the rental
 
agreement for pool and yard repair. The Parkinsons did not
 notify Mosier of other alleged defects on the Property, including
 the pest and termite problems, as required by the rental
 agreement. See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 521-64(c) (2006) (requiring a
 
tenant to give his or her landlord notice of and the opportunity
 to cure any alleged defects in material non-compliance with
 
6/
§ 521-42(a) ).
Regarding the Parkinsons' alternative unjust-enrichment
 
claim in Counterclaim No. 2, the District Court found no
 wrongdoing on Mosier's behalf, that any alleged defects to the
 pool and yard and Mosier's failure to address them did not
 constitute a breach by Mosier of her duty to repair or provide
 habitable premises, and that the parties did not have a purchase
 agreement with each other. The latter two findings mirror those
 already determined by the District Court and affirmed by this
 court in Case No. 12-0000541. In opposition to the MSJ, the
 Parkinsons did not dispute these findings; rather, they repeated
 their allegation that the parties had entered into a purchase
 agreement, which they claim Mosier breached by failing to credit
 toward the Property's purchase price the amounts that the
 Parkinsons paid to make repairs to the Property. That issue, of
 course, is not subject to relitigation.
 
As to the Parkinsons' Counterclaim No. 4, that Mosier
 
took more than the allowable security deposit under the pretext
 of an "option agreement," in violation of HRS § 521-44, Mosier
 contended that $2,600 paid by the Parkinsons, which the
 Parkinsons asserted was an "additional security deposit," was
 actually consideration for a "right of first refusal." Mosier
 argued that because the Parkinsons signed the receipt indicating
 that the $2,600 was a purchase option, they clearly knew the
 amount did not represent an additional security deposit, as they
 
6/
 HRS § 521-42 provides, in relevant part that "[t]he landlord shall
at all times during the tenancy . . . [m]ake all repairs and arrangements
necessary to put and keep the premises in a habitable condition[.]" Haw. Rev.
 Stat. § 521-42(a)(3) (2006).

later claimed. Mosier cited to FOF 47/ in the FOF/COL/Order for
 
Possession and the rental agreement to support this argument.

 
Since this court affirmed the FOF/COL/Order for 
Possession in Case No. CAAP-12-0000541, FOF 4 therein is binding 
and not subject to relitigation. 
Thus, in sum, the District 
Court did not err in granting Mosier's MSJ. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 
56(b), (c), & (e); Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai 'i 46, 56-57, 60-61, 
292 P.3d 1276, 1286-87, 1290-91 (2013). 
Therefore, the District Court of the First Circuit's
 
March 7, 2014 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 Judgment, Filed on January 10, 2014" is affirmed. The May 21,
 2014 "Court Order" partially granting Mosier's motion for
 attorneys' fees, and the June 4, 2014 "Amended Judgment" for
 attorneys' fees are vacated and remanded to the District Court
 for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
