 Murakami's point on appeal fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) as he fails, inter alia, to provide record
citations or to quote any challenged findings or conclusions of the DistrictCourt. "Such noncompliance offers sufficient grounds for the dismissal of theappeal." Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85, 979 P.2d
1107, 1111 (1999) (citing Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 228, 909
P.2d 553, 556 (1995)). "Nonetheless, inasmuch as 'this court has consistentlyadhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have theircases heard on the merits, where possible,' [Bettencourt] at 230, 909 P.2d at558 (citation and internal quotations omitted), we address the issues[Appellant] raises on the merits."

motion to compel discovery of certain Intoxilyzer maintenance and
 
calibration records.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Murakami's point of error as follows and affirm.
 
The District Court did not err by denying the Motion to 
Compel.
3 Discovery in non-felony criminal cases is governed by 
Rule 16(d) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). State 
v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304, 308, 788 P.2d 1281, 1284 (1990). Discovery
 may be permitted by the trial court upon a showing of materiality
 and if the request is reasonable but only to the extent
 authorized by HRPP Rule 16 in felony cases. Id. at 309, 788 P.2d
 
at 1284.
 
In Ames, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i held that the 
Intoxilyzer results and the calibration results for an Intoxilyzer may be discoverable in misdemeanor cases under HRPP Rule 16(d). See Ames, 71 Haw. at 311 & n.9, 788 P.2d at 1285 & 
n.9; see also State v. Lee, 120 Hawai
'i 256, 203 P.3d 676, 
No. 29017 2009 WL 641462 at *1 (App. Mar. 13, 2009) (SDO). However, the Ames court limited discoverable documents to the results directly linked to the defendant, such as the defendant's particular test results and on the "[d]ate of calibration or verification of accuracy." Id. By contrast, the Ames court 
specifically vacated the order of discovery of more maintenance and calibration results, such as 
16. A copy of all repair, calibration, and maintenance
records and memoranda (including the permanent record book
and repair invoices) for the Intoxilyzer 4011AS used in this
case for the 30 days preceding and 30 days subsequent to the
date of the Defendant's test; and the original records for
the life of the Intoxilyzer 4011AS used in this case to be
made available for inspection and photocopying by
Defendant's attorney. (Citation omitted).

 On appeal, Murakami argues that the records in question are
potentially exculpatory and are therefore required disclosures on due processgrounds under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). However, Murakami didnot assert a due process violation in support of his September 18, 2012 motionto compel. Therefore this argument is deemed waived. Enoka v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co., 109 Hawai' i 537, 546, 128 P.3d 850, 859 (2006) (Generally, "failure
to raise or properly reserve issues at the trial level would be deemedwaived.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).

18. The method of calibration which was utilized for
 
the Intoxilyzer 4011AS used in this case. (Citation
omitted).
 
Ames, 71 Haw. at 315, 788 P.2d at 1287 (emphasis added).
 
More recently, this court has ruled that discoverable 
calibration records are limited to records made in close 
proximity to the date that the device was used to cite the defendant. See, e.g., State v. Elizares, 136 Hawai
'i 28, 356 
P.3d 1048, CAAP-14-0000498 2015 WL 5691390 at *1 (App. Sept. 28, 2015) (SDO) (cert. denied) (heard by the District Court with the instant case), State v. Eid, 127 Hawai
'i 3, 274 P.3d 1247, 
No. 29587 2012 WL 1071499 at *2 (App. Mar. 30, 2012) (SDO) (where defendant sought, inter alia, maintenance records of any device used to calibrate a police car speedometer for one year prior to his alleged offense, "Eid did not make a prima facie showing that the speed check evidence or speedometer reading were unreliable, and any claim on his part that the requested discovery would tend to negate his guilt or was material to his defense was speculative."); Lee, 120 Hawai
'i 256, 203 P.3d 676, No. 29017 
2009 WL 641462 at *3 ("If the laser gun is functioning properly on the date of the alleged offense, the age and date of purchase of the laser gun do not appear to be material to the defense. See HRPP Rule 16(d)."). 
Murakami also argues that the continuous length of
 
service of Intoxilyzer 68-011667 is itself suspect because such
 machines are allegedly unreliable. Murakami "specifically
 alleg[es] that the Intoxilizer [sic] [68-011667] was improperly
 maintained and therefore cannot be relied upon as a competent
 source of information[.]" Murakami provides no legal authority
 to support his proposition of general unreliability and does not
 proffer evidence of alleged impropriety, but rather speculates
 that the calibration records of Intoxilyzer 68-011667 dating back
 to 2008 -- when Intoxilyzer 68-011667 began its uninterrupted
 service -- will provide insight into inevitable mistakes in its
 maintenance and calibration because (1) ever since "[Officer
 Nacis] signed off as the supervisor, and ever since he took over
 there has been no malfunction"; and (2) the expert testimony of

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Dr. Michaud indicates that verifying the accuracy of Intoxilyzer
 
68-011667 is not possible without certain information.
 
Murakami's argument is without merit. As his counsel
 
acknowledged before the District Court, defendants are routinely
 provided with (1) the maintenance and calibration records taken
 thirty days before and after the breath test in question; and
 (2) the actual results of Murakami's breath test. As explained in Eid, without a prima facie showing that the measuring instrument was otherwise unreliable, any claim that the requested discovery would tend to negate his guilt or was material to his defense is speculative. As explained in 
Lee, if the measuring 
instrument is functioning properly on the date of the alleged offense, then the historical calibration and maintenance records are not material to the defense. Lee, 120 Hawai
'i 256, 203 P.3d 
676, No. 29017 2009 WL 641462. 
Therefore, the March 5, 2014 Notice of Entry of

 
Judgment and/or Order entered by the District Court of the Third
 Circuit, North and South Hilo Division is affirmed.
