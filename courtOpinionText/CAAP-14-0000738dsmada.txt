STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHARLES LEE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5DCW-13-0000125)

 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Charles Lee's
 
(Appellant Lee's) appeal from the District Court of the Fifth
 
Circuit's (district court's) Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry
 of Judgment/Order, filed on October 24, 2013, and Judgment/Order
 
and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order, filed on March 14, 2014,
 because they do not qualify as final, appealable judgments under

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-12 (Supp. 2013),  Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(3), and the holding
 
in State v. Bohannon, 102 Hawai 'i 228, 236, 74 P.3d 980, 988 
(2003). Both judgments lack (1) a sentence, as State v. Kilborn,
 
109 Hawai 'i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 2005), requires; and 
(2) a signature of the district court judge or clerk, as Hawai 'i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 32(c)(2) requires.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). "Appeals from the district court, in
 criminal cases, are authorized by HRS § 641-12, which . . .
 provides in pertinent part that appeals upon the record shall be
 allowed from all final decisions and final judgments of district
 courts in all criminal matters." Ontiveros, 82 Hawai
'i at 449, 
923 P.2d at 391 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
HRPP Rule 32(c)(2) expressly requires the following:
 
A judgment of conviction in the district court shall set
forth the disposition of the proceedings and the same shall
be entered on the record of the court. The filing of the
written judgment, or in the event of oral judgment, the
filing of the written notice of entry of judgment, in the

 HRS § 641-12 provides:
Appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all
final decisions and final judgments of district courts in
all criminal matters. Such appeals may be made to the
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602
whenever the party appealing shall file notice of the
party's appeal within thirty days, or such other time as may
be provided by the rules of the court.
Within a reasonable time after an appeal has been
perfected from a decision of a district court to the
appellate court in a criminal matter, it shall be incumbent
upon the district court to make a return thereof, together
with all papers and exhibits filed in such case.
It shall be the duty of the clerk of the supreme to
transmit within a reasonable time to the district court from
 whose decision the appeal was made, a statement showing the
disposition of the case.
(Emphasis added.)
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
office of the clerk constitutes entry of judgment. The
 
judgment or notice of entry shall be signed by the judge or
by the clerk, if the judge so directs.
 
Furthermore, "[a] judgment or order is entered within the meaning
 
of this subsection when it is filed with the clerk of the court." 
HRAP Rule 4(b)(3). 
Based on HRPP Rule 32(c)(2) and HRAP Rule 4(b)(3), the 
Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that, "in order to appeal a 
criminal matter in the district court, the appealing party must appeal from a written judgment or order that has been filed with the clerk of the court pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3)." Bohannon, 
102 Hawai
'i at 236, 74 P.3d at 988. Furthermore, we have held 
that when district courts find defendants guilty of any charged crime, those "[j]udgments of conviction are not final unless they include the final adjudication and the final sentence." Kilborn, 
109 Hawai
'i at 442, 127 P.3d at 102. 
Therefore, in order to be final and appealable under
 
HRS § 641-12, a district court judgment must reflect the court's
 final decision by satisfying four requirements. It must
 
(1) be a written judgment or order that has been filed
with the clerk of the court pursuant to
HRAP Rule 4(b)(3), as the holding in Bohannon
requires;
 
(2) contain the district court's disposition of the
charged crimes, as HRPP Rule 32(c)(2) requires;
 
(3) contain the signature of either the district court
judge or clerk, as HRPP Rule 32(c)(2) requires;
and
 
(4) contain the final sentence, if the district court
has found the defendant guilty, as the holding in
Kilborn requires.
 
In the instant case, the October 24, 2013 Judgment and
 
the March 14, 2014 Judgment appear to satisfy the first
 
-3­  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirement because they are in writing and were filed with the
 
district court clerk pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b)(3). Further, the
 October 24, 2013 Judgment satisfies the second requirement for a
 district court judgment because it contains the district court's
 finding of guilt as to the charge of Assault in the Third Degree.
 
However, neither the October 24, 2013 Judgment nor the
 
March 14, 2014 Judgment satisfies the third and fourth
 requirements because neither judgment contains the signature of
 the district court judge or clerk and neither judgment contains 
a final sentence.

Therefore, neither the October 24, 2013 Judgment nor
 
the March 14, 2014 Judgment is a final, appealable judgment under
 HRS § 641-12. Absent a final, appealable judgment under HRS
 § 641-12, we cannot exercise appellate jurisdiction over
 appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000738, and Appellant Lee's
 appeal is premature.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original
action. Appellate courts, upon determining that they
lack jurisdiction shall not require anything other
than a dismissal of the appeal or action. Without
jurisdiction, a court is not in a position to consider
the case further. 
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure
that they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case.
The lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived
by any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

apparently related to sentencing, but with numerous items crossed out. Any
attempt to indicate the sentence cannot be deciphered.
