APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-2746-12)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ. )

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by Plaintiffs-Counterclaim
 
Defendants-Appellants Gaivin Alao and Gemma Abella Alao
 (Appellants). 
On December 28, 2010, Appellants filed a Complaint for
 
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, for Rescission and for Damages
 against Defendant-Counterclaimant-Appellee OneWest Bank, FSB
 (Onewest) and Defendant-Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration
 Systems (MERS) (collectively Appellees).
 
On May 25, 2011, Appellants filed a First Amended
 
Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, for Rescission
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and for Damages against Appellees. Appellants requested
 
Declaratory Relief for violation of HRS Chapter 480 (Count I),
 Damages for Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices for violation
 of HRS Chapter 480 (Count II), Declaratory Relief and Damages for
 Illegal and Fraudulent Assignment of their mortgage (Count III),
 TILA Cancellation and Rescission (Count IV), Declaratory Judgment
 for title (Count V), and Punitive Damages (Count VI). 
On November 20, 2011, Appellees filed an Answer to the
 
First Amended Complaint and Onewest filed a Counterclaim against
 Appellants for (1) Ratification of Non-Judicial Foreclosure and
 (2) Writ of Possession for the Property.
 
On April 15, 2012, Appellees filed a Motion for Summary
 
Judgment Re: First Amended Complaint and Onewest Bank, FSB's
 Counterclaim for (1) Ratification of Non-Judicial Foreclosure and
 (2) Writ of Ejectment/Possession. Appellees requested summary
 judgment in their favor on all of Appellants' claims and summary
 judgment in favor of Onewest on all of Onewest's counterclaims.
 
Also on April 15, 2012, Appellees filed a Motion to
 
Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices from Representing Plaintiffs. 
Appellees alleged that an attorney with Dubin Law Offices
 previously represented Onewest, thus, there was a conflict of
 interest that disqualified the entire firm from representing
 Appellants. 
On October 5, 2012, the circuit court issued a
 
Memorandum Opinion on Motion to Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices
 from Representation of Plaintiffs and Order. The circuit court
 granted Appellees' Motion to Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices
 from Representing Plaintiffs.
 
On November 5, 2012, the circuit court denied
 
"Plaintiff's (1) Motion for a Stay Renewing Request for an
 Evidentiary Hearing Concerning the Disqualification of the Dubin
 Law Offices from the Representation of Plaintiffs, or in the
 Alternative (2) Motion for a Stay Reserving Question of the
 Disqualification to the Hawaii Supreme Court pursuant to HRAP
 Rule 15, or in the Alternative (3) Motion for Stay Pending Appeal
 to the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals and/or Pending
 Emergency Petition to the Hawaii Supreme Court."

On July 7, 2013, Appellants filed a "Rule 54(b) 
Revision Motion to Set Aside the October 5, 2012 'Memorandum 
Opinion on Motion to Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices from representation of Plaintiff and Order' Based on Mistake and/or Fraud upon the Court and for Sanctions" (Motion to Set Aside). Appellants requested, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b) and 60(b), that the circuit court change its decision regarding the disqualification of the Dubin Law Offices. 
On August 30, 2013, the circuit court issued an Order
 
Granting Defendants Onewest Bank, FSB's and Mortgage Electronic
 Registration Systems, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment Filed
 March 15, 2012. 
On September 11, 2013, a Judgment was entered in favor
 
of Appellees and against Appellants on all of Appellants' claims
 in the First Amended Complaint and in favor of Onewest and
 against Appellants on all counterclaims by Onewest. 
On March 3, 2014, the circuit court issued an "Order
 
Denying Plaintiffs and Counterclaim Defendants Gaivin Alao and
 Gemma Abella Alao's Rule 54(b) Revision Motion to Set Aside the
 October 5, 2012 'Memorandum Opinion on Motion to Disqualify the
 Dubin Law Offices from Representation of Plaintiffs and Order'
 Based on Mistake and/or Fraud upon the Court and for Sanctions,
 Filed on July 3, 2013" (Order Denying Motion to Set Aside).
 
On April 2, 2014, Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal. 
Appellants appeal from (1) the Memorandum Opinion on Motion to
 Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices from Representation of
 Plaintiffs and Order, filed on October 5, 2012, (2) the Order
 Granting Defendants Onewest, FSB's and Mortgage Electronic
 Registration Systems, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment Filed
 March 15, 2012, filed on August 30, 2013, (3) the Judgment, filed
 on September 11, 2013, and (4) the Order Denying Motion to Set
 Aside. 
HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2013) authorizes appeals from
 
"final judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a). 
Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . .
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c) (Supp.
 
2013).
 
Rule 58 of the HRCP requires that "[e]very judgment 
shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "An 
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). Thus, the circuit court must enter a single judgment that resolves all claims in all cases that the circuit court has consolidated, unless the circuit court certifies the judgment (on less than all claims) for appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). 
The September 11, 2013 Judgment was a separate final
 
judgment entered in favor of Appellees and against Appellants on
 all claims in the First Amended Complaint and in favor of Onewest
 and against Appellants on all counterclaims by Onewest. Thus,
 the September 11, 2013 Judgment was an appealable final judgment
 under HRS § 641-1.
 
"[A]s a general rule, an appeal from a final judgment 
in a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." State v. Adam, 97 Hawai
'i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 
884 (2002) (citations omitted). As this court held in CAAP-12­0000982, the Memorandum Opinion on Motion to Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices from Representation of Plaintiff and Order, filed on October 5, 2012, was an interlocutory order. Therefore, the Memorandum Opinion on Motion to Disqualify the Dubin Law Offices from Representation of Plaintiffs and Order, filed on October 5, 2012 is appealable only if the final judgment was properly appealed. 
An order granting a motion for summary judgment is also
 
an interlocutory order. Bank of Honolulu v. Anderson, 3 Haw.
 
App. 545, 548, 654 P.2d 1370, 1373 (1982)(motions granting and
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denying the motions for summary judgment is not a "judgment" as
 
the word is used in HRCP Rule 54(a), 58, and 73(a)). Thus, the
 Order Granting Defendants OneWest, FSB's and Mortgage Electronic
 Registration Systems, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment Filed
 March 15, 2012, filed on August 30, 2013, is also appealable only
 if the final judgment was properly appealed.
 
Lastly, the Order Denying Motion to Set Aside is
 
appealable only if the final judgment was properly appealed. 
Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal on April 2, 2014. 
However, the Judgment was filed on September 11, 2013. Thus, the
 Notice of Appeal was filed more than 30 days after the entry of
 the Judgment. 
Appellants attempt to rely upon the March 3, 2014
 
denial of their Motion to Set Aside to extend the time to file a
 notice of appeal. 
"If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a
 
matter of law, to amended findings or make additional findings,
 for a new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
 order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing the
 notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an
 order disposing of the motion[.]" HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
"HRCP Rule 54(b) is applicable to the reconsideration 
of a pre-judgment interlocutory order, because HRCP Rule 54(b) provides that an order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties." Stop Rail Now v. De Costa, 120 Hawai
'i 238, 245, 203 
P.3d 658, 665 (App. 2008). However, "The tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) applies to a motion to reconsider a "judgment," not an interlocutory order." Id. Thus, the Motion to Set Aside 
was not a tolling motion and could not extend the time to file a notice of appeal. 
Appellants also cited HRCP Rule 60(b) as authority for
 
the Motion to Set Aside. However, "Rule 60(b) only applies to a
 "final judgment, order, or proceeding. . . This court has defined
 "final order" to mean "an order ending the proceedings, leaving
 nothing further to be accomplished. Consequently, an order is
 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined 
or if the matter is retained for further action." Cho v. State, 
115 Hawai 'i 373, 382-83, 168 P.3d 17, 26-27 (2007). Motions for 
reconsideration of an interlocutory order cannot be properly characterized as a motion under HRCP Rule 60(b). Id. at 383, 168 
P.3d at 27 (citing Peterson v. Lindher, 765 F.2d 698, 704 (7
th 
Cir. 1985)(motions for reconsideration of interlocutory order cannot be properly characterized as a motion under FRCP Rule 60(b)). Therefore, relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b) was not available. Id. (HRCP Rule 60(b) relief not available for motion 
for reconsideration of interlocutory sanction order). 
Absent a tolling of the time to file a notice of
 
appeal, a notice of appeal must have been filed within 30 days
 after entry of the September 11, 2013 Judgment. The Notice of
 Appeal was not filed until April 2, 2014. Therefore, the appeal
 was untimely. HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely
 notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
 that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot
 disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v.
 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule
 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change
 the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the
 HRAP]."). 
For these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this
 
appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
