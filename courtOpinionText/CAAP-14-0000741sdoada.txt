OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JANE DOE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
JOHN DOE, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 09-1-1674)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
This appeal arises from a divorce between Plaintiff-
Appellant Jane Doe ("Mother") and Defendant-Appellee John Doe
 
("Father") and a dispute over the custody of their minor child
 ("Child"). Specifically, this consolidated appeal arises out of
 a series of child custody orders that were issued by the Family
 Court of the First Circuit ("Family Court") following its
 Decision and Order of April 29, 2013, in which the Family Court
 awarded Father with sole-legal and joint-physical custody of the
 Child. 
Mother appeals from the January 28, 2014 "Order Denying
 
[Mother's] Motion for Post-Decree Relief, Filed on October 28,
 2013 and Order Modifying Child Support"; the March 6, 2014 "Order

Decree Relief and [Mother's] Supplemental Motion for Post-Decree
 Relief",

On appeal, in case No. CAAP-14-0000741, Mother asserts

 
that the Family Court erred when it denied: (1) her October 28,
 2013 Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief despite the
 fact that Mother met her burden of proving a material change of
 circumstances, and that a modification of legal and physical
 custody was in the best interest of the Child; and (2) her
 February 6, 2014 motion for reconsideration of the January 28,
 2014 order because Mother showed good cause for her motion. 
In case No. CAAP-14-0001307, Mother asserts that the
 
Family Court erred when it found that Mother failed: (3a) to meet
 her burden of demonstrating fraud, misrepresentation, or other
 misconduct; and (3b) to show that she was denied due process of
 law.
 
Finally, in case No. CAAP-15-0000525, Mother asserts
 
that the Family Court erred when it denied: (4) her December 1,
 2014 Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief despite the
 fact that Mother met her burden of proving a material change of
 circumstances, and that a modification of legal and physical
 custody was in the best interest of the Child; and (5) her
 May 22, 2015 motion for reconsideration of the May 13, 2015 order
 despite the fact that Mother showed good cause for her motion. 
The Family Court's decisions and the briefing in these 
appeals occurred before the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's recent 
decision in Waldecker v. O'Scanlon, ___ P.3d ___, No. SCWC-14­0000780, 2016 WL 3364695 (Hawai
'i June 17, 2016). In Waldecker, 
the supreme court overturned case law which had required a person seeking a change in custody to satisfy two conditions: (a) that

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
there had been a material change in circumstances since the
 
previous custody order; and (2) that the requested change of
 custody was in the best interest of the child. The supreme court
 held that a material change in circumstances is not required
 "before the court can consider the best interests of the child in
 modifying a custody order. Rather than that two-step analysis,
 
there is a single inquiry which focuses on the best interests of
 the child." Id. at *11 (emphasis added).
 
In this case, the Family Court denied Mother's requests
 
for modification of the existing child custody order based on its
 dual determinations that (1) Mother had not shown a material
 change in circumstances, and (2) a modification of custody was
 not in the best interests of the Child. In light of Waldecker,
 we do not address Mother's challenges to the Family Court's
 determinations that she failed to show a material change in
 circumstances. Rather we focus on Mother's challenges to the
 Family Court's determination that the modification of custody was
 not in the Child's best interests.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Mother's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) In her first point of error in case No. CAAP-14­
0000741, Mother contends that the Family Court erred when it held
 that a material change of circumstances had not occurred, and it
 was in the Child's best interest to remain primarily with Father.
 Mother argues that the Family Court should have considered the
 factors in Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 571-46(b) when it
 determined the Child's best interest, and that the Child's
 emotional and educational needs justified a change of custody in
 favor of Mother. Specifically, Mother asserts that she met her
 burden by demonstrating (a) that the Child was exhibiting
 "behavioral issues" at school, (b) the "questionable safety of
 [Father's] vehicle and/or the status of [Father's] driver's
 license and traffic record," and (c) the fact that she was no
 longer employed. These arguments are without merit. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Contrary to Mother's contentions, the Family Court did 
not err when it explicitly found in its June 12, 2014 Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order that "based upon the credible and reliable evidence, a modification of legal and physical custody is not in the best interest of the child." Waldecker, 2016 WL 3364695, at *11 (holding that the question for the court to consider in addressing a request for a change in child custody is "whether or not there has been such a change of circumstances that the modification will be for the [best interest] of the child." (quoting Dela Cruz v. Dela Cruz, 35 Haw. 95, 98 (1939))). Moreover, Mother points to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Family Court did not consider HRS § 571-46(b) factors in coming to its conclusion that based on the evidence presented, a modification of legal and physical custody was not in the best interest of the Child, and we find none. Thus, we conclude that the Family Court considered HRS § 571-46(b) factors and did not abuse its discretion. Cf. In re 
Doe, 101 Hawai
'i 220, 232, 65 P.3d 167, 179 (2003) (citing In re 
Doe Children, 96 Hawai 'i 272, 286, 30 P.3d 878, 892 (2001)) 
(explaining that the appellate courts "give[] deference to decisions of the family court to issue orders that are in the best interests of a child"). 
(1)(a) Mother contends that Child's behavior at pre­
school and elementary school after Father gained sole-legal and
 joint-physical custody of the Child constituted a material change
 in circumstance. Mother's argument is misplaced in light of
 Waldecker. Furthermore, the Family Court did not abuse its
 discretion in concluding that the school behavioral issues did
 not demonstrate that modification in custody was in the best
 interest of the Child.
 
Notably, the first "incident" at pre-school was not a
 
behavioral incident, but a health related one as it involved the
 Child getting her finger stuck in a guinea pig cage.
 Additionally, the only indicia that the other two incidents at
 pre-school had anything to do with Father's custody or the amount
 of time Child spent with Mother was provided by Mother in her
 written response to the incident. Similarly, the incidents at
 elementary school did not indicate that modification would be in
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the best interest of the child. Mother failed to include any
 
reports of those incidents in her October 28, 2013 Motion and
 Declaration for Post-Decree Relief, and Father related that many
 of the Child's classmates were also struggling to adjust to the
 daily schedule, which did not include nap time, and that changes
 that were improving the children's behavior had been implemented. 
Mother does not cite any authority in support of her
 
argument, and we find none. Therefore, the Family Court did not
 err in concluding that Mother did not demonstrate that there has
 been such a change in circumstances that modification would be in
 the best interest of the Child. Waldecker, 2016 WL 3364695, at
 
*11.
 
(1)(b) Mother contends that the Family Court erred
 
when it concluded that Mother "failed to substantiate her
 concerns regarding the safety of Father's vehicle and/or the
 status of his driver's license" and that those allegations did
 not constitute a material change in circumstance. Again,
 Mother's argument is misplaced in light of Waldecker, and,
 furthermore, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in
 concluding that these issues did not demonstrate that
 modification in custody was in the best interest of the Child. 
Although we do not consider the transcript of the
 
4/
January 8, 2014 hearing,  the record shows that Mother provided
a printout of Father's traffic case regarding a citation for

 
driving without a license in her October 28, 2013 Motion and
 Declaration for Post-Decree Relief. While Father may have been
 cited for driving without a license, that fact alone does not
 demonstrate that Father's car is unsafe, that Father is an unsafe
 
4/
 Mother attached the transcript for the January 8, 2014 hearing to
her opening brief, but failed to include the transcript in the record on
appeal. "[T]he burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error byreference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of
providing an adequate transcript." In re RGB, 123 Hawai' i 1, 27, 229 P.3d
1006, 1092 (2010) (quoting Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230,
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995)). When an appellant attaches a transcript to the
opening brief and fails to include it in the record on appeal, we disregard
the transcript, as it is not part of the record. See Haw. R. App. P.
28(b)(10) ("Anything that is not part of the record shall not be appended to
the brief, except as provided in this rule."). However, this court may stillconsider the appeal if "it is possible to determine that the [Family C]ourt
erred without recourse to the transcript." Thomas-Yukimura v. Yukimura, 130
Hawai'i 1, 10 n.19, 304 P.3d 1182, 1191 n.19 (2013). Thus, we proceed to
review the appeal on the merits, to the extent possible.

driver, or that Child was in danger when Father drove. Cf. J.F.
 
v. J.F., No. CAAP-12-0000793, 2014 WL 4167013, at *2 (Hawai 'i 
App. Aug. 22, 2014) (holding that a material change of 
circumstances existed when, among other things, custodial parent was stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol when child was in the vehicle). Father provided a copy of his vehicle registration at the January 8, 2014 hearing, and the record indicates that Father's case for driving without a license was dismissed with prejudice. Thus, the Family Court did not err in finding that Mother failed to substantiate her allegations that Father's driving violations demonstrated that a modification in custody would be in the best interest of the Child. Waldecker, 
2016 WL 3364695, at *11. 
(1)(c) Mother argues that she demonstrated a material

 
change in circumstance by being unemployed, and by declaring that
 she was able to spend more time with the Child. Mother's
 argument is misplaced in light of Waldecker, and, furthermore,
 the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that
 a modification in custody was not in the best interest of the
 Child.
 
Again, Mother does not cite to any authority supporting
 
her position, and we can find none. Moreover, Father argued that
 Mother has high potential to earn income, and the Family Court
 agreed that Mother's unemployment did not warrant a change in
 custody. Thus, the Family Court did not err in concluding that a
 modification of custody was not in the Child's best interest. 
(2) In her second point of error in case No. CAAP-14­
0000741, Mother asserts that she met her burden of proof and showed good cause in her February 6, 2014 motion for reconsideration, in which she asked the court to reconsider its January 28, 2014 order denying the October 28, 2013 Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief. Although this contention appears at the beginning of the opening brief's argument section, Mother fails to argue this point further. Thus, it is deemed waived. See Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be 
deemed waived."); Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i 126, 144 
n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai
'i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
explaining that "this court may 'disregard a particular
 
contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in
 support of that position'"). Moreover, even if Mother had
 sufficiently argued her point, this point of error lacks merit.
 
In her February 6, 2014 motion, Mother merely 
reiterated her arguments from her October 28, 2013 Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief. As such, because Mother did not present new arguments or provide new evidence, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying her February 6, 2014 motion for reconsideration. See, e.g., Child Support Enf't 
Agency v. Doe, 104 Hawai
'i 449, 459, 91 P.3d 1092, 1102 (App. 
2004) (affirming family court's denial of motion for reconsideration where the movant's only arguments had already been presented at the previous hearing and the movant failed to raise new evidence that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motions). 
(3) In her first and second points of error in case No. 
CAAP-14-0001307, Mother contends that the Family Court erred in denying her May 5, 2014 Hawai
'i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") Rule 
60(b) motion for relief from the Decision and Order when it found (a) that Mother failed to meet her burden of demonstrating fraud,
 misrepresentation, or other misconduct; and (b) that Mother
 failed to show that she was denied due process of law. We
 discuss Mother's arguments in turn.
 
(3)(a) Mother argues that Father's attorney, Marianita

 
Lopez, "made several deeply concerning misrepresentations to
 procure a favorable judgment for her client[,]" and that Lopez
 lied to the Family Court when she wrote in her May 2 and May 4,
 2012 letters that there were no open spots for Child at Ka Hana
 Pono Daycare. Mother contends that Lopez's alleged conduct
 "clearly rises to the level of misrepresentation, if not fraud,
 under HRCP and HFCR Rule 60(b)(3)." We disagree. 
In reviewing an HFCR Rule 60(b) motion,
 
the movant must, (1) prove by clear and convincing evidence
that the verdict was obtained through fraud,
misrepresentation, or other misconduct, and (2) establish
that the conduct complained of prevented the losing party
from fully and fairly presenting his case or defense.

United Agri. Prods., 86 Hawai 'i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 
(1997)) (brackets omitted). 
Here, Mother did not prove that the Decision & Order 
was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, or other 
misconduct, nor did she establish that the conduct complained of prevented her from fully and fairly presenting her case or defense.
5/ Lopez's statements in the May 2 and May 4, 2012 
letters were not false or misleading. Thus, Mother did not establish that the Decision and Order was the result of misrepresentation, and the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mother's HFCR Rule 60(b) motion. See 
Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i 128, 145, 254 P.3d 439, 
456 (2011) (holding that the moving party's "allegation of nondisclosure by an adverse party," could not support the movant's HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) motion (citing Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai
'i 408, 431, 32 P.3d 52, 75 
(2001))). 
(3)(b) We also disagree with Mother's contention that
 
she demonstrated in her HFCR Rule 60(b) motion that the Court
 deprived her of her constitutional right to due process of law by
 limiting her to presenting a single witness in her defense of the
 allegations in Father's February 8, 2012 motion for post-decree
 relief. In support, Mother cites to Troxel v. Granville, 530
 U.S. 57, 66 (2000), in which the Supreme Court of the United
 States discussed the fundamental due process rights of parents to
 make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their
 
5/
 The documents attached to Mother's HFCR Rule 60(b) motion for
relief included a June 14, 2013 letter, wherein Angelica Friedmann, the
director of Ka Hana Pono Daycare, stated that "[t]he fact that I have known
Mrs. Lopez as a custody evaluator should not be misinterpreted to mean that
Mrs. Lopez misrepresented herself when I spoke to her on May 2nd about
[Child,]" and that her references to Lopez as a custody evaluator "would be
the same as Mrs Lopez calling me a childcare provider and not the Director of
the childcare center." The letter also explained that Father was told in late
April 2012 that there were no openings for enrollment at Ka Hana Pono Daycare,
and that Mother was also informed that there were no openings; however, the
daycare created a spot for Child after speaking at length with Mother.
Nonetheless, Friedmann wrote that Ka Hana Pono disenrolled Child when it
discovered that Child's enrollment was based on a misunderstanding that both
parties had agreed to the enrollment, and that Mother had, in fact,
unilaterally enrolled Child in violation of a court order requiring the
parties to agree on a preschool prior to enrolling the Child.

children. She also claims that she offered evidence of a Hawaii
 
Department of Human Services investigation that would have been
 presented had she been given the opportunity to be heard in a
 meaningful manner. We find these arguments to be unpersuasive.
 
Although Mother argues that her due process rights were
 
violated when she was only allowed to have one witness, she has
 failed to demonstrate that she ever requested to present
 additional witnesses. At the hearing on the HCFR Rule 60(b)
 motion, for example, the court explained the procedures Mother
 could have followed to request additional witnesses and asked if
 Mother could point to a place in the record demonstrating that
 she did so, but Mother could not.
6/
 
Furthermore,"[t]he basic elements of procedural due
 
process of law require notice and an opportunity to be heard at a
 meaningful time and in a meaningful manner," yet Mother has not
 established that she was deprived of these opportunities.

 Mother failed to attach the complete transcripts from the
April 27, August 3, and November 30, 2012 hearings on the February 8, 2012
motion for post-decree relief to the HFCR Rule 60(b) motion itself, and theportions from the April and August 2012 transcripts that were included did notcontain evidence of any such request. On appeal, Mother also fails to includethe transcripts from the April 27, August 3, or November 30, 2012 hearings, orpoint to anywhere in the record where she requested additional witnesses or
was refused by the court. See generally Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & 
Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 114 n.23, 176 P.3d 91, 113 n.23 (2008) ("This court is
not obligated to sift through the voluminous record to verify an appellant'sinadequately documented contentions." (quoting In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai' i 211, 234–35, 151 P.3d 692, 715–16 (2007) (internal
quotation marks and brackets omitted))). 
Moreover, the minutes from those proceedings support the Family
Court's findings, which we will not overturn in the absence of clear error. In re Doe, 95 Hawai' i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) (explaining that a family
court's findings of fact on appeal are clearly erroneous only if there is no
"credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value toenable a person of reasonable caution to support" the finding (citations
omitted)). Therefore, her argument fails. See Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. 
Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151-52, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984) ("An appellant
must include in the record all of the evidence on which the lower court mighthave based its findings and if this is not done, the lower court must be

Kunimoto, 91 Hawai 'i 372, 388, 984 P.2d 1198, 1214 (1999))). 
Indeed, the Family Court found that the hearing on Father's 
February 8, 2012 motion for post-decree relief was put on the short trial calendar because Father wanted the proceeding to be expedited and Mother was planning on relocating to California. See AC v. AC, 134 Hawai
'i 221, 229, 339 P.3d 719, 727 (2014) 
(stating that "adherence to a time schedule must be tempered by the circumstances of the proceeding as it unfolds, since such circumstances cannot always be accurately predicted ahead of time," and that "[a] trial court has discretion to set reasonable time limits for trial" (quoting and citing Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai
'i 
144, 155, 156, 44 P.3d 1085, 1096, 1097 (2002))).  And with 
regard to Mother's argument that she offered evidence of a Hawaii 
Department of Human Services investigation, Mother does not specify when the offer occurred, where in the record the alleged evidence was offered, or how the court failed to review such evidence in making its Decision & Order. Accordingly, we deem Mother's argument waived. See Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7); Asato v. 
Procurement Policy Bd., 132 Hawai
'i 333, 354 n.22, 322 P.3d 228, 
249 n.22 (2014) ("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal[.]" (quoting State v. Moses, 102 Hawai
'i 449, 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003))). 
Therefore, the Family Court did not clearly err in
 
finding and concluding that Mother did not demonstrate fraud or a
 violation of due process, and did not abuse its discretion in
 denying Mother's HFCR Rule 60(b) motion. 
(4) In her first point of error in case No. CAAP-15­
0000525, Mother argues that the Family Court erred in concluding
 that she failed to show a material change in circumstance. 
Specifically, Mother contends that she met her burden by
 demonstrating three material changes: (a) "Father's DUI arrest
 and charges"; (b) "Father's lack of responsible care for the
 Child's safety in driving without a valid driver's license with
 the Child in the car"; and (c) Father's "gross abuse of process
 . . . to the detriment of the Child's emotional and physical
 wellbeing [sic] as well as the Child's relationship with Mother." 
As above, Mother's argument is misplaced in light of
 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Waldecker. Contrary to Mother's contentions, the Family Court
 
did not err when it found and concluded in its August 4, 2015
 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that Mother failed to
 show that the change of custody she sought in her motion was in
 the best interest of her child. Waldecker, 2016 WL 3364695, at
 
*11.
 
(4)(a) Mother contends that she has provided "an
 
abundance of evidence of Father's yet-unchecked substance abuse
 issues," which includes a DUI charge that occurred after Father
 gained custody of the Child, and that the court erred in finding
 that "there was an insufficient basis to order Father to undergo
 a substance abuse assessment and treatment." In support, Mother
 cites to J.F., in which this court concluded that a change of
 custody was in the best interests of the child because in
 addition to mother being stopped for driving under the influence
 with the child in the car, testimony of a custody evaluator
 raised concerns over an uncle who recently moved in with mother
 and child, had significant problems, and allegedly sexually
 assaulted the child. 2014 WL 4167013, at *3. Mother also claims
 that it is likely that Child has been in the car at least once
 while Father was driving under the influence. We disagree with
 Mother's contention that the Family Court erred. 
Child was not in the car when Father was stopped for 
driving under the influence, and the record shows that Father's DUI arrest was dismissed without prejudice. Therefore, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was an insufficient basis to order Father to undergo a substance abuse assessment and treatment, In re Doe, 107 Hawai
'i at 19, 108 
P.3d at 973, and later concluding that the DUI citation did not show that the requested change of custody was in the best interests of the Child. Doe, 98 Hawai
'i at 153, 44 P.3d at 1094. 
(4)(b) Mother reiterates her argument from case No.
 
CAAP-14-000741, that the Family Court erred in concluding that
 Mother did not demonstrate a material change in circumstances
 given the evidence she provided on Father's history of driving
 without a license with Child in the car. Re-focusing on the
 issue of the Child's best interest, however, besides Father's DUI
 arrest, discussed above, the record does not reflect that Mother
 
11
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
provided any additional evidence of Father's unsafe driving since
 
she made the argument in case No. CAAP-14-000741. Thus, Mother
 fails to establish that Child's best interest required
 modification of custody and the court did not err.
 
(4)(c) Mother argues that Father's "repeated and 
significant abuse of process" is a significant change in circumstance that affects both the Child and the Mother-Child relationship. Mother also claims that Father abused his custodial rights when he refused to allow Child to engage in family therapy with Mother. Mother fails to cite to any authority supporting her position, and we find none. Moreover, in one of its unchallenged findings, the Family Court stated that Father "credibly" testified that on the recommendation of Catholic Charities, the Child was placed in play therapy with Kimberly Brewer, licensed therapist, once per week. See 
generally, In re Doe, 107 Hawai
'i at 19, 108 P.3d at 973. 
Accordingly, we hold that the Family Court did not err in finding and concluding that Mother did not demonstrate that the alleged abuse of process demonstrated that a modification of custody was in the best interest of the Child. 
(5) In her second point of error in case No. CAAP-15­
0000525, Mother presents another almost identical assertion to
 the one made in case No. CAAP-14-0000741. Here, she again
 asserts that she met her burden of proof and showed good cause in
 her May 22, 2015 motion for reconsideration, but fails to provide
 supporting argument for this point. As previously discussed, in
 the absence of a supporting argument, this point of error is
 waived. See Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7).
 
In her May 22, 2015 motion for reconsideration, Mother 
reiterated her arguments from the December 1, 2014 Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief, and attached exhibits which either could have been presented at an earlier hearing, or provided no support for her allegations. Accordingly, because Mother did not present new arguments or provide new evidence that could not have been presented at the time of the original proceeding, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the May 22, 2015 motion. See, e.g., Child Support Enf't 
Agency, 104 Hawai
'i at 459, 91 P.3d at 1102.
