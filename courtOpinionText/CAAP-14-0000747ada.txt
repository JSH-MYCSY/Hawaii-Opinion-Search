Yoneji (Neil), Successor Trustee of the Mitsuo Yoneji Revocable
 
Trust dated November 27, 1985 (Mitsuo Trust), and Neil and Claire
 
Yoneji (Claire), individually and as Trustees of the Yoneji
 
Revocable Family Trust Dated August 31, 1998 (Yoneji Family
Trust) (together, Yonejis) appeal from the (1) May 1, 2013 "Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant Mary Kazumi
 
Yoneji's Motion for Summary Judgment (Filed 2/26/13)" (MSJ
 
Order), and (2) the March 7, 2014 "Amended Final Judgment," filed

in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, the Yonejis argue the circuit court erred by
 
(1)
 granting-in-part the motion for summary judgment
 
(MSJ) of Defendant/Counterclaimant/Appellee Mary Yoneji (Mary);
 
(2) excluding several pieces of evidence and testimony
 
at trial;
 
(3) denying the Yonejis' request for a punitive damages
 
instruction; and
 
(4) denying several of the Yonejis' requests for costs.
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case involves the Mitsuo Trust, a family trust
 
funded by rental income generated from two income-producing
 
properties (together, Properties) originally owned by grantor,
 
Mitsuo Yoneji (Mitsuo). The trust left interests in the
 
Properties to Mitsuo's two sons, Neil and Owen Yoneji (Owen), and
 
any children Mitsuo's sons may have. Neil was married to Claire.
 
Owen was married to Defendant Charlene Yoneji (Charlene) and had
 
one child, Mary. Owen passed away before the start of the
 
Yonejis' lawsuit.
 
The Properties were co-owned by four family trusts in
 
varying amounts: the Mitsuo Trust, the Revocable Trust of Owen
 Kazuo Yoneji, dated January 11, 1994 (Owen Trust), the Revocable
 
Trust of Charlene Tsuruko Yoneji, dated January 11, 1994

 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Charlene Trust), and the Yoneji Family Trust. All profits and
 
expenses related to the Properties were handled through a single
 
trust bank account at the First Hawaiian Bank (FHB), which
 
operated under the Mitsuo Trust (Mitsuo Trust Account).
 
On October 26, 2009, the Yonejis filed a Complaint
 
alleging that Mary and Charlene improperly emptied the Mitsuo
 
Trust Account, and wrongfully redirected the rental income from
 the Properties co-owned by the various family trusts to Mary in
 her personal capacity. The Yonejis alleged that Mary was liable
 for conversion, constructive fraud, conspiracy, prima facie tort,
 unjust enrichment, and constructive trust. Specifically, the
 Yonejis alleged:
 
15. On April 11, 2008, [Mary] wrote a check drawn on
FHB Account No 30-069056 in the amount of $67,031.14 to
[FHB] which on the same day issued an Official Bank Check
payable in the same amount to [Charlene], Mary's mother.
The Official Bank Check indicated that [Mary] had purchased
same "for [Owen] & [Neil]."
 
16. [Neil] did not authorize the April 11, 2008
disbursement of funds from the Mitsuo Trust checking
account.
 
17. On April 28, 2008, [Mary] wrote a counter check
drawn on FHB Account No 30-069056 in the amount of
 $85,081.99 payable to [FHB] which on the same day, issued an
Official Bank Check payable in the same amount to [Owen].
The Official Bank Check indicated that [Mary] had purchased
the same for (or on behalf of) the Mitsuo Trust.
 
18. [Neil] did not authorize the April 28, 2008
disbursement of funds from the Mitsuo Trust checking
account.
 
19. After April 28, 2008, no further rent deposits
were made at any financial institution for the benefit of
the Mitsuo Trust. Mary collected in excess of Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) in rents from the tenants
occupying [Properties] individually, or on behalf of [Owen],
individually until [Owen] died in the Fall of 2008.
 
20. After Owen's death, [Mary] held herself out as the
individual owner of the [Properties], and instructed the
tenants of the [Properties] to make rent payments to her
individually, and received certain rent payments from
certain tenants, payable to her individually.
 
21. Moreover, [Mary] wrongfully failed and refused to
allow [Neil] access to either of the [Properties].
 
On December 22, 2009, Mary and Charlene filed their Answer.
 
On May 1, 2012, the circuit court approved a
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Stipulation for Appointment of Special Master" (Stipulation).
 
Both parties had stipulated to the use of a Special Master to
 
resolve the following issues:
 
1. With respect to the [Properties], an accounting of all
loans, sales, distributions, revenues, expenses, received,
spent, used and/or withdrawn by any one or more or the
Parties during the period March 1, 2008 to the present
("Subject Period"); and 
2. With respect to the management of the [Properties] for
the Subject Period, any discovered improprieties or
mismanagement (diversion or non-reporting of income,
improper expenses, improper distributions, withdrawals,
etc.) including without limitation, the dates, the parties
involved and the amount of any loss.
 
The Special Master was tasked with
 
1.	 [Conducting] an audit of the assets, revenues, and
expenses of the [Properties] from March 1, 2008 to
present.
 
2.	 [Determining] the interests of the co-owners of the
[Properties] and their past and present entitlement to
profits and responsibility for expenses.
 
3.	 [Determining] the final account among the co-owners,
taking into consideration all distributions and the
proceeds/credit from the sale of the [Properties].
 
4.	 [Determining] the parties' rights to the amounts
related to the [Properties] held, in custody and/or
control by any of the parties and the clerk of the
Court.
 
The parties stipulated: 
6. Upon completion of the investigation, the Special
Master shall circulate a proposed report, entertain comments
thereto, and make a final report to the [circuit court]
including findings and recommendations determining accounts
as set forth above. After filing of the final report, the
parties shall have an opportunity to object to any portion
of the report before the [circuit court] adopts findings and
issues a judgment. The [circuit court] shall determine any
whether there are any genuine issues of material fact to be
determined by the trier of fact.
 
All parties also agreed that "the trier of fact shall rely on the
 
report of the Special Master in determining the amounts, if any,
 owed by and between all parties in the above entitled action,
 subject to their determination of any disputed genuine issue of
 material fact (as set forth by the [circuit court])." The
 Stipulation provided that fees and costs associated with the
 Special Master would be distributed as follows:
 
4

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
10. The fees and costs associated with the appointment
of the Master shall be finally determined by agreement or by
Court Order, provided that any required advance for such
fess [sic] and cost shall be made (without prejudice) as
follows: 42.5% by [Yoneji Family Trust], 42.5% by [Owen
Trust and Charlene Trust] and 15% by the Mitsuo Trust. For
purposes of the Master's timekeeping, the Master shall keep
time for his or her analysis for matter from March 1, 2008
to August 15, 2009, separate from his or her analysis from
August 15, 2009, to the present.
 
On July 30, 2012, the circuit court issued its "Order
 
Setting Trial Date," ordering all exhibits to be delivered to the
 
circuit court and served by March 8, 2013.
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
 
On February 26, 2013, before the March 8, 2013 
deadline to deliver all exhibits to the circuit court, Mary filed
 
a motion for summary judgment (MSJ) on the Yonejis' conversion,
 
constructive fraud, conspiracy, prima facie tort, unjust
 
enrichment, and constructive trust claims. Mary also requested
 that the court grant summary judgment in her favor as to the
 claims brought in Neil and Claire's individual capacities,
 arguing that "they have no ownership interest to the Properties
 in their individual capacities." On March 25, 2013, the Yonejis
 filed their opposition to Mary's MSJ (Opposition to MSJ).
 
On April 2, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
Mary's MSJ, where it granted in part and denied in part Mary's
 request for summary judgment. The circuit court denied Mary's
 request for summary judgment as to the Yonejis' conversion and
 unjust enrichment claims, pending the receipt of the Special
 Master's report holding:
 
The Court is granting in part and denying in part [Mary's
MSJ]. In particular, as to each specific count, the Court
again pending the receipt of the final report of the master
finds that there are genuine issues of material fact with
respect to whether Mary withdrew more money than she was
authorized to withdraw.
 
And so, summary judgment is denied on the issue of the
conversion. As to constructive fraud, conspiracy, prima
facia [sic] tort and constructive trust, the Court finds
that there are no genuine issue [sic] of material fact, and
the Court is granting summary judgment in [Mary's] favor. As
to the issue of unjust enrichment, just as the Court is
waiting on the final report of the master, and there is
issue [sic] of whether Mary withdrew more than she was
authorized to withdraw, the Court finds that there are
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
genuine issue [sic] of material facts.
 
In its MSJ Order filed May 1, 2013, the circuit court reduced its
 
decision to a written order granting summary judgment in Mary's
 favor on the Yonejis' claims for constructive fraud, conspiracy,
 prima facie tort, and constructive trust and denying summary
 judgment as to the Yonejis' conversion and unjust enrichment
 claims. The circuit court also awarded Mary $38,158.05 in
 attorneys' fees and $6,173.74 in costs because Neil and Claire
 brought claims in their individual capacities.
 B. Motion in Limine

 
2
On March 4, 2013, in preparation for trial,  Mary filed
a motion in limine to exclude testimony of Kent Tanigawa

 
(Tanigawa), a witness for the Yonejis, and any reference to a
 
quitclaim deed that allegedly deeded the Charlene Trust and Owen
 
Trust interests in the Properties to Tanigawa. Mary's motion in
 limine argued that Tanigawa should not be permitted to testify
 during trial because the matter to which he was to speak "[was]
 not relevant and ha[d] no probative value in proving that
 Defendants Mary and Charlene withdrew $
152,113.13 from the one
 
single Mitsuo Trust bank account in April 2008."
 
The Yonejis' opposition to Mary's motion in limine
 
alleged that on December 10, 2010, after an apparent partition
 action and after the Yonejis had filed their Complaint, Mary
 executed a quitclaim deed to Tanigawa for a collective 42.5%
 interest in the Properties from the Charlene Trust and Owen
 Trust. The Yonejis alleged that the transfer of those interests
 contravened a previously confirmed sale of the Properties to
 Neil. The Yonejis alleged that Neil, as trustee of the Yoneji
 Family Trust, was supposed to close escrow on the sale of the
 Properties by March 30, 2011, but the Yonejis could not close as
 planned because they had to wait for Mary to execute another
 quitclaim deed transferring title from Tanigawa back to the
 
2
 The circuit court held a trial on the Yonejis' remaining
conversion and unjust enrichment claims in 2013 on April 22-26, April 29-30,
and May 1.
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Charlene Trust and Owen Trust. The Yonejis alleged that the
 
delay resulted in two months worth of missed rent revenue from
 the Properties that should have been included in the damages
 calculations.
 
On April 17, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
Mary's motion in limine and orally granted her motion, finding
 that Tanigawa's testimony and evidence of the quitclaim deed were
 irrelevant to the current proceedings. On April 24, 2013, the
 circuit court entered a written order granting Mary's motion in
 limine to exclude Tanigawa's testimony.
C. Special Master's Report and Testimony
 
On April 10, 2013, the Special Master issued his
 
report. On April 15, 2013, the Yonejis filed a "Request for
 
Judicial Notice of the Report of Special Master" (Request for
Judicial Notice) to have the report admitted into evidence.
 
Shortly thereafter, and in adherence with the stipulated
 
procedure for objections to the Special Master's report, Mary
 filed an objection to the report on April 16, 2013, claiming (1)
 "[t]he Court should use the 'Available Cash Balance' on Page 11
 of the Final Report as the Special Master has allocated the
 monies to each of the four owners based on their pro rata
 ownership interest in the Properties as the original basis before
 applying any credits or debits to any person or party"; (2) "the
 Final Report fails to address Mary's Counterclaim"; and (3) "the
 Final Report incorrectly states that Mary's attorney is holding
 $152,772.46, which is incorrect, as it has been deposited with
 the Court."
 
At the April 22, 2013 hearing, the circuit court
 
considered and then denied the Request for Judicial Notice
 because (1) the Yonejis' request was an improper subject for
 judicial notice and (2) Mary objected to the introduction of the
 report.
3 During the hearing, the circuit court also determined
 
3
 We note that following the April 17, 2013 hearing on Mary's
motions in limine, the circuit court indicated that the Special Master would
be a witness at trial and his report would be taken into evidence.
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Special Master, Carleton Williams (Special Master Williams),
 
would not be allowed to testify during the Yonejis' case-in-chief
 
because the Yonejis did not name him as a witness. The circuit
 court did instruct, however, that the Yonejis were still free to
 call Special Master Williams as a rebuttal witness during trial.
 On April 24, 2013, the circuit court filed its "Order Denying
 Plaintiffs' Request For Judicial Notice of Report of Special
 Master (Filed 4/15/13)."
 
At the April 25, 2013 hearing, the Yonejis again
 
attempted to introduce the Special Master's report into evidence
 by orally requesting that the circuit court adopt the report. 
The circuit court took the matter under advisement, but never
 issued a ruling on the Yonejis' request.
 
On April 29, 2013, the Yonejis requested to introduce
 
Special Master Williams as a rebuttal witness. The court denied
 the Yonejis' request, reasoning the following:
 
The Court, considering the stipulation for appointment of a
special master, the Court noting that the [Yonejis] have not
named [Special Master Williams] as a witness, and the Court
noting the expert testimony that has already been received
by way of exhibits and testimony, the Court is denying the
[Yonejis'] request to call [Special Master Williams] as the
rebuttal witness.
 
The circuit court specifically indicated that its decision to not
 
allow Special Master Williams to testify was 
based on what I have pointed out to the parties. It's based
 
on the fact that [Special Master Williams] is not named as
[Yonejis'] witness. It's based on the fact that the special
master was intended to be a neutral party.
 
It's also based on the fact that counsel have had the 
benefit of reviewing the final report by the master and thatthis has provided guidance to you, and it's based on what'sprovided in [Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule
53.
 
The trial then proceeded without the Special Master's report and
 
without the testimony from Special Master Williams.
D. Third Check for $16,384.20
 
On April 15, 2013, the Yonejis filed a "Motion for
 
Leave to Amend Complaint" (Motion to Amend Complaint) in order to
 
amend their original October 26, 2009 Complaint to include facts
 
pertaining to an additional $16,384.20 check from April 14, 2008,
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which the Yonejis did not include in their original Complaint. 
In their Motion to Amend Complaint, the Yonejis alleged, inter
 alia:
 
19. On April 14, 2008, [Mary] wrote a counter check
drawn on the bank account in the amount of $16,384.20
Payable to [FHB] which, on the same day, issued an OfficialBank Check payable in the same amount to [Owen] in the sameamount, which Official Bank Check was deposited in [Mary's]individual bank account on Kaua' i Government Employee's
[Federal Credit Union]. 
The Motion to Amend Complaint alleged that the Yonejis did not
 
plead evidence of the third check for $16,384.20 because they did
 not know about the check when they filed their original Complaint
 and only learned of the third check "[d]uring the course of
 discovery[.]" The Yonejis did not indicate the exact date on
 which they learned of the third check. On April 17, 2013, Mary
 filed her opposition.
 
On April 23, 2013, the Yonejis attempted to admit the
 
check in to evidence to refresh Mary's recollection during her
 cross-examination. Mary testified that she prepared two official
 bank checks from the Mitsuo Trust Account in the amounts of
 $67,031.14 and $85,081.99. The Yonejis repeatedly asked Mary
 
whether she made any other withdrawls from the Mitsuo Trust
 Account in April 2008. Mary indicated that she "[could not]
 recall at [that] time." The Yonejis attempted to refresh Mary's
 recollection by introducing the third check for $16,384.20 into
 evidence. Mary's counsel objected based on the circuit court's
 denial of the Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint.
4 The circuit
 
court sustained Mary's objection. The Yonejis argued that the
 check was relevant because Mary claimed that she could not
 remember whether there were any other withdrawals. The Yonejis
 argued that "justice require[d] that [they] at least put it in
 evidence and let the jury decide." The circuit court sustained
 Mary's objection.
 
4
 Although the circuit court entered its written order denying the
Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint on April 24, 2013, the written order states
that it previously denied the Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint on April 17,
2013.
 
9
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On April 24, 2013, the circuit court entered its
 
written order denying the Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint.
 
On April 25, 2013, the Yonejis again attempted to admit
 
testimony related to the third check but the circuit court
 
refused to allow the testimony. While on direct examination, the
 Yonejis' counsel questioned Neil about the amounts of the checks
 that Mary had withdrawn from the Mitsuo Trust Account. As Neil
 began to list the amounts, Mary's counsel preemptively objected,
 claiming that "[Neil] want[ed] to mention the $16,384.20, which
 the Court denied." Unlike previous attempts to admit the check,
 the Yonejis claimed that the testimony of the third check went to
 Mary's modus operandi and credibility, and that "Mary had done
 this twice, and this is the third withdrawl." The Yonejis argued
 that they should be allowed to amend their Complaint to include
 evidence of the third check, pursuant to HRCP Rule 15, which
 allows a party to amend their Complaint at trial. The circuit
 court sustained Mary's objection.
E. Punitive Damages Instruction
 
On April 29, 2013, after the close of all evidence and
 
before the submission of the case to the jury, Mary made an oral
 motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to HRCP Rule 50
 as to the Yonejis' punitive damage claims. Mary argued the
 circuit court should grant judgment as a matter of law as to the
 Yonejis' punitive damage claim because (1) the Yonejis' Complaint
 did not properly plea punitive damages and (2) the Yonejis failed
 to present evidence as to whether Mary acted maliciously,
 wantonly, or willfully to warrant a punitive damages instruction. 
In response, the Yonejis orally moved to amend their Complaint so
 to conform to the evidence, under HRCP Rule 15. The circuit
 court orally granted in part Mary's request for judgment as a
 matter of law as to the Yonejis' punitive damages claim, finding
 that "[t]here is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a
 reasonable jury to find in favor of this claim[.]" The circuit
 court also denied the Yonejis' HRCP Rule 15 request to amend
 their Complaint. On May 1, 2013, the circuit court reduced its
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
decision to a written "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
Defendant Mary Kazumi Yoneji and Joined Claimant Mary Kazumi
 Yoneji, Successor Trustee of the Revocable Trust of Owen Kazuo
 Yoneji Dated January 11, 1994 and the Revocable Trust of Charlene
 Tsuruko Yoneji Dated January 11, 1994's Motion for Judgment as a
 Matter of Law" (Motion for JMOL), which granted Mary's request
 
for judgment as a matter of law as to the Yonejis' punitive
 
damages claim. During the determination of jury instructions,
 the Yonejis agreed to withdraw its request for a punitive damages
 instruction but "only in view of the Court's determination of the
 motion for directed verdict."
 
On May 1, 2013, the jury found Mary liable for
 
conversion and unjust enrichment. The jury found that Mary
 converted $129,645.59, representing the profits from rents that
 Mary retained. The jury also found that Mary was unjustly
 enriched in the amount of $74,546.21 with this amount subsumed in
 the overall amount of $129,645.59.
 
F. Costs
 
On June 18, 2013, the Yonejis filed their "Notice of
 
Taxation and Costs" (Request for Costs). On June 21, 2013, Mary
 
filed her objection. The Yonejis filed their opposition to
 
Mary's objection on July 16, 2013.
 
The circuit court held a hearing on the Yonejis'
 
Request for Costs on July 24, 2013, and denied the Yonejis'
 request pertaining to (1) Special Master William; (2) accounting
 consultants, the firm of Bowen Hunsaker Hirai and Reed Hayes; (3)
 mediator Keith Hunter; and (4) the interpreter fee and costs
 related to the February 22, 2013 deposition of Charlene. The
 circuit court reduced its ruling to an order on August 26, 2013.
G. Final Judgment and Notice of Appeal
 
On August 28, 2013, the circuit court entered its Final
 
Judgment. The Final Judgment incorporated the jury's verdict
 
against Mary, modified the jury award by allocating the award
 based on the percentage ownership of each trust (with a total of
 $74,546.21 to the Yonejis in their capacities as trustees), and
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
awarded costs to the Yonejis in the amount of $32,256.94.
 
On September 25, 2013, the Yonejis filed a timely
 
notice of appeal in case no. CAAP-13-0003566, which this court
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction on January 10, 2014. 
On March 7, 2014, the circuit court entered its Amended Final
 Judgment. On April 7, 2014, the Yonejis filed a timely notice of
 appeal in this case.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant
 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas,  107
 
Hawai'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005). 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Id. at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (internal citations and brackets
 
omitted) (quoting Durette v. Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 
490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)).
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has set forth the following 
burden-shifting paradigm for situations where the non-movant
 
bears the burden of proof at trial:
 
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as
to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of
substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a
matter of law. This burden has two components.
 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing
support for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material
fact exists with respect to the essential elements of the
claim or defense which the motion seeks to establish or
 which the motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed
facts, it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law. Only when the moving party satisfies its initial
burden of production does the burden shift to the nonmoving
party to respond to the motion for summary judgment and
demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general
allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Second, the moving party bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion. This burden always remains with the moving
party and requires the moving party to convince the court
that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the
moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law.
 
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai 'i 46, 56-57, 292 P.3d 1276, 1286-87 
(2013) (quoting French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 
462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 (2004)).
 
[A] summary judgment movant may satisfy his or her initial
burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence
negating an element of the non-movant's claim, or (2)
demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to carry his
or her burden of proof at trial. Where the movant attempts
to meet his or her burden through the latter means, he or
she must show not only that the non-movant has not placed
proof in the record, but also that the movant will be unable
to offer proof at trial. Accordingly, in general, a summary
judgment movant cannot merely point to the non-moving
party's lack of evidence to support its initial burden of
production if discovery has not concluded.
 
Ralston, at 60-61, 292 P.3d at 1290-91 (citations and emphasis

C. Admission of Evidence
 
In State v. West, 95 Hawai 'i 452, 24 P.3d 648 (2001), 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated: 
[D]ifferent standards of review must be applied to trial
court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence,
depending on the requirements of the particular rule of
evidence at issue. When application of a particular
evidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, the
proper standard for appellate review is the right/wrong
standard. However, the traditional abuse of discretion
standard should be applied in the case of those rules of
evidence that require a "judgment call" on the part of the
trial court.

D. Judgment as a Matter of Law
 
It is well settled that a trial court's rulings on motions
for judgment as a matter of law are reviewed de novo.
 
When we review the granting of a [motion for
judgment as a matter of law], we apply the same
standard as the trial court.
 
A [motion for judgment as a matter of law] may
be granted only when after disregarding conflicting
evidence, giving to the non-moving party's evidence
all the value to which it is legally entitled, and
indulging every legitimate inference which may be
drawn from the evidence in the non-moving party's
favor, it can be said that there is no evidence to
support a jury verdict in his or her favor.

ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly
erroneous assessment of the evidence. Stated
 differently, an abuse of discretion occurs where the

or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
1. Constructive Fraud
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in granting 
summary judgment in favor of Mary as to their constructive fraud 
claim. "Constructive fraud is defined as an act done or omitted which is construed as a fraud by the court because of its detrimental effect upon public interests and public or private confidence, even though the act is not done or omitted with an actual design to perpetrate actual fraud or injury." Wolfer v. 
Mut. Life Ins. Co. of New York, 3 Haw. App. 65, 76, 641 P.2d 1349, 1357 (1982). "Constructive fraud is characterized by the breach of fiduciary or confidential relationship." Aames Funding 
Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai
'i 95, 104, 110 P.3d 1042, 1051 (2005) 
(quoting Honolulu Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Murphy, 7 Haw. App. 196, 201 n.6, 753 P.2d 807, 811 n.6 (1988)). 
In Mary's MSJ, she contended there was no genuine issue
 
of material fact as to the Yonejis' constructive fraud claim
 because "[t]here is no special relationship or confidential
 relationship between [Mary] and [the Yonejis] which would impose
 a fiduciary duty on [Mary] in this case." Mary specifically
 claimed that "[she] is not a trustee of the Mitsuo Trust, nor a
 trustee of the Yoneji Family Trust."
 
Mary's argument that she is not liable because she is
 
not a trustee is not supported by law. According to Wolfer, Mary
 did not need to be a trustee in order to be liable for
 constructive fraud. See Wolfer, 3 Haw. App. at 76-77, 641 P.2d
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 1357. In Wolfer, this court opined that
 
Constructive fraud often exists where the parties to a
transaction have a special confidential or fiduciary
relation which affords the power and means to one to take
undue advantage of, or exercise undue influence over, the
other.
 
Relationships between trustee and beneficiary, principal and
agent, and attorney and client are familiar examples in
which the principle of fiduciary or confidential
relationship applies in its strictest sense. Its operation,
however, is not limited to dealings between parties standing
in such relations, but extends to all instances when a
fiduciary or confidential relation exists as a fact, in
which there is confidence reposed on one side and a
resulting superiority and influence on the other.
 
Id. (emphasis added). Whether a fiduciary or confidential
 
relationship exists "depends on evidentiary facts and the weight
 
to be accorded thereto." Id. at 77, 641 P.2d at 1357.
 
Mary's MSJ presented no evidence that would negate the 
Yonejis' claim that she had a confidential relationship with them nor did Mary show that the Yonejis would be unable to place necessary proof in the record at trial. See Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i 
at 60-61, 292 P.3d at 1290-91. Therefore, Mary failed to satisfy her initial burden and summary judgment was not proper as to the Yonejis' constructive fraud claim.
2. Conspiracy
 
The Yonejis claim that the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment in Mary's favor as to their conspiracy
 claim. "Generally speaking, 'the accepted definition of a
 conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons [or entities]
 by concerted action to accomplish a criminal or unlawful purpose,
 or to accomplish some purpose not in itself criminal or unlawful
 by criminal or unlawful means.'" Robert's Hawaii Sch. Bus, Inc.
 
v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai
'i 224, 252 n.28, 982 P.2d 
853, 881 n.28 (1999), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel Ltd., 122 Hawai
'i 423, 430, 
228 P.3d 303, 310 (2010); see Menashe v. Bank of New York, 850 F. Supp. 2d 1120, 1138 (D. Hawai
'i 2012). "Because 'there can be no 
civil claim based upon a conspiracy alone,' a plaintiff must allege an underlying actionable claim." Menashe, 850 F. Supp. 2d 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 1138 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Weinberg v. 
Mauch, 78 Hawai 'i 40, 49, 890 P.2d 277, 286 (1995); Ellis v. 
Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 57, 451 P.2d 814, 822-23 (1969) (holding that the plaintiffs' failure to allege an underlying claim of deceit precluded them from alleging conspiracy to deceive). 
Mary's MSJ contended that the Yonejis "cannot show that 
[Mary and Charlene] acted in concert for an unlawful purpose or committed a criminal act" because Mary was an authorized signer on the Mitsuo Trust account which contained the $152,113.13. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that, when moving for summary 
judgment, the "moving party has the initial burden of identifying those portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i at 59, 292 
P.3d at 1289. "[A] summary judgment movant may satisfy his or her initial burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of the non-movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating that the nonmovant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof at trial." See id. at 60-61, 292 P.3d at 
1290-91. Mary's MSJ presented no evidence to negate the Yonejis' claim that she worked in concert with Charlene nor did Mary show that the Yonejis would be unable to prove that at trial. Instead, Mary improperly placed the burden of proof on the Yonejis. See id. Mary failed to satisfy her initial burden and 
the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in Mary's favor as to the Yonejis' conspiracy claim.
3. Prima Facie Tort
 
The Yonejis also claim that the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment in favor of Mary as to their prima
 facie tort claim. We previously held in Yoneji v. Yoneji, 2015
 WL 4604915, 354 P.3d 1160 (Haw. App. July 31, 2015) (No. CAAP-14Â­0000496) (Yoneji I) that a prima facie cause of action is only
 
available to a plaintiff in "cases that are factually similar to
 
Giuliani [v. Chuck, 1 Haw. App. 379, 386, 620 P.2d 733, 738
 (1980)] and where no other well-recognized causes of action are
 pled to address the alleged harm." See Yoneji, 2015 WL 4604915
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at *9, 354 P.3d at 1169.
 
The Yonejis' prima facie tort claim states:
 
COUNT IV
 
PRIMA FACIE TORT
 
39. Paragraphs 1 through 38 are incorporated herein by
reference as though fully realleged hereat.
 
40. The foregoing acts and omissions of [Mary and
Charlene], acting in concert and/or with one or more Doe
Defendants, were unjustified and performed with intent to
cause injury to the interests of [the Yonejis].
 
41. Additionally, [Mary and Charlene] acting in
concert and/or with one or more Doe Defendants, are jointly
and severally liable for damages suffered by [the Yonejis]
as a result of the aforementioned unjustified acts.
 
42. As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid
prima facie tort, [the Yonejis] have suffered and are
entitled to recover compensatory damages from the
above-named [Mary and Charlene] and/or one or more Doe
Defendants, including special, general, consequential and
punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial,
together with an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, costs
and interest.
 
The alleged harm to the Yonejis could be remedied by their
 
conversion and conspiracy claims against Mary. Therefore, under
 this court's holding in Yoneji I and Giuliani, the Yonejis' prima
 facie tort claim must fail as a matter of law.
 
4. Constructive Trust
 
The Yonejis claim the circuit court erred in granting
 
summary judgment in favor of Mary as to their constructive trust
 claim. "A constructive trust will be imposed where the evidence
 is clear and convincing that one party will be unjustly enriched
 if allowed to retain the entire property." Maria v. Freitas, 73
 
Haw. 266, 274, 832 P.2d 259, 264 (1992).
 
Mary's MSJ argued that summary judgment was appropriate
 
as to the Yonejis' constructive trust claim because "Mary [did]
 not have possession of the $152,113.13 since [Mary] ha[d]
 interpled $152,772.46 with the Court." In response, the Yonejis
 claimed that a question of fact remained as to whether Mary
 interpled with the circuit court all money removed from the
 Mitsuo Trust Account. At the time Mary submitted her MSJ, all
 parties were still waiting for a stipulated report from a Special
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Master who was tasked with
 
1.	 [Conducting] an audit of the assets, revenues, and
expenses of the [Properties] from March 1, 2008 to
present.
 
2.	 [Determining] the interests of the co-owners of the
[Properties] and their past and present entitlement to
profits and responsibility for expenses.
 
3.	 [Determining] the final account among the co-owners,
taking into consideration all distributions and the
proceeds/credit from the sale of the [Properties].
 
4.	 [Determining] the parties' rights to the amounts
related to the [Properties] held, in custody and/or
control by any of the parties and the clerk of the
Court.
 
Both parties had agreed that "the trier of fact shall rely on the 
report of the Special Master in determining the amounts, if any, owed by and between all parties in the above entitled action, subject to their determination of any disputed genuine issue of material fact (as set forth by the Court)[.]" The circuit court denied summary judgment on the Yonejis' conversion and unjust enrichment claims, pending the receipt of the final report from the Special Master. Given the pending report from the Special Master, Mary's MSJ failed to show that the Yonejis would have been unable to prove their constructive trust claim at trial and the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in Mary's favor. See Ralston, 129 Hawai
'i at 61, 292 P.3d at 1291. 
B. Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in awarding
 
Mary attorneys' fees and costs. In the MSJ Order, the circuit
 court found that pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Â§ 607Â­
14.5 (Supp. 2014), the Yonejis' claims for conversion,
 
constructive fraud, conspiracy, prima facie tort, and unjust
 enrichment, and constructive trust, brought in their individual
 capacities, were frivolous and not reasonably supported by the
 facts and the law. The circuit court awarded reasonable
 attorneys' fees of $38,158.05 and costs of $6,173.74 in favor of
 Mary and against the Yonejis.
 
HRS Â§ 607-14.5(a) provides:
 
Â§607-14.5 Attorneys' fees and costs in civil
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
actions. (a) In any civil action . . . where a party seeks
money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against another
party, and the case is subsequently decided, the court may,
as it deems just, assess against either party, whether or
not the party was a prevailing party, and enter as part of
its order . . . a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and
costs, in an amount to be determined by the court upon a
specific finding that all or a portion of the party's
claim . . . was frivolous . . . .
 
See Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawai 'i 292, 
300, 972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999). "A frivolous claim has been
 
defined as 'a claim so manifestly and palpably without merit, so
 as to indicate bad faith on the pleader's part such that argument
 to the court was not required.'" Id. (citing Coll v. McCarthy,
 
72 Haw. 20, 29, 804 P.2d 881, 887 (1991)). The Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court has recently stated that "[a] finding of frivolousness is a
 high bar; it is not enough that a claim be without merit, there
 must be a showing of bad faith." Tagupa v. VIPDesk, 135 Hawai
'i 
468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015).
 
HRS Â§ 607-14.5(b) and (c) instruct the following:
 
Â§607-14.5 Attorneys' fees and costs in civil
 
actions.
 
(b) . . . In determining whether claims or defenses
are frivolous, the court may consider whether the party
alleging that the claims or defenses are frivolous had
submitted to the party asserting the claims or defenses a
request for their withdrawal as provided in subsection (c).
If the court determines that only a portion of the claims or
defenses made by the party are frivolous, the court shall
determine a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and costs in
relation to the frivolous claims or defenses.
 
(c) A party alleging that claims or defenses are
frivolous may submit to the party asserting the claims or
defenses a request for withdrawal of the frivolous claims or
defenses, in writing, identifying those claims or defenses
and the reasons they are believed to be frivolous. If the
party withdraws the frivolous claims or defenses within a
reasonable length of time, the court shall not award
attorneys' fees and costs based on those claims or defenses
under this section.
 
Mary's MSJ argues that the Yonejis' claims in their
 
individual capacities were frivolous because neither Claire nor
 
Neil owned the Properties in their individuals capacities and
 thus lacked standing. Although the Yonejis' claims in their
 individual capacities may have not been supported by the facts or
 the law, the facts do not indicate that the Yonejis acted in bad
 
20

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
faith. 
Prior to Mary's MSJ, Mary had not requested that the
 
Yonejis withdraw their individual claims. See HRS Â§ 607-14.5(c). 
In their Opposition to MSJ, the Yonejis took it upon themselves
 
to withdraw all claims made in their individual capacities. At
 the April 2, 2013 hearing on Mary's MSJ, the Yonejis' counsel
 indicated that Neil included claims in his individual capacity
 because he had to file the lawsuit with his own money as there
 were no funds in the Mitsuo Trust Account for him to do so in his
 capacity as a trustee. The Yonejis' counsel indicated that they
 made the decision to withdraw the individual claims after Neil
 had been repaid his out-of-pocket expenses for cost associated
 with the lawsuit because it was no longer necessary for him or
 Claire to pursue those claims in their individual capacities. In
 addition, the Yonejis' counsel indicated that he meant to speak
 to Mary's counsel about withdrawing the individual claims at
 Neil's deposition and the settlement conferences, but that the
 conversation "never got specific enough to get to that point."
 There is no evidence in the record that the Yonejis pursued their
 individual claims in bad faith. Therefore, the circuit court
 abused its discretion in awarding Mary attorneys' fees and costs
 pursuant to HRS Â§ 607-14.5.
C. Evidence
 
1. Special Master's Report and Testimony 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in
 
excluding the testimony of Special Master Williams at trial. At
 
a hearing on April 17, 2013, the court indicated its
 understanding to the parties that the Special Master's report
 would be an exhibit and Special Master Williams would testify
 during trial. At a proceeding several days later the circuit
 court changed its position and instructed the parties that
 Special Master Williams could not testify in the Yonejis' caseÂ­
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
5
in-chief,  but noted he might be allowed to testify as a rebuttal
witness if the Yonejis appropriately addressed the need for a

 
rebuttal witness. Subsequently, the circuit court at trial
 
prevented the Yonejis from having Special Master Williams testify
 as a rebuttal witness, citing to its previous ruling. Although
 the parties stipulated to the use of a Special Master and the
 circuit court signed off on the stipulation, the circuit court
 continuously denied the Yonejis' repeated attempts to admit the
 Special Master's report into evidence. The circuit court appears
 to not have admitted the Special Master's report based on the
 belief, inter alia, that the report was to only have "provided
 guidance" to the parties and it was somehow inconsistent with
 HRCP Rule 53 to have the report relied upon by the trier of fact. 
"Parties are ordinarily bound by their stipulations, 
although we have allowed stipulations to be set aside in order to prevent manifest injustice." Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. 
Lau
, 79 Hawai 'i 201, 204, 900 P.2d 777, 780 (1995), as amended 
(Sept. 14, 1995). Here, the Yonejis stipulated to the use of a Special Master to resolve the following issues: 
1. With respect to the Subject Properties, an accounting of
all loans, sales, distributions, revenues, expenses,
received, spent, used and/or withdrawn by any one or more of
the Parties during the period March 1, 2008 to the present
("Subject Period"); and
 
2. With respect to the management of the Subject Properties
for the Subject Period, any discovered improprieties or
mismanagement (diversion or non-reporting of income,
improper expenses, improper distributions, withdrawals,
etc.) including without limitation, the dates, the parties
involved and the amount of any loss.
 
The Stipulation itself contemplated that parties may disagree
 
with the findings in the Special Master's report and provided the
 parties an opportunity to object. The stipulation specifically
 indicates that "[a]fter filing of the final report, the parties
 
5
 The circuit court reasoned that Special Master Williams could not
testify in the Yonejis' case-in-chief because the Yonejis had not named him as
a witness on their witness list. However, the Yonejis' witness list
specifically indicates that "[The Yonejis] reserve the right to call any
witness identified in [Mary's] witness list, but not identified herein."
Mary's witness list names Special Master Williams as both a lay and an expert
witness.
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
shall have an opportunity to object to any portion of the report
 
before the Court adopts findings and issues a judgment." The
 Stipulation instructs that the court, considering the objections,
 "shall determine whether there are any genuine issues of material
 fact to be determined by the trier of fact." (Emphasis added.)
 The Stipulation further instructs that "the trier of fact shall
 rely on the Special Master in determining the amounts, if any,
 owed by and between all parties . . . subject to their
 determination of any disputed genuine issue of material fact (as
 set forth by the Court)." (Emphasis added.)
 
Here, the circuit court refused to adopt the findings
 
of the Special Master report without determining what genuine
 issues of material facts remained for the trier of fact to
 determine. In fact, it appears that once Mary raised her initial
 objection to the report, the circuit court chose to ignore the
 stipulated Special Master report altogether.
 
A trial court is bound to follow the procedures set
 
forth in a stipulation, unless there was a finding of manifest
 injustice. See Gakiya v. Hallmark Properties, Inc., 68 Haw. 550,
 
552, 722 P.2d 460, 462 (1986) (finding a manifest injustice that
 warranted departure from a stipulated agreement where the party
 seeking to enforce the stipulation was not prejudiced and party
 against whom the agreement was to be enforced was prejudiced). 
Given that the circuit court made no determination as to whether
 a manifest injustice existed, the court erred in deviating from
 the procedures set forth in the Stipulation. 
Furthermore, a review of the record indicates that no
 
such manifest injustice existed to warrant a departure from the
 procedures set forth in the Stipulation. In preparation for the
 trial, both parties had agreed to use a Special Master to
 determine complex issues of fact. The parties stipulated to the
 use of a Special Master after determining that
 
the amounts owed by and between all parties in the
above-entitled action is complex due to multiple ownership
interests in the Subject Properties, the change in property
management between the respective parties, alleged improper
commingling/management, and review of numerous accounting,
checking, [sic] account and other financial documents, bank

statements and records, some of which are a part of the
files and records herein and incorporated herein by
reference[.]
 
See HRCP Rule 53.6 The circuit court approved the Stipulation
 
and even relied upon the pending Special Master's report to deny-
in-part Mary's request for summary judgment. 
The Yonejis relied upon the court-approved Stipulation
 
and the circuit court's determination that the Special Master's

 
report would be admitted into evidence to prepare for trial.

 powers as well as inherent power to control the litigation

 HRCP Rule 53 controls references to Special Masters and provides:
 
Rule 53. MASTERS. 
(a) Appointment and Compensation. The court in which
 
any action is pending may appoint a special master therein.
As used in these rules the word "master" includes a referee,
an auditor, an examiner, and an assessor. The compensation
to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and
shall be charged upon such of the parties or paid out of any
fund or subject matter of the action, which is in the
custody and control of the court as the court may direct.
The master shall not retain the report as security for
compensation; but when the party ordered to pay the
compensation allowed by the court does not pay it after
notice and within the time prescribed by the court, the
master is entitled to a writ of execution against the
delinquent party.
 
(b) Reference. A reference to a master shall be the
 
exception and not the rule. In actions to be tried by a
jury, a reference shall be made only when the issues are
complicated; in actions to be tried without a jury, save in
matters of account and of difficult computation of damages,
a reference shall be made only upon a showing that some
exceptional condition requires it.

issues of material fact, the Special Master's report shall be
 
admissible for consideration by the trier of fact. 
A review of the procedural history indicates that the
 
Yonejis requested that Special Master Williams testify at trial
 only after the circuit court refused to admit his report into
 evidence. To the extent that the circuit court did not follow
 the stipulated procedure, we need not address the issue of
 whether Special Master Williams should have been permitted to
 testify at trial.
2. Motion in Limine
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court erred in
 
excluding the testimony of Tanigawa and evidence of the quitclaim
 deed from Charlene and Owen Trusts to Tanigawa. The circuit
 court excluded the evidence after finding Tanigawa's testimony
 and all evidence of the quitclaim deeds irrelevant. However, the
 Yonejis claimed Tanigawa's testimony and evidence of the
 quitclaim deeds were relevant because "[a] portion of the Family
 Trust's damages is attributable to the rent revenue lost between
 the time the transaction transferring title to the Family Trust
 would have closed, but for Mary's transfer to Tanigawa."
 
Based on the facts in the record, Mary's alleged
 
transfer of Charlene and Owen Trusts' property interests to
 Tanigawa occurred after the Yonejis filed their original
 Complaint and was the result of a legally separate partition
 action. The Yonejis thus could not have pled harm from the
 partition sale in their Complaint because the transfer to
 Tanigawa had not yet occurred. The harm caused by the delayed
 partition sale was not a "natural[] and necessar[y] result" from
 the legal wrong alleged (i.e., Mary's conversion of funds from
 the Mitsuo Trust Account and unjust enrichment) so as to
 constitute a basis for general damages, as the Yonejis claim. 
See Ellis, 51 Haw. at 50, 451 P.2d at 819.
 
"General damages are said to encompass all the damages
 
which naturally and necessarily result from a legal wrong done." 
Id. By contrast, special damages are those damages that "do not
 
26
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
arise solely from the wrongful act itself, but rather depend on
 
the circumstances peculiar to the infliction of each particular
 injury." Id. At best, the alleged harm that resulted from the
 
partition delay was incidental to the overall harm alleged in the
 Yonejis' Complaint so as to constitute a basis for special
 damages. HRCP Rule 9(g) provides that "[w]hen items of special
 damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated." Because
 the Yonejis did not plead special damages in their Complaint,
 they were not entitled to an award of special damages. See
 
Ellis, 51 Haw. at 51, 451 P.2d at 819. Therefore, the circuit
 court did not err in concluding that Tanigawa's testimony and
 evidence of the quitclaim deed were not relevant to the issue of
 general damages in the Yonejis' lawsuit. See HRE Rule 401.

3. Third Check for $16,384.20
 
The Yonejis claim the circuit court erred in excluding
 
evidence of a third check by which Mary allegedly took funds from
 the Mitsuo Trust Account. The opening brief provides no legal
 argument in support of their contention. Instead, the Yonejis'
 opening brief merely alleges that "when the Yonejis attempted to
 introduce evidence related to the check at trial, the circuit
 court thwarted every attempt by them to do so."
 
Pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 28(b)(7), appellate courts "will disregard [a] particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position[.]" Kaho
'ohanohano v. Dep't of Human 
Servs., State of Hawai 'i, 117 Hawai 'i 262, 297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538,

'i Supreme Court's ruling 
in Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai 'i 490, 280 P.3d 88 (2012),

 HRE Rule 401 provides:
 
Rule 401. Definition of "relevant evidence". 
"Relevant evidence" means evidence having any tendency to
make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action more probable or less probable
than it would be without the evidence.

"noncompliance with Rule 28 does not always result in dismissal 
of the claims, and [appellate courts have] consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible." Marvin, 127 
Hawai
'i at 496, 280 P.3d at 94 (citations, internal quotation 
marks, ellipses and original brackets omitted). "This is particularly so where the remaining sections of the brief provide the necessary information to identify the party's argument." Id. 
Therefore, we will address the Yonejis' arguments on appeal to the extent discernible. 
The Yonejis' Complaint alleged that Mary wrote two
 
checks from the Mitsuo Trust Account without Neil's authorization
 and deposited the funds from the checks in an account to which
 Neil did not have access. The Complaint provided the following:
 
15. On April 11, 2008, [Mary] wrote a check drawn on
FHB Account No 30-069056 in the amount of $67,031.14 to
[FHB] which on the same day issued an Official Bank Check
payable in the same amount to [Charlene], Mary's mother.
The Official Bank Check indicated that [Mary] had purchased
same "for [Owen] & [Neil]."
 
16. [Neil] did not authorize the April 11, 2008
disbursement of funds from the Mitsuo Trust checking
account.
 
17. On April 28, 2008, [Mary] wrote a counter check
drawn on FHB Account No 30-069056 in the amount of
 $85,081.99 payable to [FHB] which on the same day, issued an
Official Bank Check payable in the same amount to [Owen].
The Official Bank Check indicated that [Mary] had purchased
the same for (or on behalf of) the Mitsuo Trust.
 
18. [Neil] did not authorize the April 28, 2008
disbursement of funds from the Mitsuo Trust checking
account.
 
On April 15, 2013, more than three years after filing their
 
initial Complaint, the Yonejis filed a Motion to Amended
 Complaint, pursuant to HRCP Rule 15, which sought to include
 facts pertaining to a third check alleged issued on April 14,
 2008. The Yonejis' requested amended complaint alleged, inter
 alia:
 
19. On April 14, 2008, [Mary] wrote a counter check
drawn on the bank account in the amount of $16,384.20
Payable to [FHB] which, on the same day, issued an Official
Bank Check payable in the same amount to [Owen] in the same
amount, which Official Bank Check was deposited in [Mary's]

individual bank account on Kaua' i Government Employee's FCU. 
Under HRCP Rule 15(a)(2), "a party may amend the
 
party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of
 
the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice
 so requires." The "grant or denial of leave to amend under
 [HRCP] Rule 15(a) is within the discretion of the trial court and
 is subject to reversal on appeal only for an abuse of
 discretion." Keawe v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., 65 Haw. 232, 239, 649
 
P.2d 1149, 1154 (1982) (citation and internal quotation marks
 omitted). Reasons to deny leave to amend include "undue delay,
 bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated
 failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,
 undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of
 the amendment, [and] futility of amendment[.]" Bishop Trust Co.
 
v. Kamokila Dev. Corp., 57 Haw. 330, 337, 555 P.2d 1193, 1198
 (1976) (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). 
The Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint alleged that
 
they did not plead evidence of the third check for $16,384.20
 because they did not know about the check when they filed their
 Complaint and only learned of the third check "[d]uring the
 course of discovery." However, during the April 2, 2013 hearing
 on Mary's MSJ and before the Yonejis filed their Motion to Amend
 Complaint, the Yonejis cited to the third check in support of
 their unjust enrichment claim. When the circuit court asked why
 the Yonejis had not amended their original Complaint to include
 the third check, the Yonejis' counsel responded that "[HRCP]
 would allow us to amend the Complaint at trial if needed to
 comport with the evidence." Yonejis' co-counsel further
 elaborated that the Yonejis did not file a motion to amend
 complaint sooner because, "after years of not having any
 documents, we received numerous documents and weren't able to go
 through all of them in time to . . . file a motion to amend the
 complaint with all the other trial deadlines that had come up." 
Based on the response from the Yonejis' counsel, it
 
appears the Yonejis felt no urgency to amend their Complaint. 
29
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The record indicates the Yonejis did not file their Motion to 
Amend Complaint until a week before trial was scheduled to begin
 and after the circuit court's April 2, 2013 hearing on Mary's
 MSJ.
 
The Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint fails to provide
 
any detail as to when they discovered the third check or what
 prevented them from discovering the third check sooner. Neil
 testified during trial that he had access to the financial
 information from the Mitsuo Trust Account. The Yonejis' Motion
 to Amend Complaint, however, provides no explanation for why Neil
 did not obtain information about a third check when they
 discovered the first two checks.
 
Given that the Yonejis did not exhibit due diligence in 
determining what funds were withdrawn from the Mitsuo Trust Account when they filed their original Complaint, failed to provide evidence of when they learned of the third check, and indicated an original intent to wait until trial to amend the Complaint, the Yonejis' conduct reasonably constituted an undue delay. See Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 
Hawai
'i 92, 112, 176 P.3d 91, 111 (2008) (denying Plaintiff's 
motion to amend Complaint because Plaintiff unduly delayed proposing her additional claim). Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint. 
The Yonejis also attempted to admit evidence of the
 
third check during trial. At an April 23, 2013 proceeding, the
 Yonejis attempted to admit the check in to evidence to refresh
 Mary's recollection during her cross-examination. The Yonejis
 argued that "justice require[d] that [they] at least put [the
 third check] in evidence and let the jury decide." At an April
 25, 2013 proceeding, the Yonejis again attempted to admit
 testimony related to the third check as evidence of Mary's modus
 operandi, claiming that "Mary had done this twice, and this is
 the third withdrawal." The circuit court sustained both of
 Mary's objections to the Yonejis' attempted lines of questioning. 
30
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Given our holding that the circuit court did not err in
 
denying the Yonejis' Motion to Amend Complaint to include the
 
third check, we fail to see how the question of whether Mary
 wrote any other checks from the Mitsuo Trust Account was relevant
 to the issue of whether Mary was liable for conversion or unjust
 enrichment in regards to the original two checks. See HRE Rule
 
104 (1993).
 
Furthermore, under HRE Rule 404(b), although evidence
 
of modus operandi is admissible, "[e]vidence of other crimes,
 wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a
 person in order to show action in conformity therewith." The
 Yonejis attempted to introduce evidence of the third check as
 conclusive evidence that Mary had deliberately removed funds from
 the account on three separate occasions. The Yonejis' attempted
 line of questioning is, therefore, not admissible under HRE Rule
 404(b). In addition, given the minimal probative value of the
 proffered evidence as it related to modus operand, and the
 likelihood that the evidence would confuse the jury as to what
 issues were before them, testimony regarding the third check
 
9
fails the HRE Rule 403  balancing test.  Therefore, the circuit
 
court did not err in sustaining Mary's objection and finding that
 evidence of the third check was not admissible evidence.
 
D. Punitive Damages Jury Instruction 
The Yonejis argue the circuit court erred in denying
 
the Yonejis' request to provide punitive damages jury
 
instructions. Because we vacate and remand this case back to the
 circuit court, this point on appeal is moot.
E. Costs
 
The Yonejis argue on appeal that the circuit court
 
9
 HRE Rule 403 provides:
 
Rule 403. Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds
of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time. Although
relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,
confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
presentation of cumulative evidence. 
31
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
abused its discretion in denying several of the Yonejis' requests
 
for costs. Because we vacate and remand this case back to the
 circuit court, there is no prevailing party for whom costs may be
 assessed. Nevertheless, we will address the Yonejis' points on
 appeal pertaining to the circuit court's denial of costs so to
 provide guidance to the circuit court on remand.
1. Charlene's Deposition Costs
 
The Yonejis claim that "the circuit court abused its
 
discretion by failing to award deposition costs associated with
 the percipient witness [Charlene]." The circuit court granted
 the Yonejis' deposition transcript costs for all depositions,
 except for the $1,115.64 spent on the deposition of Charlene. 
The Yonejis argued that costs pertaining to Charlene's deposition
 were appropriate because, although Charlene was originally a
 named defendant in their lawsuit, she was also a pertinent
 witness to the Yonejis' lawsuit against Mary. The circuit court
 ultimately denied the Yonejis' request for Charlene's deposition
 costs because Charlene had been the prevailing party in her
 motion for summary judgment.
 
This court has held that "[w]here the prevailing party
 
has taken the deposition, the cost of the original deposition may
 be taxed when it is deemed reasonable." Nani Koolau Co. v. K & M
 
Const., Inc., 5 Haw. App. 137, 143, 681 P.2d 580, 586 (1984); See
 
10 11 12 
HRS Â§Â§ 624-35 (1993),  607-9 (1993);  and HRCP Rule 54(d).  "A

HRS Â§624-35 Costs.  The costs of depositions may be
taxed in the bill of costs as provided by section 607-9.
 
11
 HRS Â§ 607-9 provides:
 
Â§607-9 Cost charges exclusive; disbursements. No
 
other costs of court shall be charged in any court in
addition to those prescribed in this chapter in any suit,

law.

to, intrastate travel expenses for witnesses and counsel,
expenses for deposition transcript originals and copies, and

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
determination of reasonableness is within the discretion of the
 
trial court and is dependent upon whether the deposition was
 necessarily obtained for use in the case." Nani Koolau, 5 Haw.
 
App. at 144, 681 P.2d at 586 (citing Geldert v. State, 3 Haw.
 App. 259, 268, 649 P.2d 1165, 1172 (1982)). "Whether a
 deposition was necessarily obtained for use in the case hinges
 upon the trial court's factual evaluation of the course and
 progress of the proceeding and the nature of the evidence." Nani
 
Koolau, 5 Haw. App. at 144, 681 P.2d at 586 (citation and
 internal quotation marks omitted).
 
The Yonejis claim that because one of the checks Mary
 
wrote was addressed to Charlene, they would have called Charlene
 as a witness regardless of whether Charlene was a named defendant
 in their lawsuit. Thus, according to Nani Koolau, although
 Charlene was a named party, her deposition was still necessarily
 obtained for the case that the Yonejis were building against Mary
 so to justify an award of costs. See id.
 
Furthermore, the Yonejis are seeking costs against
 
Mary, not against Charlene. HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) provides that
 "[e]xcept when express provision therefor is made either in a
 
11(...continued)
other incidental expenses, including copying costs,
intrastate long distance telephone charges, and postage,
sworn to by an attorney or a party, and deemed reasonable by
the court, may be allowed in taxation of costs. In
determining whether and what costs should be taxed, the
court may consider the equities of the situation.
 

12
 HRCP Rule 54 provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 54. 
JUDGMENTS; COSTS; ATTORNEYS' FEES.
 
. . . .
 
(d)
 Costs; attorneys' fees.
 
(1) Costs Other Than Attorneys' Fees. Except when
express provision therefor is made either in a statute or in
these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the
prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs; but
costs against the State or a county, or an officer or agency
of the State or a county, shall be imposed only to the
extent permitted by law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on
48 hours' notice. On motion served within 5 days
thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the
court.
 
33
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
staute or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to
 
the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs[.]"
 Consequently, the fact that Charlene was the prevailing party in
 the Yonejis' lawsuit against her should have had no bearing on
 the circuit court's determination of whether Charlene's
 deposition was "necessarily obtained for use in the case" against
 Mary. Nani Koolau, 5 Haw. App. at 144, 681 P.2d at 586. 
Therefore, the circuit court abused its discretion in denying the
 Yonejis' request for taxation of cost of Charlene's deposition
 fees.
 
2. Special Master's Cost
 
The Yonejis argue that "the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in denying the Yonejis' taxation of cost of the
 Special Master fees." The Yonejis requested $16,407.06 for the
 portion of the Special Master's fees that were included in the
 Stipulation and an additional $1,857.87 for additional costs
 incurred to keep Special Master Williams available to testify at
 trial. The circuit court appears to have denied the Yonejis'
 request for taxation of cost of the Special Master's fee based on
 the fact that (1) the Stipulation provided a preliminary
 breakdown for how advanced costs and fees were to be distributed
 between the parties and (2) the Yonejis kept the Special Master
 available as a witness, even after the court ruled that "he had
 not been named a witness and not been recognized as a witness."
 
The Stipulation provided that 
10. The fees and costs associated with the appointment
of the Master shall be finally determined by agreement or by
Court Order, provided that any required advance for such
fess [sic] and cost shall be made (without prejudice) as
follows: 42.5% by Neil/Claire Yoneji Trust, 42.5% by
Owen/Charlene Yoneji Trust and 15% by the Mitsuo Yoneji
Trust. For purposes of the Master's timekeeping, the Master
shall keep time for his or her analysis for matter from
March 1, 2008 to August 15, 2009, separate from his or her
analysis from August 15, 2009, to the present.
 
(Emphasis added.) The Stipulation did not provide a conclusive
 
distribution of fees and costs associated with the Special
 Master, as the circuit court's reasoning would suggest. Instead,
 the Stipulation provided a preliminary breakdown of how required
 
34
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advance fees and costs should be divided between each trust
 
involved and instructed that final determinations of payment
 distribution shall be "determined by agreement or by Court
 Order[.]" The circuit court did not issue a final order as to
 how the Special Master's fees and cost should be distributed
 between the trusts nor did the parties come to an agreement on
 the issue. Absent a finding that the stipulated procedure would
 result in a manifest injustice, the circuit court was not at
 liberty to depart from the stipulated procedure by picking and
 choosing which provisions of the Stipulation to follow. See
 
Gakiya, 68 Haw. at 555, 722 P.2d at 464 ("While parties
 ordinarily are bound by the terms of their stipulations, we have
 allowed certain stipulations to be set aside or modified in order
 to prevent manifest injustice."). Given that Mary and the
 Yonejis did not enter into a final agreement as to the
 distribution of Special Master's fees and costs, the circuit
 court erred in denying the Yonejis' request for taxation of cost
 of the Special Master fees without first issuing a court order
 detailing how the Special Master's fees would be distributed
 between the parties.
3. Mediation Costs
 
The Yonejis claim "the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in failing to award the Yonejis the cost of the
 mediator's fees." The Yonejis requested an award of costs for
 their share of mediation services that occurred on April 19,
 2009. The circuit court ruled that "[a]s to the fees that were
 incurred by
 the mediator, Mr. Keith Hunter, again, looking at the costs that
 are specifically authorized by Chapter 607, the Court is also
 denying this request."
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has specifically held that 
requests for costs related to mediation may be granted, even though not explicitly listed in HRS Â§ 607-9 as taxable. See 
Arquette v. State, 128 Hawai
'i 423, 445, 290 P.3d 493, 515 
(2012). The supreme court distinguishes between court-ordered 
35
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
mediation and voluntary mediation, holding that "unlike 
court-ordered mediation, a voluntary decision to enter mediation is 'severable from and unrelated to the litigation,' Wong [v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai
'i 46, 54-55, 961 P.2d 611, 619-20 (1998)], 
inasmuch as under such circumstances voluntary mediation is not a necessity of litigation." Arquette, 128 Hawai
'i at 446, 290 P.3d 
at 516. Consequently, the supreme court has held that "when the parties voluntarily enter into mediation, it has been concluded that the losing party cannot be assessed the costs of mediation absent a compelling demonstration by the prevailing party." Id. 
This standard is grounded in the logic that "[a] cost incurred by the parties' joint decision to attempt to avoid trial would appear to be a cost separate from the underlying litigation, as it represents a shared attempt to avoid the costs of trial." Id. 
(emphasis omitted) (citing Wong, 88 Hawai
'i at 54-55, 961 P.2d at 
619-20 (1998)). 
Ultimately, the Yonejis carried the burden of 
demonstrating to the circuit court a compelling reason to award their requested mediation costs. See Arquette, 128 Hawai
'i at 
446, 290 P.3d at 516. The Yonejis argued that their mediation costs were warranted because "[w]hile the instant lawsuit was not filed until October 26, 2009, the facts and claims herein existed at mediation." The record indicates that the mediator may have touched on issues relevant to the lawsuit, but that mediation also addressed issues that related to partition concerns that were separate from the issues found in the current lawsuit. Given that the mediation occurred before the commencement of the current lawsuit in an effort to resolve a variety of issues, some unrelated to the current lawsuit, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Yonejis' request for mediation fees. See id. at 445, 290 P.3d at 515. 
4. Expert Consultation Costs
 
The Yonejis contend the circuit court abused its
 
discretion in denying costs arising from the Yonejis' retention
 and use of an accounting expert. The Yonejis requested $8,835.82
 
36
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for the services of accounting consultants Bowen Hunsaker Hirai
 
and Reed Hayes. The circuit court denied the Yonejis' request,
 finding that Bowen Hunsaker Hirai and Reed Hayes were
 "consultants," not experts, and did not testify at trial. 
The Yonejis claimed Bowen Hunsaker Hirai and Reed Hayes
 
were originally retained to provide an expert opinion at trial,
 but that the Yonejis later "relied upon the Stipulation
 appointing a Special Master, which negated the need for the
 expert." The Yonejis argued that "[b]ecause [their] consultant
 was hired to provide opinions at trial, and because his report
 was produced to [Mary], [the Yonejis'] expert/consultant's fees
 are taxable costs." The record indicates that Bowen Hunsaker
 Hirai and Reed Hayes provided services to the Yonejis before the
 Yonejis stipulated to the use of a Special Master.
 
The Yonejis appear to take issue with the circuit 
court's finding that Bowen Hunsaker Hirai was hired as a consultant, arguing that the accounting firm was "actually hired to provide expert testimony." In support of their appeal, the Yonejis claim that "an expert hired for use at trial is a taxable cost, even if the expert is not called to testify[,]" and cite to Canalez v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawai
'i 292, 307, 
972 P.2d 295, 310 (1999) in support of their contention. However, the Yonejis' reliance on Canalez is misplaced because Canalez involved an award for expert costs pursuant to HRCP Rule 68,
13 whereas the Yonejis sought costs pursuant to HRCP Rule 
13
 HRCP Rule 68 provides:
 
Rule 68. OFFER OF SETTLEMENT OR JUDGMENT.
 
At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins,
any party may serve upon any adverse party an offer of
settlement or an offer to allow judgment to be taken against
either party for the money or property or to the effect
specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. If within
10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party
serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either
party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance
together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the
clerk shall, in accordance with the agreement, enter an
order of dismissal or a judgment. An offer not accepted
shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not

"an entirely new set of policy considerations" than an award of costs under HRCP Rule 54(d)); see also Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai

Because expert fees are not taxable costs under HRCP Rule 54(d), the circuit court did not err in denying the Yonejis' request for costs pertaining to fees for Bowen Hunsaker Hirai and Reed Hayes.

IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we vacate the following entered in the
 
Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit:
 
(1) the May 1, 2013 "Order Granting in Part and Denying
 
in Part Defendant Mary Kazumi Yoneji's Motion for Summary
 Judgment (Filed 2/26/13)," except that we affirm the portion of
 
13(...continued)
admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. If the

judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more
favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs
incurred after the making of the offer. The fact that an
offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a
subsequent offer. When the liability of one party to another
has been determined by verdict or order or judgment, but the
amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined
by further proceedings, either party may make an offer of
judgment, which shall have the same effect as an offer made
before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not
 less than 10 days prior to the commencement of hearings to
determine the amount or extent of liability.

 We further note that it is of no consequence whether Bowen
Hunsaker Hirai and Reed Hayes were retained as expert witnesses, as the
Yonejis contend, or consultants, as the circuit court found, because this
court has previously held that costs for consultant fees are also not allowed.
