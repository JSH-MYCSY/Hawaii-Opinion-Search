v. 
CHRISTOPHER DEEDY, Defendant-Appellee,
and KARL BLANKE, ESQ., Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-1647) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.) 
This is an appeal by Appellant Karle Blanke, Esq. 
(
Blanke), one of the trial counsel for Defendant Christopher 
Deedy (Deedy). Blanke appeals from the "Order Granting in Part 
and Denying in Part the State of Hawai# i's Motion for Sanctions 
Against Defense Counsel and Revocation of Pro Hac Vice Status in 
the State of 
Hawai# i" (Sanction Order) entered by the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).  We conclude that we 
lack appellate jurisdiction in this appeal because the Sanction Order is not an independently appealable order under Hawaii 1

Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1 (2016)2 or the collateral order 
exception. 
On November 16, 2011, Deedy was indicted by a grand 
jury on the charges of Murder in the Second Degree and Carrying 
or Use of a Firearm in Commission of a Separate Felony stemming from an incident on November 5, 2011, which resulted in the death of Kollin Elderts (Elderts). 
On January 24, 2013, Deedy's Motion to Associate Pro 
Hac Vice Counsel was granted and Blanke, a Virginia attorney, was admitted to serve 
pro hac vice in Hawai# i along with local 
counsel. 
During closing arguments, Blanke stated that Elderts 
"resisted arrest" during a prior incident in which Elderts was arrested. 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (the State) 
objected, moved to strike, and requested sanctions for Blanke's statement regarding Elderts. The Circuit Court sustained the objection, struck the argument, and directed the jury to disregard Blanke's statement. 
On August 26, 2013, the jury returned deadlocked and 
the Circuit Court declared a mistrial. 
On September 27, 2013, the State filed a Motion for 
Sanctions Against Defense Counsel and Revocation of Pro Hac Vice Status in the State of 
Hawai# i (Motion for Sanctions). 
2 HRS § 641-1 provides: 
§641-1 Appeals as of right or interlocutory, civil
matters.  (a) Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from
all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and
district courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602.
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by

The refusal of the circuit court toallow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, ordecree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
(c) An appeal shall be taken in the manner and within
the time provided by the rules of court. 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On January 6, 2014, the Circuit Court held a hearing on 
the State's Motion for Sanctions. The Circuit Court orally 
stated "I'm going to sanction [Blanke] for $250" but declined to revoke Blanke's pro hoc vice status. 
On March 6, 2014, the Circuit Court filed the Sanction 
Order, which did not contain the monetary sanction the court had mentioned at the January 6, 2014 hearing. Instead, the Circuit Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding with regard to Eldert's prior incident that Blanke had intentionally used the term "resisting arrest" and misrepresented relevant facts in closing argument, notwithstanding Blanke's knowledge of the court's prior decisions precluding the use of the term "resisting arrest" related to that incident. 
Both Blanke and the State filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the Sanction Order. The Circuit Court denied both motions for reconsideration in an order issued on April 17, 2014. 
Blanke filed a notice of appeal from the Sanction 
Order, citing HRS § 641-11 (2016)
3 as establishing this court's 
jurisdiction over the matter. 
However, on June 16, 2014, Blanke filed a Statement of 
Jurisdiction, which states he "wishes to make clear in this Statement of Jurisdiction that this appeal is being brought pursuant to H.R.S. Section 641-1 and not H.R.S. 641-11." (Emphasis added). 
On October 22, 2014, Blanke filed an Amended Opening 
Brief, again citing HRS § 641-1 as the source of this court's appellate jurisdiction to hear his case. 
3 HRS § 641-11 provides: 
§641-11 From circuit courts.  Any party aggrieved by
the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may
appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject tochapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided bythe rules of court. The sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment. All appeals shall be filed withthe clerk of the supreme court and shall be subject to onefiling fee. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-1 creates the right to appeal from "civil 
matters[.]" Here, the Sanction Order was issued in a criminal 
case, after motions and a hearing before a circuit court judge in the same criminal case, for conduct that occurred in the criminal case. Therefore, Blanke's appeal is from the criminal case. See, e.g., State v. Adam, 97 
Hawai# i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 
(2002) (exercising the Supreme Court of Hawai# i's jurisdiction 
pursuant to HRS § 641-11 over an appeal of attorney sanctions in a criminal case as an appeal from the criminal case). We do not have appellate jurisdiction over Blanke's appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1, the statute cited in his Jurisdictional Statement and Amended Opening Brief. 
We also conclude that the collateral order exception 
does not apply for purposes of this appeal to establish appellate jurisdiction. 
The Supreme Court of Hawai# i first applied the 
collateral order exception to a criminal case as a rare, common law exception to the statutory final judgment rule against interlocutory appeals, adopting the rule directly from the Supreme Court of the United States: 
Under this exception, certain orders fall "in that small
class which finally determine claims of right separablefrom, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, tooimportant to be denied review and too independent of thecause itself to require that appellate consideration bedeferred until the whole case is adjudicated." 
State v. Baranco, 77 Hawai# i 351, 353, 884 P.2d 729, 731 (1994) 
(quoting Cohen v. Benneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 
546 (1949)). "Accordingly, 'an interlocutory order is appealable if it: (1) fully disposes of the question at issue; (2) resolves an issue completely collateral to the merits of the case; and (3) involves important rights which would be irreparably lost if review had to await a final judgment.'" State v. Kealaiki, 95 Hawai# i 309, 316-317, 22 P.3d 588, 595-596 (2001) (quoting 
Baranco, 77 Hawai# i at 353-54, 884 P.2d at 731-32). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In a subsequent criminal case, this court held that the 
circumstances in that case did not "fit within the narrow 
guidelines of the collateral order exception," and we "must construe the collateral order doctrine narrowly and be parsimonious in its application." State v. Johnson, 96 
Hawai# i 
462, 471, 32 P.3d 106, 115 (App. 2001) (citations omitted). 
Indeed, in Johnson, this court held that "[g]enerally, 
the collateral order exception is applicable in criminal cases only upon a denial of pretrial motions to reduce bail, motions to dismiss based on double jeopardy grounds, and motions to dismiss under the Speech and Debate Clause." Id. at 470, n.12. 32 P.3d at 114, n.12 (citing Midland Asphalt Corp. v. U.S., 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) ("[w]e have interpreted the collateral order exception with the utmost strictness in criminal cases. Although we have had numerous opportunities . . . to consider the appealability of prejudgment orders in criminal cases, we have found denials of only three types of motions to be immediately appealable: motions to reduce bail, motions to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, and motions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also State v. Minn, 79 
Hawai# i 461, 464, 903 P.3d 1282, 1285 (1995) (holding 
that because the defendant appealed from an order denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the complaint on double jeopardy grounds, the court had jurisdiction to entertain defendant's appeal); Baranco, 77 Hawai# i at 354-55, 884 P.2d at 732-33 
(holding that the collateral order exception to the final judgment rule permits interlocutory appeal of an order denying a pretrial motion to dismiss indictment on double jeopardy grounds). 
We note that at least one other jurisdiction has 
analyzed, using the Cohen test, whether the collateral order exception may apply to orders sanctioning criminal defense attorneys. 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In U.S. v. Dickstein, the Tenth Circuit Court of 
Appeals held that a criminal defense attorney's appeal from a 
sanction order revoking his pro hac vice status foundered on the third part of the Cohen test, requiring that the order must be effectively unreviewable on appeal in order to be immediately appealable, because such an order was appealable upon entry of final judgment or acquittal. 971 F.2d 446, 448-52 (10th Cir. 1992). Dickstein, the criminal defense attorney, argued that his reputation had been irreparably harmed by the sanction order revoking his pro hac vice status in the criminal suit, and therefore the sanction order must be permitted immediate review. Id. at 451. The Tenth Circuit rejected this notion, holding that: 
[u]nder Dickstein's theory, any appeal of a claimed injury
to reputation must be instantaneously and quickly reviewed,or else the damage becomes irreparable. Such cannot be the case. Dickstein will be able to challenge the propriety of
the revocation of his pro hac vice  status when final 
judgment has been entered in [his client's] case. 
Id. The Tenth Circuit further held that Dickstein could still 
appeal even if his client was acquitted. Id. at 450 (citing Dietrich Corp. v. King Resources Co., 596 F.2d 422, 424 (10th Cir.1979) (holding that a legal consultant could appeal the district court's fee determination, even though the consultant was neither a party nor an attorney of record, because the consultant "is an aggrieved party and his property interest can be protected only by recognizing this as one of those extraordinary cases where a nonparty may be allowed to appeal."). 
We find the Tenth Circuit's reasoning for rejecting 
reputational damage as a basis for applying the collateral order exception persuasive. 
In the instant case, Blanke argues that: 
The non-monetary sanctions which Judge Ahn herself announced
she was imposing surely have a very serious impact onBlanke's reputation and consequent ability to earn a livingpracticing law. Ultimately, all any attorney has is his orher skill, reputation and good name, but when one'sreputation and good name are impugned by a judicial officer,skill alone is often never enough to rebuild what has beentorn down. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Blanke does not cite to any other actual harm resulting from the 
Order. Therefore, like the court in Dickstein, we turn to whether the Sanction Order is appealable upon entry of a final judgment of conviction or acquittal.

"As a general rule, an appeal from a final judgment in 
a case brings up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." See Adam, 97 Hawai# i at 482, 40 P.3d at 884 
(citations omitted). In Adam, the attorney for a criminal defendant appealed from a sanction order imposed against him by the trial court, and a final judgment was subsequently entered after the defendant's trial. Id. at 481, 40 P.3d at 883. 
The 
Hawai# i Supreme Court held that it had appellate jurisdiction 
over the attorney's appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and Rule 4(b) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).  Id. at 482, 
40 P.3d at 884. Thus, a timely appeal from a final judgment, whether Deedy is convicted or acquitted, would bring up for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case and we would have appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-11 and HRAP Rule 4(b). 5
Based on the foregoing, we lack jurisdiction over 
Blanke's appeal from the Sanction Order under the collateral order exception. 
4 As of the date of this order, the Hawai #i Supreme Court has held that
the State is entitled to try Deedy a third time. 
State v. Deedy, 141 Hawai #i 
208 (2017). However, the United States District Court for the District of
Hawai #i (District Court ) has held to the contrary, that Deedy may not be tried
again. Deedy v. Suzuki, 326 F.Supp.3d 1022 (D. Haw. 2018). The District Court's decision is currently on appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
5 Under HRAP Rule 4(b), the attorney's earlier notice of appeal was
deemed filed on the date the final judgment was entered. Id. at 482, 40 P.3dat 884.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
