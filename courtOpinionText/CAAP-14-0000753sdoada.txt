IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAY BLANCO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-1199)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Jay Blanco appeals from the
 
March 11, 2014 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence
 
1
("Judgment")  and the May 6, 2014 Amended Judgment of Conviction
2
and Sentence ("Amended Judgment"),  entered in the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court"). 
The Judgment stated that
 
Blanco was convicted of both charged offenses: (1) Assault in the
 
Second Degree ("Assault 2"), in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") §§ 707-711(1)(b) and/or 707-711(1)(d) (Supp.
 2011), and (2) Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree
 ("TT1"), in violation of HRS § 707-716(1)(e) (Supp. 2011). The
 Circuit Court sentenced Blanco to five years of probation and
 imposed a crime victim compensation fee. Additionally, as a
 special condition of probation, Blanco was to serve four months
 of imprisonment with credit for time served.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Almost two weeks after filing his Notice of Appeal with
 
this court, Blanco filed a "Motion to Modify Sentence and Amend
 
Judgment" with the Circuit Court. In the motion, Blanco asked
 that the Circuit Court amend the Judgment to reflect the fact
 that he was, in fact, only convicted on one count of Assault 2,
 pursuant to HRS § 701-109(1)(a), and, to modify his imprisonment
 sentence by crediting him with time already served, pursuant to
 HRS § 706-621(2)(i). On May 6, 2014, the Circuit Court entered
 the Amended Judgment, which deleted the reference to Blanco's
 conviction for TT1. And in an order dated May 14, 2014, the
 Circuit Court granted the motion in part, amending the Judgment
 while declining to modify the sentence. 
On appeal, Blanco argues that the Circuit Court
 
(1) plainly erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of Assault in the Third degree, in violation of HRS § 707-712 ("Assault 3"), and the "included offense" of Assault in the Third Degree by mutual affray, in violation of HRS § 707-712, and (2) reversibly erred by convicting him of Assault 2 where the State of Hawai
'i failed to disprove his defense of 
self-defense. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance, the issues they raise, and the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Blanco's appeal as
 follows, and affirm. 
(1) The State charged Blanco with committing Assault
 
2, in violation of HRS §§ 707-711(1)(a), (b), and/or (d). Blanco
 argues that the Circuit Court plainly erred by failing to
 instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of Assault 3. 
We disagree.
 
The case turns on the HRS § 707-711(1)(d) charge
 
("Dangerous Instrument Assault 2 offense"). There was no
 evidence that provided a rational basis to reject the Dangerous
 Instrument Assault 2 offense and convict on the lesser-included
 offense in violation of HRS § 707-712(b) ("Dangerous Instrument
 Assault 3 offense"). The jury could have acquitted Blanco, if it
 did not believe that he had used the dangerous instrument at all,

but it could not, on the evidence presented, find that the
 
dangerous instrument was used only in a negligent manner.
 
The evidence that Blanco used the dangerous instrument
 
against the Complaining Witness ("CW") was the CW's testimony
 that Blanco approached the CW at Ala Moana Beach Park and accused
 the CW of looking at his wife/girlfriend, retrieved a knife from
 his car, opened it, chased the CW down, and hit the CW while the
 CW was on the ground; Sandy Anderson's testimony that she saw
 Blanco chasing the CW while holding a folding knife; Zachariah
 Anderson's testimony that Blanco hit CW with the knife "between
 two and five times"; and Dr. Torrey Lisa Goodman's testimony that
 the CW presented with a very deep, full-thickness laceration,
 approximately nine centimeters long on his left arm, an injury
 that she found to be consistent with the CW's explanation at the
 time that he had been attacked and slashed with a switchblade. 
None of the testimony supports a theory of negligence, or,
 consequently, a Dangerous Instrument Assault 3 instruction. 
Finally, Blanco argued that he did not stab the CW, not that he
 negligently stabbed him.
3 Therefore, the verdict of guilty based
 
on HRS § 707-711(1)(d) stands independent of the HRS §§ 707­711(1)(a) and/or (b) charge, regardless of any error regarding
 the failure to give an instruction on the lesser of the HRS §§
 707-711(1)(a) and/or (b) charge.
 
(2) When viewed in the light most favorable to the 
State, In re PP, 133 Hawai
'i 235, 238-39, 325 P.3d 647, 650-51 
(App. 2014), the testimonies of Sandy Anderson, Zachariah Anderson, Eric Nakamura, Officer Stephen Kardash, and Dr. Torrey Lisa Goodman presented sufficient evidence to convict Blanco of Assault 2 under HRS § 707-711(1)(a), (b), and/or (d). See Haw. 
Rev. Stat. §§ 707-711 & -712. 
3/
 Blanco argues that the court plainly erred by failing to instruct
the jury on the "lesser-included offense" of Assault in the Third Degree by
mutual affray under HRS § 707-712(2). Mutual affray, however, is not alesser-included offense of Assault 3, but, rather, a mitigating defense to
misdemeanor Assault 3. State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i 78, 95, 253 P.3d 639, 656
(2011). Because we conclude that the court did not err in failing to provide
a lesser-included offense instruction relating to the Dangerous InstrumentAssault 2 offense, we do not reach the mutual affray instruction issue.
