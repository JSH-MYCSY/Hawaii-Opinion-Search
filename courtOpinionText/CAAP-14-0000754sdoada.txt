SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
1/

 The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided.
 
2/
 The statute states, in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of disorderly
conduct if, with intent to cause physical inconvenience or
alarm by a member or members of the public, or recklessly
creating a risk thereof, the person:
 
. . . .
 
(b) Makes unreasonable noise; or
 . . . . 
(3) Disorderly conduct is a petty misdemeanor if it
is the defendant's intention to cause substantial harm or
 
serious inconvenience, or if the defendant persists in
disorderly conduct after reasonable warning or request to
desist. Otherwise disorderly conduct is a violation.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1101 (1993 and Supp. 2012). 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Gomez-Velasco contends that the District
 
Court erred because the evidence against him was insufficient to
 
prove that (1) the noise from the party was "unreasonable," or
 that (2) he intentionally caused, or recklessly created a risk of
 causing, "physical inconvenience or alarm [to] a member or
 members of the public[.]" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1101(1).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as
 the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Gomez-Velasco's
 points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
(1) First, we consider whether the Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai
'i proved that the noise was unreasonable. To do 
this, we need not consider "whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt," but rather, we determine "whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 
330-31 (2007). "'Substantial evidence' . . . is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. at 158, 166 P.3d 331 (quoting State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248–49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) (brackets omitted)). 
Under the statute, noise is "unreasonable" within the

 
meaning of subsection (1)(b) if:
 
considering the nature and purpose of the person's conduct
and the circumstances known to the person, including the
nature of the location and the time of the day or night, the
person's conduct involves a gross deviation from the
standard of conduct that a law-abiding citizen would follow
in the same situation; or the failure to heed the admonition
of a police officer that the noise is unreasonable and
should be stopped or reduced.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1101(2) (1993). Here, both Janet Takemoto,
 
the neighbor who telephoned the police to complain about early-
morning noise coming from Gomez-Velasco's residence, and Honolulu
 Police Department Officer Greg Arii, the officer who responded to
 Takemoto's call, testified to the volume of the noise. 
Specifically, Takemoto testified that she "was awakened by very
 loud music . . . it was super loud . . . there was loud laughter,
 talking, and the music was exceptionally loud . . . blaring."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Similarly, Officer Arii said that he could hear the music more
 
than 100 feet away from Gomez-Velasco's house, and after he began
 walking toward the residence, he could hear laughter and people
 talking. It is undisputed that the incident occurred well after
 midnight in a residential neighborhood. Moreover, Officer Arii
 testified that he told Gomez-Velasco multiple times to turn the
 music down because it was too loud, and that if he refused to do
 so, he would be arrested for disorderly conduct, but that Gomez-
Velasco refused to comply.
3/ Therefore, there was sufficient
 
evidence to support the District Court's conclusion that Gomez-
Velasco made "unreasonable" noise.
 
(2) Second, Gomez-Velasco contends that the State
 
failed to prove that he either "inten[ded] to cause physical
 inconvenience or alarm [to] a member or members of the public, or
 [that he] recklessly creat[ed] a risk thereof[.]" Haw. Rev.
 Stat. § 711-1101(1). We disagree.
 
The facts adduced at trial circumstantially prove that 
Gomez-Velasco acted with the requisite state of mind to uphold his conviction. Indeed, "the mind of an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai
'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 
399, 406 (1999) (quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai 'i 37, 44, 947 
P.2d 349, 356 (1997)). Here, Officer Arii told Gomez-Velasco that a neighbor had complained about the noise. Furthermore, Gomez-Velasco conceded that on the night of the incident, he and his guests were playing music, his guests "talk[ed] loud" and 
4/
 it was very early in the morning when the
 were drinking alcohol;noise complaint occurred; and he did not heed Officer Arii's

 
request that the noise be stopped or reduced. Moreover, the
 
3/
 Gomez-Velasco does not challenge the District Court's finding that
Officer Arii provided him with a reasonable warning, which is necessary to the
court's finding that Gomez-Velasco is guilty of a petty misdemeanor. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1101(3). As such, that finding is binding on this court.
See State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai' i 494, 502, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012) (citing
Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai' i 205, 227, 140 P.3d 985, 1007
(2006)). 
4/
 Gomez-Velasco initially denied that anyone was drinking alcohol,
but later conceded, upon further questioning, that at least two guests were
drinking. Officer Arii also testified that he could smell alcohol on Gomez-
Velasco.

evidence at trial established that Gomez-Velasco turned the music
 
back up after one of his guests had complied with Officer Arii's
 request. 
"[A]s trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make 
all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence." Matavale, 115 
Hawai
'i at 158, 166 P.3d at 331 (quoting Batson, 73 Haw. at 248­
49, 831 P.2d at 931). And when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution as we must, id. at 157, 166 P.3d at 330, that evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's inference that Gomez-Velasco's actions were intentional or reckless. 
In sum, there was substantial evidence adduced at trial
 
to support the conclusion that Gomez-Velasco acted with the
 intent to cause, or in reckless disregard of causing,
 inconvenience or alarm to a member or members of the public, that
 the noise was unreasonable, and that Gomez-Velasco was given a
 reasonable warning to desist, thereby committing the petty
 misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct. Haw. Rev. Stat.
 § 711-1101.
 
THEREFORE, the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
 
filed on March 20, 2014 in the District Court of the First
 Circuit, Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
