APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-421K and 13-1-007K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, the papers in support, and
 
the records and files herein, it appears that in Civil No. 12-1Â­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
421K/CAAP-13-0005823, (1) the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
issued a judgment in favor of Hawaii Community Federal Credit
 Union (HCFCU) based on its order granting summary judgment,
 decree of foreclosure, and order of sale on November 25, 2013;
 (2) in CAAP-13-0005823, this court entered a judgment on appeal affirming the judgment in Civil No. 12-1-421K on April 29, 2015; and (3) no order staying the sale of the subject property appears in either the record for CAAP-13-0005823 or CAAP-14-0000755. It further appears from a perusal of the Hawai
'i State Judiciary's 
Ho'ohiki website that, on December 18, 2014, a hearing on HCFCU's 
motion confirming the sale, for writ of ejectment, and for fees and costs was held and the motion was granted. 
Based upon this review, an Order to Show Cause (OSC)

 
was entered on November 17, 2015 directing the parties to show
 cause why this case should not be dismissed as moot. On that
 same date, the OSC was electronically served on (1) Charles R.
 Prather, Sofia Hirosane McGuire, and Steven Idemoto, attorneys
 for Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Bank of America,
 N.A., Successor by Merger to Bac Home Loans Servicing, LP
 formerly known as Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP and (2)
 Commissioner-Appellee, Michael J. Matsukawa (Matsukawa). The OSC
 was also mailed to Defendant/Counterclaimant/Appellant Tom Ernest
 Sena (Sena) on November 17, 2015. Pursuant to the OSC, responses
 were due on November 27, 2015. Matsukawa's response was filed on
 November 25, 2015. As of the date of this order, no other
 responses have been filed. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed as
 
moot.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within five (5) days from
 
the date of this order, Charles R. Prather, Sofia Hirosane
 McGuire, and Steven Idemoto, attorneys for Plaintiff/
 Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee Bank of America, N.A., Successor
 by Merger to Bac Home Loans Servicing, LP formerly known as
 Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP shall show cause why they
 have failed to respond to our November 17, 2015 OSC. Failure to
