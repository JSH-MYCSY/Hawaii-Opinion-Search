APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1326)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant/
 
Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Appellant Noguchi & Associates, Inc.
 (Appellant Noguchi), has asserted from the Honorable Jeannette H.
 Castagnetti's December 4, 2014 judgment, because the December 4,
 2014 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable
 If the circuit court intends that claims other than those
 
listed in the judgment language should be dismissed, it must
say so: for example, "Defendant Y's counterclaim is
dismissed," or "Judgment upon Defendant Y's counterclaim is
entered in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all

final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) 
(1993 & Supp. 2013), Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
For example: "Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on
(date), judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in
favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I
through IV of the complaint." A statement that declares
 
"there are no other outstanding claims" is not a judgment.

other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are
dismissed."
 
Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final
 judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court
 of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original emphasis). 
Although this case involves multiple claims through
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Pflueger, Inc.'s (Appellee Pflueger), four-
count complaint and Appellant Noguchi's cross-claims against
 Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellees AIU Holdings, Inc.
 (Appellee AIU Holdings) and National Union Fire Insurance Company
 of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Appellee National Union Fire
 Insurance), the December 4, 2013 judgment does not specifically
 identify the claim or claims on which the circuit court intends
 to enter judgment, in violation of HRCP Rule 58 under the holding
 in Jenkins. The December 4, 2013 judgment enters judgment in
 favor of Appellee Pflueger and against Appellant Noguchi in the
 amount of $1,432,210.45 without specifically identifying which of
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the four counts in Appellee Pflueger's four-count complaint the 
circuit court intends to enter judgment on. Therefore, the December 4, 2014 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. 
In addition, the December 4, 2013 judgment also does 
not satisfy the requirements for appealability because the December 4, 2013 judgment neither resolves all of the parties' claims nor contains an express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Granted, on March 14, 2013, the parties filed an HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) stipulation to dismiss Appellee Pflueger's complaint as to Appellee AIU Holdings and Appellee National Union Fire Insurance, and the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i holds that where parties 
properly stipulate to dismiss claims without an order of the court pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B), "a separate judgment is neither required nor authorized, inasmuch as a plaintiff’s dismissal of an action, by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties [pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B)], is effective without order of the court." Amantiad v. Odum, 90 
Hawai
'i 152, 158 n.7, 977 P.2d 160, 166 n.7 (1999) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). Nevertheless, the March 14, 2013 HRCP Rule 41(a)(1)(B) stipulation does not expressly dismiss Appellant Noguchi's cross-claims against Appellee AIU Holdings and Appellee National Union Fire Insurance, which, thus, the final judgment in this case must expressly enter 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment on or dismiss in order to be appealable. The 
December 4, 2013 judgment does not enter judgment on or dismiss Appellant Noguchi's cross-claims against Appellee AIU Holdings and Appellee National Union Fire Insurance, and yet, as a judgment that resolves fewer than all claims, the December 4, 2014 judgment does not contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the December 4, 2013 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, the appeal is 
premature and the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of Appeals lacks 
appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14­0000756. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0000756 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction. All pending motions are dismissed as moot.
