SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this appeal related to the sale of property in Kona 
Hawai'i (the "Property"), Plaintiff-Appellant Wheels of Justice, 
LLC appeals from the (1) March 13, 2014 Final Judgment, (2) the 
March 13, 2014 Order Granting Third-Party Defendant Nimble Land, Inc.'s Motion to Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action ("March 13, 2014 Expunge Order"), and (3) the May 6, 2014 Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration (Filed on March 28, 2014) of the Order Filed March 13, 2014 Granting Nimble Land, Inc's Motion to Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action and for Attorney's Fees and Costs and the Final Judgment Filed March 13, 2014, entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1/ The judgment and orders were entered against Wheels 
of Justice and in favor of Defendant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Cross­Claimant/Third-Party Plaintiff-Appellee Title Guaranty Escrow Services, Inc.; Defendant/Cross-Claimant/Cross-Claim Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff-Appellee Island Title Corporation; Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants-Appellees Clinton Hinchcliff, Jr., Clinton Hinchcliff, Sr., and Hinchcliff Investments, LLC; and Third-Party Defendant/Cross-Claimant-Appellee Nimble Land, Inc. 
On appeal, Wheels of Justice contends that the Circuit 
Court committed reversible error when it: (1) failed to properly notify Wheels of Justice's counsel of the order dismissing the case pursuant to Rule 12(q) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai
'i ("RCCH"); (2) denied Wheels of Justice's 
motion to set aside the order of dismissal; (3) denied Wheels of Justice's second request to set aside the order of dismissal; (4) entered the Final Judgment and the March 13, 2014 Expunge Order; and (5) denied Wheels of Justice's motion for reconsideration of the March 13, 2014 Expunge Order. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Wheels
 of Justice's appeal and vacate and remand the judgment.

Wheels of Justice asserts in its second point of error 
that the Circuit Court erred when it denied Wheels of Justice's 
motion to set aside the order of dismissal. "[W]here a court sua sponte issues an order of dismissal for want of prosecution, its action is reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion." Ryan v. 
Palmer, 130 Hawai
'i, 321, 323, 310 P.3d 1022, 1024 (App. 2013) 
(quoting Compass Dev., Inc. v. Blevins, 10 Haw. App. 388, 397–98, 876 P.2d 1335, 1340 (1994)) (acknowledging that this standard of review applies to an order denying a motion to set aside). 
RCCH Rule 12(q)'s language is patterned after Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 41(b)(2). Ryan, 130 
Hawai'i at 323, 310 P.3d at 1024. Under HRCP Rule 41(b)(2), a 
dismissal with prejudice is a "severe sanction" of "last resort" that cannot be affirmed "absent deliberate delay, contumacious conduct, or actual prejudice." Id. (emphasis added) (quoting In 
re Blaisdell, 125 Hawai
'i 44, 49, 252 P.3d 63, 68 (2011)). 
"[A]bsent a clear record of delay or contumacious 
conduct, 'the careful exercise of judicial discretion requires that a [trial] court consider less severe sanctions [than dismissal] and explain, where not obvious, their inadequacy for promoting the interests of justice.'" Blaisdell, 125 Hawai
'i at 
49, 252 P.3d at 68 (quoting Schilling v. Walworth Cty. Park & Planning Comm'n, 805 F.2d 272, 275 (7th Cir. 1986)). The Circuit Court made no findings of deliberate delay, contumacious conduct, or actual prejudice and offered no express considerations of less severe sanctions. 
Based on the record and the governing case law, we are
 
compelled to conclude that the Circuit Court abused its
 discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice solely for
 Wheels of Justice's failure to file a timely pretrial statement,
 in failing to apply the Blaisdell factors in dismissing the case,
 and in failing to explain why less severe sanctions were
 insufficient. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the March 13, 2014
 
Final Judgment and remand the case to the Circuit Court for
 proceedings consistent with this order. On remand, the Circuit
 Court is directed to reconsider its March 13, 2014 Order Granting
 Third-Party Defendant Nimble Land, Inc.'s Motion to Expunge
