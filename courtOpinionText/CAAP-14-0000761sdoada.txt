STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
WAILANA K. CRIVELLO HO, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-04236)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, filed on March 12, 2014, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).
1 
The charge against Defendant-Appellee Wailana K.
 
Crivello Ho (Ho) for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of
 an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2014) was dismissed
 with prejudice by the District Court. 
On appeal, the State claims the District Court erred by
 
dismissing the charge because it had no valid legal basis to do
 so.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the opening brief
 
submitted by the State, there being no answering brief filed by
 Ho, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced 
1
 The Honorable David W. Lo presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
and the issues raised, we resolve the State's point of error as
 
follows:
 
The District Court abused its discretion by dismissing
 
the charge against Ho because it lacked a legal basis for doing
 so. None of the three grounds which the District Court
 apparently relied upon to dismiss the charge (i.e., the reasons
 stated by defense counsel) provide a valid basis to dismiss the
 charge against Ho.
 
A court's inherent power to dismiss a criminal case 
arises from article VI, section 1 of the Hawai
'i Constitution 
which "grants courts the power to take steps necessary for the promotion of justice[.]" State v. Mageo, 78 Hawai
'i 33, 37, 889 
P.2d 1092, 1096 (App. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 647 P.2d 705 (1982)). We reviewed the District Court's pre-trial dismissal of the charge for abuse of discretion. State v. Moriwake, 65 Hawai
'i 47, 55, 
647 P.2d 705, 711 (1982). The District Court must balance "the interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court system." Mageo, 78 Hawai
'i at 37, 889 P.2d at 1096 (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has 
noted that situations such as a serious threat to the integrity of the judicial process, clear denial of due process, evidence some constitutional right has been violated, arbitrary action, or governmental misconduct have justified the use of such power by other courts. State v. Alvey, 67 Haw. 49, 57, 678 P.2d 5, 10 
(1984). However, judicial economy is "not a legitimate reason to dismiss an indictment prior to a defendant's first trial[,]" and "[e]xcept where Moriwake-type considerations apply, dismissing an indictment just to ease a crowded docket is an abuse of discretion." Id. at 58, 678 P.2d at 11 (citation omitted). 
In dismissing the charge against Ho, the District Court 
accepted Ho's argument that Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
2
(HRPP) Rule 48  had been violated, that Ho's driver's license was
2
 HRPP Rule 48(b) provides that:

administratively revoked and an ignition interlock device placed
 
on her vehicle, and that according to the District Court's
 practice, if the case had been previously transferred to another
 courtroom it would have been dismissed, instead of continued a
 second time at the State's request. 
Ho's case was called by the presiding District Court
 
3
judge on February 13, 2014,  who granted the State a second
continuance over the objection of Ho's counsel, and trial was re­set for March 12, 2014. 
In re-setting the trial date, the
 
presiding District Court judge stated that he wanted to set a
 trial date in order to comply with HRPP Rule 48, which expired on
 March 6, 2014. However, due to a scheduling conflict with Ho's
 counsel, Ho opted to have trial set for March 12, 2014 and waived
 her rights under HRPP Rule 48. When Ho then appeared for trial
 on March 12, 2014, the State was ready to proceed. There was no
 violation of HRPP Rule 48 on March 12, 2014. 
The District Court did not order the revocation of Ho's

 
driver's license and installation of an ignition interlock system
 on her vehicle. The Administrative Revocation Program, which
 allows for revocation of Ho's license and installation of an
 ignition interlock device is authorized pursuant to HRS 
§§ 291E-31 and 291E-44.5 (Supp. 2013). Any punishment as a

 By Court. Except in the case of traffic offenses that
are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on
motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced
within six months:
 
(1) from the date of arrest if bail is set or from the
filing of the charge, whichever is sooner, on any offense
based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal
episode for which the arrest or charge was made; or
 
(2) from the date of re-arrest or re-filing of the charge,
in cases where an initial charge was dismissed upon motion
of the defendant; or
 
(3) from the date of mistrial, order granting a new trial or
remand, in cases where such events require a new trial.
 
Clauses (b)(1) and (b)(2) shall not be applicable to any
offense for which the arrest was made or the charge was
filed prior to the effective date of the rule.

result of an OVUII conviction is not "additional" to the 
"nonpunitive and purely remedial" consequences of the Administrative Revocation Program. State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai
'i 
8, 23, 904 P.2d 893, 908 (1995). Therefore, Ho was not subject to multiple punishments. Id. 
There was no evidence of a serious threat to the
 
integrity of the judicial process, that a constitutional right
 had been violated, of arbitrary action, or of governmental
 misconduct in this case. Therefore, a dismissal of the charge by
 the District Court under these circumstances was an abuse of
 discretion. 
Finally, the District Court's dismissal of the charge, 
in effect, overruled the ruling by the prior District Court judge who had continued the matter, without any cogent reason explained on the record. See State v. Oughterson, 99 Hawai
'i 244, 254, 54 
P.3d 415, 425 (2002) ("Unless cogent reasons support the second court's action, any modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion." (citation and emphasis omitted)). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on March
 12, 2014, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division is vacated and the case is remanded for proceedings
 consistent with this order.

The charge against Defendant-Appellee Wailana K.
 
Crivello Ho (Ho) for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of
 an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2012) was dismissed
 with prejudice by the District Court. [JDCROA doc. 21 at 1]
 
On appeal, the State claims the District Court erred by
 
dismissing the charge because it had no valid legal basis to do
 so. [OB at 6]
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Ho was arrested on September 7, 2013 for OVUII. 
[JDCROA doc. 3 at 1] On October 1, 2013, Ho was charged by
 
written Complaint with OVUII. [JDCROA doc. 1 at 1-2] The case was
 called on October 7, 2013 where Ho was given a written copy of
 
the complaint. [JDCROA doc. 4, court minutes] On December 10,
 
2013, the case was called but the State's witness, Officer Wong,
 was sick so the case was continued over Ho's objection. [JDCROA
 
doc. 7, court minutes] 
On February 13, 2014 Ho appeared for trial. The State
 
again stated that Officer Wong was sick and asked for a
 
continuance. [JTr doc. 12 at 2] The State noted that the time
 
for HRPP Rule 48 would run on March 6, 2014. [JTr doc. 12 at 2]
 
The District Court granted the State's request for a continuance. 
[JTr doc. 12 at 2] However, Ho's defense counsel stated that he

 would not be available until March 11. [JTr doc. 12 at 3] The
 
District Court stated that trial would be set for March 5 unless
 
defense counsel requested a later date. [JTr doc. 12 at 3] The
 
District Court also stated that if the time for HRPP Rule 48 ran
 sooner, it would have set the trial sooner. [JTr doc. 12 at 5]
 
The District Court instructed counsel to discuss with Ho whether
 she would waive the time for HRPP Rule 48 or trial would be set
 for some time prior to March 6. [JTr doc. 12 at 5] After the case
 
was recalled, defense counsel asked what the normal course was
 
for continued DUI's in courtroom 10D to which the District Court
 responded two to four weeks. [JTr doc. 12 at 6] Defense counsel
 
objected to having the case set for trial before the normal
 
course but waived the time for HRPP Rule 48 purposes and trial
 was set for March 12. [JTr doc. 12 at 6-7] 
On March 12, 2014 Ho again appeared for trial. The
 
State stated that it was ready to proceed. [JTr doc. 14 at 2]
 
However, defense counsel claimed that HRPP Rule 48 time ran out
 the prior day. [JTr doc. 14 at 2] Counsel also noted that Ho had
 
to install an ignition interlock device on the vehicle twice and
 that her license was revoked until October 2014. [JTr doc. 14 at
 
2] Counsel stated that there should be consistency between
 treatment of all defendants and if the case was in courtroom 10D
 
it would have been dismissed but it was continued in courtroom
 10C instead. [JTr doc. 14 at 3] The State noted that 180 days
 
ended that day, it was ready to proceed, and a prior judge gave
 
the State a continuance. [JTr doc. 14 at 3-4] Defense counsel
 
noted that it is the court policy to move DUI cases to courtroom
 
10D if a defendant has private counsel and that in courtroom 10D
 the case would have been dismissed. [JTr doc. 14 at 4] The
 
6
  District Court ended the proceeding by stating "For all the
 
reason stated by [defense counsel], the matter's dismissed with
 prejudice. Bail to be returned." [JTr doc. 14 at 4-5]
 
On March 12, 2014, a written the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment was entered which
 dismissed the charge with prejudice. [JDCROA doc. 21 at 1]
 
II. 	STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Abuse of Discretion - Criminal
 
"Generally, to constitute an abuse, it must appear that 
the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded 
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. Crisostomo, 94 Hawai
'i 
282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The District Court abused its discretion by dismissing
 
the charge against Ho because it lacked a legal basis for doing
 
so. None of the three legal bases which the District Court
 relied upon to dismiss the charge provide a valid basis to
 dismiss the charge against Ho.
 
A court's inherent power to dismiss a criminal case
 
arises from article VI, section 1 of the Hawai‘i Constitution
 which "grants courts the power to take steps necessary for the
 promotion of justice[.]" State v. Mageo, 78 Hawai‘i 33, 37, 889
 
P.2d 1092, 1096 (App. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted)
 (citing State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 647 P.2d 705 (1982)). 
"[U]nder this aspect of the judicial power, trial courts have the
 
7
  power to dismiss sua sponte an indictment with prejudice and over
 
the objection of the prosecuting attorney[ ] [w]ithin the bounds
 of duly exercised discretion[.] The parameters within which this
 discretion is properly exercised requires a balancing [of] the
 interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a defendant
 with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court
 system." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A
 
serious threat to the integrity of the judicial process, clear
 denial of due process, evidence some constitutional right has
 been violated, arbitrary action, or governmental misconduct
 justifies use of such power. State v. Alvey, 67 Haw. 49 at 57,
 
678 P.2d 5, 10 (1984). However, such supervisory power to
 dismiss a charge is not so broad as to allow dismissal prior to a
 first trial or "just to ease a crowded docket." Id. at 57, 678
 
P.2d at 10-11. 
In dismissing the charge against Ho, the District Court
 
accepted Ho's argument that HRPP Rule 48 had been violated, Ho's
 drvier's license was administratively revoked and an ignition
 interlock device placed on her vehicle, and that according to the
 court's practice, if the case was transferred to another
 courtroom it would have been dismissed instead of continued a
 second time at the State's request. 
Ho's case was heard by the presiding district court
 
judge on February 13, 2014 which granted the State a continuance
 and trial was re-set for March 12, 2014. [JTr doc. 12 at 6-7]
 
Ho does not claim that the presiding judge on February 13, 2014
 could not have grant a continuance and re-set the trial date. In
 resetting the trial date, the presiding district court judge
 stated that it would set a trial date in order to comply with
 
8
 HRPP Rule 48, which expired on March 6, 2014. [JTr doc. 12 at 5]
 
Due to a scheduling conflict with Ho's counsel, Ho opted to have
 
trial set for March 12, 2014 and waived her rights under HRPP
 Rule 48. [JTr doc. 12 at 6] When Ho appeared for trial on March
 
12, 2014, the State stated that it was ready to proceed. There
 was no violation of HRPP Rule 48 on March 12, 2014. 
The District Court did not order the revocation of Ho's
 
driver's license and installation of an ignition interlock system
 on her vehicle. The Administrative Revocation Program, which
 allows for revocation of Ho's license and installation of an
 ignition interlock device is authorized pursuant to HRS § 291E-31
 and 291E-44.5. Any punishment as a result of an OVUII conviction
 is not in addition to the "nonpunitive and purely remedial"
 consequences of the Administrative Revocation Program. State v.
 
Toyomura, 80 Hawai‘i 8, 23, 904 P.2d 893, 908 (1995). 
Therefore, Ho was not subject to multiple possible punishments. 
Id. 
There was no evidence of a serious threat to the
 
intergrity of the judicial process, that some constitutional
 right had been violated, arbitrary action, or governmental
 misconduct in this case. Therefore, a dismissal of the charge by
 the District Court under these circumstances was an abuse of
 discretion. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, filed on March 12, 2014 in the District Court of
 
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division is vacated and the case is
 remanded for proceedings consistent with this disposition.
