IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CARMEN ETHEL ROLLISON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(1DTA-13-03061)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Carmen Ethel Rollison (Rollison)
 
appeals from the March 17, 2014 Judgment entered by the District
 
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1
 
Rollison was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under the
 
Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2014).
 
On appeal, Rollison contends the District Court erred
 
by (1) incorporating her pretrial motion to suppress into the
 trial over her objection, (2) conducting a hearing on pretrial
 motions on the same day as trial, (3) depriving her of the right
 to transcripts of pretrial motions, (4) denying her motion to
 suppress her breath test for lack of a warrant, (5) denying her
 motion to dismiss for failure to be advised of the right to
 counsel pursuant to HRS ยง 803-9, (6) denying her motion to
 dismiss because the complaint was fatally defective for failing
 to define the term "alcohol," (7), failing to find a Brady
 violation when the State demanded payment as a condition to

inspect discovery, (8) admitting the sworn statements of an
 
intoxilyzer supervisor without providing her with the opportunity
 to confront the witness, and (9) taking judicial notice that the
 intoxilyzer's accuracy verification process and approval of the
 internal standards accuracy verification.
 
The State concedes that the District Court erred by
 
failing to hold a separate hearing on Rollison's motion to
 suppress prior to trial.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Rollison's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Rollison claims the District Court erred by 
incorporating testimony on her pretrial motion to suppress into the trial over her objection. The State concedes that this was reversible error under State v. Thomas, 72 Haw. 48, 805 P.2d 1212 (1991). "[A] motion to suppress made before trial shall be determined before trial." Rule 12(e) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP). "[F]ailure to decide a motion to suppress prior to trial constitutes reversible error." Thomas, 
72 Haw. at 53, 805 P.2d at 1214 (citing State v. Rodgers, 70 Haw. 156, 776 P.2d 675 (1988)). "The only occasion where a court need not decide a motion to suppress prior to trial is where the parties agree to consolidate the hearing on the motion with trial pursuant to our holding in State v. Doyle, 64 Haw. 229, 638 P.2d 332 (1981)." Id. Rollison filed her Motion to Suppress on 
November 4, 2013, prior to the start of her trial on January 6, 2014. Rollison objected to incorporation of testimony for pretrial motions into trial. Therefore, the District Court erred by failing to determine Rollison's motions to suppress prior to trial which constituted reversible error. 
(2) The District Court did not err by conducting a 
hearing on pretrial motions on the same day as trial. Rollison cites the plain language of HRPP Rule 12(e) which states "A motion made before trial shall be determined before trial unless the court orders that it be deferred for determination at the trial of the general issue or until after verdict; . . . " However, in Thomas, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court stated that a 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing immediately prior to the start of trial arguably complied
 
with the requirement that a motion be determined before trial
 pursuant to HRPP Rule 12(e). Id. at 54, 805 P.2d at 1214. The
 
plain language of HRPP Rule 12(e) only requires that a pretrial
 motion be determined prior to trial, it does not require that
 pretrial motions be determined on a different day prior to trial.
 
(3) Rollison contends that her due process rights were
 
violated because she was denied the ability to obtain transcripts
 of testimony from pretrial motions when the motions were heard
 contemporaneously with trial. As noted above, the District Court
 erred by failing to determine the motion to suppress prior to
 trial. Therefore, the point is moot.
 
(4) Rollison contends that the District Court erred by
 
denying her motion to suppress because the State failed to obtain
 a warrant for her breath sample and relied solely upon her
 implied consent. Contrary to Rollison's claim, the State
 obtained Rollison's express written consent to provide a breath
 sample when she signed the "Use of Intoxicants While Operating A
 Vehicle Implied Consent For Testing" form on July 6, 2013. In
 the form, Rollison acknowledged, among other things, that she
 could refuse to take a breath or blood test and that none would
 be given, and she agreed to take a breath test. There is no
 evidence to demonstrate that Rollison withdrew her consent prior
 to providing a breath sample. Therefore, the State was not
 required to obtain a warrant for her breath sample.
 
(5) The District Court did not err by denying a motion 
to dismiss for Rollison's failure to be advised of the right to counsel, pursuant ot HRS ยง 803-9. State v. Won, 134 Hawai
'i 59, 
74, 332 P.3d 661, 676 (App. 2014), cert. granted SCWC-12-0000858 (Jun. 24, 2014). 
(6) The District Court did not err by denying
 
Rollison's motion to dismiss because the compliant was not
 fatally defective for failing to define the term "alcohol." 
State v. Turping, CAAP-13-0002957 2015 WL 792715 at *6 (App.
 Feb. 25, 2015), cert denied, SCWC-13-0002957 (May 20, 2015).
 
(7) Rollison contends that the District Court erred in
 
failing to find a Brady violation when the State demanded payment
 as a condition to inspect discovery. In denying Rollison's
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion to dismiss on Brady grounds, the District Court found that
 
there was no Brady violation because the State timely made
 discovery available, but Rollison refused to pay for copying
 costs.
 
We note that the State cites no authority for the
 
proposition that it may condition the disclosure of Brady
 materials, or discovery in general, on the defendant paying
 copying costs. While it may be permissible for the State to
 charge a defendant for copying costs where the defendant requests
 copies of materials subject to disclosure, the State cannot
 condition the disclosure of Brady material or discovery on the
 payment for copies that the defendant does not want. See HRPP
 
Rule 16(e)(1) (providing that the parties may perform their
 obligations of disclosure in any manner mutually agreed upon or
 by notifying the attorney for the other party that discovery
 materials may be "inspected, obtained, tested, copied or
 photographed at specified reasonable times and places"). Thus,
 the District Court erred to the extent that it found no Brady
 violation because Rollison refused to pay for copying costs.
 
On the other hand, discovery under HRPP Rule 16 is
 
2
subject to the trial court's discretion in non-felony cases,  and
Rollison's motion to dismiss was based solely on the theory that
 he was entitled to Brady material. Relying on State ex rel
 Marsland v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304, 314, 788 P.2d 1281, 1286 (1990),
 Rollison argued below that the State was required to provide "the
 relevant waiver forms, Intoxilyzer and/or blood test results,
 operational checklists, witness statements, and maintenance
 logs," without submitting a written request for disclosure or
 motion to compel discovery. However, Ames did not decide these
 items were required to be disclosed under Brady v. Maryland, 373
 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).

 HRPP Rule 16 "is limited to cases in which the defendant is
 
charged with a felony" except that "[u]pon a showing of materiality and if the
request is reasonable, the court in its discretion may require disclosure as
provided for in this Rule 16 in cases other than those in which the defendant
is charged with a felony[.]" HRPP Rule 16(a) and (d).

We now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of
evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due
process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to

Moreover, Rollison did not take steps to ensure that
 
the contested materials were included in the record on appeal. 
Accordingly, this court has no basis on which to determine
 whether they qualify as Brady material. On remand, the District
 Court should determine whether Rollison is entitled to disclosure
 of any challenged material under Brady and the extent to which
 Rollison is entitled to discovery under HRPP Rule 16(d).
 
(8) The District Court did not err by admitting the 
sworn statements of an intoxilyzer supervisor because the admission of the exhibits did not violate Rollison's right to confrontation. State v. West, 135 Hawai
'i 406, 353 P.3d 409, 
CAAP-12-0000717 2015 WL 3422156 at *3-4 (App. May 27, 2015) (SDO), cert. denied SCWC-12-0000717 (Oct. 9, 2015). 
(9) The District Court did not err by taking judicial
 
notice of the intoxilyzer's accuracy verification process and
 approval of the internal standards accuracy verification. Id. at
 
*2-3.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the March 17, 2014 Judgment
 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial
 consistent with this disposition.

Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. Subsequently, the Court included impeachment evidence
within the Brady rule. United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985) ("In
the present case, the prosecutor failed to disclose evidence that the defense
might have used to impeach the Government's witnesses by showing bias or
interest. Impeachment evidence, however, as well as exculpatory evidence,
falls within the Brady rule.")
