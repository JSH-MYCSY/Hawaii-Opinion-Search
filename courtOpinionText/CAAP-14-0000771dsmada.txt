APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 30
 
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) The statement of jurisdiction was due on June 9,
 
2014, and the opening brief was due on July 9, 2014.
 
(2) Defendant-Appellant Lori Ann Canite (Appellant) 
failed to file either document, and on July 28, 2014, the appellate clerk informed Appellant that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 30, the 
matter would be called to the court's attention on August 7, 2014, for such action as the court deemed proper, which could include dismissal.

(3) On August 6, 2014, Appellant filed a motion for
 
relief from default and to extend the time to file the statement
 
of jurisdiction and opening brief.
 
(4) On August 7, 2014, Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of
 
America, N.A. (Appellee) filed an opposition to Appellee's
 
August 6, 2014 motion, arguing that the court should deny it
 
where the appeal is either premature or moot because Appellant
 seeks to challenge a deficiency judgment and no such judgment has
 been entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
 
(5) On September 10, 2014, this court issued an order
 
to Appellant to file a reply to the Appellee's opposition within
 five (5) days of the date of the order. 
(6) Thereafter, Appellant did not file a reply to
 
Appellee's opposition. 
Under these circumstances, Appellant has not
 
demonstrated that Appellant is entitled to relief from default
 for failing to timely file the statement of jurisdiction or
 opening brief. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal
 is dismissed.
