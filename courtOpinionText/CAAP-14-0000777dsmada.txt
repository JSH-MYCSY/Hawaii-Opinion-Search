 2014 and the opening brief was due on July 9, 2014.
 
(2) Thereafter, Defendant-Appellant Orlando K. Stevens-
Nahiwa (Appellant), pro se, failed to file said documents, and on 
July 28, 2013, the appellate clerk informed Appellant that the 
time to file the documents had expired, and pursuant to Hawai
