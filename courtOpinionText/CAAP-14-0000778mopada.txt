APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants/Appellants/
 
Cross-Appellees Spencer James Bevill, Nancy Lynn Bevill, and
 
Bevill Family Trust (collectively, Bevill Appellants) appeal from
 
five interlocutory orders all entered in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
 Second Circuit (circuit court):
 
(1) the April 11, 2014 "Order Granting in Part and

 
Denying in Part [Third-Party in Interest/Appellee/
 
Cross-Appellant] Motooka & Yamamoto, A Limited Liability Law
 Company's [(Motooka)] Motion For Satisfaction of Claim of Lien
 
Under H.R.S. §507-81" (Order Granting/Denying Motion for
Satisfaction of Lien),
 
(2) the April 17, 2014 "Order Denying [the Bevill
 
Appellants'] Motion to Compel Arbitration of Fee Dispute with
 
[Motooka] Pursuant to H.R.S. §685A" (Order Denying Motion to
Compel Arbitration),
 
(3) the August 20, 2014 "Supplemental Findings And
 
Order Granting In Part And Denying In Part [Motooka's] Motion For
 
Satisfaction Of Claim Of Lien Under H.R.S. §507-81" (August
Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part),
 
(4) the August 29, 2014 "Order Granting [Motooka's]
 
Motion to Stay Settlement Distribution Payment to [Bevill
 
Appellants] On April 11, 2014" (Order Granting Motooka's Motion
to Stay Settlement Distribution), and

Appellants'] Motion to Set Aside or Vacate the [August
 
Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part]
 [Motooka's Motion for Satisfaction of Claim]" (Order Denying
Motion to Set Aside).
 
Motooka cross-appeals from the April 11, 2014 Order
 
Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien.
I.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1 (1993 & Supp.
 
2014) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees
 
and provides that appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in
 the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS
 
1
 The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 641-1(c). Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. Because the instant case involves two civil cases that 
circuit court consolidated into a single case, it is worth noting that "consolidation for convenience pursuant to HRCP Rule 42(a) also causes the cases to merge into one for purposes of determining finality of judgment." Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 
109 Hawai
'i 8, 12, 122 P.3d 803, 807 (2005). 
In the instant case, the circuit court did not reduce
 
any of its dispositive rulings to an appealable final judgment
 pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and
 the holding in Jenkins. Therefore, the five appealed
 interlocutory orders are independently appealable only if they
 can satisfy the requirements either under an exception to the
 final judgment requirement under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b),
 HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins, or under some other
 statutory authority. The only order that is both independently
 appealable and timely appealed by the Bevill Appellants is the
 April 17, 2014 Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration.
II.
 
The April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for 
Satisfaction of Lien is not sufficiently final to satisfy the requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has, "in rare situations, 
considered an interlocutory order so effectively 'final' that [it has] exercised appellate jurisdiction over an appeal that is neither a final judgment nor has been allowed by the circuit 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court under HRS § 641-1(b)." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & 
Wright, 88 Hawai 'i 319, 321, 966 P.2d 631, 633 (1998). 
Appellate jurisdiction in these cases is exercised under the
collateral order doctrine. These interlocutory appeals are
limited to orders falling in that small class which finally
determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to,
rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied
review and too independent of the cause itself to require
that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole
case is adjudicated.
 
Id. (citations, internal quotation marks omitted and format 
altered). In order to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine, an appealed order must resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Id. at 
322, 966 P.2d at 634. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has observed 
that it "must construe the collateral order doctrine narrowly and be parsimonious in its application." Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 
Hawai
'i 157, 162, 883 P.2d 78, 83 (1994). Otherwise, "[a]llowing 
widespread appeals from collateral orders would frustrate the policy against piecemeal appeals embodied in HRS § 641-1." Id. 
The circuit court's adjudication of "[Motooka's] Motion
 
For Satisfaction of Claim of Lien Under H.R.S. §507-81" filed
 December 16, 2013 (Motooka's Motion for Satisfaction of Claim),
 
appears to be part of the circuit court's overall attempt to
 
enforce the parties' settlement agreement in a particular way,
 namely, by requiring that the parties give a portion of the
 overall settlement proceeds to the Bevill Appellants' former
 attorneys, Motooka.
2
 
The April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for
 
Satisfaction of Lien does not satisfy the first requirement of
 the collateral order doctrine, namely that the collateral order
 must conclusively determine the disputed question. In analyzing
 the appealability of "final orders" under HRS § 641-1(a) in other
 contexts, the supreme court "has defined 'final order' to mean an
 order ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
 accomplished. Consequently, an order is not final if the rights
 
2
 Under the collateral order doctrine, this court has held that,
even in the absence of a separate judgment, "an order enforcing a settlement
agreement is a collateral order which is appealable." Cook v. Surety Life
Insurance, Co., 79 Hawai' i 403, 408, 903 P.2d 708, 713 (App. 1995). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is 
retained for further action." Cho v. State, 115 Hawai 'i 373, 
383, 168 P.3d 17, 27 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974 978 (2003) ("Correlatively, an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action."). 
In the instant case, the April 11, 2014 Order
 
Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien directs
 Defendants/Appellees/Cross-Appellees Phil Schutte, Beverly
 Schutte, Bruce Blough, Mike Preiss, Connie Schnitker, Pete Hill,
 Darrell Borling, the Directors for the Association of Apartment
 Owners of Ke Nani Kai and Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/
 Appellee/Cross-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Ke
 Nani Kai, (and their respective insurers) to pay settlement
 proceeds in the amount of $1,175,000 into circuit court
 (apparently for a subsequent disbursement to the Bevill
 Appellants), but this order also acknowledged that Motooka (as
 the Bevill Appellants' former attorneys) has the right to collect
 at least $259,096.21 in attorneys' fees and costs, plus
 additional, as-yet-to-be determined attorneys' fees and costs
 that the Bevill Appellants owe to Motooka. The April 11, 2014
 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien directed
 Motooka to file an additional declaration describing the exact
 amount of attorneys' fees and costs the Bevill Appellants owed to
 Motooka. The circuit court would enter an additional order that
 would conclusively determine the exact final amount of attorneys'
 fees and costs the Bevill Appellants owed to Motooka. The circuit
 court could then deduct that amount from the $1,175,000 in
 settlement proceeds the Bevill Appellants would otherwise
 receive. The April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for
 Satisfaction of Lien does not conclusively determine the disputed
 question regarding the amount of attorneys' fees and costs that
 the Bevill Appellants owed to Motooka, and, instead, this order
 expressed the circuit court's intent to enter a future order that
 would finally determine the lingering disputed question. 
Consequently, this order does not satisfy the finality
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirement of the collateral order doctrine. Therefore, the
 
April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of
 Lien is not an independently appealable order under the
 collateral order doctrine.
 
III.
 
A second exception to the general rule requiring a 
final judgment is the Forgay doctrine that is based on the United States Supreme Court's holding in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has acknowledged the Forgay 
doctrine as allowing "an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 
Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). The Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court held it had "jurisdiction to consider appeals from judgments which require immediate execution of a command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the litigation." Id. (citations, internal quotation marks, and 
brackets omitted). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has also held that 
an order terminating a tenant's right to possess property satisfies the requirements under the Forgay doctrine even when that order does not command the immediate execution of the property: 
Here, the October 25, 2012 Confirmation Order meets
the requirements of appealability under the Forgay doctrine. 
Although the October 25, 2012 Confirmation Order does not
command the immediate execution of the property to Trustee
Lambert, the order confirms the sale to Trustee Lambert,
directs the commissioner to convey the property to Trustee
Lambert, and orders the Teisinas to surrender the property
within 30 days of the conveyance. The Confirmation Order
effectively terminates the Teisinas' rights to the property
and they will suffer irreparable injury if appellate review
is postponed until final judgment.
 
Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai 'i 457, 462, 319 P.3d 376, 381 
(2014) (emphases added).
 Assuming arguendo, the Forgay doctrine applies in this
 
case, the April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for
 
Satisfaction of Lien does not qualify for appealability because
 this order does not require immediate execution of a command that
 property be delivered to the appellants' adversary. The April
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien
 
does not set any deadline for the payment, as the Forgay doctrine
 would require. This order also does not conclusively determine
 the disputed question regarding the amount of attorneys' fees and
 costs the Bevill Appellants owe to Motooka out of the settlement
 proceeds, and, instead, this order expresses the circuit court's
 intent to enter a future order that will finally determine that
 lingering disputed question. Therefore, the April 11, 2014 Order
 Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien is not
 appealable under the Forgay doctrine.
IV.
 
HRS § 641-1(b) authorizes interlocutory appeals to the
 
this court under the following circumstances:
 
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
 allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
 
(Emphasis added.) The circuit court did not certify the April
 
11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien
 for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). 
Therefore, the April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for
 Satisfaction of Lien is not appealable under HRS § 641-1(b).
V.
 
As to the April 17, 2014 Order Denying Motion to Compel
 
Arbitration, HRS § 658A-28(a)(1) (Supp. 2014) authorizes an
 appeal from "an order denying a motion to compel arbitration[.]" 
Therefore, the April 17, 2014 Order Denying Motion to Compel
 Arbitration is an appealable order.
VI.
 
The circuit court utilized two interlocutory orders to
 
adjudicate Motooka's Motion for Satisfaction of Claim: (1) the
 April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of
 Lien, and (2) the August 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order
 Granting/Denying in Part. Under the collateral order doctrine,
 this court has held that, even in the absence of a separate
 judgment, "an order enforcing a settlement agreement is a
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
collateral order which is appealable." Cook v. Surety Life Ins., 
Co., 79 Hawai 'i 403, 408, 903 P.2d 708, 713 (App. 1995). 
The circuit court's adjudication of Motooka's Motion 
for Satisfaction of Claim appears to be part of the circuit 
court's attempt to enforce the parties' settlement agreement by requiring the parties give a portion of the overall settlement proceeds to Motooka, the Bevill Appellants' former attorneys. Motooka's Motion for Satisfaction of Claim involves the adjudication of an issue, i.e., the enforcement of a settlement agreement, that Hawai
'i appellate courts have acknowledged as 
being collateral to the merits of the case. The Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court has explained that, 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.
 
S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw.
 
480, 494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (quoting Island Holidays,
 Inc. v. Fitzgerald, 58 Haw. 552, 561, 574 P.2d 884, 890 (1978)
 (ellipsis and emphases omitted). In the instant case, the August
 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part
 was the last of the series of two orders that the circuit court
 entered for the purpose of adjudicating Motooka's Motion for
 Satisfaction of Claim, which, thus, gave finality and
 appealability under the collateral order doctrine to both orders. 
Under HRS § 641-1(a), the collateral order doctrine, and the
 holding in S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, the August 20, 2014
 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part is an
 appealable final order.
 
A "notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after 
entry of the judgment or appealable order." Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). The Bevill Appellants 
filed their September 12, 2014 second amended notice of appeal 
within thirty days after entry of the August 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part. However, the Bevill Appellants utilized an "amended" notice of appeal in their attempt to obtain appellate review of the August 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in 
Part. "[A]n amended notice of appeal relates back to the notice of appeal it purports to amend, it does not appeal an order, judgment, or decree entered subsequent to the notice of appeal it purports to amend." Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 80 
Hawai
'i 345, 355-56, 910 P.2d 116, 126-27 (1996) (quoting Chan v. 
Chan, 7 Haw. App. 122, 129, 748 P.2d 807, 811 (1987)). Consequently, the Bevill Appellants' September 12, 2014 second amended notice of appeal relates back to the date of their original April 22, 2014 notice of appeal, which they filed before the entry of the August 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part. Therefore, the Bevill Appellants' original notice of appeal and subsequent amended notice of appeal were premature under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) as to the August 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part.
 Regarding a premature notice of appeal, "[i]f a notice
 
of appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before
 entry of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered
 as filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes
 final for the purpose of appeal." HRAP Rule 4(a)(2). We can
 find no record of an oral announcement of the circuit court's
 decision, later reflected in the subsequent August 20, 2014
 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part, prior
 to the filing of the Bevill Appellants April 22, 2014 notice of
 appeal. Therefore, HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) did not authorize the
 Bevill Appellants' premature notice of appeal from the August 20,
 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in Part.
 
The combination of the April 11, 2014 Order
 
Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien and the August
 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and the Order Granting/Denying in
 Part constitutes a final and appealable series of orders under
 HRS § 641-1(a) and the collateral order doctrine. However, for
 the purpose of attempting to obtain appellate review of the April
 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien,
 and the August 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order
 Granting/Denying in Part, the Bevill Appellants' September 12,
 2014 second amended notice of appeal relates back to the
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
effective date of their original April 22, 2014 notice of appeal
 
under the holding in Enos, and, therefore, is untimely under HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(1).
3
 
VII.
 
On May 12, 2014, the circuit court entered an order
 
that, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(A), purported to find "good
 cause" for and extended the time period under HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1)
 for Motooka to file a notice of cross-appeal from the original
 deadline of May 12, 2014, until a new deadline on June 11, 2014. 
On June 10, 2014, Motooka filed a notice of cross-appeal from the
 April 11, 2014 Order Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of
 Lien. At that time, the circuit court had not yet announced its
 decision that it later expressed in the August 20, 2014
 Supplemental Findings and the Order Granting/Denying in Part. 
Therefore, Motooka's June 10, 2014 notice of cross-appeal was
 untimely under HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1), and, thus, ineffective, for
 invoking appellate jurisdiction over the April 11, 2014 Order
 Granting/Denying Motion for Satisfaction of Lien, and the August
 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings and Order Granting/Denying in
 Part.
 
VIII.
 
The August 29, 2014 Order Granting Motooka's Motion to 
Stay Settlement Distribution is a post-judgment order. "A post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto, 103 Hawai
'i at 157, 80 P.3d 
3
 Had the Appellants' September 12, 2014 filing been denominated as
a "Notice of Appeal" and not a "Second Amended Notice of Appeal," and a new
appeal thereby opened with regard to the August 20, 2014 Supplemental Findings
and Order Granting/Denying in Part, we may have acquired jurisdiction over
that appeal. As Appellants did not follow this procedure, however, we are
powerless under Enos to affect the course of their appeal. The failure to
 file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect
that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the
exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d
1127, 1129 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court of judge or justice is
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may
relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these
rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). This same
 rationale applies to limit our jurisdiction over the August 29, 2014 Order
Granting Motooka's Motion to Stay Settlement Distribution and the October 21,
2014 Order Denying Motion to Set Aside as discussed infra at sections VIII and
IX.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 978. The August 29, 2014 Order Granting Motooka's Motion to
 
Stay Settlement Distribution ended and finally determined the
 post-judgment proceedings for Motooka's motion to stay settlement
 distribution payment to the Bevill Appellants pending the Bevill
 Appellants' appeal, leaving nothing further in that particular
 motion to be determined. Therefore, the August 29, 2014 Order
 Granting Motooka's Motion to Stay Settlement Distribution is an
 appealable final post-judgment order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a).
 
The Bevill Appellants filed their September 12, 2014
 
second amended notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of
 the August 29, 2014 post-judgment Order Granting Motooka's Motion
 to Stay Settlement Distribution. However, the Bevill Appellants'
 September 12, 2014 second amended notice of appeal relates back
 to the date of their original April 22, 2014 notice of appeal,
 which they filed long before the entry of the August 29, 2014
 Order Granting Motooka's Motion to Stay Settlement Distribution. 
Therefore, the Bevill Appellants' original notice of appeal and
 subsequent amended notices of appeal were all premature under
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) as to the August 29, 2014 post-judgment Order
 Granting Motooka's Motion to Stay Settlement Distribution.
IX.
 The October 21, 2014 Order Denying Motion to Set Aside
 
is a post-judgment order. The Bevill Appellants filed their
 October 27, 2014 third amended notice of appeal within thirty
 days after entry of the October 21, 2014 Order Denying Motion to
 Set Aside and relates back to the date of the Bevill Appellants'
 original April 22, 2014 notice of appeal, which was filed long
 before the October 21, 2014 Order Denying Motion to Set Aside. 
Therefore, the Bevill Appellants' original notice of appeal and
 subsequent amended notices of appeal were premature under HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(1) as to the October 21, 2014 Order Denying Motion to
 Set Aside.
 
X.
 
Finally, we address the merits of the Bevill
 
Appellants' appeal of the April 17, 2014 Order Denying Motion to
 Compel Arbitration, the only order in this appeal over which we
 have jurisdiction. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On April 16, 2007, Bevill Appellants retained Motooka
 
and executed the firm's Retainer Agreement. The Retainer
 
Agreement contained an arbitration clause requiring any dispute
 arising from the agreement, including claims relating to fees, be
 resolved by binding arbitration at Dispute Prevention and
 Resolution, Inc. (DPR):
 
V. Dispute Resolution
 
Any controversy or claim relating to or arising out of this

agreement, or any of the subject mailers of this agreement,
which cannot be resolved informally between or among the
parties to this agreement shall be settled or resolved by a
confidential binding arbitration in Honolulu, Hawaii by a
single neutral arbitrator to be appointed by [DPR], in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules, Procedures &
Protocols of [DPR] then in effect. This includes, but is not
limited to, any controversy or claim for malpractice or
professional negligence and any other controversy or claim
relating to arising out of or relating to the fees, costs or
charges relating to services rendered hereunder. In the
event that DPR is unable, for any reason, to administer or
conduct said arbitration, the parties will submit such
controversy or claim to the American Arbitration
Association, and said arbitration shall be conducted in
Honolulu, Hawaii by a single neutral arbitrator in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
 American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment
upon the award rendered by that arbitration may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction. By agreeing to arbitrate,
you relinquish any right to have a jury trial or to litigate
in court for any controversy subject to arbitration. If you
do not understand this arbitration provision, please contact
our firm or independent counsel for further explanation.
 
The laws of the State of Hawaii shall govern the
construction, interpretation, and the performance of this
agreement; and this agreement may be changed only by an
agreement in writing signed by both parties. If legal
services are used to enforce rights under this agreement,
the prevailing party in any arbitration or legal action may
recover all the costs of such legal services, including
reasonable attorneys' fees. Our firm may also use the
services of its own attorneys to enforce rights under this
agreement, in which case we may recover the charges for
those services at regular hourly rates just as if we had
retained outside counsel
 
On January 10, 2014, the Bevill Appellants filed their
 
"Motion to Compel Arbitration of Fee Dispute with [Motooka]
 
Pursuant to [HRS] § 658A."
 
On April 17, 2014, the circuit court filed its Order
 
Denying the Bevill's Motion to Compel Arbitration, finding in
 part:
 
1. That the [Motooka] Retainer Agreement contains an
arbitration clause, which reads in relevant part, that "Any
controversy or claim relating to or arising out of this
agreement which cannot be resolved informally between or
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
among the parties to this agreement shall be settled or
resolved by a confidential binding arbitration. This
 includes any controversy or claim arising out of or relating
to the fees, costs or charges relating to services rendered
hereunder."
 
2. That under the section of the Retainer Agreement
describing the responsibilities of the client, the agreement
further states that "Any questions, comments, or objections
to our statements must be brought to our attention in
writing within thirty (30) days from the date of the
invoice, or shall otherwise be deemed acceptable by you."
 
3. That [Motooka] never received such a written
statement from the [Bevill Appellants] until [the Bevill
Appellants] filed the instant motion on January 10, 2014,
and as such, the [Bevill Appellants] have waived their right
to raise a fee dispute, and therefore, no controversy or
claim in the spirit of the Retainer Agreement exists.
 
4. That under [HRS §] 658-7, there is no enforceable
agreement to arbitrate, and, as such, under [HRS §]
658-7(2)(c), the Court shall not order the parties to
arbitrate.

The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has acknowledged the "policy 
[of] encouraging arbitration and thereby discouraging 
litigation." United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646 v. Dawson 
Int'l, Inc., 113 Hawai 'i 127, 137, 149 P.3d 495, 505 (2006) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In Hawai 'i, 
parties can contractually bind themselves to submit their disputes to alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Agreements to 
submit disputes to ADR are binding, enforceable and may be 
compelled by the court under HRS § 658A-7 (Supp. 2014). When presented with the question of whether a dispute should be conducted in arbitration versus litigated, the circuit court is limited to addressing two threshold questions: (1) whether an arbitration agreement exists; and (2) if yes, whether the subject matter of the dispute can be arbitrated. Koolau Radiology, Inc. 
v. The Queen's Medical Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 445, 834 P.2d 1294,
 1300 (1992) (based on HRS chapter 658, the predecessor to HRS
 chapter 658A, the currently-applicable Uniform Arbitration Act).
 
In this case, the existence of the arbitration
 
agreement in the Retainer Agreement between the parties was
 undisputed. The Retainer Agreement was the standard form used by
 Motooka. The subject matter of the dispute was arbitrable. 
Motooka asserted that it was owed alleged attorneys' fees and
 
13

costs. The Bevill Appellants disputed the amounts that Motooka
 
alleged was owed. Because an arbitration agreement existed and
 the claims raised by Motooka were arbitrable, the circuit court
 erred when it refused to enforce the arbitration clause contained
 in the Retainer Agreement.
 
The circuit court's April 17, 2014 Order Denying Motion
 
to Compel Arbitration found that the Bevill Appellants were
 required to object to any invoices within thirty days and that
 Motooka never received any such objection until the filing of the
 Bevill's Motion to Compel Arbitration on January 10, 2014 and
 therefore, no controversy or claim in the Retainer Agreement
 existed. The thirty-day objection provision cited by the circuit
 court was contained in a section of the Retainer Agreement
 separate and apart from the arbitration section. The arbitration
 clause refers to "[a]ny controversy or claim relating to or
 arising out of this agreement[.]" The Arbitration section allows
 the Bevill Appellants to arbitrate any dispute arising from their
 representation by Motooka. The thirty-day provision refers to
 billing statements. Motooka would be free to raise the
 thirty-day provision as an issue at arbitration and both parties
 would be able to present evidence of the communications between
 the parties regarding billing statements. The circuit court
 erred in finding the thirty-day provision was a condition
 precedent to the Bevill Appellants' ability to arbitrate the
 disputed amount of attorneys' fees and costs that Motooka claimed
 as due.
