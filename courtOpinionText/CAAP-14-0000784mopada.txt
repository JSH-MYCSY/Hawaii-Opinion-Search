 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo presided. 1
2Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed on 01/22/2014
(Judgment), entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
(Circuit Court).1 
I.BACKGROUND
This case involves a property located on Wainee Street,
in Lahaina, Maui, Hawai# i 96761 ( Property).  On September 16,
2005, Warren executed a promissory note ( Note) to U.S. Financial
Mortgage Corp., a Hawaii Corporation (U.S. Financial) in the
amount of $640,000.00.  The Note was secured by the mortgage
(Mortgage) on the Property.  Mortgage Electronic Registration
Systems, Inc. ( MERS) was listed in the Mortgage as "mortgagee"
and "nominee."  The Mortgage was filed with the State of Hawai #i
Bureau of Conveyances on September 23, 2005.  
On February 17, 2011, MERS, as nominee for U.S.
Financial, executed an Assignment of Mortgage.  The Assignment of
Mortgage granted, assigned, and transferred to BNYM "all
mortgagee interest under that certain Mortgage dated 9/16/2005,
executed by Warren Eugene Blye and Judy Casey Blye, Husband and
Wife, as Tenants by the Entirety, mortgagor[.]" 
On May 14, 2013, BNYM filed a Complaint for Mortgage
Foreclosure ( Complaint).  In the Complaint, BNYM alleged that
Appellants' failure to make scheduled payments "represents a
default of the repayment terms under the Mortgage and Note."  
BNYM contended that it is "entitled to a foreclosure of its
Mortgage and to a sale of the Property in accordance with the
terms of the Mortgage."  Copies of the Note, Mortgage, and NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Assignment of Mortgage are attached to the Complaint. The Note
 
includes an endorsement from U.S. Financial to Countrywide Bank,
 N.A., followed by an endorsement from Countrywide Bank, N.A. to
 Countrywide Home Loans Inc., and another endorsement from
 Countrywide Home Loans Inc., in blank. 
On July 30, 2013, Appellants filed an Answer to the
 
Complaint. Appellants did not assert any claims or affirmative
 defenses in their Answer. 
On January 22, 2014, BNYM filed a motion for summary
 
judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure (Motion for
 
Summary Judgment). Copies of the Note, Mortgage, Assignment of
 Mortgage, Notice of Intent to Accelerate, and loan history were
 
attached to the Motion for Summary Judgment. BNYM also submitted
 a declaration of Melissa Black (Black), an Assistant Vice
 
President for Residential Credit Solutions, Inc., the servicing
 
agent for BNYM. Black declared under penalty of perjury, inter
 
alia, that Warren "defaulted in the performance of the terms set
 
forth in the Note and Mortgage by failing to pay the principal,
 interest, and advances", and she attested to the "true and
 correct cop[ies]" of the loan documents, which were kept as part
 of the business records of BNYM's servicing agent.
 
On January 30, 2014, Appellants filed a joint 
Declaration in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment. Appellants asserted that "pursuant to Rule 6, Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, they were not given sufficient time to respond to the Motion, which is scheduled to be heard on February 11, 2014[.]" Appellants requested a continuance under Hawai
'i Rules 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f) to conduct discovery on (1)
 
"[w]hether or not [BNYM] has the original Note and Mortgage," (2)
 
"[w]hether or not [BNYM] was paid on the Note by their
 reinsurance company 60 days after the Note went into default,"
 and (3) "[w]hether or not [BNYM] used 'tainted' funds to fund the
 Mortgage." 
The Circuit Court held a hearing on the Motion for
 
Summary Judgment on February 11, 2014. BNYM requested that the
 court grant its Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Bank of
 Honolulu N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 654 P.2d 1370 (1982). 
Warren requested a sixty-day continuance to determine whether the
 sale of the Note and Mortgage was fraudulent. The Circuit Court
 granted the Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
On March 27, 2014, the Circuit Court entered its
 
Judgment, and Findings of Fact (FOF), Conclusions of Law (COL)
 
and Order granting BNYM's Motion for Summary Judgment, which
 
included the following:
 
[FOF 5]:  [BNYM] is the owner and holder of the Note
and Mortgage by virtue of that certain Assignment of

Mortgage dated 2/17/2011, recorded in the Bureau on
6/24/2011, as Document No.2011-099465 ("Assignment"). The
 Note, Mortgage, and Assignment are collectively referred to
as the "Loan Documents." 
. . . . 

[FOF 8]:  Defendant Warren Blye is in default under the

terms of the Loan Documents in that he breached the covenant
 to make the payments as required under the terms of the
Note.
 
. . . . 

[FOF 11]:  By reason of said default, [BNYM] is

entitled to foreclose upon the Property in accordance with
the terms and conditions provided in the Loan Documents. 
. . . . 

[COL 4]: [BNYM] is the holder of the Note and Mortgage

and is entitled to enforce them. [BNYM] qualifies as the
 
4

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Note holder with standing to prosecute the instant action as
the Note is endorsed in blank, thereby converting the Note
to a bearer instrument, and because [BNYM] is currently in
rightful possession of the endorsed note. 
[COL 5]:
 On 2/27/2011, the aforementioned Note and
Mortgage were validly assigned to [BNYM] by virtue of an
Assignment recorded in the Bureau on 6/24/2011 as Document
No.2011-099465. 
. . . . 

[COL 7]:  [BNYM] is entitled to the entry of summary
judgment and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure against
Defendants Warren Eugene Blye; Judy Casey Blye; American
Savings Bank, F.S.B.; Discover Bank; Jeffrey L. Uldricks;
Troy Capital, LLC; John Does 1-20; Jane Does 1-20; Doe
Corporations 1-20; Doe Entities 1-20; And Doe Governmental
Units 1-20, in the foreclosure action, on the grounds that
no genuine issue of material fact exists, and [BNYM] is
entitled to summary judgment and an interlocutory decree of
foreclosure as a matter of law. 
On April 28, 2014, Appellants filed their notice of
 
appeal. 
II. POINTS OF ERROR 

Appellants raise nine points of error, contending that
 
the Circuit Court erred in: 
(1) finding that "[BNYM] is the owner and holder of the
 
Note and Mortgage by virtue of that certain Assignment of
 Mortgage dated 2/17/2011, recorded in the Bureau on 6/24/2011, as
 Document No. 2011-099465" in FOF 5;
 
(2) finding that "[BNYM] is entitled to foreclosure
 
upon the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions
 provided in the Loan Documents" in FOF 11;
 
(3) concluding that "[BNYM] is the holder of the Note
 
and Mortgage and entitled to enforce them" in COL 4;
 
(4) concluding that "[BNYM] qualifies as the Note
 
holder with standing to prosecute the instant action" in COL 4;
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(5) concluding that the "Note and Mortgage were validly
 
assigned to [BNYM] by virtue of an Assignment recorded in the
 
Bureau on 6/24/2011 as Document No. 2011-099465" in COL 5;
 
(6) concluding that no genuine issue of material fact
 
exists, and BNYM is entitled to summary judgment and an
 interlocutory decree of foreclosure as a matter of law in COL 7;
 
(7) failing to consider Appellants' Declaration in
 
Opposition in its decision to grant BNYM's Motion for Summary
 Judgment;
 
(8) not granting a continuance to Appellants; and
 (9) entering its Judgment. 
We distill these points of error into four contentions:
 
(1) that the Circuit Court erred when it granted BNYM's Motion

 
for Summary Judgment because genuine issues of material fact
 remained in dispute; (2) that the Circuit Court abused its
 discretion when it denied Appellants' request for a continuance
 under HRCP Rule 56(f); (3) that the Circuit Court erred when it
 failed to consider Appellants' Declaration in Opposition in its
 decision to grant BNYM's Motion for Summary Judgment and deny
 Appellants' request for a continuance; and (4) that the Circuit
 Court erred when it entered its Judgment. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW

 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. See  State ex rel. Anzai v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 99 Hawai' i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433,
[440] (2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai' i 
243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,

depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

90 P.3d 233, 236 (2004) (citation omitted).

"A trial court's decision to deny a request for a
continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f) will not be reversed
absent an abuse of discretion." Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 128
Hawai'i 53, 67, 283 P.3d 60, 74 (2012) (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted).
 
[T]he request must demonstrate how postponement of a
ruling on the motion will enable him or her, by
discovery or other means, to rebut the movants'
showing of absence of a genuine issue of fact. An
abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has
 clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Summary Judgment
 
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the "burden
 
is on the party moving for summary judgment (moving party) to
 show the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts,
 which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitles
 the moving party to judgment as a matter of law." Pioneer Mill
 Co., Ltd. v. Dow, 90 Hawai
'i 289, 295, 978 P.2d 727, 733 (1999) 
(citation omitted). "If the moving party meets its burden of
 production, the non-moving party must present admissible evidence
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
showing specific facts about essential elements of each claim to
 
avoid summary judgment." Tanaka v. Santiago, No. CAAP-13­
0000014, 2014 WL 3512986, at *1 (Haw. App. July 16, 2014) (mem.
 op) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23
 (1986)). 
To be entitled to summary judgment in a foreclosure
 
action, the movant must prove: (1) the existence of the
 agreement, (2) the terms of the agreement, (3) default under the
 terms of the agreement, and (4) notice of default was provided. 
Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw. App. 545, 551, 654
 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982). 
In the instant case, BNYM presented copies of: (1) the
 
Note by which Appellants promised to pay U.S. Financial Corp
 $640,000.00; (2) the Mortgage that Appellants executed with U.S.
 Financial Corp; (3) a notice of intent to accelerate dated April
 16, 2010, which notified Appellants of their default under the
 terms of the Note and Mortgage; and (4) the loan history. BNYM
 also submitted Black's declaration stating, inter alia, that
 Warren "defaulted in the performance of the terms set forth in
 the Note and Mortgage, by failing to pay the principal, interest,
 and advances[.]" Accordingly, BNYM established the existence and
 terms of the Note and Mortgage, that Appellants defaulted under
 the terms of the Note and Mortgage, and that Appellants were
 provided notice of their default. As BNYM satisfied its initial
 burden of production, the burden shifted to Appellants to "set
 forth specific facts, as opposed to mere allegations, that there
 was a genuine issue for trial." Bank of America, N.A. v. Hill,
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
No. CAAP-13-0000035, 2015 WL 6739087, at *5 (Haw. App. Oct. 30,
 
2015) (mem. op). 
Appellants argue that there are two genuine issues of
 
material fact, (1) whether BNYM is the holder of the Note; and
 (2) whether the Note and Mortgage were validly assigned to BNYM. 
Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erred when it

 
granted summary judgment because the issue of whether BNYM is the
 holder of the Note remains in dispute.  BNYM contends that it
 
presented "sufficient admissible evidence in the form of the
 
sworn declaration that [BNYM] owned the Note[.]"
 
"In order to enforce a note and mortgage under Hawaii 
law, a creditor must be a 'person entitled to enforce' the note. One person entitled to enforce an instrument is a 'holder' of the instrument." U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 137 Hawai
'i 209, 211, 367 
P.3d 703, 705 (App. 2016) (citing In re Tyrell, 528 B.R. 790, 794 (Bankr. D. Haw. 2015)) cert. granted, No. SCWC-14-0001134 (Haw. June 23, 2016); see also Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 490:3­
2 3 
 301 (2008)  and HRS § 490:1-201(b) (2008).  Under HRS § 409:3-205
 
2 HRS § 490:3-301 provides: 
§490:3-301 Person entitled to enforce instrument.
"Person entitled to enforce" an instrument means (i) the
holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in possession of
the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a
person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled
to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 490:3-309 or
490:3-418(d). A person may be a person entitled to enforce
the instrument even though the person is not the owner of
the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the
instrument. 
3
 HRS § 490:1-201(b) states in relevant part: 
"Holder" means: 
(1) The person in possession of a negotiable instrument
that is payable either to bearer or to an identified
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2008),4
 "the bearer of an instrument endorsed in blank becomes
the holder of that instrument." Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys.
 
v. Wise, No. CAAP-11-0000444, 2012 WL 5971062, at *1 (Haw. App.
 
Nov. 29, 2012) (SDO). This court has recognized that "a trial
 court does not err in finding that a plaintiff is the holder of
 the note when the plaintiff bears the note, a blank endorsement
 establishes that the plaintiff is the holder of the note, and
 there is a declaration stating that the note is a true and
 accurate copy of the note in the plaintiff's possession." Wells
 
Fargo, N.A. v. Pasion, No. CAAP-12-0000657, 2015 WL 4067259, at
 *3 (Haw. App. June 30, 2015) (SDO), cert. denied, 2015 WL 5965895
 (Haw. Oct. 13, 2015). 
In order to establish that it was entitled to enforce
 
the Note, BNYM attached Black's declaration, the Note, Mortgage,

 
and Assignment of Mortgage.  The Note included an endorsement
 
3(...continued)
person that is the person in possession; 

(2) 	The person in possession of a negotiable tangible
document of title if the goods are deliverable either
to bearer or to the order of the person in possession;
or
 
(3) 	The person in control of a negotiable electronic
document of title. 
HRS § 490:3-205 states in relevant part:
 
4	 §490:3–205 Special indorsement; blank indorsement; anomalous
indorsement. (a) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an
instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to
bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes
the instrument payable, it is a "special indorsement". When
specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the
identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of
that person. . . . 
(b) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an
instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a
"blank indorsement". When indorsed in blank, an instrument
becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer
of possession alone until specially indorsed.
 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from U.S. Financial to Countrywide Bank, N.A., followed by an
 
endorsement from Countrywide Bank, N.A. to Countrywide Home Loans
 Inc., and another indorsement from Countrywide Home Loans Inc.,
 in blank. In her declaration, Black declared that the Note was a
 
true and accurate copy of the Note in BNYM's possession. BNYM
 
presented evidence that it "possessed the Note, the blank
 endorsement established that [BNYM] could possess the note, and
 the motion for summary judgment attached a declaration
 establishing that the Note was a true and accurate copy of the
 note in [BNYM's] possession." Pasion, 2015 WL 4067259, at *3. 
Thus, BNYM produced sufficient evidence that it was the "holder"
 of the Note and entitled to enforce the Note under HRS § 490:3­301. Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, No. CAAP-15-0000005,
 
2016 WL 1092305, at *3 (Haw. App. Mar. 16, 2016) (SDO) cert.
 granted, No. SCWC-15-0000005 (Haw. June 22, 2016). Appellants
 did not present any evidence to contradict BNYM's showing that it
 was the holder of the note, and therefore, did not raise a
 genuine issue of material fact. See Hill, 2015 WL 6739087, at
 *5. 
Appellants further argue that the Circuit Court erred
 
when it granted summary judgment because the issue of whether the
 Note and Mortgage were validly assigned to BNYM remains in
 dispute. In particular, Appellants contend that "the note has no
 provision regarding transfer or assignment giving Lender or MERS
 authority to transfer the Note without Borrower's prior
 knowledge." BNYM contends that a "Note that has been endorsed in
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
blank is negotiated by delivering possession of the Note, not by
 
assignment."
 
In Pasion, this court rejected a challenge to "the
 
ability of the mortgagee, MERS, to assign the Mortgage or the
 Note[.]" Pasion, 2015 WL 4067259, at *3. This jurisdiction has
 
recognized that when the "plain language of a mortgage
 establishes MERS as a nominee permitted to take action on behalf
 of the lender, it has 'the authority to take any action required
 of the lender, including assigning the mortgage.'" Id. (quoting
 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Yamamoto, No. CAAP-11-0000728, 2012 WL
 6178303, at *1 (Haw. App. Dec. 11, 2012) (SDO)) (brackets
 omitted); see also Bank of New York Mellon v. Rumbawa, No. CAAP­15-0000024, 2016 WL 482170, at *3 (Haw. App. Feb. 4, 2016) (SDO).
 
Here, MERS was listed in the Mortgage as "mortgagee"
 
and "nominee." Appellants mortgaged, granted, and conveyed the
 property to "MERS (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender's
 successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of
 MERS, with power of sale[.]" The terms of the Mortgage granted
 MERS the right "to exercise any or all of those interests,
 including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell
 the property; and to take action required by Lender including,
 but not limited to, releasing and canceling this Security
 Instrument." This court has held that mortgages with nearly
 identical language "have empowered MERS to take any action,
 including assigning the loan." Rumbawa, 2016 WL 482170, at *3. 
We reach the same conclusion in this case. Thus, we conclude 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
13that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether
MERS had the authority to assign the Note and Mortgage to BNYM. 
B.HRCP Rule 56(f) Continuance
Appellants argue that the Circuit Court abused its
discretion when it denied Appellants' request for a continuance. 
BNYM asserts that "Appellants did not meet their burden to be
entitled to a continuance to conduct discovery." 
HRCP Rule 56(f) states:
Should it appear from the affidavits of a party
opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated
present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's
opposition, the court may refuse the application for
judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to
be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be
had or may make such other order as is just.
"A trial court's decision to deny a request for a
continuance pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f) will not be reversed
absent an abuse of discretion."  Salvacion, 134 Hawai# i at 172,
338 P.3d at 1187 (citing Kaleikini , 128 Hawai #i at 67, 283 P.3d
at 74).  A request for a continuance "must demonstrate how
postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable the moving
party, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing
of absence of a genuine issue of fact."  Id. at 176, 338 P.3d at
1191 (citation omitted).  A party requesting a continuance is
"required to show what specific facts further discovery might
unveil."  Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &
Co., 116 Hawai #i 277, 308, 172 P.3d 1021, 1052 (2007) (quoting
McCabe v. Macaulay , 450 F. Supp. 2d 928, 933 (N.D. Iowa 2006)). 
Additionally: 
To prevail under [FRCP Rule 56(f)], parties opposing a
motion for summary judgment must make (a) a timely
application which (b) specifically identifies (c) relevant
information, (d) where there is some basis for believingNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the information sought actually exists. The burden is
on the party seeking additional discovery to proffer
sufficient facts to show that the evidence sought exists,
and that it would prevent summary judgment.
 
Hill, 2015 WL 6739087, at *10 (quoting Emp'rs Teamsters Local
 
Nos. 175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund v. Clorox Co., 353 F.3d 1125,
 1129–30 (9th Cir. 2004)). 
In their Declaration in Opposition to BNYM's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment, Appellants requested a continuance under HRCP
 Rule 56(f) to conduct discovery on whether or not BNYM: has the
 original Note and Mortgage; was paid on the Note by their
 reinsurance company sixty days after the Note went into default;
 and used "tainted" funds to fund the Mortgage. On appeal,
 Appellants clarify and contend that their request for a
 continuance was to obtain "essential facts" needed to support
 their legal theories about: (1) BNYM's standing to enforce the
 Note; and (2) fraud and illegal activity resulting in their
 default. As discussed, BNYM established that it was the holder
 of the Note and entitled to enforce the Mortgage. Reyes-Toledo,
 2016 WL 1092305, at *3. Additionally, Appellants have not pled
 or provided any facts to support their contention that their
 default was caused by fraud and illegal activity. Appellants'
 allegations that fraud and illegal activity caused their default
 "appears to be based on pure speculation." Hill, 2015 WL
 
6739087, at *10. Appellants have provided no "plausible basis"
 
for their claims that further discovery was necessary to
 
establish that their default was due to fraud and illegal
 activity. Id. Therefore, Appellants failed to demonstrate how
 
postponement of a ruling on the motion would have enabled them,
 
14
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
by discovery or other means, to rebut BNYM's showing of absence 
of a genuine issue of fact. See Assocs. Fin. Serv. of Haw., 99 
Hawai'i at 454, 56 P.3d at 756. Under these circumstances, the 
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Appellants' request for a continuance under HRCP Rule 56(f). Salvacion, 134 Hawai

Kaleikini, 128 Hawai 'i at 67, 283 P.3d at 74). 
C. Failure to Consider Declaration in Opposition
 Appellants argue that the Circuit Court failed to
 
consider their Declaration in Opposition in conjunction with its
 decision to grant BNYM's Motion for Summary Judgment and deny
 Appellants' request for a continuance. Appellants contend that
 the Circuit Court erred when it refused to acknowledge their
 Declaration in Opposition and required Appellants to file a
 "full-fledged opposition." 
At the beginning of the hearing on the Motion for
 
Summary Judgment, the Circuit Court asked Appellants if they had
 submitted anything in writing. Warren informed the Circuit Court
 that they filed a Declaration in Opposition on January 30, 2014. 
At the end of the hearing, the Circuit Court confirmed that
 Warren "file[d] a declaration, and that was titled, . . .
 declaration in opposition." The Circuit Court apologized and
 explained that it was "looking for a full blown -- I didn't get
 any full blown memo in opposition. There was a couple pages of
 your declaration. So thank you for that." Thus, it appears from
 the record that the Circuit Court in fact reviewed and considered
 Appellants' Declaration in Opposition. There is no support in

16the record for the proposition that the Circuit Court refused to
consider the assertions in the Declaration in Opposition, or
otherwise failed to consider Appellants' arguments against
summary judgment, based on the form of the opposition. 
Accordingly, this argument is without merit.
D.Judgment 
Finally, Appellants contend that the Circuit Court
erred when it entered its Judgment.  However, Appellants fail to
provide any discernable argument in support of their contention. 
Kakinami v. Kakinami , 127 Hawai #i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695,
713 n.16 (2012) (citing In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113
Hawai#i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (noting that this
court may "disregard a particular contention if the appellant
makes no discernible argument in support of that position")
(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).  Therefore,
this contention is not subject to review by this court. 
V.CONCLUSION
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's March 27, 2014
Judgment is affirmed.
