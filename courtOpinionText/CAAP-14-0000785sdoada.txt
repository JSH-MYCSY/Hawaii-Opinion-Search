NO. CAAP-14-0000785
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF VG
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-J NO. 0089867)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant VG (Minor), a minor, appeals from
 
the Amended Order (Order), entered on February 26, 2014, in the
 
Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).1 The Family
 
Court adjudicated Minor a law violator on one count of Robbery in
 the Second Degree (Robbery 2), in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
2
Statutes (HRS) §§ 708-841(1)(a) and/or (b) (2014),  and ordered
him to continue on probation and perform sixty hours of community
 service, among other things. On appeal, Minor argues that the
 
1
 The Honorable Paul T. Murakami presided.

 HRS § 708-841(1) provides in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of robbery in the
second degree if, in the course of committing theft . . . :
 
(a)	 The person uses force against the person of
anyone present with the intent to overcome that
person's physical resistance or physical power
of resistance;
 
(b)	 The person threatens the imminent use of force
against the person of anyone who is present with
intent to compel acquiescence to the taking of
or escaping with the property[.]
 
HRS § 708-830(1) (2014) provides that "[a] person commits theft if the person
. . . (1) [o]btains or exerts unauthorized control over property. A person
obtains or exerts unauthorized control over the property of another with
intent to deprive the other of the property."

Family Court erroneously found that he committed Robbery 2 based
 
on insufficient evidence. To support his argument, he contests
 numerous findings of fact (FOF) and conclusions of law (COL) in
 the court's "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding
 Trial on February 25, 2014."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Minor's
 appeal as follows: 
The Family Court did not err in finding that Minor
 
committed Robbery 2.
 
(1) There was substantial evidence that Minor was the
 
3
perpetrator of the offense, and COL 2, 5,  18, 19, and 20 are not
wrong. See
 HRS 708-841(1)(a) and/or (b); State v. Sua, 92 
Hawai'i 78, 98, 987 P.2d 976, 996 (App. 1999), rev'd on other 
grounds, 92 Hawai 'i 61, 987 P.2d 959 (1999); In re Doe, 107 
Hawai'i 439, 446-47, 114 P.3d 945, 952-53 (App. 2005); State v. 
Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992). 
At trial, the complaining witness (CW) testified that
 
he looked at the boy's face while the boy was pushing him and
 demanding money. The CW later identified Minor in a photographic
 lineup as the boy who pushed him and took his money. The CW
 testified that he was 100% sure of his lineup identification.
 
CW's friend (Witness) testified that, from about ten
 
feet away, he saw the boy shove the CW and take the CW's money. 
Before that, the boy had approached Witness, and they talked for
 about five minutes. Witness later identified Minor in a
 photographic lineup as the boy who shoved the CW and took his
 money. Witness was sure of his lineup identification.
 
(2) There was substantial evidence that Minor
 
committed Robbery 2. See HRS §§ 708-830 & -841(1)(a) and (b);
 
Batson, 73 Haw. at 248, 831 P.2d at 931. The CW testified that
 Minor pushed him when he was trying to walk away, "demanded"
 money from CW, and that Minor pushed him two or three times in

the chest, causing him to stumble backwards. The CW took out his
 
wallet because he was afraid, and Minor took two dollars from the
 wallet. Witness testified he saw Minor push the CW two or three
 times, demand money in a threatening tone of voice, and take
 money from the CW's wallet. We also conclude the evidence
 against Minor was not rendered insufficient by the police's
 failure to investigate another person whose name was mentioned in
 the investigation.
 
(3) Minor does not actually argue that FOF 10, 14, 15,
 
4
21, 26,  and 38 are clearly erroneous but, rather, contests the
weight the Family Court accorded them. 
The determination of the 
weight of the evidence is within the province of the trial court, and we find no basis for overturning the trial court's determination. 
See State v. Eastman
, 81 Hawai 'i 131, 139, 913 
P.2d 57, 65 (1996). 
(4) This court declines to overturn FOF 27, 28, and 40 
and COL 10-13, which are the Family Court's determinations regarding witnesses' credibility. See Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i at 
139, 913 P.2d at 65. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Amended Order,
 
entered on February 26, 2014, in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit, is affirmed.
