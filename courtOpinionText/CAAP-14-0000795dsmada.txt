(3) On July 7, 2014, the appellate clerk informed
 
Appellant that: 
(a) filing and docketing fees had not been paid,
 
and that the record cannot be prepared without payment of the
 
fees or an order allowing Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis;
 and
 
(b) pursuant to Rule 11(c)(2) of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure, the matter would be called to the attention of the court on July 17, 2014 for such action as the court deems proper, including dismissal of the appeal; and 
(4) 
Thereafter, Appellant took no further action in

 
this appeal.
