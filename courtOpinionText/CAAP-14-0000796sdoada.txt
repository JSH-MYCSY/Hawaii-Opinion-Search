IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DENTON A. SATO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(1DTA-13-04986)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Denton A. Sato (Sato) appeals from
 
the March 11, 2014 Judgment entered by the District Court of the
 
First Circuit, 'Ewa Division (District Court).1 The District 
Court convicted Sato of one count of Operating a Vehicle Under
 the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2015).
 
On appeal, Sato argues that the District Court abused
 
its discretion and violated his constitutional rights by
 admitting into evidence the results of his alcohol breath test,
 after erroneously
 
(1) 
admitting State's Exhibit 1, Sato's implied
consent form based on inter alia , his request that
the District Court determine whether his consent
 to submit to a breath test was voluntary.
 
(2) admitting State's Exhibits 2 and 3, each an
"Intoxilyzer 8000 Accuracy Test Supervisor's Sworn
Statement" (Intoxilyzer Supervisor's Accuracy
Statement), which lacked a sufficient foundation
and was hearsay;

(3) granting the State's request for judicial notice
that the Intoxilyzer 8000's Internal Standardsaccuracy verification device had been approved bythe State of Hawai
'i, Department of Health (DOH),
as indicated by a certified letter from the DOH tothe Honolulu Police Department (HPD); and 
(4) admitting State's Exhibit 4, a "Sworn Statement of
Intoxilyzer 8000 Operator" (Breath Test Result),
Sato's breath test result, which lacked a proper
foundation and was hearsay.
 
Further, Sato argues that (5) the State failed to show
 
that the alcohol he allegedly consumed was "alcohol" as defined
 
by HRS § 291E-1 (2007) and (6) the District Court erred in
 convicting him under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) in the absence of
 substantial evidence that was properly admissible.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, and in light of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's recent decision in State 
v. Won, SCWC-12-0000858 (Haw. Nov. 25, 2015) we conclude the
 evidence of Sato's breath test was improperly admitted and as
 there was no other evidence of his blood alcohol content, there
 was insufficient evidence supporting his conviction under HRS
 § 291E-61(a)(3). Consequently, we reverse Sato's conviction for
 violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment 
entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, 
'Ewa 
Division, on March 11, 2014, is reversed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, December 23, 2015.
