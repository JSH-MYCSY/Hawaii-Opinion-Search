IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MARTIN PETER ALFRED WESLY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
EWA DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTI-13-170129)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Martin Peter Alfred Wesly (Wesly)
 
appeals pro se from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order
 
and Plea/Judgment (Judgment) entered against him and in favor of
 
the State, on April 7, 2014, by the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit, 'Ewa Division (District Court),  on the traffic
infraction of Noncompliance with Speed Limit in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) ยง 291C-102(a)(1) (2007). 
On appeal, Wesly contends that the District Court erred

 
when it denied his motion to dismiss this case on the grounds
 that his last name was incorrectly spelled "Wesley" rather than
 "Wesly" on the speeding ticket. In addition, Wesly argues, inter
 alia, that there was insufficient evidence to support the
 District Court's Judgment against him.

 The Honorable Alvin K. Nishimura presided. Although no transcript
was provided by the appellant, it appears that a different judge presided over
Wesly's oral motion to dismiss.

The State contends that Wesly's conviction must be
 
affirmed because Wesly failed to order transcripts and thus
 
failed to furnish this court with a sufficient record to
 positively demonstrate the alleged errors. We agree. 
Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 10 
imposes an obligation on the appellant to order transcripts of oral proceedings before the trial court when the "appellant desires to raise any point on appeal that requires consideration of [such] oral proceedings[.]" HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(A); see Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995) ("[t]he burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript") (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Here, no transcripts were requested for Wesly's appeal. Thus, Wesly has failed to meet his burden of providing an adequate record to show error in the denial of his oral motion and/or the sufficiency of the testimonial evidence presented to the District Court. HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(A); Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i at 230, 
909 P.2d at 558. 
Accordingly, the District Court's April 7, 2014
 
Judgment is affirmed.
