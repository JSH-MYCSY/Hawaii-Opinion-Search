IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
NOLAN L.K. CRABBE, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS PRISONER NO. 10-1-0090)
(CRIMINAL NO. 00-1-0300)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Nolan L.K. Crabbe (Crabbe) appeals 
from an April 10, 2014 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment Pursuant to Rule 40 [Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)]," 
entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 (circuit
 
court).
 
On appeal, Crabbe contends the circuit court erred in
 
denying his ineffectiveness of counsel claim and his other
 asserted grounds for relief - newly discovered evidence, use of
 evidence pursuant to an unlawful arrest, prosecutorial
 misconduct, and illegal sentence.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Crabbe's
 appeal is without merit.

On November 17, 2010, Crabbe filed a "Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment" (Petition) pursuant to
 
HRPP Rule 40. On September 16, 2011, the circuit court denied
 
the Petition a hearing and then dismissed the Petition, finding
 "Crabbe's claims to be patently frivolous and without trace of
 support either in the record or from other evidence
 submitted . . . ." Crabbe appealed and on September 27, 2013,
 this court in a memorandum opinion entered in case no. CAAP-11Â­0001059, vacated the circuit court's order denying the Petition
 and remanded the case for a hearing.
 
On March 5, 2014, the circuit court held an evidentiary
 
hearing on Crabbe's Petition. Testifying at the hearing were
 both Crabbe and his former counsel, who disputed Crabbe's claims
 and testimony.
 
Crabbe's ineffectiveness of counsel claims are based on
 
his allegations that his attorney at the time of the change of
 plea and sentencing continually lied to and misled him regarding
 both the substance and the procedural requirements of his plea
 deal such that he was in effect fraudulently induced into
 accepting both the deal and the subsequent sentence.
 
The circuit court found the testimony of Crabbe's 
former counsel to be credible and found Crabbe's testimony not credible, and on April 10, 2014 issued the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment Pursuant to Rule 40 HRPP" denying Crabbe's Petition once again. This court "will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." State v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai
'i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999) 
(citation, internal quotation mark and brackets omitted). There was substantial evidence to support the circuit court's findings, and thus the circuit court's findings were not clearly erroneous and its conclusions were not in error. 
Crabbe's other points on appeal were waived by his no 
contest pleas, State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 785 P.2d 1316 (1990), and his failure to argue them in this appeal. See Hawai
'i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure 28(b)(7).
