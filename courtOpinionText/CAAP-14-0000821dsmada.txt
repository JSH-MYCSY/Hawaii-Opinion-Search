making the opening brief due on July 28, 2014, pursuant to HRAP
 
Rule 28(b). 
(3) Appellant did not file a request for transcripts
 
or statement of points of error on appeal, and on June 5, 2014,
 Appellee filed a motion for an order requiring Appellant to
 comply with HRAP Rule 10(b)(1) and (4) and for sanctions. 
(4) On June 19, 2014, this court granted the June 5,
 
2014 motion in part, denying the motion for sanctions and
 ordering Appellant, through Counsel, to file, within five (5)
 days of the date of the order, a request for all transcripts or a
 statement of points of error on appeal, consistent with HRAP Rule
 10(b)(4), and that failure to timely comply may result in
 sanctions including dismissal of the appeal.
 
(5) Thereafter, Appellant did not file a request for
 
transcripts or statement of points of error on appeal.
 
(6) On June 27, 2014, Appellee filed a motion to
 
dismiss the appeal and for sanctions.
 
(7) On July 21, 2014, this court issued an order (a)
 
denying the June 27, 2014 motion; (b) ordering Appellant, through
 Counsel, to file within five (5) days of the order a request for
 all transcripts or a statement of points of error on appeal, and
 that failure to comply may result in sanctions; and (c) ordering
 Counsel within ten (10) days of the order to show cause as to why
 he failed to timely file a request for all transcripts or a
 statement of points of error on appeal, pursuant to this court's
 June 19, 2014 order, and that failure to timely respond to the
 
-2­order or show good cause may result in sanctions.
 
(8) Thereafter, Appellant failed to file a request for
 
transcripts or a statement of points of error on appeal and
 
Counsel failed to timely respond to the order to show cause.

request for extension of time to file the opening brief by the

(10) On July 29, 2014, Appellee filed the instant
 
Motion, requesting an order dismissing the appeal and sanctioning
 Appellant for failing to file an opening brief by the deadline or
 comply with the July 21, 2014 order to file a request of all
 transcripts or statement of points of error on appeal.
 
(11) On August 26, 2014, Counsel filed a Statement of
 
Payment of Sanctions, which showed that he had submitted an
 untimely payment of the monetary sanctions this court had
 previously ordered him to pay in this appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to dismiss the 
appeal is granted and this appeal is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for sanctions is 
denied.
