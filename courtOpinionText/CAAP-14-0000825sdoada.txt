and ten years for Count Three. In appellate court case no. 
20392, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court affirmed the conviction against 
Kehano. On March 8, 2004, the circuit court denied Kehano's first Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition 
for post-conviction relief in S.P.P. no. 03-1-0017. 
On December 27, 2013, Kehano filed another HRPP Rule 40 
petition for post-conviction relief in case no. S.P.P. 13-1-0014. (Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition) On March 25, 2014, Respondent-
Appellee State of Hawai
'i filed a memorandum in response to 
Kehano's Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition. 
On April 3, 2014, the circuit court denied the Second
 
HRPP Rule 40 Petition. On April 3, 2014, the circuit court clerk
 
served on Kehano, by way of mail, a copy of the order denying
 Kehano's Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition. On May 1, 2014, Kehano's
 filed a post-judgment motion for reconsideration of the order
 denying his Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition.
 
On May 5, 2014, the circuit court entered a post-
judgment order denying the motion for reconsideration of the
 Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition. On May 9, 2014, Kehano submitted a
 signed document, deemed as a notice of appeal, that does not
 designate any specific judgment or order. The appellate court
 filed this document on May 14, 2014 creating this appeal.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Kehano's
 appeal is without merit.
 
Kehano's Second HRPP Rule 40 Petition is patently
 
frivolous, the issues have been previously raised and ruled upon
 or waived. HRPP Rule 40(g)(2).
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
Second Circuit's April 3, 2014 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Law, And Judgment Denying Rule 40 Petition For Post-Conviction
 
Relief"; and May 5, 2014 "Order Denying Motion For
 Reconsideration" are affirmed.
