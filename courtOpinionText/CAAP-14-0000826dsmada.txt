(the Graycohceas) (collectively Appellants);  and the record and

files herein,  the Motion to Dismiss is granted.   
On May 14, 2014, Appellants filed a notice of appeal,
 
through which they appeal from Judgments for Possession in favor
 
of Appellee, which were accompanied by Writs of Possession, and
 also challenge the following, all filed in the District Court of
 the First Circuit (district court):
 
A.	 Decision and Order as to Summary Possession for
Stella Mulivai, filed by Judge Gerald Kibe on
April 25, 2014;
 
B.	 Orders Denying Defendant's Motion to Disqualify
Judge Gerald Kibe for Mulivai (1RC12-1-7984)
filed by Judge Michael Tanigawa on March 19,
2013; for the Taipins (1RC12-1-7985) filed by
Judge Michael Tanigawa on March 21, 2013; and
for the Graycocheas (1RC12-1-7986) filed by

 Appellants' Opposition states that the Taipins have agreed with
Appellee "to not appeal or challenge" Appellee, and that the Opposition
excludes the Taipins based on representations that such an agreement exists.

 We note that Appellee filed a reply to Appellants' Opposition on
August 6, 2014. However, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 27 does
not authorize a reply, and Appellee did not seek permission of this court tofile a reply. We therefore will not consider Appellee's reply in deciding theMotion to Dismiss.

I. Denial of March 12, 2014 Oral Motion to Dismiss.
 
Although the Judgments for Possession did not resolve
 
all the claims in the underlying cases, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
has recognized an exception to the finality requirement under the
 
Forgay doctrine. See Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848);
 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). 
Under the  Forgay doctrine, "[w]e have jurisdiction to consider
 
appeals from judgments which 'require immediate execution of a
 
command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary,
 and the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if
 appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the
 litigation.'" Ciesla, 78 Hawai
'i at 20, 889 P.2d at 704 
(citation and brackets omitted). For this appeal, however, we
 conclude that the appeal must be dismissed because it is moot. 
In 
Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem , 119 Haw. 1, 5,
 
193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated: 
It is well-settled that:
 
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the
circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a
suit previously suitable for determination. Put
 another way, the suit must remain alive throughout the
course of litigation to the moment of final appellate
disposition. Its chief purpose is to assure that the
adversary system, once set in operation, remains
properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate where
events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties
that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on
appeal -- adverse interest and effective remedy -­have been compromised.
 
Lathrop [v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, 312–13, 141 P.3d 480,
485–86 (2008)] (citations omitted) (format altered); see 
also In re Doe Children, 105 Hawai' i 38, 57, 93 P.3d 1145,
1164 (2004) (stating that "the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal [are] adverse interest andeffective remedy"). 
"A case is moot if it has lost its character as a
 
present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts
 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law." 
Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Grp. v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 87, 734 P.2d 161, 165 (1987) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). Further, "a case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant effective relief." Kaho
'ohanohano v. State, 114 
Hawai'i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007) (internal quotation 
marks, brackets, emphasis, citation, and block quotation format omitted). 
In this case, it is undisputed that Appellants have all
 
vacated their respective properties. Appellants signed documents
 in which they agreed to vacate their respective properties in
 exchange for Appellee's agreement to, among other things, forgo
 seeking attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the summary
 possession proceedings. Appellants have vacated their respective
 properties and it appears that the writs of possession were not
 executed. "The termination of possession without execution of a
 
writ of possession moots all questions about the validity of the
 
order authorizing the issuance of the writ of possession and of
 the writ itself." Crown Properties, Inc. v. Financial Sec. Life
 
Ins. Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985). 
Furthermore, Appellants' leases have terminated, and
 
Appellants have not demonstrated an entitlement to regain
 possession based on their leases, even if this court were to
 vacate the Judgments for Possession. Accordingly, this appeal
 from the Judgments for Possession is moot. See Exit Co Ltd.
 
P'ship v. Airlines Capital Corp., Inc., 7 Haw. App. 363, 366, 766
 P.2d 129, 131 (1988) (determining in a summary possession case
 
-4­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that an appeal from a judgment for possession is moot where the 
appellant legally cannot regain possession of the subject premises, i.e., the Lease is "not subject to renewal or extension," should the judgment for possession be vacated by the appellate court).
3 
Appellants purport to appeal from numerous other orders
 
which were not directly related to, and did not form the basis
 for, the Judgments for Possession on which this Forgay appeal is
 based. These other orders (identified in Paragraphs B through I
 above) are interlocutory and are not subject to review in this
 appeal.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss is
 
granted. The appeal in No. CAAP-14-0000826 is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
 
dismissed as moot.

'i, August 13, 2014.

 To the extent that the Taipins have entered into an
agreement with Appellee to dismiss their appeal, such agreement
provides an additional ground as to the Taipins for dismissing
the appeal.
