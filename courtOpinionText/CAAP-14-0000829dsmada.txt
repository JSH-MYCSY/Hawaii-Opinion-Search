APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC13-1-7185)

 
ORDER GRANTING THE JUNE 10, 2014 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon consideration of the June 10, 2014 "Plaintiff-

 On June 26, 2014, Trotter filed a "Motion for Extension of Time to
Respond to [the Motion to Dismiss]" (Motion for Extension). Noting that the
Motion for Extension was untimely and failed to provide good cause to excuse
the untimeliness or explain why the motion could not have been filed earlier,
this court nevertheless granted it in part, giving Trotter until July 7, 2014
to file a response limited to certain issues. On July 10, 2014, Trotter
untimely moved for a second extension to file a response to the Motion to
Dismiss, which we granted in part, extending the deadline to July 22, 2014.

Defendant-Appellant Robert Trotter (Trotter), and the files and

record herein,  the Motion to Dismiss is granted.
On May 15, 2014, Trotter filed a Notice of Appeal,

 
through which he appeals from the April 23, 2014 Judgment for
 
Possession and Writ of Possession, and also challenges the
 following, all filed in the District Court of the First Circuit
 (district court):
 
A.	 April 16, 2014 Memorandum of Decision and
Order.
 
B.	 February 24, 2014 order denying Trotter's
motion for continuance to file closing
arguments. 
C.	 March 4, 2014 order denying Trotter's motion
to disqualify District Court Judge Melanie G.
May. 
D.	 December 4, 2013 oral denial of Trotter's
motion to dismiss the complaint based on the
failure of one of Continental Pacific's
 witnesses to appear.
 
Although the Judgment for Possession did not resolve 
all the claims in the underlying case, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
has recognized an exception to the finality requirement under the 
Forgay doctrine. See Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848); 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). 
Under the Forgay doctrine, "[w]e have jurisdiction to consider 
appeals from judgments which 'require immediate execution of a 
command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary,

On July 22, 2014, Trotter filed the Opposition.

 We note that Continental Pacific filed a reply to Trotter's
Opposition on August 6, 2014. However, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure
Rule 27 does not authorize a reply, and Continental Pacific did not seek
permission of this court to file a reply. We therefore will not consider Continental Pacific's reply in deciding the Motion to Dismiss.

appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the
 litigation.'" Ciesla, 78 Hawai
'i at 20, 889 P.2d at 704 
(citation and brackets omitted). For this appeal, however, we
 conclude that the appeal must be dismissed because it is moot.

In Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem
, 119 Haw. 1, 5,
 
193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated: 
It is well-settled that:
 
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the
circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a
suit previously suitable for determination. Put
 another way, the suit must remain alive throughout the
course of litigation to the moment of final appellate
disposition. Its chief purpose is to assure that the
adversary system, once set in operation, remains
properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate where
events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties
that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on
appeal — adverse interest and effective remedy — have
been compromised.
 
Lathrop[ v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, at 312–13, 141 P.3d
480, at 485–86 (2008)] (citations omitted) (format altered);
see also In re Doe Children, 105 Hawai' i 38, 57, 93 P.3d
1145, 1164 (2004) (stating that "the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal [are] adverse interest andeffective remedy"). 
"A case is moot if it has lost its character as a
 
present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts
 
are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law." 
Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Grp. v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 87, 734 P.2d
 161, 165 (1987) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation

 longer grant effective relief." Kaho
'ohanohano v. State, 114 
Hawai'i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007) (internal quotation

 omitted).

In this case, Trotter entered into an agreement with
 
Continental Pacific (Agreement to Vacate), in which he agreed to
 
vacate the subject property (Property) in exchange for
 Continental Pacific's agreement to forgo seeking attorney's fees
 
and costs for the summary possession proceeding. As a condition
 of the Agreement to Vacate, Trotter surrendered possession of the
 Property to Continental Pacific, which has possessed it since
 that time. Trotter argues in his Opposition that the Agreement
 to Vacate was subsequently invalidated by Continental Pacific's
 breach of a separate agreement giving Trotter thirty days from
 May 15, 2014 to remove a structure on the Property. 
Regardless of the Agreement to Vacate's validity, there
 
is no dispute that Trotter vacated the Property and, accordingly, 
the writ of possession was not executed. "The termination of
 possession without execution of a writ of possession moots all
 questions about the validity of the order authorizing the
 issuance of the writ of possession and the writ itself." Crown
 
Properties, Inc. v. Financial Security Life Insurance Co., Ltd.,
 6 Haw. App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985).
 
Further, the appeal is moot because the lease
 
terminated, and Trotter has not demonstrated an entitlement to
 regain possession based on the lease, even if this court were to
 vacate the Judgment for Possession. See Exit Co Ltd. P'ship v.
 
Airlines Capital Corp., Inc., 7 Haw. App. 363, 366, 766 P.2d 129,
 131 (1988) (determining in a summary possession case that an
 appeal from a judgment for possession is moot where the appellant
 legally cannot regain possession of the subject premises, i.e.,
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the Lease is "not subject to renewal or extension," should the 
judgment for possession be vacated by the appellate court). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Motion to Dismiss is 
granted. The appeal in No. CAAP-14-0000829 is dismissed.
