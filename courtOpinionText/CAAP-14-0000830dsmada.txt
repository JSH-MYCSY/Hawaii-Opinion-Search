v.
 
JOHN WESLEY ERRETT and KAY ANNE KROEHLER, Defendants-Appellants

(CASE NO. 1RC13-1-6195)

 
ORDER GRANTING THE JULY 3, 2014 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon consideration of "Plaintiff-Appellee Continental
 
Pacific, LLC's [(Appellee)] Motion to Dismiss Appeal" (Motion to
 
Dismiss) and the papers in support, filed on July 3, 2014, the
 "Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss" (Opposition) by
 John Wesley Errett and Kaye Anne Kroehler (collectively,
 Appellants), filed on July 24, 2014, the attachment thereto, and

the record and files herein,  the Motion to Dismiss is granted.

 We note that Appellee filed a reply to Appellants' Opposition on
July 31, 2014. However, Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 27
does not authorize a reply and Appellee did not seek permission of this court
to file a reply. We, therefore, will not consider Appellee's reply indeciding the Motion to Dismiss.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 15, 2014, Appellants filed a notice of appeal,
 
through which they appeal from the April 23, 2014 Judgment for
 
Possession, which was accompanied by the April 23, 2014 Writ of
 Possession, and also challenge the following, all filed in the
 District Court of the First Circuit (District Court): 
A.	 Memorandum of Decision and Order as to Summary
Possession, filed by Judge Melanie May on April
16, 2014;
 
B.	 Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Enforce
Subpoena of 11/14/2013 and stay destruction of
video tapes; 
C.	 Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on
March 28, 2014;
 
D.	 Denial of Defendants' Motion to Disqualify Judge
Melanie May on March 4, 2014;
 
E.	 Denial of Motion for Reconsideration to Admit
 Rebuttal Evidence on March 10, 2014;
 
F.	 Denial of Defendants' oral request for Judge May
to order Judge Richardson to turn over all
communication that she received from Judges
sitting on related case;
 
G.	 Denial of Defendants' Motion to Allow Testimony
of Fingerprint Expert;
 
H.	 Rulings on February 25 and 25, 2014 that limited
the time to present Defendants' case.
 
Although the Judgments for Possession did not resolve 
all the claims in the underlying cases, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
has recognized an exception to the finality requirement under the 
Forgay doctrine. See Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848); 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). 
Under the Forgay doctrine, "[w]e have jurisdiction to consider 
appeals from judgments which 'require immediate execution of a 
command that property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the litigation.'" Ciesla, 78 Hawai
'i at 20, 889 P.2d at 704 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(citation and brackets omitted). For this appeal, however, we 
conclude that the appeal must be dismissed because it is moot. 
In Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Haw. 1, 5, 
193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated: 
It is well-settled that: 
The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the
circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a
suit previously suitable for determination. Put
another way, the suit must remain alive throughout the
course of litigation to the moment of final appellate
disposition. Its chief purpose is to assure that the
adversary system, once set in operation, remains
properly fueled. The doctrine seems appropriate where
events subsequent to the judgment of the trial court
have so affected the relations between the parties
that the two conditions for justiciability relevant on
appeal -- adverse interest and effective remedy -­have been compromised.
 
Lathrop [v. Sakatani], 111 Hawai' i [307,] 312-13, 141 P.3d [480,]
485-86 (citations omitted) (format altered); see also In re Doe 
Children, 105 Hawai' i 38, 57, 93 P.3d 1145, 1164 (2004) (stating
that "the two conditions for justiciability relevant on appeal
[are] adverse interest and effective remedy"). 
Hamilton v. Lethem, 119 Hawai 'i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). 
"A case is moot if it has lost its character as a 
present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts 
are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law." Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Grp. v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 87, 734 P.2d 161, 165 (1987) (internal quotation mark, brackets, and citation omitted). Further, "a case is moot if the reviewing court can no longer grant effective relief." Kaho
'ohanohano v. State, 114 
Hawai'i 302, 332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007) (internal quotation marks, brackets, emphasis, citation, and block quotation format omitted). 
In this case, it is undisputed that Appellants have
 
vacated their property. Appellants signed an agreement dated
 April 24, 2014, in which they agreed to vacate the property by
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
May 15, 2014 in exchange for Appellee waving its claims "for 
damages, attorneys' fees, and/or costs incurred in the summary possession case against [Appellants]." We note that Appellants argue that the agreement was subsequently invalidated for various reasons. 
However, regardless of the validity of the agreement to
 
vacate, Appellants have vacated their property and it appears
 that the writ of possession was not executed. "The termination
 of possession without execution of a writ of possession moots all
 questions about the validity of the order authorizing the
 issuance of the writ of possession and the writ itself." Crown
 
Properties, Inc. v. Financial Sec. Life Ins. Co., Ltd., 6 Haw.
 App. 105, 112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985).
 
Furthermore, Appellants' lease has terminated, and
 
Appellants have not demonstrated an entitlement to regain
 possession based on their lease, even if this court were to
 vacate the Judgments for Possession. Accordingly, this appeal is
 moot. See Exit Co Ltd. P'ship v. Airlines Capital Corp., Inc., 7
 
Haw. App. 363, 366, 766 P.2d 129, 131 (1988) (determining in a
 summary possession case that an appeal from a judgment for
 possession is moot where the appellant legally cannot regain
 possession of the subject premises, i.e., the Lease is "not
 subject to renewal or extension," should the judgment for
 possession be vacated by the appellate court).
 
To the extent that Appellants purport to appeal from
 
orders that involve matters that are independent of, and not
 resolved by, the Judgment for Possession on which this Forgay
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal is based, such orders are interlocutory and are not 
subject to review in this appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss is
 
granted. The appeal in CAAP-14-0000830 is dismissed.
