 Kim's Opening Brief is in violation of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 in many respects, most notably that its "Statement of
Points Relied Upon" does not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) insofar as it doesnot provide record citations for the challenged actions of the Circuit Courtnor for the preservation of these errors for appeal. "[S]uch noncomplianceoffers sufficient grounds for the dismissal of the appeal."

(1) when it conducted the end-of-trial Tachibana colloquy because
 
it "did not fully advise [Kim] of his rights and because it was
 not a true exchange[;]" and (2) when it allegedly "intimidated"
 Kim throughout the trial and thus allegedly influenced Kim's
 decision not to testify at his trial.
 
After a careful review of the points raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, the applicable legal authority and
 the record, we resolve Kim's points as follows and affirm.
 
1. Kim argues that the Circuit Court's end-of-trial
 
Tachibana colloquy was inadequate because it "did not fully
 advise [Kim] of his rights and because it was not a true
 exchange."
 
The Circuit Court fully advised Kim of the five rights

required by the Tachibana colloquy.
 
The Tachibana colloquy conducted by the Circuit Court 
adequately fulfilled the reasons for the colloquy. The two purposes of the Tachibana colloquy are "(1) the protection of a defendant's personal right to testify; and (2) the minimization of post-conviction disputes over the actual waiver of the right to testify." State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i 292, 295, 12 P.3d 1233, 
1236 (2000). The Circuit Court read Kim's rights to him then

Nevertheless, we recognize that our appellate courts have
"consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to
have their cases heard on the merits, where possible," Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 
420, 32 P.3d at 64 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasissupplied), and in several instances have addressed the merits of an appeal,noncompliance with the appellate rules notwithstanding. See, e.g., Housing 
Fin. & Dev. Corp., 91 Hawai' i at 85-86, 979 P.2d at 1111-12; O'Connor v.
Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994).
Therefore, we will endeavor to do so here, to the extent possible.

 [(1)] that he or she has a right to testify, [(2)]
that if he or she wants to testify that no one can
prevent him or her from doing so, and [(3)] that if he
or she testifies the prosecution will be allowed to
cross-examine him or her. In connection with the
 privilege against self-incrimination, the defendant
should also be advised [(4)] that he or she has a
right not to testify and [(5)] that if he or she does
not testify then the jury can be instructed about that
right.

engaged in a colloquy in which Kim acknowledged he understood
 
those rights and ultimately that he had chosen not to testify.
 
After engaging in a discussion with Kim, the Circuit 
Court clearly articulated its assessment that, "he look[ed] very cognizant and alert" and understood the Tachibana colloquy and its implications. "To determine whether a waiver of a fundamental right was voluntarily and intelligently undertaken, this court will look to the totality of the facts and circumstances of each particular case." State v. Christian, 88 
Hawai
'i 407, 420, 967 P.2d 239, 252 (1998) (quoting State v. 
Merino, 81 Hawai 'i 198, 221, 915 P.2d 672, 695 (1996)) (internal 
quotation marks omitted, formatting altered). Taking the record as a whole, we conclude that the Circuit Court adequately advised Kim of his rights and obtained a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to testify. 
2. Kim argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
allegedly "intimidated" Kim throughout the trial and thus
 allegedly influenced Kim's decision not to testify at his trial. 
Kim argues that "[t]he trial court even went so far as
 threatening to admonish [Kim] in front of the jury and to eject
 him from the courtroom and to have the trial without [Kim.]"
 
Over the course of Kim's two-day trial, the Circuit
 
Court twice admonished Kim not to make faces, gestures, or
 otherwise attempt to communicate to the jury from his seat during
 proceedings. The Circuit Court first admonished him after jury
 selection voir dire and next admonished him during defense
 counsel's cross-examination of witness Lewis. Kim did not deny
 that he engaged in this conduct. Neither warning was in front of
 the jury and at neither point did defense counsel object to the
 Circuit Court admonishing Kim.
 
A trial court is well within its discretion to warn a
 
Defendant that he could lose his right to be present at trial, if
 after he has been warned by the judge that he will be removed if
 he continues his disruptive behavior and then persists in the
 conduct. See Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 343 (1970). 
Without more, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court's
 warnings in an effort to maintain order were sufficiently

intimidating as to affect Kim's decision to waive his right to
 
testify.
 
Therefore, the April 30, 2014 Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
