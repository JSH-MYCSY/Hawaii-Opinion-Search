IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff/Appellee,
v.
 
ROBERT H. ALLEN, Defendant/Appellee,
and
 
EXODUS BAIL BOND, Real-Party-In-Interest/Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-0963)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Real-Party-in-Interest/Appellant Exodus Bail Bond
 
(Exodus) appeals from an "Order Denying Motion to Set-Aside Bail
 
Forfeiture," entered on April 17, 2014, in the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit (circuit court).
1 Exodus posted bail on behalf
 
of Defendant Robert Allen (Allen), who failed to appear for trial
 call on January 23, 2014. On January 29, 2014, the circuit court
 entered a "Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond" (Bail
 Forfeiture Judgment) due to Allen's failure to appear. Exodus
 received notice of the Bail Forfeiture Judgment on February 7,
 2014, and then on March 5, 2014 filed a "Motion to Set-Aside Bail
 Forfeiture" (Motion to Set-Aside) pursuant to Hawaii Revised

 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Statutes (HRS) § 804-51 (2014).2 After the circuit court denied
 
the Motion to Set-Aside, Exodus filed a "Motion to Reconsider
 
Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture" (Motion to Reconsider) on
 April 24, 2014 because Allen had been surrendered to authorities.
 
On appeal, Exodus asserts that (1) the Bail Forfeiture
 
Judgment is void because (a) the Department of Prosecuting
 Attorney (Prosecuting Attorney) is not permitted to represent
 Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) in a bail forfeiture 
proceeding, and (b) the Prosecuting Attorney is not permitted to
 enforce the Bail Forfeiture Judgment; and (2) the circuit court
 erred in denying its Motion to Reconsider. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Exodus's
 points of error as follows and affirm.
 
2 HRS § 804-51 provides in pertinent part
 
§804-51 Procedure.  Whenever the court, in any
criminal cause, forfeits any bond or recognizance given in a
criminal cause, the court shall immediately enter up
judgment in favor of the State and against the principal or
principals and surety or sureties on the bond, jointly and
severally, for the full amount of the penalty thereof, and
shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately after the
expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is given
via personal service or certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the surety or sureties on the bond, of the
entry of the judgment in favor of the State, unless before
the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given to the surety or sureties on the bond of the entry of
the judgment in favor of the State, a motion or application
of the principal or principals, surety or sureties, or any
of them, showing good cause why execution should not issue
upon the judgment, is filed with the court. If the motion
 or application, after a hearing held thereon, is sustained,
the court shall vacate the judgment of forfeiture and, if
the principal surrenders or is surrendered pursuant to
section 804-14 or section 804-41, return the bond or
recognizance to the principal or surety, whoever shall have
given it, less the amount of any cost, as established at the
hearing, incurred by the State as a result of the
nonappearance of the principal or other event on the basis
of which the court forfeited the bond or recognizance. If
 the motion or application, after a hearing held thereon, is
overruled, execution shall forthwith issue and shall not be
stayed unless the order overruling the motion or application
is appealed from as in the case of a final judgment.

(1) In violation of Rule 28 of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP), Exodus fails to provide citations in 
its opening brief to indicate where in the record it raised its arguments before the circuit court. Further, review of Exodus's Motion to Set-Aside and Motion to Reconsider filed in the circuit court reveals that Exodus did not make any argument challenging the Prosecuting Attorney's authority to represent the State regarding bail forfeiture. Exodus also fails to provide transcripts of hearings and thus fails to demonstrate that it raised this argument orally before the circuit court. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995). Therefore, Exodus has waived its argument challenging the authority of the Prosecuting Attorney to represent the State in bail forfeiture proceedings. State v. 
Moses, 102 Hawai
'i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003); HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4). 
Even if Exodus had properly preserved the issue for
 
review, this court has considered and rejected Exodus's
 contention that the Prosecuting Attorney is not authorized to
 represent the State in bail forfeiture proceedings. See State v.
 
Miles, No. CAAP-13-0000193 (App. June 23, 2015). Further, like
 in Miles, this case does not involve the enforcement of a bail
 forfeiture judgment, but rather the issuance of the forfeiture
 judgment and Exodus's efforts to have that judgment set aside
 under the provisions of HRS § 804-51.
 
(2) Exodus contends that the circuit court erred by
 
failing to grant its Motion to Reconsider because Allen was
 captured two days after the April 1, 2014 hearing on the Motion
 to Set-Aside, which Exodus argues was newly discovered evidence
 showing good cause. 
A surety may obtain relief from a forfeiture judgment
 
upon "showing good cause why execution should not issue upon the
 judgment[.]" HRS § 804-51. A surety demonstrates good cause
 when "it appears that they are unable, through no fault of their
 own or of the principal, to perform the conditions of the

bond[.]" State v. Camara, 81 Hawai 'i 324, 330, 916 P.2d 1225, 
1231 (1996) (citation omitted). "[A]bsent good cause a surety's 
failure to surrender the defendant within the thirty-day search period provided by HRS § 804-51 mandates forfeiture of the bond." State v. Vaimili, 131 Hawai
'i 9, 17, 313 P.3d 698, 706 (2013). 
As noted in State v. Ranger Ins. Co. ex rel James 
Lindblad, Inc., 83 Hawai 'i 118, 925 P.2d 288 (1996), "HRS § 804­
51 permits the filing neither of a second motion seeking to show 'good cause why execution should not issue' nor any motion after the closing of the thirty-day window." Id. at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d 
at 294 n.5. Exodus received notice of the Bail Forfeiture Judgment on February 7, 2014. Thus, Exodus's April 24, 2014 Motion to Reconsider was filed well outside the thirty-day window. Exodus's April 24, 2014 Motion to Reconsider was thus an unpermitted and untimely second effort to set aside the Bail Forfeiture Judgment. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying
 
Motion to Set-Aside Bail Forfeiture," entered April 17, 2014, and
 the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 Exodus Bail Bonds' Motion to Reconsider Motion to Set Aside Bail
 Forfeiture," entered May 6, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit are affirmed.
