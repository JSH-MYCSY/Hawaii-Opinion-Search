KENNETH M. SKAHAN,
Claimant/Appellee/Appellant,
v.
 
STUTTS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, INC.,
Employer/Appellant/Appellee,
and
 
FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY OF HAWAII, LTD.,
Insurance Carrier/Appellant/Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2014-019(WH)) (9-04-45072(M))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
 
LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN
 
APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-14-0000850
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Claimant/Appellee/Appellant
 
Kenneth M. Skahan (Appellant Skahan) has asserted from the Labor
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (the LIRAB)1
 May 11,
2014, "Order Granting Employees' Motion for Stay of Payments" and
 
the LIRAB's May 14, 2014 "Order Denying Motion for Stay of
 Suspension of Medical Benefits" (collectively, "Stay Orders"),
 because the Stay Orders are not independently appealable orders.
 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-88
 
(Supp. 2013) and HRS § 91-14(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013), an aggrieved
 party may appeal a final decision and order by the LIRAB directly
 to the intermediate court of appeals:
 
The appeal of a decision or order of the LIRAB is
governed by HRS § 91-14(a), the statute authorizing appeals
in administrative agency cases. HRS § 91-14(a) authorizes
judicial review of a final decision and order in a contested
case or a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of
review pending entry of a subsequent final decision would
deprive appellant of adequate relief. For purposes of HRS §
91-14(a), we have defined "final order" to mean an order
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. . . . Consequently, an order is not final if
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
matter is retained for further action.
 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, 89 
Hawai'i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (citation and some 
internal quotation marks omitted). The Stay Orders did not end the proceedings before the LIRAB and leave nothing further to be accomplished. According to the record on appeal, the LIRAB has yet to enter a final order that finally adjudicates the substantive issues in Employer/Appellant/Appellee Stutts Construction Co., Inc., and Insurance Carrier/Appellant/Appellee First Insurance Company of Hawaii, Ltd.'s administrative appeal in case number AB 2014-019 (WH), which is still pending before the LIRAB. Therefore, the Stay Orders are not appealable final

orders under HRS § 386-88 and HRS § 91-14(a). Although 
exceptions to the final order requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the Stay Orders do not satisfy all the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). Absent an appealable final decision and order by the LIRAB, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000850 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellant court case number CAAP-14-0000850 are dismissed as
 moot.
