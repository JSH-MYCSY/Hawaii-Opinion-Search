APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0197(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Chad T. Metcalfe (Metcalfe) appeals
 
from a May 23, 2014 Judgment (Judgment), which finalized the
 
Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, for
 
Distribution of Proceeds, for Writ of Possession, and for
 Deficiency Judgment, entered on May 13, 2014 (Confirmation
 
Order), by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit
 
Court).

In this appeal, Metcalfe raises a single point of
 
error. Metcalfe contends that the Circuit Court erred in
 
awarding attorneys' fees to Plaintiff-Appellee Central Pacific
 Bank (CPB) because CPB's motion for, inter alia, an award of
 
attorneys' fees was filed more than 14 days after the entry of an

appealable order or judgment, i.e. the Circuit Court's Findings
 
of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 for Summary Judgment on All Claims and Against Defendants (1)
 Chad T. Metcalfe, and (2) Child Support Enforcement Agency, State
 of Hawaii; Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale
 filed herein on October 23, 2013, which was entered on January 9,
 2014 (Foreclosure Decree),
2
 and after Metcalfe's filing of a
notice of appeal from the Foreclosure Decree.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 conclude that Metcalfe's appeal is without merit.
 
In essence, Metcalfe argues that, because the 
Foreclosure Decree was an appealable order or judgment, CPB's failure to file a motion for attorneys' fees within the time frame set forth in Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 
54(d)(2)(B) and prior to the filing of the notice of appeal from the Foreclosure Decree deprived the Circuit Court of jurisdiction. "Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case." TSA Int'l, Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 
713, 735 (1999) (citations omitted). However, "[n]otwithstanding the general effect of the filing of a notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, and may act in aid of the appeal." Id. For example, "an appeal under Rule 54(b) does not divest the 
trial court of jurisdiction to proceed with the other issues in the case." Sturkie v. Han, 2 Haw. App. 140, 146, 627 P.2d 296, 
301 (1981); Territory v. Damon, 44 Haw. 557, 356 P.2d 386 (1960). In his appeal of the Foreclosure Decree, Metcalfe did not post a supersedeas bond that was required to stay enforcement of the Foreclosure Decree. In a foreclosure case,

 Metcalfe also argues that CPB failed to file the motion which
included the attorney's fees request within 14 days of the February 25, 2014
order denying reconsideration of the Foreclosure Decree.

[t]he decree of foreclosure is deemed final for appeal
purposes notwithstanding the fact that many matters relating
to it remain undetermined. Matters such as the order of
 
sale, appointment of commissioner, confirmation of sale,
award of costs and fees, and award of deficiency judgment
are deemed to be incidents to the enforcement of the decree
 of foreclosure, . . . and errors unique to them are
separately appealable, . . . when they are fully
adjudicated[.]
 
Sturkie, 2 Haw. App. at 146-47, 627 P.2d at 302 (footnote and

Accordingly, the Circuit Court's May 23, 2014 Judgment
 
is affirmed.
