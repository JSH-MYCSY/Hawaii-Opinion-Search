NO. CAAP-14-0000856 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
NICHOLAS R. PAO, JR., Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
RICHARD C. DEWAELE, Attorney-at-Law, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 04-1-1339)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Nicholas R. Pao, Jr. (Pao), appeals
 
from an April 29, 2014 Final Judgment entered in the Circuit
 
1
Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court) in favor of
 
Defendant-Appellee Richard C. Dewaele (
Dewaele).
 
On July 22, 2004, Pao filed a Verified Complaint for

 
legal malpractice against Dewaele. After the entry and setting
 
aside of a default, Dewaele filed his answer on August 15, 2005.
 This was the last litigation activity of significance in the
 case.
 
Eight and a half years later, the circuit court filed a
 
February 18, 2014 "Order of Dismissal Without Prejudice for
 Failure to Prosecute" because of the absence of litigation
 activity to prosecute the instant action since August 15, 2005.
 
On February 28, 2014, Pao filed a "Motion to Set Aside
 
Submission and Reopen Case" (Motion to Reopen Case). The Motion
 
to Reopen Case came on for hearing on March 21, 2014. Pao
 
1
 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeared in person at the hearing as a self-represented party and
 
Dewaele appeared by telephone.
 
Pao stated the reason for his lack of prosecution of
 
his case was in inability to secure legal representation by an
 attorney. He indicated that he had asked a number of lawyers to
 represent him. Dewaele claimed he was unduly prejudiced by the
 long delay in that he had relocated his residence to the mainland
 and his health had severely deteriorated.
 The circuit court denied Pao's Motion to Reopen Case,
 
concluding that eight and a half years is a reasonable amount of
 time to attempt to retain legal counsel and that there was an
 insufficient showing of good cause to support reopening the case. 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
denying Pao's Motion to Reopen Case pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 41(b) for failure to prosecute. Hawaii 
Automotive Retail Gasoline Dealers Assoc. v. Brodie, 2 Haw. App. 99, 626 P.2d 1173 (1981). Pao did not pursue his case in a diligent fashion and prejudice to Dewaele resulted. Id. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the April 29, 2014 Final
 
Judgment entered pursuant to the "Order Denying Motion to Set
 Aside Submission and Reopen Case Filed On 2/18/14" in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
