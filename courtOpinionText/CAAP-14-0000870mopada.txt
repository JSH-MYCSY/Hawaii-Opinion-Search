Circuit Court erred when it denied his motion for summary
judgment against Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff-Appellee/Cross-
Appellant Kulana Partners, LLC ( KPL).3 2
KPL cross-appeals.  It contends that the Circuit Court
erred when it (1) denied KPL's motion for summary judgment on
election of remedies, (2) found that Plaintiffs-Appellees/Cross-
Appellees Robert and Esther Grinpas (the Grinpases ) did not
tortiously interfere or conspire to tortiously interfere with
KPL's property rights, (3) found that Hancock, Trustee, and
Defendant/Cross-Appellee Kapaa 382, LLC ( K382) did not tortiously
interfere or conspire to tortiously interfere with KPL's property
rights, or make negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations to
KPL, and (4) denied KPL's request for attorneys' fees.
For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Second
Amended Final Judgment.
I.
This case is before us for the second time; we
summarized the factual background in Grinpas v. Kapaa 382, LLC,
No. 30139, 2012 WL 503818 (Haw. App. Feb. 15, 2012) (mem.)
(Grinpas I ).  Terms defined in Grinpas I are shown below in bold
type.
A. Pre-Lawsuit Transactions
The Grinpases own real property in Kapa#a, Kaua#i known
as Lot 77J .  In 1998 the Grinpases agreed with Hancock and K382
to purchase nearby property – a lot (Unit 2X ) in what was to
become the Kulana Condominium – and to be granted a permanent
easement through property known as Remnant 3  (also owned by
Hancock and K382) for access between Unit 2X and Lot 77J. 
Grinpas I, at *1.
The Grinpases could not purchase Unit 2X until Hancock
and K382 completed a subdivision and condominium property regime,
2The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.
3Trustee failed to file an opening brief.
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
so they entered into a fifteen year License Agreement with K382
to use the property.  A map attached to the License Agreement
shows an access way over Remnant 3 connecting Lot 77J with Unit
2X.  The License Agreement was recorded in the Bureau of
Conveyances on January 27, 2000.  Grinpas I, at *1.  There is
nothing in the record evidencing that an easement document was
created or executed.  Grinpas I, at *2.
At some later time, Trustee acquired ownership of
Remnant 3.  In July 2002 Trustee sold Remnant 3 to KPL.  The DROA
contained provision C-67(A)(2)  that stated: "[t]ransaction
contingent upon [KPL]'s review and approval by 7/29/02 of: . . .
Grimpas [sic] Access Easement[.]"  Grinpas I, at *2.  KPL
received a preliminary title report that did not include any
reference to an access easement.  Grinpas I, at *2.  Trustee
conveyed Remnant 3 to KPL by way of a deed ( Trustee's Deed ) that
was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on August 28, 2002. 
The Trustee's Deed did not contain any provision for an easement
burdening Remnant 3.  Grinpas I, at *2.
In September 2003 the Grinpases, Hancock, and K382
settled disputes over verbal agreements concerning the use and
purchase of portions of the Kulana property by entering into the
Settlement Agreement .  The Settlement Agreement required, among
other things, that Hancock and K382 provide the Grinpases with an
easement through Remnant 3.  KPL owned Remnant 3 when the
Settlement Agreement was executed, but KPL was not a party to the
Settlement Agreement.  Grinpas I, at *3.  One way Hancock and
K382 could have performed under the Settlement Agreement would
have been for them to purchase an easement from KPL for the
benefit of the Grinpases' Lot 77J.
On December 14, 2004, the CPR Declaration  for the
Kulana Condominium was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.  A
map filed with the CPR Declaration showed Remnant 3 as part of
the condominium property regime, with an easement ( Remnant 3
Easement) in favor of the Grinpases' Lot 77J burdening Remnant 3. 
KPL did not sign the CPR Declaration, but on December 21, 2004,
KPL's Consent and Joinder  to the CPR Declaration was filed in the
Bureau of Conveyances.  Grinpas I, at *3.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On January 27, 2005, the First Amended Declaration  was
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.  KPL neither approved nor
consented to the First Amended Declaration.  On July 20, 2005,
the Second Amended Declaration , executed by KPL as "Remnant 3
Owner," was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.  The Second
Amended Declaration removed Remnant 3 from the Kulana
Condominium.  Grinpas I, at *3.
On July 16, 2007, the Apartment Deed  transferring
ownership of Unit 2X to the Grinpases was recorded in the Bureau
of Conveyances.  Unit 2X would have been connected to Lot 77J if
the Remnant 3 Easement (shown in the CPR Declaration) existed,
but KPL disputed the existence of the easement.  Grinpas I, at
*4.
B. Grinpases File Suit
On September 5, 2007, the Grinpases filed the action
below against K382, Hancock, and KPL.  They sought (1) a
declaration that the Remnant 3 Easement existed, (2) a mandatory
injunction for an easement through Remnant 3, and (3) an award of
damages.
On October 15, 2007, KPL answered the complaint,
counterclaimed against the Grinpases, and cross-claimed against
Hancock and K382.  On October 25, 2007, KPL filed an amended
counterclaim and cross-claim, and a third-party complaint against
Trustee.
Hancock answered the complaint and the amended cross-
claim on December 20, 2007.  He did not assert a cross-claim
against KPL for fraud.  He did not plead fraud as an affirmative
defense.
KPL filed a motion for partial summary judgment on
March 30, 2009, seeking a determination that there was no
easement burdening Remnant 3.  On April 21, 2009, the Grinpases
filed their own motion for partial summary judgment seeking a
determination that Remnant 3 was burdened by an easement.  The
Circuit Court heard the cross-motions on May 14, 2009, and took
them under advisement.  On August 3, 2009, the Circuit Court
entered an order granting KPL's motion and denying the
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Grinpases's motion, and a judgment in favor of KPL and against
the Grinpases, Hancock, and K382 (the Declaratory Judgment),
declaring "that there is no access and utilities easement in
favor of [the Grinpases, Lot 77J,] and/or Unit 2X over, across,
through or encumbering [Remnant 3]."  The Declaratory Judgment
specified that it "does not affect the License Agreement[.]"  The
Circuit Court certified the Declaratory Judgment as final
pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b)
(eff. 2000).  The Grinpases appealed.
While the Grinpases's appeal from the Declaratory
Judgment was pending before us, the Circuit Court conducted a
bench trial of the Grinpases's remaining claims against Hancock
and K382.  The Grinpases's written opening statement
acknowledged:
the [Circuit] Court has found that there is not a valid
easement through the Remnant 3, Kulana property (North
Easement), in favor of [the Grinpases].
Similarly, the Grinpases's proposed findings of fact and
conclusions of law stated:
16.KPL has maintained, and the Court has found that there
is not a valid easement through the Kulana Remnant 3
property, in favor of [the Grinpases].
17.[K]382 and Hancock are in breach of their agreements
with [the Grinpases] in that they have failed to convey a
valid easement in favor of [the Grinpases], through Kulana
Remnant 3, connecting [the Grinpases's] farm properties, to
wit Kulana Unit 2X and Grinpas Farms, Unit 3.
. . . .
26.Hancock and [K]382 have breached their agreement with
[the Grinpases] in that Hancock and [K]382 have failed to
perform their agreement to provide [the Grinpases] with a
permanent easement through the Kulana Remnant 3 property.
And the Grinpases's written closing argument argued:
the court has found that there is not a valid easement
through the remnant 3, Kulana property (north easement), in
favor of [the Grinpases].  Therefore, it is established as
the law of the case that Hancock, Hancock Trustee, and
[K]382 are in breach of their contractual obligations to
provide [the Grinpases] with the easement through remnant 3.
On October 23, 2009, the Circuit Court entered its
"Order Granting Final Judgment as to All Claims Set Forth in
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Plaintiffs['] Complaint Against Defendant William R. Hancock, and
Defendant Kapaa 382, LLC, a Hawaii [sic] Limited Liability
Company" ( October 2009 Order).  On October 23, 2009, a final
judgment was entered pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b) in favor of the
Grinpases and against Hancock and K382 in the amount of
$146,239.01 (Breach of Contract Judgment ).  The deadline to
appeal the Breach of Contract Judgment was November 23, 2009.  
No notice of appeal was filed.4
It does not appear that the parties informed us of the
Breach of Contract Judgment while the Grinpases's appeal from the
Declaratory Judgment was pending, because our February 15, 2012
memorandum opinion in Grinpas I contains no mention of it.  In
Grinpas I we vacated the Declaratory Judgment and remanded the
case to the Circuit Court because:
there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether KPL
intended to create easements via the Consent and Joinder. 
Moreover, if easements were created  by the Consent and
Joinder, there are genuine issues of material fact as to the
intent and meaning of the Second Amended Declaration, and
further, no evidence that the Grinpases agreed to
termination of any easements.
Grinpas I, at *7.
C. Proceedings on Remand
On January 28, 2013, KPL filed a motion for summary
judgment on the Grinpases' complaint.  KPL's motion was denied by
order entered on April 22, 2013.  That order is one of the
subjects of KPL's cross-appeal.
On February 15, 2013, Hancock filed a motion for
summary judgment against KPL on KPL's cross-claim.  Hancock's
motion was denied by order entered on March 22, 2013.  That order
is the subject of Hancock's appeal.
The Circuit Court conducted a bench trial from
April 29, 2013, until May 3, 2013, and on May 20, 2013.  On
June 28, 2013, KPL filed a declaration of counsel in support of
its claim for attorneys' fees.  KPL's request for attorneys' fees
4The thirtieth day after October 23, 2009, was Sunday, November 22,
2009.  Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 1-29 (1993).
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
was denied by order entered on August 15, 2013.  On October 22,
2013, the Circuit Court entered its Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law ( Findings & Conclusions).  The Findings &
Conclusions were expressly based upon the Circuit Court's
consideration of the credibility of the witnesses.   The Circuit
Court found that "KPL did not intend through the Consent and
Joinder to create or grant easements over Remnant 3[.]"
A judgment was entered on October 22, 2013.   An
amended judgment was entered on May 23, 2014.  Hancock and
Trustee filed a timely notice of appeal on June 3, 2014.  KPL
filed a timely cross-appeal on June 4, 2014.  By order entered on
February 28, 2019, we temporarily remanded this matter to the
Circuit Court pursuant to State v. Joshua, 141 Hawai# i 91, 93,
405 P.3d 527, 529 (2017), because Count III of the Grinpases'
complaint for damages against KPL was not resolved by either the
Breach of Contract Judgment or the May 23, 2014 amended judgment. 
The Second Amended Final Judgment was entered on March 15, 2019.5
II.
The Breach of Contract Judgment was entered pursuant to
HRCP Rule 54(b)  and was never appealed.  Thus it terminated the
action as to the claims and parties it addressed, cf. Commerce &
Indus. Ins. Co. v. Bank of Haw., 73 Haw. 322, 328-29, 832 P.2d6
5Hancock and KPL filed notices of appeal from the October 22, 2013
judgment but the appeals (Nos. CAAP-13-0005314 and CAAP-13-0005554) were
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
6HRCP Rule 54 provides, in relevant part:
(b) Judgment upon multiple claims or involving
multiple parties.  When more than one claim for relief is
presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim,
cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties
are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final
judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims
or parties only upon an express determination that there is
no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for
the entry of judgment.  In the absence of such determination
and direction, any order or other form of decision, however
designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or
the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties
shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or
parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject
to revision at any time before the entry of judgment
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities
of all the parties.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
733, 736-37 (1992) (implying that Rule 54(b)-certified judgment
terminating sole potentially covered claim would have terminated
liability insurer's duty to defend against remaining non-covered
claims), and the following findings of fact contained in the
October 2009 Order are final and binding on the Grinpases and
Hancock and their respective privies:  (1) Hancock agreed to
provide the Grinpases with an easement through Remnant 3;
(2) Hancock failed to convey an easement through Remnant 3 to the
Grinpases; (3) the Grinpases' only alternative to connect Lot 77
and Unit 2X was to purchase an easement through another property
and to construct a new road; and (4) the Grinpases sustained
damages of $114,500 because of Hancock's failure to convey an
easement through Remnant 3.87
In addition, the doctrine of "law of the case" applies
to the legal issues decided in Grinpas I.  Ditto v. McCurdy, 98
Hawai#i 123, 128, 44 P.3d 274, 279 (2002).  Thus, DROA provision
C-67(A)(2) did not create an express easement over Remnant 3 in
favor of the Grinpases.  Grinpas I, at *6.  The Trustee's Deed
"accurately reflects that there was no express easement over
Remnant 3 at that time."  Grinpas I, at *6.  The only possibility
for the Grinpases to be entitled to an easement over Remnant 3
would be if "KPL intended to create easements via the Consent and
Joinder."  Grinpas I, at *7.  It is within this framework that we
examine the current appeal and cross-appeal.
A. Hancock's Appeal
Hancock's opening brief fails to comply with Hawai#i
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) (eff. 2010). 
It appears he is appealing from the denial of his February 15,
2013 motion for summary judgment against KPL (Hancock's MSJ ).  An
7"Collateral estoppel, also referred to as issue preclusion, may
preclude the relitigation of a fact or issue that was previously determined in
a prior action on a different claim or cause of action between the same
parties or their privies and applies if the particular issue in question was
actually litigated, finally decided, and essential to the earlier valid and
final judgment."  Uyeda v. Schermer, 144 Hawai #i 163, 173, 439 P.3d 115, 125
(2019) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
8The balance of the $146,239.01 judgment represented an award of
damages based upon the Grinpases also not having an easement over property
other than Remnant 3, and an award of costs.
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
appellate court reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion for
summary judgment de novo using the same standard applied by the
trial court.  Nozawa v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3,
142 Hawai#i 331, 338, 418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018).  
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. 
A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties.  
Id. at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198 (citations, quotation marks and
brackets omitted).
Hancock's MSJ argued that: (1) the Trustee's Deed was
fraudulently altered to remove reference to the Remnant 3
Easement after Trustee signed it but before it was recorded; and
(2) an attorney who allegedly represented KPL was aware of the
purported Remnant 3 Easement, which knowledge should have been
imputed to KPL.  These arguments fail for a number of reasons.
Hancock's answer to KPL's cross-claim did not assert
fraud as an affirmative defense.  Hancock never asserted a fraud
claim against KPL.  Trustee never responded to KPL's third-party
complaint, and Trustee's default was entered on March 12, 2009.   
Trustee never asserted a fraud claim against KPL.  Hancock's and
Trustee's failure to plead fraud – either as a claim or an
affirmative defense – bars them from contending that KPL
fraudulently altered the Trustee's Deed.  See HRCP Rule 8(c)
(eff. 2000); State ex rel. Office of Consumer Protection v.
Honolulu Univ. of Arts, Sci. & Humanities, 110 Hawai# i 504, 516,
135 P.3d 113, 125 (2006).9
In addition, Hancock's contention of fraud and his
argument about KPL's attorney's knowledge being imputed to KPL
are both predicated upon the existence of an easement actually
burdening Remnant 3.  That is inconsistent with the findings of
fact set forth in the October 2009 Order which, because the
9KPL waived the default because Trustee appeared and participated
(through counsel) in the 2013 bench trial of KPL's counterclaim, cross-claim,
and third-party complaint without objection from KPL.
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Breach of Contract Judgment is final and non-appealable,
precludes Hancock from relitigating the issue of whether
Remnant 3 is burdened by an easement in favor of the Grinpases,
Lot 77J, and/or Unit 2X.  The Trustee's Deed could not have been
altered to eliminate reference to an easement that did not exist
nor could knowledge of an easement be imputed to KPL if the
easement never existed.10
,
Finally, in Grinpas I we noted that the preliminary
title report for Remnant 3 obtained by KPL did not include any
reference to an easement, and stated:
There is nothing in the record evidencing that an "easement
document" as contemplated in Hancock's July 24, 2002 letter
[to KPL] was created or executed.
. . . The Trustee's Deed did not contain any provision concerning
the Grinpases' alleged easement.
Grinpas I, at *2.  The law of the case is that the Trustee's Deed
"accurately reflects that there was no express easement over
Remnant 3 at that time."  Grinpas I, at *6.  The issues remanded
were:
whether KPL intended to create easements via the Consent and
Joinder.  Moreover, if easements were created by the Consent
and Joinder, there are genuine issues of material fact as to
the intent and meaning of the Second Amended Declaration,
and further, no evidence that the Grinpases agreed to
termination of any easements.
Grinpas I, at *7.  The issues we remanded were material only
because KPL's intention to create an easement by signing the
Consent and Joinder would be the only way that an easement
burdening Remnant 3 could exist.  The Circuit Court did not err
in denying Hancock's MSJ.
B. KPL's Cross-Appeal
KPL raises four points of error.  KPL's second and
third points of error do not comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(C)
10Hancock contends that he did not realize the Trustee's Deed had
been altered until some time after he retained counsel in December 2012, but
neither Hancock nor Trustee moved for relief from the Breach of Contract
Judgment under HRCP Rule 59 (eff. 2000) (new trials; amendment of judgments)
or HRCP Rule 60 (eff. 2006) (relief from judgment).
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
because they do not specify which of the Findings & Conclusions
KPL contends are erroneous.
1. Election of remedies
KPL first contends that the Circuit Court erred in
denying KPL's January 28, 2013 motion for summary judgment
against the Grinpases.  The motion argued that the Grinpases
elected their remedy by obtaining the Breach of Contract Judgment
against Hancock and K382.  Since the Breach of Contract Judgment
was predicated on the Grinpases not having an easement over
Remnant 3, KPL argues that the Grinpases should not have been
allowed to obtain further relief based on their having such an
easement.  As the Grinpases correctly point out, the ruling on
KPL's election of remedies motion is moot because no party has
appealed from the Circuit Court's finding that KPL did not intend
to create easements via the Consent and Joinder.
2. KPL's counterclaim against the Grinpases
KPL's second point of error contends that the Circuit
Court "erred in ruling that the Grinpases did not tortiously
interfere with KPL's property rights or conspire to commit such
tortious interference . . . with Hancock/K382[.]"  It appears
that KPL is challenging the following conclusions of law made by
the Circuit Court:
10.The Court finds that Grinpas did not engage in
tortious conduct in their attempts to secure an easement
over Remnant 3.
. . . .
12.The Court finds that Grinpas did not conspire to
wrongfully interfere with KPL's use and enjoyment of
Remnant 3.
A trial court's label of a finding of fact or a conclusion of law
is not determinative of the standard of review.  Crosby v. State
Dep't of Budget & Fin., 76 Hawai# i 332, 340, 876 P.2d 1300, 1308
(1994).  The Circuit Court's conclusions 10 and 12 present mixed
questions of fact and law.  When a conclusion of law presents
mixed questions of fact and law, we review it under the "clearly
erroneous" standard because the trial court's conclusions are
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
dependent on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. 
Estate of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai#i 332, 351, 152
P.3d 504, 523 (2007).  A mixed finding of fact and conclusion of
law is clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial
evidence to support it or when, despite some evidence to support
it, we are left with the definite and firm conviction in
reviewing all of the evidence that a mistake has been committed. 
Id.  "[S]ubstantial evidence" is "credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion."  In re Grievance
Arbitration Between State of Haw. Org. of Police Officers, 135
Hawai#i 456, 462, 353 P.3d 998, 1004 (2015) (citations omitted).
a. Tortious interference with property rights
KPL does not cite, nor have we found, any reported
Hawai#i appellate decision recognizing a cause of action for
"tortious interference with property rights."   In describing
its cross-claim against Hancock and K382, KPL's opening brief
explains: "KPL's claims of 'wrongful interference with Remnant 3'
sound in trespass."  KPL cites to the Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 158 (Am. Law Inst. 1965), which states:11
§ 158 Liability for Intentional Intrusions on Land
One is subject to liability to another for trespass,
irrespective of whether he [or she] thereby causes harm to
any legally protected interest of the other, if he [or she]
intentionally
(a)enters land in the possession of the other, or
causes a thing or a third person to do so, or
(b)remains on the land, or
(c)fails to remove from the land a thing which he
[or she] is under a duty to remove.
Comment b. to § 158 states, in relevant part:
Unless the context otherwise indicates, the phrase "enters
land" is for convenience used throughout the Restatement of
this Subject to include, not only coming upon land, but also
11Cf. Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 Hawai#i 40, 50, 890 P.2d 277, 287 (1995)
(tortious interference with contractual relations); Minton v. Quintal, 131
Hawai#i 
167, 191, 317 P.3d 1, 25 (2013) (tortious interference with
prospective business advantage).
12NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
remaining on it, and, in addition, to include the presence
upon the land of a third person or thing which the actor has
caused to be or to remain there.
KPL's opening brief contains nothing to disclaim that KPL's
tortious interference counterclaim against the Grinpases also
sounds in trespass.  Even if the Hawai# i Supreme Court were to
adopt the Restatement's definition of "trespass," KPL cites no
evidence in the record showing that either of the Grinpases
entered, remained, or caused any other person or thing to be
present on Remnant 3, other than pursuant to the License
Agreement.  The Findings & Conclusions state that "[t]he Court
finds that Grinpas did not breach the license agreement or engage
in conduct warranting rescission of the license agreement."
There is no evidence that the Grinpases "trespassed" on Remnant 3
at any time while Remnant 3 was owned by KPL.12
Moreover, the Restatement (Second) of Torts contains
the following scope note to the chapter that includes § 158:
[T]hese Chapters deal only with the interest of the
possessor in holding his [or her] land free from physical
intrusions by others.  They do not deal with the invasion of
other interests of the possessor of land, such as his [or
her] interest in its enjoyment free from annoyances other
than physical intrusions, or his [or her] interest in its
vendibility.
Restatement (Second) of Torts One 7 1 Scope Note (underscoring
added).  As we have noted, KPL points to no evidence before the
Circuit Court that the Grinpases physically intruded upon Remnant
3 other than as permitted by the License Agreement.   As to
KPL's interest in Remnant 3's vendibility, KPL's counterclaim did
not plead a cause of action for slander of title.   Nor has KPL1413
12KPL has not appealed from this finding.
13KPL's reply brief admits that its claims against the Grinpases
"are not based on the Grinpases' limited use of a small portion of Remnant 3
under the terms of their license agreement with Hancock/[K382]." (Emphasis
omitted.)
14To establish a claim for slander of title the plaintiff must
prove:
(1) ownership of or interest in the property by the
plaintiff; (2) falsity of the words published; (3) malice of
the defendant in publishing the false statements;

cited to any evidence before the Circuit Court necessary to prove
a prima facie claim for slander of title, such as the existence
of a purchaser who canceled a sales contract (which would also
have supported a claim for tortious interference with contractual
relations)15 or of a prospective purchaser who declined to sign a
sales contract (which would also have supported a claim for
tortious interference with prospective business advantage).  
Conclusion of law no. 10 is not clearly erroneous and was a
correct application of the law.16
b. Civil conspiracy
KPL contends that the Grinpases conspired with Hancock
and K382 "[b]y attempting to create easements encumbering
Remnant 3 without KPL's assent or knowledge," and that the
Circuit Court erred by ruling:
The fact that Mr. Grinpas tries to secure an
easement, I don't view that as Mr. Grinpas engaging in
some tortious behavior.  He's just trying to get
something that he thought he had way back from the
very beginning.  And so I don't find that it was
tortious behavior on the part of Mr. Grinpas and when
I say Mr. Grinpas, Mr. and Mrs. Grinpas.
The Hawai#i Supreme Court has defined civil conspiracy
as the "combination of two or more persons or entities by
concerted action to accomplish a criminal or unlawful purpose, or
to accomplish some purpose not in itself criminal or unlawful by
criminal or unlawful means."  Robert's Haw. Sch. Bus, Inc. v.

(2006).  The supreme court explained that "[c]ivil conspiracy
does not alone constitute a claim for relief."  Robert's Haw., at
260 n.44, 982 P.2d at 889 n.44 (citations omitted).  "In other
words, concerted action is not enough[;] [a] civil conspiracy
claim must include either that the alleged conspirators had a
criminal or unlawful purpose for their concerted action or that
the alleged conspirators used criminal or unlawful means to
accomplish a lawful objective."  Miyashiro v. Roehrig, Roehrig,
Wilson & Hara, 122 Hawai#i 461, 482, 228 P.3d 341, 362 (App.
2010) (emphasis omitted).
It is not criminal or unlawful to establish or acquire
an easement; KPL's claim must be that the Grinpases, Hancock, and
K382 conspired to create an easement by criminal or unlawful
means.  KPL argues that the Grinpases conspired with Hancock and
K382 by entering into the Settlement Agreement, which required
(among other things) that Hancock and K382 provide the Grinpases
with an easement through Remnant 3.  This was not a "criminal or
unlawful purpose" because Hancock and K382 could have performed
by purchasing an easement from KPL with the Grinpases as either
intended or incidental third-party beneficiaries of the easement
purchase agreement.  Hancock's and K382's purchasing an easement
from KPL would not be a "criminal or unlawful means" for them to
obtain an easement for the Grinpases.  Although the Circuit Court
focused on the Grinpases' intent, its conclusion of law no. 12
"that [the] Grinpas[es] did not conspire to wrongfully interfere
with KPL's use and enjoyment of Remnant 3" was correct.  See,
e.g., Poe v. Hawaii Labor Relations Bd., 87 Hawai#i 191, 197, 953
P.2d 569, 575 (1998) (if upon review the circuit court's decision
is correct, the decision "will not be disturbed on the ground
that it gave the wrong reason for its ruling"); Enos v. Pac.
Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 79 Hawai# i 452, 459, 903 P.2d 1273,
1280 (1995) (appellate court may affirm judgment of lower court
on any ground in the record that supports affirmance); State v.
Taniguchi, 72 Haw. 235, 239, 815 P.2d 24, 26 (1991) ("[W]e have
consistently held that where the decision below is correct it
must be affirmed by the appellate court even though the lower
tribunal gave the wrong reason for its action."); Strouss v.

Simmons, 66 Haw. 32, 40, 657 P.2d 1004, 1010 (1982) ("An
appellate court may affirm a judgment of the lower court on any
ground in the record which supports affirmance.").  Conclusion of
law no. 12 is not clearly erroneous and was a correct application
of the law.
3. KPL's cross-claim against Hancock and K382
KPL's third point of error contends that the Circuit
Court erred "in ruling that Hancock/K382 did not tortiously
interfere with KPL's property rights, conspire to commit such
tortious interference, or commit negligent or fraudulent
misrepresentation."  It appears that KPL is challenging the
following conclusions of law made by the Circuit Court:
16.The Court finds that Hancock and K382 did not
engage in negligent or knowing misrepresentations or failure
to disclose material facts regarding the 1999 license
agreement, the 2003 settlement agreement, or the K382 CPR
documents.
. . . .
18.The Court finds that Hancock and K382 did not
wrongfully interfere with KPL's use and enjoyment of Remnant
3 by attempting [to] create easements encumbering Remnant 3
without KPL's consent.
. . . .
20.The Court finds that Hancock and K382 did not
fraudulently induce KPL to execute a 2005 amendment to the
K382 CPR Declaration and quitclaim deeds.
. . . .
22.The Court finds that Hancock and Kapaa 382 did
not conspire to wrongfully interfere with KPL's use and
enjoyment of Remnant 3.
. . . .
35.The Court finds that Hancock did not
fraudulently induce KPL to execute a 2005 amendment to the
K382 CPR Declaration and quitclaim deeds.
. . . .
37.The Court finds that Hancock did not conspire to
wrongfully interfere with KPL's use and enjoyment of
Remnant 3.
16NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
a. Tortious interference with property rights
As we noted above, KPL's claims for "'wrongful
interference with Remnant 3' sound in trespass.".  Even if the
Hawai#i Supreme Court were to adopt the Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 158 definition of "trespass," attempting to create an
easement encumbering real property is not a trespass.  KPL cites
no evidence in the record showing that Hancock or K382 trespassed
on Remnant 3, as the term is used in Restatement § 158, at any
time while Remnant 3 was owned by KPL.
KPL argues that it presented evidence showing that as a
result of Hancock's and K382's attempts to encumber Remnant 3
with an easement and the Grinpases' efforts to impose their
claimed easement through this lawsuit, KPL has not been able to
CPR its property and sell up to two units as intended, and that
this has resulted in diminution in market value and lost profits. 
As discussed above, KPL's cross-claim did not plead a cause of
action for slander of title, nor has KPL cited to any evidence
necessary to prove the "special damages" element of a prima facie
claim for slander of title, Isobe, 127 Hawai# i at 378, 279 P.3d
at 43, such as the existence of an actual purchaser who canceled
a sales contract (which would also have supported a claim for
tortious interference with contractual relations) or of a
prospective purchaser who actually declined to sign a sales
contract (which would also have supported a claim for tortious
interference with prospective business advantage).  Conclusion of
law no. 18 is not clearly erroneous and was a correct application
of the law.
b. Civil conspiracy
As we noted above, Hancock and K382 did not conspire
with the Grinpases to wrongfully interfere with KPL's use and
enjoyment of Remnant 3.  Conclusion of law no. 22 is not clearly
erroneous and was a correct application of the law.
c. Misrepresentation
"Negligent misrepresentation has the following
elements: (1) false information be supplied as a result of the
17NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
failure to exercise reasonable care or competence in
communicating the information; (2) the person for whose benefit
the information is supplied suffered the loss; and (3) the
recipient relies upon the misrepresentation."  Santiago v.
Tanaka, 137 Hawai# i 137, 153-54, 366 P.3d 612, 628-29 (2016)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   17
KPL argues that Hancock and K382 represented that the
Consent and Joinder KPL signed on December 21, 2004, "was the
mechanism by which KPL would obtain CPR lots on Remnant 3."  To
the extent KPL's claim is based upon Hancock's and K382's failure
to actually obtain a CPR of Remnant 3 for KPL:
[F]raud cannot be predicated on statements which are
promissory in their nature, or constitute expressions of
intention, and an actionable representation cannot consist
of mere broken promises, unfulfilled predictions or
expectations, or erroneous conjectures as to future events,
even if there is no excuse for failure to keep the promise,
and even though a party acted in reliance on such promise.
Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc., 94 Hawai#i 368, 386, 14 P.3d 1049,
1067 (2000) (alteration in original) (citation and emphasis
omitted).
To the extent KPL's claim is based upon Hancock and
K382 fraudulently inducing KPL to sign the Consent and Joinder in
order to secretly create an easement for the Grinpases over
Remnant 3, any harm to KPL was remedied on July 20, 2005, when
the Second Amended Declaration (executed by KPL as "Remnant 3
Owner") was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.  The Second
Amended Declaration removed Remnant 3 from the Kulana
Condominium, Grinpas I, at *3-4, and effectively rescinded the
Consent and Joinder.  See Exotics Hawaii–Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du
Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai#i 277, 289, 172 P.3d 1021, 1033
(2007) ("[W]e believe a defrauded party should be afforded the
choice of remedies, i.e., rescission or an independent action for
damages.") (italics omitted).
Finally, to the extent Hancock and K382 fraudulently
induced KPL to sign the Consent and Joinder in order to secretly
17KPL's opening brief does not address the issue of intentional
misrepresentation, which waives the issue on appeal. See Dement v. Atkins &
Ash, 2 Haw. App. 324, 327, 631 P.2d 606, 609 (1981).
18NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
create an easement for the Grinpases over Remnant 3, KPL
sustained no actual loss.  The Circuit Court correctly stated
that the issue on remand was "whether KPL intended to create and
grant Grinpas' [sic] claimed easement when it entered into a
consent and joinder in 2004."  See Grinpas I, at *8 ("The point
of contention in this case is whether by[ ]executing the Consent
and Joinder, KPL intended to create the easements reflected in
the 26A/26E Map.").  The Circuit Court made the following
findings of fact, none of which are challenged by KPL:
25.KPL did not intend, agree or consent to being
included in the K382 CPR.
26.Rather, KPL intended to have its own separate
condominium property regime for Remnant 3.
. . . .
27.Hancock promised KPL that he would create and
pay for a separate CPR for Remnant 3.
28.KPL executed a Consent and Joinder with the
intent of creating a CPR project separate and apart from the
K382 CPR development.  The Court believes KPL hoped to
market its development before K382 and Hancock could market
the K382 CPR.
29.In November 2004, Dustin Crane [the managing
member of KPL] was provided with a Consent and Joinder.
. . . .
31.Dustin Crane understood that the Consent and
Joinder related to Remnant 3's CPR.
32.Dustin Crane signed the Consent and Joinder with
the intent that KPL would be obtaining its own CPR separate
and apart from the K382 CPR.
33.KPL did not intend by the Consent and Joinder to
submit Remnant 3 to the K382 CPR.
34.KPL did not intend through the Consent and
Joinder to create or grant easements over Remnant 3 . . .
benefitting Grinpas or Grinpas' [sic] Property.
KPL's Remnant 3 is not burdened by an easement and is not subject
to the K382 CPR.  Conclusions of law nos. 16, 20, 35, and 37 are
not clearly erroneous and were a correct application of the law.
19NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4. Uyemura v. Wick
KPL's final point of error contends that the Circuit
Court "erred in denying KPL's request for attorney [sic] fees
under Uyemura v. Wick."  The request was made in one sentence in
KPL's closing brief, filed with the Circuit Court on June 3,
2013:
In addition, Hancock's misrepresentations regarding the
Kulana CPR documents and failure to disclose to KPL the
Settlement Agreement and easements AU-26A and AU-26E
entitles KPL to a grant of attorneys' fees against Hancock
under Uyemura v. Wick, 57 Haw. 102, 109, 551 P.2d 171, 176
(1976).
The Circuit Court's order denying KPL's request for attorneys'
fees was entered on August 15, 2013. 
Uyemura involved the sale of a lot in a subdivision. 
Wick Realty was the sales agent for the developer.  One of Wick
Realty's brokers agreed to sell the lot to Uyemura and received
Uyemura's $100 initial deposit,  not realizing that another Wick
Realty broker had put a "hold" on the same lot for the Chungs. 
The Chungs decided to buy the lot and paid a $500 deposit.  Wick
Realty decided to honor the hold, informed Uyemura that it had
sold the lot to the Chungs, and returned Uyemura's deposit. 
Uyemura paid an additional deposit due under her sales contract. 
Wick Realty returned the additional deposit to Uyemura with
another explanation that the lot had been sold to the Chungs. 
Uyemura sued Wick Realty and the developer for specific
performance.  In the meantime, the sale to the Chungs closed. 
When Uyemura found out the lot had been sold, she joined the
Chungs as defendants.  The Chungs filed a cross-claim against
Wick Realty.  The trial court denied Uyemura's request for
specific performance on the ground that the Chungs were bona fide
purchasers, but awarded Uyemura money damages.  The trial court
also awarded the Chungs $500 as attorneys' fees and costs.  Wick
Realty appealed.  The supreme court affirmed the award of18
18The transactions at issue happened in 1972.
20NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
attorneys' fees and costs.  After stating that attorneys' fees
ordinarily cannot be awarded unless authorized by statute,
stipulation, or agreement, the supreme court noted:
However, it is generally held that where the wrongful act of
the defendant has involved the plaintiff in litigation with
others, or placed [the plaintiff] in such relation with
others as makes it necessary to incur expenses to protect
his [or her] interest, such expenses, including attorneys'
fees, should be treated as the legal consequences of the
original wrongful act, and may be recovered as damages.
Uyemura, 57 Haw. at 108-09, 551 P.2d at 176.  Quoting 1 S.
Speiser, Attorneys' Fees, § 13:4 (1973), the court held:
In order to recover attorneys' fees under this principal,
the plaintiff must establish:
(1)that the plaintiff had become involved in a legal
dispute either because of a breach of contract by the
defendant, or because of defendant's tortious conduct,
that is, that the party sought to be charged with the
fees was guilty of a wrongful or negligent act or
breach of agreement ;
(2)that the litigation was with a third party, not with
the defendant from whom the fees are sought to be
recovered;
(3)that the attorneys' fees were incurred in that
third-party litigation; and 
(4)whether the fees and expenses were incurred as a
result of defendant's breach of contract or tort, that
they are the natural and necessary consequences of the
defendant's act, since remote, uncertain, and
contingent consequences do not afford a basis for
recovery[.]
Id. at 109, 551 P.2d at 176 (reformatted and emphasis added).
In this case, we have affirmed the Circuit Court's
conclusion of law no. 16 that "Hancock and K382 did not engage in
negligent or knowing misrepresentations or failure to disclose
material facts regarding the . . . 2003 settlement agreement,[ ]
or the K382 CPR documents [purported to include Remnant 3 in the
CPR and which showed easements AU-26A and AU-26E encumbering19
19In support of its Uyemura claim, KPL argues that Hancock's failure
to disclose the existence of the Settlement Agreement to KPL caused KPL to be
sued by the Grinpases.  There was nothing to disclose when KPL purchased
Remnant 3 because the Settlement Agreement was not executed until September
2003, more than a year after KPL purchased Remnant 3.
21NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Remnant 3].[ ]"  (Footnotes added.)  Having failed to prove a
breach of contract or tortious conduct by Hancock or K382, KPL is
not entitled to recover the attorneys' fees it incurred to
litigate against the Grinpases from Hancock or K382 under
Uyemura.20
In addition, the record reflects that the Grinpases did
not sue KPL because Hancock or K382 breached a contract with KPL
or a tort duty owed to KPL.  The Grinpases' complaint made the
following allegations against KPL:
41.In late 2006 through the early months of 2007,
[the Grinpases] had several communications with Dustin Crane
who communicated on behalf of [KPL].  In all of these
communications Mr. Crane did clearly express that [KPL] did
agree to execute the access and utilities easement in favor
of Unit 3.
42.On March 6, 2007, Dustin Crane did call
Plaintiff Robert Grinpas and did advise that he and the
other partners of [KPL] were on [Kaua #i] and requested a
meeting that same day in order to resolve some matters
concerning the easement.
43.Plaintiff, ROBERT GRINPAS did meet with all of
the partners of [KPL] on March 6, 2007.  At that meeting,
for the first time [KPL] questioned whether or not they were
obligated to convey the access and utilities easement
through Remnant 3, to [the Grinpases].  At that meeting the
partners of [KPL] said that they had an offer which
presented a "win - win situation", and they offered to grant
the access and utilities easement only on the condition that
[the Grinpases] grant reciprocal easements to [KPL] through
Unit 2X, and otherwise grant rights to [KPL], which [the
Grinpases] were otherwise not obligated to do, and to which
[KPL] was not otherwise entitled.
. . . .
46.[KPL] continue[s] to refuse to convey the access
and utilities easement through [R]emnant 3 to [the
Grinpases], unless [the Grinpases] convey interests in
Kulana Unit 2X to [KPL], as aforesaid.
20In support of its Uyemura claim, KPL argues that it was sued by
the Grinpases because of "Hancock's misrepresentations regarding the Kulana
CPR documents[.]"  KPL acquired Remnant 3 in July 2002.  The Trustee's Deed
was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on August 28, 2002.  The CPR
Declaration for the Kulana Condominium was recorded in the Bureau of
Conveyances more than two years later, on December 14, 2004.  Even if KPL had
been misled into signing the Consent and Joinder in 2004, the Second Amended
Declaration — which removed Remnant 3 from the Kulana Condominium CPR — was
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on July 20, 2005, more than two years
before the Grinpases sued KPL.
22NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Grinpases sued KPL because:
52.On or about March 6, 2007, [KPL] perceived that
[it] had an opportunity to take advantage of the situation
and realize additional advantages at [the Grinpases']
expense, to which [KPL] knew that [it was] not lawfully
entitled.
In other words, the Grinpases sued KPL because KPL would not
convey an easement over Remnant 3 on terms acceptable to the
Grinpases.
Finally, KPL argues that "Hancock/K382's misconduct and
breach of the [S]ettlement [A]greement naturally resulted in
KPL's expenditure of significant costs and fees in defending
itself in this lawsuit initiated by the Grinpases."  Even if
Hancock and K382 had breached tort or contract duties they owed
to the Grinpases, and the Grinpases had sued KPL as a result, KPL
would not be able to recover its attorneys' fees from KPL under
Uyemura; Uyemura only applies when the party from whom the fees
are sought (in this case, Hancock/K382) breached a tort or
contract duty owed to the party seeking recovery (in this case,
KPL).
In Uyemura the supreme court construed the record to
reflect that Wick Realty fraudulently concealed from the Chungs
that litigation by Uyemura concerning the lot was imminent or
pending.  On that basis the court concluded that the Chungs were
entitled to recover the attorneys' fees and costs incurred to
defend against Uyemura's lawsuit as damages from Wick Realty. 
Id. at 110, 551 P.2d at 176.  In Uyemura, the Chungs were able to
recover attorneys' fees as damages from Wick Realty because Wick
Realty breached a duty owed to the Chungs, which caused the
Chungs to become involved in litigation against Uyemura.  Had
Wick Realty disclosed to the Chungs that litigation with Uyemura
over the lot was imminent or pending, the Chungs may have chosen
not to close their transaction, which would have obviated the
need for Uyemura to join them as defendants in her lawsuit
against Wick Realty.
23NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The two reported Hawai# i appellate decisions21 that have
discussed Uyemura also stand for the proposition that the party
claiming attorneys' fees as damages must show that the party from
whom the fees are sought breached a duty owed to the claimant,
which resulted in the claimant having to litigate against a third
party.  In Occidental Underwriters of Haw., Ltd. v. American Sec.
Bank, 5 Haw. App. 431, 696 P.2d 852 (1985), Occidental insured
real property owned by PJV, subject to a mortgage in favor of
American Security Bank ( Bank).  Occidental sued PJV and the Bank
for premiums due.  PJV cross-claimed against the Bank, claiming
that the Bank caused Occidental to insure the property and was
liable to PJV under Uyemura for PJV being sued by Occidental. 
Occidental and the Bank settled the premium payment dispute.  PJV
moved for summary judgment on its cross-claim against the Bank
and the Bank moved for summary judgment on PJV's cross-claim. 
The trial court denied PJV's motion and granted the Bank's
motion.  PJV appealed.  We held that the trial court correctly
denied PJV's motion, but we reversed the summary judgment in
favor of the Bank.  We held that "there is a genuine issue of
material fact whether [the Bank]'s failure to pay the insurance
premium owed to [Occidental] was a wrongful or negligent act or
breach of agreement vis-a-vis PJV[.]"   Occidental, 5 Haw. App.
at 434, 696 P.2d at 854 (emphasis added).  This would be the case
if, for example, the terms of the loan or mortgage required that
the Bank pay the property insurance premiums from an escrow
account funded from PJV's loan payments.
In Lee v. Aiu, 85 Hawai# i 19, 936 P.2d 655 (1997), Lee
and Aiu owned a house as joint tenants.  Disputes arose between
them over ownership of the house.  They agreed to sell it, with
$25,000 of the proceeds going to Aiu and Lee retaining the
21A third case, Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g & Erection, Inc., 87
Hawai#i 37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998), discussed an award of attorneys' fees in
connection with an appeal.  After holding that an award of costs and fees to a
prevailing party is essentially an award of damages that may involve certain
factual determinations, the supreme court held that "appellate courts have
jurisdiction to make factual determinations in the limited context of taxing
attorneys' fees and costs incurred on appeal."  Id. at 52, 951 P.2d at 502
(emphasis omitted).  Although the Fought opinion discussed Uyemura, the
attorneys' fee awards were made pursuant to HRS § 607-14 (1997) ("Attorneys'
fees in actions in the nature of assumpsit, etc."), not as common law damages
under Uyemura.
24NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
balance ( Settlement Agreement ).  Aiu retained Dixon, who was a
licensed attorney and also a realtor.  Dixon and his wife
(Pearson-Dixon ), also a realtor, convinced Aiu to sell his
interest in the house to them for $25,000 — even though Dixon
originally advised Aiu that Aiu's equity in the house was
probably worth $50-55,000 and that $25,000 was a "ridiculous" sum
of money for his interest.  Aiu moved to the mainland without
telling Lee what he had done.  Lee learned about it when Pearson-
Dixon wrote Lee a letter declaring the Dixons's ownership of a
one-half undivided interest in the house, advising Lee that
because the Dixons had not assumed the mortgage, Lee must
continue to pay the mortgage or risk foreclosure, cautioning Lee
not to commit waste, and suggesting that Lee consider a lower
selling price for the house in order to achieve a faster sale. 
Lee then sued Aiu and the Dixons claiming, among other things,
specific performance of the Settlement Agreement by Aiu and
tortious interference with contractual relations ( TICR) by the
Dixons.
The case was tried to a jury.  The trial court did not
allow Lee to introduce evidence of her attorneys' fees incurred
in litigating with Aiu as an element of damages in her TICR claim
against the Dixons.  The jury found that: (1) when the house was
purchased, Lee and Aiu agreed that Lee would be the sole owner
and that Aiu would be on the title in name only; (2) there was a
binding and enforceable agreement wherein Aiu agreed to sell his
rights and interests in the house to Lee for $25,000; (3) Aiu
breached that agreement; (4) Lee suffered damages as a result of
the breach; and (5) such damages amounted to $15,000.  The trial
court set aside the jury's findings and awarded damages to Lee in
an amount less than what the jury awarded.  The Dixons appealed
and Lee cross-appealed.
After discussing the evidence presented at trial, the
supreme court reinstated the jury's findings and remanded with
instructions to enter an order equitably reforming the deed to
reflect Lee as the sole owner of the house.  Id. at 31, 936 P.2d
at 667.  The supreme court affirmed the trial court's denial of
Lee's request for an award of attorneys' fees under HRS § 607-14,

holding that a suit to enforce an agreement is an action for
specific performance of a contract, not an action in the nature
of assumpsit.  Id. at 31-32, 936 P.2d at 667-68.  Of relevance to
the case now before us is the supreme court's ruling that the
trial court erred in not allowing Lee to introduce evidence of
the attorneys' fees she incurred in litigating with Aiu as an
element of damages in her tort claim against the Dixons.  After
discussing Uyemura, the supreme court held:
Lee became involved in a legal dispute with Aiu because of
the Dixons' tortious interference with the contractual
relation between Lee and Aiu.  As a natural and necessary
consequence of the Dixons' tortious interference, Lee was
required to litigate with Aiu, which in turn caused her to
incur attorney's [sic] fees.  Although some jurisdictions
have held that this exception to the American Rule does not
apply where the plaintiff consolidates his or her actions
against both the contract breacher (in this case, Aiu) and
the tortfeasor (in this case, the Dixons), we are in accord
with those jurisdictions that hold that it is of no
consequence whether the actions are brought together or
separately. . . . [W]e see no reason why attorneys' fees
should be recoverable when the aggrieved party files
separate lawsuits against the contract breacher and the
tortfeasor, but should be denied when he [or she]
consolidates both into one law suit.
Id. at 33, 936 P.2d at 669 (emphasis added) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted).  The parties from whom fees
were sought (the Dixons) breached a tort duty owed to the party
seeking fees (Lee), who became involved in litigation against a
third-party (Aiu) as a result.  The supreme court remanded the
case for a new trial on the issue of damages, with instructions
that Lee be allowed to introduce evidence of the attorneys' fees
she incurred in litigation with Aiu that were caused by the
Dixons's tortious interference with the Settlement Agreement.  In
this case, the Grinpases sued KPL for an easement because Hancock
and K382 breached their duty — owed to the Grinpases, not to KPL
— to procure an easement over KPL's property.  The Circuit Court
correctly denied attorneys' fees to KPL under Uyemura v. Wick.
