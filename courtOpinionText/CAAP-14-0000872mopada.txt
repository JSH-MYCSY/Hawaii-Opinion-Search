The Kohatsus contend that the circuit court erred in
 
denying their amended partial summary judgment motion and in
 
granting Defendant-Appellee State Farm Mutual Automobile
 Insurance Company's (State Farm) partial summary judgment motion. 
The Kohatsus assert the circuit court erred by concluding that:
 
(1) the language of the Kohatsus' automobile insurance policy was not ambiguous; (2) State Farm's stacking option offer was sufficient pursuant to Macabio v. TIG Ins. Co., 87 Hawai
'i 307, 
955 P.2d 100 (1998); and (3) there was no genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment for State Farm. Additionally, the Kohatsus contend the circuit court should have concluded that the Kohatsus' automobile insurance policy provided that State Farm would pay any amount due when arbitration is invoked and an award is rendered. 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.
 
I. Background
 
The parties do not dispute the following facts. Ellen 
was involved in an automobile accident in Hilo, Hawai
'i, which 
resulted in a settlement of $300,000 from the other driver's insurance company for injuries Ellen incurred in the accident. The Kohatsus requested Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage 
benefits from their insurer, State Farm, for the remaining 
damages from the accident. The parties disputed the extent of injuries resulting from the accident and whether UIM benefits were owing, and thus the parties entered arbitration to resolve the issue of the Kohatsus' damages. In an Arbitration Award issued on December 10, 2010, a three-member arbitration panel awarded the Kohatsus a total of $2,304,652.12 in damages. 
Following the Arbitration Award, the parties disputed
 
the amount of insurance coverage that State Farm owed to the
 Kohatsus. In 2011, the Kohatsus initiated this action in the
 circuit court against State Farm and Nelson Fukuhara (Fukuhara),
 
who the Kohatsus allege was a State Farm agent who sold them the
 
subject State Farm automobile policies. The Kohatsus' First
 Amended Complaint asserts a number of claims against State Farm
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Fukuhara, and, inter alia, seeks a declaratory judgment that
 
State Farm owes $400,000 of stacked UIM benefits under four
 separate policies, for a total of $1.6 million in stacked UIM
 benefits.
 
In the circuit court, the Kohatsus and State Farm filed
 
cross motions for partial summary judgment addressing the extent
 of UIM coverage provided under the Kohatsus' State Farm insurance
 policy. In their amended partial summary judgment motion, the
 Kohatsus argued that each policy for their four vehicles provided
 stacked UIM coverage of $400,000, and thus, the four policies
 together provided stacked UIM coverage totaling $1.6 million. In
 the alternative, the Kohatsus argued that they should receive the
 entire amount of the arbitration award. To the contrary, State
 Farm argued that each policy for the Kohatsus' four vehicles
 provided $100,000 in UIM coverage and thus the four policies
 together provided stacked UIM coverage totaling $400,000. 
On January 8, 2014, the circuit court issued an order
 
granting State Farm's partial summary judgment motion, which
 stated in pertinent part:
 
3. The court finds that there are no genuine issues
of fact. The terms of the insurance policy in question are
not ambiguous. In construing the terms of the policy, the
court finds that the language of the policy does not allow
for a construction that would allow for stacking of the four
policies in question, then stacking the policies again.
4. In Macabio v. TIG Insurance Co., 87 Hawai' i 307,
955 P.2d 100 (1998), there was no stacking of underinsuredmotorist ("UIM") coverage. The issue was whether there was a sufficient offer of UIM coverage in accordance with theapplicable statute. In this case the [Kohatsus] opted forpaid for and obtained stacked UIM coverage for fourvehicles. Thus the discussion in Macabio as to the cost of stacked UIM coverage being less than the comparable level ofunstacked coverage does not apply to Plaintiffs [Kohatsus']effort in this case to stack again the already stackedpolicies. 
On May 8, 2014, the circuit court granted the Kohatsus'
 
motion for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b), determining that
 
there was no just reason for delaying entry of judgment on the
 UIM coverage issue. Thus, on May 8, 2014, the circuit court
 entered Judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b) in favor of State
 
3

Farm and against the Kohatsus on the UIM coverage issue. The
 
Kohatsus timely appealed.
II. Discussion
 
A. Standards of Review
 
We review a grant or denial of summary judgment 
de
 
novo. Guajardo v. AIG Hawai 'i Ins. Co., 118 Hawai 'i 196, 201, 187 
P.3d 580, 585 (2008) (citation omitted). With regard to
 
interpreting an insurance policy:
 
[I]nsurance policies are subject to the general rules of
contract construction; the terms of the policy should be
interpreted according to their plain, ordinary, and accepted
sense in common speech unless it appears from the policy
that a different meaning is intended. Moreover, every
insurance contract shall be construed according to the
entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the
policy.
 
Nevertheless, adherence to the plain language and literal
meaning of insurance contract provisions is not without
limitation. We have acknowledged that because insurance
policies are contracts of adhesion and are premised on
standard forms prepared by the insurer's attorneys, we have
long subscribed to the principle that they must be construed
liberally in favor of the insured and any ambiguities must
be resolved against the insurer. Put another way, the rule
is that policies are to be construed in accord with the
reasonable expectations of a layperson.
 
Id. at 202, 187 P.3d at 586 (block formation altered and citation
 
omitted).
 
A contract is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably
susceptible to more than one meaning. Airgo v. Horizon Cargo
 
Transp., 66 Haw. 590, 594, 670 P.2d 1277, 1280 (1983). As a
 
general rule, the court will look no further than the four
corners of the contract to determine whether an ambiguity
exists. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rentâ€“All, 90
Hawai'i 315, 324, 978 P.2d 753, 762 (1999) (noting that the
parties' disagreement as to the meaning of a contract does
not render it ambiguous). The parol evidence rule
"precludes the use of extrinsic evidence to vary or
contradict the terms of an unambiguous and integrated
contract." Pancakes of Hawai' i v. Pomare Props. Corp., 85
Hawai'i 300, 310, 944 P.2d 97, 107 (App.1997) (citation
omitted).
 
Hawaiian Ass'n of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Wong, 130 Hawai 'i 36, 
45, 305 P.3d 452, 461 (2013).
B. Stacking UIM Coverage
 
The Kohatsus contend that their automobile policy is
 
ambiguous because the "Limits of Liability" clause in the
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
document entitled "Your State Farm Car Policy" (Policy) does not
 
contain an explanation of stacked benefits. The Kohatsus further
 
argue that because State Farm issued separate policies for each
 vehicle insured, its offer of UIM coverage was ambiguous and
 reasonably susceptible to an interpretation in which the UIM
 coverage limit is stacked for four vehicles under each of the
 four policies, resulting in a total of $1.6 million in stacked
 UIM coverage in this case.
 
State Farm and the Kohatsus each attached the Policy to
 
their respective partial motions for summary judgment. Section
 III of the Policy addresses UIM coverage and according to the
 Policy, "W4" coverage is UIM coverage with the stacking option.
 The Policy contains a "Limits of Liability" clause, which the
 Kohatsus contend is insufficient because it does not contain an
 explanation of the limits for benefits available under the
 stacking option. The "Limits of Liability" section provides in
 pertinent part:
 
Limits of Liability - Coverage W4
 
1.	 The amount of coverage is shown on the declarations
page under "Limits of Liability - Coverage W4 - Each
Person, Each Accident". Under "Each Person" is the
 
amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily
 
injury to one person. "Bodily injury to one person"
 
includes all injury and damages to others resulting
from this bodily injury.  Under "Each Accident" is the
 
total amount of coverage, subject to the amount shown
under "Each Person", for all damages due to bodily
 injury to two or more persons in the same accident.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
The Kohatsus attached the Declarations Page for their
 
Mercury Tracer, the car that Ellen occupied during the accident,
 
which provides in pertinent part:
 
W4	 Underinsured Motor Vehicle (Stacking Option)
Limits of Liability-W4
Each Person, Each Accident
$100,000 $300,000
 
Thus, according to the Declarations Page for the Mercury Tracer,
 
the Kohatsus purchased the stacking option for UIM coverage with
 limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Kohatsus also attached to their amended partial
 
summary judgment motion the renewal policies for their other
 
three vehicles insured by State Farm. The renewal documents
 provide that the stacked UIM coverage for each vehicle, like the
 Mercury Tracer, was $100,000 per person and $300,000 per
 accident.
 
Both the Kohatsus and State Farm attached a document to
 
their respective motions for partial summary judgment entitled
 "Acknowledgment of Offer of Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist
 Coverage (Including Offer of Stacking Option) and Coverage
 Selection or Rejection" (UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer) for the
 
Mercury Tracer.
2 The form states: "I acknowledge and agree that
 
I have been offered Uninsured and Underinsured Motor Vehicle
 
Coverages, as described on the reverse side of this form, with
 limits equal to my Bodily Injury Liability Coverage Limit." The
 UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer gave the Kohatsus the options to
 reject UIM coverage or select a lower limit of coverage than that
 of their Bodily Injury Liability Coverage, which they did not opt
 for. The UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer also gave the Kohatsus
 the "Stacking" option for the UIM coverage, which they chose. 
Kelvin signed at the bottom of the front page of the UIM Coverage
 and Stacking Offer. On the reverse side, UIM coverage is defined
 as 
a separate and distinct coverage which protects you,
resident relatives and passengers in the insured vehicle
when death or bodily injury is caused by a motorist who has
inadequate insurance coverage. In other words, if you are
injured in an automobile accident and the motorist at fault
does not have enough Bodily Injury Liability Coverage to
cover your injuries, your Underinsured Motor Vehicle
coverage will take over and pay up to the limit selected,
depending upon your injuries.
 
In addition, the UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer provides the
 
following information about the option to stack UIM coverage:
 
2
 At oral argument, the parties confirmed that the UIM Coverage and
Stacking Offer used for the Mercury Tracer is identical to the offer form used
for the Kohatsus' other three cars.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Two coverage options are available (Non-Stacking and
Stacking). A description of how these options work and
examples are shown below. The same option (Non-Stacking or
Stacking) must be selected on both Uninsured and
Underinsured Motor Vehicle Coverages if you have both
coverages.
 
. . . . 
NON-STACKING AND STACKING EXAMPLES
 
The two coverage options that are available determine your
total limit for Uninsured and Underinsured Motor Vehicle
 Coverages.
 
Non-Stacking Coverage is the limits you carry on one
vehicle. This option costs less than the Stacking option.
 
Stacking Coverage is the total of the limits you carry on
all the vehicles you insure. If you add or delete vehicles,
the total limits will change. This option costs more than
the Non-Stacking option.
 
Example
 
You have one vehicle insured. The Uninsured/Underinsured
Motor Vehicle Coverage limit is $50,000/$100,000 for each
coverage. The total Uninsured/Underinsured Coverage
available for one accident is:
 
Non-Stacking  Stacking
Per Person Per Accident Per Person Per Accident
 Total Coverage $50,000/$100,000  $50,000/$100,000
Available  (Limit on One Vehicle) (Add Limits Together)
 
You have two vehicles insured. The Uninsured/Underinsured Motor
Vehicle Coverage limit is $50,000/$100,000 for each coverage. The
total Uninsured/Underinsured Coverage available for one accident
is:
 
Non-Stacking Stacking
Per Person Per Accident  Per Person Per Accident
 Total Coverage $50,000/$100,000  $100,000/$200,000
Available  (Limit on One Vehicle) (Add Limits Together)
 
In this case, the parties agree that the Kohatsus
 
insured four vehicles under four separate policies, and that they
 
elected the UIM stacking option for each offer of UIM coverage. 
According to the Declarations Page for the Mercury Tracer and the
 renewal documents for each of the three other cars, the Kohatsus'
 UIM coverage was $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident
 for each of their vehicles. According to the UIM Coverage and
 Stacking Offer: "
Stacking Coverage is the total of the limits you
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
carry on all the vehicles you insure. If you add or delete
 
vehicles, the total limits will change." (Emphasis added.) 
Further, with regard to non-stacking and stacking, the offer form
 stated that "[a] description of how these options work and
 examples are shown below." Important to our analysis is the
 example for when "[y]ou have two vehicles insured." Given the
 
established facts in this record, this example involves two
 
vehicles insured under two separate policies. In the example,
 where the UIM limit is $50,000/$100,000, the stacking option only
 results in doubled limits, i.e. $100,000/$200,000 of stacked UIM
 benefits. In other words, in accordance with the explanation in
 the offer that "Stacking Coverage is the total of the limits you
 carry on all the vehicles you insure[,]" the UIM limit is
 multiplied by two (the number of vehicles insured), rather than
 multiplying the UIM limit four times (twice for one policy and
 then twice for the other policy).
3
 
Based on a plain reading of the UIM Coverage and
 
Stacking Offer, including the specific example provided therein
 as to how stacking works, we conclude that the Kohatsus' stacked
 UIM coverage was the total of the UIM limits that they carried on
 the four vehicles they insured. Thus, the per person UIM
 coverage limit of $100,000 multiplied by four vehicles results in
 a total of $400,000 of stacked UIM coverage for the claim at
 issue.
 
C. Macabio v. TIG Insurance Co.
 
The Kohatsus contend that based on how State Farm
 
defines stacking â€“- to result in $400,000 rather than $1.6
 
million in stacked UIM coverage here -- the UIM Coverage and
 Stacking Offer is misleading when it states that stacking costs
 more and non-stacking costs less. The Kohatsus contend that
 
3
 The Kohatsus assert that their reading of the policy is reasonable
because it is possible that an insured who has multiple vehicles may choose to
stack UIM benefits only for some vehicles, but not all. We recognize the
potential issue that may arise in such a circumstance, but note that we are
not addressing such a circumstance in this case.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"[i]n fact, if four policies and their premiums are added
 
together as urged by State Farm, stacking costs less, not more,
 and non-stacking costs more, not less." The Kohatsus cite to
 Macabio v. TIG Ins. Co.
, 87 Hawai 'i 307, 955 P.2d 100 (1998) to 
support their contention that the UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer
 is misleading, and that given the misleading statement that
 stacking cost more, "it was reasonable for [the Kohatsus] to
 believe that benefits were also more for that policy, i.e.
 $400,000 per policy."
 
In Macabio, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i utilized a 
four prong test previously set forth in Mollena v. Fireman's Fund
 Ins. Co. of Hawaii, Inc., 72 Haw. 314, 816 P.2d 968 (1991), "to
 determine the legal sufficiency of an offer of insurance
 coverage" and concluded that the offer in Macabio was legally
 insufficient. Macabio, 87 Hawai
'i at 314, 955 P.2d at 107. The 
third prong of the test from Mollena is "the insurer must
 intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional
 coverage[.]" Id. (citation omitted). The supreme court stated
 
that the letter sent to the Macabios from their insurance carrier 
contains a provision explaining the nature of stacking by
comparing the [Uninsured Motorist (UM)] and UIM benefits of
a stacked policy with that of a non-stacked policy. The
example utilizes a two-car policy, each car with a
$75,000.00 limit of UIM coverage and a $75,000.00 limit of
UM coverage. From this example, it is clear that the stacked
policy would result in the insured being able to claim
benefits of $150,000.00, while the unstacked policy would
result in benefits of only $75,000.00.
 
Id. at 315, 955 P.2d at 108. The supreme court concluded:
 
Without further explanation, the average insured is not
likely to realize that he or she could purchase the same
amount of coverage under a stacked, two-car policy with
coverage of $25,000.00 on each vehicle, as an unstacked,
two-car policy with coverage of $50,000.00 on each vehicle,
but for a lower premium. For example, according to the chart
provided by TIG in its coverage selection form, an unstacked
two-car policy of UIM benefits, with a limit of $50,000.00
per vehicle, would result in a semi-annual premium of $26.00
(2 cars x $13.00). However, the same policy, with stacked
UIM benefits of $25,000.00 per vehicle would result in a
semi-annual premium of $24.00 (2 cars x $12.00). This
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
results in a semi-annual savings of $2.00, or an annual
savings of $4.00.
 
In this case, TIG sold the Macabios unstacked UIM coverage
with a limit of $100,000.00 per vehicle, at $19.00 per car
semi-annually. The Macabios had four cars and therefore paid
$76.00 (4 cars x $19.00). Because the coverage was
unstacked, the Macabios were protected to a maximum of
$100,000.00. The premium, however, for $25,000.00 of stacked
coverage was $12.00 per car for a total of $48.00 for four
cars. This would result in coverage equivalent to
$100,000.00 of unstacked coverage, but would have cost only
$48.00 semi-annuallyâ€”a savings of $28.00 ($76.00â€”$48.00).
Therefore, the Macabios could have obtained the same amount
of coverage at a lower premium by selecting the stacking
option.
 
Thus, the examples given in the offer clearly do not convey
the true "nature" of stacked coverage. Without more, an
insured with multiple vehicles is not likely to determine
that the same amount of coverage in an unstacked policy
could be purchased for a lower premium by selecting the
stacking option. Accordingly, the offer fails to satisfy the
third prong of the Mollena test.
 
Id. at 315-16, 955 P.3d at 108-09.
 
This case is distinguishable from Macabio. The
 
Macabios purchased non-stacked coverage, however, they could have
 
stacked their coverage to reach the same $100,000 limit per
 vehicle at a cheaper rate. By contrast, the Kohatsus in fact
 purchased stacked coverage, stacking each of their $100,000 UIM
 limits.
 
Moreover, the Kohatsus' argument about whether stacking
 
actually cost more in various scenarios does not impact the issue
 before us. Attached to their amended partial summary judgment
 motion, the Kohatsus provided a document entitled "Required and
 Optional Additional Coverage." The UIM coverage provided the
 following options:
 
Underinsured Motor Vehicle Coverage
(per person/per accident) Non-Stacking Stacking
Non-Stacking and Stacking Premium Premium
 
$ 20,000/40,000 (basic) $ 12.80 $ 20.40
 
$ 25,000/50,000 $ 15.00 $ 24.00
 
$ 35,000/100,000 $ 20.80 $ 34.20
 
$ 50,000/100,000 $ 24.00 $ 40.40
 
$ 100,000/300,000 $ 45.00 $ 74.20
 
With regard to the Kohatsus, State Farms' statement that stacked
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
UIM coverage costs more was correct, because the Kohatsus could
 
not have purchased a cheaper plan and received the desired
 limits, regardless of whether the stacked policies here are
 interpreted to provide $400,000 or $1.6 million of UIM coverage. 
Thus, in this case, State Farms' statements in the UIM Coverage
 and Stacking Offer that stacked coverage "costs more than the
 Non-Stacking option" and non-stacked coverage "costs less than
 the Stacking option" were not misleading as applied to the
 Kohatsus. See Ranger v. State Farm Ins. Co., 333 F. Supp.2d 935,
 
939-40 (D. Haw. 2004). The subject statements also appear to
 have no impact on the amount of stacked UIM coverage the Kohatsus
 would reasonably expect in this case.
 
Therefore, Macabio does not support the Kohatsus'
 
contention that the stacking offer was misleading and further
 does not support an interpretation that the Kohatsus are entitled
 to $1.6 million in stacked UIM coverage.
D. No Genuine Issues of Material Fact
 
The Kohatsus contend that the circuit court erred in
 
granting State Farm's partial summary judgment motion because
 
there were genuine issues of material fact. The Kohatsus contend
 Kelvin submitted a declaration setting forth representations made
 by their State Farm agent, Fukuhara, concerning the extent of
 benefits available under the policy and "State Farm submitted no
 counter declarations." Thus, the Kohatsus argue that a genuine
 issue of material fact "existed to preclude summary judgment
 because the circuit court could not resolve the merits of
 [Kelvin's] declaration by way of summary judgment."
 
Kelvin's declaration states in pertinent part that:
 
I was not familiar with and did not know what stacking was
so I asked my agent what we would get for the additional
premium charged for the stacking option. I was told that
 
the new policy limit would be increased to $100,000
multiplied by the number of cars I had.
 
(Emphasis added.) Kelvin then further asserts that his
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
understanding of his agent's statement was that there would be
 
UIM coverage of $400,000 for each policy, resulting in $1.6
 million for all four policies.
 
"[A] court must respect the plain terms of the policy 
and not create ambiguity where none exists." Hart v. Ticor Title 
Ins. Co., 126 Hawai
'i 448, 456, 272 P.3d 1215, 1223 (2012) 
(citation omitted). Further, "[i]t is well settled that courts should not draw inferences from a contract regarding the parties' intent when the contract is definite and unambiguous." State 
Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent-All, Inc., 90 Hawai
'i 315, 324, 
978 P.2d 753, 762 (1999). "The court should look no further than the four corners of the document to determine whether an ambiguity exists. Consequently, the parties' disagreement as to the meaning of a contract or its terms does not render clear language ambiguous." Id. (citations omitted). 
In this case, the explanation of UIM stacking in the 
UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer is not ambiguous. We decline to rely on evidence extrinsic to the four corners of the UIM Coverage and Stacking Offer to vary or contradict its terms. See 
Hawaiian Ass'n of Seventh-Day Adventists, 130 Hawai
'i at 45, 305 
P.3d at 461. Therefore, the circuit court did not err when it determined there were no genuine issues of material fact.
E. Arbitration Award
 
The Kohatsus contend, in the alternative, that the
 
plain language of the arbitration provision in the Policy
 
"provides that the amount of benefits awarded in arbitration is
 binding and that State Farm will pay any amount due."
 
With regard to deciding fault and amount under the W4
 
coverage carried by the Kohatsus, the Policy states in pertinent
 part:
 
Deciding Fault and Amount â€” Coverages U, U4, W and W4
 
Two questions must be decided by agreement between the
insured and us:
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1.	 Is the insured legally entitled to collect
damages from the owner or driver of the uninsured
 
motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle; and
 
2. 	 If so, in what amount?
 
If there is no agreement, these questions shall be decided
by arbitration upon written request of the insured or us.
 
The next provision in the Policy states:
 
Payment of Any Amount Due - Coverages U, U4, W and W4
 
We will pay any amount due:
 
1.	 to the insured;
 2.	 to a parent or guardian if the insured is
 
minor or an incompetent person;
 
3.	 to the surviving spouse; or
 4.	 at our option, to a person authorized by law to
receive such payment.
 
The Kohatsus rely on the above two provisions to assert
 
that State Farm was required to pay the entire amount of the
 
arbitration award. However, the provision entitled "Limits of
 Liability - Coverage W4" sets forth a limit on the amount of UIM
 benefits that State Farm will pay:
 
2.	 The most we pay will be the lesser of:
 
a.	 the difference between the amount of the
 
insured's damages for bodily injury and the
 
amount paid to the insured by or for any person
 
or organization who is or may be held legally
liable for the bodily injury; or
 
b.	 the limits of liability of this coverage
.
 
(Emphasis added.) In reading the provisions of the Policy
 
together, the Limits of Liability section reflects that the
 payment of "any amount due" will at most amount to "the limits of
 liability of this coverage." Based on our discussion above, the
 Kohatsus' stacked UIM coverage amounted to $400,000 per person.
 
Therefore, the Kohatsus' policy does not provide that
 
State Farm was required to pay the entire amount of damages
 awarded in the Arbitration Award.

III. Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth above, the "Judgment
