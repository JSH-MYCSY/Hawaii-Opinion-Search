NO. CAAP-14-0000875
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
IN RE MARN FAMILY LITIGATION
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NOS. 98-5371-12; 98-4706-10)

 
ORDER GRANTING THE JUNE 16, 2014 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Receiver Pendente Lite/Appellee
 
Ronald K. Kotoshirodo's (Receiver Kotoshirodo) June 16, 2014
 
motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000875 for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) the lack of any memorandum by
 Defendant-Appellant Alexander Y. Marn (Appellant Alexander Marn)
 in response to Receiver Kotoshirodo's June 16, 2014 motion to
 dismiss, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over Appellant Alexander Marn's appeal from the
 Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's May 7, 2014 post-judgment "Order
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Granting Receiver's Motion to Authorize Marketing of 608 N. Judd 
Street Property and to Approve Retention of Real Estate Broker and Proposed Listing Agreement, Filed on March 11, 2014" (the May 7, 2014 post-judgment order), because the May 7, 2014 post-judgment order is not an appealable final post-judgment order pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), 
and the holding in Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai 'i 153, 157, 80 
P.3d 974, 978 (2003). 
Several years ago, the circuit court entered an
 
October 25, 2010 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment that imposed
 awards of money damages, various fees and costs against, among
 other parties, Appellant Alexander Marn and Defendant-Appellee
 Eric Y. Marn (Appellee Eric Marn). Appellant Alexander Marn and
 Appellee Eric Marn are the sole partners of Pumehana Associates,
 which, in turn, owns assets that include the 608 N. Judd Street
 Property. The court-appointed receiver for the judgment
 creditor, McCully Associates, Receiver-Appellee Thomas E. Hayes
 (Receiver Hayes), initiated the instant post-judgment proceeding
 for the purpose of satisfying the October 25, 2010 HRCP
 Rule 54(b)-certified judgment against Appellant Alexander Marn's
 and Appellee Eric Marn's interests in Pumehana Associates by
 having filed a June 20, 2011 post-judgment motion for entry of
 charging orders that would authorize Receiver Hayes to use
 Appellant Alexander Marn's and Appellee Eric Marn's interests in
 Pumehana Associates to satisfy the October 25, 2010 HRCP
 Rule 54(b)-certified judgment. On August 18, 2011, the circuit
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court granted Receiver Hayes's June 20, 2011 post-judgment 
motion, and entered two corresponding August 18, 2011 post-judgment charging orders against Appellant Alexander Marn's and Appellee Eric Marn's interests in Pumehana Associates. On February 13, 2012, the circuit court appointed Receiver Kotoshirodo as the receiver for Pumehana Associates, but the post-judgment proceeding has not yet concluded. The subject order of Appellant Alexander Marn's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000875, i.e., the May 7, 2014 post-judgment order (which authorizes the marketing of Pumehana Associates' 608 N. Judd Street Property and approves retention of a real estate
 broker and a proposed listing agreement) does not conclude or
 finally determine Receiver Hayes's post-judgment proceeding for
 executing the October 25, 2010 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment
 against Appellant Alexander Marn's and Appellee Eric Marn's
 interests in Pumehana Associates.
 
A "post-judgment order is an appealable final order 
under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order end[ed] the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 
103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
"Correlatively, a[ post-judgment] order is not final [and appealable] if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Id. at 157, 80 
P.3d at 978 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i held that an order denying 
a post-judgment motion to quash a garnishee summons is not an appealable post-judgment order because such an order does not end 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and finally determine that particular post-judgment garnishment 
proceeding: 
In this case, the circuit court's denial of
Garnishees' motion to quash the garnishee summons is not a
final order, but simply an interlocutory step in the
garnishment process. It did not terminate the garnishment
proceedings. Nor did it finally adjudicate the rights of
any party. To the contrary, the order perpetuated the
proceedings. It determined that the summons was properly
issued which enabled the proceedings to continue.
Consequently, the order left pending several issues
regarding the ultimate fate of the preserved funds. Further
 proceedings are needed to determine whether Garnishees have
a right to setoff; whether there are conflicting claims to
the funds; and whether the funds may be applied to satisfy
the underlying judgment. These determinations were to be
 made at the garnishee proof hearing which was scheduled, but
never heard.
 

This appeal is premature and we dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction. 
  
Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Central Pacific Boiler & Piping,
 
Ltd.
, 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 938 (1986) (footnote
 
omitted).
 
In the instant case, the May 7, 2014 post-judgment
 
order does not finally determine and end the post-judgment
 proceeding for executing the October 25, 2010 HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment against Appellant Alexander Marn's and
 Appellee Eric Marn's interests in Pumehana Associates. Instead,
 the May 7, 2014 post-judgment motion is simply an interlocutory
 post-judgment order in a series of post-judgment orders directed
 at resolving Receiver Hayes's post-judgment proceeding for
 executing the October 25, 2010 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment
 against Appellant Alexander Marn's and Appellee Eric Marn's
 interests in Pumehana Associates. The May 7, 2014 post-judgment
 order will not become eligible for appellate review until an
 aggrieved party asserts a timely appeal from a subsequent post-
judgment order that finally determines and ends this post­
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment proceeding for executing the October 25, 2010 HRCP 
Rule 54(b)-certified judgment against Appellant Alexander Marn's and Appellee Eric Marn's interests in Pumehana Associates. 
Absent a post-judgment order that finally determines
 
and ends the post-judgment proceeding for executing the
 October 25, 2010 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment against
 Appellant Alexander Marn's and Appellee Eric Marn's interests in
 Pumehana Associates, leaving nothing further to be accomplished
 in that particular post-judgment proceeding, Appellant Alexander
 Marn's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction
 over appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000875. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Receiver Kotoshirodo's
 
June 16, 2014 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP­14-0000875 for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and
 appellate court case number CAAP-14-0000875 is dismissed for lack
 of appellate jurisdiction.
