STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
EVELINE P. SEIDL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-03123)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Eveline P. Seidl (Seidl) appeals
 
from the "Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment" entered on May 20, 2014 in the District Court of

 
1
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division  (district court). Seidl
 
was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 
intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) (Supp. 2015).2

 HRS § 291E-61 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of
an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if
the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a
vehicle:
 
(1) 	While under the influence of alcohol in an
 amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;

On appeal, Seidl argues that the district court erred
 
by
 
(1) incorporating pretrial motions into the trial over
 
her objection;
 
(2) hearing pretrial motions on the same day as trial;
 
(3)depriving her of the right to obtain transcripts of
 
the pretrial motions' hearing;
 
(4) denying her motion to suppress on Fourth Amendment
 
grounds;
 
(5) denying her motion to dismiss for violating her
 
statutory and constitutional right to counsel;
 
(6) denying her motion to dismiss for failure to define
 
the term "alcohol" in the charge;
 
(7) failing to find a violation of Brady v. Maryland, 
373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963) or Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 16 when Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) demanded 
payment to inspect discovery; 
(8) admitting into evidence sworn statements of the
 
intoxilyzer supervisor over her objection; and
 
(9) taking judicial notice, over Seidl's objection, of
 
the approval of the Intoxilyzer device, the accuracy verification
 process, and the internal standards accuracy verification device. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Seidl's
 points of error as follows:
 
(1) Seidl argues that the district court erred when it
 
incorporated testimony from her pretrial motions to suppress into
 the trial on the merits over her objection. The State concedes

that this was reversible error under State v. Thomas, 72 Haw. 48,
 
805 P.2d 1212 (1991).
 
HRPP Rule 12(e) states, "A motion made before trial 
shall be determined before trial unless the court orders that it be deferred for determination at the trial of the general issue or until after verdict; provided that a motion to suppress made before trial shall be determined before trial." (Emphasis added). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that the trial 
court's "failure to decide a motion to suppress prior to trial constitutes reversible error." Thomas, 72 Haw. at 53, 805 P.2d 
at 1214 (citing State v. Rodgers, 70 Haw. 156, 157, 766 P.2d 675, 676 (1988)). "The only occasion where a court need not decide a motion to suppress prior to trial is where the parties agree to consolidate the hearing on the motion with trial pursuant to our holding in State v. Doyle, 64 Haw. 229, 638 P.2d 332 (1981)." Thomas, 72 Haw. at 53, 805 P.2d at 1214. 
The supreme court in Doyle
 stated: 
[W]here the trial court at a bench trial expressly advises
the parties, for the record, of its intention to hear the
motion and the merits contemporaneously and no objection is
voiced by either party to the proposed procedure, the trial
court may then proceed to hear the issues contemporaneously.
The trial court should, however, enter its ruling on the
motion to suppress before finally determining the merits of
the charge against the defendant.
 
Doyle, 64 Haw. at 231, 638 P.2d at 334 (footnote omitted). The
 
exception articulated in Doyle "requires an express statement and
 agreement by the parties, on the record, where the court intends
 to hear testimony on the motion and merits contemporaneously." 
Thomas, 72 Haw. at 54, 805 P.2d at 1214. 
It is undisputed that Seidl objected to the district
 
court's incorporation of her pretrial motion testimony into her
 trial on the merits. The district court's decision to
 incorporate the motion testimony over Seidl's objection did not
 conform with HRPP Rule 12(e) or the requirements set forth in
 Doyle and Thomas. Therefore, the district court's failure to
 determine Seidl's motions to suppress prior to her trial on the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
merits constituted reversible error.3 See Thomas, 72 Haw. at 54,
 
805 P.2d at 1214.
 
(2) Seidl argues that the district court violated HRPP
 
Rule 12(e) when it heard the pretrial motion on the same day as
 
Seidl's trial. The plain language of HRPP Rule 12(e) only
 requires that a pretrial motion be determined prior to trial, it
 does not require that pretrial motions be determined on a
 different day than the trial. See State v. Rollison, No. CAAP­
14-0000765 at *1 (App. Nov. 25, 2015) (SDO); see also Thomas, 72
 Haw. at 54, 805 P.2d at 1214 (stating that a hearing that
 occurred immediately prior to the start of trial arguably
 complied with HRPP Rule 12(e)). Therefore, Seidl's argument is
 without merit. See Rollison, SDO at *1.
 
(3) Seidl argues that the district court erred when it 
denied her motion to suppress on Fourth Amendment grounds. Specifically, Seidl argues that, contrary to the Implied Consent Form, her consent to the breath test was not voluntary because if she refused the test she would be charged with civil and criminal penalties. In State v. Yon Shik Won (Won II), 137 Hawai
'i 330, 
349, 372 P.3d 1065, 1084 (2015), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held 
that "coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a free and unconstrained choice[.]" See article I, section 7 of the Hawai
'i Constitution 
("The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches, seizures and invasions of privacy shall not be violated[.]"). Consequently, a defendant's decision to submit to testing after being read the Implied Consent Form "is invalid as a waiver of his [or her] right not to be searched." Won II, 137 Hawai
'i at 349, 372 P.3d 
at 1084. In accordance with the supreme court's decision in Won II, the result of Seidl's breath test was the product of a warrantless search and, therefore, the district court erred by

 Given our holding, we need not address Seidl's argument that she
was also prevented from obtaining transcripts of the motion testimony.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denying Seidl's motion to suppress the result of her breath
 
test.4 See id. at 355, 372 P.3d at 1090.
 
(4) Seidl argues that the district court erred by
 
denying her motion to dismiss the State's complaint because the
 complaint failed to define the term "alcohol," which Seidl argues
 is an essential element of an OVUII offense. Seidl argues that,
 without alleging the statutory definition of "alcohol," the
 State's complaint deprived her of fair notice of the charge
 against her.
 
At the time the State filed its complaint against
 
Seidl, the term "alcohol" was defined as 
the product of distillation of any fermented liquid,
regardless of whether rectified, whatever may be the origin
thereof, and includes ethyl alcohol, lower aliphatic
alcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl alcohol, but
not denatured or other alcohol that is considered not
 potable under the customs laws of the United States.
 
HRS § 291E-1 (2007 Repl.) (emphasis added). 
Reviewing a nearly identical argument to the one that 
Seidl raises, this court has previously held that "the statutory 
exception for denatured or other non-potable alcohol is a 'defense' to the OVUII offense, and is not an 'element' of the offense that is required to be alleged in an OVUII charge." State v. Turping, 136 Hawai
'i 333, 336, 361 P.3d 1236, 1239 (App. 
2015). The court in Turping held that the State's OVUII charge, which did not include the statutory definition of "alcohol," was sufficient. Id. at 337-38, 361 P.3d at 1240-41. Similarly in 
the case before us, the State's OVUII complaint was sufficient and, therefore, the district court did not err in denying Seidl's motion to dismiss. See id. 
(5) Seidl argues that the district court erred by
 
denying Seidl's motion to dismiss for alleged Brady violations.
 Specifically, Seidl contends the State committed a Brady
 
4
 Because we hold that the results of Seidl's breath test should be
 
suppressed, we need not address her arguments that the district court erred in
admitting the "sworn statements of the intoxilyzer supervisors," erred in
taking "judicial notice of the approval of the Intoxilyzer device, the
approval of an accuracy verification process, and the approval of the internal
standards accuracy verification device," and erred in denying her motion to
suppress based on an alleged right to counsel.

violation when it demanded payment as a condition to inspect
 
certain requested materials.
 
In [Brady, 373 U.S. at 87,] the United States Supreme Court
held that suppression by the prosecution of evidencefavorable to the accused violates due process where theevidence is material to guilt or punishment, regardless ofthe good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. The Bradyrule has been incorporated into the Hawaii due processjurisprudence and relied upon frequently by [the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court]. 
State v. Matafeo, 71 Haw. 183, 185-86, 787 P.2d 671, 672 (1990)
 
(internal citations omitted). 
Seidl also argues that the State had a duty to disclose
 
material under HRRP Rule 16, which governs disclosures in
 criminal cases. See State ex rel. Marsland v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304,
 
309, 788 P.2d 1281, 1284 (1990). HRPP Rule 16(a) limits
 discovery "to cases in which the defendant is charged with a
 felony," except as provided in HRPP Rule 16(d), which provides:
 
Rule 16. DISCOVERY.
 
. . . .
 
(d)
 Discretionary disclosure. Upon a showing of
materiality and if the request is reasonable, the court in
its discretion may require disclosure as provided for in
this Rule 16 in cases other than those in which the
 defendant is charged with a felony, but not in cases
involving violations.
 
This court has previously held that "[w]hile it may be
 
permissible for the State to charge a defendant for copying costs
 
where the defendant requests copies of materials subject to
 disclosure, the State cannot condition the disclosure of Brady
 material or discovery on the payment for copies that the
 defendant only seeks to view." See State v. Yoshimoto, No. CAAP­
14-0000896 at *2 (App. Jan. 29, 2016) (SDO); Rollison, SDO at *2. 
"If discovery is required, the State cannot preclude a defendant
 from inspecting discovery materials on the ground that the
 defendant refuses to pay a fee." State v. Woods, CAAP-14-0001278
 
at *1 (App. June 2, 2016) (SDO) (emphasis omitted). Therefore,
 the district court erred to the extent that it found no Brady
 violation or HRPP Rule 16 violation because Seidl refused to pay
 for copying costs. See Woods, SDO at *1; Yoshimoto, SDO at *2;
 
Rollison, SDO at *2.

We note that the record does not indicate what
 
contested materials Seidl sought to access and, therefore, this
 
court has no basis on which to determine whether the withheld
 material qualified as Brady material or material subject to
 disclosure under HRPP Rule 16. On remand, the district court
 should determine whether Seidl is entitled to disclosure of the
 subject material under 
Brady and the extent to which Seidl is
 
also entitled to discovery under HRPP Rule 16(d). See Yoshimoto,
 
SDO at *2; Rollison, SDO at *2.
 
Therefore,

 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment" entered on May 20, 2014
 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division is
 vacated and this case is remanded for a new trial consistent with
 this disposition.
