NO. CAAP-14-0000886
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
TARA MARIE HALL, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES HAROLD HALL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 13-1-6851)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant James Harold
 
Hall's (Appellant James Hall) appeal from the Honorable Gale L.F.
 Ching's May 13, 2014 interlocutory "Order Re: Motion and
 Declaration for Pre-Decree Relief, Filed December 23, 2013 and
 Motion and Declaration for Pre-Decree Relief, Filed January 17,
 2014" (the May 13, 2014 interlocutory order) because the May 13,
 2014 interlocutory order does not qualify as an independently
 appealable final order or decree pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006), under which "[a]n interested
 party aggrieved by any order or decree of the court may appeal to
 the intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in
 
the circuit court [.]" (Emphasis added). In circuit court cases,
 
aggrieved parties may appeal from "final judgments, orders or
 decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013). Under Hawai
'i 
case law, a family court divorce case is eligible for appellate
 review under HRS § 571-54 only after the family court enters a
 final judgment, order or decree that dissolves the parties'
 marriage:
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
 (4) division and distribution of property and debts. 
Black
 
v. Black, 6 Haw. App. [493], 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In
 Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided. Although we recommend that,
except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we
conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is
final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3),
and (4) remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.
 
Eaton v. Eaton , 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987)
 
(footnote omitted). The May 13, 2014 interlocutory order is not
 
independently appealable under HRS § 571-54 and the holding in
 Eaton v. Eaton because the family court has not yet dissolved the
 marriage between Appellant James Hall and Plaintiff-Appellee Tara
 Marie Hall.
 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist
 
under the doctrine in 
Forgay v. Conrad,  47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the
 
Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), the May 13, 2014 interlocutory order
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the 
Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641­1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 
704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent an appealable final judgment, order or decree,
 
we lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal, and Appellant
 James Hall's appeal is premature. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000886 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
