(4) denying his "Non-Hearing Motion for Findings of
 
Fact and Conclusions of Law" (Motion for FOF/COL) for purposes of
 
this appeal.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Gee, as a landlord, entered into a rental agreement
 
with tenants, Defendants-Appellees Richard Loo, Sherrie Lynn Loo,
 
and Wallace D. Loo (Wallace) (collectively, Appellees), on
 
February 20, 2009. On December 22, 2011, the condominium
 
association, Association of Apartment Owners of Kaimana Lanais
 (AOAO), sent a demand letter to Gee to evict his tenants based on
 
violations of AOAO rules. In January 2012, Appellees signed a
 
letter acknowledging that they would vacate the rental unit by
 February 23, 2012, but did not do so.
 
Gee filed a complaint against Appellees in the district
 
court on April 12, 2012. Appellees vacated the rental unit on
 May 3, 2012. On or around May 23, 2012, Gee sent Wallace a
 letter outlining charges to be passed on to Appellees and
 deductions from their security deposit.
 
On May 20, 2013, Gee filed a "Non-Hearing Motion for
 
Default Judgment" (Motion for Default Judgment) The district
 
court granted in part a renewed version of the motion on May 8,
 
2014. The district court received Gee's Motion for FOF/COL on
 May 12, 2014 and filed the denial of the motion on June 5, 2014.
 The district court entered the Judgment on May 15, 2014.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL)
 
A trial court's findings of fact (FOF) are reviewed 
under the clearly erroneous standard. Leslie v. Estate of 
Tavares, 91 Hawai
'i 394, 399, 984 P.2d 1220, 1225 (1999). "An 
FOF is also clearly erroneous when the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding. [The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has] 
defined 'substantial evidence' as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. (quoting State 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
v. Kotis, 91 Hawai 'i 319, 328, 984 P.2d 78, 87 (1999)) (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 
"A trial court's conclusions of law [(COL)] are 
reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard of review." In 
re Estate of Kam, 110 Hawai 'i 8, 18, 129 P.3d 511, 521 (2006) 
(quoting Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Roe, 96 Hawai 'i 1, 
11, 25 P.3d 60, 70 (2001) (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
"However, a COL that presents mixed questions of fact 
and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case." Chun v. Bd. of Trustees 
of Employees' Ret. Sys. Of State of Hawai
'i, 106 Hawai 'i 416, 430, 
106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. V. Ponce, 105 Hawai
'i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004) (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted).
B. Pre-Judgment Interest Awards
 
"An award of prejudgment interest is reviewed for abuse 
of discretion." Tri-S Corp. V. Western World Ins. Co., 110 
Hawai'i 473, 489, 135 P.3d 82, 98 (2006) (citing Amfac, Inc. V. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 137, 839 P.2d 10, 36 
(1992)). An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, 74 Haw. at 114, 839 P.2d at 26. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Breach of Contract Award
 
Gee argues that the district court's reduction of the 
principal amount claimed from $8,026.12 to $5,115.26
2 was 
reversible error and was based on an inadequate explanation. As a mixed question of fact and law, this court reviews whether the reduction was clearly erroneous. Leslie, 91 Hawai
'i at 399, 984 
P.2d at 1225. 
2
 Gee misstates the reduction as $5,515.26 instead of $5,115.26.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In his memorandum in support of the Motion for Default
 
Judgment, Gee stated the Appellees owed $4,315.97 in back rent,
 
hold over tenancy rent, and late fees. An additional amount of
 $3,095.26 was for the AOAO's attorney's fees, which Gee requested
 in the principal award. Gee also requested his own attorney's
 fees, in the amount of $1,164.89, which he considered "the cost
 of additional rent." Gee subtracted a $550 credit from
 Appellee's security deposit to arrive at the total requested
 amount of $8,026.12.
 
The district court gave no explanation for its 
reduction other than its conclusion, "Damages not awarded were due to insufficiency of proof." 
Based on Gee's proffered 
evidence, it is unclear how the district court arrived at its reduced award of $5,115.26.  The district court's reduction was 
clearly erroneous. Leslie, 91 Hawai
'i at 399, 984 P.2d at 1225. 
B. Security Deposit Deduction
 
Gee argues that the district court's denial of his
 
requested deductions from the security deposit was reversible
 error because the district court's explanation was inadequate.
 
The district court entered a line-item subtraction from
 
the total default judgment award in the amount of $1,400 for
 "security deposit." The district court gave no explanation for
 this amount other than its summary conclusion "Damages not
 awarded were due to insufficiency of proof."
 
In his Motion for Default Judgment, Gee listed a number
 
of deductions from the security deposit that totaled $850. In
 his declaration, Gee listed the deductions: "i. $400.00 for one
 half rug replacement costs; ii. $150.00 to purchase and install
 vanity mirror; iii. $150.00 to purchase and replace toilet; iv.
 $50.00 to clean jalousie and oven; and v. $100.00 to repair holes
 in walls." Attached as Exhibit 11 to Gee's declaration, Gee
 provided a more detailed explanation for the deductions in a note
 he sent to Wallace on or around May 23, 2013: 
5/16/12 	Estimated Carpet Replacement 
$800.00 x .5 $400.00
 
5/16/12 
	Vanity Mirror (54" x 33") and 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
installation $150.00 
5/16/12 Toilet tank cover (possible toilet
replace. [sic] to match) $150.00 
5/16/12 Jalousies, clean oven and toilet $50.00 
5/16/12 Damage to walls (match texture toblend in) $100.00 
Gee failed to provide sufficient evidence of the costs 
underlying the deductions for the security deposit. Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 521-44(c) (2006 Repl.) requires Gee to 
provide "written evidence of the costs of remedying tenant 
defaults, such as estimates or invoices for material and services or the costs of cleaning, such as receipts for supplies and equipment or charges for cleaning services." Gee provided merely a list of deductions, which appear to be his own estimates of the costs of repair, replacement, or cleaning. The district court's finding against the security deposit deductions was therefore not clearly erroneous. Leslie, 91 Hawai
'i at 399, 984 P.2d at 1225. 
C. Pre-Judgment Interest Award
 
Gee argues that the district court should have awarded
 
prejudgment interest accruing from June 3, 2012, thirty days
 after the date that Appellees surrendered possession of the
 apartment.
 
An award of prejudgment interest is authorized under
 
HRS section 636-16 (1993).
3 "The purpose of [HRS ยง 636-16] is to
 
allow the court to designate the commencement date of interest in
 order to correct injustice when a judgment is delayed for a long
 period of time for any reason, including litigation delays." 
Amfac, 75 Haw. at 136, 839 P.2d at 36 (citations, internal
 quotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets omitted). A finding of
 
3
 HRS ยง 636-16 states,
 
ยง636-16 Awarding interest. In awarding interest
in civil cases, the judge is authorized to designate
the commencement date to conform with the
 circumstances of each case, provided that the earliest
commencement date in cases arising in tort, may be the
date when the injury first occurred and in cases
arising by breach of contract, it may be the date when
the breach first occurred.

fault is not a precursor to an award of prejudgment interest, and 
"where no fault is found on either side, the trial court may still award or deny prejudgment interest in its discretion, depending on the circumstances of the case." Tri-S Corp., 110 
Hawai
'i at 498, 135 P.3d at 107; see Page v. Domino's Pizza, 
Inc., 80 Hawai 'i 204, 209, 908 P.2d 552, 557 (App. 1995) 
(upholding a denial of prejudgment interest where the trial court found that the period of time it took to complete the case was not extraordinary considering "the totality of the case."). 
Gee made no showing in his Motion for Default Judgment
 
that there were substantial delays in the judgment such that an
 award for prejudgment interest would correct an injustice. Gee
 instead cited Appellee's failure to vacate the premises on the
 agreed upon date, Appellee's uncooperativeness, and Appellee's
 failure to pay rent. Gee's arguments on appeal of substantial
 delay were not made to the district court. As such, it cannot be
 said that the district court "clearly exceeded the bounds of
 reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to
 the substantial detriment of a party litigant" in not awarding
 prejudgment interest. Amfac, 74 Haw. at 114, 839 P.2d at 26.
 
D. Request for "FOF/COL"
 
Gee argues that the district court's explanation for
 
its denial of his Motion for FOF/COL was inadequate. In denying
 Gee's motion, the district court wrote, "Court ruled on non-
hearing motion per [District Court Rules of Civil Procedure
 [(DCRCP)] 52(a), FOF/COL are unnecessary on decisions of motions. 
Damages not awarded were due to insufficiency of proof."
 
DCRCP Rule 52 provides in relevant part:
 
RULE 52. FINDINGS BY THE COURT
 
(a) Effect. In all actions tried upon the
facts, the court upon request of any party shall find
the facts specially and state separately its
conclusions of law thereon. Judgment shall be entered
pursuant to Rule 58. Unless findings are requested,
the court shall not be required to make findings of
fact and conclusions of law. If an opinion or
memorandum of decision is filed, stating the facts and
the court's opinion on the law, it will be unnecessary
to make other findings of fact and conclusions of law.
Findings of fact and conclusions of law are
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
unnecessary on decisions of motions except as provided
in Rule 41(b).
 
. . . .
 
(c) When judgment is appealed. Whenever a
 
notice of appeal is filed and findings of fact and
conclusions of law have not been made, unless such
findings and conclusions are unnecessary as provided
by subdivision (a) of this rule, the court shall find
the facts specially and state separately its
conclusions of law thereon.
 
(Emphases added.) Gee's argument rests on DCRCP Rule 52(c)
 
because he filed a notice of appeal. However, subsection (c)
 provides an exception to the requirement that district courts
 provide FOF/COL where deemed unnecessary in subsection (a). 
Under subsection (a), FOF/COL are unnecessary on decisions of
 motions. Here, Gee had submitted a non-hearing Motion for
 Default Judgment on May 8, 2014, upon which the district court's
 judgment was based. Therefore, the district court was not
 required to make FOF/COL under DCRCP Rule 52.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Judgment entered on May 15, 2014 in the District
 
Court of the First Circuit is vacated and this case is remanded
 for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
