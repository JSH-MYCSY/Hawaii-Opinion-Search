NO. CAAP-14-0000893
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JERALD BALGUNA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 11-1-0489)
 
ORDER
 
(1) GRANTING MOTION FOR DISMISSAL OF APPEAL;
(2) DENIED AS MOOT THE NOVEMBER 14, 2014 RESPONSE TO
OCTOBER 30, 2014 ORDER OF COURT; AND
(3) ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the November 11, 2014 "Stipulated
 
Motion for Dismissal of Appeal," which the court construes as a
 
motion to dismiss the appeal, and the November 14, 2014 "Response
 to October 30, 2014 Order of Court," which the court construes as
 a motion for extension of time to file the opening brief should
 the court deny the motion to dismiss the appeal, both filed by
 Defendant-Appellant Jerald Balguna (
Appellant), through counsel
 
Lars Robert Isaacson (Counsel), the papers in support, and the
 
record, it appears that:
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) On September 26, 2014, Appellant, through Counsel,
 
filed a motion for extension of time to file the opening brief,
 
from September 26 to October 27, 2014. Appellant failed to
 explain why the extension was needed. 
(2) On October 1, 2014, this court granted the 
September 26, 2014 extension request, cautioning Counsel to explain in extension requests why extensions are needed, in compliance with Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
26(b). 
(3) On October 27, 2014, Appellant filed a second
 
motion for extension of time to file the opening brief without
 any justification for the extension by Counsel.
 
(4) On October 30, 2014, this court denied the
 
October 27, 2014 extension request, without prejudice to
 Appellant filing within three days of the order an opening brief
 or a motion for extension of time that complied with HRAP Rules
 26(b) and 29(b) and showed good cause for the extension. 
(5) Thereafter, Appellant failed to file an opening
 
brief or extension request, explaining in the declaration
 accompanying the instant motion that he did so because he was
 waiting until resentencing on November 10, 2014, to see if the
 Circuit Court would reinstate Appellant's deferral status and,
 thus, render the appeal moot. 
(6) Appellant moves to dismiss the appeal. In the
 
alternative, he moves for an extension of time to file the
 opening brief. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
 (1) The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted, and
 
the appeal in No. CAAP-14-0000893 is dismissed.
 
(2) The November 14, 2014 "Response to October 30, 2014
 
Order of Court" is denied as moot.
 
(3) Lars Robert Isaacson is ordered within five days to
 
show cause (if any, beyond that already stated in Counsel's
 declaration in support of the instant motion) for his failure to
 comply with the October 30, 2014 order to file within three days
 of the order an opening brief or a motion for extension of time

that complies with HRAP Rules 26(b) and 29(b). Failure to comply 
with this order or show good cause may result in sanctions.
