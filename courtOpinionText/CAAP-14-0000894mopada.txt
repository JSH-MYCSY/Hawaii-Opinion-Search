IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STEVE S. CHUNG, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 12-1-1482)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Steve S. Chung (Chung) appeals from
 
the "Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence," entered on
 
1
June 3, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit
 
court).
 
On appeal, Chung contends the circuit court erred in
 
convicting him of unauthorized control of propelled vehicle
 
(UCPV), under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-836 (2014
 
2
Repl.),  because: 
1 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided. 
2
 § 708-836 Unauthorized control of propelled
vehicle. (1) A person commits the offense of
unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle if the
person intentionally or knowingly exerts unauthorized
control over another's propelled vehicle by operating
the vehicle without the owner's consent or by changing
the identity of the vehicle without the owner's
consent.
 
(2) "Propelled vehicle" means an automobile,
airplane, motorcycle, motorboat, or other
motor-propelled vehicle.

(1) the circuit court's jury instructions were
 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, and
 
misleading, thus violating Chung's constitutional rights to due
 process and fair trial; and
 
(2) the jury was irreparably tainted by a juror's
 
opinion that Chung had a "huge creep factor," thus violating
 Chung's constitutional rights to due process and fair trial by an
 impartial jury.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On October 4, 2012, Sergeant Albert Lee (Sergeant Lee)
 
of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) pulled Chung over at a
 
red light at an intersection on Kanunu Street. Chung was driving
 
a yellow moped with a yellow paper inserted into the ignition
 instead of a key. Sergeant Lee testified that he explained to
 Chung that he wanted to check if the moped was stolen and that
 Chung told him that he had a key and that the moped was not
 stolen. Through his computer system, Sergeant Lee entered the
 emblem number, obtained the serial number, and learned that the
 moped had been reported stolen. The registered owner was listed
 as George Calventas (Calventas). Sergeant Lee then telephoned
 
Calventas who confirmed the moped was still stolen and that he
 
2(...continued)
(3) It is an affirmative defense to a
prosecution under this section that the defendant:
 
(a)	 Received authorization to use the vehicle
 
from an agent of the owner where the agent
had actual or apparent authority to
authorize such use; or
 
(b)	 Is a lien holder or legal owner of the
propelled vehicle, or an authorized agent
of the lien holder or legal owner, engaged
in the lawful repossession of the
propelled vehicle.
 
(4) For the purposes of this section, "owner"
means the registered owner of the propelled vehicle or
the unrecorded owner of the vehicle pending transfer
of ownership; provided that if there is no registered
owner of the propelled vehicle or unrecorded owner of
the vehicle pending transfer of ownership, "owner"
means the legal owner.
 
(5) Unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle
is a class C felony.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3did not know Chung.  Chung was placed under arrest.
Upon further observation of the moped, Sergeant Lee
testified that he noticed "[t]he ignition, where the ignition was
supposed to be, was missing, it was just a hole over there, the
trunk lock was punched, and the -- the yellow paper was inside
the ignition hole, covering it."  Sergeant Lee testified that
Chung never produced a key for the moped.
On October 8, 2012, Chung was charged with
"intentionally or knowingly exert[ing] unauthorized control over
a propelled vehicle, by operating the vehicle without the consent
of George Calventas, owner of said vehicle, thereby committing
the offense of Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle, in
violation of [HRS § 708-836]."
On February 26, 2014 and February 27, 2014, the circuit
court held a jury trial on Chung's charges.  At the trial, Chung
testified that he bought the moped from an acquaintance, Dell,
who he met through his friend, Joe.  Chung stated that when he
first noted the ignition was missing it "raised some alarms" and
that his "initial thought was it might be stolen."  Chung
testified that Dell told him that "somebody had tried to steal
[the moped] and that's why he was getting rid of it."  Chung
testified that he had Joe "call up 911 or the Satellite City
Hall" to "check to see if the thing was stolen or not."  After 5
minutes on the phone, Chung testified that Joe gave him a "thumbs
up," which he took to mean that "the moped was clean and it
wasn't reported stolen."  Chung testified that he had not
received the registration after purchasing Dell's moped because
"[Dell] promised [him] within two days he would get the
registration and the paperwork."
After all witnesses had testified and outside the
presence of the jury, the circuit court settled the jury
instructions, which included proposed instruction numbers 17 and
20 that stated:
COURT'S GENERAL INSTRUCTION NO. 17 [(Instruction 17)]
The state of mind with which a person "intentionally"
or "knowingly" commits an act may be proved by NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circumstantial evidence. While witnesses may see and hear,
and thus be able to give direct evidence of what a person
does or fails to do, there can be no eye-witness account of
the state of mind with which the acts are done or omitted.
 But what a person does or fails to do may or may not
indicate the state of mind with which he does or refrains
 from doing an act.
 
. . . .
 
COURT'S GENERAL INSTRUCTION NO. 20 [(Instruction 20)]
 
[Chung], is charged with the offense of Unauthorized
Control of Propelled Vehicle.
 
A person commits the offense of Unauthorized Control
of Propelled Vehicle if he intentionally or knowingly exerts
unauthorized control over another's propelled vehicle by
operating the vehicle without the owner's consent.
 
There are three material elements of the offense of
 
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle, each of which the
prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
These three elements are:
 
1. That, on or about the 4th day of October, 2012, in
the City and County of Honolulu, [Chung], exerted
unauthorized control over [Calventas'] propelled vehicle;
and
 
2. That [Chung], did so by operating the vehicle
without [Calventas'] consent; and
 
3. That [Chung], did so intentionally or knowingly.
 
"Owner" means the registered owner of the propelled vehicle
or the unrecorded owner of the vehicle pending transfer of
ownership; provided that if there is no registered owner of the
propelled vehicle or unrecorded owner of the vehicle pending
transfer of ownership, "owner" means the legal owner.
 
"Propelled vehicle" means an automobile, airplane,
motorcycle, motorboat, or other motor-propelled vehicle.
 
The circuit court noted that Instructions 17 and 20 were "given
 
by agreement." Neither the prosecutor nor the defense counsel
 objected to the use of the instructions as proposed. When the
 jury returned, the circuit court instructed the jury as to the
 agreed upon instructions, including Instructions 17 and 20.
 
On June 3, 2014, the circuit court sentenced Chung,
 
inter alia, to five years HOPE Probation3
 with a term of
imprisonment of one year, subject to early release to a
 
3
 Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) Probation
is a program designed to reduce probation violations by drug offenders and
others at high risk of recidivism.

residential substance abuse program. On the same day, the
 
circuit court filed its "Judgment of Conviction and Probation
 Sentence."
 
On June 19, 2014, Chung filed this timely notice of
 
appeal.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Jury Instructions
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that 
although as a general matter forfeited assignments of error
are to be reviewed under [Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP)] Rule 52(b) plain error standard of review, in thecase of erroneous jury instructions, that standard of reviewis effectively merged with the HRPP Rule 52(a) harmlesserror standard of review because it is the duty of the trialcourt to properly instruct the jury. As a result, onceinstructional error is demonstrated, we will vacate, withoutregard to whether timely objection was made, if there is areasonable possibility that the error contributed to the
defendant's conviction, i.e., that the erroneous jury
instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
State v. Nichols, 111 Hawai 'i 327, 337, 141 P.3d 974, 984 (2006) 
(footnote omitted). Thus, the appellant must first demonstrate
 
instructional error by rebutting the "presumption that
 unobjected-to jury instructions are correct." Id. at 337 n.6,
 
141 P.3d at 984 n.6; accord State v. Eberly, 107 Hawai
'i 239, 
250, 112 P.3d 725, 736 (2005). If the appellant is able to rebut
 this presumption, the burden shifts to the State to prove that
 the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because
 
[e]rroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a
ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the
record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial.
However, error is not to be viewed in isolation and
considered purely in the abstract. It must be examined in
 the light of the entire proceedings and given the effect
which the whole record shows it to be entitled.
 
Nichols, 111 Hawai 'i at 334, 141 P.3d at 981 (brackets in 
original omitted) (quoting State v. Gonsalves, 108 Hawai 'i 289, 
293, 119 P.3d 597, 601 (2005)).
B. Motion for Mistrial
 
The denial of a motion for mistrial is within the 
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be upset absent a clear abuse of discretion. State v. 
Loa, 83 Hawai' i 335, 349, 926 P.2d 1258,
1272 . . . (1996) (citations omitted). "'The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceedsthe bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
party litigant.'" State v. Ganal, 81 Hawai' i 358,
373, 917 P.2d 370, 385 (1996) (quoting State v.Furutani, 76 Hawai' i 172, 178-79, 873 P.2d 51, 57-58
(1994)). 
State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai' i 405, 411, 984 P.2d 1231, 1237
(1999). 
State v. Plichta, 116 Hawai 'i 200, 214, 172 P.3d 512, 526 (2007). 
C. Juror Misconduct
 
As a general matter, the granting or denial of a motion for
new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court
 and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of
 discretion. The same principle is applied in the context of
a motion for new trial premised on juror misconduct. 
"The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly
exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant."
 * * *
 
. . . Because the right to an impartial jury in a criminal
trial is so fundamental to our entire judicial
system, . . . a criminal defendant is entitled to twelve
impartial jurors. Thus, the trial court must grant a motion
for new trial if any member (or members) of the jury was not
impartial; failure to do so necessarily constitutes an abuse
of discretion.
 
State v. Augustin, 89 Hawai 'i 215, 219, 971 P.2d 304, 308 (App. 
1998) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Furutani, 76 Hawai 'i 
172, 178-79, 873 P.2d 51, 57-58 (1994)).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Jury Instructions
 
Chung contends Instruction 20 was plainly erroneous
 
because "the three so-called elements/paragraphs [in Instruction

 
20] did not each correspond to a lone material element." Chung
 
argues that Instruction 20 invited the jury to overlook the state
 of mind requirements for a UCPV charge because "Instruction No.
 20 Element No. 3 failed to require that the jury specifically
 determine whether Chung acted intentionally or knowingly as to
 EACH bona fide material element[.]"
4 We disagree.
 
4
 Chung also argues that Instruction 17, when read together with
Instruction 20, "de-emphasized the importance of state-of-mind" by instructing
that the "state of mind with which a person 'intentionally' or 'knowingly'
(continued...)
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 708-836 provides that "[a] person commits the
 
offense of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle if the
 
person intentionally or knowingly exerts unauthorized control
 over another's propelled vehicle by operating the vehicle without
 the owner's consent or by changing the identity of the vehicle
 without the owner's consent." Instruction 20 mirrored the
 statutory language of HRS § 708-836 verbatim, but also provided a
 list of three material elements that the jury needed to find in
 order to find Chung guilty of UCPV. The material elements
 described in Instruction 20 provided
 
There are three material elements of the offense of
 
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle, each of which the
prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
These three elements are:
 
1. That, on or about the 4th day of October, 2012, in
the City and County of Honolulu, [Chung] exerted
unauthorized control over [Calventas'] propelled vehicle
[(Element 1)]; and
 
2. That [Chung] did so by operating the vehicle
without [Calventas'] consent [(Element 2)]; and
 
3. That [Chung] did so intentionally or knowingly.
 
[(Element 3)]
 
The "intentionally or knowingly" state of mind applies to the 
other enumerated elements of the UCPV offense. See State v. 
Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i 235, 251, 178 P.3d 1, 17 (2008); see also 
HRS § 702-207 (2014 Repl.). 
The circuit court's jury instruction included all the 
requisite elements of a UCPV offense. Also, the words "did so" and "or" found in Element 3 of Instruction 20 sufficiently indicated that one of the two states of mind had to be proven with respect to the preceding enumerated elements of the offense. See State v. Vliet, 95 Hawai
'i 94, 100, 19 P.3d 42, 48 (2001). 
4(...continued)
commits an act may be proved by circumstantial evidence." 
We take this time 
to note that the Hawai' i Supreme Court has repeated held that "[g]iven the
difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct evidence in
criminal cases, proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferencesarising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient."State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996). See State v. 
Agard, 113 Hawai' i 321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007); State v. Stocker, 90 
Hawai'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999); State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 254,
831 P.2d 924, 934 (1992). 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, the circuit court's jury instruction was not 
erroneous. See id. ("While we do not necessarily endorse the 
form of this instruction, we cannot say it was defective."); see also State v. Palisbo, 93 Hawai
'i 344, 351, 354, 3 P.3d 510, 517, 
520 (App. 2000) (holding that a nearly identical UCPV state of mind instruction was not "prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading." (citation and quotation marks omitted.)).
5 
B. Motion for Mistrial
 
Chung contends the circuit court erred in not granting
 
his request for a mistrial because Juror No. 2's "inflammatory
 negative comments to the other eleven deliberating jurors
 constituted a highly prejudicial judgment about Chung's character
 (including his ethics, integrity, and honesty), ergo his
 credibility."
 
This court has held that "[t]he sixth amendment to the 
United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawai
'i Constitution guarantee the criminally accused a fair 
trial by an impartial jury." State v. Bailey, 126 Hawai 'i 383, 
399, 271 P.3d 1142, 1158 (2012). "Inherent in this requirement is that a defendant receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside influences." State v. Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. 356, 
357,569 P.2d 891, 892 (1977) (citation and quotation marks omitted). "The jury's verdict must be based upon evidence received in open court and not from outside sources." Id. 
The following framework has been developed to determine
 
whether an outside influence prejudices a defendant's right to a
 fair trial:
 
Once there is a claim that an accused is being denied his or
her right to a fair trial because of outside influences
infecting a jury,
 
the initial step for the trial court to take . . . is
to determine whether the nature of the [outside
influence] rises to the level of being substantially
prejudicial. "If it does not rise to such a level, the
trial court is under no duty to interrogate the
jury . . . And whether it does rise to the level of
 
5
 We note that the format used for Instruction 20 is a standard
 
format used in the Hawaii Criminal Jury Instructions.
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
substantial prejudice . . . is ordinarily a question
'committed to the trial court's discretion . . . .'" 
Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. at 359, 569 P.2d at 895 (citations
omitted). Where the trial court does determine that such
influence is of a nature which could substantially prejudice
the defendant's right to a fair trial, a rebuttable
presumption of prejudice is raised. The trial judge is then
duty bound to further investigate the totality of
circumstances surrounding the outside influence to determine
its impact on jury impartiality. Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. 356,
569 P.2d 891; State v. Messamore, 2 Haw. App. 643, 639 P.2d
413 (1982). The standard to be applied in overcoming such a
presumption is that the outside influence on the jury must
be proven harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v.
Amorin, 58 Haw. 623, 574 P.2d 895 (1978); State v. Pokini,
55 Haw. 640, 526 P.2d 94 (1974). The trial court, in its
investigation of the totality of circumstances, should
include individual examination of potentially tainted
jurors, outside the presence of the other jurors, to
determine the influence, if any, of the extraneous matters.
 
State v. Williamson, 72 Haw. 97, 102, 807 P.2d 593, 596 (1991); 
see also  State v. Napulou, 85 Hawai 'i 49, 56, 936 P.2d 1297, 
1304 (App. 1997). 
Although the circuit court individually questioned each
 
juror, Chung argues that "[t]he court's questioning failed to
 elicit substantive and substantial evidence to overcome the
 presumption of prejudice." In support of his argument, Chung
 argues that his case is factually similar to the facts in Pokini. 
We disagree.
 
In Pokini, the defendants were sentenced to thirty 
years in prison for their alleged part in a high profile robbery. Pokini, 55 Haw. at 640-41, 526 P.2d at 98. During voir dire, the trial judge refused to allow any inquiry into the extent and nature of the publicity to which jurors claimed to have been exposed before trial. Pokini, 55 Haw. at 643, 526 P.2d at 100. 
On appeal to the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, the defendants alleged 
that by not questioning the jurors further, the trial judge had denied their right to a fair trial. Id. 
The supreme court held that "[w]here pre-trial
 
publicity is as extensive and as likely prejudicial as it was
 here, the constitutional right to an impartial jury requires
 examination into objective as well as subjective indicia of
 non-prejudice." Id. As an example, the supreme court cited to
 
Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 638 (9th Cir. 1968)
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
where "the [9th Circuit Court] held that extensive pre-trial
 
publicity of the case compelled the trial judge on voir dire of
 prospective jurors to ascertain 'what information the jurors had
 accumulated" and opined that "[a]bbreviated inquiry into the
 jurors' subjective ability to be fair and impartial was
 inadequate[.]" Pokini, 55 Haw. at 643, 526 P.2d at 100. The
 
court in Pokini noted that instead of determining the "extent and
 nature of the specific matters of publicity to which jurors had
 been exposed[,]" "the trial judge relied on perfunctory and
 generalized questions which elicited responses from these juror
 solely on their subjective ability to ignore pre-trial publicity
 and be fair and impartial." Id. Because the trial judge in
 
Pokini failed to consider crucial evidence of possible juror
 bias, the supreme court held that his decision to not to excuse
 jurors for cause was rendered "fatally uninformed" and, thus,
 constituted reversible error. Id. at 643, 526 P.2d at 101.
 
Pokini is distinguishable from the facts of this case
 
on appeal. Unlike the trial judge in Pokini, the circuit court
 gathered sufficient evidence to make an informed determination
 that the remaining eleven jurors in Chung's trial could remain
 fair and impartial. The circuit court asked each juror
 individually whether Juror No. 2 talked to him or her about the
 encounter with Chung, whether Juror No. 2 shared her impressions
 of Chung with the juror and what those impressions were, whether
 Juror No. 2's shared impression would affect the juror's ability
 to be a fair and impartial in Chung's case, and whether the juror
 would be able to base his or her decision solely on the evidence
 that was presented in the case and not Juror No. 2's impression.
 Each juror shared with the circuit court what he or she heard
 from Juror No. 2 and indicated that, regardless of Juror No. 2's
 statements, he or she could remain a fair and impartial juror.
 Thus, unlike Pokini, the circuit court's inquiry was sufficient
 to elicit the type of evidence necessary for the court to assess
 each juror's objective and subjective ability to disregard Juror
 No. 2's impressions and remain fair and impartial. 
Furthermore, after the circuit court excused Juror No.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
2, Chung's defense counsel was permitted to question the
 
remaining jurors. Chung's counsel asked jurors whether they
 would be able to remind the jury that they are not to consider
 Juror No. 2's opinion, if another juror were to bring up her
 opinion during deliberations. Each juror asked indicated that he
 or she would be able to do so. Given the nature of the outside
 influence and the remaining eleven jurors' unequivocal responses
 that indicated that they could remain fair and impartial, the
 circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Chung's
 motion for a mistrial. See Napulou,
 85 Hawai 'i at 56, 936 P.2d 
at 1304. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Therefore, the "Judgment of Conviction and Probation
 
Sentence," entered on June 3, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
