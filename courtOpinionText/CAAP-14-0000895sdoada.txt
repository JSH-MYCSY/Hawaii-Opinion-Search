BRELIE GAIL BALON TUMANENG, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
BRIXON ANDRES TUMANENG, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 12-1-7982)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J. and Fujise, J.,
with Ginoza, J. dissenting)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Brelie Gail Balon Tumaneng (
Brelie)
 
appeals from the "Orders Re Plaintiff's Motion and Declaration
 
for Post-Decree Relief Filed September 11, 2013" entered on April
 
1
14, 2014 in the Family Court of the First Circuit  (family
 
court
).
 
On appeal, Brelie contends the family court erred when

 
it (1) excluded all evidence prior to the April 4, 2013 divorce
 decree, which included evidence of abusive conduct and neglect by
 Defendant-Appellee Brixon Andres Tumaneng (Brixon), and the care
 
given to the minor child by Brelie and the child's maternal
 
grandmother; and (2) awarded child custody without making
 findings regarding the best interests of the child.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments and the issues raised by the parties, as well as

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Brelie's appeal
 
is without merit.
 
I. Exclusion of Evidence Prior to April 4, 2013
 
Brelie argues that she should have been permitted to
 
introduce evidence of domestic violence that occurred before the
 
entry of the original April 4, 2013 divorce decree.
 
In moving to exclude evidence prior to the divorce 
decree, Brixon relied on Nadeau v. Nadeau, 10 Haw. App. 111, 121, 861 P.2d 754, 759 (1993), which requires the person seeking a change of custody or visitation to "show a material change of circumstances since the previous custody order, and must show that such a change of custody is in the best interest of the child." Upon a finding of a material change, the relevant inquiry is whether the material change itself is sufficient to alter the best interests of the child. See Id. ("The question 
is, based on what facts did the family court reduce Father's summer visitation from two and one-half months to six weeks?"); Hollaway v. Hollaway, 133 Hawai
'i 415, 417-20, 422-23, 329 P.3d 
320, 322-25, 327-28 (App. 2014) (focusing on the evidence underlying the family court's finding regarding educational decision-making authority which related to the parents' impasse over their son's education--the material change in circumstance justifying modification). Thus, Brelie was required to show that the evidence of domestic violence prior to the divorce decree was related to Brixon's pending relocation to Arizona. Brelie did not show such a relation. Therefore, there is no basis to find that the family court committed plain error. Doe v. Doe, 98 
Hawai
'i 144, 154, 44 P.3d 1085, 1095 (2002). 
Brelie asserts that the family court's ruling was
 
erroneously based on the principles of res judicata. However,
 the family court's ruling was based on the relevance of the
 evidence under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 402.

 HRE Rule 402 provides: 
Rule 402 Relevant evidence generally admissible;
irrelevant evidence inadmissible. All relevant evidence is
 
admissible, except as otherwise provided by the

by statute, by these rules, or by other rules adopted by the
supreme court.  Evidence which is not relevant is not
admissible.
3II. Best Interests of the Child Finding
Brelie argues the family court failed to make any
findings regarding the best interests of the child, both in the
oral rulings of the court and in the court's written orders.  In
its "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law," the family court
stated:
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.Based upon the reliable and credible evidence
including the exhibits admitted into evidence,
the testimony of the parties and witnesses and
the argument of counsel, The Court finds that it
is the best interest of the minor child that the
parties are awarded joint legal custody and sole
physical custody to [Brixon] with reasonable
visitation to [Brelie].  If parties reside in
the same jurisdiction they will share joint
physical custody.
. . . .
4.However, even if [Brixon's] reassignment outside
of Hawaii was not contemplated and the Court
were to find that this was a Material change in
Circumstance, the Court finds that it is in the
Child's best interest to live with [Brixon].
Brelie clarifies in her reply brief that the family court's
conclusions were objectionable because they were categorized
under "Conclusions of Law" (COL ) rather than "Findings of Fact"
(FOF).
COL 6 stated "To the extent that any [FOF] herein may
be a [COL], it shall be so construed.  To the extent that a [COL]
herein may be a [FOF], it shall be so construed."  Even without
COL 6, the family court's determination that it was within the
child's best interests to be placed with Brixon was a mixed
question of law and fact.  In re Doe , 95 Hawai #i 185, 190, 20
P.3d 616, 623 (2001).  The family court's characterization of its
determination as a "COL" rather than a "FOF" does not mean the
family court "awarded custody of the child without making any
findings regarding the best interest of the child[,]" as Brelie
contends.  As such, the family court's determination of the bestNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
interest of the child was not clear error. Fisher v. Fisher, 111
 
Hawai'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Orders Re Plaintiff's
 
Motion and Declaration for Post-Decree Relief Filed September 11,
 2013" entered on April 14, 2014 in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit is affirmed.
