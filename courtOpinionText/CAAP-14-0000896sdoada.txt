IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
YVONNE M. YOSHIMOTO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KANE'OHE DIVISION
 
(1DTA-13-02223)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Yvonne M. Yoshimoto (Yoshimoto) 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, entered on May 28, 2014 in the District Court of the First Circuit, K
ane'ohe Division (District Court).1 
Yoshimoto was convicted of Operating a Vehicle Under
 
the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2015).
 
On appeal, Yoshimoto contends the District Court erred
 
by (1) incorporating pretrial motions into the trial over her
 objection, (2) hearing pretrial motions on the same day as trial,
 (3) depriving her of the right to obtain transcripts of the
 pretrial motions' hearing, (4) denying her motion to dismiss for
 failure to define the term "alcohol" in the charge, (5) failing
 to find a Brady violation when the State demanded payment to

inspect discovery, and (6) denying her motion to dismiss for 
violation of Rule 48 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) and failing to make any findings of fact to support the denial. 
The State concedes that the District Court erred by
 
failing to hold a separate hearing on Yoshimoto's motion to
 suppress prior to trial over Yoshimoto's objection.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Yoshimoto's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Yoshimoto claims the District Court erred by
 
incorporating testimony from her pretrial motions to suppress
 into the trial over her objection. The State concedes that this
 was reversible error under State v. Thomas, 72 Haw. 48, 805 P.2d
 1212 (1991). "[A] motion to suppress made before trial shall be
 determined before trial[.]" HRPP Rule 12(e). "[F]ailure to
 decide a motion to suppress prior to trial constitutes reversible
 error." Thomas, 72 Haw. at 53, 805 P.2d at 1214 (citing State v.
 
Rodgers, 70 Haw. 156, 776 P.2d 675 (1988)). "The only occasion
 where a court need not decide a motion to suppress prior to trial
 is where the parties agree to consolidate the hearing on the
 motion with trial pursuant to our holding in State v. Doyle, 64
 Haw. 229, 638 P.2d 332 (1981)." Id. Yoshimoto filed several
 
motions to suppress on November 13, 2013, prior to the start of
 her trial on May 28, 2014. Yoshimoto objected to incorporation
 of testimony for pretrial motions into trial. Therefore, the
 District Court erred by failing to determine Yoshimoto's motions
 to suppress prior to trial which constituted reversible error.
 
(2) Yoshimoto contends the District Court erred by
 
conducting pretrial motions on the same day as trial. To the
 extent that Yoshimoto re-alleges that the hearing on pretrial
 motions should not have been incorporated with trial, that issue
 has been addressed above. Yoshimoto failed to cite where in the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record she objected to hearing pretrial motions on the same day 
of trial generally. Therefore, she has failed to preserve this point of error which we will disregard. Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). 
(3) Yoshimoto contends that her due process rights
 
were violated because she was denied the ability to obtain
 transcripts of testimony from pretrial motions when the motions
 were heard contemporaneously with trial. As noted above, the
 District Court erred by failing to determine the motion to
 suppress prior to trial. Therefore, the point of error is moot.
 
(4) The District Court did not err by denying 
Yoshimoto's motion to dismiss because the complaint was not fatally defective for failing to define the term "alcohol." State v. Tsujimura, CAAP-14-0001302, slip. op. at 4 (App. Jan. 27, 2016) and State v. Turping, 136 Hawai
'i 333, 336-37, 361 
P.3d 1236, 1239-40 (App. 2015), cert. denied, SCWC-13-0002957 (May 20, 2015). 
(5) Yoshimoto contends that the District Court erred
 
by denying Yoshimoto's motion to dismiss for violating Brady v.
 Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Yoshimoto argues that it is
 unconstitutional to require payment to inspect discovery that the
 State has an obligation to disclose under Brady and HRPP Rule 16. 
The District Court found that there was no Brady violation
 because the State timely made discovery available but Yoshimoto
 refused to pay for copying costs.
 
We note that the State cites no authority for the
 
proposition that it may condition the disclosure of Brady
 materials, or discovery in general, on the defendant paying
 copying costs. While it may be permissible for the State to
 charge a defendant for copying costs where the defendant requests
 copies of materials subject to disclosure, the State cannot
 condition the disclosure of Brady material or discovery on the
 payment for copies that the defendant only seeks to view. See
 
HRPP Rule 16(e)(1) (providing that the parties may perform their
 disclosure obligations in any manner mutually agreed upon or by
 notifying the attorney for the other party that discovery
 materials may be "inspected, obtained, tested, copied or
 photographed at specified reasonable times and places"). Thus,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the District Court erred to the extent that it found no Brady
 
violation because Yoshimoto refused to pay for copying costs. 
However, Yoshimoto did not take steps to ensure that the
 contested materials were included in the record on appeal. 
Accordingly, this court has no basis on which to determine
 whether the material withheld qualified as Brady material. On
 remand, the District Court should determine whether Yoshimoto is
 entitled to disclosure of the subject materials under Brady.
 
Discovery under HRPP Rule 16 is subject to the trial
 
court's discretion in non-felony cases.
2 Relying on State ex rel
 
Marsland v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304, 313-16, 788 P.2d 1281, 1286-88
 (1990), Yoshimoto argued below that the State was required to
 provide "the relevant waiver forms, Intoxilyzer and/or blood test
 results, operational checklists, witness statements, and
 maintenance logs," without submitting a written request for
 disclosure or motion to compel discovery. Ames did not decide
 
such information was required to be disclosed under Brady. In
 any case, the charge against Yoshimoto for violating HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) was dismissed with prejudice. Therefore, most of the
 requested information, pursuant to Ames, appears moot. 
Nonetheless, on remand, the District Court should determine the
 extent to which Yoshimoto is entitled to discovery under HRPP
 Rule 16(d) as it relates to a charge for violating HRS § 291E­61(a)(1).
 
(6) The District Court did not err by denying 
Yoshimoto's motion to dismiss for violation of HRPP Rule 48 without any findings of fact. Yoshimoto was arrested on May 6, 2013 and charged on June 4, 2013 with OVUII. Therefore, pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(b), Yoshimoto's trial must commence within 180 days from her arrest on May 6, 2013. State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai
'i 
17, 28, 881 P.2d 504, 515 (1994). On June 6, 2013 Yoshimoto filed a motion for a continuance of arraignment and plea from June 12 to July 10, 2013 which was granted. On June 24, 2013

 HRPP Rule 16 "is limited to cases in which the defendant is
 
charged with a felony" except that "[u]pon a showing of materiality and if the
request is reasonable, the court in its discretion may require disclosure as
provided for in this Rule 16 in cases other than those in which the defendant
is charged with a felony[.]" HRPP Rule 16(a) and (d).
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Yoshimoto filed a second motion for a continuance of arraignment
 
and plea from July 10 to August 14, 2013 which was granted.3
 
Both motions delayed the setting of a trial date. On
 November 13, 2013, Yoshimoto filed multiple motions to dismiss
 and motions to suppress. Yoshimoto's trial did not commence
 until May 28, 2014. However, as noted above, the District Court
 incorporated the hearings on Yoshimoto's motions to suppress with
 trial on May 28, 2014.
 
Excludable time periods for purposes of HRPP Rule 48
 
include "periods that delay the commencement of trial and are
 caused by a continuance granted at the request or with the
 consent of the defendant or defendant's counsel." HRPP
 Rule 48(c)(3). Thus the 28 and 35 days respectively, granted to
 Yoshimoto for her arraignment and plea were excludable because
 they delayed the setting of her trial date, and consequently
 extended the 180 day Rule 48 deadline from November 2, 2013 to
 Janaury 4, 2014.
 
Also excudable are "periods that delay the commencement
 
of trial and are caused by collateral or other proceedings
 concerning the defendant[.]" HRPP Rule 48(c)(1). "For purposes
 of subsection (c)(1) of this rule, the period of time, from the
 filing through the prompt disposition of the following motions
 filed by a defendant, shall be deemed to be periods of delay
 resulting from collateral or other proceedings concerning the
 defendant: motions to dismiss, to suppress, . . . " HRPP
 Rule 48(d)(1). Therefore, the time while Yoshimoto's motions to
 suppress were pending disposition, from November 13, 2013 to
 May 28, 2014, was also excluded for purposes of HRPP Rule 48
 because the District Court did not dispose of the motions until
 the day of trial. State v. Sujohn, 64 Haw. 516, 520-21, 644 P.2d
 
1326, 1328-29 (1982). Therefore, HRPP Rule 48 was not violated.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on May 28, 2014
 
3
 The order granting the continuance specified that the matter was
continued to August 21 instead of August 14 as requested, but another motion
to advance the matter back to August 14 was granted.
