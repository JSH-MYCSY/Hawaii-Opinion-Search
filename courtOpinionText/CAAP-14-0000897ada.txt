jurisdiction to grant the Petition;
 
(2) failing to consider and apply Hawai 'i Probate Rules 
(HPR) 3 and 10 when dismissing Ramos' Petition; and 
(3) requiring Ramos to commence a proceeding before the
 
appointment of a personal representation.
I. BACKGROUND
 
On April 15, April 22, and April 29, 2013, Respondents-
Appellees Estate of Peter Joseph Elsenbach, Elsenbach Children's
 
Trust, and Christopher Elsenbach (collectively, Respondents),
 
published "Notice to Creditors of Peter Joseph Elsenbach" in the
 
West Hawaii Today newspaper (Notice to Creditors). The Notice to
 
Creditors stated, in pertinent part, "All creditors of the above-
name decedent [Peter Joseph Elsenbach] and/or trust are hereby
 notified to present their claim . . . within four (4) months from
 the date of the first publication of this notice, or they will be
 forever barred."
 
On August 15, 2013, Ramos prepared and delivered four
 
"Creditor's Claims" to Respondents.
 
In separate letters dated and mailed on August 21,
 
2013, Respondents' attorney notified Ramos that all four of her
 claims dated August 15, 2013 were disallowed (disallowance
 
letters). The disallowance letters indicated that "if [she]
 
wish[ed] to pursue the claim, [she] must petition the probate
 
court or commence a proceeding for allowance of the claim no
 later than sixty days after the mailing of this letter" and that
 "[f]ailure to take action within [the] sixty-day period will bar
 [her] from future action to enforce [her] claim."
 
On October 22, 2013, Ramos filed her Petition. Ramos'
 
Petition sought to claim the following from Respondents:
 
A) $500.00 to reimburse money borrowed from a friend
to buy back some of my personal property that was being sold

at an estate sale by the new owners of my previous marital
residence.
 
B) $360,000.00 for my providing 24 hour per day care
giving services for nine (9) years to Decedent that he
medically needed, but he refused to hire a nurse to provide
at least the nighttime services when he required his air
mask to be put back on him every 45 to 60 minutes from 8PM
to 7AM on every single night of the week, and I saved his
life three (3) times in the nine (9) years (Once he was
totally flat lined).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
C) $344,500.00 for my personal property that consisted
of approximately 1/3rd I brought into our marriage and
approximately 1/3rd I earned and brought into our nine (9)
year pre-marital relationship and approximately 1/3rd that
 
were gifts to me from both my friends and Decedent (this was
part of the prior divorce court property return orders).
 
D) $187,400.00 for my one-half of the joint property
provision of the Divorce Decree, and $4,757,018.76 comprises
my one-half of the joint financial asset provision of the 
Divorce Decree (This amount is provided that the family

releases all interest they may have in the Delrow Family
Trust that I care take [sic] for the trustee, since Decedent
committed fraud by borrowing me my [sic] own money and
stating it was his money and that I owed him for it).
 
On December 2, 2013, Respondents filed their objection to Ramos'
 
Petition.
 
The circuit court held hearings on Ramos' Petition on
 
January 6, 2014 and February 10, 2014.2 On May 22, 2014, the
 
circuit court entered its Order, finding that it did not have
 jurisdiction over Ramos' Petition because her Petition was
 untimely. The circuit court dismissed Ramos' Petition with
 prejudice. On June 20, 2014, Ramos filed her notice of appeal.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that [the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong standard." Captain Andy's Sailing, Inc., v. Dep't of Land and 
Natural Res., 113 Hawai
'i 184, 192, 150 P.3d 833, 841 (2006) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
III. DISCUSSION
 
Ramos contends the circuit court erred in finding that
 
it lacked jurisdiction to grant Ramos' Petition. The circuit
 court found that, under Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) 560:3-806(a)
 
(2006 Repl.), it did not have jurisdiction over Ramos' Petition
 
because she failed to file her Petition within sixty days from
 when Respondents mailed their disallowance letters.
 
HRS § 560:3-806(a) provides:
 
§560:3-806 Allowance of claims. (a) As to claims
 
presented in the manner described in section 560:3-804
within the time limit prescribed in section 560:3-803, the
personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant
stating that the claim has been disallowed. . . . Every

 Transcripts from the January 6, 2014 and February 10, 2014
hearings were not included in the record on appeal.

claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the
personal representative is barred so far as not allowed
unless the claimant files a petition for allowance in the
court or commences a proceeding against the personal
representative not later than sixty days after the mailing
of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the
notice warns the claimant of the impending bar. If the
 notice does not warn the claimant of the impending sixty-day
bar, then the claim shall be barred if no petition for
allowance or other proceeding on the claim has been brought
within eighteen months of the date of the decedent's death.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Respondents mailed their disallowance letters to Ramos
 
on August 21, 2013. The disallowance letters specifically
 
indicated that "if [she] wish[ed] to pursue the claim, [she] must
 petition the probate court or commence a proceeding for allowance
 of the claim no later than sixty days after the mailing of this
 letter" and warned that "[f]ailure to take action within [the]
 sixty-day period will bar [her] from future action to enforce
 [her] claim." Thus, HRS § 560:3-806(a) required Ramos to file
 her Petition in the circuit court within sixty days. 
Computation of time in probate proceedings are governed
 
by HPR Rule 10.
3 Under HPR Rule 10(d), "[w]henever a person has
 
3
 HRS § 560:1-304 (2006 Repl.) provides that "[u]nless specifically
provided to the contrary in this chapter or unless inconsistent with its
provisions, the Hawai' i probate rules govern formal and informal proceedings
under this chapter."
 
HPR Rule 10 provides in relevant part:

 
Rule 10. COMPUTATION OF TIME.
 
(a) Computation. In computing any period of time
prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of
court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the
act, event, or default after which the designated
period of time begins to run is not to be included.
The last day of the period so computed is to be
included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal
holiday, in which event the period runs until the end
of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday,
nor a legal holiday. When the period of time
prescribed or allowed is less than seven days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be
excluded in the computation. As used in this rule,
"holiday" includes any day designated as such pursuant
to Section 8-1 of the [HRS].
 
. . . .
 
(d) Additional Time After Service by Mail. Whenever a
 
person has the right or is required to act within a

the right or is required to act within a prescribed period after
 
the service of a notice or other paper upon the person and the
 notice or paper is served upon the person by mail, two days shall
 be added to the prescribed period." (Emphasis added.) The
 commentary to HPR Rule 10(d) indicates that "[t]his rule conforms
 the timing requirements with respect to mailings to other court
 rules."
 
In Rivera v. Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations, 100 
Hawai
'i 348, 350, 60 P.3d 298, 300 (2002), the Hawai 'i Supreme 
Court applied the two-day mail rule provided in Hawai 'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 6(e) to compute the prescribed period 
for appealing an agency's decision under HRS § 91-14(b) (2012 
Repl.). "HRS § 91-14(b) provides in relevant part: '(b) . . . proceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit court within thirty days . . . after service of the certified copy of the final decision and order of the agency pursuant to rule of court[.]" Rivera, 100 Hawai
'i at 349, 60 
P.3d at 299. The supreme court noted that "[t]he statute is mandatory with respect to commencement of review proceedings within the time prescribed." Id. Because HRCP Rule 5(b)(3), 
provides that service is complete upon mailing, the supreme court held that HRCP Rule 6(e) operated to provide the parties with two additional days to file a notice of appeal. Id. The supreme 
court reasoned that the two day mail rule is meant to "alleviate any unfairness that might be caused by transmission by mail."

prescribed period after the service of a notice or other

paper upon the person and the notice or paper is served upon
the person by mail, two days shall be added to the
prescribed period.
 
4
 The Hawai' i Supreme Court in Rivera cited Professors Wright and 
Miller's analysis of HRCP Rule 6(e)'s Federal Rules of Civil Procedurecounterpart to support its policy determination: 
Professors Wright and Miller have commented that the
counterpart Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure ("FRCP"), which provides an additional three
days to take action where service has been made by
mail,
 
clearly is intended to protect parties who

Id. at 351, 60 P.3d at 301. 
Similarly, this court has supported use of the two-day 
mail rule. In In re Brandon, 113 Hawai 'i 154, 158, 149 P.3d 806, 
810 (2006) this court utilized Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) 
§ 6-61-21(e) (2005), which added two days to the prescribed 
period for filing a motion for reconsideration or rehearing under HRS § 271-32(b) (2007 Repl.), to determine that appellant's motion for reconsideration of a Public Utility Commission (PUC) 
order was untimely. "When an aggrieved party intends to appeal 
from a PUC order, '[t]he motion for reconsideration or a rehearing shall be filed within ten days after the decision and order has been served[.]'" In re Brandon, 113 Hawai
'i at 157, 
149 P.3d at 809 (citing HRS § 271-32(b)); see also HAR § 6-61-137 (2005) ("The motion shall be filed within ten days after the decision or order is served upon the party[.]"). Because service of the PUC order was effective on the date when "the document is properly stamped, addressed, and mailed to the last known address of the party on file with the commission or to its attorney[,]" the two-day mail rule, under HAR § 6-61-21(e), applied to give the aggrieved party two additional days to file a motion for reconsideration of the order. In re Brandon, at 157-58, 149 P.3d 
at 809-10 (brackets omitted). 
In Waikiki Marketplace Inv. Co. v. Chair of Zoning Bd.
 
4(...continued)
are served notice by mail from suffering a

systematic diminution of their time to
respond through the application of Rule
5(b), which provides that service is
complete upon mailing, not receipt; the
additional three days provided by Rule
6(e) to the party being served represent a
reasonable transmission time, and a fair
compromise between the harshness of
measuring strictly from the date of
mailing and the indefiniteness of
attempting to measure from the date of
receipt, which in many cases would be
unverifiable.
 
4A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure: Civil 2d § 1171, at 514-15 (1987). 
Rivera, 100 Hawai' i at 351 n.4, 60 P.3d at 301 n.4. We note that FRCP Rule 
6(e) became Rule 6(d) in 2007.

of Appeals of City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 86 Hawai 'i 343, 349, 949 
P.2d 183, 189 (App. 1997), this court determined how to compute 
the prescribed time for appealing a Department of Land Utilization (DLU) Director's decision to the Zoning Board of 
Appeal (ZBA), pursuant to ZBA Rule 3.2. A "written petition 
appealing an action of the [DLU] Director must be received at the 
[DLU] within 30 days of the date of mailing or personal service of the [DLU] Director's written decision[.]" Waikiki 
Marketplace, 86 Hawai
'i at 349, 949 P.2d at 189 (citing ZBA Rule 
3.2). One question at issue in Waikiki Marketplace was whether HRCP Rule 5(b) applied to ZBA Rule 3.2 to determine the manner in which the court was to calculate the date the DLU Director's decision was mailed. Id. at 350, 949 P.2d at 190. Although the 
court in Waikiki Marketplace held that HRCP Rule 5(b) was not applicable to a petition from the DLU Director to the ZBA, the court noted that if it were applicable, HRCP Rule 5(b) would invoke HRCP Rule 6(e) adding two additional days to the prescribed period. Id. at 350-51, 949 P.2d at 190-91. 
This court has previously declined to apply the two-day
 
mail rule where a statute's legislative history indicates an
 intent that the rule not apply. See Danielson v. Tanaka, 9 Haw.
 
App. 484, 848 P.2d 383 (1993). Pursuant to the procedures set
 forth in the Administrative Revocation of Driver's License Law,
 Part XIV of HRS Chapter 286 (Repealed 2000), the appellant in
 Danielson had his license administratively revoked for driving
 under the influence. Id. at 486, 848 P.2d at 384. Under HRS §
 
286-260(a) (repealed 2000), "If the director sustains the
 administrative revocation after administrative hearing, the
 arrestee may file a petition for judicial review within thirty
 days after the administrative hearing decision is mailed." Id.
 
at 486, 848 P.2d at 385 (quoting HRS § 286-260(a) (1993)
 (repealed 2000) (emphasis omitted)). Appellant filed a petition
 for judicial review, but the District Court of the First Circuit
 dismissed his appeal as untimely. Id. 
On appeal, appellant argued that his petition was
 
timely because, under District Court Rules of Civil Procedure
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(DCRCP) Rule 6(e), the court should have added two days to the
 
prescribed thirty day time period. Id. at 487, 848 P.2d at 385.
 
When the Danielson court examined the legislative intent behind
 
the Administrative Revocation of Driver's License Law, Part XIV
 of HRS [c]hapter 286, we "found that the legislature desired that
 the driver's license revocation process be 'expeditious,' that
 the law be administered 'property and quickly,' and that 'any
 lengthy delay in the hearing process' is not to be tolerated." 
Id. at 488, 848 P.2d at 385 (citing Aspinwall v. Tanaka, 9 Haw.
 App. 396, 403, 843 P.2d 145, 149 (1992)). The Danielson court
 held that DCRCP Rule 6(e) was not applicable to enlarge the
 thirty-day filing requirement under HRS § 286-260(a) for two
 reasons. First, the legislative history of the law indicated an
 intent that "judicial review of the administrative license
 revocation decision be expeditious and without delay." Second,
 the legislature did not intend that the time period be computed
 in accordance with DCRCP Rule 6 because of "Part XIV's inclusion
 of HRS § 286-266 [(1993) (repealed 2000)] regarding computation
 of time, which is covered in DCRCP Rule 6(a), and Part XIV's non-
inclusion of contents of DCRCP Rule 6(e) in Part XIV." Id. at
 
488, 848 P.2d at 385-86. Without applying the DCRCP's two-day
 mail rule, this court determined that appellant's petition was
 untimely. Id.
 
In the instant case, HPR's rules govern the calculation 
of the time prescribed in HRS § 560:3-806(a). HRS § 560:1-304 (Practice in court), provides that "[u]nless specifically provided to the contrary in this chapter or unless inconsistent with its provisions, the Hawai
'i probate rules govern formal and 
informal proceedings under this chapter." The Uniform Probate Code's process for presenting a claim does not indicate that HPR rules should not apply or that application of HPR rules would be inconsistent with the code's provision. See HRS §§ 560:3-801 et. 
seq (2006 Repl.). Unlike Danielson, the Uniform Probate Code does not include its own provision for how to compute time restraints, further indicating an intent to utilize HPR's rules for computation of time. Compare Uniform Probate Code, HRS 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
chapter 560 with Danielson, 9 Haw. App. at 488, 848 P.2d at 386 
(summarizing Administrative Revocation of Driver's License Law, Part XIV of HRS Chapter 286). Also unlike Danielson, HRS § 560:3-806's legislative history does not indicate that policymakers intended the process for presenting a claim be "expeditious" or administered "properly and quickly." Compare 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 77, in 1996 House Journal, at 991, in 1996 Senate Journal, at 773 (Uniform Probate Code, HRS Chapter 560's legislative history), with Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 137, in 1990 Senate Journal, at 681-82 (statement of Sen. Salling) (Administrative Revocation of Driver's License Law, Part XIV of HRS chapter 286's legislative history). Therefore, much like the court's determination in Rivera, the computation of time pursuant to HRS § 560:3-806(a) is governed by HPR Rule 10, which includes HPR's two day mail rule under HPR Rule 10(d). See Rivera, 100 
Hawai
'i at 350, 60 P.3d at 300. 
HRS § 560:3-806(a) established that the sixty-day 
period in which Ramos may have filed her Petition for claims began to run after the mailing of the disallowance letters. See 
HRS § 560:3-806(a). Therefore, HRS § 560:3-8069(a) triggered HPR Rule 10(d), and two days were added to the prescribed time period, resulting in a sixty-two-day period to file her Petition. See id.; HPR Rule 10(d); Rivera, 100 Hawai
'i 348, 351, 60 P.3d 
298, 301 (holding that "when HRCP Rule 6(e) is triggered . . . HRCP Rule 6(e) is applied instantly to extend the original prescribed period for action by two days") (emphasis omitted)). Ramos, therefore, had a total of sixty-two days to file her Petition with the circuit court. 
Pursuant to HPR Rule 10, the sixty-two-day time limit
 
began to run on August 22, 2013, the day after Respondents mailed
 their disallowance letters. See HPR Rule 10 ("In computing any
 
period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of
 court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event,
 or default after which the designated period of time begins to
 run is not to be included."). The sixty-second day was Tuesday,
 October 22, 2013. Ramos needed to have filed her claim by that
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
date in order to be within the sixty-two-day period. Ramos filed
 
her Petition on October 22, 2013 at 3:43 PM. Ramos' Petition
 was, therefore, timely and the circuit court erred in finding
 that it did not have jurisdiction over Ramos' Petition.

§ 560:3-806(a).
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we vacate the "Order Dismissing With
 
Prejudice Claimant's Petition For Relief And Allowance Of Claims
 Filed October 22, 2013," entered on May 22, 2014 in the Circuit
 of the Third Circuit, and remand this case for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion.
