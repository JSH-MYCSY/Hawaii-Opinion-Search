STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CASEY L. BURNETT, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(HONOLULU DIVISION)

(CASE NO. 1DTA-13-05527)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Casey L. Burnett (Burnett) with operating a
 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or
 (a)(3) (2007).
1/ After a bench trial, Burnett was found guilty
 
as charged. 
1/ HRS § 291E-61(a) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty; [or]
 
. . . 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath[.]

Burnett appeals from the Judgment entered by the 
District Court of the First Circuit (District Court)2/ on June 2, 
2014. Burnett raises nine points of error, which are the same as 
the points of error raised by the defendant in State v. Seidl, No. CAAP-14-0000885, 2016 WL 6879554 (Hawai
'i App. Nov. 22, 2016) 
(SDO). We apply our analysis in Seidl, and we resolve Burnett's points of error in the same way we resolved the corresponding points of error in Seidl. 
In particular, Burnett argues that the District Court
 
erred when it incorporated testimony for his pre-trial
 suppression motions into the trial over his objection. The
 District Court, over Burnett's objection, consolidated Burnett's
 pretrial suppression motions with the trial, heard testimony on
 the suppression motions and trial contemporaneously, and ruled on
 the suppression motions after the parties had rested at trial. 
The State concedes error on this point, and we agree with this
 concession of error. See Seidl, 2016 WL 6879554, at *1-2 (citing 
State v. Doyle, 64 Haw. 229, 638 P.2d 332 (1981), and State v.
 Thomas, 72 Haw. 48, 805 P.2d 1212 (1991)).
 
In addition, we conclude that the District Court erred 
in denying Burnett's motion to suppress on Fourth Amendment grounds the results of his breath test. See Seidl, 2016 WL 
6879554, at *2 (citing State v. Won, 137 Hawai
'i 330, 372 P.3d 
1065 (2015)).3/ 
2/ The Honorable David W. Lo presided.
 
3/ As in Seidl, because we conclude that the District Court should have
suppressed the results of Burnett's breath test on Fourth Amendment grounds,
we need not address Burnett's claim that the District Court erred in denyinghis motion to suppress the breath test results for violation of his right toaccess counsel under HRS § 803-9 (2014). We note, however, that in State v.Scalera, SCWC-14-0001060, 2017 WL 1422682 (Hawai' i Apr. 21, 2017), the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court held that advising Scalera that "[y]ou are not entitled to anattorney before you submit to any tests [sic] or tests to determine youralcohol and/or drug content[,]" as Burnett was advised in this case, violatedScalera's statutory right to access counsel under HRS § 803-9.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the District Court's
 
Judgment, and we remand the case for a new trial that is limited
 
to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII charge.
