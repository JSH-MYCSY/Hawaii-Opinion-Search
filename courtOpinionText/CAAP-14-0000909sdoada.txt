1/ 
which awarded Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of Soundview Home Loan trust 2006-OPT2, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006Â­OPT2, a National Banking Association ("Deutsche Bank") a writ of possession for the property located at 2127 Mokuhau Road in Wailuku, Hawai
'i (the "Property").2/  
Appellants contend that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
(1) granted Deutsche Bank's motion for summary judgment because
 the law of the case doctrine should have precluded the Circuit
 Court from doing so; (2) considered hearsay statements in order
 to determine that Deutsche Bank sufficiently proved that it
 complied with Hawaii Revised Statutes section 667-5; and (3)
 denied Appellants' motion for sanctions.
 
For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand.
 
I. Brief Background 
On February 23, 2006, Garcia executed and delivered to 
The Funding Group, Inc. ("Funding Group") an Adjustable Rate Note ("Note") for the Property. On March 1, 2006, a Mortgage on the Property that was executed by the Appellants was recorded with the State of Hawai
'i Bureau of Conveyances ("Bureau of 
Conveyances"). 
On February 24, 2006, Funding Group assigned the
 
Mortgage to Option One Mortgage Corporation ("Option One"). 
Option One recorded the Assignment of Mortgage in the Bureau of
 Conveyances on July 5, 2006. On May 5, 2009, Sand Canyon
 Corporation, fka Option One ("Sand Canyon") assigned the Mortgage
 to Deutsche Bank, who duly recorded an Assignment of Mortgage in
 
1/
 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
 
2/
 The Property is also known as 385 Lakee Place, Wailuku, Hawai' i 
96793.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Bureau of Conveyances on May 20, 2009. 
Deutsche Bank executed a Notice of Mortgagee's
 
Intention to Foreclose Under Power of Sale ("Foreclosure Notice")
 
on May 19, 2009, and recorded it in the Bureau of Conveyances on
 May 20, 2009. The Foreclosure Notice stated that the foreclosure
 sale was scheduled for July 22, 2009. 
Deutsche Bank postponed the foreclosure sale until
 
January 4, 2010. On January 4, 2010, Deutsche Bank proceeded
 with the foreclosure sale, and with no other bidders, purchased
 the Property with a credit bid of $295,200.00. On January 14,
 2010, Deutsche Bank recorded the Mortgagee's Affidavit of
 Foreclosure Under Power of Sale ("Affidavit of Foreclosure") in
 the Bureau of Conveyances. The Affidavit of Foreclosure states,
 among other things, that the Property was sold to Deutsche Bank
 for $295,200.00, which was the highest bid at the sale. On March
 23, 2010, Deutsche Bank recorded a Mortgage's Quitclaim Deed
 Pursuant to Power of Sale with the Bureau of Conveyances which
 was executed on January 4, 2010 and which conveyed the Property
 from Deutsche Bank, as the foreclosing mortgagee, to Deutsche
 Bank, as the purchaser at the non-judicial foreclosure auction. 
On May 13, 2011, Deutsche Bank filed a Complaint for
 
Ejectment against the Appellants in Circuit Court. On April 5,
 2012, Deutsche Bank filed its motion for summary judgment and
 writ of possession. On July 12, 2012, Appellants served Deutsche
 Bank with their first request for production of documents. On
 November 14, 2012, Appellants filed Defendants' Motion (1) to
 Compel Plaintiff to Produce Documents and Answer Interrogatories
 and (2) for Attorney's Fees and Costs ("Motion to Compel") 
On December 17, 2012, the Circuit Court entered an
 
Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of
 Possession, an Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for a Protective
 Order as to Defendants' First Request for Answers to
 Interrogatories to Plaintiff and Defendants' First Request for
 Production of Documents, and an Order Granting in Part and
 Denying in Part Defendants' Motion (1) to Compel Plaintiff to
 Produce Documents and Answer Interrogatories and (2) for
 Attorney's Fees and Costs ("Order Compelling Discovery").

On January 17, 2013, Deutsche Bank submitted the
 
Affidavit of Douglas Sameshima ("Sameshima Affidavit") to the
 
Circuit Court. 
On April 16, 2013, Deutsche Bank filed another motion
 
for summary judgment and writ of possession. On September 3,
 2013, Appellants filed Defendants' Motion for Sanctions for
 Failure to Comply with an Order Compelling Discovery ("Motion for
 Sanctions"). On April 15, 2014, the Circuit Court issued the
 Order Denying Sanctions, Order Granting Summary Judgment, the
 Writ, and the Judgment. 
II. Discussion
 
A. Summary Judgment
 Appellants contend that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
granted summary judgment because Deutsche Bank did not meet its
 initial burden to produce evidence regarding its prima facie
 case. 
We review the Circuit Court's grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo. Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 
136 Hawai
'i 227, 240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015). "[S]ummary 
judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id. (quoting Price v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 
107 Hawai
'i 106, 110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005)). "The moving party 
has the initial burden of 'demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.'" Id. (quoting Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. 
v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai
'i 277, 301, 172 P.3d 
1021, 1045 (2007)). Only if the initial showing is satisfied, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to provide "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 
241, 361 P.3d at 468 (quoting Young v. Planning Comm'n of Cty. of Kauai, 89 Hawai
'i 400, 407, 974 P.2d 40, 47 (1999)). 
To maintain an ejectment action in court, the plaintiff
 
must (1) "'prove that [he or she] owns the parcel[] in issue,'
 meaning that he or she must have 'the title to and right of
 possession of' such parcel"; and (2) "establish that 'possession

is unlawfully withheld by another.'" Id. (citations omitted). 
In Kondaur, the supreme court concluded that the only evidence 
produced by plaintiff with respect to the sale - an affidavit of sale prepared by their predecessor-in-interest's attorney - was insufficient under Ulrich v. Security Investment Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Terr. 1939), which requires a showing that the foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and that an adequate price was procured for the property. 136 Hawai
'i at 242-44, 361 P.3d at 469-471. As a 
result, because Kondaur never met its initial burden of showing that the foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, in good faith, and would obtain an adequate price for the property, the burden of summary judgment never shifted to the mortgagor to raise any genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 243, 361 P.3d at 470. 
Kondaur is dispositive in the instant case. Here, 
Deutsche Bank was the foreclosing mortgagee and the purchasing highest bidder at the non-judicial foreclosure sale. Thus, pursuant to Kondaur and Ulrich, Deutsche Bank had the initial burden to establish that the non-judicial foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, in good faith, and that an adequate price was procured for the Property. See JP Morgan Chase Bank, Nat'l Ass'n v. Benner, 137 Hawai
'i 326, 
372 P.3d 358 (App. 2016). 
The Affidavit of Foreclosure, and the Sameshima 
Affidavit, prepared by Deutsche Bank's attorney, were the only documents submitted to show the manner in which the sale was conducted. Similar to the circumstances in Kondaur, Deutsche Bank did not make any declaration concerning the adequacy of the Property's purchase price. Therefore, as in Kondaur, Deutsche Bank did not satisfy its initial burden of showing that the foreclosure sale was conducted in a manner that was fair, reasonably diligent, in good faith, and would obtain an adequate price for the Property. In addition, as Appellants argue, the Sameshima Affidavit fails to comply with Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 56(e).

Because Deutsche Bank did not satisfy its initial
 
burden for summary judgment, the burden never shifted to
 
Appellants to raise a genuine issue of material fact. The grant
 of summary judgment in favor of Deutsche Bank was in error. 
B. Motion for Sanctions
 Appellants also contend that the Circuit Court erred 
when it denied their Motion for Sanctions. However, we conclude that Appellants fail to show that the Circuit Court abused its discretion. Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 299, 75 P.3d 1180, 
1190 (2003) ("The imposition of a sanction is generally within the discretion of the trial court.") 
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
Order Denying Sanctions, vacate the Judgment, and the order
 
granting summary judgment, and remand the case for further
 proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
