APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2190-08)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Plaintiff-Appellee's Statement
 
Contesting Jurisdiction, and the record on appeal, it appears
 
that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant/Cross-Claim
 Plaintiff/Appellant Aurora C. Mariani, M.D.'s (Dr. Mariani),
 appeal from the Honorable Karen T. Nakasone's May 15, 2014 "Order
 Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of Order Granting
 Defendant Aurora C. Mariani, M.D.'s Motion to Dismiss Complaint
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Filed August 16, 2012, Filed on October 17, 2013, Filed on 
December 26, 2013, Filed on 1/23/14" (hereinafter the May 15, 2014 interlocutory order). We conclude that Dr. Mariani's appeal is untimely because she did not file her July 2, 2014 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the May 15, 2014 interlocutory order, as Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) required for a timely appeal. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) authorizes 
appeals to the Hawai 'i Intermediate Court of Appeals from final 
judgments, orders, or decrees. No final judgment, order, or decree has been entered by the circuit court in this case. 
Dr. Mariani has attempted to assert an interlocutory
 
appeal from the May 15, 2014 interlocutory order pursuant to HRS
 § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2013), which provides:
 
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
 allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
 
The circuit court granted Dr. Mariani permission by way of the
 
circuit court's June 27, 2014 order granting Appellant
 Dr. Mariani's May 21, 2014 motion for permission to assert an
 interlocutory appeal from the May 15, 2014 interlocutory order.
 
Nevertheless, "[w]hen a civil appeal is permitted by 
law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has interpreted the combination of 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) and HRS § 641-1(b) as follows: 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We have interpreted HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)'s requirement that the
notice of interlocutory appeal be filed "within 30 days
after the date of entry of the . . . . order appealed from"
to mean that . . . [i]t is necessary for a party wanting to
 take an interlocutory appeal to move for an order allowing
the appeal, for the court to enter the order and for the
appellant to file the notice of appeal all within 30 days
from the filing of the order appealed from, unless the time
for appeal is extended pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(5).
 
State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai 'i 404, 406, 967 P.2d 236, 238 (1998) 
(some emphasis added; citation and block quotation format 
omitted). "The order appealed from on an interlocutory appeal is not made final, for any purpose, by the allowance of the interlocutory appeal and the time period runs from the entry of the order, not from the allowance of the appeal." King v. 
Wholesale Produce Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 335, 741 P.2d 721, 722 (1987) (emphasis added).
1 Thus, for example, we 
held that we did not have jurisdiction over an appeal from an interlocutory order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) when "the court did not enter its written order allowing an interlocutory appeal within thirty days of the entry of the order from which Plaintiffs wished to appeal, despite Plaintiffs' prompt motion for such an order." Kohala Agriculture v. Deloitte & Touche, 86 
Hawai
'i 301, 311, 9494 P.2d 141, 151 (App. 1997) ("Therefore, we 
conclude that Plaintiffs' appeal of the [interlocutory] order was untimely and we are without jurisdiction of that appeal.").

 With respect to certification of a circuit court's adjudication of
one or more but less than all claims for an appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule
54(b), the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has stated that Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994) overruled King v.
Wholesale Produce Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 741 P.2d 721 (1987).Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239
(1994). However, the holding in Jenkins "does not appear to disturb theholding in King with respect to HRS § 641-1(b)." Kohala Agriculture v.
Deloitte & Touche, 86 Hawai' i 301, 311 n.19, 9494 P.2d 141, 151 n.19 (App.
1997)
.

In the instant case, Dr. Mariani did not file her 
July 2, 2014 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of
 
the May 15, 2014 interlocutory order, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)
 required for a timely appeal. Therefore, Dr. Mariani's appeal
 from the May 15, 2014 interlocutory order is untimely under HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The
 reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a
 default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules,
 except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0000919 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
