Plaintiff/Appellant Dirk Apao (Dirk) as Co-Personal
 
Representative of the Estate of Rose Marie Alvaro (Estate),

in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court):
 
(1)
 "Garnishee Order as to Garnishee Title Guaranty
 
Escrow Services, Inc." (Garnishment Order), entered on June 19,
 
2014; and
 
(2) "Order Denying Defendant/Counterclaim

 Filed on April 21, 2014" (Order Denying Motion to Quash), entered
 
on June 19, 2014.
 
On appeal, Appellants contend the circuit court did not
 
have jurisdiction to garnish funds held by Garnishee-Appellee

"distribution of the assets of the Estate is subject to the

I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 7, 2011, the Plaintiffs/Counterclaim­
Defendants/Appellees Gerald K. Mount, Jr. and Jane R. Mount
 (together, Mounts) filed a Complaint for ejectment and quiet
 
title for the Estate's property (Property) against Appellants.
 
The Mounts' Complaint alleged:
 
COUNT I
 
(EJECTMENT)
 
. . . .
 
13. [Margaret] and/or [the Estate] have unlawfully
entered and remain upon the Property and, without right or
authority of law, ousted [the Mounts] therefrom.
 
14. [Margaret] and/or [the Estate] are in possession
of the Property and have withheld and continue to withhold
possession of the Property from [the Mounts].
 
15. By reason of [Margaret] and/or [the Estate's]
unlawful withholding of the Property, [the Mounts] have been
deprived of the rents and profits thereof since on or about
May 19, 2011, and unless relief is granted, will continue to
be so deprived, to [the Mounts'] damage.

 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
16. By virtue of [the Apaos'] wrongful possession [the
Mounts] should be awarded possession of the premises,
including a Writ of Possession and a Writ of Eviction and/or
Ejectment, and an award of reasonable attorneys fees and
costs incurred in this action.
 
COUNT II
 
(QUIET TITLE)
 
. . . .
 
18. [The Mounts], as rightful holders of the recorded
Deed to the Property, herein seeks a final and binding
determination of [the Apaos] alleged adverse claims of an
interest in the Property, pursuant to Hawaii Revised
Statutes [(HRS) § 669-1(a) (1993)].
 
The Mounts sought a writ of possession and an award of money
 
damages.
 
On July 25, 2013, the circuit court entered a writ of
 
possession in favor of the Mounts and against Appellants. On
 October 10, 2013, the circuit court entered the "Order Granting
 [the Mounts'] Motion for Award of Damages (Count 1 - Ejectment),"
 awarding the Mounts $201,759.68 in damages. On November 4, 2013,
 the circuit court entered the "Order Granting [the Mounts']
 Request for Attorneys' Fees and Costs," awarding the Mounts
 attorneys' fees and costs. On February 20, 2014, the circuit
 court entered the "Order Granting [the Mounts'] Motion for Award
 of Supplemental Damages for Ejectment and for Entry of Final
 Judgment," awarding the Mounts $35,745.13 in additional damages
 for a total award of $237,504.81 in damages against Dirk and
 Margaret.
 
On March 13, 2014, the circuit court entered the Final
 
Judgment, awarding damages in the amount of $237,504.81 and legal
 fees and costs in the amount of $208,592.23, in favor of the
 Mounts and against Dirk, as co-personal representative of the
 Estate, and Margaret (Money Judgment).
 
On April 3, 2014, the Mounts moved for a post-judgment
 
order seeking garnishment of the funds from Title Guaranty, who
 was in possession of some of the Estate's funds (Garnishee
 
Summons). That same day, the circuit court issued the "Order for
 
Issuance of Garnishee Summons" to Title Guaranty.
 
On April 21, 2014, Dirk filed a motion to quash (Motion
 
to Quash) the Mounts' Garnishee Summons. On April 22, 2014,
 Title Guaranty filed a garnishee disclosure, indicating it held
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$34,301.96 in surplus funds in proceeds from the foreclosure sale
 
of the Property to the Mounts. Title Guaranty disclosed that it
 "attempted to disburse the surplus funds to [Dirk], Co-Personal
 Representative of the [Estate,] but Mr. Gary Victor Dubin,
 counsel for [Dirk] refused such payout to the Estate."
 
On May 20, 2014, the Mounts filed their opposition to
 
Dirk's Motion to Quash. On May 28, 2014, the circuit court held
 a hearing on Dirk's Motion to Quash and the Mounts' Garnishee
 Summons.
 
On June 19, 2014, the circuit court entered the Order
Denying Motion to Quash and Garnishment Order. The Garnishment
 Order required Title Guaranty to pay the Mounts "the sum of
 $33,926.96 for a total amount that it has in its possession
 belonging to [Dirk]."
 
 
On July 3, 2014, Dirk filed a notice of appeal from the
 
circuit court's Order Denying Motion to Quash and Garnishment
 Order.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Jurisdiction
 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that [the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong standard." Captain Andy's Sailing, Inc., v. Dep't of Land and 
Natural Resources, 113 Hawai
'i 184, 192, 150 P.3d 833, 841 (2006) 
(citation, internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted).
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
The standard of review for statutory construction is
well-established. The interpretation of a statute is
a question of law which [the appellate] court reviews
de novo. Where the language of the statute is plain
and unambiguous, our only duty is to give effect to
its plain and obvious meaning.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Jurisdiction
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Appellants contend the circuit court erred in
 
garnishing Estate funds from Title Guaranty to partially satisfy
 
the Mounts' Money Judgment because "the Probate Court has
 exclusive jurisdiction over all unsecured claims asserted by
 creditors of the Estate in the pending formal probate
 proceedings."
 
In general, the rights of creditors to a decedent's 
property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in Hawai
'i's Uniform Probate Code.2 HRS § 560:3-101 
(2006 Repl.) ("The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to the decedent's property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this chapter to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates."). Contrary to Appellants' contention, however, the statute does not grant the probate court exclusive jurisdiction over creditors' claims. HRS § 560:3-804(2) (2006 Repl.) specifically provides "[t]he claimant may commence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of the claimant's claim
[3] against the estate, but 
the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim." (Emphasis added.) Similarly, this court held in Labayog v. Labayog, 83 Hawai
'i 412, 433, 927 
P.2d 420, 441 (App. 1996), that a claim brought pursuant to HRS § 560:3-804(2) "can be presented in a proceeding other than the

 Hawai'i's legislature adopted the Uniform Probate Code (2006
Repl.) in 1996 with the belief that it would "significantly reduce the time,
complexity, and expense of probate proceedings." Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 77, in1996 House Journal, at 991, Senate Journal, at 773.

 Hawai'i's Uniform Probate Code defines "Claims" as follows: 
"Claims", in respect to estates of decedents and
protected persons, includes liabilities of the decedent or
protected person, whether arising in contract, in tort, or
otherwise, and liabilities of the estate which arise at or
after the death of the decedent or after the appointment of
a conservator, including funeral expenses and expenses of
administration. The term does not include estate or
 inheritance taxes, or demands or disputes regarding title of
a decedent or protected person to specific assets alleged to
be included in the estate.
 
HRS § 560:1-201 (2006 Repl.).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4The record does not indicate that the circuit court determined
whether the Mounts successfully presented a claim against the Estate, pursuant
to HRS §§ 560:3-803 (2006 Repl.) and -804.  HRS § 560:3-803, provides in
relevant part:
§560:3-803 Limitations on presentation of claims.  
(a) All claims against either a decedent or a decedent's
estate which arose before the death of the decedent,
including claims of the State and any subdivision thereof,
whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort, or
other legal basis, if not barred earlier by another statute
of limitations or non-claim statute, are barred against the
estate, the personal representative, the decedent's trustee
and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented
within the earlier of the following:
. . . .
(2)Within eighteen months after the
decedent's death, if notice to creditors
has not been published as provided in
section 560:3-801(a) or delivered as
provided in section 560:3-801(b).
. . . .
(c)
 All claims against a decedent's estate which arise
at or after the death of the decedent, including claims of
the State and any subdivision thereof, whether due or to
become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, founded on contract, tort, or other legal
basis, are barred against the estate, the personal
representative, the decedent's trustee, and the heirs and
devisees of the decedent, unless presented as follows:
(1)A claim based on a contract with the personal
representative or trustee, within four months
after performance by the personal representative
or trustee is due; or
(2)Any other claim, within the later of four months
after it arises, or the time specified in
subsection (a)(2).
HRS § 560:3-804 provides, in relevant part:
§560:3-804 Manner of presentation of claims.  Claims
against a decedent's estate may be presented as follows:
(1)The claimant may deliver or mail to the personal
representative a written statement of the claim
indicating its basis, the name and address of
the claimant, and the amount claimed, or may
file a written statement of the claim, in the
form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the
court.
6probate case and in a court other than the circuit court acting
in probate."  Therefore, assuming the Mounts sufficiently
presented a claim for payment,4 Appellants' contention that the
probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over the Mounts' claim FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is without merit. 
B. HRS §§ 560:3-805 (2006 Repl.) and 560:3-812 (2006 Repl.)
 
While we disagree with Appellants' claim that the
 
probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the Mounts' claim,

 
we agree with Appellants' contention that the circuit court and
 the Mounts were bound to the procedures for satisfaction of
 claims against the Estate as set forth in HRS §§ 560:3-801 et.
 
5
seq. Citing HRS § 560:3-105 (2006 Repl.),  Appellants argue on
appeal that the circuit court erred in garnishing the Estate's
 assets because the Mounts' claim was "subject to the rights and
 priorities of other creditors of the Estate in the pending formal
 probate action[.]"
 
HRS § 560:3-805 establishes a list of priorities for
 
how payment of claims against an estate should be made when the

 
assets of the estate are insufficient to satisfy all claims, and
 provides in relevant part: 
§560:3-805 Classification of claims. (a) If the
applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all
claims in full, the personal representative shall make
payment in the following order:
 
(1)	 Costs and expenses of administration;
 
(2)	 Reasonable funeral expenses including any claim by the
department of human services pursuant to section
346-15;
 
(3)	 Debts and taxes with preference under federal law;
 
(4)	 Reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses
of the last illness of the decedent, including
compensation of persons attending the decedent and any
claim by the department of human services pursuant to
section 346-37 for expenses of the last illness of the
decedent;
 
(5)	 Debts and taxes with preference under other laws of
 
5
 HRS § 560:3-105 provides in relevant part:
 
§560:3-105 Proceedings affecting devolution and
administration; jurisdictions of subject matter. . . . The
 court has exclusive jurisdiction of formal proceedings to
determine how decedents' estates, subject to the laws of
this State, are to be administered, expended, and
distributed. The court has concurrent jurisdiction of any
other action or proceeding concerning a succession or to
which an estate, through a personal representative, may be a
party, including actions to determine title to property
alleged to belong to the estate, and of any action or
proceeding in which property distributed by a personal
representative or its value is sought to be subjected to
rights of creditors or successors of the decedent.

this State;
 
(6)	 Any other claim against the estate pursuant to section
346-37; and
 
(7)	 All other claims.
 
Payment of claims are to be made pursuant to HRS § 560:3-807
 
(2006 Repl.).6 Furthermore, HRS § 560:3-812 specifically
 
provides that "[n]o execution may issue upon nor may any levy be
 made against any property of the estate under any judgment 
against a decedent or a personal representative[.]"

 HRS §560:3-807 provides:
 
§560:3-807 Payment of claims.  (a) Upon the
expiration of the earlier of the time limitations provided
in section 560:3-803 for the presentation of claims, the
personal representative shall proceed to pay the claims
allowed against the estate in the order of priority
prescribed, after making provision for homestead, family and
support allowances, for claims already presented that have
not yet been allowed or whose allowance has been appealed,
and for unbarred claims that may yet be presented, including
costs and expenses of administration. By petition to the
court in a proceeding for the purpose, or by appropriate
motion if the administration is supervised, a claimant whose
claim has been allowed but not paid may secure an order
directing the personal representative to pay the claim to
the extent funds of the estate are available to pay it.
 (b) The personal representative at any time may pay
any just claim that has not been barred, with or without
formal presentation, but is personally liable to any other
claimant whose claim is allowed and who is injured by its
payment if:
 (1) 	 Payment was made before the expiration of the
time limit stated in subsection (a) and the
personal representative failed to require the
payee to give adequate security for the refund
of any of the payment necessary to pay other
claimants; or
 (2) 	 Payment was made, due to negligence or wilful
fault of the personal representative, in such
manner as to deprive the injured claimant of
priority.

 HRS 560:3-812 provides:
 
§560:3-812. Execution and levies prohibited.  
No execution may issue upon nor may any levy be made
against any property of the estate under any judgment
against a decedent or a personal representative, but
this section shall not be construed to prevent the
enforcement of mortgages, pledges or liens upon real
or personal property in an appropriate proceeding.

was a separate action from U.S. Bank National Association's foreclosure of the

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
execution is a "[p]rocess to enforce a judgment for the payment
 
of money . . . ." HRCP Rule 69.
 
Hawai'i appellate courts have yet to determine whether 
the prohibition against executions under HRS § 560:3-812 applies to garnishments. "A garnishment 'is an incident to or an auxiliary of judgment rendered in principal action, and is resorted to as a means of obtaining satisfaction of judgment by reaching credits or property of judgment debtor.'" Int'l Sav. & 
Loan Ass'n v. Wiig, 82 Hawai
'i 197, 202, 921 P.2d 117, 122 (1996) 
(citing Black's Law Dictionary 680 (6th ed. 1990)). Like a writ of execution, "[t]he primary purpose of a garnishment is to enforce the payment of a judgment." Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 82 
Hawai
'i at 202, 921 P.2d at 122 (citing First Nat. Bank in 
Chester v. Conner, 485 S.W.2d 667, 671 (Mo. Ct. App. 1972) ("[A] 'garnishment' is an ancillary remedy in aid of execution to obtain payment of a judgment.")). Thus, similar to the policy reasons for disallowing courts from issuing a writ of execution over property in decedent's estate, allowing a creditor to obtain satisfaction of a judgment through garnishment of an estate's assets would obviate the classification of claims, as set forth in HRS § 560:3-805, and would undermine the prohibition against executions as provided in HRS § 560:3-812. See Prof'l Disc. 
Corp. v. Fulton Nat. Bank of Atlanta, 156 S.E.2d 80, 82 (Ga. 1967) ("[T]o permit a judgment creditor to proceed to collect its judgment by garnishment, during the time permitted by law for the executor to marshal the assets of the estate and determine the claims against the estate, would be to vitiate the priority set forth in such Code section."); see also Lundgren v. Gaudiane, 782 P.2d 285, 288 (Alaska 1989) (holding that entry of a judgment against an estate's assets does not remove the property from the estate and that "[i]t suffices to say that if mere entry of a judgment rendered funds no longer 'property of the estate,' [Alaska statute,] AS 13.16.505, which prohibits execution or levy against 'property of the estate,' would serve no purpose."); In 
7(...continued)
Property, the exception provided for under HRS § 560:3-812 for "enforcement of
mortgages, pledges or liens upon real or personal property" does not apply.
See id.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
re Estate of Rosenberger, 495 N.W.2d 234, 236 (Minn. Ct. App.
 
1993) ("Just as attachment freezes the status quo in order for
 underlying claims to be sorted out, the probate code freezes the
 status quo (except for the payment of maintenance) by prohibiting
 executions of attachments.").
 
Interpreting HRS § 560:3-812 to prohibit the circuit 
court from issuing executions, but not garnishments, would result in an absurd and unjust result. See Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 131 
Hawai
'i 497, 508, 319 P.3d 416, 427 (2014) ("[D]eparture from the 
literal construction of a statute is justified if such a construction yields an absurd and unjust result obviously inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the statute." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, we interpret HRS § 560-812 as prohibiting the circuit court from ordering garnishment of an estate's funds to satisfy a judgment against the decedent or the personal representative of the estate that is in probate. 
In the case at issue, the record indicates that on
 
September 7, 2011, the Mounts filed their Complaint for ejectment

 
and quiet title against Appellants, which culminated in the Money
 Judgment issued March 13, 2014 in favor of the Mounts and against
 both Dirk, as co-personal representative of the Estate, and
 Margaret for $237,504.81 in damages and $208,592.23 in legal fees
 and costs. On June 19, 2014, while the Estate was still

 undergoing formal probate proceedings, the circuit court issued 
its Garnishment Order, requiring Title Guaranty to pay the Mounts
 $33,926.96, which were the Estate's funds being held in escrow

 The Estate probate proceedings were not made a part of the record
on appeal in the instant case. "While matters not properly presented to the
trial court may not ordinarily be considered by the appellate court on appeal,an appellate court may, in its discretion, take judicial notice of files orrecords of a case on appeal." Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai' i 91, 110 n.9, 969
P.2d 1209, 1228 n.9 (1998) (citation, internal quotation marks and bracketsomitted). "Courts have generally recognized that they may, in appropriatecircumstances, take notice of proceedings in other courts, both within andwithout their judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation tothe matter at issue." Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Sapp v. Wong, 3 Haw.
App. 509, 512 n.3, 654 P.2d 883, 885–86 n.3 (1982)). We take judicial noticeof the Estate's probate proceedings in 1LP03-1-000018. Based on the document list from the Estate's probate proceedings, on January 14, 2003, the Estatewent into informal probate and, on July 11, 2007, the proceedings weretransferred to a formal proceeding.
