 We note that Uponor, Inc. requests that we take judicial notice of a
nationwide class action settlement that Uponor, Inc. contends supports its res
 
judicata argument. However, we decline to take judicial notice of the class
action settlement as it was not raised to the Circuit Court of the Fifth
 
Circuit. Moreover, it remains unclear how the class action settlement affects
the claims in this case. Uponor, Inc. may raise the class action settlement
in the circuit court on remand.
