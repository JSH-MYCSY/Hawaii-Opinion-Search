IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRISTINE MARIE BICKEL and NEAL H. GRAY,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-2355-10)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Christine Marie Bickel (Bickel) 
obtained a loan from Plaintiff-Appellee JPMorgan Chase Bank,
 
National Association (Chase) in the principal amount of
 $204,000.00, as evidenced by a promissory note (Note) dated
 August 4, 2005. To secure payment of the Note, Bickel and Neal
 H. Gary (Gary) executed a mortgage (Mortgage) in favor of Chase, which encumbered real property located in Captain Cook, Hawai
'i 
(Subject Property) and was recorded on August 22, 2005, in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawai
'i (Bureau of 
Conveyances). 
When Bickel failed to make scheduled payments under the

 
Note and Mortgage, Chase accelerated the loan and initiated
 foreclosure proceedings against Bickel and Gary in the Circuit

Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).1 On June 12, 2014,
 
the Circuit Court entered its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
Law, Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Default and/or Summary
 Judgment Against All Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure Filed January 5, 2014" (Foreclosure Order). Pursuant
 to the Foreclosure Order, the Circuit Court also filed its
 "Judgment" on June 12, 2014 (Foreclosure Judgment), which entered
 summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure in favor
 of Chase and against Bickel and Gary. Bickel filed a notice of
 appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment.

A foreclosure sale of the Subject Property did not take
 
place. On May 29, 2015, after the filing of this appeal, Bickel
 entered into a "Loan Modification Agreement" with Seterus, Inc.,
 the loan servicer for Federal National Mortgage Association
 (FNMA), Chase's successor in interest.
3 The Loan Modification
 
Agreement was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on August 10,
 2015. The Loan Modification Agreement "amends and supplements"
 the original Note and Mortgage. 
In its answering brief, Chase states that the Loan
 
Modification Agreement "effectively cured" Bickel's default under
 the original Note and Mortgage and that Bickel "has performed and
 is current under the [Loan Modification Agreement]." As a result
 of Bickel's entry into the Loan Modification Agreement, her
 default under the terms of the original Note and Mortgage is no
 longer actionable, and any future default and foreclosure
 proceedings would be governed by, and require Bickel's violation

2Gary did not appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment and
transferred all his interest in the Subject Property to Bickel
pursuant to a Quitclaim Deed recorded in the Bureau of
Conveyances on June 30, 2014.
 
3Chase assigned its interest in the Mortgage to FNMA
pursuant to a "Hawaii Assignment of Mortgage" recorded in the
Bureau of Conveyances on June 12, 2014.

of, the terms of the Loan Modification Agreement.4 Accordingly, 
Bickel's appeal of the Foreclosure Judgment does not constitute 
"a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law[,]" and her appeal does not present questions to be determined that "rest on existing facts or rights." Queen Emma

4Chase represents in its brief that Chase and FNMA plan to
file a motion in the Circuit Court to substitute FNMA as a party
in place of Chase and that FNMA thereafter "intends to file a
Motion to: (1) set aside the [Foreclosure Order and Foreclosure
Judgment]; and (2) Dismiss the Foreclosure Action" on the basis
that "the Loan Modification Agreement has rendered the
foreclosure action moot."
