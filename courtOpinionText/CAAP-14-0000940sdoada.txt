IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ELIZABETH C. HOPKINS, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MACY'S WEST STORES, INC., Defendant-Appellee,
and DOES 1-10, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-0275-01 KTN)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Elizabeth C. Hopkins (Hopkins)
 
appeals from the Order Granting Defendant Macy's West Stores,
 
Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Lawsuit (Order
 
Compelling Arbitration), entered on June 18, 2014, in the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, Hopkins raises two points of error,
 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in compelling arbitration
 
and in finding that an arbitration agreement existed between
 Hopkins and her former employer, Defendant-Appellee Macy's West
 Stores, Inc. (Macy's West).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Hopkins's points of error as follows:

 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.

It is undisputed that Hopkins's claims are employment
 
related, that her claims fall within the scope of the subject
 
arbitration agreement, and that she is a party to that agreement. 
Hopkins argues, however, that Macy's West is not entitled to
 enforce the arbitration agreement because Macy's West is a
 subsidiary of Macy's Retail Holding, Inc. (Macy's Retail), rather
 
than Macy's, Inc. It is also undisputed that Macy's West is a
 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Macy's Retail, which is a wholly-owned
 subsidiary of Macy's, Inc., which was formerly named Federated
 Department Stores, Inc. 
We conclude that Hopkins's argument is without merit. 
The subject arbitration agreement expressly provides, inter alia,
 that "Federated" "means any division or subsidiary or operating
 unit or entity related to Federated Department Stores, Inc.,"
 i.e., Macy's, Inc. In light of the express language of the
 agreement to arbitrate, as well as all of the supporting
 circumstances, information, and documents provided to Hopkins in
 conjunction with her agreement to arbitrate all employment-
related disputes, including an option to opt out of arbitration
 which she did not exercise, we reject Hopkins's narrow
 construction that excludes Macy's West because it is a second-
tier subsidiary, rather than a direct subsidiary. See, e.g.,
 
AT&T Techs., Inc. v. Commc'ns Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643, 650
 
2
(1986) (under the Federal Arbitration Act,  state and federal 
courts may not deny arbitration "unless it may be said with
 positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible
 of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute").
 
2
 The subject arbitration agreement includes an express provision
that the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
