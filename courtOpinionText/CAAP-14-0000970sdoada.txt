APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-1890)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Jesus Torres and Mila Torres
 
(together, Appellants), doing business as Hawaiian Quilt
 
Wholesale, appeal the "Order Granting Plaintiff RT Import's
 
Motion for an Order to Confirm Final Award of Arbitrator Dated
 April 2, 2014" (Order Confirming Final Award) and "Judgment" 
both entered on July 1, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
Circuit  (circuit court). 
On appeal, Appellants contend the circuit court erred
 
when it granted the May 20, 2014 "Motion For an Order to Confirm
 
Final Award of Arbitrator Dated April 2, 2014" (Motion to Confirm
 
Award), submitted by Plaintiff-Appellee RT Import Inc. (RT
 
Import) because (1) the arbitrator administrator abused her
 
discretion when she refused to hear and decide Appellants'

"Motion to Set Aside Final Award of Arbitrator" (Motion to Set
 
Aside); (2) the circuit court erroneously concluded that the case
 
was not a Court-Annexed Arbitration Program case; and (3) the
 
Hawaii Arbitration Rules permit a losing party to appeal the
 arbitration award and demand a trial de novo.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Appellants' appeal is without merit.
 
This appeal arises from a binding arbitration entered 
into through stipulation by Appellants and RT Import. RT Import filed its Complaint in the District Court of the First Circuit. Appellants removed the case to circuit court. Appellants and RT Import, along with their counsel, signed the "Stipulation and Order Re Binding Arbitration," filed on January 16, 2014. Appellants and RT Import stipulated, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 658A, to binding arbitration under the 
auspices of Dispute Prevention and Resolution, Inc. (DPR). 
Appellants and RT Import mutually selected the retired Honorable 
Patrick K.S.L Yim (Judge Yim) of DPR as the Arbitrator. The 
arbitration at issue was never part of the State of Hawai
'i's 
Court-Annexed Arbitration Program. 
The arbitration hearing was conducted at the offices of 
DPR in Honolulu, Hawai 'i. Judge Yim submitted his "Final Award 
of Arbitrator," dated April 2, 2014, in favor of RT Import. On 
April 22, 2014, Appellants submitted the Motion to Set Aside with DPR, not with circuit court. The DPR case manager emailed the parties to inform them that "[p]ursuant to the DPR Arbitration Rules and HRS [chapter] 658A, DPR has no authority to consider or rule on the [Motion to Set Aside]." 
Appellants' points on appeal are resolved as follows: 
(1) when the circuit court heard RT Import's Motion to
 
Confirm Award, Appellants did not raise HRS chapter 658A as a
 basis for challenging the arbitration award;
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) the DPR case manager had no authority to consider
 
or rule on the Appellants' Motion to Set Aside under HRS chapter
 
658A; and
 
(3) this case was never part of the Court-Annexed
 
Arbitration Program or subject to the rules of the program, but
 instead was conducted pursuant to HRS chapter 658A.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 1, 2014 "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff RT Import's Motion for an Order to Confirm
 Final Award of Arbitrator Dated April 2, 2014" and July 1, 2014
 "Judgment" both entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 are affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, October 20, 2016.
