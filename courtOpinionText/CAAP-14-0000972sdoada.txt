Plaintiffs-Appellees Ace Quality Farm Products, LLC, a
 
Hawaii Limited Liability Company (Ace) and Western Sales Trading
 
Company, Inc. (WSTCO), a Guam corporation (together, Appellees)
 
brought suit against Hahn, and Defendant-Appellee 7D Food
 
International, Inc. (7D), a Philippine corporation, for various
 
business tort claims.
 
On appeal, Hahn contends the circuit court erred by:
 
(1) enforcing its "Order Granting [Appellees'] Motion
 
for Sanctions for [Hahn's] Spoliation of Evidence Filed on May
 17, 2011" (Spoliation Order) at trial and issuing a spoliation
 
instruction to the jury;
 
(2) discharging Juror Matthew Zitello (Juror Zitello);
 
(3) denying his February 21 , 2013 "Motion to Vacate
 
and Set Aside Jury Verdict" (Motion to Vacate);
 
(4) trebling damages against him;
 
(5) finding sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict
 
against him; and
 
(6) failing to advise the jury of a prior entry of
 
default judgment against 7D.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Hahn's
 appeal is without merit.
I. Spoliation Order
A. Spoliation of Evidence
 
Hahn contends that "[t]he trial court erred in 
sanctioning [him] for the destruction of emails by instructing 
the jury they must presume [he] tortiously interfered with the contract between WSTCO and 7D, and interfered with prospective economic advantages." Hahn claims that "unlike a few jurisdictions, Hawai
'i has not recognized the tort of spoliation 
of evidence." We disagree. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court "recognize[s] that the 
circuit court has wide-ranging authority to impose sanctions for the spoliation of evidence." Stender v. Vincent, 92 Hawai
'i 355, 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
362, 992 P.2d 50, 57 (2000). The supreme court held that the 
circuit court "has the inherent power to fashion a remedy to cure prejudice suffered by one party as a result of another party's loss or destruction of evidence." Id. (emphasis and ellipsis 
omitted) (quoting Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.), 76 Hawai
'i 494, 507–08, 880 P.2d 169, 182–83 (1994)). Notably, the 
supreme court held that the circuit court may give an adverse inference instruction as an appropriate remedy. See Stender, 92 
Hawai
'i at 362, 992 P.2d at 57 (holding that circuit court's 
adverse inference instruction was a type of spoliation sanction within the court's authority); see also Richardson, 76 Hawai
'i at 
508, 880 P.2d at 183 (holding that "the trial court had the inherent power to provide a remedial jury instruction addressing the loss of the original incident report if it deemed such a measure appropriate.").
B. Rebuttable Presumption
 
On appeal, Hahn also claims that the spoliation
 
sanction's adverse inference instruction, "as enforced by the
 court during trial," "suddenly became absolute" when the circuit
 court failed to permit Hahn to "tell the jury that the emails
 were deleted because they contained his confidential marketing
 information that he did not want to share with
 [Appellees] . . . ."
 
The circuit court found that Hahn destroyed relevant
 
emails between himself and 7D. The circuit court sanctioned Hahn
 and indicated that it would issue an adverse inference
 instruction that Hahn intentionally destroyed relevant evidence.
 The instruction included a rebuttable presumption that the
 destroyed evidence supported a finding that Hahn engaged in
 tortious conduct. During trial, Hahn attempted to testify to the
 reason that he deleted the emails between himself and 7D. The
 circuit court instructed Hahn that he was not to explain why the
 documents were destroyed because "it was already addressed in the
 motion for sanction." The circuit court reiterated that while
 Hahn could provide evidence that he did not tortiously interfere
 with the contract between 7D and WSTCO, he could not "relitigate
 the [circuit court's] ruling with regards to the sanction
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
imposed." Because Hahn's testimony attempted to challenge the 
circuit court's award of sanctions and not rebut the presumption that he destroyed emails supporting a finding that Hahn tortiously interfered, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in preventing Hahn's line of testimony. See Stender, 
92 Hawai
'i at 362, 992 P.2d at 57. 
C. Language of Adverse Inference Instruction
 
Hahn also challenges the language used in the circuit 
court's adverse inference instruction. Specifically, Hahn contends the instruction was erroneous because "it was written in the future tense, i.e., that [Hahn] had 'to bring forth proof,'" and "conveyed to the jury the distinct message that [Hahn] had not yet done so." The record indicates Hahn did not object to the language of the circuit court's adverse inference instruction, even though he was given multiple opportunities to do so. See Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 51(f) 
("No party may assign as error the giving or the refusal to give, or the modification of, an instruction . . . unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection."). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held, 
however, that "even the complete failure to object to a jury instruction does not prevent an appellate court from taking cognizance of the trial court's error if the error is plain and may result in a miscarriage of justice." Montalvo v. Lapez, 77 
Hawai
'i 282, 288, 884 P.2d 345, 351 (1994) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). We fail to see how the tense of the court's instruction could have "confused" or "baffled" the jury, as Hahn suggests, so as to constitute plain error. Therefore, we deem Hahn's objection to the instruction waived. See HRCP Rule 
51(f).
II. Dismissal of Juror
 
Hahn contends the circuit court erred when it dismissed
 
Juror Zitello for texting during trial because "[t]he texting
 
allegation did not warrant the ultimate sanction of [Juror
 Zitello's] discharge from the panel."
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 47(e) provides that "[t]he court may for good 
cause excuse a juror from service during trial or deliberation." 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court, in Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai 'i 144, 44 P.3d 
1085 (2002) noted that 
[t]he term "good cause" has been defined to mean "a
substantial reason amounting in law to a legal excuse for
failing to perform an act required by law." Black's Law
Dictionary [at 692]. "Good cause" also "depends upon the
circumstances of the individual case, and a finding of its
existence lies largely in the discretion of the officer or
court to which [the] decision is committed."
 
Doe, 98 Hawai 'i at 154, 44 P.3d at 1095 (quoting Miller v. 
Tanaka, 80 Hawai 'i 358, 910 P.2d 129, reconsideration granted, 80 
Hawai'i 358, 910 P.2d 129, reconsideration denied, 80 Hawai 'i 358, 
910 P.2d 129 (App. 1995), cert. denied, 80 Hawai 'i 357, 910 P.2d 
128 (1996)). The supreme court opined that "[a]s a general rule, 
'good cause' means a substantial reason; one that affords a legal excuse[.]" Doe, 98 Hawai
'i at 154, 44 P.3d at 1095 (quoting 
State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 267, 625 P.2d 1040, 1042–43 (1981)). The supreme court ultimately held that "'good cause' is 
a relative and highly abstract term, and its meaning must be determined not only by verbal context of the statute in which the term is employed, but also by context of action and procedures involved in the type of case presented." Doe, 98 Hawai
'i at 154, 
44 P.3d at 1095 (brackets omitted). 
Here Juror Zitello was dismissed for texting on his
 
cell phone during trial after being instructed not to do so. 
Hahn contends that "the dismissal of [Juror Zitello] in these
 circumstances was an obvious ploy by [Appellees] to get rid of an
 obstacle to their obtaining an award against [Hahn], and
 constituted a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court." A
 review of the record, however, indicates that the circuit court
 expressed its inclination to dismiss Juror Zitello before asking
 the parties to share their positions on the matter. The circuit
 court found that Juror Zitello's actions were "in direct
 contravention to what the [circuit court] had ordered all the
 jurors" and that, "albeit Mr. Zitello did say he did it when you
 were up there on the bench conference[,] that is still not
 justification for him to disregard the [circuit court's] order
 earlier . . . ." Given the context of the situation, the circuit
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was good 
cause to dismiss Juror Zitello. See Doe, 98 Hawai 'i at 154, 44 
P.3d at 1095. 
III. Motion to Vacate
 
Hahn contends the circuit court erred in denying his
 
Motion to Vacate because he had a right to a non-jury trial. In
 
his motion, Hahn sought "a vacatur to remedy the grave injustice
 and illegality that occurred by improperly submitting this case
 for a jury trial."
 
HRCP Rule 39(c) provides:
 
Rule 39. TRIAL BY JURY OR BY THE COURT.
 
. . . .
 
(c) Advisory Jury and Trial by Consent. In all actions
 
not triable of right by a jury the court upon motion or of
its own initiative may try any issue with an advisory jury.
The court, with the consent of the parties, may order a
trial with a jury whose verdict shall have the same effect
as if trial by jury had been a matter of right.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On November 3, 2010, Hahn's attorney signed the "Trial 
Setting Status Conference Order of - November 3, 2010," in which 
all parties consented to a jury trial. At no time before or during the trial did Hahn object to proceeding to trial by jury. Hahn only objected to proceeding via jury trial after the jury returned with an unfavorable verdict against him. Given that Hahn agreed to proceed via jury trial and failed at any time to request that his request be withdrawn, Hahn waived any objection. See Cnty. of Hawaii v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai
'i 352, 373, 198 P.3d 615, 636 (2008) ("As a general rule, 
if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil cases." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hahn's Motion to Vacate.• 
IV. Treble Damages
A. Proximate Causation
 
Hahn contends the circuit court erred in trebling the
 
jury verdict because the jury did not "make a specific finding of
 
which damages were separately proximately caused by the unfair
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
methods of competition." Hahn appears to contend that because
 
the jury did not specifically find that WSTCO's $200,000 worth of
 damages were proximately caused by Hahn's unfair methods of
 competition, the circuit court could not treble WSTCO's damages.
 
Like an award of punitive damages, treble damages, as
 
provided under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 480-13(b) (2008
 
Repl.), are a form of deterrence. Han v. Yang,  84 Hawai 'i 162, 
177, 931 P.2d 604, 619 (App. 1997) ("Treble damages are a form of
 
deterrence and hence serve a purpose similar to punitive
 damages."). HRS § 480-13(b) provides:
 
§480-13 Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery,
injunctions. . . . .
 
(b) Any consumer who is injured by any unfair or
deceptive act or practice forbidden or declared unlawful by
section 480-2:
 
(1)	 May sue for damages sustained by the consumer,
and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the
plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less than
$1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff
sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and
reasonable attorney's fees together with the
costs of suit[.]
 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 480-2(a) (2008 Repl.) states in relevant
 
part that "[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or
 deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
 commerce are unlawful."
2 This court has maintained that HRS
 
3
 § 480-2 "outlaws unfair methods of competition and unfair or
2
 "Any person may bring an action based on unfair methods of
competition declared unlawful by [HRS § 480-2]." HRS § 480-2(e).

 HRS § 480-2 provides:
 
§ 480-2 Unfair competition, practices, declared
unlawful. (a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or
deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce are unlawful.
 
(b) In construing this section, the courts and the
office of consumer protection shall give due consideration
to the rules, regulations, and decisions of the Federal
Trade Commission and the federal courts interpreting section
5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C.
45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended.
 
(c) No showing that the proceeding or suit would be in
the public interest (as these terms are interpreted under
section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act) is
necessary in any action brought under this section.

deceptive trade practices in sweeping terms." Han, 84 Hawai 'i at

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 63 Haw. 289, 300, 627 P.2d 260, 268 (1981)). HRS § 480-2 does not define "unfair methods of competition," but in general the statute "was constructed in broad language in order to constitute a flexible tool to stop and prevent . . . fraudulent, unfair or deceptive business practices for the protection of both consumers and honest businessmen and businesswomen."

Partners v. Equilon Enters. LLC, 679 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1209 (D. Haw. 2009).

relations between WSTCO and Ace, tortious interference with
 
prospective economic advantage as to WSTCO and 7D, tortious
 interference with prospective economic advantage as to WSTCO and
 Ace, unfair competition under HRS § 480-2, and deceptive trade
 practice under HRS § 481A-3 (2008 Repl.). The Second Amended
 Complaint did not allege new facts or conduct in support of
 Appellees' unfair competition claim. Instead, the complaint
 alleged:
 
COUNT VIII - UNFAIR COMPETITION UNDER
 
HAWAII REVISED STATUTES SECTION 480-2
 
(HAHN)

 
60. Plaintiffs repeat and herein incorporate by
reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through
59 above.
 
61. The actions of HAHN described herein constitute
 
unfair methods of competition prohibited by Hawaii Revised
Statutes Section 480-2.
 
62. As the direct result of said unfair method of
 
competition, Plaintiffs suffered damages in amounts to be
proved at trial.
 
Thus, the facts that constituted Appellees' tortious interference
 
claims also constituted the basis of Appellees' unfair
 competition claim against Hahn. Appellees' complaint is
 consistent with their theory of the case, as expounded upon
 during Appellees' closing remarks. In essence, Appellees argued
 during closing arguments that Hahn engaged in unfair competition
 when he tortiously interfered with contractual and business
 relations. The jury found, inter alia, that Hahn tortiously
 interfered with a contract between WSTCO and 7D, tortiously
 interfered with a business relationship between WSTCO and 7D, and
 engaged in unfair methods of competition against WSTCO. The jury
 found that WSTCO suffered $200,000 in damages "as a result of
 [Hahn's] conduct."
 
Based on our reading of the Appellees' pleadings, the
 
trial proceedings, and the jury's special verdict form, WSTCO
 successfully proved the elements necessary to treble its damages,
 pursuant to HRS § 480-13(b)(1). "The elements necessary to
 recover on an unfair or deceptive trade acts or practices claim
 under HRS § 480-13(b)(1) are: (1) a violation of HRS § 480-2; (2)
 injury to the consumer caused by such a violation; and (3) proof
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the amount of damages." Davis v. Wholesale Motors, Inc., 86 
Hawai'i 405, 417, 949 P.2d 1026, 1038 (App. 1997). Here, (1) the 
jury found that Hahn violated HRS § 480-2 by engaging in unfair 
methods of competition; (2) WSTCO sustained an injury i.e., a breached contract, that was the result of Hahn's tortious interference with a contract, and an impaired business relationship, that was the result of Hahn's tortious interference with a business relation); and (3) WSTCO suffered damages totaling $200,000 as a result of its injury. See id. Thus, 
pursuant to HRS § 480-13(b)(1), the circuit court was required to award WSTCO treble damages. See HRS § 480-13(b)(1); see also 
Han, 84 Hawai
'i at 177, 931 P.2d at 619 (trial court trebled 
compensatory damages awarded to plaintiff after jury found that defendant had engaged in unfair or deceptive practices). The circuit court, therefore, did not err in trebling WSTCO's damages, pursuant to HRS § 480-13(b)(1). 
Hahn also claims that "[t]he same problem exists with
 
respect to the verdict as awarded in favor of Ace." However,
 unlike the jury's verdict as to Hahn's conduct against WSTCO, the
 jury only found Hahn liable for unfair methods of competition
 against Ace. As a direct result of Hahn's unfair competition,
 the jury awarded Ace $381,000 in damages. Thus, Ace's award does
 not raise the same factual questions as WSTCO's award and the
 circuit court did not err in trebling Ace's damages.
B. Specific Pleading
 
Hahn alleges that "[t]he trial court also erred in
 
awarding [Appellees] treble damages because they never alleged
 these damages in the pleadings or even during trial." In
 essence, Hahn alleges that treble damages must be specifically
 pled in a complaint. However, no such pleading was required for
 Appellees to recover treble damages. 
"Hawaii's rules of notice pleading require that a 
complaint set forth a short and plain statement of the claim that provides defendant with fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which the claim rests." In re Genesys 
Data Technologies, Inc., 95 Hawai
'i 33, 41, 18 P.3d 895, 903 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2001); see HRCP Rule 8(a).4 Furthermore, HRCP Rule 8(f) 
provides that "[a]ll pleadings shall be so construed as to do 
substantial justice." See In re Genesys Data Technologies, Inc., 
95 Hawai 'i at 41, 18 P.3d at 903 ("Pleadings must be construed 
liberally."). 
Like general damages and unlike special damages, there
 
is no requirement that statutorily awarded treble damages be
 specifically pled in a plaintiff's complaint. See cf. HRCP Rule
 
9(g) (providing that "[w]hen items of special damage are claimed,
 they shall be specifically stated."). "[S]pecial damages are
 those damages which are of a relatively unusual kind and which,
 without specific notice to the adversary, may not be understood
 to be part of the claim." Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 45, 51, 451
 
P.2d 814, 819 (1969). Conversely, "general damages are those
 damages which usually accompany the kind of wrongdoing alleged in
 the complaint so that the mere allegation of the wrong gives
 sufficient notice to the opposite party of the kind of damage
 that will be claimed at trial[.]" Id.; see 22 Am. Jur. 2d
 
Damages § 644 (2015) ("[G]eneral damages need not be pleaded with
 specificity because the opposing party is on notice as a matter
 of law that general damages arise from the nature of the injury
 alleged."). 
A request for treble damages, pursuant to HRS § 480­
13(b)(1), is more like a request for general damages than a
 request for special damages. HRS § 480-13(b)(1) statutorily
 provides that a plaintiff injured by conduct declared unlawful by
 HRS § 480-2 may sue for damages and "shall be awarded a sum not
 less than $1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained,
 whichever sum is the greater," if judgment is for plaintiff. 
(Emphasis added.) Therefore, like general damages, Appellees'
 
4
 HRCP Rule 8(a) provides:
 
Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading.
 
(a) Claims for Relief. A pleading which sets forth a
claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim,
cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short
and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is
entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the
relief the pleader seeks. Relief in the alternative or of
several different types may be demanded.
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
allegation that Hahn engaged in unfair methods of competition,
 
pursuant to HRS § 480-2, gave Hahn sufficient notice that, as a
 matter of law, Appellees were entitled to treble damages if
 successful on their HRS § 480-2 claim. Therefore, Appellees did
 not have to specifically plead treble damages in their Second
 Amended Complaint.
V. Sufficiency of Evidence
 
Hahn contends there was insufficient evidence to
 
support a claim of tortious interference with a contract or
 
tortious interference with a business relationship because
 Appellees failed to show that Hahn had the requisite intent.
 
The elements of tortious interference with contractual
 
relations include:
 
(1) a contract between the plaintiff and a third party; 2)
the defendant's knowledge of the contract; 3) the
defendant's intentional inducement of the third party to
breach the contract; 4) the absence of justification on the
defendant's part; 5) the subsequent breach of the contract
by the third party; and 6) damages to the plaintiff. It is
 of the essence in an action for wrongful interference with
contractual relationships that the plaintiff suffer damages
as a consequence of the defendant's conduct, and these
damages cannot be speculative or conjectural losses.
 
Meridian Mortg., Inc. v. First Hawaiian Bank, 109 Hawai 'i 35, 44, 
122 P.3d 1133, 1142 (App. 2005) (emphasis in original, ellipsis 
and brackets omitted) (quoting Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 Hawai 'i 40, 
50, 890 P.2d 277, 287 (1995)). 
The elements of tortious interference with a
 
prospective business advantage include:
 
(1) the existence of a valid business relationship or a
prospective advantage or expectancy sufficiently definite,
specific, and capable of acceptance in the sense that there
is a reasonable probability of it maturing into a future
economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) knowledge of the
relationship, advantage, or expectancy by the defendant; (3)
a purposeful intent to interfere with the relationship,
advantage, or expectancy; (4) legal causation between the
act of interference and the impairment of the relationship,
advantage, or expectancy; and (5) actual damages.
 
Meridian Mortg., Inc. at 47-48, 122 P.3d at 1145-46 (emphasis 
added) (quoting Robert's Hawaii Sch. Bus, Inc., 91 Hawai 'i at 
258, 982 P.2d at 887). Thus, both torts require a showing that a defendant intended to induce the third party to breach a contract or intended to interfere with the relationship, advantage, or expectancy. 
12
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In order to establish a cause of action against a third
party for intentional interference with a contractual right,
it must be shown that the third party acted with intent and
legal malice, i.e., the intentional doing of a harmful act
without legal or social justification or excuse, or, in
order words, the wilful violation of a known right.

484, 634 P.2d 430, 434 (1981)). 
Hahn's testimony at trial indicated such an intent. 
Hahn testified that 7D had an exclusive business relationship with WSTCO for the distribution of 7D's dried mangoes in Hawai
'i 
and that the relationship was, at the least, based upon a verbal contract between 7D and WSTCO. In spite of 7D's exclusive relationship with WSTCO, Hahn approached 7D with the intention of inducing 7D to end its exclusive business relationship with WSTCO so that Hahn could get the 7D distribution contract, in contravention of WSTCO's contract with 7D. Hahn testified that once 7D agreed to do business with him, he helped to draft the letter that terminated 7D's exclusive relationship and contract with WSTCO. Based on the evidence in the record, there was substantial evidence to support a finding that Hahn intended to induce 7D to breach a contract with WSTCO and intended to interfere with WSTCO's business relationship with 7D. See In re 
Estate of Herbert, 90 Hawai
'i 443, 454, 979 P.2d 39, 50 (1999). 
Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's finding that Hahn tortiously interfered with the contract and tortiously interfered with the business relationship between 7D and WSTCO. 
VI. 7D's Default Judgment
A. Jury Instruction
 
Hahn argues the circuit court erred by not telling the
 
jury that WTSCO had been awarded a judgment against 7D for its
 
breach of contract with WSTCO. Hahn claims that "[b]y not
 informing the jury of the judgment against 7D, the jury was left
 with the false impression that WSTCO must recover its damages
 resulting from the breach [of contract], if at all, only from
 [Hahn]." (Emphasis omitted.) Hahn also argues that "the jury
 also should have been informed that WSTCO's damage formulation
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[sic] and analysis against 7D for simple breach of contract and
 
its damage formulation and analysis against [Hahn] for tortious
 interference and unfair competition were exactly the same." 
(Emphasis omitted.) Hahn claims that without the formulation and
 analysis, "the jury was left with the false impression that
 [Hahn's] alleged conduct was more egregious and damaging than
 that of 7D."
 
Hahn provides no legal support for his contention that 
the circuit court should have told the jury about WTSCO's judgment against 7D and no factual support for his contention that the jury had a false impression. Furthermore, Hahn's opening brief provides no citation to the record that would indicate that he requested such an instruction on the matter. See HRCP Rule 51(f). Indeed, the record indicates that at the time the jury entered its verdict against Hahn, the circuit court had not yet entered its default judgment against 7D.
5 Because 
Hahn provided no discernible argument in support of his contention, we deem his challenge waived. See Norton v. Admin. 
Dir. of Court, State of Hawai
'i, 80 Hawai 'i 197, 200, 908 P.2d 
545, 548 (1995); see also Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
B. Double Recovery
 
Hahn argues that "WSTCO's judgment against [him]
 
constitutes an illegal double recovery." In general, "[a]
 
plaintiff may not receive a double recovery for the same injuries
 or losses arising from the same conduct or wrong. Thus, a double
 or duplicative recovery for a single injury is invalid." 22 Am.
 Jur. 2d Damages, § 32 (2015) (footnote omitted); see e.g. Cieri
 v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc., 80 Hawai
'i 54, 69, 905 P.2d 29, 44 
(1995) ("[A]n award of both treble damages and punitive damages for the same act constitute improper double recovery." ( quoting Eastern Star, Inc., S.A. v. Union Bldg. Materials Corp., 6 Haw. App. 125, 141, 712 P.2d 1148, 1159 (1985))). "To prove a double recovery, a defendant must demonstrate an overlap between: (1)

 The jury entered its verdict against Hahn on April 5, 2012. The
 
circuit court granted-in-part and denied-in-part Appellee's motion for default
judgment against 7D on June 8, 2012.
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the injuries or damages for which a plaintiff has received
 
compensation; and (2) the injuries or damages that are the
 subject of a plaintiff's claim against the defendant." 22 Am.
 Jur. 2d Damages § 32 (2015) (quoting Moore Auto. Grp., Inc. v.
 Lewis, 362 S.W.3d 462, 468 (Mo. Ct. App. 2012)). 
Here, WSTCO's recovery of damages from 7D did not
 
overlap with its recovery of damages from Hahn. Appellees sought
 recovery of damages against 7D for (1) breaching a contract with
 Ace; (2) tortiously interfering with contractual relations
 between WSTCO and Ace; and (3) tortiously interfering with
 prospective economic advantage between WSTCO and Ace. The
 circuit court granted-in-part and denied-in-part default judgment
 against 7D after 7D failed to respond to Appellee's Second
 Amended Complaint. WSTCO was awarded damages against 7D in the
 amount of $446,355.
6
 
WSTCO was awarded damages from Hahn in the amount of
 
$200,000 after the jury found that he had (1) tortiously
 interfered with contractual relationship between 7D and WSTCO;
 (2) tortiously interfered with the business relationship between
 7D and WSTCO; and (3) engaged in unfair methods of competition.
 
WSTCO's recovery against 7D pertained to 7D's breach of
 
contract with WSTCO and 7D's tortious interference between WSTCO
 and Ace. On the other hand, WSTCO's recovery against Hahn
 related to Hahn's unfair methods of competition and Hahn's
 tortious interference between WSTCO and 7D. Consequently, WSTCO
 did not receive double recovery from Hahn and 7D. See Moore
 
Auto. Grp., 362 S.W.3d at 468.
