BAC Home Loans Servicing LP, fka Countrywide Home Loans Services
 
LP and against Santos; Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/Third-
Party Plaintiff/Appellee First Hawaiian Bank; and
 Defendants/Cross-Claim Defendants/Appellees Hawaiian Cement and
 A&B P&L LLLC, Successor in Interest to A&B Properties.
 
On appeal, Santos claims to be the "Reigning Monarch" 
of the Hawaiian Islands and asserts the State of Hawai
'i and its 
courts are illegitimate, and therefore have no jurisdiction over Santos or his actions. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Santos' appeal is without merit. See State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai
'i 219, 
883 P.2d 641 (App. 1994). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the June 25, 2014 Judgment
 
entered in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, May 27, 2015.
