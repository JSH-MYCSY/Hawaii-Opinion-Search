SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
In this appeal arising out of a foreclosure decree,
 
Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant Mary Lee Colton, pro
 
se, appeals from the July 8, 2014 Judgment entered by the Circuit
 Court of the Third Circuit ("Circuit Court")
1/ in favor of
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee The Bank of New York
 Mellon, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWABS Inc.,
 Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-11 ("Mellon"), and against
 Colton.
 
On appeal, Colton contends that the Circuit Court: (1)
 
denied Colton due process of law when Bank of America-related
 evidence was placed on the record without Bank of America being a
 party to the case; (2) erred in granting summary judgment to
 Mellon despite the fact that Bank of America had sold servicing
 rights to Colton's loan to Specialized Loan Servicing LLC; (3)

abused its discretion in failing to sanction Mellon for its
 
failure to file a pre-trial statement within ten days of a court
 order that required it; (4) ignored Colton's evidence that she
 "was not receiving service by [Mellon's] counsel"; and (5) erred
 in denying Colton's motion to strike various unnotarized
 declarations, attorney affirmations, and documents in the record,
 submitted in support of Mellon's motion for summary judgment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Colton's points of
 error as follows and vacate and remand.
 
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai
'i 
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that to 
establish the right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject promissory note, at the time the action was commenced. Id. at 
367-70, 390 P.3d at 1254-57. The "foreclosing plaintiff's burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as '[s]tanding is concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring suit.'" Id. at 367, 390 P.3d at 1254 (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai
'i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)). The supreme court 
further noted that "a foreclosing plaintiff does not have standing to foreclose on mortgaged property unless the plaintiff was entitled to enforce the note that has been defaulted on." Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (citing Hanalei, BRC Inc. v. Porter, 7 Haw. App. 304, 310, 760 P.2d 676, 680 (1988)). 
Similar to Reyes-Toledo, the Circuit Court here granted
 
Mellon's motion for summary judgment and decree of foreclosure
 based on two documents attached to Mellon's summary judgment
 motion: (1) a Declaration of Indebtedness by Mary Beth Fetkovich,
 executed on July 15, 2013, stating that she is familiar with the
 type of records maintained by Mellon and that Mellon, directly or
 through an agent, "has possession" of the promissory note; and
 (2) the promissory note, which was endorsed in blank.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Mellon did not present evidence to establish its
 
entitlement to enforce the promissory note at the time the action 
commenced. On February 1, 2013, Mellon filed a Complaint for Foreclosure, which states that Mellon "is the holder of the Note and record assignee of the Mortgage." However, the promissory note was not attached to the complaint and there is no evidence that Mellon held the note at the time the complaint was filed. Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in granting Mellon's summary judgment motion. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai
'i at 370-71, 390 P.3d 
at 1257-58. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 8, 2014

 
Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit in
 favor of Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee The Bank of
 New York Mellon, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWABS
 Inc., Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-11 is vacated. This
 case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.
