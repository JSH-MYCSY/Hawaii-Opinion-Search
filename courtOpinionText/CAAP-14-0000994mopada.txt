I. BACKGROUND
2
 
On October 10, 2003, Chirayunon entered into a
 
leasehold agreement with Kahala Gardens Apartments, Inc. (Co-op)
 
for Apartment Number (Unit 9). In May 2007, the Co-op elected to
 
convert from a leased-fee interest co-op to a fee-simple

 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.

condominium, which Chirayunon, as a leasehold interest holder,
 
agreed to in writing. The Co-op purchased the property with a
 mortgage from HNB on July 25, 2007.
 
The Co-op presented three options to the apartment
 
owners: (1) immediately purchase the unit in fee and secure
 financing with new first mortgage lien on the condominium unit
 with a pro rata pay down and partial release of HNB's mortgage
 (Option 1); (2) vacate the unit when the proprietary lease term
 
expires on July 31, 2007 (Option 2); or (3) pay the unit's pro
 
rata share of HNB's mortgage loan carrying costs to the Co-op in
 
lieu of rent for the land and later refinance with a new first
 mortgage on or before the due date of August 10, 2016 (Option 3). 
Chirayunon and the Co-op agreed on Option 3.
 
Chirayunon spent over $200,000 in a three-year period
 
in building materials, fixtures, and appliances upgrading the
 
interior of Unit 9. The Co-op approved Chirayunon's renovation
 plans.
 
On May 11, 2011, HNB and Chirayunon entered into a
 
rental agreement for Unit 9 with the end date of December 31,
 2011.
 
On June 3, 2011 Chirayunon signed a "Cancellation and
 
Termination of Lease and Agreement" (Cancellation Agreement),
 
which terminated his interest in the proprietary lease. 
According to Chirayunon, HNB threatened to send the police to the
 Unit to lock him and his family out of his home in order to
 convince him to sign this agreement. Chirayunon further attests
 that the Cancellation Agreement did not terminate his rights in
 the property under Option 3.
 
The May 11, 2011 rental agreement was extended to March
 
30, 2012, again to May 31, 2012, and finally to August 31, 2012,
 when the rental agreement ended.
 
On October 17, 2012, HNB filed a complaint for summary
 
possession in the District Court of the First Circuit (district
 
court). On March 25, 2013, the district court granted
 
Chirayunon's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject
 
matter jurisdiction.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On April 3, 2013, HNB filed a complaint in the circuit
 
court for declaratory relief, possession, and damages. HNB moved
 
for partial summary judgment on August 12, 2013 on its claims for
 declaratory relief and possession of Unit 9. On June 30, 2014,
 the circuit court entered the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion
 for Partial Summary Judgment, Filed August 12, 2013."
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(c) 
entitles a party to summary judgment "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." The Hawai
'i 
Supreme Court has elaborated: 
A fact is material if proof of that fact would have
the effect of establishing or refuting one of the
essential elements of a cause of action or defense
 asserted by the parties. The evidence must be viewed
 in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.
In other words, we must view all of the evidence and
inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable
to the party opposing the motion.
 
Nuuanu Valley Ass'n v. City & Cnty. Of Honolulu, 119 Hawai 'i 90, 
96, 194 P.3d 531, 537 (2008) (quoting Kahale v. City & Cnty. Of 
Honolulu, 104 Hawai 'i 341, 344, 90 P.3d 233, 236 (2004)). The 
grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Nuuanu 
Valley Ass'n, 119 Hawai 'i at 96, 195 P.3d at 537. 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Chirayunon contends that numerous genuine issues of
 
material fact remain in dispute as to whether he had an interest
 in Unit 9 based on the Option 3 agreement.
 
In ruling on HNB's motion for summary judgment, the
 
circuit court held:
 
In this case, I do find that [HNB] has met its
initial burden of establishing there is no genuine
issue of material fact as to [HNB's] claim for
declaratory relief, that [Chirayunon] has no right,
title, or interest in the subject property, which
we've been referring to as Unit 9, and that [HNB] is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. As such, the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
burden shifts to [Chirayunon] to establish their
admissible evidence that a genuine issue of material
fact for trial exists.
 
[Chirayunon] claims to have a leasehold interest
in Unit 9 and also claims to have an option to
purchase Unit 9 in fee simple on or before August 10,
2016. As to [Chirayunon's] claim that he holds a
leasehold interest in the subject property,
[Chirayunon] has not produced any evidence that would
create a genuine issue of material fact for trial that
he holds a leasehold interest in the unit. 
The undisputed record evidence establishes that
prior to [the Co-op's] conversion from a co-op to a
condominium, [Chirayunon] had an interest in the [CoÂ­op] and then had a residential lease as to Unit 9. As
 to [Chirayunon's] interest in the [Co-op], that
interest was cancelled and terminated pursuant to the
[Cancellation Agreement], which was attached as
Exhibit 1 to [HNB's] motion for summary judgment. The
 lease termination and agreement was executed by the
[Chirayunon]. That's not disputed.
 
. . . .
 
[Chirayunon's] claim that he made real property
tax payments on the unit is unsupported by the record.
Rather, the undisputed evidence is that since [HNB]
acquired its ownership interest in the unit, [HNB] has
made the real property tax payments. [Chirayunon] has
merely submitted invoices, but no proof of any
payments.
 
Also, the fact that [Chirayunon] obtained a
permit or permits from the City and County to make
interior improvements to the unit does not create a
genuine issue of material fact for trial that
[Chirayunon] actually holds a leasehold interest in
the unit. The undisputed record evidence does not
create any genuine issue of material fact for trial
that [Chirayunon] held a leasehold interest in the
property. Rather, the evidence establishes that
[Chirayunon's] possessory interest in the property was
as a tenant by 2012.
 
As to [Chirayunon's] claim that he had an option
to buy the fee simple interest in the property by
August 2016, [Chirayunon] has not established a
genuine issue of material fact for trial as to the so-
called option.
 
First, under the statute of frauds, such an
option to purchase the unit must be in writing.
[Chirayunon] himself does not have the option in
writing. Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 656-1
 requires any contract for the sale of lands,
tenements, or of any interest in or concerning them to
be in writing. The statute of frauds also requires
any agreement that is not to be performed within one
year from the making thereof to be in writing.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Again, [Chirayunon], who claims he executed an
option to buy the unit by August 2016, does not have a
copy of the option himself. And notwithstanding being
given three continuances to locate such an option,
[Chirayunon] has not done so. The only reasonable
inference is that such an option does not exist.
Other than his verbal assertion that such an option
existed, he has not been able to produce any written
document evidencing such an option. He has not been
 able to produce any other witnesses who can even
testify as to the existence of any such option, and
that it was ever given to prior stockholders of [the
Co-op].
 
. . . .
 
As [Chirayunon] has not established any genuine
issue of material fact that he has an interest in Unit
 
9, whether it was a leasehold interest or with an
option to purchase the property by August 2016, [HNB]
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 
As to [Chirayunon's] claim that he signed the
residential lease agreement under duress, that claim
is unsupported by the record evidence. 
. . . .
 
Even if it were true that [Chirayunon] was told the
police would be sent to his home to lock him out and evict

his family, [Chirayunon] did not have any interest in Unit 9
and no legal right to occupy the property. [HNB] had a good-
faith basis to threaten eviction, given that [Chirayunon]
had no interest in the property. Therefore, this would not
constitute duress. And I'm relying on [Kam Chin Chun Ming
v. Kam Hee Ho, 45 Haw. 521, 532, 371 P.2d 379, 388 (1962)]. 

A. Statute of Frauds
 
Chirayunon cites to Yee Hop v. Young Sak Cho , 25 Haw.
 
494 (Haw. Terr. 1920) for the proposition that "[t]enants under
 
an oral lease with an option to extend the term, who improve the
 premises with the knowledge and consent of the prior lessor, have
 a valid title claim sufficient to defeat a summary possession
 claim filed by the lessor's successor." In essence, Chirayunon
 argues that the Statute of Frauds does not apply because his
 partial performance has taken him out of the Statute of Frauds. 
Chirayunon's partial performance was his substantial renovations
 to Unit 9, which were approved by the Co-op, as well as his
 consistency in paying off his allocated share of the mortgage. 
In his declaration in support of his opposition to partial
 summary judgment, Chirayunon declares that he spent over $200,000
 to complete interior improvements to the unit. In addition,
 
5

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Chirayunon states that he paid his pro rata share of the mortgage
 
directly to HBN before entering into a rental agreement with HNB
 on May 11, 2011. Chirayunon asserts that his rental payments
 were the equivalent of the pro rata mortgage payments under the
 Option 3 agreement.
 
Part performance takes an oral agreement out of the
 
Statute of Frauds "where there has been substantial reliance by
 the party seeking to enforce the contract." Hawaiian Trust Co.
 
v. Cowan, 4 Haw. App. 166, 171, 663 P.2d 634, 637 (1983) (quoting
 McIntosh v. Murphy, 52 Haw. 29, 34, 469 P.2d 177, 180 (1970))
 (internal quotation marks omitted). "The part performance must
 be such that to allow a promisor to repudiate would constitute an
 injustice upon the promisee." Hawaiian Trust Co., 4 Haw. App. at
 
171, 663 P.2d at 637.
 
Here, taking the facts in the light most favorable to
 
Chirayunon, the substantial improvements made to the property
 takes his purported agreement for Option 3 out of the Statute of
 Frauds.
3 It would be an injustice to Chirayunon to allow the CoÂ­
op to repudiate its promise in light of Chirayunon's performance
 improving the property. Id. Therefore, the purported Option 3
 
agreement between Chirayunon and the Co-op does not need to
 satisfy the Statute of Frauds.
B. Existence of the Option 3 Agreement
 
Chirayunon suggests that his interest in Unit 9 is
 
based in his acceptance of Option 3, which "gave him the right to
 
purchase his pro-rata fee interest for $311,003.00 on or before
 the due date of [HNB's] mortgage loan, August 10, 2016." The
 circuit court was critical of Chirayunon for not citing to any
 evidence that establishes the existence of the Option 3 agreement
 with the Co-op beyond his declaration. In considering summary
 
3
 Chirayunon's declaration does not specifically state whether his
Option 3 agreement was oral or in writing. His counsel sought HRCP Rule 56(f)
continuances that were granted by the circuit court in order to conduct
discovery to locate documents, including the Option 3 agreement. Said
 discovery did not result in locating a written Option 3 agreement by
Chirayunon. Nonetheless, we conclude that based on Chirayunon's declaration,
his past performance renders the Statute of Frauds inapplicable.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment, however, all evidence must be taken in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party. Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, 119 
Hawai'i at 96, 195 P.3d at 537. "[W]here the record evinces a
 conflict in the evidence regarding the content of an 
affidavit . . . the credibility of the affiant . . . must be assessed by the trier of fact." Crichfield v. Grand Wailea Co., 
93 Hawai
'i 477, 488, 6 P.3d 349, 360 (2000). The existence of 
the Option 3 agreement will largely depend on Chirayunon's credibility, given the absence of written documentation, which is a matter for the trier of fact, and thus summary judgment is inappropriate. Crichfield, 93 Hawai
'i at 488, 6 P.3d at 360. 
C. Duress
 
Chirayunon disputes the circuit court's finding that 
the Cancellation Agreement was not signed under duress. Chirayunon cites to his declaration in opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment, in which he explained that HNB "had threatened to send the police to my property to evict and lock me and my family out of our home." In denying Chirayunon's duress defense, the circuit court relied on its conclusion that Chirayunon had no legal basis to occupy Unit 9 at the time the alleged threats were made and cited to Kam Chin Chun Ming, 45 Haw. at 532, 371 P.2d at 388. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court in Kam 
Chin Chun Ming recognized that the threat of litigation by a party who has a good faith claim does not constitute duress. Id. 
at 558-59, 371 P.2d at 402. However, Chirayunon alleges that he did have a right to occupy Unit 9. 
"[A]n agreement is voidable due to duress when a 
party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative." Balogh v. Balogh, 134 Hawai
'i 29, 44, 332 P.3d 
631, 646 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Standard Fin. Co. v. Ellis, 3 Haw. App. 614, 621, 657 P.2d 1056, 1061 (1983). Here, Chirayunon has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he had a legal right to occupy Unit 9, whether HNB made an improper threat, and whether he was left 
7

with no reasonable alternative, and as such, summary judgment was
 
inappropriate. HRCP Rule 56(c).
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The June 30, 2014 (1) "Order Granting Plaintiff's
 
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Filed August 12, 2013"; (2)
 July 9, 2014 Writ of Possession; and (3) July 9, 2014 Judgment
 for Possession all entered in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit are vacated and this case is remanded for further
