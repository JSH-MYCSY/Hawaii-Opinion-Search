I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 5, 2006, the Smiths executed a promissory 
note (Note) from Lime Financial Services, Ltd. (Lime Financial). 
As security for the Note, the Smiths executed a mortgage 
(Mortgage) on the property located at 49-078 Johnson Road, 
Kaneohe, Hawai 'i 96744 (Property) to Mortgage Electronic 
Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as nominee for Lime Financial. On December 1, 2006, MERS assigned the Mortgage to U.S. Bank. 
The assignment was recorded in the State of Hawai
'i Bureau of 
Conveyances (Bureau of Conveyances) on August 13, 2007 as 
document number 2007-144774. 
The Smiths failed to pay the amount due and owing
 
according to the Note and Mortgage, and U.S. Bank sent the Smiths
 
a notice of default on May 5, 2008. On July 16, 2009, U.S. Bank
 held a public auction of the Property and the Property was
 subsequently sold to U.S. Bank as the highest bidder. U.S. Bank
 executed a Quitclaim Deed for the Property and the Quitclaim Deed
 was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on September 23, 2009
 as document number 2009-146405.
 
On October 20, 2009, U.S. Bank filed a "Complaint for
 
Ejectment" (Complaint), alleging the Smiths were "still remaining
 
on the [Property] as trespassers and/or uninvited guests and
 
lessees." On February 23, 2010, U.S. Bank filed a "Motion for
 Summary Judgment, and For Writ of Ejectment Against [the Smiths]"
 (First MSJ). On March 10, 2010, the Smiths filed a "Memorandum
 
in Opposition to [U.S. Bank's First MSJ]" (Memorandum in
 
Opposition to First MSJ). In their Memorandum in Opposition to
 
First MSJ, the Smiths argued, inter alia, that summary judgment
 
in favor of U.S. Bank was not appropriate because the Note and
 Mortgage were void. Specifically, the Smiths argued that Lime
 Financial violated the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) and
 
engaged in Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 480. The
 
circuit court denied the First MSJ on March 29, 2010 after a
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
hearing held March 17, 2010.2
 
On December 4, 2013, U.S. Bank filed a "Motion for
 
Summary Judgment For Ejectment against [the Smiths]" (Second
 
MSJ). The Smiths did not file a memorandum in opposition to U.S.
 
Bank's Second MSJ. Instead, on February 25, 2014, the Smiths'
 
counsel filed a "Declaration of Counsel for [the Smiths] in
 Opposition to [U.S. Bank's Second MSJ]" (Declaration) stating
 
that "because [U.S. Bank's] motion raises nothing new and is
 
therefore precluded, it should be denied by the Court for the
 reasons previously argued by [the Smiths] in their [Memo in
 Opposition to First MSJ], which is attached and reincorporated
 herein." Counsel for the Smiths did attach the Memorandum in
 Opposition to First MSJ as an exhibit to the Declaration. The
 circuit court held a hearing on U.S. Bank's Second MSJ on March
 5, 2014 and took the matter under advisement.
 
On June 26, 2014, the circuit court entered its "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Ejectment
 Against All Defendants, Filed December 4, 2013," granting U.S.
 Bank's Second MSJ. In its order, the circuit court determined:
 
1. The three-year statute of repose under 15 U.S.C.
§ 1635(f) [(2011)] ha[d] expired on [the Smiths'] [TILA]
claims.
 
2. [The Smiths'] UDAP defenses cannot be asserted
against [U.S. Bank] because [U.S. Bank] did not originate
the loan.
 
3. [U.S. Bank's][Second MSJ] is GRANTED for the
reasons set forth above.
 
2. [sic] The non-judicial foreclosure held on July 16,
2009, for the Property . . . is CONFIRMED.
 
3. [sic] The Court shall award, pursuant to [HRS]
§ 603-36, a Writ of Ejectment against [the Smiths] and all
other persons claiming by, under and through [the Smiths']
possession of the Property.
 
On June 26, 2014, the circuit court also entered its "Final
 
Judgment Entered Against [the Smiths]," the "Notice of Entry of
 Judgment/Order," and the "Writ of Ejectment."
 
On July 25, 2014, the Smiths filed their notice of

appeal.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
[An appellate] court reviews a trial court's grant of
summary judgment de novo. O'ahu Transit Servs., Inc. v.
Northfield Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 231, 234, 112 P.3d 717, 720
(2005). The standard for granting a motion for summary
judgment is well settled: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, [the appellate court] must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the
 light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. TILA
 
The Smiths contend the circuit court erroneously found
 
that the Smiths did not timely exercise their right to rescind
 
their loan under TILA. In granting U.S. Bank's Second MSJ, the
 circuit court found the Smiths could not bring a TILA claim to
 rescind the loan because "[t]he statute of repose under 15 U.S.C.
 § 1635(f)
[3] ha[d] expired on [the Smiths'] Truth in Lending Act
 
3
 15 U.S.C. § provides in relevant part:
 
§ 1635. Right of rescission as to certain transactions
 
. . . . 
(f) Time limit for exercise of right
 An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years
after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon
the sale of the property, whichever occurs first,
notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms
required under this section or any other disclosures
required under this part have not been delivered to the
obligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforce
the provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding to
(continued...)
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
("TILA") claims."
 
15 U.S.C. § 1635(f) provides that "[a]n obligor's right
 
of rescission shall expire three years after the date of
 
consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property,
 whichever occurs first[.]" The United States Supreme Court in
 Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 790 (2015)
 recently had an opportunity to determine the method in which an
 obligor exercises his or her 15 U.S.C. § 1635(f) right to
 rescind. 
In Jesinoski, the Supreme Court was faced with similar
 
facts as those facts in the case before us. Id. at 791. On
 
February 23, 2007, the Jesinoskis refinanced the mortgage on
 their property by borrowing money from Countrywide Home Loans,
 Inc. (Countrywide). Id. On February 23, 2010, exactly three
 
years after the consummation of the loan transaction, the
 Jesinoskis mailed Countrywide and Bank of America Home Loans, who
 
had acquired Countrywide, (together, Respondents) a letter
 
purporting to rescind the loan. Id. On February 24, 2011, the
 
Jesinoskis filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a
 
declaration of rescission and damages. Id. 
The Federal District Court concluded that 15 U.S.C. §
 
1635(f) requires a borrower seeking rescission to file a lawsuit
 within three years of the transaction's consummation. Id. 
Although the Jesinoskis notified Respondents of their intention
 to rescind within the three year period, they did not file their
 first complaint until four years and one day after the loan's
 consummation. Id. As a result, the Federal District Court
 
granted the Respondent's motion for judgment on the pleadings,
 
3(...continued)
enforce the provisions of this section within three years
after the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) such
agency finds a violation of this section, and (3) the
obligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part on
any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor's
right of rescission shall expire three years after the date
of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale
of the property, or upon the expiration of one year
following the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicial
review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is
later.

and the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit (Eighth Circuit)
 
affirmed. (Citing Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 729
 
F.3d 1092, 1093 (2013)). Id.
 
On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the
 
Supreme Court noted that "[a]lthough [U.S.C. 15] § 1635(f) tells
 us when the right to rescind must be exercised, it says nothing
 about how that right is exercised." Id. at 792. The Supreme
 
Court opined:
 
[15 U.S.C. §] 1635(a) [(2011)] explains in unequivocal terms
how the right to rescind is to be exercised: It provides
that a borrower "shall have the right to rescind . . . by
notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of
the Board, of his intention to do so" . . . . The language
leaves no doubt that rescission is effected when the
 borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to rescind.
 It follows that, so long as the borrower notifies within
three years after the transaction is consummated, his
rescission is timely. The statute does not also require him
to sue within three years.
 
Nothing in [15 U.S.C.] § 1635(f) changes this conclusion. 
Id. at 792 (emphasis in original omitted and emphasis added). 
Because the Jesinoskis had given Respondents notice of their
 intent to rescind the loan within three years of the loan's
 consummation, the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Circuit
 erred in dismissing the Jesinoskis' complaint. Id. at 793. 
Like the Jesinoskis' loan from Countrywide, the Smiths
 
refinanced their home and entered into a loan with Lime Financial
 on September 6, 2006. The Smiths' counsel mailed their Notice of
 Rescission to Lime Financial and U.S. Bank on August 20, 2008,
 fewer than three years after the consummation of the loan
 transaction. Pursuant to the Supreme Court's holding in
 
4
Jesinoski,  the Smiths' rescission was timely and the circuit
court erred in finding that the statute of repose had expired on

 The Hawai' i Supreme Court has recognized that 
[w]hen [the United States Supreme Court] applies a rule of
federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the
controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given
full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct
review and as to all events, regardless of whether such
events predate or postdate [its] announcement of the rule.

(1993)).

the Smiths' TILA claims. 
B. UDAP
 
The Smiths contend the circuit court erred in
 
concluding that they could not raise a UDAP defense against U.S.
 
Bank. In granting U.S. Bank's Second MSJ, the circuit court
 found that "[the Smiths'] UDAP defenses cannot be asserted
 against [U.S. Bank] because [U.S. Bank] did not originate the
 loan."
 
HRS § 480-2(a) (2008 Repl.) provides that "[u]nfair 
methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." Under HRS § 480-12 (2012 Repl.), "[a]ny contract or agreement in violation of this chapter is void and is not enforceable at law or in equity." The Smiths' Mortgage and loan transaction fell "within the ambit of HRS [chapter] 480, inasmuch as (1) a loan extended by a financial institution is activity involving 'conduct of any trade and commerce' and (2) loan borrowers are 'consumers' within the meaning of HRS § 480–1 [(2008 Repl.)]." Keka, 94 Hawai
'i at 
227, 11 P.3d at 15. 
The United States District Court for the District of 
Hawai'i in Young v. Bank of New York Mellon, 848 F. Supp. 2d 1182 
(D. Haw. 2012) held, "[u]nlike a [HRS chapter] 480 damages claim,
 a rescission claim under [HRS [chapter] 480 can stand against
 subsequent assignees if the contract is void . . . ." Id. at
 
1193 (emphasis omitted). The U.S. district court noted that even
 where there is no evidence the current holder of the note and
 mortgage violated HRS chapter 480, "[HRS] § 480-12 can
 nevertheless provide a basis for rendering [the holder's] note
 and mortgage 'void and unenforceable' based on certain types of
 unfair or deceptive acts or practices committed by others in the
 loan consummation process." Id. (brackets in original) (quoting
 
Skaggs v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 2011 WL 3861373 at 7 (D. Haw. Aug.
 31, 2011)); see Newcomb v. Cambridge Home Loans, Inc., 861 F.
 Supp. 2d 1153, 1168 (D. Haw. 2012). Therefore, the circuit court
 erred in finding that the Smiths could not raise a UDAP defense
 against U.S. Bank.

C. Remand
 
Because the circuit court rejected the Smiths' TILA
 
claim on statute of limitations grounds and their UDAP claim on
 
the theory that it could not be raised against U.S. Bank, the
 circuit court did not address whether there were genuine issues
 of material fact regarding the merits of those claims. On
 remand, the circuit court shall determine whether genuine issues
 of material facts exist as to those claims.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the (1) June 26, 2014 "Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment for Ejectment Against All
 Defendants, Filed December 4, 2013;" (2) June 26, 2014 "Notice of
 Entry of Judgment/Order;" and (3) June 26, 2014 "Final Judgment
 Entered Against All Defendants," all entered in the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit are vacated and this case is remanded for
 proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.
