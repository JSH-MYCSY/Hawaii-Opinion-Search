APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-0704(2))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
In this appeal arising out of a termination dispute
before Intervenor-Agency Appellee Hawaii Labor Relations Board, 
Complainant-Appellant Stephanie Stucky appeals from the Circuit
Court of the Second Circuit's ("Circuit Court")1/ June 27, 2014
Final Judgment in favor of Respondents-Appellees Dwight Takeno,
Ray Camacho, Eric Nagamine, David Forrest, and Hawaii State
Teachers Association (collectively, "Union"), and the Board.  The
Final Judgment was entered pursuant to the March 25, 2013
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order which affirmed the
Board's Order No. 2854 dismissing Stucky's prohibited practices
complaint against the Union as moot.
1/The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided.NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Stucky was a teacher with the State of Hawaii,
Department of Education ("DOE").  On May 1, 2009, she was
notified of an unsatisfactory performance review and the DOE's
intention to terminate her employment.  The Union, on behalf of
Stucky, filed a Step 2 grievance with the DOE contesting the
discharge action (the "Termination Case").  In a decision dated
July 13, 2009, the DOE concluded that Stucky was properly
terminated.  The Union timely notified DOE of its intent to
arbitrate the Termination Case on July 15, 2009.
When the Termination Case did not proceed promptly to
arbitration, Stucky filed the instant complaint with the Board on
October 27, 2009, alleging that Union, in the course of
representing her in the Termination Case, failed to maintain
their duties in good faith, and committed prohibited practices
under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") section 89-13(b)
("Prohibited Practices Case").2/  Specifically, Stucky alleged
that Union failed to commence arbitration in her case in
conformance with the timelines established by the Collective
Bargaining Agreement ("Agreement"). 
The Termination Case proceeded to arbitration on
May 12, 2010, concluding with an arbitration award vindicating
the termination and awarding nothing to Stucky.  The arbitration
award noted that the parties stipulated that the matter was
arbitrable, and that the preliminary steps leading to arbitration
had either been met or waived, and the matter was properly before
2/HRS section 89-13(b) provides that:
(b) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public
employee or for an employee organization or its designated
agent wilfully to:
(1) Interfere, restrain, or coerce any employee in
the exercise of any right guaranteed under this
chapter; 
(2) Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith
with the public employer, if it is an exclusive
representative, as required in section 89-9; 
(3) Refuse to participate in good faith in the
mediation and arbitration procedures set forth
in section 89-11; 
(4) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of
this chapter; or
(5) Violate the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement.
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 89-13 (Supp. 2008).

the arbitrator. 
On May 21, 2012, Union filed a motion with the Board to
dismiss the prohibited practices complaint because the claim was
now moot.  The Board agreed and dismissed the complaint in Order
No. 2854.  Stucky appealed to the Circuit Court, which affirmed
the Board's order.
On appeal, Stucky contends that the Circuit Court erred
in affirming the Board's dismissal of her complaint as moot,
specifically challenging the Circuit Court's affirmation of
Findings of Fact ("FOF") 23 and 24 and Conclusions of Law ("COL")
6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 contained in Order No. 2854.3/  Stucky argues
that the issue is not moot as the Union's practice is both a
matter of public concern and one that is capable of repetition
yet evading review. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Stucky's
point of error as follows and affirm.
"It is axiomatic that mootness is an issue of subject
matter jurisdiction.  Whether a court possesses subject matter
jurisdiction is a question of law reviewable de novo."  Cnty. of
Hawai#i v. Ala Loop Homeowners,  123 Hawai #i 391, 403-04, 235 P.3d
1103, 1115-16 (2010) (emphasis added) (quoting Hamilton ex rel.
Lethem v. Lethem , 119 Hawai #i 1, 4-5, 193 P.3d 839, 842-43
(2008)).  As a preliminary matter, we must determine that
Stucky's claim is indeed moot before we consider possible
exceptions to the mootness doctrine.  
Stucky's claim for relief relate directly to her
Termination Case.  Stucky demanded that Union cease and desist
3/Stucky presumably also challenges the March 25, 2013 Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, specifically, FOF 18 (finding that the
Circuit Court "cannot state that the Board's Findings of Fact Nos. 23 and 24 .
. . were clearly erroneous"), COL 12 (concluding that "given the totality of
the record in this particular case and the arbitration that proceeded
specifically, the Court cannot say that Board Conclusions of Law Nos. 6 and 8
were wrong under the right-wrong standard"), and COL 18 (concluding that
"[t]herefore, the Court cannot say the Board erred as a matter of law in
Conclusions of Law Nos. 9 and 10), but makes no argument specific to those FOF
or COL.
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
the alleged prohibited practice, namely failing to conform to the
Agreement's timelines.  She also demanded that Union bring her
termination proceeding to arbitration as soon as possible.  
Subsequent to filing the complaint, but prior to the hearing in
the Prohibited Practices Case, the Termination Case was
arbitrated, and Stucky's termination was upheld.
It is well-settled that the mootness doctrine
encompasses the circumstances that destroy the
justiciability of a case previously suitable for
determination. A case is moot where the question to be
determined is abstract and does not rest on existing facts
or rights. Thus, the mootness doctrine is properly invoked
where "events ... have so affected the relations between the
parties that the two conditions for justiciability relevant
on appeal—adverse interest and effective remedy—have been
compromised."
In re Thomas, 73 Haw. 223, 225–26, 832 P.2d 253, 254 (1992)
(quoting Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawaii , 62 Haw. 391,
394, 616 P.2d 201, 203–04 (1980)).
Here, Stucky has already received the relief that she
sought in her Prohibited Practices Case.  Additionally, as in
Thomas, the relationship between the parties has been altered, in
this case terminated, such that the controversy is no longer
alive, and the Board could afford her no meaningful remedy.  See
Brownlow v. Schwartz , 261 U.S. 216, 217-18 (1923) (finding moot a
case where "[a]n affirmance would ostensibly require something to
be done which had already taken place.  A reversal would
ostensibly avoid an event which had already passed beyond
recall.")  Accordingly, Stucky's claim is moot, and we proceed to
consider whether any exceptions apply. 
Stucky contends that her complaint represents an
exception to the mootness doctrine, in that it is a matter of
public interest.  In support, she relies upon the fact that the
Union represents 13,000 employees.4/  Further, she argues that "a
union could provide the arbitration eventually (as in Stucky's
case) even though it failed to follow the clear and unambiguous
terms regarding timelines to arbitrate."
4/Stucky also refers to "[t]he decision of the union to willfully
comply or willfully fail to comply with the [Agreement] is an important public
policy that must be enforced."  She does not subsequently clarify this
statement, so it is unclear on what basis she contends that an agreement
between an employer and its employees is a matter of public concern.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
"When analyzing the public interest exception, this
court looks to (1) the public or private nature of the question
presented, (2) the desirability of an authoritative determination
for future guidance of public officers, and (3) the likelihood of
future recurrence of the question."  Hamilton , 119 Hawai #i at
6-7, 193 P.3d at 844-45 (brackets omitted) (quoting Doe v. Doe ,
116 Hawai #i 323, 327, 172 P.3d 1067, 1071 (2007)). Often, a
dispute between a union and a government employer is a matter of
public interest.  See State v. Nakanelua, 134 Hawai# i 489, 503,
345 P.3d 155, 170 (2015) (holding that a dispute between the
state and a union representing state employees was public in
nature); accord  Kaho #ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai# i 302, 333,
162 P.3d 696, 727 (2007) (finding that a dispute fell within the
public interest exception because the outcome would impact all
state employees).
The nature of the claims and the potential impact on
the public and the issues of alleged public interest in this
case, however, are significantly different from those in
Nakanelua or Kaho #ohanohano .  The supreme court has expanded on
this point, stating:
the cases in this jurisdiction that have applied the public
interest exception have focused largely on political or
legislative issues that affect a significant number of
Hawai#i residents. For example, in Doe, we held that the
public interest exception applied because it was "in the
public's interest for this court to review the family
court's ruling that Hawaii's grandparent visitation statute
[was] unconstitutional on its face." 116 Hawai #i at 327, 172
P.3d at 1071.  Additionally, in Kaho#ohanohano v. State , 114
Hawai#i 302, 162 P.3d 696 (2007), this court held that the
subject appeal was of a public nature because the outcome
would affect all state and county employees. Id. at 333, 162
P.3d at 727. Likewise, in Right to Know Committee v. City &
County of Honolulu , 117 Hawai #i 1, 175 P.3d 111 (App.2007),
the ICA held that the question presented was of a public
nature because the issue whether the City council must
conduct its business in full view of the public and in
compliance with the Sunshine Law was more public in nature
than private. Id. at 9, 175 P.3d at 119. In the instant
case, Father has not provided any evidence in the record
that the issues presented in his appeal involve political or
legislative matters that will affect a significant number of
people. Thus, inasmuch as Father's appeal is of a purely
personal nature, it fails to meet the first prong of the
public interest exception.
Hamilton, 119 Hawai# i at 7, 193 P.3d at 845.
In the instant case, Stucky litigates on behalf of
herself, rather than as a class representative in a class-action.
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
The right she seeks to enforce and the remedies she pleads are
all personal to her.  As such, her claims are more like those in
Hamilton where the remedies are personal in nature.  Stucky
contends that the fact that the Union represents 13,000 employees
implicates the public interest exception, but fails to explain
how a private claim alone, even when brought against a sizable
employer, implicates a matter of public interest.  Accordingly,
Stucky fails to establish application of the public interest
exception. 
Stucky also argues that her claims are not moot because
they are capable of repetition, yet evade review.  She argues
that "a union could provide the arbitration eventually (as in
Stucky's case) even though it failed to follow the clear and
unambiguous terms regarding timelines to arbitrate."
The phrase, "capable of repetition, yet evading review,"
means that a court will not dismiss a case on the grounds of
mootness where a challenged governmental action would evade
full review because of the passage of time would prevent any
single plaintiff from remaining subject to the restriction
complained of for the period necessary to complete the
lawsuit.
Life of the Land v. Burns , 59 Haw. 244, 251, 580 P.2d 405, 409–10
(1978) (emphasis added).  Stucky's contention fails for two
reasons.  First, the Union defendant is not charged with
"governmental action."  Second, the exception applies
specifically to the parties, not to similarly situated
hypothetical parties .  See Wong , 62 Haw. at 396, 616 P.2d at 205
(holding that a student's claim, seeking to enjoin his school
from disciplining him, was moot and not within the exception
where he was no longer a student and stating, "[t]he controversy
between the parties has thus clearly ceased to be definite and
concrete and no longer touches the legal relations of parties
having adverse legal interest."  (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.
Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-41 (1937))); see also Funbus Sys.,
Inc. v. State of Cal. Pub. Utilities Comm'n. , 801 F.2d 1120, 1131
(9th Cir. 1986)  (stating that "[t]his exception is applicable,
however, only in exceptional situations where the plaintiff can
show that he will again be subject to the same injury.")
The "capable of repetition, yet evading review"
exception requires that the aggrieved party be at risk of
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
receiving the same harm from the same party.  Wong, 62 Haw. at
396, 616 P.2d at 204-05 (holding that a former student that
suffered no enduring harm from an incomplete disciplinary
proceeding could not seek declaratory relief because the end of
the parties' relationship prevented the possibility of any
recurrent harm).  Stucky is no longer a member of the Union and
does not seek reinstatement.  Accordingly, she fails to "show
that the subject complained of could 'reasonably be expected to
recur'",  Life of the Land , 59 Haw. at 252, 580 P.2d at 410
(quoting United States v. Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199,
203 (1968)), and thus fails to establish application of the
capable of repetition, yet evading review exception.
Therefore, the June 27, 2014 Final Judgment and the
March 25, 2013 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
entered in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit are affirmed.
