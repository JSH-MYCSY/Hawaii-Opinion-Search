EDWIN DELA CRUZ, Claimant-Appellant, v.
WASA ELECTRICAL SERVICES, INC., Employer-Appellee, and
DTRIC INSURANCE COMPANY, LTD., Insurance Carrier-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2012-334(K) (4-09-01082))

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley And Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Edwin Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz) appeals
 
from the Decision and Order of the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board (Board) filed July 14, 2014.
 
On appeal, Dela Cruz contends the Board erred in:
 (1) finding that he was foreclosed from an award of
 
additional permanent partial impairment because he did not
 request a review of the employer's denial of surgery;
 
(2) finding that Employer-Appellee Wasa Electrical
 
Services (Wasa) was not liable for additional permanent
 
impairment; and
 
(3) allowing into evidence a "records review" medical
 
report.

I. BACKGROUND
 
On October 14, 2009, Dela Cruz worked as an electrician
 
for Wasa. While walking down the stairs at work, Dela Cruz's
 
left knee buckled and he felt a sharp pain in his left knee
 (October 14 injury). In the WC-1 Employer's Report of Industrial
 
Injury (Wasa's WC-1) dated November 4, 2009, Wasa accepted
 
liability for Dela Cruz's October 14 injury.
 
Prior to the October 14 injury, Dela Cruz had suffered
 
from a left knee degenerative condition and had arthroscopic
 
surgery in 2003.
 
On November 2, 2009, Richard Goding, M.D. (Dr. Goding)
 
examined Dela Cruz and administered an injection for pain
 control. On December 16, 2009, Kent Davenport, M.D. (Dr.
 
Davenport) examined Dela Cruz at Wasa's request. On December 28,
 
2009, Dr. Goding submitted a treatment plan (Treatment Plan) for
 
a total left knee replacement (knee replacement surgery). Wasa
 
denied the Treatment Plan on January 4, 2010 based on Dr.
 
Davenport's opinion that the surgery was not required by or
 related to the October 14 injury. Dela Cruz did not object to
 Wasa's denial of the Treatment Plan. Dela Cruz elected to have
 knee replacement surgery in March 2010, covered under his private
 insurance.
 
On September 13, 2012, the Disability Compensation
 
Division (DCD) awarded Dela Cruz forty-one percent (41%)
 
permanent partial disability and $650.00 for disfigurement. On
 
September 21, 2012, Wasa and its insurer, Insurance Carrier-
Appellee DTRIC Insurance Company, Ltd., appealed the DCD's award
 to the Board. The Board found:
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
. . . .
 
12. Because [Dela Cruz] did not request a review of
[Wasa's] January 4, 2010 denial the Board finds that [Dela
Cruz] accepted [Wasa's] denial of the surgery as unrelated
to the work injury.
 
. . . .
 
16. The Board credits the opinions of Dr.

Davenport, [Thomas Grollman, M.D.], and [Leonard N. Cupo,
M.D. (Dr. Cupo)] and finds that the need for total knee
replacement was due [sic] the natural progression of a
preexisting condition unrelated to the [October 14 injury].
 
. . . .
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
. . . .
 
1. The only evidence of impairment in the record is
[James R. Langworthy, M.D.'s] rating, which was based on an
unauthorized total knee replacement.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Review of Agency Decisions
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 91-14(g) (2012 Repl.)
 
provides:
 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may
affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.
 
See Tause v. State, Dept. of Labor and Indus. Relations, 113
 
Hawai'i 1, 25, 147 P.3d 785, 809 (2006). Conclusions of law fall 
within subsections (1), (2), and (4), and are reviewed de novo
 
under the right/wrong standard. Id. (citing Potter v. Hawai 'i

Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co., 77 Hawai 'i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 
1246, 1249 (1994)). Findings of fact are reviewed under
 subsection (5) to determine if the agency was "clearly erroneous

in view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the
 
whole record." Tause, 113 Hawai 'i at 25, 147 P.3d at 809 (citing 
Poe v. Hawai 'i Labor Relations Bd., 87 Hawai 'i 191, 195, 953 P.2d 
569, 573 (1998)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Foreclosure of Additional Permanent Partial Impairment Award
 
Dela Cruz argues the Board erred by finding that his
 
failure to challenge the denial of his request for knee
 replacement surgery precluded a finding that the conditions
 warranting the surgery could have been attributable to the
 October 14 injury. The Board found:
 
Because [Dela Cruz] failed to request a review of
[Wasa's] January 4, 2010 treatment plan denial,
Section 12-15-51(c), Hawaii Workers' Compensation
Medical Fee Schedule, deems that [Dela Cruz] accepted
such denial.
 
The legal effect of the unchallenged denial,
therefore, is that [Dela Cruz] accepted [Wasa's]
denial of surgical treatment for a condition that was
considered not related to the accepted
left knee injury.
 
Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) Section 12-15-51(c) (effective
 
1/1/96; am 1/1/97; am 12/17/01) states:
 
(c) The attending physician or the injured
employee may request in writing that the director
review the employer's denial of the request for
elective surgery. The request for review shall be
filed with the director, copying the employer, within
fourteen calendar days after postmark of the
employer's denial. Failure to file a request for
review of the employer's denial to the director within
fourteen calendar days after postmark of the
employer's denial shall be deemed acceptance of the
employer's denial, and the attending physician may not
resubmit the same request for the same surgical
procedure for forty-five calendar days after postmark
of the employer's denial.
 
(Emphasis added.) By failing to file a request for review of
 
Wasa's denial, Dela Cruz accepted Wasa's denial of Dr. Goding's
 Treatment Plan, in other words, Dela Cruz accepted Wasa's denial
 of paying medical fees for the knee replacement surgery, as
 provided under the Workers' Compensation Medical Fee Schedule. 
However, by failing to challenge the denial of the Treatment
 Plan, Dela Cruz did not accept the conclusion that the October 14
 
4

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
injury did not cause a permanent partial disability. Therefore, 
to the extent the Board relied on the "waiver" to conclude that the conditions warranting the surgery were unrelated to the October 14 injury, the Board's conclusion was incorrect. See 
Tause, 113 Hawai
'i at 25, 147 P.3d at 809. 
B. Liability for Additional Permanent Impairment
 
Dela Cruz argues that "[t]he [Board] erred in finding
 
that although [Wasa] accepted liability for the left knee injury
 for the date of [sic] accident of Oct. 14, 2009, it was not
 liable for additional permanent impairment." Additionally, Dela
 Cruz notes in his opening brief the difference in definition
 between liability and compensability, but does not clarify how
 his argument avoids conflation of these two terms. This court
 gleans Dela Cruz's argument from a similar argument summarized in
 the Board's Decision and Order: 
[Dela Cruz] argued that [Wasa's] acceptance of
"liability" for the [October 14 injury] was broader
than an acceptance of "compensability," and was
equivalent to [Wasa's] waiver of further objections
and should also act as an acceptance of
impairment. . . .
 
According to [Dela Cruz], employers should be
considered to have waived their rights to dispute or
challenge all future benefits once liability was
accepted in a WC-1.
 
The Board rejected Dela Cruz's argument as unpersuasive.
 
Liability is defined as "[1] The quality or state of 
being legally obligated or accountable; legal responsibility to 
another or to society, enforceable by civil remedy or criminal punishment . . . . [2] . . . A financial or pecuniary obligation[.]" Black's Law Dictionary 997 (9th ed. 2009). Under 
either dictionary definition, there is no discernable basis for finding that by accepting liability for Dela Cruz's October 14 injury, Wasa also waived its ability to challenge the compensability of Dela Cruz's physical conditions or a finding of impairment. Nothing in Wasa's WC-1 suggests that Wasa waived future objections. As such, the Board's conclusion was correct. See Tause, 113 Hawai
'i at 25, 147 P.3d at 809.

C. Admission of "Records Review" Medical Report
 
Dela Cruz asserts that the Board erroneously considered
 
and credited the medical opinion of Dr. Cupo. The Board is not
 
"bound by statutory and common law rules relating to the
 admission or rejection of evidence. The [Board] may exercise its
 own discretion in these matters, limited only by considerations
 of relevancy, materiality, and repetition[.]" HAR ยง12-47-41
 (effective Nov. 5, 1981). Thus, this court reviews only whether
 the Board should have excluded Dr. Cupo's report on grounds of
 relevancy, materiality, or repetition.
 
Dela Cruz argues that Dr. Cupo's report should have 
been excluded from the Board's determination of his appeal because it was not based on a physical examination. However, the Board is permitted to consider any evidence it deems relevant. HAR ยง12-47-41. Dr. Cupo's report is based on a review of a number of records from examinations between February 23, 2004 through May 4, 2012. In his report, Dr. Cupo wrote, "There is no permanent partial impairment of the left lower extremity related to the left knee attributable to the recurrence of 10/14/09." Dr. Cupo's statements were directly related to the issues in front of the Board and were relevant to the appeal. Therefore, the Board's reliance on Dr. Cupo's report was not incorrect. See 
Tause, 113 Hawai
'i at 25, 147 P.3d at 809. 
Dela Cruz also argues that Dr. Cupo made improper legal 
conclusions rather than medical opinions. Dela Cruz's argument goes to the weight of Dr. Cupo's report, rather than its admissibility. See Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co., 53 
Haw. 406, 410-12, 495 P.2d 1164, 1167-68 (1972) (assigning little probative weight to a doctor's testimony that there was no connection between the claimant's death and his employment). Appellate courts "decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings . . . especially the findings of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field." Moi v. State, Dept. Of Public 
Safety, 118 Hawai
'i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 756 (2008) (citing

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai 'i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002)). 
That Dr. Cupo's report may have contained legal conclusions did 
not render the report inadmissible. In admitting Dr. Cupo's report, the Board was not incorrect. See Tause, 113 Hawai
'i at 
25, 147 P.3d at 809. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Decision and Order of the Labor and Industrial
 
Relations Appeals Board filed July 14, 2014 is vacated and this
 case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
