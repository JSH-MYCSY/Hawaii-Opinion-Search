ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard, Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal
filed on July 27, 2015 by Plaintiff-Appellee OneWest Bank, FSB
 
(OneWest Bank), the papers in support, the record, and no
 opposition having been filed, it appears that:
 

 
(1) On July 31, 2014, Defendants-Appellants Warren
 
Robert Wegesend Sr. and Thelldine Linmoe Wegesend (Appellants),
 through counsel Robert Lee Stone (Counsel), filed a Notice of
 Appeal stating the appeal was from:
 
1. This Court's Order of July 9, 2013: "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Plaintiff OneWest
Bank, FSB's Motion for Summary Judgment Against Defendants
Warren Robert Wegesend Sr., Thelldine Linmoe Wegesend,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as Receiver for
Washington Mutual Bank, and Mililani Town Association, for
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
an Order for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure and for
Entry of Final Judgment Pursuant to Haw. R. Civ. P. 54(b),
and
 
2. This Court's "Judgment" Order of July 9, 2013.
 
There are no such documents in the record on appeal and in fact
 
no documents were filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (circuit court) on July 9, 2013 (or July 9, 2014);
 
(2) It appears that a hearing was held in the circuit
 
court on July 9, 2014 regarding OneWest Bank's motion for summary
 judgment, and that the following day, July 10, 2014, a minute
 order was issued indicating that the circuit court would grant
 OneWest Bank's motion.
1 Appellants subsequently filed their
 
notice of appeal on July 31, 2014, but the circuit court had not
 yet entered an appealable written order or judgment. Appellants
 assert that an order granting a decree of foreclosure and a
 judgment were entered by the circuit court on September 11, 2014;
 
(3) On September 24, 2014, the record on appeal was
 
filed, but the record does not contain the purported September
 11, 2014 order granting a decree of foreclosure or the September
 11, 2014 judgment from which Appellants now apparently assert
 their appeal;
 
(4) On January 16, 2015, this court entered an "Order
 
to Show Cause Why the Appeal Should Not be Dismissed for Lack of
 Jurisdiction and Why the Appellants' Attorney Should Not Be
 Sanctioned" (Show Cause Order), stating that without the
 September 11, 2014 judgment and order in the record on appeal, it
 appeared that the court might lack appellate jurisdiction;
 
(5) The Show Cause Order gave Appellants notice that
 
they (a) failed to ensure that the record on appeal was

 Hawai'i appellate courts have consistently held that minute orders
are not appealable orders. See Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998) ("[A] minute order is not
an appealable order."); State v. English, 68 Haw. 46, 52, 705 P.2d 12, 16
(1985) ("Though the substance of the court's decision is captured in theminutes of court proceedings kept by the clerk who attended the hearing, theydo not substitute for the requisite written document; they are merely'prepared for [the court's] own use.' RCCH Rule 27." (footnote omitted)).

sufficient for appellate review in violation of Rule 11(a) of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP); and (b) failed to 
file the Civil Appeals Docketing Statement as required by HRAP Rule 3.1; 
(6) The Show Cause Order required Appellants to: move
 
the circuit court pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(e)(2)(B) to supplement
 the record on appeal with the circuit court's September 11, 2014
 judgment and order; to show cause why this court should not
 dismiss the case for lack of appellate jurisdiction or for
 failure to file a Civil Appeals Docketing Statement; and for
 Counsel to show cause why this court should not impose sanctions
 on him;
 
(7) On February 4, 2015, as a result of Appellants'
 
failure to comply with the Show Cause Order, this court issued an
 order dismissing the appeal and sanctioning Appellants' Counsel;
 
(8) On February 16, 2015, Appellants filed a Motion for
 
Reconsideration of the dismissal order;
 
(9) On March 10, 2015, this court entered an 
"Order (1) Granting in Part and Denying in Part the February 16,
 2015 Motion for Reconsideration and (2) Additional Sanction
 Issued to Robert Stone," which inter alia reinstated the appeal
 and allowed Appellants ten (10) days to file a motion in the
 circuit court to supplement the record with the September 11,
 2014 judgment and order pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(e)(2)(B);
 
(10) On July 27, 2015, OneWest Bank filed the instant
 
Motion, requesting an order dismissing the appeal and sanctioning
 Counsel for repeated failure to follow appellate rules and this
 court's orders. OneWest Bank contends, and Appellants do not
 dispute, that Appellants filed an untimely Renewed Motion to
 Supplement the Record on Appeal in the circuit court. On July 7,
 2015, the circuit court entered a minute order denying
 Appellants' untimely motion because it did not comply with the
 deadline ordered by this court;
 
(11) Without the September 11, 2014 judgment being part
 
of the record on appeal, we lack appellate jurisdiction in this

case. See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994); Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 667-51(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2014). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to
 
dismiss the appeal is granted and this appeal is dismissed for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction.
