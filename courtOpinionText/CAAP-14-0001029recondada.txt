 25, 2015, which seeks reconsideration of this court's August 13,

(HRAP) provides that "[a] motion for reconsideration may be filed
 by a party 
only within 10 days after the filing of the . . . 
ruling unless by special leave additional time is granted during
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
such period by a judge or justice of the appellate court
 
involved." (Emphasis added).
 
(2) Appellants' Motion is untimely under HRAP Rule 40.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that said Motion is
 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, September 1, 2015.
