ORDER

 
(1) GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART
THE FEBRUARY 16, 2015 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
AND
 
(2) ADDITIONAL SANCTION ISSUED TO ROBERT STONE
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the February 16, 2015 motion for
 
reconsideration pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) of this court's February 4, 2015 order
 
dismissing the appeal and sanctioning Robert Stone (Motion)
 
by Defendants-Appellants Warren Robert Wegesend, Sr., and
 
Thelldine Linmoe Wegesend (Appellants), by and through and in
 
conjunction with their attorney Robert Stone (Stone), and the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
February 16, 2015 Declaration in support of motion filed by
 
Stone, as amended by the February 25, 2015 Declaration in support
 of motion filed by Stone; (2) the memorandum in opposition
 (Opposition) filed by Plaintiff-Appellee OneWest Bank, N.A.
 
(Appellee), through counsel Jesse W. Schiel on February 18, 2015;
 
(3) Appellants' reply, filed February 25, 2015; and (4) the
 
record, it appears that:
 
(1) Stone asserts that he failed to receive notice of
 
the January 16, 2015 order to show cause but the Judiciary
 Information Management System (JIMS) confirms the document was
 
electronically served on Stone at both the primary and secondary
 
e-mail addresses he provided as a Judiciary Electronic Filing
 System (JEFS) User;
 
(2) Stone is responsible for monitoring the docket for
 
this appeal and he does not assert that he was unable to view the
 JEFS docket, or that he failed to receive notification of any
 other documents filed in this case;
 
(3) JIMS confirms that each document filed in this
 
appeal was electronically served on Stone at both his primary and
 secondary e-mail addresses;
 
(4) Stone asserts that his failure to monitor the
 
docket for this case was attributable to his illness from
 December 29, 2014, and including January 16, 2015, to February 4,
 2015;
 
(5) But Stone does not refute the facts presented in
 
the Opposition that he appeared at oral argument in a bankruptcy
 proceeding on January 22, 2015, and also worked on January 28,
 2015, where he e-mailed Appellee's counsel that his "calendar"
 was a "mess";
 
(6) The record is still insufficient and contrary to
 
this court's January 16, 2015 order, because attaching to the
 Motion a copy of the judgment and order on appeal does not
 properly supplement the record consistent with HRAP Rule
 10(e)(2)(B), and where it was Stone's responsibility to ensure,
 consistent with HRAP Rule 11(a), that the appealed order was part
 of the record such that the record was sufficient to review the
 points of error;
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(7) Although the Civil Appeals Docketing Statement
 
(CADS) was filed on February 9, 2015, five days after the appeal
 
had already been dismissed, the CADS was due, pursuant to HRAP
 
Rule 3.1, on July 31, 2014, at the same time the notice of appeal
 was filed, and irrespective of Stone's asserted "delegation" of
 that responsibility, it was Stone's responsibility to monitor and
 ensure that the CADS was timely filed without any reminder by the
 court;
 
(8) Although Stone asserts in the February 25, 2015
 
amended declaration that he paid, on February 14, 2015, the
 sanction ordered in the February 4, 2015 order, Stone failed to
 submit the sanction payment made out to the Director of Finance,
 along with a copy of the sanction order, to the appellate clerk
 as instructed in the February 4, 2015 order; and
 
(9) We will reconsider dismissal of the appeal
 
resulting from Stone's errors.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
 
granted in part and denied in part as follows:
 
1. Reconsideration of the dismissal of the appeal is
 
granted and the appeal is reinstated.
 
2. Within fourteen days from the date of this order,
 
Appellants shall file a reply brief, or notice that no reply
 brief will be filed, consistent with HRAP Rule 28(d), unless the
 time is otherwise extended pursuant to HRAP Rule 29(b).
 
3. Stone shall, within ten days after the entry of
 
this order, move the circuit court in Civil No. 13-1-0909-03,
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(e)(2)(B), to supplement the record on
 appeal with the circuit court's September 11, 2014 judgment and
 September 11, 2014 order;
 
4. Reconsideration of the sanction order is denied;
 
and
 
5. Failure to comply with this order may result in an
 
additional $100.00 sanction and dismissal of the appeal.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Stone is sanctioned
 
an additional $50.00 for failure to comply with the February 4,
 2015 sanction order. The instant sanction shall be paid by the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
attorney personally, without reimbursement. A check in the
 
amount of said sum, payable to the State Director of Finance,
 shall be deposited with the appellate clerk's office within ten
 days from the date of this order, with a copy of this order
 attached to said check. An affidavit of counsel attesting to
 said payment shall be filed with this court within ten days after
 entry of this order. Failure to comply with this order may
 result in additional sanctions.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerk
 
shall electronically serve and additionally shall mail a copy of
 this order to Stone.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerk 
shall immediately mail a copy of this order to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) for investigation. In referring this matter to ODC, the court does not express an opinion as to whether violations of the Hawai
'i Rules of Professional Conduct 
or the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai 'i have 
occurred.
