Petitioners-Appellants,
v.
CENTEX HOMES, a Nevada general partnership, 
Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(S.P. NO. 14-1-0156 (ECN))
MEMORANDUM OPINION
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Ginoza and Chan, JJ.)
On appeal are two consolidated cases, CAAP-14-0001036
and CAAP-14-0001373, arising from the same underlying matter in
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( circuit court).1 
In CAAP-14-0001036, Petitioner-Appellant RNI-N.V., L.P.
(RNI) appeals from an "Order Granting Respondent Centex Homes'
Motion for an Order to Confirm Final Arbitration Award in the
Arbitration by and between Centex Homes and Respondent RNI-N.V.,
LP" (Order Confirming Arbitration Award ) and an "Order Denying
Petitioners' Motion to Vacate Final Arbitration Award" (Order
Denying Motion to Vacate ), both filed on July 16, 2014, by the
circuit court.  RNI contends the circuit court erred when it
1  The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided over both cases.NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
refused to vacate and instead confirmed a final arbitration award
in favor of Respondent-Appellee Centex Homes ( Centex) and against
RNI, because the arbitrator, retired Chief Justice Ronald T.Y.
Moon (Arbitrator Moon), manifestly disregarded the law and
exceeded his authority.  RNI argues that we should vacate the
circuit court's orders and remand the case with instructions to
vacate the arbitration award and order a rehearing before a new
arbitrator. 
In CAAP-14-0001373, Petitioner-Appellant RNI challenges
the circuit court's "Supplemental Final Judgment" filed on
December 4, 2014 ( Supplemental Judgment ), and an "Order Granting
Respondent Centex Homes' Motion for Award of Reasonable
Attorney's Fees and Costs Incurred in Confirming Final
Arbitration Award in the Arbitration by and between Centex Homes
and Petitioner RNI-N.V., L.P.," filed on November 24, 2014
(11/24/14 Order Granting Fees ).  In this appeal, RNI contends the
circuit court abused its discretion in awarding $25,643.42 in
attorney's fees to Centex because the circuit court (1) did not
state the basis upon which it awarded said fees and (2) granted
fees which were unreasonable and excessive.  RNI argues we should
vacate the Supplemental Judgment and the 11/24/14 Order Granting
Fees. 
For the reasons discussed below, in CAAP-14-0001036, we
affirm the Order Confirming Arbitration Award and the Order
Denying Motion to Vacate.  In CAAP-14-0001373, we vacate the
Supplemental Judgment and the 11/24/14 Order Granting Fees, and
remand to the circuit court for further proceedings regarding
attorneys' fees.
I.CAAP-14-0001036
In reviewing RNI's challenges to the circuit court's 
Order Confirming Arbitration Award and the Order Denying Motion
to Vacate, we apply the following standard of review:
[J]udicial review of an arbitration award is confined to the
strictest possible limits, and a court may only vacate an
award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A–23 and modify
or correct on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A–24.  This
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
standard applies to both the circuit court and the appellate
courts.
In re Grievance Arbitration Between State Org. of Police
Officers, 135 Hawai #i 456, 461, 353 P.3d 998, 1003 (2015)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  "We review the
[circuit] court's ruling on an arbitration award de novo, but we
also are mindful that the [circuit] court's review of arbitral
awards must be extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential." 
Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 Hawai# i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404
(2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
A.Manifest Disregard of the Law 
RNI contends the circuit court erred in confirming and
not vacating the arbitration award because Arbitrator Moon
"manifestly disregarded the law" by: (1) failing to apply
collateral estoppel based on an arbitration award against Centex
in a separate proceeding involving the Nguyens, who, like RNI,
were also early purchasers of units at the Beach Villas at Ko
Olina; (2) holding that Centex did not owe a fiduciary duty to
RNI; (3) applying preclusive or conclusive effect to allegations
made by RNI in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, which RNI
withdrew and voluntarily dismissed without prejudice; and (4)
finding that a settlement agreement entered into by RNI, i.e.,
the Kanazawa settlement, covered claims in this arbitration.  
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 658A-23(a)  (2016)
specifies six grounds upon which a court shall vacate an
arbitration award.  Manifest disregard of the law is not among
them.  HRS § 658A-23(a) provides:  
[§658A-23]  Vacating award. (a) Upon motion to the
court by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the court
shall vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding if:
(1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or
other undue means;
(2) There was:
(A) Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator;
(B) Corruption by an arbitrator; or
(C) Misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing
the rights of a party to the arbitration
proceeding;
(3) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing
upon showing of sufficient cause for
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
postponement, refused to consider evidence
material to the controversy, or otherwise
conducted the hearing contrary to section
658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
(4) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;
(5) There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the
person participated in the arbitration
proceeding without raising the objection under
section 658A-15(c) not later than the beginning
of the arbitration hearing; or
(6) The arbitration was conducted without proper
notice of the initiation of an arbitration as
required in section 658A-9 so as to prejudice
substantially the rights of a party to the
arbitration proceeding.
Although exceeding an arbitration agreement between the
parties may be grounds for vacatur under HRS § 658A-23(a)(4),
disregard of or misapplication of the law is not.  Tatibouet , 99
Hawai#i at 234, 54 P.3d at 405 (holding that judicial review is
limited to "cases in which the arbitrators manifestly exceed the
agreement  between the parties" and "[a] misinterpretation of law
does not amount to exceeding enumerated powers[.]") (emphasis
added); Mathewson v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 82 Hawai# i 57, 70, 919
P.2d 969, 982 (1996) ("An arbitration award, if made in good
faith, is conclusive upon the parties, and . . . neither [party]
can be permitted to prove that the arbitrators decided wrong
either as to the law or the facts of the case.") (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted);  Matter of Hawai #i State
Teachers Association, 140 Hawai #i 381, 391-92, 400 P.3d 582, 592-
93 (2017) ("[W]here the parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby
assume all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the
risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of
law and in their findings of fact.") (citations omitted).
RNI's four arguments in support of its manifest
disregard of the law theory assert alleged misapplications of the
law by Arbitrator Moon.  Given that HRS § 658A-23(a) and Hawai# i
case law do not recognize misapplication of the law as a ground
for vacating an arbitration award, the circuit court properly did
not vacate the arbitration award on this ground.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
B.Exceeding the Arbitrator's Powers
RNI also argues that the circuit court erred in
confirming and not vacating the arbitration award because
Arbitrator Moon exceeded his authority under HRS § 658A-23(a)(4).
RNI bases its argument on Arbitrator Moon's failure to hold a
hearing by January 8, 2014, the alleged "latest date 'fixed' by
the Centex Sales Contract for commencement of the arbitration
hearing[.]"  
It is not particularly clear how RNI calculates its
position that the last date that a hearing could be held in the
arbitration was January 8, 2014.  Arbitrator Moon's decision
indicates that during a pre-hearing telephone conference, the
parties and Arbitrator Moon agreed pursuant to Section D.37.f.(3)
of the Sales Contract,2 that the hearing would be held on January
8, 2014.  Section D.37.f.(3) of the Sales Contract provides that
the arbitrator shall select the time to commence the hearing to
allow the parties adequate preparation, "but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after the filing of the last of the parties'
responses."  (Emphasis added.)  Given RNI's assertion that the
last date the hearing could be held was January 8, 2014, RNI's
argument apparently presumes that the last "response" in the
arbitration had to have been filed no later than sixty days
earlier, or on November 9, 2013.  However, the Sales Contract
2 Section D.37.f.(3) of the Sales Contract, titled "Conduct of
Arbitration Hearing" provides:
Unless a hearing is waived in writing by all parties, all
disputes shall be determined by the arbitrator after a
hearing conducted in accordance with these procedures.  The
arbitrator may, in the arbitrator's sole discretion, limit
testimony and argument, both legal and factual.  The hearing
shall be commenced at a time and place selected by the
arbitrator to afford each party adequate preparation for
presenting its position as to the dispute being arbitrated,
but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the filing
of the last of the parties' responses.  Unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the parties, the hearing shall be
concluded within twenty (20) days of commencement of the
hearing.
(Emphasis added.) 
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
does not appear to mandate a last "response" by November 9, 2013. 
As set forth in RNI's opening brief, Arbitrator Moon set a
schedule for filing motions by November 19, 2013, responses by
November 26, 2013, and replies by December 3, 2013.  Moreover,
after Arbitrator Moon initially denied summary judgment for RNI
and granted summary judgment for Centex on December 16, 2013, RNI
filed a motion on December 19, 2013 seeking that Arbitrator Moon
vacate his summary judgment ruling for Centex, which subsequently
lead to Arbitrator Moon setting further briefing schedules in the
proceeding.  Section D.37.f.(2) of the Sales Contract allows the
"arbitrator [to] permit a position statement, counter-position
statement, or response to be amended to add a question to be
resolved or defense only upon presentation of a reasonable basis
therefore." 
The Hawai #i Supreme Court has held that:
In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her
authority under the agreement, there should be no second
guessing by the court of the arbitrator's interpretation of
his or her authority so long as the arbitrator's
interpretation could have rested on an interpretation and
application of the agreement.
In re Grievance Arbitration Between State Org. of Police
Officers, 135 Hawai# i at 463, 353 P.3d at 1005.  Here, Arbitrator
Moon directly addressed his continuing authority after RNI
asserted that he had exceeded his authority by not holding a
hearing by January 8, 2014.  Arbitrator Moon found that, prior to
January 8, 2014, the parties "proceeded with the Arbitration
process as though the deadline did not pose an inflexible barrier
causing Arbitrator to lose his authority over the Arbitration if
January 8, 2014 passed without a hearing."3  Indeed, Arbitrator
Moon noted that RNI did not assert he was divested of authority
until after he issued a ruling on January 15, 2014, which was
3  Arbitrator Moon further found that "Claimants did not once prior to
the deadline indicate in any way that the deadline was approaching but acted
as though it did not exist and essentially ignored it.  A host of these
incidents are reflected in both parties' written submissions, exhibits,
actions and inactions."
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
adverse to RNI.  Arbitrator Moon ruled that "[b]ased on [RNI's]
representations, actions and inaction, [RNI is] deemed to have
abandoned or waived [its] deadline position.  Arbitrator decides
that he continues to retain jurisdiction and authority over this
Arbitration."
Given the language of sections D.37.f.(2) and
D.37.f.(3) of the Sales Contract, that the parties submitted
written arguments up to January 20, 2014, and the deference which
the Hawai #i Supreme Court has held must be given to an
arbitrator's determination of his or her scope of authority, see
Id. at 464, 353 P.3d at 1006, we conclude that Arbitrator Moon
did not exceed his authority by holding a hearing after January
8, 2014.
II.CAAP-14-0001373 (Attorneys' Fees)
As a threshold matter, the December 4, 2014
Supplemental Judgment is invalid because the circuit court lacked
subject matter jurisdiction to alter the substance of the July
29, 2014 Final Judgment while the appeal in appellate court case
number CAAP-14-0001036 was already pending.  TSA Int'l Ltd. v.
Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai #i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999)
(holding that "[g]enerally, the filing of a notice of appeal
divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed
case.").  Accordingly, we vacate the December 4, 2014
Supplemental Judgment.
The circuit court had jurisdiction to consider Centex's
timely filed Motion for Fees under Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3) (2012).  However, we must vacate
the 11/24/14 Order Granting Fees as a nullity because the order
was filed more than ninety (90) days after Centex filed its
Motion for Fees.  At the time Centex's Motion for Fees was
pending, HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provided, in relevant part:
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS.  If
any party files a timely motion for . . . attorney's fees or
costs, the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended
until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the
motion; provided, that the failure to dispose of any motion
by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the
date of the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of
the motion.
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(Emphasis added.)  Centex's motion for fees was filed on August
5, 2014.  The circuit court's November 24, 2014 order was filed
111 days later.  Although Centex's appeal from the 11/24/14 Order
Granting Fees was timely, see Ass'n of Condominium Homeowners of
Tropics at Waikele v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai #i 254, 256, 318 P.3d 94,
96 (2013), the circuit court's 11/24/14 Order Granting Fees is
deemed denied for having been filed more than ninety days after
the motion for fees was filed.  See Cty. Of Hawaii v. C & J Coupe
Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai #i 352, 367-368, 198 P.3d 615, 630-
631 (2008).
Given the above, we need not address the parties'
points of error related to the attorneys' fees issues.  Instead,
we remand for further proceedings regarding attorneys' fees.  Id.
at 368, 198 P.3d at 631; Int'l Union of Painters and Allied
Trades, Painters Local Union 1791, AFL-CIO v. Endo Painting
Serv., Inc., Nos. CAAP-12-0000661, CAAP-12-0001094, CAAP-13-
0000187, 2015 WL 3649836 at *5 (Hawai# i App. Jun. 10, 2015)
(remanding case to allow party to reassert its claim for
attorneys' fees and costs without prejudice, where prior order
granting attorneys' fees and costs was deemed denied due to order
being filed more than ninety days after the motion). 
III.Conclusion 
Based on the above, in CAAP-14-0001036, we affirm the
"Order Granting Respondent Centex Homes' Motion for an Order to
Confirm Final Arbitration Award in the Arbitration by and between
Centex Homes and Respondent RNI-N.V., LP" and the "Order Denying
Petitioners' Motion to Vacate Final Arbitration Award," both
filed on July 16, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
In CAAP-14-0001373, we vacate the circuit court's
"Order Granting Respondent Centex Homes' Motion for Award of
Reasonable Attorney's Fees and Costs Incurred in Confirming Final
Arbitration Award in the Arbitration by and between Centex Homes
and Petitioner RNI-N.V., L.P.," filed on November 24, 2014.  The
"Supplemental Final Judgment" filed on December 4, 2014, is also
vacated.
