APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
Plaintiff-Appellant Ellen Shiraki ( Shiraki) appeals
from a July 8, 2014 Final Judgment of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit  (circuit court ).1
On appeal, Shiraki contends the circuit court:
(1) erred in granting Defendant-Appellee Hipawai
Corporation's ( Hipawai) Motion for Summary Judgment because
Shiraki had standing to bring her lawsuit based on Hipawai's
violations of the Fire Code of the City and County of Honolulu
(Honolulu Fire Code ); and
(2) abused its discretion in awarding Hipawai'sNOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER
§12-45.2-92 of the State Fire Code provides as follows:2
§12-45.2-92 Required water supply for fire protection .
Section 18.3.1 is amended to read as follows: "A water
supply approved by the county, capable of supplying the
required fire flow for fire protection shall be provided to
all premises upon which facilities or buildings, or portions
thereof, are hereafter constructed, or moved into or within
the county.  When any portion of the facility or building is
in excess of 150 feet (45 720 mm) from a water supply on a
fire apparatus access road, as measured by an approved route
around the exterior of the facility or building, on-site
fire hydrants and mains capable of supplying the required
fire flow shall be provided when required by the [authority
having jurisdiction ( AHJ)].  For on-site fire hydrant
requirements see section 18.3.3.
EXCEPTIONS:
1.When facilities or buildings, or portions
thereof, are completely protected with an

2attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 607-14.5 (Supp. 2014) because summary judgment was
inappropriate, and because Shiraki's claims were not frivolous or
groundless.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
Shiraki's appeal is without merit.
Shiraki's December 30, 2011 Complaint against Hipawai
alleged Hipawai was in violation Section 12-45.1-26 of the
Honolulu Fire Code in that the six buildings on the Hipawai
property were not "located within 150 feet 'from a water
supply'[;] which [could] be used to fight a fire to protect the
lives and properties on the Hipawai [property]" and the adjacent
properties of Shiraki and others.
At the time Shiraki filed her Complaint there was no
Section 12-45.1-26 of the Honolulu Fire Code.  There had been a
Section 12-45.1-26 of the State of Hawai #i Fire Code ( State Fire
Code), but that had been repealed January 1, 2010.
Section 12-45.2-92  of the State Fire Code was adopted,2NOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER

approved automatic fire sprinkler system,
the provisions of section 18.3.1 may be
modified by the AHJ.
2.When water supply requirements cannot be
installed due to topography or other
conditions, the AHJ may require additional
fire protection as specified in section
18.3.2, as amended in this code.
3.When there are not more than two
dwellings, or two private garages,
carports, sheds and agricultural
Occupancies, the requirements of section
18.3.1 may be modified by the AHJ."
[Eff JAN 01 2010]
(Auth: HRS §132-3)(Imp: HRS § 132-3)
3effective January 1, 2010 and replaced Section 12-45.1-26, but
Section 12-45.2-92 only applied to facilities or buildings, or
portions thereof, that were constructed after January 1, 2010. 
The Hipawai buildings were constructed in the 1960s.  The prior
Section 12-45.1-26, effective November 30, 2001 and repealed
effective January 1, 2010, also did not apply to facilities or
buildings, or portions thereof, that were constructed prior to
its effective date, November 30, 2001.
There was no Honolulu Fire Code or State Fire Code 150
foot water supply requirement that applied to the Hipawai
property.  Shiraki cited no other authority other than the one
repealed, the previously inapplicable Section 12-45.1-26 of the
State Fire Code, and later, in this appeal, the inapplicable
Section 12-45.2-92 of the State Fire Code.
Therefore, the circuit court did not err in entering
summary judgment against Shiraki.  Similarly, the circuit court
did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees and costs pursuant
to HRS § 607-14.5 as Shiraki's Complaint was "frivolous" and "not
reasonably supported by facts and law."  Additionally, pursuant
to HRS § 607-14.5, Hipawai had requested in writing that Shiraki
drop her frivolous lawsuit, because Hipawai's property was not in
violation of any Fire Code in that the buildings had been
constructed more than 50 years ago.NOT F OR P UBLICATIO N IN WEST'S H AWAI #I REP ORTS  AND PACIF IC REP ORTER

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that July 8, 2014 Final Judgment
of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
