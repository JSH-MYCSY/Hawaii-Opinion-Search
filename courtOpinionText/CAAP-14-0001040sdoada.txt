STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
KYE WAN CHAMBLESS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-00488)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Chan, JJ.)
 
The State of Hawai' i (State) charged Defendant-
Appellant Kye Wan Chambless (Chambless) with operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) (Count 1); and refusal to submit to breath, blood, or urine test (Refusal to Submit to Testing) (Count 2). After a bench trial, the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court)
1 found Chambless 
guilty as charged on both counts. 
1The Honorable Alvin K. Nishimura presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Chambless appeals from the District Court's Judgment 
entered on July 8, 2014. On appeal, Chambless contends that: (1) 
the Refusal to Submit to Testing charge was defective; (2) the OVUII charge was defective; (3) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance; (4) the District Court failed to obtain a valid waiver of her right to testify pursuant to Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai' i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995); (5) her Refusal to 
Submit to Testing conviction must be reversed because the statutes on which it was based are unconstitutional; (6) without Officer Jolon Wagner's inadmissible opinion testimony, there was insufficient evidence to convict her of OVUII; (7) there was insufficient evidence to show that she was under the influence of "alcohol" as that term is defined by statute; and (8) there was insufficient evidence to support her Refusal to Submit to Testing conviction. We reverse Chambless' conviction for Refusal to Submit to Testing, and we vacate Chambless' OVUII conviction and remand the case for a new trial on the OVUII charge. 
I.
 
We resolve Chambless' points of error as follows.
 
A.
 
Based on the analysis in the Hawai' i Supreme Court's 
decision in State v. Won, 137 Hawai' i 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015), 
we conclude that the State was precluded from prosecuting Chambless for Refusal to Submit to Testing. State v. Wilson, No. 
CAAP-15-0000682, 2018 WL 564771, at *1-8 (Hawai' i App. Jan. 26, 
2018). We therefore reverse Chambless' Refusal to Submit to Testing conviction. Accordingly, we need not specifically address Chambless' points of error 1, 5, and 8. 
B.
 
Chambless contends that the OVUII charge was defective 
for failing to define the term "alcohol." This contention is without merit. State v. Tsujimura, 137 Hawai' i 117, 120-21, 366 
P.3d 173, 176-77 (App. 2016) (holding that an OVUII charge was not defective for failing to allege the statutory definition of 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"alcohol"), vacated on other grounds, 140 Hawai' i 299, 400 P.3d 
500 (2017). 
Chambless also argues that there was insufficient 
evidence to show that she was under the influence of "alcohol" 
because the statutory definition of alcohol only encompasses alcohol that is the product of distillation. We also rejected this argument in Tsujimura. Id. at 121-22, 366 P.3d at 177-78, 
vacated on other grounds, 140 Hawai' i 299, 400 P.3d 500 (2017). 
C.
 
Chambless contends that her trial counsel provided
 
ineffective assistance in failing to object to Officer Wagner's
 opinion testimony that she showed numerous signs of impairment
 based on her performance on the field sobriety tests. Chambless
 contends that her counsel should have objected on the ground that
 a proper foundation had not been laid to show that Officer Wagner
 was qualified to render an opinion as to her impairment based on
 his assessment of the field sobriety tests. Chambless also
 argues that without this opinion testimony, there was
 insufficient evidence to support her OVUII conviction. We
 conclude that Chambless is not entitled to relief on these
 claims.
 
Assuming arguendo that the State failed to lay a
 
sufficient foundation regarding Officer Wagner's qualifications
 to render an opinion as to Chambless' impairment based on his
 assessment of the field sobriety tests, the failure of Chambless'
 counsel to object on this ground did not affect Chambless'
 substantial rights. Regardless of whether Officer Wagner was
 qualified to render such an opinion, it was permissible for him
 to testify about his observations regarding Chambless' physical
 performance on the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests. State
 
v. Ferrer, 95 Hawai' i 409, 426-47, 23 P.3d 744, 761-61 (App. 
2001). Officer Wagner's testimony about Chambless' actions in performing these two tests provided evidence that she was impaired. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Officer Wagner testified that on the walk-and-turn
 
test, Chambless was unable to maintain her stance during the
 
instructions, started too soon, raised her arms to keep her
 balance, and did not take the correct number of steps. On the
 one-leg stand test, Officer Wagner observed that Chambless swayed
 from side to side and raised her arms. In addition, the State
 presented testimony that Chambless was driving at night without
 her headlights on while entering the freeway;
2 Chambless told the
 
officer who stopped her that she had been drinking; Chambless'
 eyes were red and watery; and her vehicle smelled of alcohol.
 
We conclude that Chambless has not established her
 
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. With respect to
 Chambless' insufficiency of evidence claim, the general rule is
 that "evidence to which no objection has been made may properly
 be considered by the trier of fact and its admission will not
 constitute ground for reversal." State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563,
 
570, 617 P.2d 820, 826 (1980). Moreover, even without Officer
 Wagner's opinion testimony regarding Chambless' impairment based
 on his assessment of the field sobriety tests, there was
 sufficient evidence to support her OVUII conviction. 
D.
 
Chambless contends that the District Court failed to 
obtain a valid waiver of her right to testify because its end-of­trial Tachibana advisements were defective. The State argues that because of the short duration between the pretrial and end­of-trial advisements, the District Court's pretrial advisements served to compensate for the deficiencies in the District Court's end-of-trial advisements. However, in State v. Eduwensuyi, SCWC­16-0000558, 2018 WL 460089, at *7 (Hawai' i Jan. 18, 2018), the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court found this reasoning to be "inherently 
problematic." We conclude that the District Court failed to obtain a valid waiver of Chambless' right to testify and that 
2The District Court found that Chambless' entering the
freeway without her lights on showed that her ability to care for
herself and guard against casualty were impaired.

this error was not harmless. 
II.
 
Based on the foregoing, we reverse the District Court's
Judgment with respect to Count 2. We vacate the District Court's
Judgment with respect to Count 1, and we remand the case for a
 new trial on that count.
