CAAP-14-0001041
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LANCE M. NAKASONE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-01550)
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Lance M. Nakasone (Nakasone) was
 
found guilty, after a bench trial, of operating a vehicle under
 
the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) by the District Court of
 the First Circuit (District Court).
1 The District Court also
 
found that Nakasone committed the traffic infraction of speeding.
 Nakasone appeals from the Judgment on his OVUII conviction and
 sentence, which was entered by the District Court on July 14,
 2014. 
On appeal, Nakasone contends that his OVUII conviction 
should be vacated because: (1) the District Court failed to properly advise him of his right to testify pursuant to State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai
'i 292, 12 P.3d 1233 (2000), and Tachibana v. 
State, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995); and (2) the District 
1The Honorable David W. Lo presided. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Court's colloquy regarding trial stipulations was defective under 
State v. Murray, 116 Hawai 'i 3, 169 P.3d 955 (2007).2 
We conclude that the District Court erred in failing to 
properly advise Nakasone of his rights as required by Tachibana. In particular, the District Court failed to advise Nakasone that if he wanted to testify, no one could prevent him from doing so. See Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. 
Nakasone did not testify and we cannot say that the District Court's error was harmless. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 
279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (App. 2000). 
In light of our resolution of Nakasone's Tachibana
 
claim, we need not address the other arguments he raises on
 appeal. We vacate the District Court's Judgment and remand the
 case for a new trial on the OVUII charge.

for Plaintiff-Appellee
 
2The District Court entered separate judgments on Nakasone's
OVUII conviction and his traffic infraction for speeding.
Nakasone did not appeal from the judgment entered on his speeding
infraction. Accordingly, the District Court's adjudication of
Nakasone's speeding infraction is not before this court, and we
do not address, and Nakasone is not entitled to relief on, his
claim that his "speeding infraction judgment must be vacated."
