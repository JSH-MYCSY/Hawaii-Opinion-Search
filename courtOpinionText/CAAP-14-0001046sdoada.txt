IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LEWIS DANIEL KENDALL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DCC-14-0003244)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise, J., with
Ginoza, J., concurring and dissenting separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lewis Daniel Kendall (Kendall), 
pro
 
se, appeals from the July 9, 2014 Judgment entered by the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District
 Court).
1
 
Kendall was convicted of Criminal Littering, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 708-829(1) (2014).
 
On appeal, Kendall contends (1) the District Court
 
erred by denying him the opportunity to make a closing argument,
 (2) the District Court failed to obtain a valid waiver of his
 right to counsel and (3) HRS ยง 708-829 does not encompass
 recreational bird feeding, is unconstitutionally void for
 vagueness as applied to his case, or should be construed pursuant
 to the rule of lenity.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kendall's points of error as follows:
 
The State concedes that the District Court erred by 
failing to personally colloquy Kendall about his right to an attorney prior to trial and that it erred by refusing to allow Kendall to make a closing argument. However, a confession of error by the prosecution must be confirmed by our independent review of the record and be well-founded in the law and must be properly preserved and prejudicial. State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai
'i 
333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000), quoting State v. Wasson, 76 Hawai
'i 415, 418, 879 P.2d 520, 523 (1994). We agree with the 
State that Kendall's right to present a closing argument under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated in this case. State v. Herbert, 110 Hawai
'i 284, 288, 
132 P.3d 852, 856 (App. 2006) (citing Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853 (1975)). The District Court denied Kendall's request to
 make a closing argument and by doing so, the District Court
 prevented Kendall from making his legal arguments.
 
We also agree with the State that the District Court 
failed to ascertain whether Kendall validly waived his right to counsel. "Since the right to counsel is fundamental in our judicial system, where a defendant elects to proceed pro se, the record must indicate that he was offered counsel but that he voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently rejected the offer and waived that right." State v. Dickson, 4 Haw. App. 614, 619, 673 
P.2d 1036, 1041 (1983) (citing Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975)). "Courts will not presume acquiescence in the deprivation of such a fundamental right, nor will waiver be presumed from the echoes of a silent record." Id. "The trial 
court is initially charged with the function of assuring that the defendant's wavier of counsel is made knowingly and intelligently and that the record is complete so as to reflect that waiver." Id. Structural defects such as lack of defense counsel are never 
harmless. State v. Suka, 79 Hawai
'i 293, 298-99, 901 P.2d 1272, 
1277-78 (App. 1995) (overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Holbron, 80 Hawai
'i 27, 32, n.12, 904 P.2d 912, 917, n.12 
(1995)). The record on appeal does not reflect that Kendall was

informed of his right to counsel or that he knowingly,
 
voluntarily, and intelligently waived that right before
 proceeding to trial without counsel. Therefore, Kendall's right
 to counsel was violated.
 
(3) As to his remaining point of error, although
 
couched in terms of a challenge to the validity of the Criminal
 Littering statute as applied to his conduct, Kendall also argues
 that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. 
To prove the offense of Criminal Littering, the prosecution was
 required to present substantial evidence that Kendall "knowingly
 place[d], thr[ew], or drop[ped] litter on any public or private
 property[.]" HRS ยง 708-829(1) (emphasis added). There was
 undisputed evidence that before a deputy sheriff intervened, the
 rice and bread Kendall had placed on the ground to feed the birds
 was being "actively eat[en]" by the birds and was being consumed
 "almost immediately[.]" We conclude that in this case, the State
 failed to introduce substantial evidence to prove that Kendall
 knowingly placed, threw, or dropped litter on the property.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 9, 2014
 
Judgment entered by the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division, is reversed.
