Judgment entered by the District Court of the Third Circuit

(District Court)  on August 20, 2014.
I.

 
On appeal, Ayau contends that: (1) the District Court 
failed to obtain a valid waiver of his right to testify as 
required by Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995); and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. 
II.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) concedes 
that the District Court failed to obtain a valid waiver from Ayau of his right to testify as required by Tachibana. We agree with this concession as the District Court failed to determine whether Ayau understood his right to testify. Ayau did not testify, and we cannot say that the District Court's error was harmless. See 
State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 279, 12 P.3d 371, 379 (App. 
2000). Accordingly, Ayau is entitled to a new trial on the OVLSR-OVUII charge. 
III.
 
Ayau contends that the State presented insufficient
 
evidence to show that he acted with a reckless state of mind with
 respect to whether his license was revoked or suspended for
 operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant at the
 time he operated his vehicle. We disagree.
 
A.
 
The State presented the following evidence at trial:
 
On September 28, 2013, Ayau was arrested for operating
 
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII). At that
 time, he was given a Notice of Administrative Revocation (Notice
 of Revocation), which advised him that he had a temporary permit
 to drive for 30 days; that within eight days of his arrest, the
 Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office (ADLRO) would
 conduct an administrative review of the Notice of Revocation and

would mail its decision to him; that if the review decision was
 
to not revoke his license, his license would be returned to him;
 that if the review decision was to revoke his license, he had six
 days to request an administrative hearing to review that
 decision. The ADLRO issued a Notice of Administrative Review
 Decision which sustained the administrative revocation of Ayau's
 license and revoked his license from October 29, 2013, to October
 29, 2014. The Notice of Administrative Review Decision was
 mailed to Ayau on October 2, 2013.
 
On February 19, 2014, Ayau was driving a car when he
 
was pulled over by Officer Joseph Picadura. Officer Picadura
 testified at trial that Ayau was not able to produce his driver's
 license and told Officer Picadura that "his driver's license was
 taken away from a DUI in 2013." The State also introduced into
 evidence the citation issued by Officer Picadura to Ayau, on
 which Officer Picadura wrote that "[Ayau] stated he did not have
 his driver's license because it was taken away from a D.U.I. in
 September 2013." On cross-examination, Officer Picadura
 testified that Ayau also said that he was "in the process of
 getting his driver's license back." The State introduced
 certified government records showing that Ayau's license remained
 revoked on February 19, 2014, when he was cited by Officer
 Picadura.
 
B.
 
When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, 
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to show that Ayau acted with a reckless state of mind. In other words, that he consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his driver's license was revoked or suspended for OVUII when he operated his vehicle on February 19, 2014. See State v. Lioen, 
106 Hawai
'i 123, 131-32, 102 P.3d 367, 375-76 (App. 2004). The 
evidence showed that upon Ayau's arrest for OVUII on September 28, 2013, he was served with the Notice of Revocation which advised him that he had a temporary license for 30 days, that his license would be returned if it was not administratively revoked,

and of the procedures that would apply if his license was
 
revoked. Ayau's license was administratively revoked for OVUII
 from October 29, 2013, to October 29, 2014, and his license was
 not returned to him. When he was stopped on February 19, 2014,
 Ayau did not have a driver's license, and he admitted that the
 reason he did have a license was that it had been taken away
 because of his "D.U.I. in September 2013." Ayau also told
 Officer Picadura that he was "in the process of getting his
 driver's license back." A reasonable inference that could be
 drawn from this statement is that Ayau knew his license remained
 revoked, that is, his statement of being in the process of
 getting his license back meant that he knew the process of his
 license being reinstated had not been completed. Under these
 circumstances, we conclude that the State presented sufficient
 evidence that Ayau acted with a reckless state of mind to support
 his OVLSR-OVUII conviction.
 
IV.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the District Court's
 
Amended Judgment, and we remand the case for a new trial on the
 OVLSR-OVUII charge.
