IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
ANTHONY ROBERT LEOFFLER, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0002K; CR. NO. 03-1-0221K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Anthony Robert Leoffler (Leoffler)
 
appeals from the Order Dismissing Petitioner's Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 from Custody (Order Dismissing Petition), entered on July 18,
 
2014, by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).
1
 
The Circuit Court dismissed Leoffler's November 6, 2013 Petition
 
to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody (Petition) because the Hawaii Paroling
 
Authority (HPA) scheduled a new minimum-term hearing, which
 
rendered his claims moot. 
On appeal, Leoffler argues that the Circuit Court erred 
in dismissing his Petition without a hearing, in violation of 
Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40(f).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Leoffler's appeal is without merit.
 
On January 14, 2005, after a minimum-term hearing, the
 
HPA issued a Notice and Order Fixing Minimum Term(s) of
 Imprisonment, setting Leoffler's level of punishment at Level III
 based on the following significant factors: (1) Nature of
 Offense and (2) Degree of Loss to Person. The HPA fixed
 Leoffler's minimum prison term at eighteen years. 
On November 6, 2013, Leoffler filed his Petition.
2 He
 
asserted that the HPA arbitrarily and capriciously deviated from
 its own sentencing Guidelines for Establishing Minimum Terms of
 Imprisonment in classifying him as a Level III offender without
 providing a rationale; violated his due process rights by
 imposing a minimum term without disclosing the adverse
 information in its file far enough in advance of the hearing to
 give him a meaningful opportunity to respond; violated his rights
 under the Sixth Amendment by finding he had a callous or cruel
 state of mind, which was greater than state of mind required by
 the offense; and failed to announce his minimum term in his or
 his counsel's presence and/or hold the minimum-term hearing
 publicly. Leoffler asked the Circuit Court to vacate, set aside,
 or correct the Judgment. 
On April 14, 2014, after the parties stipulated to two
 
extensions of time to answer the Petition, the State filed its
 Answer. The State asserted that, after Leoffler filed the
 Petition, the HPA agreed to grant him a new minimum-term hearing. 
The State attached a Declaration of the HPA administrator, who
 stated that the HPA agreed to grant Leoffler a new minimum-term
 hearing in light of this court's memorandum opinion in St. Clair
 v. State, CAAP-11-0000359, 2013 WL 6762256 (App. Dec. 20, 2013)

 Leoffler filed the Petition in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit, and it was transferred to the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.

(Mem). The State also moved to dismiss the Petition without a
 
hearing because the issues raised therein were moot. 
The HPA held a new minimum-term hearing on June 25,
 
2014, and on July 2, 2014, issued a Notice and Order of Fixing
 Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment. The HPA again fixed Leoffler's
 minimum term at eighteen years and set his level of punishment at
 Level III. However, this time, the HPA based the level of
 punishment on the following significant factors: (1) Nature of
 Offense, (2) Character and Attitude of Offender with Respect to
 Criminal Activity or Lifestyle, and (3) Efforts Made to Live Pro-
Social Life Prior to Commitment to Prison. 
On July 18, 2014, citing to Coulter v. State, 116 
Hawai
'i 181, 172 P.3d 493 (2007), the Circuit Court issued the 
Order Dismissing Petition on the ground that the HPA's scheduling of a new minimum-term hearing rendered the issues raised in the Petition moot. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in 
dismissing the Petition. The HPA's granting of Leoffler's request for a new minimum-term hearing rendered his claims moot without exception. See Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai
'i 307, 
312, 141 P.3d 480, 485 (2006). 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's July 18, 2014 Order
 
Dismissing Petition is affirmed.
