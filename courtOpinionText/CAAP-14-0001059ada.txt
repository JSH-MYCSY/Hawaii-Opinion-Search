NO. CAAP-14-0001059 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2011-321 (2-10-46885))

 
OCTOBER 30, 2015
 
NAKAMURA, C.J., FOLEY AND GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Claimant-Appellant Robert G. Irving (Irving) appeals
 
from the July 17, 2014 "Order Denying Claimant's Motion to Modify
 
the Decision and Order dated June 16, 2014 and Motion for
 Attorney's Fees" of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 Board (LIRAB).
 
On appeal, Irving contends the LIRAB erred in: (1)
 
denying his June 26, 2014 "Motion to Modify the Decision and
 Order Dated June 16, 2014 and Motion for Attorney Fees" (Motion
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for Modification and Attorney Fees); (2) not designating
 
Employer-Appellee Ocean House Builders, dba Nan, Inc., and
 
Insurance Carrier-Appellee First Insurance Company of Hawaii,
 Ltd. (together, Employer) as cross-appellants; (3) not concluding
 
that Irving was the prevailing party on Employer's cross-appeal;
 
and (4) denying attorney fees to Irving pursuant to Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-93 (Supp. 2014).
I. BACKGROUND
1
 
Irving was employed as a safety officer trainee for
 
Nan, Inc. On October 25, 2010, Irving fell and sustained
 injuries to his left wrist in the form of a sprain, to his left
 elbow in the form of a lateral epicondylitis, and to his low back
 in the form of a strain. Employer denied liability for the
 injury.
 
On June 30, 2011, the Director of Labor and Industrial
 
Relations (Director) found that the October 25, 2010 incident
 
arose out of and in the course of Irving's employment. According
 
to the Director, "the [October 25, 2010] accident resulted in a
 temporary aggravation of [Irving's] pre-existing low back
 condition which resolved by April 18, 2011." The Director found
 the accident resulted in injuries to Irving's left wrist and left
 elbow, injuries which resolved as of February 14, 2011. The
 Director awarded medical care, services, and supplies up to
 February 14, 2011 for the left wrist and left elbow, and up to
 April 18, 2011 for the low back.
 
On July 18, 2011, Irving appealed the Director's
 
decision "solely as it relates to the issue of limitation of
 temporary total disability and/or treatment received after April
 18, 2011 and that [Irving] had no permanent disability or
 disfigurement resulting from the [October 25, 2010] accident."
 The LIRAB scheduled an initial conference on October 14, 2011. 
At the conference, Employer raised the additional issue for
 appeal of whether Irving sustained a personal injury arising out

Fact which are undisputed on appeal.

   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of and in the course of employment on October 25, 2010.2
 
On June 16, 2014, the LIRAB issued its Decision and
 
Order. The LIRAB clarified the issues on appeal:
 
a.	 Whether [Irving] sustained a personal injury
involving his left wrist, left elbow, and low
back on October 25, 2010, arising out of and in
the course of employment.
 
b.	 Whether Employer is liable for, and [Irving] is
entitled to, medical care, services and supplies
for his left wrist and left elbow after February
14, 2011 and for his low back after April 18,
2011.
 
c. 	Whether [Irving] sustained any permanent partial
disability as a result of the work injury of
October 25, 2010. If so, what is the extent of
permanent partial disability.
 
The LIRAB concluded:
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. . . . .
 
Given the foregoing, the [LIRAB] concludes that
[Irving] sustained a personal injury involving his
left wrist, left elbow, and low back on October 25,
2010, arising out of and in the course of employment.
 
. . . .
 
2. With regard to the question of whether
Employer is liable for, and [Irving] entitled to,
medical care, services and supplies for his left wrist
and left elbow after February 14, 2011 and for his low
back after April 18, 2011, the [LIRAB] concludes that
such issue cannot be determined at this time. 
. . . .
 
3. The [LIRAB] concludes that [Irving] did not
sustain any permanent partial disability as a result
of the work injury of October 25, 2010. [Irving's]
left wrist, left elbow, and low back conditions
resolved without any permanent impairment or permanent
disability.
 
Irving filed his Motion for Modification and Attorney
 
Fees on June 26, 2014. The LIRAB denied the motions on July 17,
 
2014.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. 	Administrative Rulings
 
HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 Repl.) provides:

 Although a transcript of the pretrial conference is not contained
in the record on appeal, this fact is undisputed by Employer.

(g)	 Upon review of the record the court may affirm
the decision of the agency or remand the case
with instructions for further proceedings; or it
may reverse or modify the decision and order if
the substantial rights of the petitioners may
have been prejudiced because the administrative
findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or
 
statutory provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
(5) 	Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record; or 
(6) 	Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion.

plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the underlying legislative 
purpose." Iida, 86 Hawai 'i at 396, 935 P.2d at 111 (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Int'l Bhd. Of Elec. Workers, Local 1357 v. Hawaiian Tel. Co., 68 Haw. 316, 322, 713 P.2d 943, 950 (1986)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Designating Employer as Cross-Appellant
 
Irving's first and second points of error address the
 
same issue: whether the LIRAB erred in denying Irving's request
 to designate Employer as a cross-appellant.
3 Therefore, this
 
court addresses these points of error together. 
Irving argues that by raising a new issue on appeal
 
without going through the appeal procedures under HRS § 386-87
 (1993), Employer became a cross-appellant, and should have been
 designated as such by the LIRAB. Denying Irving's request to
 designate Employer as a cross-appellant, the LIRAB stated, "There
 being no specific rule, the [LIRAB] has routinely accepted and
 decided issues raised by non-appealing claimants and non-
appealing employers, without designating such party as a cross-
appellant."
 
Irving admits on appeal, "[t]he issue of the Hawaii
 
[LIRAB] allowing a non-appealing party to raise an additional
 issue at a Pretrial Conference and not designate that issue as a
 cross-appeal does not appear to have been specifically addressed
 by either the [LIRAB] or any of the Courts in Hawaii."
 
The Director is tasked with making rules "which the
 
director deems necessary for or conducive to its proper
 
3
 Irving's opening brief fails to make a discernible argument as to
his first point of appeal, mentioning only, "On June 26, 2014 ROBERT IRVING
filed his [Motion For Modification and Attorney Fees] to have the Employerlisted as a Cross-Appellant as to the new issue it raised during the initialPretrial Conference, and that he be awarded attorney fees as the prevailingparty, pursuant to HRS § 386-93." Our policy, however, is to afford"litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, wherepossible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 173,
180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu,77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)). Here, Irving's first point on
appeal regarding his Motion For Modification and Attorney Fees to haveEmployer listed as a cross-appellant is substantively the same as his secondpoint on appeal challenging the LIRAB's decision not to list Employer as across-appellant, so we are able to address his first point of error based onarguments made in his second point of error.

application and enforcement." HRS § 386-72 (Supp. 2014). As a 
body of an administrative agency, the LIRAB is not bound by the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), except to the extent 
that existing LIRAB rules provide. See HRCP Rule 1 ("These rules 
govern the procedure in the circuit courts of the State in all suits of a civil nature . . . .") (emphasis added)). 
Since the Director has not promulgated any applicable 
rule regarding the procedure for designating a party as a cross-appellant and Irving has not argued that any other procedural rule applies, this court cannot find that the LIRAB's decision to not designate Employer as a cross-appellant was made upon any unlawful procedure. See Potter, 89 Hawai
'i at 422, 974 P.2d at 
62; see also HRS § 91-14(g).
B. Irving's Entitlement to Attorney Fees under HRS § 386-93(b)
 
With respect to his third and fourth points of error,
 
Irving argues that: (1) for purposes of awarding attorney fees
 
pursuant to HRS §386-93(b), Employer "effectively appealed" the
 Director's decision that Irving sustained work-related injuries
 on October 25, 2010 by seeking LIRAB's review of this issue at
 the pretrial conference; (2) he was the prevailing party on this
 issue; and (3) therefore, the LIRAB erred in denying his request
 for attorney fees under HRS § 386-93(b).
1. Application of HRS § 386-93
 
Irving argues that Employer, at the pretrial
 
conference, sought the LIRAB's review of the Director's decision
 that Irving sustained personal injury on October 25, 2010 arising
 out of and in the course of employment and by doing so,
 effectively appealed this decision of the Director. Irving
 contends that since Employer raised an additional issue to the
 LIRAB and lost on the issue, the LIRAB should have found Irving
 to be a prevailing party and awarded him attorney fees pursuant
 to HRS § 386-93(b).
 
HRS § 386-93(b) states: "If an employer appeals a
 
decision of the director or appellate board, the costs of the
 proceedings of the appellate board or the appellate court,
 together with reasonable attorney's fees, shall be assessed
 against the employer if the employer loses[.]" This court has
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
previously examined the legislative intent behind HRS § 386-93(b) 
in Iida, where we explained:
 
In our opinion, the legislature's intent in
enacting HRS § 386-93(b), in its simplest form, was to
compel employers to shoulder the costs of unsuccessful
appeals from workers' compensation decisions, while
simultaneously easing the financial burden of
claimants who must expend time and resources
responding to unsuccessful appeals. One goal of the
provision is to discourage appeals by employers.
Unlike HRS § 386-93(a), which allows costs to be taxed
against any party for frivolous appeals, HRS § 386­93(b) places the burden solely on the employer if the
employer loses, regardless of the meritorious nature
of the appeal. The legislature clearly intended to
add an element of risk to any appeal undertaken by an
employer. This element of risk, coupled with the
different manner in which the legislature addresses
appeals by employers and employees, is palpable
evidence of the policy to blunt the willingness of
employers to appeal decisions of the Director or
LIRAB.
 
Another policy underlying HRS § 386-93(b), which
buttresses the beneficient purpose of the workers'
compensation statute, is the element of fairness.
Employers are typically better able to handle the
costs of both defending and appealing a claim for
workers' compensation benefits than employees on the
other side of the table. We believe the legislature
recognized the comparative financial disparities
between employers and employees in this context. An
 employee seeking workers' compensation benefits is,
under most circumstances, unemployed. Hence, as a
general matter, the costs of proceedings present an
onerous burden for employees. It would be inherently
inequitable to force an already burdened worker (or
his or her dependents) to twice expend funds
successfully litigating a claim for workers'
compensation. Fairness dictates, then, that employers
both assume the risk and ultimately pay for the costs
associated with unsuccessful appeals.
 
Iida, 84 Hawai 'i at 403, 935 P.2d at 118. We addressed in Iida 
the novel issue of whether an employer who withdraws its claim on
 
appeal is an unsuccessful party for purposes of attorney fees. 
Id. at 403-05, 935 P.2d at 118-20. We concluded:
 
Holding employers liable for the costs of defending
conceded issues or entire claims under the provisions
of HRS § 386-93(b) certainly discourages weak appeals.
It also reinforces the intent of the legislature by
placing the burden of paying for unsuccessful appeals
where it belongs on the party with the poorly thought
out, hastily conceived appeal, who can more readily
absorb the costs of the appeal. It will also
 discourage vexatious litigation and the use of
discovery, depositions, motions, and appearances to
either harass employees or extract unnecessary
expenditures from a party already facing dire
financial straits. 

Id. at 405, 935 P.2d at 120 (internal citation omitted). Taking
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
into consideration the purpose of the statute, we held that "if
 
the employer appeals and later concedes, the employer loses." 
Id. We noted, "[t]his interpretation of HRS § 386-93(b) is in
 
line with the oft-stated beneficent purpose of the workers'
 compensation statute and affords a 'liberal construction in favor
 of the employee[.]'" Id. (quoting Respicio v. Waialua Sugar Co.,
 
67 Haw. 16, 18, 675 P.2d 770, 772 (1984)).
 
With this understanding of the legislature's intent
 
behind HRS § 386-93(b), we turn to the question of whether an
 employer who is permitted to challenge a decision of the Director
 before the LIRAB without having appealed pursuant to the
 procedures under HRS § 386-87 may be viewed as having appealed
 for purposes of the award of attorney fees under HRS § 386-93(b).
 
If Employer had filed an appeal of the Director's
 
decision that Irving had sustained a work-related injury on
 October 25, 2010, Irving would clearly have been entitled to
 attorney fees under HRS § 386-93(b) because Employer lost the
 issue of whether Irving had sustained a work injury on October
 25, 2010 before the LIRAB. However, because Employer was
 permitted to raise the issue at a pretrial conference, the LIRAB
 denied Irving's motion for attorney fees on the basis that
 Employer did not file an appeal.
 
The first goal of HRS § 386-93(b) we identified in Iida 
was "to discourage appeals by employers." Iida, 84 Hawai
'i at 
403, 935 P.2d at 118. Here, the element of risk that accompanies a direct appeal to the LIRAB is undermined when an employer can avoid an award of attorney fees by simply piggybacking its point of appeal onto an employee's appeal. 
The second goal we identified was fairness as it
 
relates to the comparative financial disparities between
 employers and employees. Id. It advances this second goal to
 
require an employer to pay costs and attorney fees incurred by an
 employee in defending against an employer's challenge to the
 Director's decision, when the employer is permitted to raise the
 challenge at a pretrial conference and then loses.
 
To hold that HRS § 386-93(b) does not apply to
 
employers who lose on a point of appeal they are permitted to
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
raise at a pretrial conference, would discourage employees from
 
appealing their claims to the LIRAB. It would raise fears on the
 part of employees that their employer could challenge aspects of
 the Director's decision favorable to the employee and not have to
 reimburse the employee for amounts the employee incurred in
 litigating these issues if the employer loses. Similarly, it may
 encourage employers to informally raise all of the issues on
 which they were unsuccessful before the Director at a LIRAB
 pretrial conference as a means of dissuading employees from
 pursuing appeals.
 
The LIRAB's holding on the issue of whether to apply 
HRS § 386-93(b) to Employer, where Employer was permitted to raise an issue challenging the Director's decision at a pretrial conference, is inconsistent with the legislative purpose of the statute. Therefore, the LIRAB's holding was in error. Iida, 86 
Hawai
'i at 396, 935 P.2d at 111. 
2. Prevailing Party Determination
 
There is no dispute that Employer lost before the LIRAB
 
on its challenge to the Director's decision that Irving sustained
 work-related injuries on October 25, 2010. The LIRAB concluded
 that "[Irving] sustained a personal injury involving his left
 wrist, left elbow, and low back on October 25, 2010, arising out
 of and in the course of employment." 
We conclude that because Employer lost on its challenge
 
to the Director's decision on the issue of whether Irving
 sustained work-related injuries on October 25, 2010, Irving was
 entitled, pursuant to HRS § 386-93(b), to the award of costs and
 reasonable attorney fees he incurred in defending against
 Employer's challenge to the Director's decision on this issue. 
On remand, the LIRAB shall award to Irving the costs and
 reasonable attorney fees he incurred in defending against 
Employer's challenge to the Director's decision. The LIRAB, to
 the extent practicable, shall base its award of costs and
 reasonable attorney fees on an apportionment between those 
incurred by Irving in defending against the Employer's challenge
 to the Director's decision and those incurred in pursing his own
 appeal, with Irving entitled to costs and reasonable attorney

fees attributable to his defense against the Employer's 
challenge. See TSA Intern. Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai 'i 
243, 264, 990 P.2d 713, 734 (1999).
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The July 17, 2014 "Order Denying Claimant's Motion to
 
Modify the Decision and Order dated June 16, 2014 and Motion for
 Attorney's Fees" of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals
 Board is vacated, and this case is remanded for a determination
 of reasonable attorney fees and costs to be awarded to Irving
 consistent with this Opinion.
