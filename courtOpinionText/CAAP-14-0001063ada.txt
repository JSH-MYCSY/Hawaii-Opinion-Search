NAKAMURA, C.J., FOLEY AND REIFURTH, JJ.
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J.
 
Defendants/Appellants/Cross-Appellees Frank O. Comito
 
and Linda A. Comito (together, Comitos) appeal from the: (1)
 
August 7, 2014 "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary
 
Judgment and Writ of Possession Filed May 13, 2014"; (2) August
 7, 2014 "Writ of Ejectment"; and (3) August 7, 2014 "Judgment for
 Ejectment" entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1
 
(circuit court).
 
On appeal, the Comitos contend the circuit court erred
 
in granting summary judgment and a writ of ejectment in favor of
 Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellant Bank of New York Mellon, as
 Trustee for the Certificateholders CWMBS, Inc., Alternative Loan
 Trust 2006-OA1 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006­OA1 (BNYM) after BNYM had transferred title of the property to
 
Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellee Blue Mountain
 
Homes, LLC (Blue Mountain) during the pendency of the ejectment
 
action, allegedly divesting BNYM of standing to pursue its
 
ejectment action.
 
BNYM cross-appeals from the "Order Denying Plaintiff's
 
Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Against [the
 Comitos], Filed August 22, 2014" entered on October 9, 2014 in
 the circuit court.
 
On cross-appeal, BNYM contends the circuit court erred
 
in denying BNYM's motion for attorneys' fees on jurisdictional
 grounds.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
The Comitos mortgaged their property to Home Loan
 
Capital Inc. (Home Loan Capital), and the mortgage was recorded
 
on January 20, 2006. Under the terms of the mortgage, Mortgage
 
Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) was the mortgagee
 
acting solely as nominee for Home Loan Capital.
 
BNYM purchased the property following a nonjudicial
 
foreclosure sale and recorded its quitclaim deed on April 21,
 
2010.
 
1
 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
BNYM filed an action for ejectment against the Comitos
 
on August 18, 2011. BNYM transferred its interest in the subject
 
property to Blue Mountain Homes, LLC (Blue Mountain) by special
 
warranty deed, recorded on May 14, 2013. On December 4, 2013,
 
Blue Mountain filed a motion to intervene on the basis that "any
 adjudication of this lawsuit will affect Blue Mountain's right
 and claim of superior title to the subject property at issue."
 
BNYM filed a motion for summary judgment on May 13,
 
2014. The circuit court orally granted the motion at the hearing
 on June 4, 2014. On August 7, 2014, the circuit court entered
 its order granting BNYM's motion for summary judgment, its writ
 of ejectment, and judgment for ejectment.
 
On August 19, 2014, the Comitos filed their notice of
 
appeal.
 
BNYM filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs, file
 
stamped on August 22, 2014. BNYM disputes the filing date,
 arguing that the motion was lodged with the circuit court on
 August 21, 2014.
 
On August 25, 2014, the circuit court granted Blue
 
Mountain's motion to intervene.
 
On October 9, 2014, the circuit court denied BNYM's
 
motion for attorneys' fees and costs.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Standing
 
"On appeal, the issue of standing is reviewed de novo 
under the right/wrong standard." Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai
'i 
176, 180, 145 P.3d 719, 723 (2006) (citing State ex rel. Office of Consumer Protection v. Honolulu Univ. of Arts, Sciences, and Humanities, 110 Hawai
'i 504, 513, 135 P.3d 113, 122 (2006)).
B. Jurisdiction
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing a
case where the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not
on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit court
without subject matter jurisdiction is void.

Lingle v. Hawai 'i Gov't Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 
107 Hawai 'i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting Amantiad 
v. Odum, 90 Hawai 'i 152, 158-59, 977 P.2d 160, 166-67 (1999)).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. BNYM's Standing to Continue Litigating Ejectment Action
 
The Comitos argue on appeal that BNYM did not have
 
title to the subject property because it had transferred title to
 
Blue Mountain before BNYM filed its motion for summary judgment,
 and thus BNYM could not establish an injury in fact necessary for
 standing.
 
BNYM argues in response that "[a]s the owner of the 
property, [BNYM] was entitled to sell the property to Blue Mountain; however, it continued to pursue its ejectment action and represented the interest of the new purchaser in doing so." BNYM argues it "was permitted to continue the action after the transfer in interest occurred under [Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule] 25(c); thus, there was no genuine issue 
regarding the participation of the real party in interest here, 
particularly when Blue Mountain ratified the action." 
HRCP Rule 25(c) states, "In case of any transfer of
 
interest, the action may be continued by or against the original
 party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom
 the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or
 joined with the original party."
2 BNYM transferred its interest
 
to Blue Mountain after BNYM filed its ejectment claim against the
 Comitos.
3 Therefore, to the extent that BNYM had title at the
 
time it filed the ejectment action, BNYM was permitted to file a
 motion for summary judgment on the merits of the ejectment action
 even after it had transferred the property to Blue Mountain. In
 addition, the Comitos do not dispute that Blue Mountain ratified
 BNYM's ejectment action.
 
2
 Instead of a motion for substitution, Blue Mountain filed a motion
to intervene under HRCP Rule 24(a). The circuit court granted the motion to
intervene on August 25, 2014. The motion to intervene did not deprive BNYM of
its ability to continue litigating the ejectment action.
 
3
 BNYM filed its complaint on August 18, 2011. BNYM transferred its
 
interest to Blue Mountain on May 6, 2013.
 
4
    
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Comitos do not contend that BNYM did not have 
standing to file the original ejectment action, and thus we do 
not address this argument. See Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed 
waived."). The Comitos' contention that BNYM lacks standing to 
pursue its claim is without merit.
B. Jurisdiction Over BNYM's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
On cross-appeal, BNYM argues the circuit court erred in
 
ruling that the filing of the Comitos' notice of appeal prior to
 
BNYM's post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees and costs
 divested the circuit court of jurisdiction over the motion for
 attorneys' fees and costs.
 
The circuit court relied heavily on the unpublished 
Hawai
'i Supreme Court decision in Krog v. Koahou, SCWC-12-0000315 
(Haw. Feb. 28, 2014) (mem.). Like the Comitos, the petitioners 
in Krog were subject to an ejection action following a 
nonjudicial foreclosure of their property. Id. at 1. The trial 
court granted the foreclosing party's motion for summary judgment at a hearing on December 21, 2011, and the order was entered on January 26, 2012. Id. On February 17, 2012, the petitioners 
filed a motion for stay pending appeal. Id. at 2. The 
foreclosing party opposed the motion on March 5, 2014, arguing that he was entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs, and did not file a separate motion for attorneys' fees and costs. Id. 
In Krog, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court held that the trial 
court lacked jurisdiction to award attorneys' fees because the foreclosing party failed to file a motion for the award of fees. Id. at 4. Because the trial court had awarded attorneys' fees 
and costs without having considered the motion pursuant to HRCP 
4
Rule 54,  the supreme court voided the award of attorneys' fees
4
 HRCP Rule 54 provides in relevant part:
 
Rule 54. JUDGMENTS; COSTS; ATTORNEYS' FEES.
 
. . . .
 
(continued...)
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for lack of jurisdiction. Id. at 6. Implicit in the supreme
 
court's finding was the understanding that a timely-filed HRCP
 Rule 54(d)(2) motion would have allowed the trial court to have
 retained jurisdiction to determine a motion for attorney's fees
 and costs. 
See id. at 6. 
Here, unlike the foreclosing party in Krog, BNYM filed
 
a timely motion for an award of attorneys' fees and costs
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d)(2). Therefore, the circuit court's
 reliance on Krog to find that it had no jurisdiction to hear
 BNYM's motion for attorneys' fees was misplaced. Because BNYM's
 motion for attorneys' fees and costs complied with HRCP Rule
 54(d)(2), the circuit court retained jurisdiction to determine
 whether BNYM was entitled to fees and costs. 
It is worth noting that this court has stated, 

4(...continued)
(d) Costs; attorneys' fees.
 
(1) COSTS OTHER THAN ATTORNEYS' FEES. Except
when express provision therefor is made either in a
statute or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as
of course to the prevailing party unless the court
otherwise directs; but costs against the State or a
county, or an officer or agency of the State or a
county, shall be imposed only to the extent permitted
by law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on 48 hours'
notice. On motion served within 5 days thereafter,
the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.
 
(2) ATTORNEYS' FEES.
 
(A) Claims for attorneys' fees and related
nontaxable expenses shall be made by motion unless the
substantive law governing the action provides for the
recovery of such fees as an element of damages to be
proved at trial.
 
(B) Unless otherwise provided by statute or
order of the court, the motion must be filed and
served no later than 14 days after the entry of an
appealable order or judgment; must specify the
judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds
entitling the moving party to the award; and must
state the amount or provide a fair estimate of the
amount sought. If directed by the court, the motion
shall also disclose the terms of any agreement with
respect to fees to be paid for the services for which
the claim is made.
 
(C) The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B)
do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as
sanctions for violations of rules. 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In civil cases where the party seeking attorney fees
or costs fails to (1) have included within the order or
judgment being appealed an award of costs and attorney fees,
5
or (2) comply with HRAP Rule 4(a)(3),  the following rule
applies:
 
While a case is on appeal, the lower court lacks
jurisdiction to decide any questions pertaining to attorney
fees arising out of or relating to the matter on appeal. 
French v. French, 110 Hawai 'i 399, 403-04, 133 P.3d 828, 832-33 
(App. 2006) (emphasis added and footnote altered). In this case,
 
the parties appear to have complied with HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), and
 therefore, the rule articulated in French does not apply.
6
 
We reverse the circuit court's decision denying the
 
motion for attorneys' fees and costs to the extent the circuit
 court found there was no jurisdiction because the motion had been
 filed after the notice of appeal. We remand to the circuit court
 to determine whether the motion was timely filed and if so,
 whether BNYM is entitled to attorneys' fees and costs.
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we affirm the (1) August 7, 2014 "Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Writ of
 Possession Filed May 13, 2014"; (2) August 7, 2014 "Writ of
 
5
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) provides:
 
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS. 
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or
order, or for attorney's fees or costs, the time for filing
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry
of an order disposing of the motion; provided, that the
failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed
shall constitute a denial of the motion. 
The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the
disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely
filed after entry of the judgment or order.
 
The 90-day period shall be computed as provided in
Rule 26 of these Rules.
 
6
 If BNYM filed its post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees and
costs on August 21, 2014, within fourteen days after entry of the August 7,
2014 judgment for possession under HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B), then BNYM would have
extended the thirty-day time period for filing a notice of appeal, and would
have extended the date by which a party could file a notice of appeal, as well
as the trial court's jurisdiction, to November 10, 2014. See HRAP Rule
 
4(a)(1) and (3).

Ejectment"; and (3) August 7, 2014 "Judgment for Ejectment"
 
entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. We vacate 
the August 22, 2014 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion for an
 Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Against Defendants Frank O.
 Comito and Linda A. Comito" also entered in the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit and remand this case for further proceedings
 consistent with this Opinion.
