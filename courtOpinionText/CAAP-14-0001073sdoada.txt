 HRCP Rule 13(f) provides:
 
Omitted Counterclaim. When a pleader fails to set up a
counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may by leave
of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.

the Mostoufis['] request to file a counterclaim."3 In support,
 
the Mostoufis argue that (1) res judicata does not bar them from
 
bringing forth their proposed counterclaim and (2) they are not
 estopped from bringing their proposed counterclaim because it is
 not compulsory.
 
After careful review of the record on appeal, the point
 
raised, the parties' arguments, and the applicable legal
 authority, we resolve the Mostoufis' arguments on appeal as
 follows and affirm:
 
In their briefs filed with this court, the Mostoufis
 
make no argument at all as to how the Circuit Court abused its
 discretion in denying their Motion. We presume, based on the
 arguments made in their briefs, that the Mostoufis' claim is the
 Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying them leave to file
 their counterclaim because res judicata did not bar their claims
 and because the proposed counterclaim was not compulsory. We
 address each argument in turn.
 
1. Res judicata limits "a litigant to one opportunity 
to litigate aspects of the case to prevent inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to promote finality and judicial economy." Eastern Savings Bank, FSB v. Eseteban, 129 Hawai
'i 
154, 158, 296 P.3d 1062, 1066 (2013). Hence, the purpose of the bar is to prevent a party from relitigating a claim that it already had a full and fair opportunity to litigate. See Kauhane 
v. Acutron Co., 71 Haw. 458, 463-64, 795 P.2d 276, 278-79 (1990). 
Here, the Mostoufis are not bringing an independent suit but
 moved for leave to file an omitted counterclaim for damages
 within the original suit.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of Hawaii (BOH) relies on 
Eastern Savings, 129 Hawai
'i at 160 n.10, 296 P.3d. at 1068 n.10, 
for the proposition that "[a] foreclosure judgment constitutes a 
3
 The Mostoufis' "Statement of Point of Error" section of their 
opening brief does not comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
Rule 28(b)(4) which is a basis for disregarding their point. O'Connor v. 
Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 385, 885 P.2d 361, 363 (1994). However,
as the appellate courts in this jurisdiction observe a policy of addressing
the merits of an appeal where possible, we will consider the Mostoufis' pointto the extent possible. O'Connor, 77 Hawai'i at 386, 885 P.2d at 364.
Counsel is warned that future violations of the rules may result in sanctions.

final judgment" and consequently, that the Mostoufis' attempt to
 
add their counterclaim was an effort to bring that claim in an
 separate suit. However, in Eastern Savings, the borrowers did
 not appeal the foreclosure judgment entered against them, thereby

 
allowing the judgment to become final. Eastern Savings, 129
 
Hawai'i at 155-56, 296 P.3d at 1063-64. Here, the Mostoufis' 
appeal of the February 25, 2013 Judgment entered on the decree of
 foreclosure and order of sale is still pending. Therefore, res
 judicata does not apply.
 
2. The widely accepted standard to determine whether
 
a claim is compulsory states:
 
A claim has a logical relationship to the original claim if
it arises out of the same aggregate of operative facts as
the original claim either because the same aggregate
operating facts serves as a basis of both claims or the core
of facts upon which the original claim rests activates
additional legal rights in party defendant that otherwise
would remain dormant.
 
Booth v. Lewis, 8 Haw. App. 249, 253, 798 P.2d 447, 449 (1990)
 
(citation omitted) (quoting 
Revere Copper & Brass, Inc. v. Aetna
 
Casualty & Sur. Co., 426 F.2d 709, 715 (5th Cir. 1970)). The
 
4
 purpose of HRCP Rule 13(a) is to resolve multiple issues in a
single suit and "is in the nature of an estoppel arising from the
 culpable conduct of a litigant in failing to assert a proper
 counterclaim." Bailey v. State, 57 Haw. 144, 148, 552 P.2d 365,
 
368 (1976) (quoting House v. Hanson, 72 N.W.2d 874, 877 (Minn.
 1955)).
 
4 HRCP Rule 13(a) provides:
 
Compulsory Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a
counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the
pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it
arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the
 subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not
require for its adjudication the presence of third parties
of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the
 pleader need not state the claim if (1) at the time the
action was commenced the claim was the subject of another
pending action or (2) the opposing party brought suit upon
the claim by attachment or other process by which the court
did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment
on that claim, and the pleader is not stating any
counterclaim under this Rule 13.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, the original claim in the complaint is based on
 
the facts underlying loan and mortgage transactions between the
 
Mostoufis and their lender BOH. The Mostoufis' counterclaim is
 based on BOH reporting that the Mostoufis had fallen behind in
 their payments, resulting in a negative impact on their credit. 
The specific claims the Mostoufis wish to make include breach of
 contract, misrepresentation, and omissions involving the
 modification of the same loans. Their counterclaim would not
 have arisen but for the loan and mortgage transactions with BOH. 
Therefore, a logical relationship exists between the Mostoufis'
 proposed counterclaim and the original claim, making the
 Mostoufis' counterclaim compulsory.
 
Notwithstanding the compulsory nature of the Mostoufis'
 
counterclaim, "Rule 13(f) empowers the court to authorize the

 
filing of such counterclaim by amendment[.]" See Am. Motorists
 
Ins. Co. v. City Wide Transp. Co., 308 F. Supp. 1080, 1083
 (S.D.N.Y. 1969).
5 A party may request leave to file an omitted 
compulsory counterclaim if they show "oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or [that] justice requires." Marks v. Marks, 
51 Haw. 548, 560, 465 P.2d 996, 1002 (1970) (quoting HRCP Rule 13(f)). The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has acknowledged that "when 
justice requires" is an independent and sufficient ground to grant leave for an omitted counterclaim. Marks, 51 Haw. at 563, 
465 P.2d at 1004. A trial court's denial of a Rule 13(f) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Ralston-Purina Co. v. 
Bertie, 541 F.2d 1363, 1367 (9th Cir. 1976). See Marks, 51 Haw. 
at 563-64, 465 P.2d at 1004 (In reviewing a trial court, "some discretion is vested in the trial court's hands, for both [HRCP] Rule 13(f) and 15(a) require leave of court."). 
5
 When adopted, HRCP Rule 13(f) contained the same basis for
amendment as Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 13(f).
 
Where we have patterned a rule of procedure after an
equivalent rule within the FRCP, interpretations of the rule
"by the federal courts are deemed to be highly persuasive in
the reasoning of this court." Harada v. Burns, 50 Haw. 528,
532, 445 P.2d 376, 380 (1968) (footnote omitted). 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai' i 214, 251-52, 948 P.2d
1055, 1092-93 (1997), FRCP Rule 13(f) was deleted in 2009 in favor of FRCPRule 15.

First, the Mostoufis did not argue below nor do they
 
argue on appeal "oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect"
 
for their omitted counterclaim. Therefore, this argument is
 deemed waived. HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
6
 
Second, in the Mostoufis' Motion, they argued justice
 
required that they be allowed to bring their counterclaim because
 (1) their "business was harmed as a direct result of [BOH]
 reporting their loans as delinquent to credit agencies," and
 (2) "[i]t is in the interest of both parties as well as judicial
 economy to resolve all of the claims in this action." However,
 the Mostoufis have not provided any legal authority or support
 for their position that justice requires that they be granted
 leave to file their omitted counterclaim under these
 circumstances. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
 
Further, notwithstanding that they were aware of the
 
facts underlying their counterclaim because they were included in
 their answer to the complaint, they filed their Motion almost
 three years after their answer was filed, one-and-a-half years
 after oral argument on both parties' summary judgment motions had
 been heard, and fifteen months after the Circuit Court had
 granted BOH's motion for summary judgment. The Mostoufis provide
 no explanation for the delay. See Ralston-Purina, 541 F.2d at
 
1367 (no abuse of discretion where the motion was brought six
 months after filing the answer, two months after a pretrial
 conference and no reasonable explanation for the delay in the
 record) and Sierra Club v. Pena, 915 F. Supp. 1381 (N.D. Ohio
 1996).
 
Finally, the Mostoufis argue that the statute of
 
limitations will prevent them from pursuing their counterclaim in
 a separate lawsuit. However, Rule 13(f) "does not give a party
 the privilege of totally neglecting its case and ignoring time
 limitations imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure even
 
6
 HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). "The argument, containing the contentions of
the appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with citations
to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on. The argument
may be preceded by a concise summary. Points not argued may be deemed
waived."

absent bad faith or dilatory motive on its part." Rohner, Gehrig
 
& Co. v. Capital City Bank, 655 F.2d 571, 576 (5th Cir. 1981). 
On this record, we conclude the Circuit Court did not
 
abuse its discretion when it denied the Mostoufis' Motion. 
Based on the foregoing, the July 24, 2014 "Order
 
Denying Defendants Hossain Mostoufi and Mitra Mostoufi's HRCP
 
Rule 13(f) Motion for Leave to File Omitted Counterclaim,"
 entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.
