PACE INVESTMENTS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,
a Delaware limited partnership, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ERNESTINE K. MARFIL, Defendant-Appellant, and
HEIRS AND/OR ASSIGNS OF NIKA (k); et al., Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 10-1-124K)

 
ORDER
 
(1)
 DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND

 
(2)
 DENYING ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN
APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAAP-14-0001076 AS MOOT

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant Ernestine
 
K. Marfil (Appellant Marfil) has asserted from the Honorable
 Ronald Ibarra's June 27, 2014 judgment, because the June 27, 2014
 does not specifically identify the claim or claims on which the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court intends to enter judgment, as required under the 
holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2013) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that 
"[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and 
HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.] 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
"For example: 'Pursuant to the jury verdict entered on (date), 
judgment in the amount of $___ is hereby entered in favor of Plaintiff X and against Defendant Y upon counts I through IV of the complaint.'" Id. at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(emphasis added). When interpreting the requirements for a 
judgment under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i noted 
that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
Although Plaintiff-Appellee Pace Investments Limited
 
Partnership (Appellee Pace Investments) complaint asserts
 
multiple claims through four separately enumerated counts, the
 June 27, 2014 judgment does not specifically identify the claim
 or claims on which the circuit court intends to enter judgment. 
For example, although the June 27, 2014 judgment declares that
 Appellee Pace Investments owns an interest in the subject
 property and certifies the judgment as to one or more but fewer
 than all claims or parties with an express finding of no just
 reason for delay pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), the June 27, 2014
 judgment does not explain whether the circuit court is entering
 this judgment pursuant to 
•	 Count 1 of Appellee Pace Investments' complaint
(which asserts a cause of action to quiet title),
or
 
•	 Count 2 of Appellee Pace Investments' complaint
(which asserts a cause of action for adverse
possession), or
 
• both Count 1 and Count 2 combined.
 
Therefore, June 27, 2014 judgment does not satisfy the
 
specificity requirements for an appealable final judgment in a
 case involving multiple claims under the holding in Jenkins.
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In its present form, the June 27, 2014 judgment does
 
not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment
 
under the holding in Jenkins. Absent an appealable final
 judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction and Appellant Marfil's
 appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001076 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDER that all pending motions in
 
appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001076 are denied as moot.
