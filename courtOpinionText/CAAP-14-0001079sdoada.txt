STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SAMUEL EAGER, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 13-1-0145)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Samuel Eager appeals from the 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence ("Judgment"), which the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court")1/ entered on 
June 30, 2014. Eager was convicted of Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 707­711(1)(b) (2014).
2/ Eager's conviction arose out of an incident 
in which Eager allegedly assaulted the complaining witness, then­79-year-old Hua Zhao Liang, on the sidewalk adjacent to the intersection of Kapiolani Boulevard and Cooke Street in Honolulu, Hawai
'i. 
Upon Eager's motion to order an HRS § 704-404
 
examination, the Circuit Court appointed a "3-member panel" of
 
1/ The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided. 
2/ The statute states, in relevant part: 
(1) 
A person commits the offense of assault in the
second degree if: 
. . . . 
(b) The person recklessly causes serious or
substantial bodily injury to another[.] 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 707-711(1)(b). 

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
physicians to assess Eager's fitness to proceed to trial and to
 
be held penally responsible for his conduct: Dr. Leonard S.
 Jacobs, Dr. Duke E. Wagner, and Dr. Olaf K. Gitter. Each of the
 doctors separately interviewed and assessed Eager before
 submitting their joint report to the Circuit Court, which
 subsequently issued a Judicial Determination of Fitness to
 Proceed and Order on June 13, 2013 finding that Eager was fit to
 proceed. Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court found Eager
 guilty and sentenced him to five years of incarceration and
 ordered restitution in the amount of $559.36 to the Department of
 Human Services and $267.60 to the Crime Victim's Compensation
 Commission. Eager timely appealed from the Judgment.
 
On appeal, Eager alleges that (1) he was deprived of a
 
fair trial because Dr. Wagner "considered the expert opinion of
 Dr. Jacobs in his testimony," which, Eager argues, improperly
 bolstered Dr. Jacobs' opinions, and (2) the trial court abused
 its discretion in sentencing Eager to five years imprisonment
 because there were strong mitigating factors to withhold a prison
 sentence and instead sentence Eager to probation. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Eager's points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
(1) In the Points on Appeal section of his opening
 
brief, Eager contends that he was deprived of a fair trial
 because Dr. Wagner considered in his testimony, and therefore
 bolstered, Dr. Jacobs' expert opinion. Eager's argument
 regarding this contention, however, consists of three statutory
 citations, two case citations, and one paragraph that essentially
 reiterates the point of error and adds his request that he be
 granted a new trial. 
At the outset, we note that Eager's argument makes no 
attempt to connect the facts of the case to the law he presents, which means that we may "disregard [the] particular contention [because he] makes no discernible argument in support of that position." Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i 126, 144 n.16, 276 
P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012) (quoting In re Guardianship of

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Carlsmith, 113 Hawai 'i 236, 246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) 
(internal quotation marks omitted)); see Haw. R. App. P. 
28(b)(7). Due to our policy of "affording the litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible[,]'" however, we nonetheless proceed on the merits insofar as we can discern them. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai
'i 
490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (quoting Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai
'i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 
989-90 (2004)). And in so doing, we conclude that Eager's first point is without merit. 
Dr. Wagner's trial testimony did not improperly bolster
 
the opinion of Dr. Jacobs. At trial, Eager objected when the
 State asked Dr. Wagner whether or not he reviewed Dr. Jacobs'
 report and findings:
 
[BY PROSECUTOR]:
 Q. Now, do you agree with his summary?
 
[PUBLIC DEFENDER]:  That's what I'm -­
THE COURT: 
Same objection, I sustained.
 
Counsel, the form of the question, Counsel, is whether

or not based on what Dr. Jacobs has written, in terms of his
opinion, whether or not that would change Dr. Wagner's
opinion as a result of what he read. 
[PUBLIC DEFENDER]: 
Yes, Your Honor.
 
THE COURT:  
Or does it have any effect on Dr. Wagner's
opinion, not whether or not he agrees or disagrees with Dr.
Jacobs, because at that point Dr. –- you're asking Dr.
Wagner to testify about the credibility of another witness.
 
[PROSECUTOR]: 
Mm-hm, okay.
 
THE COURT:  
So I'm going to sustain the objection, but
you can ask him whether or not, based on what Dr. Jacobs had
written, whether or not it would change Dr. Wagner's
opinion.
 
[PROSECUTOR]:  
Okay.
 
THE COURT:  
That's a fair question.
 
Dr. Wagner subsequently testified that Dr. Jacobs'
 
report did not change Dr. Wagner's opinion as to penal
 
responsibility, but gave him additional helpful information, from
 the perspective of a psychiatrist, regarding the effect of
 Eager's use of medications and substances. Eager contends that
 this constitues error because "[e]xpert testimony on a witness'
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
credibility is inappropriate." Pursuant to HRS § 704-404(4)(f)
 
(2014), however, "[a]fter all reports are submitted to the court,
 examiners may confer without restriction." In this case, Dr.
 Wagner testified about whether Dr. Jacobs' report changed Dr.
 Wagner's opinion; he did not provide any impermissible testimony
 on the subject of Dr. Jacobs' credibility. We conclude that Dr.
 Wagner did not improperly bolster Dr. Jacobs' credibility, and
 Eager was not deprived of a fair trial. 
(2) Eager's second argument on appeal is that the
 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in sentencing him to five
 years of imprisonment because, he claims, there were strong
 mitigating factors that should have caused the court to sentence
 him to probation rather than incarceration. We disagree.
 
Eager has failed to show that the Circuit Court abused
 
its discretion or that it did not consider the factors in HRS
 § 706-606. That statute states, in relevant part:
 
The court, in determining the particular sentence to be
imposed, shall consider:
 
(1)	 The nature and circumstances of the offense and
 
the history and characteristics of the defendant;
 
(2)	 The need for the sentence imposed:
 
(a)	 To reflect the seriousness of the offense,
to promote respect for law, and to provide
just punishment for the offense;
 
(b)	 To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct;
 
(c)	 To protect the public from further crimes
of the defendant; and
 
(d)	 To provide the defendant with needed
 educational or vocational training, medical
care, or other correctional treatment in
the most effective manner;
 
(3)	 The kinds of sentences available; and
 
(4)	 The need to avoid unwarranted sentence
 disparities among defendants with similar records
who have been found guilty of similar conduct.
 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 706-606 (2014). Although "[a] trial court is
 
'duty-bound to consider' the[se] factors . . . before imposing a
 sentence[,] 'the fact that a court does not orally address [each
 one] at the time of sentencing does not mean the court failed to
 consider th[em].'" State v. Thorp, No. CAAP-13-0000414, 2014 WL

4914623, *1 (Hawai 'i App. Sept. 30, 2014) (original brackets 
omitted) (citing  State v. Sinagoga, 81 Hawai 'i 421, 428, 918 P.2d 
228, 235 (App. 1996), overruled on other grounds by State v. 
Veikoso, 102 Hawai 'i 219, 74 P.3d 575 (2003)) (explaining further 
that "[t]he weight to be given the factors . . . is a matter generally left to the discretion of the sentencing court, taking into consideration the circumstances of each case" (quoting State v. Kong, 131 Hawai
'i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013) (internal 
quotation marks omitted))). In fact, "absent clear evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that a sentencing court will have considered all the factors." State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai
'i 495, 
518, 229 P.3d 313, 336 (2010) (brackets omitted) (applied in the context of concurrent/consecutive sentencing). 
In this case, the record demonstrates that the Circuit

 
Court carefully considered Eager's arguments in the context of
 the case. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the
 Circuit Court failed to consider the factors set forth in HRS
 § 706-606. In weighing these factors, the Circuit Court
 emphasized the nature and circumstances of Eager's offense, his
 prior criminal history, and the danger he posed to the community. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 in sentencing Eager to five years of imprisonment instead of
 probation. 
Therefore, the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 
filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on June 30, 2014
 is affirmed.
