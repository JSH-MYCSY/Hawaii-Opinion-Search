(CIVIL NO. 10-1-2445)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from a motor vehicle accident in
 
which Plaintiff-Appellant Richard A. Villaver alleges that he
 
sustained injuries from a collision that occurred in a parking
 lot on August 20, 2008, when a van owned by Defendant-Appellee
 Hawaii Mega-Cor, Inc. and driven by Defendant-Appellee David
 Sylva (collectively "Defendants") backed into the rear of an
 automobile that Villaver was driving.
 
Villaver appeals from the Order Granting Defendants 
David Kawika Sylva and Hawaii Mega-Cor., Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment Filed May 1, 2014, filed on June 26, 2014 ("Order Granting Summary Judgment") and the Judgment, filed on July 28, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1/ Villaver contends that the Circuit Court 
erred in granting summary judgment based upon facts deemed admitted under Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule

 without allowing the withdrawal of those admissions under
HRCP Rule 36(b).3/ Villaver concedes that "[t]his exact point
 
was not raised . . . below," but contends that his failure to
 
respond to discovery requests should be excused because he was
 proceeding pro se, has a faulty memory, and has difficulty with
 the English language, all of which was explained by his wife in a
 letter sent to defense counsel on April 11, 2014,
4/ and described
 
again at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Villaver's point of
 
2/
 HRCP Rule 36(a) states in pertinent part: 
The matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service
of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the
court may allow or as the parties agree to in writing . . .
the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the
party requesting the admission a written answer or objection
addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by the
party's attorney. 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 36(a) (2013).
 
3/
 HRCP Rule 36(b) states in pertinent part:
 
Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively
established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or
amendment of the admission. Subject to the provisions of
Rule 16 governing amendment of a pre-trial order, the court
may permit withrawal or amendment when the presentation of
the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the
party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court
that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in
maintaining his or her action or defense on the merits.
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 36(b) (2013).

 Mrs. Villaver's letter stated that Villaver had received
 
Defendants' discovery requests approximately one month earlier and understood
that the deadline for completion was April 18, 2014. Mrs. Villaver explained:
 
Unfortunately, my husband is unable to complete the
paperwork. When he tries to answer questions, he becomes
very stressed and overwhelmed. He also says that he has a
difficult time remembering all the specifics of his
treatment and the doctors that have treated him. Also, my
husband does not understand English well so that has made
completing this paperwork even more difficult.
 
He does not have legal representation at this time, so there
is no lawyer to help him. I cannot help him as I too have
been very negatively impacted by everything that has
happened in our lives since his accident and I too am
suffering from depression and anxiety.

error as follows and affirm.
 
Villaver filed his complaint on November 15, 2010. On 
February 7, 2012, trial was set for the week of May 13, 2013 and 
the matter proceeded to arbitration under the Court Annexed Arbitration Program. On August 23, 2012, the arbitrator issued her decision, awarding Villaver $24,245.58 in damages, including medical expenses of $5,942.62. On August 31, 2012, Villaver appealed and requested a trial de novo pursuant to Hawai
'i 
Arbitration Rules, Rule 22. 
On March 13, 2013, Villaver's attorney filed a motion
 
to continue trial and withdraw as counsel. Counsel's motion
 noted that Villaver had rejected counsel's recommendations on
 settlement and accused counsel of being "paid off" by others to
 not take his side or advocate for him. The motion further stated
 that Villaver would seek replacement legal counsel and no longer
 desired counsel's representation. The motion was granted at a
 hearing on April 3, 2013, and a trial setting status conference
 was scheduled for May 13, 2013. On May 13, 2013, Villaver
 appeared pro se and requested additional time to obtain an
 attorney. The trial setting status conference was continued
 until June 20, 2013. On June 20, 2013, Villaver again appeared
 pro se, and trial was set for the week of June 23, 2014. On
 March 17, 2014, Defendants served discovery, including requests
 for admission, upon Villaver.
 
Villaver petitions this court to treat Mrs. Villaver's
 
April 11, 2014 letter to defense counsel and his request for an
 interpreter at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment,
 collectively, as a sufficient substitute for a motion to withdraw
 the admissions under HRCP Rule 36(b). Villaver contends that,
 since allowing withdrawal would have subserved the presentation
 of the merits and Defendants are unable to show that withdrawal
 of the admissions would cause them any prejudice, summary
 judgment was inappropriate. 
Although we adhere to the policy of affording litigants 
the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible, Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai
'i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 
94 (2012) (citing Morgan v. Planning Dept., 104 Hawai 'i 173, 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
180–81, 86 P.3d 982, 989–90 (2004)), pro se plaintiffs are not
 
exempt from discovery rules. Mrs. Villaver could not represent
 Villaver, Villaver did not sign his wife's letter, and the letter 
is not an objection to the request in accordance with the rules. 
Similarly, Villaver's in-court request for appointment of an
 interpreter is not a request to withdraw the admissions.
 
"The purpose of Rule 36(a) is to expedite trial by
 
establishing certain material facts as true and thus narrowing
 the range of issues for trial." Asea, Inc. v. S. Pacific Transp.
 
Co., 669 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir. 1981); see Conlon v. United
 States, 474 F.3d 616, 622 (9th Cir. 2007) ("[T]he rule seeks to
 serve two important goals: truth-seeking in litigation and
 efficiency in dispensing justice."). While in most cases the
 court should first order an amended answer, and deem the matter
 admitted only if a sufficient answer is not timely filed, this
 determination is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.
 Asea, 669 F.2d at 1247. 
Hawai
'i courts have determined that HRCP Rule 36(b) is 
identical to the federal rules, and therefore, have been guided by federal case law in the interpretation and application of the rule. W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., 
8 Haw. App. 354, 366, 802 P.2d 1203, 1209 (1990). "Rule 36(b) is permissive, not mandatory, with respect to the withdrawal of admissions." Conlon, 474 F.3d at 621. Therefore, "in exercising 
its discretion the court must apply the test set forth in Rule 36(b): (1) whether 'the presentation of the merits will be subserved' if the withdrawal of the admission is permitted and (2) whether the party who obtained the admission can 'satisfy the
 court that withdrawal . . . will prejudice him in maintaining his
 action or defense on the merits.'" W.H. Shipman, 8 Haw. App. at
 
366-67, 802 P.2d at 1209-10. 
Here, trial had already been continued once from May
 
2013 to June 2014. 
Furthermore, Villaver attended the June 20,
 
2013 trial setting status conference and was fully aware of the
 discovery and trial deadlines set there. Defendants gave proper
 notice that Villaver had thirty days to provide responses under
 HRCP Rule 36. Villaver ignored these obligations and instead his
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
wife, approaching the thirty day mark, sent a letter to defense
 
counsel stating that Villaver was unable to answer the questions. 
At the May 21, 2014 hearing on the Defendants' motion
 
for summary judgment, Villaver did not argue that his admissions
 should be withdrawn, but instead asked that he be appointed an
 interpreter. Furthermore, Villaver acknowledged that he did not
 file any opposition to the motion. As to Villaver's request for
 an interpreter, the Circuit Court asked Villaver about his
 background and education, and Villaver stated that he had lived
 in Hawaii since he was ten years old and had attended public
 school in Hawaii. The Circuit Court noted, and Villaver
 acknowledged, that he had been in court previously and had not
 indicated a need for an interpreter. Moreover, Defendants argued
 that they would be prejudiced if the case was delayed further,
 that the discovery cut-off had passed on April 24, 2014, that the
 deadline for final naming of witnesses had passed, that the
 deadline to respond to discovery was April 18, 2014, and the
 deadline for dispositive motions was May 5, 2014. Therefore, the
 Circuit Court concluded that there was no indication that
 Villaver needed an interpreter, that the responses would be
 deemed admitted, and that summary judgment was warranted.
 
Villaver argues that because this court has interpreted
 
past due answers to requests for admission as a motion to
 withdraw deemed admissions, his oral explanation at the summary
 judgment hearing should be treated the same. See id. at 366, 802
 
P.2d at 1209 (holding that while a formal motion was not filed,
 past due answers to requests for admission should be considered
 an informal motion for withdrawal). W.H. Shipman, however, is
 
distinguishable from the instant case because this court held: 
(1) Hawaiian Holiday produced the documents requested by
Shipman; (2) Shipman took the deposition of two officers of
Hawaiian Holiday; (3) Hawaiian Holiday, albeit belatedly,
answered Shipman's interrogatories; and (4) when Hawaiian
Holiday filed its motion to Amend on November 25, 1988, it was
two and a half months before the scheduled trial. Based on
 these facts, Shipman was not prejudiced.
 
Id. at 367, 802 P.2d at 1210; see In re Trade Wind Tours of
 
Hawaii, Inc., 6 Haw. App. 260, 265-66, 718 P.2d 1122, 1127 (1986)
 (finding taxpayer was not prejudiced because taxpayer took a
 deposition and presented its case as if the Director had not
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
admitted the matters in the request for admissions). 
Furthermore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its
 
discretion in concluding that the Defendants would have been
 
prejudiced in maintaining their defense if withdrawal was
 permitted. Villaver never attempted to answer any of the
 requests for admission, he did not move forward with discovery in
 any way, and the discovery cut-off, witness naming, and
 dispositive motions deadlines had passed. Unlike the situation
 in W.H. Shipman where there were two and one-half months until
 trial, there were only a few weeks until trial in this case. See
 
Conlon, 474 F.3d at 619-24 (holding that the "district court did
 not clearly err in finding that withdrawal of the deemed
 admissions at such a late stage in the case would prejudice the
 United States."). 
As this case is distinguishable from W.H. Shipman, Mrs.
 
Villaver's letter states no objection to the Defendants' requests
 for admissions, Villaver's request for appointment of an
 interpreter does not constitute a request for withdrawal of
 admissions, the Defendants established that withdrawal of
 Villaver's admissions would have prejudiced them in defending the
 action on the merits, and we find no other reason to excuse
 Villaver's failure to meet his discovery obligations, we conclude
 that the Circuit Court did not err in its Order Granting Summary
 Judgment based on the facts deemed admitted. Therefore, we
 affirm the June 26, 2014 Order Granting Summary Judgment and the
 July 28, 2014 Judgment, filed in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit.
