MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
I. 
Introduction 
Applicant for Intervention/Appellant Jacques 
Bartholomew Garrett (Garrett) and Defendants/Appellants Rafael 
Lopez and Josephine Lopez (collectively, the Lopezes) appeal from 
the "Judgment for Possession" (Judgment) and "Writ of 
Possession," both entered on August 22, 2014, in favor of 
Plaintiff/Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Terrazza/Cortebella/Las Brisas/Tiburon (AOAO), in the District 
Court of the First Circuit, # Ewa Division (district court).1 
On appeal, Garrett and the Lopezes contend that the 
district court erred by denying both (1) Garrett's "Motion to 
Intervene," and (2) Garrett and the Lopezes' "Joint Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction" (joint motion to
dismiss).  This case raises issues as to whether: the issuance of 
a certificate of title number on a Quitclaim Deed recorded in 
Land Court by the AOAO precluded Garrett from challenging title to the subject property (Property); and if not, whether Garrett 
sufficiently established that title to the Property is in 
question. 
For the reasons discussed below, we hold that Garrett 
was not precluded from challenging title to the Property and sufficiently established that title to the Property is in question. Thus, the district court lacked jurisdiction.
II. Background
A. Facts 
The Property is a unit located at 91-248 Makalauna 
Place, # Ewa Beach, Hawai# i 96706 in the condominium project known 
as Cortabella Phase 6. On or about February 9, 2009, Garrett 
purchased the Property via an Apartment Deed, subject to, among other things, the "By-laws of the Association of Apartment Owners of Cortabella, Phase 6" (Bylaws). 
On October 12, 2009, the AOAO filed a "Notice of Lien 
for Unpaid Assessments" at the Office of the Assistant Registrar, Land Court, State of 
Hawai# i (Land Court).  
On March 14, 2011, the AOAO purported to foreclose its 
lien on the Property via a power of sale foreclosure procedure pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 514B-146 and 667-5 
through 667-10, and recorded its "Notice of Association's Non-
Judicial Foreclosure Under Power of Sale" with the State of Hawai
#i Bureau of Conveyances. 
1 The Honorable Paul B.K. Wong entered the Judgment and Writ of
Possession. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On May 3, 2011, the AOAO, by and through its attorneys, 
conducted a public auction sale and, there being no other bidders 
present, declared the Property sold to the AOAO. 
On May 18, 2011, the AOAO recorded its "Affidavit of 
Non-Judicial Foreclosure Sale Under Power of Sale" (Affidavit) at 
the Land Court as document no. 4,073,851. 
On May 23, 2011, the AOAO filed a Quitclaim Deed at the 
Land Court, conveying the Property to the AOAO. The Land Court 
issued certificate of title no. 1,024,156 on the Quitclaim Deed. 
On June 22, 2011, the AOAO entered into a rental 
agreement with the Lopezes and Chantel Aduna. The agreement was to run from July 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. The AOAO asserts the Lopezes repeatedly failed to pay the monthly rent as provided in the agreement.
B. Procedural History 
On June 17, 2014, counsel for the AOAO wrote a letter 
to the Lopezes regarding their alleged default under the terms of 
the rental agreement and demanding payment in the amount of $40,515 within five business days.
2 The letter also notified the 
Lopezes that any failure to comply with the demand for payment would result in the AOAO pursuing their eviction. 
On June 25, 2014, the AOAO filed a Complaint of Summary 
Possession to gain possession of the Property, alleging that the Lopezes had failed to pay the amount demanded. 
On July 28, 2014, Garrett filed a motion to intervene 
and, together with the Lopezes, a joint motion to dismiss asserting that the district court lacked jurisdiction regarding the AOAO's Complaint. Attached to the motions was a Hawai# i 
District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (HDCRCP) Rule 12.1

2 $40,515 is the sum of $37,000 in overdue rent through June 2014, plus
$3,515 in late charges.

3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Declaration by Garrett, asserting that he had superior title to 
the Property because, inter alia, the AOAO did not have authority to conduct the non-judicial foreclosure. 
On August 14, 2014, the district court held a hearing 
on the motions and orally denied them. 
On August 22, 2014, the district court entered its 
Judgment and Writ of Possession in favor of the AOAO, effective "[f]orthwith." 
On August 29, 2014, the Lopezes filed a timely Notice 
of Appeal. The Lopezes then filed an Amended Notice of Appeal, adding Garrett as an Applicant for Intervention, on September 3, 2014. The Lopezes and Garrett filed a Second Amended Notice of Appeal on September 5, 2014. In the Second Amended Notice of Appeal, the Lopezes and Garrett stated: 
[f]ollowing a hearing on August 14, 2014, "(1) Jacques
Bartholomew Garrett's Motion to Intervene, and (2) Jacquest
[sic] Bartholomew Garrett and Defendants Rafael Lopez andJosephine Lopez's [sic] Joint Motion to Dismiss for Lack ofSubject Matter Jurisdiction" filed July 28, 2014, waserroneously denied by the Court. [The AOAO's] counselfailed to prepare an order denying that motion pursuant toRule 23 of the Hawaii Rules of the District Courts, and
caused the aforementioned judgment for possession and writ
of possession to be prematurely entered anyway.Nevertheless, the Lopezes and Bartholomew hereby appeal fromthe District Court's decision denying that motion. A copyof the District Court's minutes for the August 14, 2014hearing are attached[.] 
On February 19, 2015, the district court entered its 
written "Order Denying (1) [Garrett's] Motion to Intervene, and 
(...continued)

or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to thejurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,or one in which the title to real estate is involved, suchdefense shall be asserted by a written answer or writtenmotion, which shall not be received by the court unlessaccompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forththe source, nature and extent of the title claimed bydefendant to the land in question, and such furtherparticulars as shall fully apprise the court of the natureof defendant's claim.

(2) [Garrett] and [the Lopezes'] Joint Motion to Dismiss for Lack
of Subject Matter Jurisdiction."4
III. Standard of Review
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that
we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Lingle v.
Hawai#i Gov't Emps. Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, 107 Hawai# i 178,
182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005).
B. Motion to Intervene
"An order denying an application for intervention by
right under Rule 24(a)(2), [Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP)], . . . is reviewable under the right/wrong standard of
review."  Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai#i 341, 343, 910 P.2d 112, 114
(1996) (citing Kim v. H.V. Corp., 5 Haw. App. 298, 301, 668 P.2d
1158, 1160 (1984)).5
IV. Discussion
A. Certificate of Title
In Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai# i 95, 101,
110 P.3d 1042, 1048 (2005), the Hawai# i Supreme Court held with
regard to Land Court property that challenges to foreclosures
4  The Honorable Michael K. Tanigawa presided at the August 14, 2014
hearing and entered the February 19, 2015 order. 
5  HRCP Rule 24(a)(2) provides that:
Rule 24.  Intervention.
(a)  Intervention of Right.  Upon timely application
anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: . . .
(2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the
property or transaction which is the subject of the action
and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the
action may as a practical matter impair or impede the
applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the
applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing
parties.  
The text of HDCRCP Rule 24(a) and HRCP Rule 24(a) are materially similar. 
Thus, we apply the same standards as those applicable to HRCP Rule 24(a)(2). 
See, e.g., Hosaka v. Hosaka, No. 30416, 2012 WL 5831181, *1 (Hawai #i App. Nov.
16, 2012) (SDO) ("In all respects relevant to this appeal, [Hawaii Family
Court Rules] Rule 24(a)(2) is identical to Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure
(HRCP) Rule 24(a)(2).  Thus, we apply the same standards as those applicable
to HRCP Rule 24(a)(2).").
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
based on a mortgagee's power of sale must be raised prior to the
entry of a new certificate of title.  The supreme court's holding
relied on, inter alia , HRS § 501-118 (2006) which provides:
§501-118.  Foreclosure.
. . . .
In case of foreclosure by exercising the power of sale
without a previous judgment, the affidavit required by
chapter 667 shall be recorded with the assistant registrar.
The purchaser or the purchaser's assigns at the foreclosure
sale may thereupon at any time present the deed under the
power of sale to the assistant registrar for recording and
obtain a new certificate.  Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in
interest from directly impeaching by action or otherwise,
any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land, prior
to the entry of a new certificate of title.
After a new certificate of title has been entered, no
judgment recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due
thereon shall operate to open the foreclosure or affect the
title to registered land.
(Emphasis added).
Garrett and the Lopezes argue that because the AOAO
obtained only a transfer certificate of title number from the
Land Court pursuant to their Affidavit and Quitclaim Deed, and
not an actual Certificate of Title, no law prevents Garrett from
contesting title pursuant to the underlying unauthorized non-
judicial foreclosure.  The AOAO disagrees, and argues that under
Aames, its title to the Property became conclusive and
unimpeachable upon issuance of the transfer certificate of title
number alone.
Recently, the supreme court held in Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. v. Omiya, 142 Hawai#i 439, 420 P.3d 370 (2018) that
assignment of a new transfer certificate of title number by the
Land Court does not demonstrate that a new certificate of title
has been duly prepared and entered, as required to invoke the
statutory protection provided by HRS § 501-118.  Id. at 455, 420
P.3d at 386.  
In that case, Omiya, who had purchased property at a
non-judicial foreclosure sale, presented a quitclaim deed to the
Assistant Registrar of the Land Court, who stamped it with the
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
date and time.  Id.  That stamp registered the quitclaim deed,
making it effective as a conveyance.  Id. (citing HRS §§ 501-101,
501-107 (Supp. 2016)) (footnote omitted).  However, the supreme
court noted that "HRS § 501-118 specifies 'entry of a new
certificate of title' as the determinative point when foreclosure
proceedings may no longer be impeached[,]" and held that the
plain meaning of "entry of a new certificate of title" "clearly
contemplates the transcription of information into some common
repository, and not merely the acceptance or stamping of an
existing document."  Id. at 449-50, 420 P.3d at 380-81 (citing
Entry, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) ("An item written
in a record; a notation.")) (Emphasis in original).  The supreme
court's analysis of the legislative history of HRS § 501-118 and
other statutes, in pari materia , supported the same conclusion. 
Id. at 449-53, 420 P.3d at 380-84.
The supreme court thus concluded that registering a
quitclaim deed and receipt of a stamped number "is not equivalent
to the creation or entry of a new certificate of title. . . .
[T]he evidence does not show that a new certificate of title was
entered; had one been created, a certified and sealed copy of the
certificate would have been admissible as evidence."  Id. at 455,
420 P.3d at 386 (citing HRS § 501-88 (2006) (certified and sealed
copies of certificates "shall be received as evidence in all the
courts of the State")).  The supreme court specifically noted
that:
the stamp on the quitclaim deed in this case reads "Issuance
of Cert(s) 996,234." . . .  But, as explained, assignment of
a new TCT number does not demonstrate that a new certificate
of title has been duly prepared and entered.  Thus, the
record in this case does not show that "a new certificate of
title has been entered," which is required to invoke the
statutory protection provided by HRS § 501-118.
Id. (footnote omitted).  As a result, the supreme court held that
summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of Omiya because
he relied on the transfer certificate of title number to
demonstrate that a new certificate had been issued.  Id. at 456,
420 P.3d at 387.  
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In the instant case, the stamp on the AOAO's Quitclaim
Deed reads "Issuance of Cert(s) 1,024,156."  No certified and
sealed copy of a Certificate of Title is present in the record on
appeal, nor does the AOAO argue that one exists.  Based on Omiya,
Garrett's assertion of interest in the Property is not barred by
HRS § 501-118.
B. Joint Motion to Dismiss
Garrett and the Lopezes argue that because Garrett's
declaration attached to his motion to intervene and the joint
motion to dismiss was sufficient under HDCRCP Rule 12.1, the
district court lacked jurisdiction over the proceeding pursuant
to HRS § 604-5(d) (2016).6
HDCRCP Rule 12.1 was adopted to prevent abuse of HRS
§ 604–5(d) by requiring a defendant challenging the district
court's jurisdiction to file an affidavit describing the
defendant's claim to title with specificity.  Ass'n of Apartment
Owners of Century Center, Inc. v. Nomura, No. CAAP-15-0000119,
2016 WL 2940855, *3 ( Hawai#i App. May 11, 2016) (Mem. Op.)
(citing Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai# i 32,
36, 265 P.3d 1128, 1132 (2011)).   The Hawai #i Supreme Court has
explained:7
6  HRS § 604-5(d) provides:
§604-5  Civil jurisdiction.
. . . .
(d) The district courts shall not have cognizance of
real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate
comes in question, nor actions for libel, slander,
defamation of character, malicious prosecution, false
imprisonment, breach of promise of marriage, or seduction;
nor shall they have power to appoint referees in any cause.
(Emphasis added).
7  Although HDCRCP Rule 12.1 specifically calls for an "affidavit" of
the defendant, Hawai #i appellate courts have also deemed declarations
acceptable.  See Aames, 107 Hawai #i at 99, 110 P.3d at 1046 (holding that
appellees' "declaration and subsequent motion to dismiss together may be
construed as fulfilling the HDCRCP Rule 12.1 requirement that a defense to
title be asserted in a 'written motion' or 'written answer[.]'"); Nomura, 2016
WL 2940855, at *3-6. 
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[T]he source, nature, and extent of title claimed by the
defendant, must be described to the court with some detail
and specificity.  In addition to particularly describing the
source, nature, and extent of title, the defendant may also
include in the affidavit any other particulars, the
objective being to apprise the court fully of the nature of
the defendant's claim.  This, in turn, would obviate the
risk of dishonest and reckless pleas[.]
Peelua, 126 Hawai# i at 37, 265 P.3d at 1133.
Nomura provides helpful guidance.  In Nomura, an AOAO
had acquired its interest in the subject unit through a
non-judicial foreclosure of a lien for payments owed to the AOAO,
and the AOAO thereafter filed a summary possession complaint in
district court.  2016 WL 2940855, at *1-2.  The Nomura defendants
filed a motion to dismiss, supported by their joint declaration,
asserting that they had purchased the unit and obtained title
through a quitclaim deed, which they attached as an exhibit; that
the non-judicial foreclosure under power of sale by which the
AOAO had acquired its interest was invalid because the AOAO's
governing documents did not authorize it to conduct a
non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale; and therefore, the
district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the
case was "an action in which the title to real property is in
dispute."  Id. at *2–4.  We held in Nomura that the defendants
"have sufficiently set forth the scope, nature, and extent of
their claim to title to the land in question[,]" and
"[t]herefore, the district court was without jurisdiction under
HRS § 604–5(d) because title to the land in question was at
issue."  Id. at *5.
In the instant case, Garrett submitted an HDCRCP Rule
12.1 declaration in support of his motion to intervene and the
joint motion to dismiss, attesting that:  (1) Garrett is the
rightful and superior title holder of the subject Property and is
a member of the AOAO; (2) Garrett purchased the Property in
February 2009 from Frederick Ordonez Esperenza, Marie Grace
Gagarin Ganiron Esperenza, and Flordeliza Gagarin Ganiron; (3)
the attached Exhibit 1 - Garrett's Apartment Deed to the
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Property, recorded as Document No. 3828726 on February 13, 2009,
represents "the source of my claim to superior [title] herein";
(4) the AOAO Bylaws did not contain a power of sale by
non-judicial foreclosure, and thus the sale to itself was void
because it was not conducted in compliance with its own Bylaws or
HRS § 667, Chapter 514A, or Chapter 514B; (5) Garrett, as owner
and superior title holder to the Property, is entitled to all
rent and money that the AOAO wrongly collected from the Lopezes;
(6) the AOAO previously filed an action for ejectment in the
district court, for which the district court held that it lacked
subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d) and
dismissed the case; (7) by filing the instant action, the AOAO
seeks to assert ownership over the Property and collect rents
under the rental agreement with the Lopezes; (8) if Garrett is
not allowed to intervene, his ability to protect his ownership
interests in the Property will be severely impeded; (9) no other
named parties in the instant case will adequately protect
Garrett's ownership interest in the Property; and (10) Garrett
filed the motion to intervene and joined the motion to dismiss
seeking to assert ownership interest in the Property. 
Garrett, like the appellants in Nomura, has
sufficiently set forth the scope, nature, and extent of his claim
to the Property.  See also Fed. Nat. Mortg. Ass'n v. Brown, No.
CAAP–11–0000572, 2014 WL 2095045, at *5 (Hawai #i. App. May 19,
2014).  Garrett's claim to title arises from the Apartment Deed
recorded on February 13, 2009 conveying title to the Property to
Garrett. 
Garrett has also set forth with particularity the basis
of his challenge to the AOAO's claim to superior title,
sufficient to apprise the district court as to how his allegation
bears on the question of title.  See Peelua, 126 Hawai #i at 38-
39, 265 P.3d at 1134-35.  Specifically, Garrett's declaration
raised the contention that the AOAO's non-judicial foreclosure
and any subsequent attempt to transfer title to the Property are
void and unenforceable, because the AOAO did not have the right
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure over the Property.  As this
court recently held in Sakal v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of
Hawaiian Monarch, 143 Hawai# i 219, 426 P.3d 443 (App. 2018), a
power of sale in favor of a foreclosing association must exist in
the association's bylaws or another enforceable agreement with
its unit owners in order for the association to avail itself of
the non-judicial power of sale foreclosure procedures set forth
in HRS chapter 667.  Id. at 220-21, 426 P.3d at 444-45.  We also
held that neither HRS §§ 514A-90 nor 514B-146 authorize an
association to conduct a non-judicial or power of sale
foreclosure other than as provided in HRS chapter 667, which in
turn does not authorize a non-judicial power of sale foreclosure 
absent an otherwise existing power of sale.  Id. at 452, 426 P.3d
at 228.
In the instant case, the AOAO's Affidavit of Non-
Judicial Foreclosure Under Power of Sale and the Quitclaim Deed,
transferring the Property from the AOAO to the AOAO, cite HRS 
§§ 667-5 through 667-10, Chapters 514A and 514B, HRS § 514B-146,
"the Declaration of Condominium Property Regime for 'Cortebella,
Phase 6' Condominium Project," and the Bylaws as the sources of
the AOAO's authority to conduct the nonjudicial power of sale
foreclosure on the Property.  In light of our holding in Sakal
and the record in this case, it appears that the facts elucidated
in Garrett's declaration are not speculative, but clearly state
the grounds upon which Garrett challenges the AOAO's claim to
title.  Cf. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Castro, 131 Hawai #i 28, 38,
313 P.3d 717, 727 (2013) (holding that assertions in a8
8  We note that although Garrett was not a named party in the underlying
district court case, the district court could properly consider the contents
of his declaration in assessing his motion to intervene and the joint motion
to dismiss.  See Ass'n of Apartment v. Thai Hawaiian Massage, Inc., Nos.
CAAP–14–0000436 and CAAP–14–0001238, 2016 WL 3524592 (Hawai #i App. Jun. 24,
2016) (SDO) (holding that a non-party to a summary possession district court
case sufficiently set forth the scope, nature, and extent of its claim to
title in the disputed property via a declaration attached to its motion to
intervene and joint motion to dismiss filed with defendants-occupants of the
property, thereby raising a question as to title such that the district court
lacked jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5(d)). 
11NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
declaration challenging the validity of a non-judicial
foreclosure did not establish how the assertions affected the
defendant's claim to title).
The AOAO's Answering Brief additionally cites HRS
§ 667-102 (2016), effective June 28, 2012, to argue that the AOAO
alone has an interest in the Property.  HRS § 667-102 provides,
in relevant part:
[§ 667-102]  Recordation of affidavit, conveyance
document; effect.  (a) The affidavit required under section
667-101 and the conveyance document shall be recorded no
earlier than ten days after the public sale is held but not
later than forty-five days after the public sale is held.
The affidavit and the conveyance document may be recorded
separately and on different days. After the recordation, the
association shall mail or deliver a recorded copy to those
persons entitled to receive the public notice of the public
sale under section 667-96(c).
(b)   When both the affidavit and the conveyance
document are recorded:
(1)The sale of the unit is considered completed;
(2)All persons claiming by, through, or under the
unit owner and all other persons having liens on
the unit junior to the lien of the association
shall be forever barred of and from any and all
right, title, interest, and claims at law or in
equity in and to the unit and every part of the
unit, except as otherwise provided by law;
(3)The lien of the association and all liens junior
in priority to the lien of an association shall
be automatically extinguished from the unit; and
(4)The purchaser shall be entitled to immediate and
exclusive possession of the unit.
(c)   The unit owner and any person claiming by,
through, or under the unit owner and who is remaining in
possession of the unit after the recordation of the
affidavit and the conveyance document shall be considered a
tenant at sufferance subject to eviction or ejectment.  The
purchaser may bring an action in the nature of summary
possession under chapter 666, ejectment, or trespass or may
bring any other appropriate action in a court where the unit
is located to obtain a writ of possession, a writ of
assistance, or any other relief. In any such action, the
court shall award the prevailing party its reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs and all other reasonable fees and
costs, all of which are to be paid for by the non-prevailing
party.
(Emphasis added).  The enactment of HRS § 667-102, which became
effective after the relevant events in the instant case, may
potentially raise an additional issue regarding title to the
Property.
12NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Based on the foregoing, we hold that the district court
was without jurisdiction under HRS § 604-5(d) because title to
the Property is at issue.  
C. Motion to Intervene
In light of our holding regarding the district court's
lack of jurisdiction, it would appear that the issue of whether
Garrett's motion to intervene was properly denied or not is now
moot.  Cf.  McCabe Hamilton & Renny Co., Ltd. v. Chung, 98 Hawai# i
107, 117, 43 P.3d 244, 254 (App. 2002) ("Were we to conclude on
the merits that the Union should have been granted leave to
intervene, we would be in the surreal position of granting the
Union leave to intervene in proceedings that no longer exist")
(citing U.S. v. Ford, 650 F.2d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir. 1981)).
V. Conclusion
The "Judgment for Possession" and "Writ of Possession,"
both entered on August 22, 2014, in the District Court of the
First Circuit, # Ewa Division, are vacated.  This case is remanded
to the district court with instructions to dismiss the summary
possession action for lack of jurisdiction.
