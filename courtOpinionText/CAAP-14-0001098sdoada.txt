RODILLO M. TABUYO, SR. and MERLINA D. TABUYO,
Plaintiff-Appellants,
v.
 
ROBERT C. REISH and SUSAN N. REISH, INDIVIDUALLY AND
AS TRUSTEES FOR THE REISH 1995 FAMILY TRUST AS CREATED
 
BY DECLARATION OF TRUST DATED SEPTEMBER 18, 1995,
Defendants-Appellants, and DOES 1-30, Defendants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2029)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth, J.,
with Ginoza, J., concurring separately)
 
This appeal arises out of the non-judicial foreclosure

 
sale of a piece of real property ("Property"), which Defendants-
Appellees Robert C. Reish and Susan N. Reish, individually and as
 Trustees for The Reish 1995 Family Trust as created by
 Declaration of Trust dated September 18, 1995 (collectively, the
 "Reishs") conducted on May 6, 2009. This foreclosure came about
 after Plaintiffs-Appellants Rodillo M. Tabuyo, Sr. and Merlina D.
 Tabuyo (collectively, the "Tabuyos") allegedly defaulted on a
 $150,000 loan from the Reishs, which the parties secured with a
 second mortgage on the Property in late 2007 (the "Loan").

Judgment on the Second Amended Complaint Filed on February 10,
 2014 and Order to Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action" ("Second

all of which were filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
3/ 4/
("Circuit Court")  on August 5, 2014.
On appeal, the Tabuyos allege that the Circuit Court
 
"abused its discretion and incorrectly granted" the MTD/MSJ on

 
the Second Amended Complaint because: (1) the Tabuyos' contention
 that the Reishs' non-judicial foreclosure was procured via
 mortgage fraud ("Count I") "was stated with sufficient
 particularity" under Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") 
Rule 9(b); (2) the Tabuyos' contention that the Reishs'
 fraudulently-obtained title could not be assigned ("Count II")
 "was stated with sufficient particularity"; and (3) the Tabuyos'
 contention that the Reishs' mortgage fraud is a sufficient basis
 
2/
 On July 12, 2013, the Reishs filed "Defendants' Motion to Dismiss
or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment on the First Amended
Complaint filed September 24, 2009". On January 13, 2014, the Circuit Court
entered an order granting the motion. Specifically, the Circuit Court granted
the motion without prejudice as to the first, second, and seventh counts of
the Tabuyos' first amended complaint, and granted with prejudice as to the
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth counts. Prior to issuing the order, the
Circuit Court issued a Minute Order on November 26, 2013, explaining that
"[t]he court grants the motion as to counts one and two as these counts were
not plead with sufficient specificity and particularity as required by HRCP
Rule 9(b). The court grants the motion as to count seven as [the Tabuyos]
have failed to submit evidence that [the Reishs] misrepresented the terms of
the loan to [the Tabuyos]." On February 10, 2014, the Tabuyos filed
"Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint for Wrongful Foreclosure; for
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Restoring Possession and Title; and for
Actual, Treble and Punitive Damages" ("Second Amended Complaint"), in which
they re-asserted the three counts that were dismissed without prejudice on
January 13, 2014, using nearly identical language as the first amended
complaint.

 The Circuit Court did not specify whether it construed the
February 18, 2014 "Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative,Motion for Summary Judgment on the Second Amended Complaint Filed onFebruary 10, 2014" ("MTD/MSJ on the Second Amended Complaint") as a motion todismiss for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted" underHRCP Rule 12(b)(6) or a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56. However,the Reishs appended several declarations and other exhibits, which the CircuitCourt did not exclude, to their motion. Thus, we treat the MTD/MSJ on theSecond Amended Complaint "as seeking summary judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 56and apply the standard of review relating to motions for summary judgment."

upon which to claim punitive damages ("Count III") was not
 
baseless. Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 the Tabuyos' points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
(1) The Tabuyos' first argument on appeal is that Count
 
I of the Second Amended Complaint—that the Reishs' non-judicial
 foreclosure was procured via mortgage fraud—was stated with
 sufficient particularity under HRCP Rule 9(b). In support of
 their contention, the Tabuyos essentially argue that the Circuit
 Court erred because it (a) applied the wrong legal standard to
 evaluate the Tabuyos' pleadings, which the court allegedly
 derived from the dicta of an unpublished, factually
 distinguishable, federal case: Enriquez v. J.P. Morgan Chase
 Bank, N.A., No. 2:08-cv-01422-RCJ-LRL, 2009 WL 160245 (D. Nev.
 Jan. 22, 2009); (b) misapplied HRCP Rule 9(b), which, the Tabuyos
 claim, is satisfied by Counts I and II of the Second Amended
 Complaint; and (c) "did not properly apply the [motion for
 summary judgment] standards to the facts of this case." We
 disagree. 
(1)(a) The Tabuyos have failed to demonstrate that the
 
Circuit Court did, in fact, apply the Enriquez standard to
 evaluate the Second Amended Complaint,
5/ or that the standard it
 
did apply was incorrect.
 
Because the Circuit Court did not state the rationale
 
behind its decision to grant the MTD/MSJ on the Second Amended
 Complaint in the Second MTD/MSJ Order, the Judgment, or the
 Notice of Entry of Judgment, the Tabuyos "presume[] . . . that
 
the [Circuit Court] adopted the REISHS' position on each issue
 
where it dismissed a count in the TABUYOS' [Second Amended
 C]omplaint." A review of the record on appeal, however, suggests
 otherwise.
 
Counts I and II of the Second Amended Complaint are
 
nearly identical to the first two counts of the Tabuyos'
 
5/
 Although the Reishs' MTD/MSJ on the Second Amended Complaint
provides a single citation to Enriquez, 2009 WL 160245, the motion advances no
argument with respect to the Enriquez rule. 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
September 24, 2009 first amended complaint. Furthermore, the
 
November 26, 2013 Minute Order, which addresses the court's
 rationale with regard to the first amended complaint, presages
 the court's thinking with regard to the substantially-similar
 Second Amended Complaint. In relevant part, the Minute Order
 explains that the first and second counts of the Tabuyos' first
 amended complaint "were not plead with sufficient specificity and
 particularity as required by HRCP Rule 9(b)," and with respect to
 count seven, that the Tabuyos "failed to submit evidence that
 defendants misrepresented the terms of the loan." (Emphasis
 added.)
 
The Tabuyos do not point to any other evidence to
 
support their implied contention that the Circuit Court dismissed
 Counts I and II of the Second Amended Complaint for a different
 reason than it stated in the November 26, 2013 Minute Order with
 regard to the first amended complaint. As such, the Tabuyos have
 failed to demonstrate that the Circuit Court did, in fact, apply
 the Enriquez standard to evaluate the Second Amended Complaint,
 and therefore we need not determine whether the Enriquez standard
 is correct. Instead, we evaluate whether the fraud allegations
 in the Second Amended Complaint were stated with sufficient
 particularity to satisfy HRCP Rule 9(b). 
(1)(b) We reject the Tabuyos' contention that the
 
Circuit Court erred by dismissing the allegations in Count I
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 9(b), because in their Second Amended
 Complaint, the Tabuyos failed to articulate what specific
 (mis)representations, if any, the Reishs made about the Loan.
6/
 
In their May 13, 2014 memorandum opposing the Reishs'
 
MTD/MSJ on the Second Amended Complaint, the Tabuyos asserted
 that "COUNTS I AND II, STANDING ALONE, ONLY ALLEGE FRAUD
 GENERALLY". Rule 9(b) of the HRCP states that "[i]n all
 
6/
 Although the Tabuyos filed a "Supplemental Affidavit of Merlina D.
Tabuyo in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative
Motion for Summary Judgment on the First Amended Complaint Filed on
September 24, 2009" ("Supplemental Affidavit"), they did not include the
affidavit or any information from the affidavit in any court filing associated
with the Reishs' MTD/MSJ of the Second Amended Complaint. Irrespective of
whether the Supplemental Affidavit was specific enough to satisfy HRCP Rule
9(b), that detail was not included in the Second Amended Complaint.

averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting 
fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity." Thus, plaintiffs suing for fraud in the State of Hawai
'i "must 
. . . allege who made the false representations[] and specify the representations made." Niau v. Quick Loan Funding, No. CAAP-12­
0000474, 2015 WL 1360823, at *5 (Hawai
'i App. Mar. 25, 2015) 
(quoting Agard v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., No. CAAP–13–0002872, 2015 WL 337254, at *2 (Hawai
'i App. Jan. 26, 
2015), cert. denied, No. SCWC–13–0002872, 2015 WL 3649493, at *1 (Hawai
'i June 8, 2015)). Even though the Second Amended 
Complaint arguably identified the Reishs as the party who made false representations regarding the Loan, it was insufficient under HRCP Rule 9(b) for failing to specify what those representations were. Id. 
Below, the Tabuyos argued that "the FACTS section 
(pages 3 – 5) [of the] Second Amended Complaint constitutes a statement of the circumstances constituting fraud as required by HRCP Rule 9(b)." While a single paragraph of the Second Amended Complaint eludes to possible (mis)representations, on which an action for fraud must be based, Ex rel. Louie, 133 Hawai
'i at 407 
n.33, 328 P.3d at 416 n.33 ("[In Hawai 'i, a] claim for fraud 
involves 'a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment." (quoting Fisher v. Grove Farm Co., 123 Hawai
'i 82, 
116, 230 P.3d 382, 416 (App. 2009) (brackets omitted))), the Second Amended Complaint contains no allegations regarding the content of any representations the Tabuyos may have relied on to their detriment. Cf., e.g., Niau, 2015 WL 1360823, at *6 
(affirming summary judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 9(b) where the plaintiffs-appellants "provided various documents related to the Note and Mortgage, [yet] they d[id] not point to any evidence to support their allegations or specify where in the included documents the [alleged] violations occurred"). 
On appeal, the Tabuyos also argue that, on a "general
 
basis," the Reishs misrepresented themselves by "h[olding]
 themselves out to be law-abiding and otherwise reputable people." 
However, even if the Tabuyos had properly preserved the argument
 
5
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
below,7/ this contention is meritless. The Tabuyos did not 
allege that the Reishs affirmatively represented themselves to 
the Tabuyos or their agent, Sylvain Lacasse, as "law-abiding and otherwise reputable" in the Second Amended Complaint. See 
generally Black's Law Dictionary, 1494, 1152 (10th ed. 2014) (defining a "false representation," or "misrepresentation," as "[t]he act . . . of making a false or misleading assertion about something, usu[ally] with the intent to deceive"). Rather, the Second Amended Complaint merely states that the Reishs have been "doing business as unlicensed private lenders" in Hawai
'i. 
However, the Tabuyos provide no authority, and we know of none, stating that a party's general act of entering into a loan agreement necessarily constitutes a "representation" by that party that he or she is "law-abiding and otherwise reputable." See, e.g., Miyashiro v. Roehrig, Roehrig, Wilson & Hara, 122 Hawai
'i 461, 483, 228 P.3d 341, 363 (App. 2010) (affirming 
summary judgment where there was "no evidence of a representation or misrepresentation that [the plaintiff] relied upon to his detriment"). Thus, the Circuit Court did not err when it determined that Count I of the Second Amended Complaint does not comply with HRCP Rule 9(b). 
(1)(c) In further support of its first point of error, 
the opening brief also states that the Circuit Court erred by failing to "properly apply the [Motion for Summary Judgment] standards to the facts of this case. . . ." Specifically, the Tabuyos allege that "[t]he inferences the lower court made were not done in the light most favorable to the Tabuyos," and that the Reishs, as movants, "produced insufficient evidence to meet [Hawai
'i's] stringent burden of proof" for summary judgment. We 
disagree. 
As noted above, we construe the Reishs' MTD/MSJ of the 
Second Amended Complaint as a motion for summary judgment, see Foytik, 88 Hawai
'i at 313, 966 P.2d at 625; Wong, 111 Hawai 'i at 
7/
 See generally Lales v. Wholesale Motors, Co., 133 Hawai' i 332,
343 n.9, 328 P.3d 341, 352 n.9 (2014) ("Legal issues not raised in the trial
court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal." (quoting Kau v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 104 Hawai' i 468, 474 n.6, 92 P.3d 477, 483 n.6 (2004) (internal
quotation marks omitted))).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
476, 143 P.3d at 15, and we therefore review the Second MTD/MSJ 
Order de novo. Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai 'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 
689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai
'i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). Here, there 
is no indication that the result hinged on the existence or nonexistence of some material fact. See generally Thomas v. 
Kidani, 126 Hawai
'i 125, 129, 267 P.3d 1230, 1234 (2011) ("A fact 
is material if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by [one of] the parties." (quoting Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai
'i 116, 136, 19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001))). 
Rather, as explained above, the record implies that, like the first amended complaint, the court dismissed the Second Amended Complaint because its claims were not pled with sufficient particularity. And, indeed, "[w]here, as here, the moving party is the defendant and does not bear the burden of proof at trial, he may prevail on a motion for summary judgment by demonstrating that the plaintiff 'fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.'" Id. at 130, 267 P.3d at 1235 (quoting Exotics Hawaii-
Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai
'i 277, 
302, 172 P.3d 1021, 1046 (2007)). 
Thus, we need not evaluate the sufficiency of evidence 
that the Reishs, as movants, produced in support of their motion. Id.; see Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058, 1080 (9th Cir. 2008) (affirming an award of summary judgment without considering the sufficiency of the movant's evidence where "the complaint d[id] not include the necessary factual allegations to state a [specific] claim") (citing, inter alia, Wasco Prods., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc., 435 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2006) ("'Simply put, summary judgment is not a procedural second chance to flesh out inadequate pleadings.'" (quoting another source)), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1281 (2009). See also, e.g., Miyashiro, 
122 Hawai
'i at 483, 228 P.3d at 363 (affirming summary judgment 
where plaintiff-appellant's "vague allegations of fraud and conspiracy [were] not legally sufficient" because he "failed to 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
adduce evidence supporting each of the elements" of those
 
claims).
 
Furthermore, the Reishs presented evidence in their
 
MTD/MSJ of the Second Amended Complaint that the Tabuyos did not
 rely on any specific representations made by the Reishs in
 entering into the Loan, and the Tabuyos did not present any
 contrary evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. See
 
id. (discussing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322
 (1986) (holding that the defendant summary judgment movant is
 entitled to summary judgment if it shows that the plaintiff/non­moving party cannot establish all essential elements on which he
 or she bears the burden the proof at trial))).
 
Therefore, we hold that the Tabuyos' first point of
 
error fails.
 
(2) Regarding Count II of the Second Amended Complaint,
 
the Tabuyos asked the Circuit Court to render the Loan
 transaction "void and unenforceable as procured by deceit,
 misrepresentation, illegality and criminality . . . ." As noted
 above, this contention is nearly identical to the second count of
 the Tabuyos' first amended complaint, which the Circuit Court
 dismissed for failure to comply with HRCP Rule 9(b). The Tabuyos
 "do[] not add any new factual allegations" to their claim in
 Count II, nor do they advance any new legal argument on the
 subject. Smallwood v. NCsoft Corp., 730 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1233
 
(D. Haw. 2010). Accordingly, we find that Count II fails to
 comply with HRCP Rule 9(b) for the same reasons as Count I, and
 the Circuit Court therefore did not err by disposing of that
 claim. Id.
 
(3) The Tabuyos' final argument is that there was a 
sufficient basis for their request for punitive damages against the Reishs in Count III of the Second Amended Complaint. "A claim for punitive damages is[, however,] . . . purely incidental to a separate cause of action." Fisher, 123 Hawai
'i at 119, 230 
P.3d at 419 (original brackets omitted) (quoting Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co. (Hawai
'i), 76 Hawai 'i 454, 466, 879 P.2d 1037, 1049 
(1994)). As such, "[p]unitive damages . . . cannot form an independent claim" on which the Tabuyos may sue, Smallwood, 730 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
F. Supp. 2d at 1236 (citing Ross, 76 Hawai 'i at 466, 879 P.2d at 
1049; Television Events & Mktg., Inc. v. AMCON Distrib. Co., 488 
F. Supp. 2d 1071, 1083 (D. Haw. 2006)), so we affirm the Circuit
 Court's disposition of Count III of the Second Amended Complaint.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Granting
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion for
 Summary Judgment on the Second Amended Complaint Filed on
 February 10, 2014 and Order to Expunge Notice of Pendency of
 Action," "Judgment," and the "Notice of Entry of Judgment," all
 of which were filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on
 August 5, 2014, are affirmed.
