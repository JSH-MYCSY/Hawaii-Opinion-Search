(By:

Defendants/Counterclaimants/Appellants Bernardita
 
Montero Mazerik and Bedinah Doldolea Villafranca (together,
Appellants) appeal from the Judgment entered on August 19, 2014
 
1
in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Appellants raise the following points of
 
error:
 
1
 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) The circuit court erred in denying Appellants'
 
motion to dismiss, which sought to dismiss the complaint for
 
foreclosure filed by Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee
 the Bank of New York Mellon FKA The Bank of New York as Trustee
 for the Certificate-Holders of CWMBS, Inc., CHL Mortgage Pass-
Through Trust 2007-14 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
 2007-14 (BNYM);
 
(2) The circuit court erred in dismissing Appellant's
 
counterclaims against BNYM; and
 
(3) The circuit court erred in dismissing Appellant's
 
amended counterclaims against BNYM.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Appellants' appeal is without merit.
I. Motion to Dismiss BNYM's Complaint for Foreclosure 
Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in 
denying their motion to dismiss BNYM's complaint for foreclosure. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2015) provides 
that "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final 
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate court[.]" (Emphasis added.). "[Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 54(b) 
specifies the manner in which an appeal under HRS § 641-1(a) is to be taken in a multiple claims or multiple parties case." TBS 
Pac., Inc. v. Tamura, 5 Haw. App. 222, 228, 686 P.2d 37, 43 (1984); see HRS § 641-1(c) (1993) ("An appeal shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court."). HRCP Rule 54 provides: 
Rule 54. JUDGMENTS; COSTS; ATTORNEYS' FEES.
 
(a) Definition; form. "Judgment" as used in these
rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal
lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings,
the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.
 
(b) Judgment upon multiple claims or involving
multiple parties. When more than one claim for relief is
 presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim,
cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final
judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims
or parties only upon an express determination that there is
no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for
the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination
and direction, any order or other form of decision, however
designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or
the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties
shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or
parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject
to revision at any time before the entry of judgment
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities
of all the parties.
 
"[W]hen an appeal is taken from such a [HRCP Rule 54(b)]
 
judgment, the trial court is divested of jurisdiction with
 respect to the claim as to which the judgment was entered but it
 retains jurisdiction over the remainder of the case." Territory
 
by Choy v. Damon, 44 Haw. 557, 563, 356 P.2d 386, 390 (1960). 
The circuit court's Judgment was entered pursuant to
 
HRCP Rule 54(b) and disposed of Appellants' counterclaims against
 BNYM, but did not dispose of BNYM's foreclosure claims against
 Appellants. The Judgment specifically states, "This Judgment
 does not dispose of all claims or all parties as BNYM's claim
 against [Appellants], jointly and severally, for a confirmation
 of sale and a deficiency judgment will be entered, as
 appropriate, after sale or upon closing of the sale yet to be
 confirmed." In addition, the circuit court had not disposed of
 or entered a separate judgment for the claims raised in BNYM's
 complaint for foreclosure at the time that Appellants filed their
 appeal. Because the circuit court's Judgment only divested the
 circuit court of jurisdiction with respect to Appellants'
 counterclaims, but retained jurisdiction over the claims raised
 in BNYM's complaint for foreclosure, we do not have jurisdiction
 to review the circuit court's order denying Appellants' motion to
 dismiss BNYM's complaint for foreclosure. See Damon, 44 Haw. at
 
563, 356 P.2d at 390. 
II. Motion to Dismiss Appellants' Counterclaims
 
The circuit court granted BNYM's motion to dismiss
 
Appellants' counterclaims for wrongful foreclosure, declaratory
 judgment, quiet title, and unfair and deceptive trade practices
 (UDAP). On appeal, Appellants argue that their counterclaims
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were well-pled and, therefore, the circuit court erred in
 
granting BNYM's motion to dismiss.2
 
HRCP Rule 8(a) states: "A pleading which sets forth a
 
claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-
claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain
 statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
 relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader
 seeks." To satisfy HRCP Rule 8(a)(1), the pleading "must contain
 either direct allegations on every material point necessary to
 sustain a recovery on any legal theory, even though it may not be
 the theory suggested or intended by the pleader, or contain
 allegations from which an inference fairly may be drawn that
 evidence on these material points will be introduced at trial." 
Marsland v. Pang , 5 Haw. App. 463, 475, 701 P.2d 175, 186 (1985)
 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
A pleading that fails to satisfy HRCP Rule 8(a) may be
 
3
dismissed pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6)  for failure to state a
2
 Appellants also argue that they were entitled to attorneys' fees,
under HRCP Rule 11, for the time Appellants' attorneys spent preparing a
response to an earlier motion BNYM filed, but then later withdrew.
Appellants, however, did not file a motion for HRCP Rule 11 sanctions below
and, therefore, cannot now argue that the circuit court erred in not granting
sanctions. See HRCP Rule 11(c)(1)(A) ("A motion for sanctions under this rule
shall be made separately from other motions or requests and shall describe the
specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b) [of HRCP Rule 11].").
 
3
 HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) provides:
 
Rule 12. DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS -- WHEN AND HOW
 
PRESENTED -- BY PLEADING OR MOTION -- MOTION FOR
 JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS.
 
. . . .

 
(b) How presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to a
claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim,
counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be
asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is
required, except that the following defenses may at the
option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . (6)
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted[.] . . . If, on a motion asserting the defense
numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state
a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside
the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,
the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and
disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be
given reasonable opportunity to present all material made
pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claim upon which relief can be granted, however, it is well
 
established that
 
[a] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can
prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that
would entitle him or her to relief. We must therefore view
 a plaintiff's complaint in a light most favorable to him or
her in order to determine whether the allegations contained
therein could warrant relief under any alternative theory.
For this reason, in reviewing a circuit court's order
dismissing a complaint our consideration is strictly limited
to the allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those
allegations to be true.
 
In re Estate of Rogers , 103 Hawai 'i 275, 280-81, 81 P.3d 1190, 
1195-96 (2003) (citations, brackets in original, and ellipsis
 
omitted) (quoting Blair v. Ing, 95 Hawai 'i 247, 252, 21 P.3d 452, 
457 (2001)). "[I]n weighing the allegations of the complaint as
 against a motion to dismiss, the court is not required to accept
 conclusory allegations on the legal effect of the events
 alleged." Marsland, 5 Haw. App. at 474, 701 P.2d at 186.
 
While a complaint attacked by [an HRCP] Rule 12(b)(6) motion
to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a
plaintiff's obligation to provide the "grounds" of his
"entitlement to relief" requires more than labels and
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a
cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be
enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative
level on the assumption that all of the complaint's
allegations are true (even if doubtful in fact).
 
Pavsek v. Sandvold, 127 Hawai 'i 390, 403, 279 P.3d 55, 68 (App. 
2012) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 
(2007)). 
A. Wrongful Foreclosure
 
Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing their wrongful foreclosure counterclaim. Appellants
 asserted a counterclaim for wrongful foreclosure based on their
 belief that they were the legal owners of the property that
 BNYM's sought to foreclose. Appellants challenged the assignment
 of their mortgage and argued that, "if the note and mortgage were
 transferred into a trust and securitized," then such a transfer
 violated the trust's pooling and service agreement (PSA), thereby
 
invalidating any purported transfer. This court has held that
 
"borrowers do not have standing to challenge the validity of an
 assignment of its loans because they are not parties to the
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreement and because noncompliance with a trust's governing
 
document is irrelevant to the assignee's standing to foreclose." 
U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175, 338 
P.3d 1185, 1190 (App. 2014). Therefore, even viewing Appellants' allegations in the light most favorable to them, Appellants wrongful foreclosure counterclaim failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and the circuit court did not err in dismissing their counterclaim. See Pavsek, 127 Hawai
'i at 
403, 279 P.3d at 68. 
B. Declaratory Judgment 
Appellants contend the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing their counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, which
 challenged the validity of the assignment of their mortgage from
 Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) to BNYM.
 
Appellants' declaratory judgment counterclaim requested the
 
circuit court "decide and declare that MERS was not the mortgagee
 on the mortgage and that it was a sham and fraud, and that MERS
 acted only as a strawman[,]" which we interpret as an allegation
 of fraud. 
HRCP Rule 9(b) provides, "In all averments of
 
fraud . . . the circumstances constituting fraud . . . shall be
 stated with particularity." "The rule is designed, in part, to
 insure the particularized information necessary for a defendant
 to prepare an effective defense to a claim which embraces a wide
 variety of potential conduct." Larsen v. Pacesetter Sys., Inc.,
 
74 Haw. 1, 30, 837 P.2d 1273, 1288 (1992) (citation omitted). 
Therefore, "under [HRCP] Rule 9(b), general allegations of
 'fraud' are insufficient because they serve little or no
 informative function, rather, a plaintiff must state the
 circumstances constituting fraud or mistake with particularity
 (e.g., allege who made the false representations) and specify the
 representations made." Id.
 at 30-31, 837 P.2d at 1288.
 
(citations omitted). Having failed to state particularized
 allegations regarding the circumstances constituting fraud, the
 circuit court dismissal of declaratory judgment counterclaim was
 not erroneous. 
See id.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C. Quiet Title
 
Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing their counterclaim for quiet title. Appellants'
 
counterclaim states that, as the owner of the property being
 foreclosed upon, they are entitled to "have their legal title
 quieted against the claims of [BNYM]" pursuant to HRS § 669-1
 (1993).
 
HRS § 669-1(a) provides that a quiet title action "may 
be brought by any person against another person who claims, or who may claim adversely to the plaintiff, an estate or interest in real property, for the purpose of determining the adverse claim." Appellants' quiet title action required a showing that they had a substantial interest in the property and that their title was superior to that of BNYM. See Maui Land & Pineapple 
Co. v. Infiesto, 76 Hawai
'i 402, 408, 879 P.2d 507, 513 (1994) 
("While it is not necessary for the plaintiff to have perfect title to establish a prima facie [quiet title] case, he must at least prove that he has a substantial interest in the property and that his title is superior to that of the defendants."). Therefore, "[i]n order for mortgagors to quiet title against the mortgagee, the mortgagors must establish that they are the rightful owners of the property and they have paid, or are able to pay, the amount of their indebtedness." Caraang v. PNC 
Mortg., 795 F.Supp.2d 1098, 1126 (D. Haw. 2011) (citing Phillips v. Bank of America, 2011 WL 240813, at *13 (D. Haw. Jan. 21,
 2011)) (interpreting HRS § 669-1); Ramos v. Chase Home Fin., 810
 F.Supp.2d 1125, 1143 (D. Haw. 2011) ("[I]n order to assert a
 claim for 'quiet title' against a mortgagee, a borrower must
 allege they have paid, or are able to tender, the amount of
 indebtedness.").
 
Citing Amina v. Bank of New York Mellon, 2012 WL
 
3283513 (D. Haw. Aug. 9, 2012), Appellants argue that "the
 borrower does not need to tender payment or allege that the
 promissory note and mortgage were paid where the borrower brings
 a quiet title action against a party, who, according to the
 complaint, is not a mortgagee." (Emphasis omitted.) Appellants'
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reliance on Amina is misplaced and ignores a critical
 
clarification in the Amina holding, which states:
 
To be clear . . . this is not a case where Plaintiffs assert
 
that Defendant's mortgagee status is invalid (for example,
because the mortgage loan was securitized or because
Defendant does not hold the note). On their own, such
allegations would be insufficient to assert a quiet title
claim – they admit that a defendant is a mortgagee and
attack the weakness of the mortgagee's claim to the property
without establishing the strength and superiority of the
borrower's claim (by asserting an ability to tender).
 
Id. at *5 (emphasis added); see Bank of America, N.A v. Hermano, 
No. CAAP-13-0006069 at *4 (App. June 22, 2016) (SDO) (holding that appellant's nearly identical argument, which also relied upon a misreading of the holding in Amina, was misplaced). Appellants' counterclaim did not allege that they paid, or were able to pay, the outstanding debt on their property so as to demonstrate the superiority of their claim. Appellants argument is, therefore, without merit and the circuit court did not err in dismissing their quiet title counterclaim. See Pavsek, 127 
Hawai
'i at 403, 279 P.3d at 68. 
D. UDAP
 
Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing their UDAP counterclaim, which was made pursuant to
 HRS § 480-2 (2008 Repl.).
 
HRS § 480-2(a) provides that "[u]nfair methods of 
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." "[A] deceptive act or practice is (1) a representation, omission, or practice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances where (3) the representation, omission, or practice is material." Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 
Hawai
'i 254, 262, 141 P.3d 427, 435 (2006) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted) (quoting FTC v. Verity Int'l, Ltd., 443 F.3d 48, 63 (2d. Cir. 2006)). Furthermore, "[a] representation, omission, or practice is considered 'material' if it involves 'information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product." Courbat, 111 Hawai
'i at 262, 141 P.3d at 435 (internal 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 223 F.3d
 
783, 786 (D.C. Cir. 2000)). 
Appellants' UDAP counterclaim alleges that "[t]he acts
 
and conduct of [BNYM], its agents, predecessors, and MERS
 constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice in the conduct
 of their trade or commerce as either or both mortgage lenders,
 mortgage servicers, mortgage holders, or claimants, debt
 collectors, and/or finance companies." Appellants' UDAP
 counterclaim appears to be based on their theory that BNYM was
 attempting to wrongfully foreclose upon Appellants' mortgage.
 
Notably absent from Appellants' UDAP counterclaim is 
any factual allegations detailing if and when Appellants were misled by BNYM's or MERS' purported actions, so as to identify the grounds for Appellants' UDAP relief. See Pavsek, 127 Hawai
'i 
at 403, 279 P.3d at 68. Because Appellants did not allege facts that could form the basis of Appellants' UDAP claim, Appellants failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and the circuit court did not err in dismissing their counterclaim. See id. 
III. Motion to Dismiss Appellants' Amended
Counterclaims
 
Appellants also argue that the circuit court erred in
 
granting BYNM's motion to dismiss Appellants' amended
 
counterclaims for wrongful foreclosure, UDAP violation, and quiet
 title.
 
A. Wrongful Foreclosure
 
Appellants' wrongful foreclosure claim challenged
 
various assignments of their mortgage on the grounds that (1)
 MERS' transfer of Appellants' mortgage violated the terms of the
 securitized trust's PSA and (2) the instrument assigning the
 mortgage was signed by a "robo-signer."
 
First, as we previously held, "borrowers do not have
 
standing to challenge the validity of an assignment of its loans
 because they are not parties to the agreement and because
 noncompliance with a trust's governing document is irrelevant to
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the assignee's standing to foreclose." Salvacion, 134 Hawai 'i at 
175, 338 P.3d at 1190. 
Second, Appellants asserted no factual allegations as
 
to how the alleged robo-signing caused them harm and, therefore,
 
Appellants' bare allegation of robo-signing fails to state a
 claim upon which relief can be granted. See U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n
 
v. Benoist, No. CAAP–14–0001176 at *4 (App. Nov. 12, 2015) (SDO)
 ("[C]onclusory assertions of 'robo-signing' fail to state a
 plausible claim." (quoting Lee v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys.,
 Inc. [MERS], 2012 WL 2467085, at *5 (D. Haw. June 27, 2012)));
 see also Nottage v. Bank of New York Mellon, 2012 WL 5305506, at
 *6 (D. Haw. Oct. 25, 2012) (summarizing case law where courts
 have rejected the "robo-signing" argument). 
The circuit court did not err in dismissing Appellants' 
amended wrongful foreclosure counterclaim. See Pavsek, 127 
Hawai
'i at 403, 279 P.3d at 68. 
B. UDAP
 
Like the original counterclaim, Appellants' amended 
counterclaim includes the bare allegation that "[t]he acts and conduct of [BNYM], its agents, predecessors, and MERS constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice in the conduct of the business or trade by [BNYM] as either or both mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers, mortgage holders or claimants, debt collectors, and/or finance companies." Again, Appellants' UDAP counterclaim appears to be based on the theory that BNYM was attempting to wrongfully foreclose on Appellants' mortgage, and their counterclaim fails to allege if and how they were misled. See Courbat, 111 Hawai
'i at 262, 141 P.3d at 435. Therefore, the 
circuit court did not err in dismissing Appellants' amended UDAP counterclaim. See Pavsek, 127 Hawai
'i at 403, 279 P.3d at 68. 
C. Quiet Title
 
Appellants amended quiet title counterclaim alleged
 
that BNYM was "not the owner and/or holder of [Appellants']
 mortgage loan" and sought to quiet the title to their property.
 Like Appellants' original quiet title counterclaim, Appellants'
 amended quiet claim counterclaim again does not allege that they
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
paid or were able to pay their outstanding loan balance so as to 
indicate that they had superiority in title. See Ramos, 810 
F.Supp.2d at 1143; see also Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 76 Hawai 'i 
at 408, 879 P.2d at 513. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in dismissing Appellants' amended quiet title counterclaim. See Pavsek, 127 Hawai
'i at 403, 279 P.3d at 68. 
IV. Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Equal
Protection
 
On appeal, Appellants argue that, "[b]y granting 
summary judgment to [BNYM] and dismissing Appellants' 
counterclaims, the Circuit Court violated their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by denying them property, possession, and ownership interests." "The basic elements of procedural due process of law require notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Price v. Zoning Bd. Of Appeals of City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 77 Hawai
'i 168, 172, 883 P.2d 629, 633 (1994) (quoting 
Evans v. Takao, 74 Haw. 267, 282, 842 P.2d 255, 262 (1992)). "[T]he manner in which the justice system operates must be fair and must also appear to be fair." Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of 
Land & Nat. Res., 136 Hawai
'i 376, 389, 363 P.3d 224, 237 (2015) 
(citing Sifagaloa v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai
'i, 74 Haw. 181, 190, 840 P.2d 367, 371 (1992)). 
Appellants provide no argument for how the dismissal of
 
their counterclaims and amended counterclaims violated their due
 process rights. The record indicates that Appellants were given
 notice and opportunities to be heard throughout the circuit court
 proceedings, as evidenced by the two oppositions that Appellants
 filed in response to BNYM's motions to dismiss and the two
 hearings that the circuit court held before granting BNYM's
 motions.
4 Appellants due process argument is without merit. 
Therefore,
 
4
 We note that Appellants did not include the transcripts of the
hearings in the record on appeal.
