NO. CAAP-14-0001105
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAMES MCDANIEL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-0755(1))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER
 
CAAP-14-0001105 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant James
 
McDaniel's (Appellant) appeal from the Honorable Rhonda I.L.
 Loo's June 18, 2014 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence
 (Judgment) because Appellant's notice of appeal was untimely
 filed.
 
On April 11, 2014, in conjunction with a plea agreement
 
with the Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaii (State) and with the
 advice of counsel, Appellant entered a plea of no contest to a
 single count of Theft in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-831(1)(b) in exchange for the
 dismissal of two other counts of Theft in the Second Degree. On
 June 18, 2014, the Circuit Court sentenced Appellant to a four-
year term of probation with special conditions, including one day
 of imprisonment, restitution, and community service. Appellant
 was present at this sentencing hearing and made a presentence
 statement. In announcing its sentence, the Circuit Court stated
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the conditions of probation it was imposing.1 On July 23, 2014,
 
Appellant met with his probation officer who presented him with
 
the written conditions of probation.
 
On September 5, 2014, Appellant, pro se, filed a Notice
 
of Appeal and tendered a Motion and Memorandum for an Extension
 of Time for the Individual Defendant to File Notice of Appeal
 (Motion). In his Motion, Appellant claimed that he did not
 receive a copy of the "sentence" until July 23, 2014, and that
 the sentence was not in agreement with the plea offer. It
 appears that this Motion was granted.
 
HRS § 641-11 (2016) provides that "[a]ny party
 
aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter
 may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
 chapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided by the
 rules of the court. The sentence of the court in a criminal case
 shall be the judgment." Theft in the Second Degree is a class C
 felony. HRS § 708-831(2) (2014). A person convicted of a
 class C felony may be imprisoned for up to 5 years. HRS § 706­660 (2014). Therefore, this is a criminal matter and the
 June 18, 2014 Judgment was an appealable judgment pursuant to HRS
 § 641-11.
 
A notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of a 
final judgment. See Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(b). An extension of time to file a notice of appeal may be granted "no later than 30 days after the time has expired . . . for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed[.]" HRAP Rule 4(b)(5). In other words, Appellant could have received permission to file his notice of appeal up to sixty days after the June 18, 2014 Judgment.
2 However, Appellant's Notice of Appeal was filed and 
his Motion was received by the Circuit Court on September 5, 
1
 The minutes of these proceedings state that Appellant "executed
mandatory special conditions and copy of same given to [Appellant.]"
 
2
 While the circuit court may have granted Appellant's motion for an
extension of time to file a notice of appeal, it was not authorized to do so.
Appellant's Motion was both untimely and sought an extension of time that
exceeded the maximum allowed by the rule. HRAP Rule 4(b)(5).

2014, seventy-nine days after entry of the June 18, 2014
 
Judgment, and was thus untimely.
 
Nevertheless, there are two recognized exceptions to
 
the general requirement that a notice of appeal must be timely
 filed.
 
In criminal cases, we have made exceptions to the
requirement that notices of appeal be timely filed. Our
recognized exceptions involve circumstances where:
(1) defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failedto pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction inthe first instance; State v. Knight, 80 Hawai' i 318, 323-24,
909 P.2d 1133, 1138-39 (1996); or (2) the trial court'sdecision was unannounced and no notice of the entry ofjudgment was ever provided; State v. Ferreira, 59 Haw. 255,580 P.2d 63 (1978). 
State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai 'i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998). 
The failure to bring an appeal on a criminal
 
defendant's behalf does not constitute ineffective assistance of
 
counsel per se.  Castellanos v. United States, 26 F.3d 717, 719
 
(7th Cir. 1994). Rather, essential to the claim of ineffective
 assistance of counsel is that the client has informed his or her
 attorney of this request. Castellanos, id,(remanding for a
 
hearing on whether the request to appeal was made to counsel),
 and Yodprasit v. United States, 294 F.3d 966, 969 (8th Cir. 2002)
 (affirming the habeas corpus court's credibility determination
 that the request was not communicated to counsel). Appellant
 concedes as much in his opening brief.
 
Here, Judgment was entered against Appellant after he
 
had entered a no contest plea and immediately after he was
 present with counsel and engaged in a dialogue with the Circuit
 Court at sentencing. In response to an Order to Show Cause
 issued by this court, Appellant's counsel, Cary Virtue (counsel),
 stated that Appellant did not inform him that Appellant wished to
 appeal his sentence and that counsel was not aware of this appeal
 until he received the Order to Show Cause. In his Motion,
 Appellant stated that upon his receipt of the written copy of
 "the Sentence" on July 23, 2014, he "attempted to contact my
 attorney to initiate an appeal of the sentence. I was unable to
 make contact with the attorney . . . ." But Appellant did not
 explain why he was unable to do so. Thus, it appears that
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Appellant did not request that counsel bring an appeal on
 
Appellant's behalf.
 
Appellant has failed to even allege he communicated his
 
desire to appeal to counsel and he has failed to establish that
 his counsel's failure to timely perfect his appeal was due to
 ineffective assistance. Thus, Appellant has failed to show that
 he falls within the exception to the requirement that a notice of
 appeal be timely filed due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Therefore, this appeal is dismissed for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction, without prejudice to Appellant raising the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in a petition under Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40.
