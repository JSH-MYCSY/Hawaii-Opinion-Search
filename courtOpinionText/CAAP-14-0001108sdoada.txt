 2On appeal, Maddox raises the following issues:
1

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
 
2
 Maddox's opening brief included both "Questions on Appeal" and
"Statement of Error," and the issues he raised in these sections are treated
as points of error.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) it was error to not arraign Maddox until over four­
and-a-half months after his indictment in Cr. No. 07-1-0139;
 
(2) Maddox was entitled to assistance of counsel on his
 
appeal in Cr. No. 07-1-0139;
 
(3) the circuit court committed structural error in not
 
providing Maddox with assistance of counsel on his appeal in Cr.
 
No. 07-1-0139;
 
(4) Maddox's appeal was dismissed due to errors
 
committed by the circuit court;
 
(5) the circuit court committed error by not filing 
documents submitted in support of Maddox's Hawai 'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 "Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody" (Rule 40 
Petition); 
(6) the circuit court committed error by not filing
 
submitted documents and motions in support of Maddox's petition
 
until it had denied the petition;
 
(7) Maddox's attorney was ineffective;
 (8) the circuit court wrongfully denied Maddox's HRPP
 
Rule 40 Petition; 
(9) the circuit court erred in not dismissing Cr. No.
 
09-1-0284;
 
(10) Maddox was corporally punished and prosecution
 
continued after the illegal punishment;
 
(11) Maddox's corporal punishment violated Hawai
'i law; 
(12) Maddox was entitled to assistance of counsel until
 
the termination of Cr. No. 07-1-0139;
 
(13) the circuit court erred in failing to provide
 
notice to Maddox of the order dismissing Cr. No. 07-1-0139;
 
(14) the circuit court failed to correct Maddox's
 
illegal sentence under HRPP Rules 35 and 40;

half months after the indictment in violation of Hawaii Revised

violation of the Sixth Amendment of the United States

2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(17) the circuit court failed to enter an order
 
terminating jurisdiction of the case in Cr. No. 07-1-0139;
 
(18) the circuit court failed to rule on Maddox's
 
"Motion to Release and Discharge from Custody; Dismiss with
 
Prejudice";
 
(19) the circuit court erred in expanding its
 
jurisdiction over Maddox as he was held in custody for weeks
 following the dismissal of Cr. No. 07-1-0139 in violation of HRS
 § 602-11;
 
(20) Maddox was denied assistance of counsel after his
 
"Motion for Assistance of Counsel on first and only appeal";
 
(21) Maddox's counsel was ineffective, committed 
illegal acts and lied to Maddox in violation of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawai
'i Constitution; 
(22) Maddox suferred illegal corporal punishment;
 (23) Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) 
performed knowing malicious prosecution; 
(24) the State's bad actions were evidence of
 
violations of Contempt of Court under HRS § 710-1077;
 
(25) Maddox's due process rights were violated on the
 
basis that he was "never arrested, not timely arraigned, not
 provided due notice, equal protections, delayed execution of
 warrant(s), corporally punished, double jeopardy, denied counsel,
 jurisdiction, [and] arraigned in Family Court, etc.";
 
(26) the family court lacked jurisdiction to arraign
 
Maddox in Cr. No. 09-1-0284;
 
(27) "[m]ultiple dates are now missing from the record,
 
and have been removed in an effort to cover past wrongs";
 
(28) the circuit court erroneously found that Maddox
 
had waived his claims to errors in Cr. No. 07-1-0139 based on his
 plea agreement in Cr. No. 09-1-0284;
 
(29) the circuit court has denied filing documents
 
submitted by Maddox in violation of HRPP Rules 42(e) and 49(f);
 and
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(30) Maddox was held in custody illegally prior to May
 
14-15, 2009.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Maddox's
 appeal is without merit.
HRPP Rule 40 Post-Conviction Relief
 
HRPP Rule 40 relief is not available to Maddox. HRPP
 
Rule 40(a)(3) provides: 
(3) INAPPLICABILITY. Rule 40 proceedings shall not be
available and relief thereunder shall not be granted where
the issues sought to be raised have been previously ruled
upon or were waived. Except for a claim of illegal
sentence, an issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and
understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been
raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under
this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the
petitioner's failure to raise the issue. There is a
 rebuttable presumption that a failure to appeal a ruling or
to raise an issue is a knowing and understanding failure.
 
To grant HRPP Rule 40 relief, a "court must first determine 
whether a petitioner has rebutted the presumption of a knowing and intelligent failure to raise an issue. If the presumption is not rebutted, then the court determines whether the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifies the failure to have previously raised the claim." Fagaragan v. State, 132 Hawai
'i 
224, 237, 320 P.3d 889, 902 (2014). 
In evaluating Maddox's HRPP Rule 40 Petition, the
 
circuit court concluded that the issues Maddox raised had been
 previously raised and ruled upon in Cr. No. 09-1-0284. Maddox
 did not appeal from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation
 Sentence entered on August 30, 2010 in Cr. No. 09-1-0284. Upon a
 thorough review of the record, which includes the records in Cr.
 Nos. 07-1-0139 and 09-1-0284, we conclude that all the claims for
 relief raised by Maddox in his HRPP Rule 40 Petition have been
 previously ruled upon or have been waived. Accordingly, Maddox
 was not entitled to relief on these claims.
