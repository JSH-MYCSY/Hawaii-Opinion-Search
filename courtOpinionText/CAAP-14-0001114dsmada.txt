dismissal is authorized by HRAP Rule 42(a), which allows parties
 
to file a stipulation to dismiss an appeal before the appeal is
 docketed; and (4) the parties agree to bear their own costs and
 attorney's fees on appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to
 
dismiss the appeal is approved and the appeal is dismissed with
 prejudice. The parties shall bear their own appellate costs and
 attorney's fees.
