OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ALBERT KAZUMI AKAHOSHI, aka Albert K. Akahoshi,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-14-022586)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Albert Kazumi Akahoshi, aka Albert
 
K. Akahoshi, pro se, appeals from a Notice of Entry of Judgment
 
and/or Order, which was filed in the District Court of the Third
 Circuit, North and South Hilo Division ("District Court"),
1 on
 
August 14, 2014. The District Court found that Akahoshi
 committed the offense of Mobile Electronic Devices, in violation
 of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") ยง 291C-137.
2 On appeal,
 
Akahoshi argues that the District Court wrongly found that he
 committed the offense based on insufficient evidence. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
1/
 The Honorable Barbara T. Takase presided.
 
2/
 HRS ยง 291C-137(a) (Supp. 2013) provides that "No person shall
operate a motor vehicle while using a mobile electronic device." 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 
Akahoshi's points of error as follows, and affirm:
 
As an appellate court faced with a challenge to the 
sufficiency of the evidence to establish that a defendant committed a traffic infraction, we are obliged to consider whether, "when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, substantial evidence exists to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Agard, 113 Hawai
'i 
321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) (quoting State v. Bui, 104 Hawai
'i 462, 467, 92 P.3d 471, 476 (2004)). "'Substantial 
evidence' means credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caustion to reach a conclusion." Id. (quoting Bui, 104 Hawai
'i at 467, 92 
P.3d at 476). Here, we hold that such substantial evidence existed. 
Indeed, Officer Amacias Valdez, Jr. testified that on
 
May 22, 2014, at about 10:45 a.m., a truck drove past him. A man
 (later identified as Akahoshi) was in the driver's seat holding a
 square-shaped, light brown or black object resembling a cell
 phone to his ear. The weather was clear and there was no rain. 
Traffic was light and the roads were dry. Nothing obstructed the
 officer's view. And when Officer Valdez pulled Akahoshi over to
 the side of the roadway, Akahoshi said that someone had called
 him and he was listening to the message on the phone. 
Furthermore, the phone was attached to a lanyard around
 Akahoshi's neck. 
The District Court ruled based on its finding that 
Officer Valdez was more credible than Akahoshi. And, as discussed above, Officer Valdez's testimony constituted substantial evidence that Akahoshi committed the charged infraction. As we are obliged to defer to the trier of fact's determination of evidentiary weight and credibility, Agard, 113 Hawai
'i at 324, 151 P.3d at 805, we decline to pass upon the 
District Court's credibility determinations in this case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order, filed in the District Court of

the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Division, on August 14,
