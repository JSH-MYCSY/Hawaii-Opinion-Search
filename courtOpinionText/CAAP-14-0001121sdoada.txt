SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By:

Defendants-Appellants Roger Lee Lacuesta and Celeste
 
Kuuipo Lacuesta (the Lacuestas), appeal from the "Order Denying
 
[the Lacuestas'] Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief From Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment" (Order Denying Rule
60(b) Motion), filed on September 18, 2014, in the Circuit Court
 
of the First Circuit (circuit court).1

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On appeal, the Lacuestas contend the circuit court 
erred in denying their motion under Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)2
 because: (1) relief under HRCP Rule
60(b)(6) was appropriate given the inexcusable neglect of the
 
Lacuestas' prior attorney; (2) Plaintiff-Appellee Wells Fargo
 Bank N.A., As Trustee for the Certificateholders of Carrington
 Mortgage Loan Trust, Series 2007-FRE1 Asset-Backed Pass-Through
 Certificates (Wells Fargo) lacked standing, rendering the circuit
court's foreclosure judgment in favor of Wells Fargo void under
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4); and (3) the negligent representation of the
 Lacuestas' prior attorney amounted to a violation of the
 Lacuestas' Due Process rights.
 
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the
 Lacuestas' points of error as follows and affirm.
 
On March 19, 2014, the circuit court entered summary
 
judgment and a decree of foreclosure in favor of Wells Fargo, and
 on the same day entered an HRCP Rule 54(b) Judgment on the decree
 of foreclosure. The Lacuestas did not appeal from the Judgment. 
On June 20, 2014, after the time to appeal had run, the
 
Lacuestas filed an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion requesting relief from
 the summary judgment ruling and Judgment. The Lacuestas argued
 that the Judgment should be vacated pursuant to HRCP Rule
 60(b)(3) or (4) because the assignment of the Mortgage to Trust
 2007 FRE1 occurred six months after the trust was terminated and
 thus the assignment was void. Thus, the Lacuestas argued that
 because the trust was not the mortgagee, it did not have standing
 to foreclose on the property.

 HRCP Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:
 
On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a
final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
reasons: . . . (4) the judgment is void; . . . (6) any other
reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Lacuestas further argued that the Judgment should
 
be vacated under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) because the summary judgment
 
order in favor of Wells Fargo resulted from their prior
 attorney's inexcusable neglect of presenting frivolous and absurd
 arguments, knowing that they would fail. The Lacuestas' prior
 attorney had filed an opposition against Wells Fargo's summary
 judgment motion on the basis that the circuit court did not have
 subject matter jurisdiction because, inter alia, the Hawaiian
 Kingdom continues to exist; the circuit court was not established
 under the laws and procedures of the Hawaiian Kingdom; and by
 virtue of the circuit court maintaining proceedings without
 jurisdiction, the court was committing a violation of
 international law.

On September 18, 2014, the circuit court filed the
 
Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion. The Lacuestas timely appealed
 from the circuit court's order.
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)
 
The Lacuestas contend the circuit court erred in not
 
granting them relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) because
 summary judgment was entered against them due to the inexcusable
 neglect of their prior attorney. 
We first note that the Lacuestas did not request
 
transcripts of the hearing on their HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, and
 the transcripts are not in the record. Thus, we are unable to
 consider the arguments to the circuit court or the circuit
 court's reasoning at the hearing on the HRCP Rule 60(b) motion. 
"The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by
 reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has the
 responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." Bettencourt
 
v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) 
(citation omitted).

 Previously, the Lacuestas had filed, pro se, a motion to dismiss the
case arguing that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because
the Hawaiian Kingdom continues to exist. The Lacuestas assert they filed the
motion on the instruction of their prior attorney.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Given the record before us, we conclude the circuit 
court did not err in denying relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6). A 
motion under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) "must be based upon some reason other than those stated in clauses (1)-(5)" of HRCP Rule 60(b). Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i 144, 148, 883 P.2d 65, 69 
(1994) (citation omitted). Further, HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) "provides for extraordinary relief and is only invoked upon a showing of exceptional circumstances." Id. (citation omitted). Notably, 
"[a] party seeking relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) after the time of appeal has run must establish the existence of 'extraordinary circumstances' that prevented or rendered him unable to prosecute an appeal." Id. at 148-49, 883 P.2d at 69-70 (citation omitted). 
This court has stated:
 
Under a system where an attorney's neglect is imputed to the
client, a claim of gross negligence on the part of counsel
is in essence a claim of inexcusable neglect and thus
fundamentally distinct from a claim of excusable neglect
within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(1). "[W]hen an attorney's
neglect is gross and inexcusable courts have held that
relief may be justified under Rule 60(b)(6)."
 
U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n. v. Salvacion, No. 30594, 2011 WL 1574585,
 
at *7 (Haw. App. Apr. 26, 2011)(mem. op.) (citations omitted);
 see also City & Cty. of Honolulu v. Bennett, 2 Haw. App. 180,
 183-84, 627 P.2d 1136, 1139 (1981) (holding that the alleged
 failure of an attorney to introduce exhibits that the client
 deemed essential to the case did not constitute extraordinary
 circumstances warranting relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)).
 
The Lacuestas point to Boughner v. Secretary of Health,
 
Education and Welfare, 572 F.2d 976 (3rd Cir. 1978) to support
 their contention that relief from the Judgment pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 60(b)(6) is appropriate. In Boughner, the U.S. Circuit
 Court for the Third Circuit found that the attorney in that case
 failed to respond to fifty-two separate summary judgment motions. 
Id. at 977. The Third Circuit determined that "[t]his egregious
 conduct amounted to nothing short of leaving his clients
 unrepresented." Id. The Third Circuit concluded that because of
 
the attorney's conduct, exceptional circumstances existed and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
relief was warranted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
 
Rule 60(b)(6). Id. at 978-79.
 
This case is distinguishable from Boughner. Unlike the
 
attorney in Boughner, the Lacuestas' prior attorney filed an
 opposition to Wells Fargo's summary judgment motion. The
 Lacuestas instead seek relief under Rule 60(b)(6) due to the
 arguments that their attorney made regarding their case, which,
 however, were similar to the arguments that the Lacuestas
 submitted pro se in their earlier motion to dismiss.
 
We further note that the Lacuestas did not file an 
appeal from the Judgment on the decree of foreclosure entered in favor of Wells Fargo, and they do not set forth any arguments in their HRCP Rule 60(b) motion or in this appeal establishing "'extraordinary circumstances' that prevented or rendered [them] unable to prosecute an appeal." Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i at 149, 883 
P.2d at 70 (citation omitted). 
The Lacuestas have not established extraordinary
 
circumstances warranting relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) and the
 circuit court did not err in denying their motion based on this
 provision. 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
 
The Lacuestas also contend the circuit court erred when
 
it denied their request for relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
 because Wells Fargo lacked standing to foreclose on the
 Lacuestas' property. The Lacuestas contend that Wells Fargo
 could not have obtained the subject note and lacked standing to
 foreclose, which rendered the circuit court's judgment void under
 HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). We do not agree.
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) provides relief when a judgment is 
void. "In the sound interest of finality, the concept of a void judgment must be narrowly restricted." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. 
Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i 128, 141, 254 P.3d 439, 452 (2011) (citations 
omitted). As multiple Hawai 'i cases have recognized, "[i]t has 
been noted that a judgment is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter or 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due
 
process of law." Id. at 139, 254 P.3d at 450 (emphasis added)
 
(quoting In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 146, 642 P.2d
 938, 941 (1982)); see also Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio
 Yokoyama Tr., 8 Haw. App. 226, 233-34, 797 P.2d 1316, 1320 (1990)
 ("[I]f a court has the general power to adjudicate the issues in
 the class of suits to which the case belongs then its interim
 orders and final judgments, whether right or wrong, are not
 subject to collateral attack, so far as jurisdiction over the
 subject matter is concerned.") (citation omitted).
 
The Lacuestas do not challenge personal jurisdiction in 
this case, and an argument that a party lacks standing is not equivalent to challenging a court's subject matter jurisdiction. See Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Akepa Props. LLC, Nos. CAAP-15­0000407, CAAP-15-0000727, 2017 WL 1401468, at *3 (Haw. App. Apr. 19, 2017). Here, the circuit court had the "general power to adjudicate" Wells Fargo's foreclosure action. Cvitanovich-Dubie, 
125 Hawai
'i at 142, 254 P.3d at 453; Bank of Am., N.A. v. Kuchta, 
21 N.E.3d 1040, 1045-47 (Ohio 2014) (discussing the differences between lack of standing and subject matter jurisdiction, and holding in a foreclosure case that the defendant was barred by res judicata from asserting an issue of standing in a Rule 60(b) motion). 
Thus, the Lacuestas were not entitled to relief from
 
the Judgment under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4).
Due Process
 
The Lacuestas contend they were denied their due 
process rights because of their prior attorney's gross negligence in representing them. They did not assert a due process argument in their HRCP Rule 60(b) motion, and instead raise it for the first time on appeal. The Lacuestas have thus waived this argument. See Cty. of Haw. v. C&J Coupe Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 
Hawai
'i 352, 373, 198 P.3d 615, 636 (2008) ("As a general rule, 
if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal[.]"); Kawamata

Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai 'i 214, 248-49, 948 
P.2d 1055, 1089-90 (1997). 
Conclusion
 
Based on the above, the "Order Denying [the Lacuestas']
 
Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief From Order Granting Plaintiff's
 
Motion for Summary Judgment," filed on September 18, 2014, in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit, is affirmed.
