 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant/Cross-
Claim Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellant Robert Quartero (Appellant Robert Quartero) has asserted from the July 28, 2014 judgment on an order confirming the sale of foreclosed property, because Appellant Robert Quartero's September 5, 2014 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Immediately upon entry, the July 28, 2014 judgment on
 
the order confirming the sale of foreclosed property was
 appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667­51(a)(2) (Supp. 2013), and, thus, the July 28, 2014 judgment on
 the order confirming the sale of foreclosed property triggered
 the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a
 notice of appeal. However, Appellant Robert Quartero did not
 file his September 5, 2014 notice of appeal within thirty days
 after entry of the July 28, 2014 judgment on the order confirming
 the sale of foreclosed property, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required. 
Therefore, Appellant Robert Quartero's September 5, 2014 notice
 of appeal is untimely. The failure to file a timely notice of
 appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the
 parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in
 the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw.
 
648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o
 court or judge or justice is authorized to change the
 jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP].");
 HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may

relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to
 
comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice
 of appeal."). Absent a timely notice of appeal, we lack
 appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14­0001124. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001124 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001124 are denied as
 moot.
