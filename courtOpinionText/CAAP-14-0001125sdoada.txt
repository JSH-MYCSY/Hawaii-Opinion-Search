 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Robinson argues that the circuit court erred
 
in permitting Plaintiff/Appellee Peak Capital Group, LLC (Peak) 
to evict her from a foreclosed property once owned by
 
Defendants/Appellees Christopher Hull Perez and Jennifer Hull
 Perez (together, Perezes). Robinson contends the circuit court
 
erred in denying her "Tenant's Motion for Return of Possessions
 
Upon the Unlawful Execution of Writ of Ejectment and for Monetary
 Sanctions" (Motion for Return of Possession) because (1) Peak
 
improperly foreclosed upon the Perezes' property; (2) Peak failed
 
to give Robinson, a tenant of the property, adequate notice to
 vacate under the federal Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act of
 
2
2009 (PTFA)  and Hawaii's Residential Landlord-Tenant Code,
Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) § 521-71 (2006 Repl.); and (3)
 
Robinson was denied due process and equal protection of law.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 Robinson's appeal is without merit.
 
(1) Robinson contends the circuit court erred in 
foreclosing on the Perezes' property. However, at no time during the circuit court proceedings did Robinson appeal the circuit court's February 15, 2011 order and judgment that granted summary judgment in Peak's favor and entered an interlocutory decree of foreclosure against the Perezes. Because the order and judgment foreclosing on the property was never appealed, Robinson cannot challenge the foreclosure in this appeal. See Beneficial Hawaii, 
Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai
'i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 359, 365 (2002) ("A 
litigant who wishes to challenge a decree of foreclosure and order of sale may--and, indeed, must--do so within the thirty day period following entry of the decree or will lose the right to appeal that portion of the foreclosure proceeding".).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Robinson challenges the circuit court's order
 
granting Peak's writ of ejectment, arguing that Peak did not give
 
her adequate notice to vacate before seeking and executing its
 writ of ejectment. Specifically, Robinson argues that she was
 
3
entitled to ninety days notice, under PTFA,  and forty-five days
4
notice, under HRS § 521-71,  before Peak could evict her from the
property.
 
The circuit court entered its order granting Peak's
 
writ of ejectment on May 8, 2013, and Robinson did not appeal the
 order.
5 In issuing the writ of ejectment, the circuit court
 
found that Peak was "entitled to immediate, exclusive possession
 of all of the [foreclosed property]." The writ of ejectment
 commanded the proper authorities to "remove forthwith [the
 Perezes], and all persons holding under or through him [sic] from
 the premises . . . including their personal belongings and
 properties, and put [Peak], or its nominee, in full possession
 thereof[.]"
 
Judgment was entered on the circuit court's order 
granting the writ of ejectment pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b). Therefore, Robinson's argument that 
Peak was required to provide notice to vacate before obtaining a 
writ of ejectment should have been raised in an appeal from the circuit court's order and judgment issuing the writ. See 
3
 Robinson contends that she was a bona fide tenant under PTFA. PTFA
 
provides that "bona fide tenants" residing in foreclosed residential real
property are entitled to at least ninety days advance notice of their
obligation to vacate the premises before they can be evicted. See PTFA §
 
702(a).
 
4
 Robinson contends that she was in a month-to-month tenancy
relationship with Peak and, therefore, entitled to forty-five days notice
under HRS § 521-71(a) and (e).

 In addition, Robinson did not appeal from the circuit court's
orders denying her motion to stay and denying her motion for reconsideration.Consequently, we do not have jurisdiction to revisit those circuit courtdecisions in this appeal. See Riethbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai' i 1, 17, 282
P.3d 543, 559 (2012) ("[W]hen a party appeals from a single order, '[the ICA]will only consider other orders which were preliminary rulings upon which thesubject Order was predicated or were a part of the series of order whichcollectively led to that Order.'") (quoting Cook v. Surety Life Ins., Co., 79Hawai'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) (emphasis omitted)).

Taylor-Rice v. State, 105 Hawai 'i 104, 111, 94 P.3d 659, 666 
(2004) ("[I]t is elementary that where a party to a suit does not 
appeal from the decree entered therein, he or she must be held to acquiesce in it.") (quoting State ex rel. Price v. Magoon, 75 Haw. 164, 188, 858 P.2d 712, 724 (1993)); see also Weinberg v. Mauch, 78 Hawai
'i 40, 46, 890 P.2d 277, 283 (1995) ("[I]t is a 
necessary inference from [HRCP] 54(b) that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and . . . entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and appealability to all.") (quoting S. Utsunomiya Enters., Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480, 495, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994)). Given that Robinson failed to appeal the circuit court's order and judgment granting Peak's writ of ejectment, she cannot challenge the appropriateness of the circuit court's ejectment order on appeal from the denial of her Motion for Return of Possessions. 
(3) Robinson contends the circuit court denied her due
 
process when it denied her Motion for Return of Possessions.
 Specifically, Robinson argues that the "the trial judge committed
 a 'materially harmful error' by unjustly denying [her] an
 opportunity to present [her] case, denying [her] constitutional
 rights to a timely notice and a hearing, by ignoring [her]
 objections and motion to cure and failing to acknowledge these
 errors."
 
"Due process encompasses the opportunity to be heard at 
a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 
80, 110 P.3d 397, 404 (2005) (quoting Kernan v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 22, 856 P.2d 1207, 1218 (1993)). The circuit court gave Robinson ample opportunity to be heard despite her failure to

properly intervene in the case,  failure to appeal from the
6
 Robinson did not formally intervene in the Peak's lawsuit against
the Perezes as required under HRCP Rule 24. Although Robinson failed to
intervene in the circuit court proceedings, the circuit court allowed Robinson
to file multiple post-judgment motions on behalf of herself and other alleged
tenants of the Perezes' foreclosed property.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court's order and judgment granting a writ of ejectment,
 
and repeated failure to properly raise her PTFA defenses.7 In
 
considering Robinson's motion to stay the execution of the writ
 of ejectment, the circuit court stated:
 
I'm inclined today to deny this motion without
prejudice, okay. . . . I guess the moving party has not
shown that they are protected or a bona fide tenant at this
point in time. But if you do have documents or you do want
to refile things, you can refile. That's why I'm saying
it's done without prejudice, okay. It can be refiled but it
 has to be done more — it has to be done properly, you have
to file the proper documents with the Court.
 
I know you are representing yourself so it's hard, but
if you represent yourself, you are bound to understand the
rules of the court, too. I mean, that's the way it works.
I can't tell you how to practice but you need to file the
proper documents with the Court. Okay? But you can refile
something. Okay?
 
Robinson's opening brief fails to point to any
 
instances where the circuit court denied her an opportunity to
 
present her case, and the record indicates that the circuit court
 gave Robinson multiple opportunities to be heard "at a meaningful
 time and in a meaningful manner." 
See KNG Corp. , 107 Hawai 'i at 
80, 110 P.3d at 404. Robinson's argument that the circuit court
 denied her due process is without merit. 
Robinson's opening brief also argues that Peak
 
committed a "direct violation of [her] Fourteenth Amendment equal
 protection rights" when it executed the writ of ejectment.
 Robinson, however, fails to argue how Peak's execution of the
 writ violated her right to equal protection. Therefore, we deem
 her argument waived. 
See Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").

 The circuit court previously denied Robinson's motion to stay
without prejudice because Robinson failed to prove that she was a bona fide
tenant thereby availing herself of PTFA's ninety day notice requirement. The
 circuit court, however, granted Robinson leave to refile her motion with the
proper documentation needed to prove her PTFA defense. Robinson then filed a
 motion for reconsideration and her Motion for Return of Possessions. Both
 motions again raised PTFA defenses without providing the circuit court with
any additional evidence upon which the court could rule that Robinson was a
bona fide tenant. The circuit court held hearings for all three post-judgment
motions.
