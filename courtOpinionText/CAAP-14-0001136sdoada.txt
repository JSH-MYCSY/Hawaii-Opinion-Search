LARRY J. ORTIZ, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 13-1-0036; CRIMINAL NO. 88-0459)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Larry J. Ortiz (Ortiz) appeals
 
from the Order Dismissing Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or
 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, filed on
 August 21, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 (Circuit Court).

On October 4, 1988, Ortiz was convicted of two counts
 
of Robbery in the First Degree, two counts of Kidnapping,
 Burglary in the First Degree, and Possession of Firearm by a
 Person Convicted of Certain Crimes. The Circuit Court granted
 the State's July 29, 1988 Motion for Extended Term of

 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Imprisonment and sentenced Ortiz to an extended term of life
 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole for each Robbery in
 
the First Degree and Kidnapping conviction, and twenty years each
 for Burglary in the First Degree and Possession of Firearm by
 Person Convicted of Certain Crimes. All of the sentences were
 imposed concurrently. 
On August 15, 1989, the supreme court affirmed Ortiz's
 
convictions after concluding that the Circuit Court did not err
 by refusing to consider his oral motion to suppress made at the
 time an officer was to take the stand, did not err by allowing
 the jury to decide whether the Kidnapping offenses were class A
 or B felonies, and did not err by not allowing Ortiz to represent
 himself. The supreme court also concluded that there was no merit
 in Ortiz's contention that a mistrial should have been declared
 because the jury observed him in prison attire during trial. 
On November 20, 2007, Ortiz filed a Petition to Vacate, 
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody (First Petition), pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). Ortiz alleged that the 
indictment failed to include aggravating circumstances and that 
his extended sentence was illegal. 
On May 2, 2008, the Circuit Court issued Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Hearing on Petition
 for Post-Conviction Relief, which denied the First Petition. 
On September 25, 2009, this court affirmed the denial
 
of the First Petition.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On December 23, 2013, Ortiz filed another Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
from Custody (Second Petition). Ortiz asserted that: (1) his 
two life sentences violate the Eighth Amendment of the United 
States Constitution because the sentences constitute cruel and unusual punishment; (2) his extended terms of imprisonment violate the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 706-662 (Supp. 1986), and the 
Hawai
'i Constitution; (3) he was convicted and sentenced for two 
robberies stemming from a single event which constitutes cruel 
and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and HRS ยง 708-840; (4) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because (a) his attorney's attempt to withdraw was denied and he wanted to obtain alternate counsel, (b) his counsel failed to object to his illegal sentences, and (c) he was not made aware that his counsel filed an appeal until twenty years later because he was not provided a copy of the document; (5) the elements of Kidnapping are repetitive and overlap the elements of Robbery, and thus, the Kidnapping convictions should be vacated because it was committed incidentally as a byproduct of the robbery offenses; (6) his right to due process and equal protection were violated because his "Attempts to present claims before the court(s) have gone unanswered, unrepresented and/or ignored"; (7) he was subjected to malicious prosecution, his right to equal protection was violated, and it was an abuse of process because after he rejected a plea offer, the State requested an illegal life

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
sentence; (8) his counsel failed to claim that his rights to a
 
speedy trial and compliance with HRPP Rule 48 were violated; (9)
 fair notice was not provided that the State would seek an
 extended sentence because the aggravating circumstances were not
 within the indictment or provided at trial, and (10) the jury
 should have been instructed that Kidnapping was an included
 offense of Robbery. 
On August 21, 2014 the Circuit Court denied the Second
 
Petition. 
On appeal, Ortiz raises the same claims as in the
 
Second Petition.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Ortiz's points of error as follows:
 
Ortiz's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal on
 
August 15, 1999. Ortiz's First Petition was denied and the
 denial was affirmed by this court on September 25, 2009. Ortiz
 failed to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances to
 justify his failure to raise the issues in the Second Petition on
 direct appeal or in the First Petition. Therefore, the issues in
 the Second Petition are waived and relief pursuant to HRPP Rule
 40 is not available. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). Even if Ortiz did not
 waive the claims in the Second Petition, they are without merit
 for the following reasons.
 
(1) "A penalty which is legal under the applicable
 
sentencing statute is generally held not to be cruel and unusual,
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
if the statute itself is constitutionally valid." State v. 
Iaukea, 56 Haw. 343, 359, 537 P.2d 724, 735 (1975). Ortiz does 
not argue that the sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole is based upon an unconstitutional statute. Ortiz was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole as an extended term for four separate convictions. In Iaukea, the supreme court ruled that a life sentence with the possibility of parole imposed as an extended term does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Hawai
'i. Id. at 358, 537 P.2d at 
734. Therefore, Ortiz's first point of error is without merit. 
(2) The requirement that a jury must determine whether 
the criteria in HRS ยง 706-662 is satisfied was not recognized until 2007, in State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai
'i 432, 168 P.3d 562 
(2007). Maugaotega does not apply retroactively to Ortiz's 
collateral attack of his extended term sentences. Loher v. 
State, 118 Hawai 'i 522, 534-38, 193 P.3d 438, 450-54 (App. 2008), 
overruled in part on other grounds in State v. Auld, 136 Hawai 'i 
244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015). Therefore, the imposition of extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to HRS ยง 706-662 in Ortiz's case, in 1988, was not improper. 
(3) Ortiz was convicted of robbing two different
 
complaining witnesses. Thus, Ortiz may be convicted of two
 counts Robbery in the First Degree, even if the crimes occurred
 during the same event. Therefore, Ortiz's two convictions for
 Robbery in the First Degree do not constitute cruel and unusual
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United
 
States Constitution, as alleged by Ortiz.
 
(4) Ortiz was represented by the same counsel at trial
 
and on direct appeal. The record indicates that his attorney
 attempted to withdraw because Ortiz demanded that he be allowed
 to represent himself at trial, not because Ortiz wanted
 alternative counsel. On direct appeal, the supreme court found
 that Ortiz's claim that the Circuit Court erred by not permitting
 Ortiz to represent himself was without merit. Ortiz's sentence
 was not illegal, and therefore, Ortiz's counsel was not
 ineffective for failing to object to an illegal sentence. Ortiz
 failed to present any facts or argument that his being unaware
 that his counsel filed a direct appeal resulted in a withdrawal
 or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. 
Therefore, Ortiz failed to satisfy his burden of establishing
 ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346,
 
348-49, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980).
 
(5) In State v. Correa, 5 Haw. App. 644, 648-49, 706
 
P.2d 1321, 1325 (1985), this court held that "a kidnapping that
 is necessarily and incidentally committed during a robbery cannot
 be the basis of a charge of kidnapping in addition to a charge of
 robbery." "Conversely, a kidnapping that was not necessarily and
 incidentally committed during a robbery may be charged as a
 separate offense in addition to the robbery charge." Id. In
 
Correa, this court affirmed a defendant's convictions for both
 kidnapping and robbery because there was substantial evidence
 that a kidnapping extended beyond the acts of kidnapping that
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
necessarily and incidentally were committed during robberies when
 
a defendant locked several victims in a store bathroom while also
 taking jewelry and cash and demanding money from a customer. Id.
 
at 645, 648-49, 706 P.2d at 1322, 1325. In his Second Petition
 and on appeal, Ortiz claims that the elements of Kidnapping are
 repetitive and overlap Robbery and that the kidnapping was
 incidental to the robbery offenses. However, Ortiz fails to
 state any facts to support his claim. Therefore, the claim is
 without merit. 
(6) The supreme court decided Ortiz's direct appeal on
 
August 15, 1989. On May 2, 2008, the Circuit Court issued
 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Hearing
 on Petition for Post-Conviction Relief which denied Ortiz's First
 Petition. On September 25, 2009, this court affirmed the denial
 of the First Petition. On August 21, 2014, the Circuit Court
 denied the Second Petition. Thus, Ortiz's claim that his
 attempts at presenting his claims have gone unanswered by various
 courts is without merit. 
(7) Due process requires that the State abide by the 
terms of a plea agreement. State v. Miller, 122 Hawai
'i 92, 100, 
223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010). However, absent a binding plea agreement, the State is not barred from requesting an extended sentence pursuant to HRS ยง 706-661 (1985). Therefore, Ortiz's claim that his equal protection rights were violated, or that his prosecution was malicious and an abuse of process, because the State sought an extended sentence, is without merit.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(8) Ortiz was indicted on March 23, 1988, for the 
crimes upon which he was convicted. Ortiz was arrested on March 
24, 1988. Ortiz's trial commenced on July 5, 1988. Ortiz's trial commenced within six months from the date of his arrest or indictment. Therefore, HRPP Rule 48 was not violated. "Whether the Government has violated an accused's right to a speedy trial is determined by applying the four-part test articulated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, [92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101] (1972)[.]" State v. Lau, 78 Hawai
'i 54, 62, 890 P.2d 291, 299 
(1995). "The four factors to be considered in determining whether dismissal is warranted are: (1) length of the delay; (2) reasons for the delay; (3) defendant's assertion of his right to speedy trial; and (4) prejudice to the defendant." Id. A delay 
in trial of at least six months is sufficient to warrant inquiry into the other factors. Id. at 63, 890 P.2d at 300. However, in 
this case, the delay in trial did not exceed six months. Thus, inquiry into the other factors was not warranted. Even if Ortiz's counsel failed to claim that his right to a speedy trial was violated, it does not appear that the failure to assert such a claim resulted in the loss or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. Antone, 62 Haw. at 348-49, 615 
P.2d at 104. 
(9) As stated above, the requirement that a jury
 
determine whether the criteria in HRS ยง 706-662 are satisfied is
 not retroactive and thus, does not apply to Ortiz. Ortiz's claim
 that notice must be provided in the charging instrument that the
 State is seeking extended term sentencing was previously ruled
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
upon in his First Petition. Therefore, relief is not available. 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(3). In addition, in State v. Jess, 117 Hawai 'i 
381, 396-400, 184 P.3d 133, 148-152 (2008), the court announced a new rule that when the State seeks to impose an extended term of imprisonment it must be included in the charging instrument. However, the court in Jess also held the rule was only prospective. Id. at 400-04, 184 P.3d at 152-56. Thus, Jess does 
not apply to Ortiz's case. 
(10) "Pursuant to HRS ยง 701-109(4)(a) an uncharged 
offense is included within a charged offense if the former "is established by proof of the same or less than all of the facts required to establish the commission" of the latter. Put differently, the uncharged offense is an "included" offense under HRS ยง 701-109(4)(a) if it is impossible to commit the charged offense without also committing the uncharged offense." State v. 
Kinnane, 79 Hawai
'i 46, 55, 897 P.2d 973, 982 (1995) (citing 
State v. Alston, 75 Hawai 'i 517, 533, 865 P.2d 157, 166 (1994)). 
Kidnapping is not an included offense of Robbery in the First Degree because a person may be convicted of Robbery in the First Degree without necessarily committing Kidnapping. Therefore, Ortiz was not entitled to a jury instruction that Kidnapping is an included offense of Robbery in the First Degree.
