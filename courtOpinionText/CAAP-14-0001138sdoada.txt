(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
This consolidated appeal1/ arises out of an
 
1/ In appeal No. CAAP-14-0001138, Szymanski appeals from (a) the
August 27, 2014 Order Denying Defendant and Third Party Plaintiff Michael J.
Szymanski's Motion to Vacate Judge Rhonda Loo's 2004 Rulings and All

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
interpleader action in which Plaintiff-Appellee Title Guaranty 
Escrow Services, Inc., an escrow company, interpled Defendant/Cross Claimant/Cross Claim Defendant/Third-party Plaintiff/Third-party Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant Michael J. Szymanski and Defendant/Cross-claim Defendant/Cross Claimant-Appellee Wailea Resort Company, Ltd., a Hawai' i corporation, and 
Third-party Defendants/Cross-claim Defendants/Third-party Counterclaimants-Appellees ADOA-Shinwa Development Corporation, a Hawai'i corporation, Shinwa Golf Hawai' i Co., Ltd., a Hawai' i 
corporation, the parties to a land sale contract, after that contract had been breached. Wailea, the seller, and Szymanski, the buyer, each claimed that the other breached the contract.
2/ 
The case was filed and litigated in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit ("Circuit Court").
3/ This consolidated appeal is 
the fourth in a series of appeals related to the underlying land sales contract filed by Syzmanski. 
On March 20, 2003, the Circuit Court entered judgment, 
certified under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 
54(b), in favor of Title Guaranty and against Szymanski and Wailea as to Title Guaranty's complaint for interpleader. No appeal was taken from the March 20, 2003 certified judgment. 
Thereafter, the Circuit Court issued various orders, 
some while matters were on appeal to this court. Prior to these consolidated appeals, Syzmanski appealed on three occasions. See 
Title Guar. Escrow Serv., Inc. v. Szymanski, No. 27254, 2009 WL 1112604, *3 (Hawai' i App. April 27, 2009) (hereinafter, "Appeal 
1") (affirming the April 20, 2005 certified judgment concerning 
1/(...continued)
Ltd's and Third-Party Defendants ADOA-Shinwa Development Corporation's and
Shinwa Golf Hawaii Co., Ltd.'s Motion for Entry of Final Judgment After
Dismissal of Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction Filed on September 25, 2015
("2015 Order Granting Final Judgment").
 
The cases were consolidated on appeal by an Order of Consolidation
dated October 13, 2017. 
2/ In his third-party complaint, Szymanski named Shinwa Golf Hawai 'i 
as the defendant, alleging that Shinwa tortiously interfered with his contractwith Wailea, and his prospective business relationship with Wailea, thuscausing Wailea to breach the contract. 
3/ At all times relevant to this appeal, though not at all times in
the history of this case, the Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided.

Szymanski's claims against Wailea); Title Guar. Escrow Serv., 
Inc. v. Szymanski, No. 30697, 2013 WL 5761945, at *4 (Hawai' i 
App. Oct. 24, 2013) (hereinafter, "Appeal 2") (vacating and remanding the July 28, 2010 final judgment with respect to the dispersal of funds to Wailea); Title Guar. Escrow Serv., Inc. v. Szymanski, No. CAAP-12-0000711, 2016 WL 4555771, at *7 (Hawai' i 
App. Aug. 31, 2016), cert. denied, No. SCWC-12-0000711, 2017 WL 127710 (Jan. 12, 2017) [hereinafter, "Appeal 3"] (holding that Judge Rhonda Loo's recusal was not required and affirming the Circuit Court's orders denying Appellant's motions under HRCP Rule 60(b) and Rule 59(e)). 
Szymanski raises four points of error in this
 
consolidated appeal: (1) that Judge Loo should have recused
 herself from the case; (2) that the Circuit Court erred in
 granting final judgment in favor of Wailea; (3) that the Circuit
 Court erred in granting Wailea's motion to disburse funds to
 Wailea; and (4) that the Circuit Court erred in denying his
 motion for leave to take preservation depositions pending appeal
 ("Order Denying Motion for Depositions").
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Szymanski's points of
 error as follows and affirm.
 
(1) In his first point of error, Szymanski argues that
 
Judge Loo should have recused herself because she had a conflict
 of interest, specifically that she had an interest in the company
 that subsequently purchased the land at issue. 
We have previously reviewed this issue in Appeal 3,
 
where we concluded that "Judge Loo's ownership of stock in
 [Alexander & Baldwin] was de minimis in the context of this case
 because Judge Loo's stock ownership was too remote of a financial
 interest to require disqualification." Appeal 3, 2016 WL 4555771
 
at *6.
4/ In arriving at that conclusion, we performed the two-
part analysis for disqualification or recusal cases provided for

 Certiorari was denied in Title Guarantee v. Wailea , No. SCWC-12­
0000711, 2017 WL 127710 (Jan. 12, 2017)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
in State v. Ross, 89 Hawai' i 371, 377, 974 P.2d 11, 17 (1998) and 
concluded that Judge Loo's interest in a subsequent purchaser who 
was a non-party did not objectively give rise to the appearance of impropriety. Appeal 3, 2016 WL 4555771 at *6. Specifically, 
we rejected Szymanski's contention that Liljeberg v. Health Servs . Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847 (1988) required recusal because, we said, Liljeberg was factually distinguishable in that "there was a direct and documented benefit to the judge[.]" Appeal 3, 2016 WL 4555771 at *6. 
The doctrine of the law of the case states that a
 
determination of a question of law made by an appellate
court in the course of an action becomes the law of the case
 and may not be disputed by a reopening of the question at a
later stage of the litigation. This doctrine applies to
issues that have been decided either expressly or by
necessary implication.
 
Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g & Erection, Inc., 87 Haw. 37, 48–49,
 
951 P.2d 487, 498–99 (1998). Szymanski's argument in this case
 rests on the same ground that it did in Appeal 3.  Accordingly,
 under the law of the case doctrine, we are barred from re­examining an identical claim in this appeal.
 
(2) Likewise, Szymanski argues in his second point of
 
error that Judge Cahill erred in entering final judgment where
 the third-party complaint against Shinwa had not been resolved.
 However, Judge Shackley F. Raffetto entered his Final Judgment as
 to All Claims and All Parties on July 28, 2010, in which he
 dismissed with prejudice "all claims asserted by Defendant
 Michael Szymanski in his Third-Party Complaint against [Shinwa]."
 This order was the subject of Appeal 2, which affirmed the
 entirety of the order,
5/ with the exception of vacating and
 
remanding on the disbursement issue. Appeal 2, 2013 WL 5761945,
 
at *4. Therefore, this court has already reviewed the dismissal
 of Szymanski's third-party complaint against Shinwa and affirmed
 it.
 
In this appeal, No. CAAP-16-0000034, Szymanski
 
challenges a separate order, the 2015 Order Granting Final
 Judgment, but does so on the same allegation, that his third-
party cross-claim remains active. On that basis, review of the
 
5/ Szymanski did not seek certiorari from our decision in Appeal 2 .
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
argument is likewise barred, for the reasons stated above. 
(3) In his third point of error, Szymanski alleges that
 
the Circuit Court erred when it granted Wailea's motion for the
 
disbursal of funds. This court has already affirmed the orders
 that were the subject of Appeal 1, finding that Szymanski
 breached the contract. Appeal 1, 2009 WL 1112604 at *2-3. 
Szymanski argues that the funds were not a "down payment" and
 accordingly, they were not non-refundable even in the event of
 his breach. The record, however, does not support this argument. 
The contract provides, in relevant part:
 
Events of Default. The following shall constitute
"Events of Default" under this Contract:
 
(a) Buyer or any person or entity succeeding to
Buyer's interest under or obligated to perform Buyer's
obligations under this Contract, shall fail to observe or
perform any term, provision or obligation to be observed or
performed under this Contract[.]
 
The Seller's Remedies section indicates that
 
[u]pon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Seller shall
have the following rights and remedies: 
(a) If such Event of Default should occur prior to the
date the Deed is filed in the Office of the Assistant
 Registrar, Seller's sole remedy shall be to cancel this
Contract, whereupon all rights of Buyer and duties and
obligations of Seller shall terminate, and Seller shall be
 
entitled to retain all of the Downpayments as Seller's sole
and absolute property as compensation for Seller's costs in
negotiating and preparing this Contract and for the damage
caused by the default , Buyer hereby agreeing that the
Downpayments represent fair and reasonable compensation to
Seller for the default[.]
 
The Initial Downpayment section of the contract indicates that
 
"One hundred percent (100%) of the Initial Downpayment
 ([$40,000]) shall not be refundable . . . ."
 
The Fourth Amendment to Land Sales Contract (SF-S)
 
document alters the Initial Downpayment section to make the
 entire downpayment refundable, if closing does not occur by
 June 30, 2000, and requires an additional downpayment of $40,000,
 also refundable if closing does not occur by April 28, 2000. The
 amendment ends by stating that "[a]ll other terms and provisions
 of the Contract shall remain in full force and effect and are
 unchanged by this Fourth Amendment."
 
While Szymanski correctly contends that the amendments
 
to the contract make the downpayments refundable in the event the
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
transaction does not close, they expressly make the deposits non­
refundable in an Event of Default. Giving the plain meaning to
 the terms of the contract, Szymanski could have been refunded his
 downpayments up to the point of default. However, this court has
 already affirmed a finding that Szymanski breached the contract. 
As a legal matter, an Event of Default has been established. 
Accordingly, Wailea was clearly entitled to retain the
 downpayments as compensation for costs and damages. 
Consequently, the Circuit Court did not err in granting Wailea's
 motion for disbursal of the funds. 
(4) In his final point of error, Szymanski argues that 
the Circuit Court erred in its Order Denying Motion for Depositions. Syzmanski had sought permission under HRCP Rule 27 to take certain belated depositions, but the Circuit Court denied his request on the basis that he should have included those depositions earlier in his request for depositions under HRCP Rule 26. "[T]he extent to which discovery is permitted under Rule 26 is subject to considerable latitude and the discretion of the trial court." Hac v. Univ. of Hawai' i, 102 Hawai' i 92, 100­
01, 73 P.3d 46, 54-55 (2003) (emphasis added; original brackets and ellipsis omitted) (quoting Wakabayashi v. Hertz Corp., 66 
Haw. 265, 275, 660 P.2d 1309, 1315 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Given the dearth of caselaw regarding HRCP Rule 27 in 
Hawai'i, we look to the corresponding federal rule for guidance. 
"Rule 27 is not a substitute for discovery. It is available in special circumstances to preserve testimony which could otherwise be lost. In addition, the text of the Rule makes it clear that reversal is warranted only when the trial judge has committed an abuse of discretion." Ash v. Cort, 512 F.2d 909, 912 (3d Cir. 
1975) (emphasis added). 
In denying Szymanski's motion, the Circuit Court cited
 
the age of the case and the ample opportunity that Szymanski had
 to perfect his discovery. Szymanski fails to provide sufficient
 argument to establish that these bases were erroneous or
 reflected an abuse of discretion, instead focusing his argument
 on the lack of prejudice to Wailea. Further, Szymanski concedes
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
in his briefs that the depositions are only relevant if Judge 
Loo's rulings are vacated, to prepare for the eventual retrial in that circumstance.
6/ As the issue of Judge Loo's rulings has 
been addressed in previous appeals, and we decline to reexamine the issue in the instant appeals, even if the motion was erroneously denied, it was harmless. See Bank of Hawaii v. 
Shinn, 120 Hawai' i 1, 9, 200 P.3d 370, 378 (2008) (finding error 
which did not affect the outcome of the case to be harmless); see also Wakabayashi, 66 Haw. at 272, 660 P.2d at 1314 (finding that excluding evidence which would not have changed the outcome was error, but that the error was harmless.) 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court of the Second
 
Circuit's August 27, 2014 Order Denying Defendant and Third Party
 Plaintiff Michael J. Szymanski's Motion to Vacate Judge Rhonda
 Loo's 2004 Rulings and All Subsequent Rulings Based Upon Them,
 Due to Her Failure To Recuse Herself, filed on June 30, 2014; the
 November 24, 2014 Final Judgment as to All Claims and Parties;
 and the December 23, 2015 Order Granting Defendant Wailea Resort
 Company, Ltd's and Third-Party Defendants ADOA-Shinwa Development
 Corporation's and Shinwa Golf Hawaii Co., Ltd.'s Motion for Entry
 of Final Judgment After Dismissal of Appeal for Lack of
 Jurisdiction Filed on September 25, 2015 are affirmed.
