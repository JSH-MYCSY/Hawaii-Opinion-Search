Hart (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;

(3) Appellant obtained three extensions of time for the
 
opening brief before she defaulted;
 
(4) On April 22, 2015, the court granted Appellant
 
relief from default and a fourth extension of time for the
 
opening brief to May 7, 2015. The court ordered that no further
 extensions shall be granted, and cautioned Appellant that failure
 to timely file the opening brief may result in sanctions,
 including dismissal of the appeal;
 
(5) Appellant failed to file the opening brief;
 
(6) On May 18, 2015, the appellate clerk informed 
Appellant that the time for filing the opening brief had expired and, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 30, 
the matter would be called to the court’s attention on May 28, 2015, for such action as the court deems proper, which could include dismissal; and 
(7) Thereafter, Appellant did not file the opening
 
brief, or respond to the default notice. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
 
dismissed.
