IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ANDREA FELIX, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)

(CASE NO. 1DCW-13-0003321)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Andrea Felix (Felix) was originally
 
charged with harassment by stalking, but the complaint was
 
subsequently amended to charge harassment. The District Court of
 
1
the First Circuit (District Court)  dismissed the harassment
charge for violation of the speedy trial time limits set forth in Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48(b) (2000), and it 
ordered that the dismissal be "without prejudice." Felix appeals from the "Order Granting [Felix's] Motion to Dismiss for Violation of HRPP Rule 48" (Order) that was filed by the District Court on September 8, 2014. 
1The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided over the proceedings
relevant to this appeal.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Felix contends that the District Court erred 
in dismissing the harassment charge without prejudice, instead of 
with prejudice. We apply State v. Hern, 133 Hawai 'i 59, 323 P.3d 
1241 (App. 2013), in deciding Felix's appeal. 
In Hern, this court held that "in determining whether
 
to dismiss a charge with or without prejudice under HRPP Rule
 48(b), the trial court must not only consider the Estencion
 factors,[ 
2
] but must also clearly articulate the effect of the
Estencion factors and any other factor it considered in rendering its decision." Hern
, 133 Hawai 'i at 64, 323 P.3d at 1246. Here, 
the District Court did not comply with these requirements, and we conclude that the record is not sufficient for this court to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing the charge without prejudice. 
Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's Order, and
 
we remand the case with instructions that the District Court: (1)
 consider the Estencion factors in determining whether to dismiss
 Felix's harassment charge with or without prejudice; and (2) make
 findings that clearly articulate the effect of the Estencion
 factors and any other factor it considered in rendering its
 decision.

2The "Estencion factors" are: "'[(1)] the seriousness of the offense;
[(2)] the facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;
and [(3)] the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of [HRPP Rule48] and on the administration of justice.'" State v. Hern, 133 Hawai' i 59,
60, 323 P.3d 1241, 1242 (App. 2013) (brackets in original) (quoting State v.Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981)).
