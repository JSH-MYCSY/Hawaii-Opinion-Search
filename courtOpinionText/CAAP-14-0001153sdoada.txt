STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
KEOHOKUI A. KAUIHANA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 5DTI-14-000573)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Keohokui Arnold Kauihana (Kauihana)
 
appeals from the Judgment entered against him on the following
 
traffic infractions: (1) delinquent vehicle tax; (2) fraudulent
 use of vehicle plates, tags, or emblems (two counts); (3) failure
 to keep certificate of registration in vehicle; and (4) failure
 to possess valid driver's license and insurance identification
 card (two counts). The Judgment was entered by the District
 
1
Court of the Fifth Circuit (District Court)  on September 5,
2014.

 
On appeal, Kauihana seeks to overturn the District 
Court's Judgment based on his argument that the State of Hawai 'i 
and the District Court lacked jurisdiction over him because he is under the jurisdiction of the Hawaiian Kingdom. We conclude that

Kauihana's argument is without merit. See State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai'i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) ("Individuals claiming 
to be citizens of the Kingdom [of Hawai 'i] and not of the State 
[of Hawai 'i] are not exempt from application of the State's 
laws."); State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 
664 (App. 2004) ("[T]he State of Hawai 'i has lawful jurisdiction 
over all persons operating motor vehicles on public roads or 
highways within the State of Hawai 'i. Persons claiming to be 
citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai 'i and not of the State of Hawai 'i 
are not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai 'i applicable 
to all persons (citizens and non-citizens) operating motor vehicles on public roads and highways within the State of Hawai
'i."), aff'd, 106 Hawai 'i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). 
Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's Judgment.
