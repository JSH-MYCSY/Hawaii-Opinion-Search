IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
TODD PERKINS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TAMMY ASH PERKINS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 11-1-0086)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Tammy Ash
 
Perkins's (Appellant Tammy Perkins) appeal in appellate court
 case number CAAP-14-0001158 from the Honorable Keith E. Tanaka's
 October 1, 2014 post-judgment order on Plaintiff-Appellee Todd
 Atherton Perkins's (Appellee Todd Perkins) September 8, 2014
 motion for post-decree relief regarding various visitation issues
 relating to the terms of a September 26, 2012 divorce decree,
 because the October 1, 2014 post-judgment order did not finally
 determine all of the issues in Appellee Todd Perkins's
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief, and, thus, the 
October 1, 2014 post-judgment order does not qualify as an appealable final post-judgment order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006). 
"An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree
 
of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for
 review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and
 conditions as in other cases in the circuit court[.]" 
HRS § 571­
54. In circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may appeal from 
"final judgments, orders or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014). In light of the family court's prior entry of the September 26, 2012 divorce decree in this case, the instant case involves a post-judgment proceeding. "A post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order finally determines the post-judgment proceeding." Hall v. Hall, 
96 Hawai
'i 105, 111 n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 2001) 
(citation omitted), affirmed in part, and vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai
'i 318, 22 P.3d 965 (2001). 
In other words, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 
103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
"Correlatively, an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Id. (citation omitted). 
In the instant case, the family court utilized the
 
October 1, 2014 post-judgment order to adjudicate some, but not
 all, of the issues in the post-judgment proceeding for Appellee
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Todd Perkins's September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief. 
In paragraphs 5 and 6 on page 4 of the October 1, 2014 post-
judgment order, the family court expressly directs the parties to
 participate in mediation regarding certain remaining issues, and
 the family court initially schedules a future return hearing for
 November 19, 2014, at which time the parties are to report the
 results of the mediation to the family court. Through subsequent
 orders that the family court entered on November 25, and November
 26, 2014, the family court ultimately rescheduled the hearing
 regarding the mediation for March 30, 2015. The October 1, 2014
 post-judgment order would become eligible for appellate review by
 way of a timely appeal from the family court's future post-
judgment order that finally determines the remaining issues and
 ends this post-judgment proceeding, based on the principle that,
 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.
 
S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw.
 
480, 494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal
 quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted). When the family
 court enters a final post-judgment order that finally determines
 the remaining issues of Appellee Todd Perkins's September 8, 2014
 motion for post-decree relief, then a timely appeal from that
 post-judgment order would entitle an aggrieved party to assert a
 timely appeal for the review of the entire series of post-
judgment orders in this post-judgment proceeding under the
 principle that "this court will only consider other orders which
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
were preliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was 
predicated or were part of the series of orders which collectively led to that Order." Cook v. Surety Life Insurance 
Company, 79 Hawai
'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) 
(citations omitted); see also Riethbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai 'i 1, 
17, 282 P.3d 543, 560 (2012). 
The record on appeal does not contain a post-judgment
 
order that finally determines the remaining issues of Appellee
 Todd Perkins's September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief. 
Absent an appealable post-judgment order, Appellant Tammy
 Perkins's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001158
 is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0001158 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
