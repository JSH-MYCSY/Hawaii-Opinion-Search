NO. CAAP-14-0001163
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ANTHONY MICHAEL MIYOSE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 13-1-1035)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Anthony Michael Miyose (Miyose)
 
appeals from a September 23, 2014 "Judgment of Conviction and
 
Probation Sentence" (Judgment) entered by the Circuit Court of
 
1
the First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Miyose contends that Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai 'i (State) failed to produce sufficient evidence to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Miyose acted either as a principal or as an accomplice to the offense of assault in the second degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 707-711(1)(d) (2014 Repl.). The State argued at trial that 
Miyose should be found guilty as an accomplice. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Miyose's
 appeal is without merit.
 
"[I]n reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to

support the conviction the appellate court must take that view of 
the evidence with inferences reasonably and justifiably to be drawn therefrom most favorable to the Government, without weighing the evidence or determining the credibility of the witnesses." State v. Cannon, 56 Haw. 161, 166, 532 P.2d 391, 396 
(1975) (citation and internal quotations omitted). "The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 
248, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992). "'Substantial evidence' as to every material element of the offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value as to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 
61 (1996) (quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai 'i 262, 265, 892 
P.2d455, 458 (1995). Under such a review, the appellate court gives "full play to the right of the fact finder to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact." State v. Yabusaki, 58 Haw. 404, 411, 570 P.2d 844, 848 
(1977). 
HRS ยง 707-711(1)(d) provides, that "[a] person commits
 
the offense of assault in the second degree if . . . [t]he person
 intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a
 dangerous instrument[.]" In addition, HRS ยง 702-221(2)(c) (2014
 Repl.) provides, that "[a] person is legally accountable for the
 conduct of another person when . . . [h]e is an accomplice of
 such other person in the commission of the offense." 
Furthermore, HRS ยง 702-222(1)(b) (2014 Repl.) provides, in
 pertinent part, that "[a] person is an accomplice of another
 person in the commission of an offense if . . . [w]ith the
 intention of promoting or facilitating the commission of the
 offense, the person . . . [a]ids or agrees or attempts to aid the
 other person in planning or committing it[.]"
 
The record indicates was substantial evidence that
 
Miyose was an accomplice to another person with the intention of
 promoting or facilitating the commission of assault in the second
 degree. The record also indicates there was substantial evidence

that Miyose participated with other persons intentionally or
 
knowingly causing the bodily injury to another with a dangerous
 instrument, a baseball bat.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence" entered September 23, 2014 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
