(3) On November 5, 2014, Appellant filed an untimely
 
motion for reconsideration of the October 21, 2014 order denying
 
the motion to proceed IFP. The court denied the November 5, 2014
 motion. 
(4) On December 5, 2014, Appellant filed an
 
unauthorized second motion for reconsideration of the October 21,
 2014 order denying the motion to proceed IFP. The court denied
 the December 5, 2014 motion. 
(5) On December 12, 2014, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the deadline to file the record on appeal expired
 on December 8, 2014; Appellant had not paid the filing and
 docketing fees; the court had denied Appellant's motion to
 proceed IFP; the record on appeal could not be prepared and filed
 without full payment of all fees; the court would be notified of
 the matter on December 22, 2014, for such action as the court
 deemed proper, which may include dismissal of the appeal; and
 Appellant may request relief from default of the record on appeal
 by motion.
 
(6) Thereafter, Appellant took no further action in
 
this appeal. 
	Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 12, 2015.
