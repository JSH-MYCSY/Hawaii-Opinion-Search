APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-2936)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants appeal from a September 19, 2014
 
"Order Striking Plaintiff's First Amended Verified Complaint For
 
Temporary Restraining Orders, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
 and Damages, Filed 9/15/14," entered in the Circuit Court of the
 
1
 First Circuit (circuit court).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 appeal is without merit.
 
Final Judgment was entered in this case on May 19,
 
2014. Plaintiffs-Appellants filed a "First Amended Verified

 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Complaint For Temporary Restraining Orders, Declaratory and
 
Injunctive Relief and Damages; Demand For Jury Trial" on
 September 15, 2014, which was struck by the circuit court on
 September 19, 2014 because a final judgment dismissing the case
 had been filed four months earlier.
 
Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 15 does not 
authorize the amendment of a complaint after final judgment in a case has been entered. See Jarvis v. Regan, 833 F.2d 149, 155 
(9
th
 Cir. 1987) ("Where a final judgment is entered following
dismissal of an action, the plaintiff no longer has a right to
 amend the complaint as a matter of course.").
 
Therefore,

 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the September 19, 2014 "Order
 
Striking Plaintiff's First Amended Verified Complaint For
 Temporary Restraining Orders, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
 and Damages, Filed 9/15/14," entered in the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
