IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DAN MEZURASHI, Defendant-Appellee, and
EXODUS BAIL BOND, Real Party-In-Interest Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 07-1-0336)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Real-Party-in-Interest/Appellant Exodus Bail Bond
 
(Exodus) appeals from the Order Denying Motion to Reconsider
 
Denial of Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture (Order Denying
Reconsideration), which was entered on September 17, 2014, in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, Exodus asserts that: (1) the Circuit Court 
erred when it allowed the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney 
(Prosecutor) to represent the State of Hawai 'i (State) in a bail 
forfeiture proceeding; (2) the Circuit Court erred when it allowed the Prosecutor to enforce the Circuit Court's August 6, 2007 Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond (Forfeiture 
Judgment); (3) the Forfeiture Judgment is void; and (4) the 
Circuit Court gravely erred in summarily denying reconsideration.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we conclude that Exodus's arguments are without merit. This court has previously considered and rejected Exodus's contention that the Prosecutor is not authorized to represent the State in bail forfeiture proceedings. See State v. Miles, 135 Hawai
'i 525, __ 
P.3d __, (App. 2015); State v. Allen, No. 14-0000838 (App. June 24, 2015). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's September 17, 2014
 
Order Denying Reconsideration is affirmed.
