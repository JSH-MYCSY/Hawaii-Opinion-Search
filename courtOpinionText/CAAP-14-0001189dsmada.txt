 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ORDER GRANTING NOVEMBER 13, 2014 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Third-Party Defendants/Appellees 
Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. (Appellee Beneficial Hawaii), and HSBC 
Finance Corp.'s (Appellee HSBC Finance) November 13, 2014 motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001189 for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Defendants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/ Third-Party Plaintiffs/Appellants Ian Keith Thomas and Jenies Oak Rodney Thomas's (the Thomas Appellants) November 20, 2014 memorandum in opposition to Appellees Beneficial Hawaii and HSBC Finance's November 13, 2014 motion to dismiss, and (3) the record, it appears that we do not have appellate jurisdiction over the Thomas Appellants' appeal from the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe's May 21, 2014 judgment because the Thomas Appellants' October 17, 2014 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(3) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) as to the May 
21, 2014 judgment and the August 22, 2014 post-judgment order granting Appellees Beneficial Hawaii and HSBC Finance's June 4, 2014 motion for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Rule 54(d)(2)(B) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
Under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 &
 
Supp. 2013), "[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from
 all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . .
 courts[.]" Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the
 manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). 
HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth
 on a separate document." Based on this requirement under
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has held that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims 
against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (emphasis added). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, "an 
appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d 
at 1338. 
Although the May 21, 2014 judgment does not resolve all
 
claims against all parties, the May 21, 2014 contains an express
 finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as
 to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to
 HRCP Rule 54(b). Therefore, the May 21, 2014 judgment is an
 appealable final judgment pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP
 Rule 54(b), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins.
 
Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), Appellees Beneficial
 
Hawaii and HSBC Finance extended the initial thirty-day time
 period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal by
 filing their June 4, 2014 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) motion for
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
attorneys' fees and costs within fourteen days after entry of the 
May 21, 2014 judgment, as HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) required to timely invoke the tolling provision in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) "provides that the court has 90 days to dispose of [the] post-judgment [tolling] motion . . . , regardless of when the notice of appeal is filed." Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai
'i 
202, 221, 159 P.3d 814, 833 (2007). When "the court fail[s] to issue an order on [the movant]'s [post-judgment tolling] motion by . . . ninety days after [the movant has] filed the [post­judgment tolling] motion, the [post-judgment tolling] motion [i]s deemed denied." County of Hawai
'i v. C&J Coupe Family Limited 
Partnership, 119 Hawai 'i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 (2008). 
Nevertheless, "when a timely post-judgment tolling motion is deemed denied, it does not trigger the thirty-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal until entry of the judgment or appealable order pursuant to HRAP Rules 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(3)." Association of Condominium Homeowners of Tropics at Waikele v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai
'i 254, 256, 318 P.3d 94, 96 (2013). 
Consequently, "the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an order disposing of the motion[.]" HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (emphasis added). 
In the instant case, the circuit court triggered the
 
extended thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) for any
 party to file a notice of appeal by entering the August 22, 2014
 post-judgment order granting Appellees Beneficial Hawaii and HSBC
 Finance's June 4, 2014 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) post-judgment motion
 for an award of attorneys' fees and costs. Once the circuit
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court entered the August 22, 2014 post-judgment order awarding 
attorneys' fees and costs, there was no need for the circuit court to subsequently enter the September 18, 2014 judgment on the same award of attorneys' fees and costs to render the August 
22, 2014 order appealable, because 
the rule in Jenkins[ v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright] - to
wit, that circuit court orders resolving claims against the
parties must generally be reduced to a judgment and the
judgment must be entered in favor of or against the
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 58 before an
appeal may be taken - is limited to circuit court orders
disposing of claims raised in a circuit court complaint.
 
Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai 'i 153, 159, 80 P.3d 974, 980 (2003) 
(emphases in original text). Unlike circuit court orders 
disposing of claims raised in a circuit court complaint, a "circuit court’s order awarding attorneys' fees and costs may not be certified as a final judgment, . . . because such an order is not a final decision with respect to a claim for relief." Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai
'i 116, 136 n.16, 19 P.3d 699, 719 n.16 
(2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "The entry of judgment and taxation of costs are separate legal acts." CRSC, Inc. v. Sage Diamond Co., Inc., 95 Hawai
'i 301, 307, 22 
P.3d 97, 103 (App. 2001) (citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). In fact, HRCP Rule 58 specifically provides that "[t]he entry of the judgment shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs." Consequently, although a separate judgment is usually necessary for an appeal from dispositive rulings on substantive claims under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins, "the separate judgment requirement articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment context." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai
'i at 158, 80 P.3d at 979; Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i at 254, 195 P.3d at 1186 (citing Ditto v. McCurdy and 
acknowledging that "certain exceptions to this rule [in Jenkins] 
have been recognized, specifically, with regard to post-judgment orders[.]"). For example, a post-judgment order, by itself, which finally determines a post-judgment motion for attorneys' "fees and interest is an appealable final [post-judgment] order under HRS § 641-1(a)." Chun v. Board of Trustees, 106 Hawai
'i 
416, 429 n.12, 106 P.3d 339, 352 n.12 (2005). Once a circuit court has entered an appealable post-judgment order, any subsequent judgment on the same appealable post-judgment order is "superfluous[.]" Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i at 160, 80 P.3d 
at 981. 
In the instant case, after the circuit court entered
 
the August 22, 2014 post-judgment order granting Appellees
 Beneficial Hawaii and HSBC Finance's June 4, 2014 HRCP
 Rule 54(d)(2)(B) post-judgment motion for an award of attorneys'
 fees and costs, the circuit court's subsequent entry of the
 September 18, 2014 judgment on the same award of attorneys' fees
 and costs was superfluous as to perfecting any party's right to
 appeal and did not extend the time to appeal. The Thomas
 Appellants did not file their October 17, 2014 notice of appeal
 within thirty days after entry of the August 22, 2014 post-
judgment order granting Appellees Beneficial Hawaii and HSBC
 Finance's June 4, 2014 HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(B) post-judgment motion
 for an award of attorneys' fees and costs, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)
 required for a timely notice of appeal under these circumstances. 
Therefore, the Thomas Appellants' October 17, 2014 notice of
 
-6­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3).
 
The Thomas Appellants argue that we should deny 
Appellees Beneficial Hawaii and HSBC Finance's November 13, 2014 
motion to dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001189 for lack of appellate jurisdiction based on the "unique circumstances" doctrine under the holding in Cabral v. State, 127 Hawai
'i 175, 277 P.3d 269 (2012). However, Cabral is inapposite. 
In Cabral, the trial court filed an order extending the deadline to file a notice of appeal (before the original deadline expired), and the appellants delayed the filing of their notice of appeal in reliance on the extension order. Here, the circuit court did not file an order extending the deadline to file a notice of appeal and thus there was no extension order on which the Thomas Appellants could rely. As the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held, the failure to file a timely notice of appeal 
in a civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 
650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees Beneficial Hawaii
 
and HSBC Finance's November 13, 2014 motion to dismiss appellate
 
-7­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
court case number CAAP-14-0001189 for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction is granted, and appellate court case number CAAP-14­0001189 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
