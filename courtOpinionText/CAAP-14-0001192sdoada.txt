IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
SEUNG YE CHOI, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
DUKE G. FAJARDO, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL CASE NO. 1SS14-1-913)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Duke G. Fajardo (Fajardo) appeals
 
from an "Injunction Against Harassment" entered September 24,
 
2014 in the District Court of the First Circuit1
 (district
 
court).
 
Fajardo's sole point on appeal is that the district
 
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Fajardo had a
 "dating relationship" with Petitioner-Appellee Seung Ye Choi
 (
Choi). Fajardo contends because he was dating Choi, the family
 
court had exclusive jurisdiction. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 571-14(8) (Supp. 2014) and §§ 586-1 through 586-3 (2006 Repl.). 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief
 
submitted and having given due consideration to the arguments
 
advanced and the issues raised, as well as the relevant statutory
 and case law, we conclude Fajardo's appeal is without merit.
 
The district court found there was no consensual
 
relationship between Fajardo and Choi, who was married to her

husband during the time Fajardo alleged they had a consensual
 
relationship. This finding of the district court was dependent
 on the credibility of Choi and her husband and the lack of
 credibility of Fajardo, a province of the trier of fact. State
 
v. Mattiello, 90 Hawai
'i 255, 259, 978 P.2d 693, 697 (1999). 
Based on the district court's credibility determination
 
that there was not a consensual relationship, which would include
 "dating" between Fajardo and Choi, the district court did not err
 in concluding it had jurisdiction in the matter.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Injunction Against
 
Harassment" entered September 24, 2014 in the District Court of
 the First Circuit is affirmed.
