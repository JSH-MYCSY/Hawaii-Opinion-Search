APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In these consolidated appeals,1
 Defendant-Appellant
Kristopher Kane Kealoha (Kealoha), appeals from three August 20,
 
2014 Judgments of Conviction and Sentence in Cr. No. 12-1-0224,
 Cr No. 12-1-0387, and Cr. No. 13-1-0813 respectively, entered by
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).

On appeal, Kealoha argues that the Circuit Court erred 
in ordering restitution as part of his sentence, as restitution
 was not explicitly agreed-to in his plea agreement to which the
 Circuit Court agreed to be bound. Kealoha seeks remand for re-
sentencing or withdrawal of his guilty plea.

After a careful review of the parties' briefs, the
 
record on appeal, and the applicable law, and giving due
 
consideration to the point raised and arguments made by the
 parties, we resolve Kealoha's appeal as follows and affirm.
 
Kealoha argues that the Circuit Court erred in ordering
 
any restitution as he did not agree to pay restitution as part of
 his plea agreement with the State. Alternatively, Kealoha

maintains that, as the change of plea form  did not include a
specific amount of restitution, his plea was not knowing,
 intelligent, and voluntary as the imposition of restitution
 constituted a deviation from the specific terms of his plea
 agreement, to which the Circuit Court agreed to be bound.
 
The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
ordering restitution here because restitution was statutorily
 required in this case under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706­
4 5
646(2) (2014)  and § 706-605(7) (2014).  See State v. Feleunga,
 
125 Hawai 'i 475, 264 P.3d 53, No. 30450, 2011 WL 5561157 at *2 
(App. Nov. 15, 2011) (SDO) (no abuse of discretion in imposing
 
3 It is not clear to which form Kealoha refers. However, a specific
restitution amount does not appear on either his Guilty Plea form or the
attached "Exhibit 'A' to Guilty Plea form.
 
4 HRS § 706-646(2) provides, 
The court shall order the defendant to make restitution for
 
reasonable and verified losses suffered by the victim or
 victims as a result of the defendant's offense when
 requested by the victim. The court shall order restitution
 
to be paid to the crime victim compensation commission in
the event that the victim has been given an award for
compensation under chapter 351. If the court orders payment
of a fine in addition to restitution or a compensation fee,
or both, the payment of restitution and compensation fee
shall have priority over the payment of the fine, and
payment of restitution shall have priority over payment of a
compensation fee.
 
(Emphasis added.)

 HRS § 706-605(7) provides,
 
The court shall order the defendant to make restitution for
 
losses as provided in section 706-646. In ordering
restitution, the court shall not consider the defendant's
financial ability to make restitution in determining the
amount of restitution to order. The court, however, shall
consider the defendant's financial ability to make
restitution for the purpose of establishing the time and
manner of payment.

restitution because the court was statutorily required to order
 
restitution under HRS § 706-646).
 
Moreover, it appears that the parties did not come to
 
any agreement beyond the terms of incarceration for each of the
 offenses. First, the Exhibit A incorporated into Kealoha's
 guilty plea mentions no other possible penalties, including fines
 and compensation fees. Second, at sentencing, neither Kealoha,
 who was an active advocate in his own behalf, nor his counsel,
 ever objected to the imposition of restitution as outside the
 plea agreement. Rather, the discussion centered on Kealoha's
 ability to pay a judgment of restitution, during which defense
 counsel stated that "we talked about that," indicating that it
 was not a surprise. Thus, the record supports the conclusion
 that the plea agreement did not expressly include restitution,
 but did not prohibit it and in fact noted the possibility of
 restitution being imposed. Under these circumstances, the
 Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing
 restitution.
 A defendant need not be informed of collateral effects 
of conviction before pleading guilty but need only be informed of direct terms. See Reponte v. State, 57 Haw. 354, 363-64, 556 
P.2d 577, 584 (1976). This court has held that restitution is a collateral consequence of a no contest or guilty plea. State v. 
Tuialii, 121 Hawai
'i 135, 139, 214 P.3d 1125, 1129 (App. 2009).6 
Therefore, Kealoha's plea was not rendered involuntary because 
6
 We note that, as in Tuialii, Kealoha's guilty plea form in each of
 
the underlying cases, which he reviewed with his counsel, stated, 
6.	 I understand that the court may impose any of the
following penalties for the offense(s) to which I now
plead: the maximum term of imprisonment, any extended
term of imprisonment, and any mandatory minimum term
of imprisonment specified above, consecutive terms of
imprisonment (if more than one charge); restitution; a
fine; a fee and/or assessment, community service;
probation with up to one year of imprisonment and
other terms and conditions.

the Circuit Court did not specifically warn him of the
 
possibility of restitution.
 
Based on the foregoing, the August 20, 2014 Judgments
 
of Conviction and Sentence in Cr. No. 12-1-0224, Cr. No. 12-1­0387, and Cr. No. 13-1-0813 respectively, are affirmed.
