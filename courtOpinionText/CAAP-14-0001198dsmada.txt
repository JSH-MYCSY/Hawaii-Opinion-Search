record, it appears that (1) the parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal pursuant to Hawai

Rule 42(a), however, the appeal was docketed on December 19, 2014 and therefore the appeal may be dismissed pursuant to HRAP 42(b); (2) the Stipulation For Dismissal is dated and signed by counsel
 for the parties that have appeared in this appeal; and (3) the
 parties agree to bear their own costs and attorneys' fees on
 appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation
 
For Dismissal is approved and the appeal is dismissed with
 prejudice. The parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys'
 fees on appeal.
