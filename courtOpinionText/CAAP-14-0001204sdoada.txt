IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GREGORY LAVALSITI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(FC-CR. NO. 14-1-0023)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Fujise, Acting Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Gregory Lavalsiti (Lavalsiti)
appeals from the September 25, 2014 Judgment entered by the
Family Court of the Fifth Circuit (Family Court).1  Lavalsiti was
convicted of Abuse of a Family or Household Member, a violation
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 709-906(1)(5) (2014).  He
appeals his conviction solely on the ground that the Family Court
failed to dismiss this charge for a violation of Hawai #i Rules of
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48. 
After a careful review and consideration of the points
raised and the arguments made by the parties, the record, and the
applicable authority, we resolve Lavalsiti's points on appeal as
follows:
The Family Court adopted the HRPP Rule 48 computations
as presented by the State in its memorandum in opposition to
Lavalsiti's motion to dismiss.  That computation took the form of
a chart reproduced here:

Lavalsiti argues that the Family Court "erred when it
failed to dismiss the charge for violating [HRPP Rule] 48[2] for
2HRPP Rule 48(a) and (b), effective July 1, 2000, provides as
follows:
Rule 48. DISMISSAL.
(a)  By prosecutor.  The prosecutor may by leave of
court file a dismissal of a charge and the prosecution shall
thereupon terminate.  Such a dismissal may not be filed
during the trial without the consent of the defendant.
(b)  By court.  Except in the case of traffic offenses
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on
motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced
within 6 months:
(1)  from the date of arrest if bail is set  or
from the filing of the charge, whichever is sooner, on
any offense based on the same conduct or arising from
the same criminal episode for which the arrest or
charge was made; or
(2)  from the date of re-arrest or re-filing of
the charge, in cases where an initial charge was
dismissed upon motion of the defendant; or
(3)  from the date of mistrial, order granting a
new trial or remand, in cases where such events
require a new trial.

the period between the January 23, 2013 date of [his] arrest and
setting of bail, and the bringing of charges on February 4,
2014[.]"  As the Complaint was actually filed on February 7,
2014, and the Family Court actually excluded the period up until
this date, we consider this fifteen-day period excluded by the
Family Court.
On December 12, 2013, Lavalsiti was first arrested for
the instant offense, bail was set, he posted a bond, and he was
given the date of January 23, 20143 to appear in court.  As the
chart reflects, the calculation of time for HRPP Rule 48 purposes
began on the date of Lavalsiti's arrest and release on bail. 
HRPP Rule 48(b)(1).  Trial was set for July 30, 2014, and
Lavalsiti filed his motion to dismiss on the same date. 
Therefore, the interval between his arrest and trial was a total
of 230 days.  
In denying Lavalsiti's motion to dismiss, the Family
Court excluded a total of 64 days--including the fifteen days
between Lavalsiti's first appearance date on January 23, 2014,
and the date he was charged, February 7, 2014--which left a
period of 166 days for the purposes of HRPP Rule 48.  If this
fifteen-day period is not excludable, the total elapsed time for
HRPP Rule 48 purposes would be 166 + 15 = 181.  Thus, the
exclusion of this fifteen-day period is dispositive.
The Family Court stated, in ruling on this interval, 
I want to address the issue from the filing of the -- well,
the initial arraignment and plea when no Complaint was filed
to the date of the filing of the Complaint.  That date, to
this Court, because no charges were filed on January 23rd at
the initial arraignment date, unless it's different from the
transcripts, but this Court normally discharges the bond or
discharges the bail, refunds the bail.
2(...continued)
Clauses (b)(1) and (b)(2) shall not be applicable to
any offense for which the arrest was made or the charge was
filed prior to the effective date of the rule.
(Emphasis added).
3Although the court date the Bail/Bond form reads "January 23,
2013" it is clearly a clerical error as the form is dated December 12, 2013.

And, in fact, because no Complaint was filed, this
Court finds that at that point in time, that period of time
from when the bond is discharged -- nothing restricting the
liberty of the Defendant to the time the Complaint is filed
-- that is an excluded period, so that's 15 days.
However, this court has recently held in State v.
Visintin, CAAP-14-0000391, 2018 WL 950112 *18-21 (App. Feb. 20,
2018) that the "calendar call procedure," wherein an arrestee who
is released on bail without charges will have his bail refunded
or bond discharged if the State does not bring charges by the
time of first appearance, did not stop the HRPP Rule 48 clock
from running, nor did it constitute an excludable period under
HRPP Rule 48(c)(6) or (c)(8).  As this period was not excludable,
the Family Court erred in denying Lavalsiti's motion to dismiss
for violation of HRPP Rule 48.  Our resolution of this point
makes it unnecessary to consider Lavalsiti's other challenge to
the Family Court's decision.
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the Judgment entered
on September 25, 2014, and remand the case to the Family Court of
the Fifth Circuit for dismissal pursuant to HRPP Rule 48.  On
remand, the Family Court shall determine whether the dismissal
should be with or without prejudice.
