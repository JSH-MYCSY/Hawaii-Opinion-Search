SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Non-Party/Appellant, Father Walter Johnson appeals an
 
August 29, 2014 "Order Denying Non-Party Father Walter Johnson's
 
Motion to Intervene and For Protective Order Filed August 29,
 2014," entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit

represented by defendants and disclosure of his records would
 
violate his right to privacy under article I, section 6 of the
 Hawaii Constitution.
 
In addition to filing this appeal, Johnson filed a 
petition for writ of mandamus (Petition) with the Hawai
'i Supreme 
Court on October 1, 2014, seeking the nondisclosure of his employment records. On March 18, 2015, the supreme court issued an order denying Johnson's Petition on the grounds that he failed "to demonstrate that disclosure of the requested documents pursuant to the protective order issued by the Discovery Master violates article I, section 6 of the Hawai
'i Constitution." 
Moreover, a stay on disclosure issued by the supreme court was thereby lifted upon the denial of Johnson's Petition. 
This ruling of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court thus moots 
this appeal. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed as
 
moot.
