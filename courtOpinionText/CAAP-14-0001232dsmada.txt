(MASTER FILE NO. 00-1-MFL)
(CIVIL NOS. 98-5371-12 and 98-4706-10 )
 
ORDER DISMISSING ERIC Y. MARN'S
 
APPEAL PURSUANT TO HRAP RULE 30
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that 
(1) On October 29, 2014, Defendants-Appellants
 
Alexander Y. Marn (Alexander) and Eric Y. Marn (Eric), each pro
 se, filed a single notice of appeal;
 
(2) On December 29, 2014, the circuit court clerk filed
 
the record on appeal, and the appellate clerk notified the
 parties that the jurisdictional statement was due on or before
 January 8, 2015, and the opening brief was due on or before
 February 9, 2015;

(3) Neither Alexander nor Eric filed a jurisdictional
 
statement or opening brief;
 
(4) On February 26, 2015, the appellate clerk filed a 
notice of default of the jurisdictional statement and opening 
brief for Alexander and Eric, noting that the appeal may be dismissed, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
30, and relief from default should be made by motion; 
(5) Alexander filed a late jurisdictional statement on
 
February 27, 2015, and Eric filed a "joinder" in Alexander's
 jurisdictional statement on March 3, 2015;
 
(6) On March 6, 2015, Alexander filed what the court
 
construed as a motion for relief from default of the
 jurisdictional statement and opening brief, and an extension of
 time for the opening brief;
 
(7) On March 9, 2015, Eric filed what the court
 
construed as a motion for relief from default of the
 jurisdictional statement (requesting a one week extension), and
 joinder in Alexander's March 6, 2015 motion;
 
(8) On March 16, 2015, the court granted Alexander's
 
requested relief, accepted his late-filed jurisdictional
 statement, and extended his opening brief due date;
 
(9) Alexander subsequently retained an attorney, who
 
filed an opening brief for Alexander on May 11, 2015;
 
(10) With respect to Eric, the court stated the
 
following in the March 16, 2015 order:
 
Eric is cautioned that the proper response to
a notice of default of the jurisdictional
statement and of the opening brief is a
motion for relief from default rather than

filing a late request to extend time to file
the jurisdictional statement, and that
irrespective of review and preparation of a
large volume of appeal documents, he is
nonetheless responsible for timely meeting
deadlines for the filing of documents or
requests for extensions. [Eric's joinder in]
Alexander's motion to extend the due date of
 
Alexander's  opening brief . . . does not
serve as a motion to extend the due date of
 
Eric's
 opening brief, and Eric's opening
brief remains in default, without any motion
for relief from default of the opening brief
having been filed.
 
(Emphasis in original.) Ultimately, the court granted Eric's
 
requested relief, extended the jurisdictional statement due date
 to March 16, 2015, and noted, "Eric's opening brief remains in
 default, and Eric's appeal may be dismissed"; and
 
(11) Eric filed his jurisdictional statement late on
 
March 17, 2015, but has not filed an opening brief or sought
 relief from default of the opening brief.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Eric Y. Marn's
 
appeal in case number CAAP-14-0001232 is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, May 21, 2015.
