NO. CAAP-14-0001245
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
EILEEN SHAVELSON, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
KITAAMI, JEFFERY HIRANAKA, HARVEY T. HIRANAKA, ANNA HIRANAKA,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-000137)

 
ORDER
 
(1) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
AND
 
(2) DENYING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
does not have appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Eileen Shavelson’s (Appellant Shavelson) appeal from the proposed
 judgment that Appellant Shavelson apparently submitted to the
 circuit court, which the Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano appears
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to have stamped with the word "DENIED," along with his 
accompanying signature, on October 7, 2014. The circuit court's October 7, 2014 denial of Appellant Shavelson's request for entry of judgment is not independently appealable, and the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final judgment on all claims, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013) requires for an appeal from a civil circuit court case under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i 
holds "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 
1186 (2008). When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (original emphasis). 
"An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in 
favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). The record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001245 was filed on December 29, 2014, and the circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment on all claims in this case. Absent a separate judgment, the circuit court's October 7, 2014 denial of Appellant Shavelson's request for entry of judgment is not eligible for appellate review. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001245 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001245 are denied as
 moot.
