OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
v.
 
 
PAALANI M. WOODS, Defendant-Appellant
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
 
(Honolulu Division)

(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-00087)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Paalani M. Woods (Woods) with operating a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (2007) (Count 1), and inattention to driving, in violation of HRS § 291-12 (Supp. 2015) (Count 2). Prior to trial, Woods filed several motions to suppress evidence. Without Woods' agreement and over his subsequent objection, the District Court 
1

of the First Circuit (District Court)  did not decide Woods'
 
suppression motions before trial, but instead consolidated the

 
hearing on Woods' suppression motions with his trial.2 The
 
1The Honorable Paul B.K. Wong presided.
 
2The record indicates confusion and the lack of clarity over
whether witnesses were testifying in a pretrial hearing on the
suppression motions or in a hearing on the motions that had been
 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 


 

 



 



 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
District Court found Woods guilty of OVUII in violation of HRS 
3§ 291E-61(a)(1)  and inattention to driving.  The District Court 
 
 
entered its Judgment on October 7, 2014. 
On appeal, Woods contends that the District Court erred
 
in: (1) incorporating his pretrial motions to suppress evidence
 
into the trial over his objection; (2) conducting a hearing on
 pretrial motions on the same day as trial over his objection; (3)
 depriving him of his right to transcripts of pretrial motions;
 (4) denying his motion to dismiss the OVUII charge for failure to
 allege the statutory definition of alcohol; and (5) failing to
 
4
find a Brady violation  when the State demanded payment of a fee
 
as a condition to his being permitted to inspect discovery. 
The circumstances of Woods' case appear to be similar 
to those in State v. Rollison, CAAP-14-0000765, 2015 WL 7575334 (Hawai
'i App. Nov. 25, 2015) (SDO), and the issues Woods raises 
in this appeal were included in the issues raised in Rollison. We resolve the issues Woods raises in this appeal by adopting and applying our analysis in Rollison with respect to those issues. 
In particular, we conclude that under Hawai
'i Rules of 
5
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12(e) (2007)  and State v. Thomas,  72
 
Haw. 48, 53-54, 805 P.2d 1212, 1214-15 (1991), the District Court

 
erred in failing to decide Woods' suppression motions before
 trial, where the record does not show that Woods agreed to
 consolidate the hearing on the suppression motions with his
 trial. Rollison, 2015 WL 7575334 at *1. Based on this error, we
 
conclude that Woods' convictions must be vacated. Id. at *1, *3. 
We also reiterate our statement in Rollison that "[w]hile it may
 
consolidated with the trial.
 
3The District Court granted Woods' motion for judgment of
acquittal as to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proving OVUII. 
4See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)
 
5HRPP Rule 12(e) provides in relevant part that "a motion to
suppress made before trial shall be determined before trial."

be permissible for the State to charge a defendant for copying
 
costs where the defendant requests copies of materials subject to
 disclosure, the State cannot condition the disclosure of Brady
 material or discovery on the payment for copies that the
 defendant does not want." Id. at *2. If discovery is required,
 
the State cannot preclude a defendant from inspecting discovery
 materials on the ground that the defendant refuses to pay a fee. 
As in Rollison, we vacate the District Court's
 
Judgment. We remand the case for a new trial on the HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) portion of the OVUII charge (Count 1) and the
 inattention to driving charge (Count 2) and for further
 proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
