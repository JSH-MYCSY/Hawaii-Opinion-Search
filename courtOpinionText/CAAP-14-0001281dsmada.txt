GRANTING DECEMBER 8, 2014 MOTION TO DISMISS

APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND

 
STRIKING JANUARY 8, 2015 SUPPLEMENTAL
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF DECEMBER 8, 2014 MOTION TO DISMISS
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Ran Yasumi's 

(Appellee Ran Yasumi), December 8, 2014 motion to dismiss
 
appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001281 for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction, (2) Appellee Ran Yasumi's January 8, 2015
 supplemental memorandum in support of her December 8, 2014 motion
 to dismiss, (3) the lack of any opposition by Defendant-Appellant
 Yoshio Yasumi (Appellant Yoshio Yasumi) to Appellee Ran Yasumi's
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
December 8, 2014 motion to dismiss, and (4) the record, it
 
appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Yoshio
 Yasumi's appeal from the Honorable Sherri-Ann L. Iha's
 
•
	 October 9, 2014 interlocutory order denying
Appellant Yoshio Yasumi's motion to dismiss
Appellee Ran Yasumi's complaint for divorce, and
 
•	 December 11, 2014 interlocutory order denying
three related motions by Appellant Yoshio Yasumi.
 
Neither of the two appealed interlocutory orders
 
qualifies as an independently appealable final order or decree
 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006), which
 provides that "[a]n interested party aggrieved by any order or
 decree of the court may appeal to the intermediate appellate
 court for review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms
 and conditions as in other cases in the 
circuit court [.]"
 
(Emphasis added). In circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may
 appeal from "final judgments, orders or decrees[.]" HRS § 641­1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014). This divorce case would be appealable
 only if the family court would enter a final judgment, order or
 decree that, at a minimum, dissolves the marriage of Appellant
 Yoshio Yasumi and Appellee Ran Yasumi.
 
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
 
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support; and
 (4) division and distribution of property and debts. 
Black 
 
v. Black, 6 Haw. App. [493], 728 P.2d 1303 (1986). In
 Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided. Although we recommend that,
except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we
conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is
final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3),
and (4) remain undecided; that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided; and that if parts (2), (3),
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided. 
Eaton v. Eaton, 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987) 
(footnote omitted); see also Riethbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai 'i 1, 
18, 282 P.3d 543, 560 (2012) (citing and quoting Eaton v. Eaton); Kakinami v. Kakinami, 125 Hawai
'i 308, 312-13, 260 P.3d 1126, 
1130-31 (2011) (citing and quoting Eaton v. Eaton). Neither of the two appealed interlocutory orders is independently appealable under HRS § 571-54 and the holding in Eaton v. Eaton because the family court has not yet dissolved the marriage between Appellant Yoshio Yasumi and Appellee Ran Yasumi. 
Although exceptions to the finality requirement exist 
under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641­1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2014), neither of the two appealed interlocutory orders satisfies the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent an independently appealable final judgment,
 
order or decree, we lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal,
 and Appellant Yoshio Yasumi's appeal from the two interlocutory
 orders is premature.

It further appears, however, that Appellee Ran Yasumi 
did not obtain this court's permission to file her January 8, 
2015 supplemental memorandum in support of her December 8, 2014 motion to dismiss, despite that Rule 27 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) does not authorize a movant to file two memoranda in support of a motion. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Ran Yasumi's
 
December 8, 2014 motion to dismiss is granted, and this case is
 dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Ran Yasumi's
 
January 8, 2015 supplemental memorandum in support of Appellee
 Ran Yasumi's December 8, 2014 motion to dismiss appellate court
 case number CAAP-14-0001281 is stricken from the record, and we
 do not consider Appellee Ran Yasumi's January 8, 2015
 supplemental memorandum in making our decision to dismiss this
 appeal, because HRAP Rule 27 does not authorize a movant to file
 such a supplemental memorandum and Appellee Ran Yasumi failed to
 obtain leave from the court to file a Supplemental Memorandum.
