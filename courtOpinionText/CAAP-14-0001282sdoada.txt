NO. CAAP-14-0001282
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
HANS C. HUBER, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2DTA-13-00043)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i (State) appeals 
from (1) the September 17, 2014 Order entered by the District 
Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court)1 
granting Defendant-Appellee Hans C. Huber's (Huber) first motion to suppress (Motion to Suppress) and (2) the October 23, 2014 "Decision and Order Granting Defendant's First Motion to Suppress Filed January 14, 2014" that contained the District Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Huber's Motion to Suppress sought suppression of all evidence obtained as a result of Officer Carl Eguia's (Officer Eguia) traffic stop on the basis that the stop was unlawful. 
On appeal, the State argues that the District Court
 
erred in granting the Motion to Suppress where the traffic stop
 was lawful.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve the State's points of error as follows.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Huber's Motion to Suppress turned on whether Officer
 
Eguia had reasonable suspicion to stop Huber's vehicle. It is
 
well-established that a police officer has the authority to stop
 a vehicle based on an observed traffic violation. State v.
 
Bonds
, 59 Haw. 130, 135, 577 P.2d 781, 785 (1978).
 
"In discharging their varied responsibilities for ensuring
the public safety, law enforcement officials are necessarily
brought into frequent contact with automobiles. Most of
 this contact is distinctly noncriminal in nature . . . .
Automobiles, unlike homes, are subjected to pervasive and
continuing governmental regulation and controls, including
periodic inspection and licensing requirements. As an
 everyday occurrence, police stop and examine vehicles when
license plates or inspection stickers have expired, or if
other violations, such as exhaust fumes or excessive noise,
are noted, or if headlights or other safety equipment are
not in proper working order." South Dakota v. Opperman, 428
U.S. 364, 367–68, 96 S. Ct. 3092, 3095–3096, 49 L. Ed. 2d
1000 (1976).
 
Id. (internal block quotation format omitted). Thus, an
 
officer's authority to stop an automobile is not limited to
 
circumstances indicating criminal activity.
 
Officer Eguia testified that the reason he signaled
 
Huber to stop his car was that Huber's tail lights were out. The
 District Court made no finding whether Officer Eguia had reason
 to believe a traffic violation had been committed, which was a
 necessary prerequisite to its decision regarding the legality of
 the stop. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the September 17,
 
2014 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,
 and the October 23, 2014 "Decision and Order Granting Defendant's
 First Motion to Suppress Filed January 14, 2014" in the District
 Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division are vacated and the
 case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
 summary disposition order.
