APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-494K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Alexa Nita
 
Russell’s (Appellant Russell) appeal from the Honorable Elizabeth
 A. Strance's October 7, 2014 interlocutory order granting
 Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of America, N.A.'s (Appellee Bank of
 America), motion for a second extension of time to file a
 pretrial statement (the October 7, 2014 interlocutory order)
 because the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final
 judgment, as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51 (Supp. 2014)
 and HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014) require for an appeal from
 a civil circuit court foreclosure case such as this.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court has not yet entered any judgment on 
Appellee Bank of America's complaint for foreclosure in this 
case. Although exceptions to the judgment requirement exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, HRS § 641-1(b), the circuit court's October 7, 2014 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Therefore, the circuit court's October 7, 2014 interlocutory order is not independently appealable. Absent an appealable final judgment, Appellant Russell's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001286. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001286 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
