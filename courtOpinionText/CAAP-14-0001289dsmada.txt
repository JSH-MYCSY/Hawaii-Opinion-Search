because the circuit court has not yet entered a final judgment as 
to all claims, as Hawaii Revised Statutes § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014) requires for an appeal under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994) ("An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]"). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee City of
 
Honolulu's December 17, 2014 motion to dismiss appellate court
 case number CAAP-14-0001289 is granted, and appellate court case
 number CAAP-14-0001289 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
