APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 09-1-000044)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.;
with Foley, Presiding Judge, dissenting)
 
Defendant-Appellant Darryl J. Oliveira (Darryl) appeals

(family court).
 
On appeal, Darryl contends that the family court erred
 
in denying his motion for post-decree relief under Hawai 'i Family

Plaintiff-Appellee Patricia E. Breault, formerly known as
 
Patricia E. Breault Oliveira (Patricia), constituted fraud upon
 
the court and (2) the divorce decree was unconscionable.3
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Darryl and Patricia were married on April 28, 1994.
 
Patricia filed for divorce in 2009. With the assistance of an
 
attorney, Patricia had a divorce agreement drafted. The
 agreement and a proposed divorce decree were drafted, signed by
 both parties, and Patricia filed the documents with the family
 court. On April 24, 2009, the family court entered the divorce
 decree (Divorce Decree), which had been signed as approved by
 
both Patricia and Darryl. The Divorce Decree provided in
 
pertinent part that "[n]either party shall be required to pay
 alimony to the other party[,]" but also provided that "[i]n
 
2(...continued)
representative from any or all of the provisions of a final
judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence
could not have been discovered in time to move for a new
 trial under Rule 59(b) of these rules or to reconsider,
alter, or amend under Rule 59(e);
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or
extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party;
(4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment.
The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and
for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after

the judgment, order, or proceedings was entered or taken.
For reasons (1) and (3) the averments in the motion shall be
made in compliance with Rule 9(b) of these rules. A motion
under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a
judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does not limit
the power of a court to entertain an independent action to
relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to
set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.

outside of the scope of his motion for post-decree relief.

consideration for Wife waiving her claim to Husband's retirement,
 
Husband agrees that he will provide Wife an equalization payment
 of $2400, per month, for a period of 360 months." Neither party
 appealed from the Divorce Decree.
 
On February 15, 2012, nearly three years later, Darryl
 
filed a "Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree Relief." Darryl
 requested the family court reclassify the "equalization payments"
 agreed to in the divorce as "alimony," and for the court to void
 the payments moving forward. In support of his motion, Darryl
 appears to have contended that the divorce agreement was
 unconscionable due to one-sidedness, his agreement was an obvious
 mistake of fact and law, he may have been fraudulently induced to
 agree to the terms of the agreement, and Patricia committed
 multiple acts of fraud during the proceedings. 
On October 14, 2014, the family court entered the Order
 
Denying Relief. In the Order, the family court treated Darryl's
 motion as a request for relief under HFCR Rule 60(b). The family
 court determined that Darryl's claim that Patricia had engaged in
 fraud was untimely under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) because a motion for
 relief under Rule 60(b)(3) must be filed within one year. The
 family court further concluded that the alleged acts of fraud did
 not amount to fraud upon the court under HFCR Rule 60(b)(6),
 which does not have a one year filing deadline and instead
 requires motions for relief be filed "within a reasonable time."

Regarding Darryl's argument that the agreement was unconscionable
 and should be set aside, the family court noted that, (1) "[t]he
 evidence presented at the hearing on [Darryl's] motion made it
 clear that the parties intended that in exchange for releasing
 her claim to any portion of [Darryl's] retirement [Patricia]
 would receive from [Darryl] enough money to retain the marital
 residence[;]" (2) the 2009 Divorce Decree was "executed by
 [Darryl] voluntarily after a full opportunity to review its

reasonable time.

terms[;]" and (3) while it was "unfortunate but not
 
extraordinary" that Darryl has found it difficult to comply with
 the terms, the court would not "relieve him from the choices he
 has made," and declined to afford him relief under HFCR Rule
 60(b)(6).
 
Darryl timely filed his notice of appeal on November
 
13, 2014, only contending that relief should have been granted
 under HFCR Rule 60(b)(6).
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"The family court's denial of a motion under HFCR Rule
 
60(b)(6) is reviewed for abuse of discretion." Cvitanovich-Dubie
 
v. Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i 128, 139, 254 P.3d 439, 450 (2011) 
(citation omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Fraud Upon the Court
 
Darryl contends Patricia engaged in "fraud upon the 
court" and, based upon that fraud, the family court should have granted Darryl relief from the Divorce Decree under HFCR Rule 60(b)(6).
5 If the alleged fraud does not amount to fraud on the 
court, it falls under the provisions of HFCR Rule 60(b)(3), Cvitanovich-Dubie, 125 Hawai
'i at 144-46, 254 P.3d at 455-57, 
and, as the family court ruled, Darryl's motion for relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3) was untimely. 
"Although fraud upon the court has eluded exact 
definition, . . . fraud upon the court 'is more than mere fraud.'" Standard Mgmt., Inc. v. Kekona, 98 Hawai
'i 95, 100, 43 
P.3d 232, 237 (App. 2001) (footnote omitted) (quoting Se. Colo. Water Conservancy Dist. v. Cache Creek Mining Tr., 854 P.2d 167, 176 (Colo. 1993)). "Since the remedy for fraud on the court is 
5 "Rule 60(b), HFCR, is similar to Rule 60(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil
Procedure (HRCP) and Rule 60(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP),

except for some minor variations which do not affect the provisions concerned
here. Therefore, the treatises and cases interpreting HRCP, Rule 60(b) and
FRCP, Rule 60(b) provide persuasive reasoning for the interpretation of HFCR
60(b)." Hayashi v. Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. 286, 290 n.6, 666 P.2d 171, 174 n.6
 
(1983).

far reaching, it only applies to very unusual cases involving 
'far more than an injury to a single litigant,' but rather, a 'corruption of the judicial process itself.'" Schefke v. 
Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai
'i 408, 431 n.42, 32 
P.3d 52, 75 n.42 (2001) (citations and brackets omitted) (quoting 11 C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d ยง 2870, at 413-414, 418 (1995)). The fraud "must be a 'direct assault on the integrity of the judicial process.' . . . Examples of such fraud include 'bribery of a judge,' and 'the employment of counsel in order to bring an improper influence on the court.'" Id. at 431, 32 P.3d at 75 
(citations omitted) (quoting 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, supra, at 416-19). Fraud on the court must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Id. 
Darryl asserted that Patricia committed a litany of
 
fraudulent acts that amount to fraud on the court, including:
 Patricia filed affidavits which contained falsehoods, including
 that the divorce agreement did not deviate from the partnership
 model; she induced Darryl to sign the divorce agreement, which
 she knew to be unenforceable; she prevented Darryl from meeting
 with Brian De Lima (De Lima), the attorney who drafted an earlier
 version of the divorce agreement and who had met with Patricia,
 despite De Lima's request to meet with Darryl; and she knowingly
 filed an unenforceable divorce agreement which manipulated the
 court into becoming an instrument to fraud. 
Even if we assume Darryl's allegations are true,
 
Patricia's actions do not amount to "fraud upon the court." 
Darryl signed the Divorce Decree and the divorce agreement
 indicating his agreement to the terms of the divorce, both of
 which expressly state that "[i]n consideration for Wife waiving
 her claim to Husband's retirement, Husband agrees that he will
 provide Wife an equalization payment of $2400, per month, for a
 period of 360 months." Darryl apparently did not consult his own
 attorney before signing, moreover he submitted an "Answer to
 Complaint" signed by him which states: "I have received and read
 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Complaint for Divorce, the Matrimonial Action Information
 
form, and the Divorce Decree and I agree to all terms set within
 and upon these documents." Further, Patricia's representation
 that the divorce agreement did not deviate from the partnership
 
6
model is in essence a legal assertion  and, even if incorrect, is
not equivalent to bribery of a judge or bringing an improper
 influence on the court. Any perceived "unenforceability" of the
 divorce agreement does not amount to a corruption of the judicial
 process itself. Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its
 discretion in denying Darryl's motion for relief to the extent it
 was based on fraud on the court.
 
B. Unconscionability
 
Darryl also contends the family court erred by denying
 
his request for post-decree relief on the grounds that the
 
Divorce Decree was unconscionable. 
The family court treated Darryl's claim of
 
unconscionability as a request for relief under HCFR Rule
 60(b)(6). Darryl does not assign any error to this, admitting in
 his opening brief that "[t]he Family Court correctly found that
 Rule 60(b)(6) could be applied to claims for relief on the
 grounds of unconscionability . . . ." 
Rule 60(b)(6) empowers the court in its discretion to
vacate a judgment whenever that action is appropriate to
accomplish justice. Like HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), it has no
statute of limitations. However,
 
The broad power granted by clause (6) is not for the
purpose of relieving a party from free, calculated and
deliberate choices he has made. A party remains under
a duty to take legal steps to protect his own
interests. In particular, it ordinarily is not
permissible to use this motion to remedy a failure to
take an appeal. However, this is not an inflexible
rule and in unusual cases a party who has not taken an
appeal may obtain relief on motion.

ยง 2864 (1973).

the time of appeal has run must establish the existence of
"extraordinary circumstances" that prevented or rendered him
unable to prosecute an appeal. Martella v. Marine Cooks and
 
Stewards Union, 448 F.2d 729 (9th Cir. 1971); see also Annat
 v. Beard, 277 F.2d 554 (5th Cir. 1960)[,] cert. denied, 364
U.S. 908, 81 S.Ct. 270, 5 L.Ed.2d 223. 
In re Hana Ranch Co., Ltd., 3 Haw. App. 141, 147, 642 P.2d 938, 
942 (1982)(emphasis added); see also Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i 144, 148-49, 883 P.2d 65, 69-70 (1994) (quoting Hana 
Ranch and holding that a party's failure to object to a settlement agreement for three years indicated ratification); Citicorp Mortg. Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 436-37, 16 
P.3d 827, 841-42 (App. 2000) (quoting Hana Ranch and holding that there were no "extraordinary circumstances" that precluded an appeal); Int'l Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai
'i 
464, 474, 5 P.3d 454, 464 (App. 2000) (quoting Hana Ranch and holding that there were no "extraordinary circumstances" that precluded the party from timely appealing). 
Darryl has failed to point to any "extraordinary
 
circumstances" that prevented him from appealing from the Divorce
 Decree. In his opening brief, Darryl does not expressly explain
 why he did not appeal from the Divorce Decree. At most, Darryl
 asserts that he had "little chance to discover Patricia's fraud
 since it was ostensibly protected by the attorney-client
 privilege." According to Darryl, after he filed his motion for
 post-decree relief, discovery disputes arose because of claimed
 attorney-client privilege between Patricia and De Lima. However,
 this contention does not address why Darryl could not have
 retained his own counsel to review the Divorce Decree, nor does
 he claim that he made an effort at any time to meet with De Lima
 but was thwarted by someone asserting an attorney-client
 privilege between Patricia and De Lima. In short, Darryl
 provides no explanation for deciding to abide by the evident
 terms of the Divorce Decree without complaint for almost three
 years. He has not demonstrated any "extraordinary circumstances"
 that prevented him from appealing when the Divorce Decree was
 entered.

Given the record in this case, the family court did not
 
abuse its discretion in denying Darryl's request for relief under
 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(6).
