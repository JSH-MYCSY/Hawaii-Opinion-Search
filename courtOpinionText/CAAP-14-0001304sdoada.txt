SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant pro se
 
Sylvia Cabral (Cabral) appeals from the (1) "Order Denying
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration; Writ of Stay Injunction;
 
Lis Pendens; Service by Fax or Email, Filed on 8-18-14 and
 Amended Motion for Reconsideration; Request for Notice of
 Pendency of Action; Lis Pendens; Injunction; Request for Notice
 by Fax or Email, Filed on 9-12-14," entered on October 28, 2014,
 and (2) "Order Granting Defendants' Motion to Enforce Settlement
 Agreement and Dismiss All Claims with Prejudice" (Settlement
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Agreement Order), entered on September 4, 2014, in the Circuit
 
Court of the Second Circuit1
 (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Cabral argues that the circuit court erred
 
in (1) removing the lis pendens and (2) interpreting the terms of
 
the settlement agreement between Cabral, Defendant/Counterclaim­Plaintiff/Appellee Palisade Pointe Estates, Inc. 
(Palisade
Pointe), and Intervenor/Appellee Great American Hotels and
 
Resorts, Inc. (Great American) as binding upon Cabral.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Cabral's
 appeal is without merit.
 
Cabral challenges the circuit court's denial of her 
"Motion for Reconsideration; Writ Stay Injunction; Lis Pendens" (Motion for Reconsideration) and argues that the circuit court 
erred in removing her lis pendens. Cabral's Motion for 
Reconsideration, however, provided no discernible lis pendens argument for the circuit court to consider. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in denying the motion. See Ass'n of 
Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai
'i 
97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal."). 
Cabral also challenges the circuit court's Settlement
 
Agreement Order. Cabral appears to argue that the circuit court
 erred in determining the settlement agreement was binding on
 Cabral because not all of the conditions of the agreement had
 been met.
 
Palisade Pointe and Great American attached a copy of
 
the settlement agreement to their "Motion to Enforce Settlement
 Agreement and Dismiss All Claims with Prejudice" (Motion to
 
Enforce Settlement Agreement). The settlement agreement
 
provided, inter alia:
 
1. [Cabral] will have 90 days after acceptance,
confirming that the title to the Properties is good and
 
1
 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
marketable and insurable and clear and without encumbrances,
to raise the sum of $430,000.00 in cash and to pay that
money to Palisade.
 
2.
 At the same time that Palisade receives the
 
$430,000.00, it and Great American will deed the Properties
to [Cabral] or her assignee, and that transaction will go
through escrow if any party requests an escrow.
 
. . . .
 
6. If [Cabral] comes to [Palisade Pointe] and Great
American for an extension of this Agreement, stating good
cause, [Palisade Pointe] and Great American will consider an
extension.
 
7. When the option is exercised or at the exhaustion
of the 90 day period, or after any extension, the case,
Cabral v. Palisade and Edward Bates, Civil No. 03-1-0212,
will be dismissed with prejudice, and no party will appeal
from that dismissal, and each party will pay her and its own
costs and fees.
 
The settlement agreement was dated and signed by Cabral; Palisade
 
Pointe's president, Edward Bates; and Great American's president,
 James B. Salmon.
 
Cabral's "Answer to the Motion to Enforce Settlement
 
Agreement" failed to present any facts or legal arguments that
 challenge the enforcibility of the settlement agreement.
 Additionally, Cabral did not dispute in her response to the
 Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, and does not dispute on
 appeal, that she (1) failed to exercise her option to purchase
 the property within 90-days and (2) did not request an extension
 of time during the 90-day period.
 
Based on the record before us, the settlement agreement
 
was enforceable against Cabral and Cabral was bound to the
 agreement's provisions. See Sylvester v. Animal Emergency Clinic
 
of Oahu, 72 Haw. 560, 570-71, 825 P.2d 1053, 1058-59 (1992). 
Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in granting the Motion
 to Enforce Settlement Agreement nor did the circuit court err in
 dismissing all of Cabral's claims.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that (1) the "Order Denying
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration; Writ of Stay Injunction;
 Lis Pendens; Service by Fax or Email, Filed on 8-18-14 and
 Amended Motion for Reconsideration; Request for Notice of

 and (2) the "Order Granting Defendants' Motion to Enforce
 Settlement Agreement and Dismiss All Claims with Prejudice,"
 entered on September 4, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the Second
 Circuit are affirmed.
