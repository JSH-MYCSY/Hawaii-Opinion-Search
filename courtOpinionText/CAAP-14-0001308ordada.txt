NO. CAAP-14-0001308
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
In the Matter of the SHARON M. Y. YOUNG 
REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST AGREEMENT
 
Dated April 28, 1995
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. T-05-1-0001)

 
ORDER: (1) DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE
JURISDICTION; (2) DENYING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS

MOOT; AND (3) TAKING NO FURTHER ACTION ON ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE FILED ON JANUARY 19, 2016
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Beneficiary-Appellant Mark Young's 
(Appellant Young) appeal from the Honorable Derrick H.M. Chan's October 21, 2014 "Order Granting Petition for Approval of the Trustee's First Account Through Ninth Account, Appointing Successor Co-Trustees and Vesting Title" (October 21, 2014 Order). 
The probate court has not yet entered a final judgment 
terminating the underlying proceedings, or a separate judgment on the October 21, 2014 Order as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP), as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641­1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2015) and Rule 34(a) of the Hawai
'i Probate 
Rules (HPR) require for an appeal from a trust proceeding under these circumstances. 











 





 





 "When we perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal,
 
 
this court must, sua sponte, dismiss the appeal." Ciesla v. 
 
 
Reddish, 78 Hawai 'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (citation 
omitted). HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2015) is the law that authorizes
 
 
appeals from a probate court's final judgments, orders, or
 
 
decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner
 
 
. . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c) (1993). 
 
HPR Rule 34 applies to, among other things, trust proceedings
 
 
(see HPR Rule 1), and generally requires the entry of a judgment
 
 
for an appeal:
 
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS.
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and 

parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other 

orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed 

pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 

applicable to civil actions. 
 
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphasis added). "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see, 
 
 
e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 
 
P.2d 1334 (1994), to bring certainty to the timing of when and
 
 
how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with the provisions of
 
 
HRS § 641-1." HPR Rule 34 cmt.
 
 
Under the holding in 
Jenkins, "[a]n appeal may be
 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment
 
 
and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the
 
 
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" 76 Hawai 'i at 
-2 ­

 
 

 


 

 

 

 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 
P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphasis omitted). 
Thus, in cases where HPR Rule 34 applies, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that when "final judgment terminating the 
proceeding has not been entered, and these [appealed] orders were not certified for appeal[,] . . . those orders are not before us." In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai
'i 211, 223, 151 
P.3d 692, 704 (2006). 
On January 8, 2015, the probate court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001308
 which does not contain an appealable final HPR Rule 34 judgment. 
Appellant Young contends that an exception to the final judgment
 requirement, the Forgay doctrine, applies to give this court
 jurisdiction over the October 21, 2014 Order. See Forgay v.
 
Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). As described in Ciesla,
 
We have jurisdiction to consider appeals from judgments
 
which "require[ ] immediate execution of a command that
 
property be delivered to the appellant's adversary, and the
 
losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if
 
appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the
 
litigation." Penn v. Transportation Lease Haw., Ltd., 2
 
Haw.App. 272, 274, 630 P.2d 646, 649 (1981) (citing Forgay
 
 
v. Conrad, 47 U.S. (6 Haw.) 201, 12 L.Ed. 404 (1848)). The
 
Forgay doctrine is an exception to the finality requirement
 
for appeals and it allows an appellant to immediately appeal
 
a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims
 
of the parties have not been finally resolved.
 
 
Ciesla, 78 Hawai 'i at 20, 889 P.2d at 704. Appellant Young 
contends that the Forgay doctrine applies because the October 21, 2014 Order requires the immediate execution of property and irreparable harm because property must be sold to satisfy the ordered attorney's fees and master's fees; discharge of the deceased former trustee causes permanent harm because the former

 trustee's estate will distribute and there will be no assets left to pursue; and discharge of the deceased former trustee extinguishes the beneficiaries' right to a jury trial. Despite Appellant Young's contentions, the October 21, 2014 Order does not require the immediate execution of a command to deliver property to Appellant Young's adversary. See Greer v. Baker, 137 
Hawai
'i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (noting that the 
Forgay doctrine authorizes appeals from a judgment for immediate execution against an interest in real property). 
Moreover, neither of the other two exceptions to the 
final judgment requirement (the collateral order doctrine and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993) apply. See Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & 
Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). 
Absent an appealable judgment, we lack appellate
 
jurisdiction and Appellant Young's appeal is premature. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001308 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001308 are denied as
 moot.
 
Additionally, in light of the dismissal of this appeal
 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction, we will take no further
 action with regard to the order to show cause issued on January
 19, 2016 to attorney Frank T. Kanemitsu (Kanemitsu). However, we
 strongly caution Kanemitsu because he was the attorney of record
 in this appeal and received notice of Appellant Young's Notice of
 Appeal, Statement of Jurisdiction, and opening brief, and this
 court's April 24, 2015 Order instructing his client to file an
 answering brief; yet, Kanemitsu failed to file an answering
 brief, a statement contesting jurisdiction, or a timely
 Suggestion of Death regarding his client having passed away. Due

 to Kanemitsu's inactivity, his client was declared in default of
 
the answering brief. Repetition of such actions in the future
 may result in sanctions.
