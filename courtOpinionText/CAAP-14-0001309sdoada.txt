 On appeal, the Krakauers did not raise any arguments that
pertained to the circuit court's Order Granting Motion for Instructions.
Moreover, we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review this order on
appeal. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a) (Supp. 2015) authorizes
appeals from three different types of judgments in a foreclosure action.

taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosure case shall be
final and appealable:
 
(1) 	A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure, and if
the judgment incorporates an order of sale or an
adjudication of a movant's right to a deficiency
judgment, or both, then the order of sale or the
adjudication of liability for the deficiency judgment
also shall be deemed final and appealable;
 
(2) 	A judgment entered on an order confirming the sale of
the foreclosed property, if the circuit court
expressly finds that no just reason for delay exists,
and certifies the judgment as final pursuant to rule
54(b) of the Hawaii rules of civil procedure; and
 
(3) 	A deficiency judgment; provided that no appeal from a
deficiency judgment shall raise issues relating to the
judgment debtor's liability for the deficiency
judgment (as opposed to the amount of the deficiency
judgment), nor shall the appeal affect the finality of
the transfer of title to the foreclosed property
pursuant to the order confirming sale.
 
(b) An appeal shall be taken in the manner and within the
time provided by the rules of court.
 
(Emphases added.) 
HRS § 667-51(a)(1) authorized an appeal from the circuit court's
June 5, 2014 Judgment, which granted summary judgment and a decree of
foreclosure in favor for Wells Fargo, but the Krakauers did not appeal from
the Judgment.
 
The next proceeding in this case involved the sale of the
foreclosed property. The circuit court's October 20, 2014 Order GrantingMotion for Instructions merely waived the requirement that the foreclosurecommissioner conduct open houses for public viewing of the foreclosedproperty. A sale proceeding does not end until the circuit court formallyconfirms the sale of the foreclosed property and enters a correspondingjudgment, which then will be appealable pursuant to HRS § 667-51(a)(2).Because the circuit court's Order Granting Motion for Instructions did notfinally determine and, thus, end the proceedings for the sale of theforeclosed property, the circuit court's Order Granting Motion forInstructions is not appealable. See Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 157,
80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) ("A post-judgment order is an appealable final orderunder HRS § 641–1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothingfurther to be accomplished." (citing Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Cent. Pac.Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 937-38 (1986))).

On appeal, the Krakauers argue that the circuit court 
erred when it (1) held that Plaintiff/Counterclaim­
Defendant/Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, not in its individual or banking capacity, but solely as Trustee for SRMOF 2009-1 Trust (Wells Fargo) "did not need to prove standing 
as the real party in interest and that it could, therefore, 
judicially foreclose on the subject property" and (2) denied the "[Krakauers' Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)] 
Motion For Relief From Judgment; For Evidentiary Hearing; For Leave To File Responsive Pleading; And For Stay Pending Hearing On Rule 60(b) Motion" (Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude the
 Krakauers' appeal is without merit.
 
The Krakauers raise several arguments in their briefs 
on appeal that challenge the circuit court's grant of summary judgment.
3 The Krakauers, however, did not appeal the circuit 
court's June 5, 2014 Judgment granting summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure in favor of Wells Fargo. Instead, the Krakauers appealed the circuit court's Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief. Our review is therefore limited to the issue of whether the circuit court abused its discretion when it denied the Krakauers' Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief. See Cook v. Surety 
Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai
'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995) 
(holding that when a party appeals from a single order, "this court will only consider other orders which were preliminary rulings upon which the subject Order was predicated or were part of the series of orders which collectively led to that Order"); see also Riethbrock v. Lange, 128 Hawai
'i 1, 17, 282 P.3d 543,

 The Krakauers' opening brief argues that (1) the circuit court
erred when it held that there was "no genuine issue of material fact as to
whether [Wells Fargo] had standing to foreclose" and (2) the documents that
Wells Fargo used to support its "Motion for Summary Judgment as Against All
Defendants and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" filed March 11, 2014,
"failed to comply with HRCP Rule 56."

559 (2012) (upholding the holding in Cook regarding preliminary
 
rulings).
 
HRCP Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part: 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER.
 
. . . .
 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud, etc. On motion and upon such
terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a
party's legal representative from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (3) fraud
(whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic),
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;
(4) the judgment is void[.]
 
The Krakauers argued in their Rule 60(b) Motion for
 
Relief that the Judgment was obtained by fraud and was,
 
therefore, void. Specifically, their Rule 60(b) Motion for
 Relief contended that Wells Fargo did not have standing to seek
 foreclosure because "it fraudulently manufactured its Assignment
 of Mortgage . . . in contravention on [sic] the terms of Pooling
 and Servicing Agreement . . . to deceive [the Krakauers] and this
 Honorable Court as to the facts of the matter asserted."
 
This court has previously held that "borrowers do not 
have standing to challenge the validity of an assignment of [their] loans because they are not parties to the agreement and because noncompliance with a trust's governing document is irrelevant to the assignee's standing to foreclose." U.S. Bank 
Nat'l Ass'n v. Salvacion, 134 Hawai
'i 170, 175, 338 P.3d 1185, 
1190 (App. 2014). "Hawai 'i courts may recognize exceptions when 
a challenge would deem the assignment void, not voidable[;]" however, "non-compliance with the terms of a governing document does not render the assignment void[.]" Id. at 175-76, 338 P.3d 
at 1190-91. The Krakauers failed to demonstrate that the Judgment was void or that Wells Fargo committed fraud. The circuit court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying the Krakauers' Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief. See Beneficial 
Hawai
'i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai 'i 159, 164, 45 P.3d 359, 364 
(2002) ("The circuit court's disposition of an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion."). 
Therefore,
