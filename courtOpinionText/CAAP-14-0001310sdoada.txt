APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2012-338 (2-12-45174))
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By:  Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
Employer/Appellant State of Hawaii, University of
Hawai#i and Third-Party Administrator/Appellant Firms Claims
Services ( Appellants ) appeal from the October 22, 2014 Decision
and Order by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
(LIRAB) that was favorable to Claimant/Appellee Ray A. Tagama
(Tagama) as to his claim for workers' compensation benefits.#
On appeal, Appellants raised three points of error
contending the LIRAB erred:
(1) in failing to properly and fully recognize the
import of its Finding of Fact (
FOF) 31, which acknowledged
Tagama's specific knowledge of the compensable nature of his
bilateral knee condition in 2006, and by erroneously re-
characterizing the injury;
(2) in its reading and interpretation of the statutory
language in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 386-82 (2015 Repl.)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
HRS § 386-82 provides in relevant part:1
HRS §386-82.  Claim for compensation; limitation of time. 
The right to compensation under this chapter shall be barred
unless a written claim therefor is made to the director of labor
and industrial relations:
(1)Within two years after the date at which the effects
of the injury for which the employee is entitled to
compensation have become manifest; and
(2)Within five years after the date of the accident or
occurrence which caused the injury. 
2to conclude that the statute of limitations did not begin to run
until Tagama's last day of work; and
(3) in its legal analysis concluding in favor of
Tagama's claim based on the cumulative impact of his employment
on his knee condition, rather than the work injury claimed to
have occurred on January 9, 2012.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.
Appellants argue that the LIRAB misinterpreted the
statutory language of HRS §386-821 to erroneously conclude that
the statute of limitations began to run on Tagama's last day of
work, January 9, 2012.  Appellants contend instead that the
statute of limitations began to run when Tagama sought medical
treatment in November 2006.  In particular, Appellants point to
FOF 31 as establishing when Tagama understood the compensable
nature of his injury.
The "time period for notice or claim does not begin to
run until the claimant, as a reasonable [person], should
recognize the nature, seriousness and probable compensable
character of [an] injury or disease."  Demond v. Univ. of Hawaii ,
54 Haw. 98, 104, 503 P.2d 434, 438 (1972)(emphasis added)
(citation omitted).
The relevant and undisputed findings by the LIRAB which
relate to whether Tagama, as a reasonable person, "should haveNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3recognized the nature, seriousness and probable compensable
character" of his knee injury are as follows:
Prior Knee condition from 2004 to 2012
5.  In 2004, Claimant was involved in a non-industrial
fall from a bridge in which he injured his right knee.  X-
rays following the injury showed mild degenerative changes
in the right knee.  Claimant weighted 350 lbs. in 2004.   
6.  In 2006, Claimant experienced increased pain in
both knees.  At a November 22, 2006 visit with John Frauens,
M.D., an orthopedic specialist, Claimant was diagnosed with
osteoarthritis of the knees.  Dr. Frauens told Claimant to
lose weight and to expect the need for knee replacement
surgery in the future.  X-rays, performed on November 22,
2006, showed mild degenerative changes in both knees.  
7.  On April 7, 2008, Claimant's x-rays showed
moderate osteoarthritis in the right knee and mild
osteoarthritis in the left knee. 
8.  After a three-year hiatus, claimant returned to
see Dr. Frauens on November 2, 2009, for increased pain in
the knees.  Dr. Frauens administered steroid injections to
claimant's knees. 
9.  According to Mark Shaied, M.D., x-rays in November
2009 showed moderate arthritis that was considered
significant but not yet quite "bone-on-bone."
10.  On June 24, 2010, Claimant treated with Patrice
Tim Sing, M.D., an internist.  Dr. Tim Sing advised Claimant
to lose weight and to exercise
.  She said it was better to
do that than to stop work.
11.  On July 3, 2010, Andrea Snow, M.D., an
orthopedist, talked to Claimant about losing weight and
changing careers to one that would not require so much time
on his feet.  Dr. Snow felt that Claimant could decrease his
knee pain with a more sedentary job. 
12.  On August 12, 2010, Dr. Snow advised Claimant
that he was at that time too heavy and too young for knee
replacement surgery.  She administered steroid injections to
both knees. 
13.  On October 12, 2011, Claimant saw physician-
assistant, Michael Green, PA-C, for increased bilateral knee
pain secondary to the physical demands of his job.  Claimant
reported that his pain improved after a period of rest from
work. 
14.  From 2010 to 2012, Claimant engaged in part-time
concurrent employment at Pizza Hut, working 10-15 hours per
week.  His knee condition made it difficult for him to stand
at this job.  
Last Day of Work
15.  On January 9, 2012, Claimant was at work for
Employer preparing equipment and disposing trash.  After the
third load of trash, Claimant's knees buckled.  He
experienced significant pain and was unable to complete hisNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4shift.  Claimant did not return to work after January 9,
2012. 
. . . .
Claimant's Testimony at Trial
. . . .
31.  As early as 2006, Claimant felt that his bilateral knee
symptoms worsened with work but improved after rest.  Claimant
testified that he thought about filing a workers' compensation
claim in 2006, but did not do so because he was in school, his
bilateral knee problem was not that bad at the time, and he was
afraid a claim could affect his job.  Claimant further testified
that his pain symptoms from his bilateral knee condition increased
and worsened in 2010.  The Board credits Claimant's testimony.
(Emphases added.)
Tagama's pre-existing injury began in 2004 and was not
work-related.  In our view, the findings by the LIRAB do not
support a conclusion that Tagama should have reasonably
recognized "the nature, seriousness and probable compensable
character" of his knee injury in 2006.  The LIRAB's undisputed
findings include that, in 2006, Tagama was told to lose weight
and to expect the need for a knee replacement in the future, and
the LIRAB credited Tagama's testimony that although he thought
about filing a worker's compensation claim in 2006, his knee
problem was not that bad at the time.  There is no finding that
Tagama had to miss work in 2006 due to his knee condition, or
that any doctor suggested that Tagama limit or stop his work
activities.  He continued to work.
Given the undisputed findings by the LIRAB and
especially FOF 11, it appears that the earliest Tagama reasonably
should have recognized "the nature, seriousness and probable
compensable character" of his knee injury was on July 3, 2010,
when Dr. Andrea Snow talked to Tagama about changing careers to
decrease his knee pain.  Moreover, as set forth in FOF 31, the
LIRAB credited Tagama's testimony that "his pain symptoms from
his bilateral knee condition increased and worsened in 2010." 
See Flor v. Holguin , 94 Hawai #i 70, 9 P.3d 382 (2000)(holding
that the statute of limitations began to run when the claimant, a
dental hygienist, discovered that she had contracted hepatitis
C); Hayashi v. Scott Co. , 93 Hawai #i 8, 994 P.2d 1054 (2000);NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5Tomita v. Hotel Serv. Ctr., 2 Haw. App. 157, 159, 628 P.2d 205,
207 (1981).  Even assuming that the statute of limitations began
to run on July 3, 2010, Tagama timely filed his claim for
workers' compensation benefits on March 6, 2012.  Therefore,
Tagama's claim was not time barred.
Appellants also argue that the LIRAB's legal analysis
of Tagama's "work injury" is misplaced and erroneous. Appellants'
arguments are somewhat difficult to discern, but in their points
of error, Appellants contend the LIRAB should have only
determined whether the work event on January 9, 2012 aggravated,
accelerated or exacerbated Tagama's underlying knee condition. 
We do not agree.  In an order dated August 14, 2013, the LIRAB
determined that "[a]s the issue is presently phrased in the
Pretrial Order, Claimant is not precluded from arguing either a
discrete accident or cumulative trauma theory and Employer is not
precluded from raising applicable defenses thereto, including a
statute of limitations defense."  Appellants do not challenge
this order, and thus the LIRAB did not err in considering whether
Tagama's knee condition was aggravated or exacerbated by his work
activities beyond January 9, 2012.
A compensable injury requires a "nexus between the
employment and the injury."  Tate v. GTE Hawaiian Telephone Co. ,
77 Hawai
#i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 1246, 1249 (1994).  The unitary
test "considers whether there is a sufficient work connection to
bring the accident within the scope of the statute" and "requires
the finding of a causal connection between the injury and any
incidents or conditions of employment."  Id.  The unitary test
applies to cases involving the compensability of an injury
resulting from the aggravation of a pre-existing condition, as is
the case here.  See Akamine v. Hawaiian Packing & Crating Co. , 53
Haw. 406, 495 P.2d 1164 (1972).
The evidence is undisputed that Tagama had a pre-
existing osteoarthritis knee condition.  Tagama's work history
and work duties from 2000 to 2012 as groundskeeper involved
physical labor that kept him on his feet daily, and "[h]is work
duties involved frequent walking, bending, squatting, kneeling,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
6lifting, and other weight bearing activities."  Given the
statewide staff cutbacks, Tagama often worked short-handed,
sometimes for months at a time.  On January 9, 2012, while at
work, Tagama's knees buckled while preparing equipment and
disposing trash.  Tagama was unable to complete his shift and did
not return to work.
The evidence here supports the LIRAB's conclusion that
Tagama's work duties aggravated and accelerated his knee
condition.  Joseph DiCostanzo, M.D., an occupational medicine
physician, stated on August 6, 2012 that Tagama's "position as a
groundskeeper" had aggravated the underlying bilateral
osteoarthritis of his knee.  Also, evidence provided by Peter
Diamond, M.D. ( Dr. Diamond ), an orthopedic surgeon, showed
cumulative work from 2006 to 2012 "materially increased
[Tagama's] risk for development of knee arthritis and most likely
accelerated the rate of degeneration."  Dr. Diamond also opined
that "the cumulative performance of heavy labor over the years
permanently aggravated [Tagama's] underlying osteoarthritis."
The presumption that a claim is for a covered work
injury imposed by HRS § 386-85 (2015 Repl.) "imposes upon the
employer the burden of going forward with the evidence and the
burden of persuasion."  Akamine, 53 Haw. at 408, 495 P.2d at
1166.  The presumption is rebutted "only by substantial evidence
that [the injury] is unrelated to the employment."  Id. 
The LIRAB credited the medical opinions of Dr. Diamond
and Dr. DiCostanzo in finding that Tagama's work activities
permanently aggravated or accelerated Tagama's underlying
bilateral knee osteoarthritis.  On the other hand, it found that
Appellants' expert, Brian Mihara, M.D., an occupational medicine
physician, who opined that Tagama's injury was not work related,
did not specifically address whether Tagama's work activities
aggravated or accelerated his underlying osteoarthritis
condition.
We conclude that Appellants failed to overcome the
presumption that Tagama's bilateral knee osteoarthritic conditionNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
7was a covered work injury.  See Van Ness v. State, Dep't of
Educ., 131 Hawai #i 545, 558, 319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014).
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 22, 2014 Decision
and Order by the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board is
affirmed.
