 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-1 (Supp. 2003).

I. BACKGROUND
 
The Department of Human Services (DHS), a State agency
 
that receives and manages Medicaid funding to provide home and
 community-based services to disabled adults under the Social
 Security Act, 42 C.F.R. Part 441 Subpart G, contracted with
 Service Providers to provide Medicaid Waiver attendant and in-
home day care services to qualified disabled individuals.
2 The
 
DHS's contracts allowed Service Providers to hire subcontractors
 to provide the direct services to disabled individuals. Under
 the DHS contracts, Service Providers received payments directly
 from DHS, and Service Providers were responsible for paying the
 subcontractors.
 
Between 2004 and 2006, Service Providers obtained
 
workers' compensation insurance from Intervenor/Appellee/Appellee
 Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. (HEMIC) for
 
their employees, but did not obtain insurance coverage for their
 
subcontractors. On February 17, 2005, then-Director of
 
1 HRS § 386-1 provided, in pertinent part:
 
§386-1 Definitions. In this chapter, unless the
context otherwise requires:
 
. . . .
 
"Employment" means any service performed by an
individual for another person under any contract of hire or
apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, whether
lawfully or unlawfully entered into. It includes service of
 public officials, whether elected or under any appointment
or contract of hire express or implied.
 
"Employment" does not include the following service:
 
. . . .
 (6)	 Domestic, which includes attendant care, and day
care services authorized by the department of
human services under the Social Security Act, as
amended, performed by an individual in the
employ of a recipient of social service
payments[.]

 The facts included in this background are based primarily on the
LIRAB's Findings of Fact (FOFs). The facts recounted in this background are
undisputed on appeal unless otherwise indicated.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Respondent/Appellee/Appellee Department of Labor and Industrial
 
Relations (DLIR) Nelson B. Befitel issued a declaratory ruling in
 
In re Manawa Lea Health Services, Inc. (the Manawa Lea Decision),
 
concluding that an entity similar to Service Providers, which had
 
also used subcontractors to provide Medicaid Waiver services, did
 not fall within the domestic exemption under the then-existing
 HRS § 386-1. Following the Manawa Lea Decision, HEMIC sought
 unpaid workers' compensation insurance premiums from Service
 Providers for their subcontractors for the period of time between
 2004 and 2006.
 
On May 13, 2008, Service Providers petitioned DLIR for
 
a declaratory ruling establishing:
 
1.	 In the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, [Service Providers']
subcontractors who perform Medicaid Waiver Services
("Subcontractors") were independent contractors and
not employees of [Service Providers] in the
performance of those services; and
 
2.	 That in the years 2004, 2006 [sic] and 2006, the
Subcontractors who performed Medicaid Waiver Services
were excluded from "employment" under the then
existing "domestic" exemption of [HRS] § 386-1 when
they performed those services.
 
The Director of DLIR, Darwin L.D. Ching (Director), issued his
 
Declaratory Ruling on October 22, 2008 (Director's Declaratory
Ruling) on the issue of "whether individuals who were
 
subcontracted by [Service Providers] to perform Medicaid Waiver
 
services in 2004, 2005, and 2006 were excluded from 'employment'
 under [HRS] § 386-1(6), commonly called the 'domestic
 exception.'" The Director concluded:
 
[T]he domestic exception only covers services provided to a
recipient of social service payments where the recipient is:
(1) a person who receives social services; and (2) that
person also receives social service payments. As [Service
Providers] are not recipients of social services, services
provided by their workers are not covered by the domestic
exception.
 
Service Providers filed their appeal of the Director's
 
Declaratory Ruling to the LIRAB on November 10, 2008. The LIRAB
 
issued its D&O on November 7, 2014 affirming the Director's
 Declaratory Ruling. Service Providers appealed to this court on
 November 21, 2014.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Administrative Rulings
 
HRS § 91-14(g) (1993) provides:
 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdictionof the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,and substantial evidence on the whole record; or

See Tauese v. State, Dep't of Labor and Indus. Relations, 113 
Hawai'i 1, 25, 147 P.3d 785, 809 (2006). Conclusions of law fall 
within subsections (1), (2), and (4), and are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. Id. (citing Potter v. Hawai

873 P.2d 51, 59 (1993)). Findings of fact are reviewed under subsection (5) to determine if the agency was clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Tause, 113 Hawai

Inc., 84 Hawai 'i 390, 396, 935 P.2d 105, 111 (App. 1997) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Sato v. Tawata, 79 
Hawai'i 14, 17, 897 P.2d 941, 944 (1995)). 
Our construction of statutes is guided by the following
rules:
 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory-
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its
plain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the
task of statutory construction is our foremost
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself. Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists.

383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009)). 
"[W]hen, as in this case, an administrative agency is 
involved, we defer to the agency's interpretations of its rules 
unless deference would result in an absurd or unjust result, or be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose." Iida, 86 Hawai
'i at 396, 935 P.2d at 111

III. DISCUSSION
 
Service Providers contend they are covered by the
 
domestic exemption under the then-existing HRS § 386-1, and
 therefore do not have "employment" relationships with their
 subcontractors such that Service Providers would be required to
 comply with HRS chapter 386 (Workers' Compensation Law). Service
 
Providers argue that the LIRAB erred by misinterpreting the
 
domestic exemption when it concluded that since Service Providers
 did not receive Medicaid Waiver social services, they were not
 covered by the domestic exception in effect prior to 2007.

 On July 5, 2007, the Governor of Hawai' i approved Act 259, which
amended HRS § 386-1. 2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 259 at 831-41. Section 3 of 
Act 259 added a new statutory definition of "recipient of social servicepayments," and provides: 
(continued...)

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Service Providers argue that the LIRAB rested its erroneous
 
conclusion on its misinterpretation of the statute as ambiguous,
 and that the plain language of the statute is clear and
 sufficient to resolve the issue of whether the subcontractors for
 Service Providers fell within the meaning of the domestic
 exemption to HRS § 386-1. Service Providers argue that they were
 recipients of social service payments under the terms of their
 contracts with DHS, clearly within the meaning of the domestic
 exemption.
 
The Director, in his Declaratory Ruling, found that
 
3(...continued)
SECTION 3. Section 386-1, [HRS], is amended by adding
a new definition to be appropriately inserted and to read as
follows:
 
""Recipient of social service payments" includes:
(1)	 A person who is an eligible recipient of social
services such as attendant care and day care
services; and
(2)	 A corporation or private agency that contracts
directly with the [DHS] to provide attendant
care and day care authorized under the Social
Security Act, as amended."
 
2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 259, § 3 at 831-32. Section 7 of Act 259 also
 amended the domestic exemption:
 
SECTION 7. Section 386-1, [HRS], is amended by
amending the definition of "employment" to read as follows:
 
. . . .
 
(6)	 Domestic, [which includes attendant care, and
day care services authorized by the department
of human services under the Social Security Act,
as amended,] in-home and community-based
services for persons with developmental
disabilities and mental retardation under the
 medicaid home and community-based services
program pursuant to title 42 Code of Federal
Regulations sections 440.180 and 441.300, and
title 42 Code of Federal Regulations, part 434,
subpart A, as amended, and identified as chore,
personal assistance and habilitation,
residential habilitation, supported employment,
respite, and skilled nursing services, as the
terms are defined by the department of human
services, performed by an individual [in the
employ of] whose services are contracted by a
recipient of social service payments[;] and who
voluntarily agrees in writing to be an
independent contractor of the recipient of
social service payments[.]
 
2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 259, § 7 at 836.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"whether 'recipients of social service payments' includes anyone
 
receiving social service payments or just recipients of social
 services who also receive such payments is not plain and
 obvious." The Director concluded that the domestic exemption
 "covers services provided to a recipient of social service
 payments where the recipient is: (1) a person who receives social
 services; and (2) that person also receives social service
 payments." The LIRAB upheld the Director's determination. In
 its FOFs, the LIRAB stated:
 
28. Service Providers and the Director disagreed on
what "recipient of social service payments" meant during the
period 2004 to 2006. Service Providers contended that
"recipient of social service payments" referred to entities
like them that received social service payments from DHS.
The Director interpreted the term "recipient of social
service payments" to be limited or restricted to individuals
who were recipients of social services and who also received
social service payments. 
29. The divergent interpretations show that there was
doubt or ambiguity in the meaning of "recipient of social
service payments" in HRS § 386-1(6) prior to 2007.
 
We hold that the Director's conclusion was plainly 
erroneous, and the LIRAB erred in adopting the Director's 
conclusion. See Iida, 86 Hawai 'i at 396, 935 P.2d at 111 ("[W]e 
defer to the agency's interpretations of its rules unless deference would result in an absurd or unjust result, or be 'plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose.'"). 
The Director's conclusion that a person must receive 
social services in order to qualify for the domestic exemption under HRS § 386-1 is simply not supported by any conceivable reading of the statute. There is no "doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression" in the domestic exemption. See First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, 126 
Hawai
'i at 414, 271 P.3d at 1173 (quoting Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 
390, 219 P.3d at 1177). Statutory language is not ambiguous merely because parties present differing constructions or interpretations to the court. See In re Krafft-Murphy Co., Inc., 
82 A.3d 696, 702 (Del. 2013) (adopting the lower court's observation that "[t]he fact that the parties disagree about the meaning of the statute does not create ambiguity"); Farm Bureau 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mut. Ins. Co. of Idaho v. Eisenman, 286 P.3d 185, 188 (Idaho
 
2012) ("[S]tatutory language is not ambiguous 'merely because the
 parties present differing interpretations to the court.'")
 (citation omitted); In re Commitment of West, 800 N.W.2d 929, 942
 (Wis. 2011) ("The fact that the parties advance different
 interpretations of a statute does not, alone, make the statute
 ambiguous."). Therefore, this court will not defer to the
 LIRAB's interpretation of the domestic exemption.
 
DLIR argues that the legislative history of the statute
 
indicates a legislative intent that conflicts with a plain
 reading of the statute, thus creating an ambiguity in the
 statutory language. DLIR looks to the purpose clause of Act 110,
 1978 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 110, § 1 at 190, and a standing
 committee report, S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 314-78, in 1978 Senate
 Journal, at 898, to suggest that the "domestic exemption was
 created for recipients of social services[.]" (Emphasis omitted.) 
While DLIR's conclusion about the purpose of the domestic
 exemption may be true, nothing in the legislative history
 suggests that the final language of the statute was meant to
 encompass only those individual recipients of social services who
 hire other individuals for personal domestic care within the
 meaning of the domestic exemption. Stated another way, the
 legislative history does not suggest that the statute is supposed
 to be read, or even that the statute could reasonably be read, to
 apply only to recipients of social services who also receive such
 payments.
 
Because we hold that the language of the statute is 
plain and unambiguous, "our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning." See First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, 126 
Hawai
'i at 414, 271 P.3d at 1173 (quoting Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i at 
390, 219 P.3d at 1177). HRS § 386-1, for the period of time in question, exempts from coverage under the Workers' Compensation Law those who provide domestic services performed by an individual who is employed by an entity that receives social service payments. 
DHS contracted with Service Providers to provide
 
Medicaid Waiver services to elderly and disabled adults. Under
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the contracts, DHS made social service payments to Service
 
Providers in exchange for their Medicaid Waiver services. Service
 Providers were permitted to hire subcontractors to provide the
 Medicaid Waiver services to eligible individuals. Service
 Providers' relationship to their subcontractors were thus
 exempted from the meaning of "employment" under HRS § 386-1
 because the subcontractors hired by Service Providers were
 providing domestic and day care services, and Service Providers
 were receiving payments for the social services provided to the
 eligible individuals. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the Decision and Order issued by the Labor
 
and Industrial Relations Appeals Board on November 7, 2014 is
 vacated and this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with
 this Opinion.
