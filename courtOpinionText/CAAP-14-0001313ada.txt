OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
 
Following the 2012 General Election, Plaintiffs-
Appellants Green Party of Hawaii, Karen M. Holt, Elizabeth M. 
Ruze, Michael Kratzke, Moani Keala Akaka, Kim Duffet, Mary Jo Dennison, and Maka
'ala Ka 'aumoana (collectively, Appellants) filed 
suit against Defendants Scott Nago, Chief Election Officer (Nago) 
and the State of Hawai 'i (State) (together, Appellees), alleging 
that: three of the methodologies and procedures used by the 
State in conjunction with the 2012 General Election were "rules" within the meaning of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 91;  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
these purported rules were not promulgated in compliance with HRS
 
Chapter 91; and therefore, they should be declared invalid and
 subject to a permanent injunction. The Circuit Court of the
 Second Circuit (Circuit Court)
1
 rejected Appellants' arguments
and entered Judgment in favor of Nago and the State.
 
Appellants appeal from the Circuit Court's October 24,
 
2014 Final Judgment and challenge the Circuit Court's September
 26, 2014 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order: 
(1)
 
Granting Defendants Scott Nago, Chief Election Officer, and the
 State of Hawaii's Motion for Summary Judgment; and (2) Denying
 Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment" (FOF/COL and Order).
 
We affirm.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arose out of the 2012 General Election. It
 
is undisputed that mistakes were made. There was a shortage of
 
paper ballots in English at a number of precincts across the
 State. In addition, when reserve ballots were sent out to the
 polling places, there was a mix up of the ballots sent to two
 locations; this resulted in 57 voters casting votes on incorrect
 ballots. It appears, however, that: all voters in line at the
 close of voting received the opportunity to vote; if English
 language paper ballots were not immediately available at a
 particular polling place, voters could vote at an electronic
 voting machine or on an alternative language paper ballot; every
 voter who signed a precinct book cast a ballot; every voter who
 voted on the wrong paper ballot had his or her vote counted in
 every race in which he or she was entitled to vote; and, none of
 the races that could have been impacted by the ballot mix-up were
 close enough to have been affected. Nevertheless, as widely
 acknowledged, Appellees' execution of the 2012 General Election
 fell short of the electorate's reasonable expectations.
 
Appellants filed a Complaint on December 7, 2012,
 
alleging that Appellees engaged in unlawful rule-making. 
Appellants demanded declaratory and injunctive relief as follows:
 
1
 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
2
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) the use of the methodology used to determine the number
of ballots to be printed in a federal and/or state election,
(2) the procedures by which a precinct requests additional
paper or marksense ballots when the precinct runs out of
ballots and receives additional blank paper or marksense
ballots, and (3) the procedure used to rectify the situation
when a voter votes a ballot that contains some races to
 which the voter is not entitled to vote, to be invalid
[rules], temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive
relief prohibiting [Appellees] from acting pursuant to such
invalid rules, and an award of reasonable attorney's fees
and costs.
 
Appellants filed "Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary
 
Judgment" on May 30, 2014. Appellees filed "Defendants Scott
 
Nago and State of Hawaii's Motion for Summary Judgment"
 (Appellees' MSJ) on June 9, 2014. The hearing on both motions
 
was held on July 18, 2014. The Circuit Court entered its FOF/COL
 
and Order on September 26, 2014.
 
Concerning the methodology used to determine the number
 
of blank ballots printed for the 2012 General Election, the
 Circuit Court's undisputed findings include:
 
Ballot Delivery
 
6. The Chief Election officer is required to deliver
a sufficient number of ballots to each of the precincts
before the polls open on Election Day. Haw. Rev. Stat. §§
11-119, 11-120; 
Haw. Admin. R. §§ 3-172-72, 3-172-73, 3-172­
74.
 
7. Prior to the 2012 General Election, the model for
ordering polling place ballots was based on calculating 85%
of the amount of registered voters in the precinct. In
 other words, if there were 100 registered voters in a
precinct, 85 ballots would be assigned to the polling place
for Election Day voters.
 
8. Voter turnout in comparable elections can be used
as a basis to increase or decrease the ballot order as
 necessary (i.e. depending on previous elections 85% can be
increased to 90% or reduced to 80%). This is more difficult
 to do in an election following a reapportionment. Thus, in
2012, a direct correlation in the number of ballots needed
for the current precincts and the precincts that existed for
the 2010 General Election and the 2008 General Election
 (which was the last presidential election) could not be made
because the recently completed reapportionment/redistricting
process changed the district boundaries.
 
9. Polling place voter turnout has historically
ranged from 22.6% to 40.6% of registered voters, depending
on the year and whether it was a primary election, general
election, presidential election, or gubernatorial election
and as a result, this calculation (85% of registered voters
in a precinct) resulted in essentially twice as many ballots
ordered as polling place voters.
 
3
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
10. Percentages are based on the summary report for
elections from 2008 to 2010, under the heading "precinct
turnout" which refers to the percentage of registered voters
who voted at the polls. The low was 22.6% for the 2008
 Primary Election and the high was that same year in the 2008
General Election at 40.6%. The 2010 Primary Election was
23.8% and the General Election was 32.2%.
 
11. In the past, the absentee mail ballots ordered
were generally equal to 35% of the polling place ballots,
absentee walk ballots ordered were 20% of the polling place
ballots and reserve ballots were equal to 6% of the polling
place ballot order, (i.e., Amount of Polling Place Ballots =
Registered Voter Count x 85%; Amount of Absentee Mail
Ballots = Amount of Polling Place Ballots x 35%; Amount of
Absentee Walk Ballots = Amount of Polling Place Ballots x
20%; and Amount of Reserve Ballots = Amount of Polling Place
Ballots x 6%).
 
12. Absentee walk ballots are ballots that are cast
 
by voters who vote prior to Election Day at a polling place
outside of their precinct that is set up for early voting.
 
13. Generally, the end result is a ballot order of
137 ballots for every 100 registered voters or, in other
words, a ballot order of 137% of the voter registration
count for a precinct.
 
14. In addition, the ballot order calculation can be
supplemented by a review of the absentee ballot utilization
to determine whether reserve ballots should be deployed with
the polling place ballots prior to the opening of polls.
 
. . . .
 
20. Additional ballots may also be printed by the
vendor on Election Day.
 
. . . . 
Ballot Delivery for the 2012 General Election
 
22. The 2012 General Election was the first General
 
Election following the reapportionment and redistricting of
the precincts in 2011.
 
23. As a result of reapportionment and redistricting,
precinct/district boundaries changed and there was no prior
General Election to use as a starting point in calculating
the number of ballots needed in each of the post-
reapportionment and redistricting precincts.
 
24. Accordingly, for the 2012 General Election, the
Office of Elections modified the ballot order calculation by
utilizing the 2012 Primary Election voter turnout as the
base and multiplied the numbers by 125%. Due to concerns
 regarding the adequacy of 6% reserve ballots, that
percentage was increased to 25%.
 
25. The 2012 General Election ballot order for the
 
polling places was 32.4% of the registered voters; absentee
mail ballots were calculated at 29.1%; absentee walk was
5.8%; and the number of reserve ballots was increased to
25.1%.
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
26. During the 2012 General Election, certain polling
places experienced a shortage of paper ballots in English.
 
27. While certain polling places experienced a
shortage of paper ballots in English during the 2012 General
Election, voters who went to those polling places, could
vote on a minority language ballot or by using an electronic
voting machine.
 
28. During the 2012 General Election, no voter[] who
was in line at a polling place prior to 6:00 p.m. and was
eligible to vote, was turned away and not allowed to vote.
 
Concerning the procedures used by the precincts to
 
determine to request additional ballots on election day, the
 
Circuit Court's undisputed findings include:
 
40. On Election Day, precinct workers monitor the
supply of paper ballots at the polling place and when it
appears that the supply of ballots is running low, a
precinct worker calls the counting center at the State
Capitol and asks that reserve ballots for that precinct be
delivered.
 
Concerning the procedures used to rectify the situation
 
when a voter casts a ballot that contains some races in which the
 
voter is not entitled to vote, the Circuit Court's undisputed
 findings include:
 
Counting Votes on Wrong Ballots
 
42. The vote counting equipment at each of the polling
places is electronically programmed to read only the paper
ballots for races for which voters who reside in that
 precinct are entitled to vote.
 
43. The precinct counters at each of the polling
places will reject paper ballots that include election
contests that do not pertain to that precinct and will
reject those ballots.
 
44. All rejected ballots are deposited into a sealed
emergency ballot bin and are delivered to the counting
center where the votes on those ballots are manually counted
after the polls close. 
45. In counting the votes cast on a wrong ballot, all
of the votes cast in races for which the voters in that
 precinct are entitled to vote are counted and all of the
votes cast in races for which voters in that precinct are
not entitled to vote are not counted.
 
46. Where voters have mistakenly voted on the wrong
ballot or some other irregularity in the election hasoccurred, any candidate, any qualified, directly interestedpolitical party, or any 30 voters of an election districtmay file an election contest in the [Hawai' i Supreme Court
under HRS § 11-172 (2009 Repl.)]. 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Based on these and other FOFs, the Circuit Court
 
concluded, inter alia, that "the challenged procedures and
 
methodologies are regulations concerning only the internal
 management of an agency," there was no evidence that the
 challenged procedures and methodologies "affected the private
 rights of, and procedures available to, the public," and Nago and
 the State were entitled to summary judgment on Appellants' claims
 of illegal rule-making. The Circuit Court entered the Final
 Judgment on October 24, 2014.
II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
On appeal, Appellants contend that the Circuit Court
 
erred in:
 
(1) concluding that the methodology used to determine
 
the number of blank ballots to be printed for an election was not
 a rule within the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4) (2012) and therefore
 was not required to be adopted pursuant to HRS § 91-3 (2012); 
(2) concluding that the procedures used by a precinct
 
to request additional ballots when the precinct runs out of
 ballots and receives additional ballots were not rules within the
 meaning of HRS § 91-1(4) and therefore were not required to be
 adopted pursuant to HRS § 91-3; 
(3) concluding that the procedures used to rectify the
 
situation when a voter casts a ballot that contains some races in
 which the voter is not entitled to vote were not rules within the
 meaning of HRS § 91-1(4) and therefore were not required to be
 adopted pursuant to HRS § 91-3; and
 
(4) considering Appellants' decision to not file a
 
petition pursuant to HRS § 91-6 (2012) to be a factor in
 determining the validity of rules or their promulgation in a
 claim brought under HRS § 91-7 (2012).
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo." Ka Pa
'akai O Ka 'Aina v. Land Use Comm'n, 94 
Hawai'i 31, 41, 7 P.3d 1068, 1078 (2000) (citations and internal 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai 'i 
152, 160, 977 P.2d 160, 168-69 (1999). 
"A COL is not binding upon an appellate court and is 
freely reviewable for its correctness. [The appellate] court 
ordinarily reviews COLs under the right/wrong standard." Chun v. 
Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys., 106 Hawai 'i 416, 430, 106 
P.3d 339, 353 (2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai
'i 445, 
453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 (2004)). 
On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is
reviewed de novo. See State ex rel. Anzai v. City and Cnty.
of Honolulu, 99 Hawai' i 508, [515], 57 P.3d 433, [440]
(2002); Bitney v. Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai' i 243,
250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 (2001). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, we must view all of the evidence and inferences
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion.

IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Election Methodologies and Procedures
 
Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erroneously 
concluded that the challenged election methodologies and 
procedures were not "rules" within the meaning of the Hawai 'i 
Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), i.e., HRS chapter 91.
"A state agency must conform to the requirements of
 
HAPA when acting in a rule-making capacity." Rose v. Oba, 68
 
Haw. 422, 425, 717 P.2d 1029, 1031 (1986). "Rules not
 promulgated in accordance with the HAPA rule-making requirements
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
are invalid and unenforceable." Id. (citing Burk v. Sunn, 68
 
Haw. 80, 83, 705 P.2d 17, 20-21 (1985)). "Rule" is broadly
 
defined by HRS § 91-1(4) as meaning:
 
each agency statement of general or particular applicability
and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes
law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or
practice requirements of any agency. The term does not
 include regulations concerning only the internal management
of an agency and not affecting private rights of or
procedures available to the public, nor does the term
include declaratory rulings issued pursuant to [§] 91-8, nor
intra-agency memoranda.
 
A number of Hawai 'i appellate court decisions have 
examined what constitutes a HAPA rule. Some cases have focused 
primarily on the first part of HRS § 91-1(4), i.e., whether the agency has made a "statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency." Others have focused additionally or primarily on the second part of HRS § 91­1(4), i.e., the "internal management" exception. Although none of these cases involved agency actions quite like the ones at issue in this case, these cases inform our decision here. 
In Aguiar v. Haw. Hous. Auth., 55 Haw. 478, 479-81, 522
 
P.2d 1255, 1257-58 (1974), the supreme court considered whether
 the Hawaii Housing Authority's (HHA's) written policies setting
 
maximum income limits for continued tenancy in public housing and
 
rent schedules, which were set forth in amendments to HHA's
 "Master Management Resolution," were rules within the meaning of
 HAPA, subject to HAPA's rule-making requirements. HHA argued
 that the income limits and rents were not "'agency statement(s)
 of general or particular applicability and future effect.'" Id.
 
at 485, 522 P.2d at 1260. First noting that HHA did not
 seriously challenge the "future effect" of the policies, the
 supreme court stated "it is clear that agency statements of
 'general' applicability include those which delineate the future
 rights of the entire class of unnamed individuals with the
 agency's jurisdiction" and concluded that the "generality of
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
effect" requirement was satisfied. Id. at 485-86, 522 P.2d at
 
1261 (citations omitted).2 The supreme court likewise rejected
 
HHA's contention that the Master Management Resolution did not
 
"'implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy' within the
 meaning of HRS § 91-1(4)" because, although HHA had limited
 discretion due to federal mandates, HHA retained the important
 function of assessing parts of the rent formulation, which
 "obviously affect[ed]" the rights of low-income tenants. Id. at
 
486-87, 522 P.2d at 1261. Accordingly, the supreme court held
 that amendments to the Master Management Resolution "constitute
 'agency statement(s) . . . that implement law or policy" within
 the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4), are subject to the rule-making
 obligations of HAPA, and, ultimately, could not be applied to
 increase rents. Id. at 486-88, 493, 522 P.2d at 1261-62, 1265.
3
 
In Shoreline Transp., Inc. v. Robert's Tours & Transp.,
 
Inc., 70 Haw. 585, 779 P.2d 868 (1989), the supreme court was
 principally called upon to distinguish between the rule-making
 and adjudicatory functions of administrative agencies. In doing
 so, the supreme court emphasized that "[r]ulemaking is the
 process by which an agency lays down new prescriptions to govern
 the future conduct of those subject to its authority [and] . . .
 is essentially legislative in nature, not only because it
 operates in the future, but also because it is concerned largely
 with considerations of policy." Id. at 591, 779 P.2d at 872
 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The supreme
 court again examined this distinction, and the characteristics of
 
2
 In a footnote, the supreme court explained that, notwithstanding
HAPA's inclusion of the words "or particular," a "key characteristic of rule
making as distinguished from adjudication is the former's generality of
effect." Aguiar, 55 Haw. at 485 n.13, 522 P.2d at 1261 n.13.
 
3
 The supreme court also dispatched HHA's argument that the
"internal management" exception applied, noting that the exception only
applied if the regulation concerns internal management and does not affect
"private rights of the public" and observing that the "amendments 'affected'
in both a practical and a legal sense the 'private rights'" of current tenants
and prospective tenants of the low-income housing. Aguiar, 55 Haw. at 488-90,
 
522 P.2d at 1262-63.
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
rule-making in In re Hawaiian Elec., Inc., 81 Hawai 'i 459, 918 
P.2d 561 (1996), noting that it is "generally accepted that the 
distinguishing characteristic of rule-making is the generality of effect of the agency decision." Id. at 466, 918 P.2d at 568 
(citations omitted). The supreme court again emphasized that "[r]ule-making is an agency action governing the future conduct either of groups of persons or of a single individual; it is essentially legislative in nature, not only because it operates in the future, but also because it is concerned largely with considerations of policy." Id. Although the following 
observation was made in reference to adjudicatory matters, it appears relevant to other functions within an administrative agency's purview: 
[P]roblems may arise in a case which the administrative
agency could not reasonably foresee, problems which must be
resolved despite the absence of a general rule. Or the
 agency may not have had sufficient experience with a
particular problem to warrant rigidifying its tentative
judgment into a hard and fast rule. Or the problem may be
so specialized and varying in nature as to be impossible of
capture within the boundaries of a general rule. In those
 situations, the agency must retain the power to deal with
the problems on a case-by-case basis if the administrative
process is to be effective. There is thus a very definite
place for the case-by-case evolution of statutory standards.
 
Id. at 468, 918 P.2d at 570 (quoting Security and Exch. Comm'n v.
 
Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 202-03 (1947)).
 
In Hawaii Prince Hotel Waikiki Corp. v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu [(City)], 89 Hawai 'i 381, 974 P.2d 21 (1999), the 
supreme court was called upon to decide whether the unwritten methodology adopted by the City's appraiser to determine "imparted value" of golf courses was a rule within the meaning of HAPA. The City appraiser explained that he had "standards 'in his head'" which he used because, after several adverse rulings by the tax appeals court, he had stopped using the City's written guidelines. Id. at 391, 974 P.2d at 31. In addition to 
determining that the methodology was arbitrary and resulted in a lack of uniformity and inequality (id. at 392, 972 P.2d at 32), the supreme court concluded that "the City appraiser's 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
methodology . . . was clearly a 'rule' within the meaning of HRS
 
§ 91-1(4)" because the methodology was "based on his
 interpretation of the factors" in the applicable law and because
 of the future effect of the methodology on the assessments of all
 golf course owners. Id. at 393, 974 P.2d at 33. Accordingly,
 
the supreme court ordered the City to "promulgate a rule defining
 a methodology for ascertaining imparted value and to reassess the
 subject property accordingly." Id. 
In Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, the supreme court concluded 
that the City Department of Planning and Permitting's (DPP's) 
undocumented "practice" of publicly disclosing engineering 
reports only after they had been deemed acceptable constituted improper rule-making because the practice, in effect, amended the rule requiring disclosure and "affects the procedures available to the public and implements, interprets, or prescribes policy or describes the procedure or practice requirements of DPP." Nuuanu 
Valley Ass'n, 119 Hawai
'i at 99-100, 194 P.3d at 540-41 (citing 
HRS § 91-1(4); format altered). 
More recently, both the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) and the supreme court rejected the argument that the State 
Board of Land and Natural Resources's (BLNR's) methodology for 
determining the valuation of damages to natural resources 
constituted a "rule" within the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4). See 
Pila'a 400, LLC v. Bd. of Land & Natural Resources, 132 Hawai 'i 
247, 320 P.3d 912 (2014). The supreme court noted that HRS § 183C-3 authorized, but did not require, the BLNR and the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) to adopt rules 
and establish and enforce land use regulations. Id. at 264, 320 
P.3d at 929. The supreme court emphasized that the statute 
contained only a "general mandate" for rule-making, which was complied with through the promulgation of Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) chapter 13-5, and that there was no specific 
statutory requirement mandating rules for valuing damage to 
marine resources. Id. at 265, 320 P.3d at 930. Further, the 
supreme court opined that the circumstances were not appropriate 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for rule-making, quoting, inter alia, the language from Chenery
 
and In re Hawaiian Elec., discussed herein above. Id. at 265-66,
 
320 P.2d at 930-31. The court revisited the nature of rule-
making, noting "[i]n the most general terms, the purpose of rule-
making is to govern the future conduct of groups and individuals"
 and concluding that "[s]etting a general standard in this
 situation would be impractical to define by a general rule
 because [it] was an 'unforeseen situation' and 'so specialized
 and varying in nature so as to be impossible of capture within
 the boundaries of a general rule.'" Id. at 266, 320 P.3d at 931
 
(citations omitted). Quoting the ICA, the supreme court
 concluded that the agency's task was "a complex undertaking
 involving numerous and variable components, often unique to a
 particular situation [rendering] a single formulaic methodology 
. . . impracticable." Id. 
The supreme court in Pila
'a 400 also distinguished the 
circumstances of that case from the City appraiser's unwritten methodology in Hawaii Prince, explaining that the City appraiser "routinely calculated imparted value" and thus "the appraiser's future use of the imparted value methodology was clearly foreseeable" whereas the natural resource damage was unique. Id. 
at 266-67, 320 P.3d at 931-32. 
In other cases, the Hawai
'i appellate courts have 
implicitly or explicitly assumed that the first part of the HRS § 91-1(4) definitional requirements has been satisfied and turned directly to the "internal management" exception. In one such case, Doe v. Chang, 58 Haw. 94, 564 P.2d 1271 (1977), the supreme court considered whether a manual of instruction to Department of Social Service and Housing (DSSH) personnel concerning welfare 
fraud investigations was a rule. Although not discussed, the 
subject manual clearly included written statements of future effect that implemented or interpreted law or policy. Id. 
Applying the second part of HRS § 91-1(4), the supreme court noted that "the adoption by DSSH of rules having the force and effect of law, to govern investigations, is not mandated by HRS 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 346-14(9) if the operating requirements of the department are
 
satisfied by regulations concerning only its internal management
  
and not affecting private rights of or procedures available to
 the public." Id. at 96, 564 P.2d at 1273 (emphasis added). The
 
supreme court then held:
 
The manual of instructions in issue here falls into
 
the described class of regulations. The only persons
purporting to be instructed or ordered thereby are the
personnel of the department. The manual does not define the
 circumstances under which welfare recipients, or others not
members of the department personnel, shall be granted or
denied benefits. It does not command the public to do
anything, prohibit the public from doing anything or declare
the rights of the public in any respect. It does not make
 any procedures available to the public. We find it
 difficult to hypothesize a stronger example of the internal
regulation contemplated by HRS § 91-1(4).
Id. 
In Holdman v. Olim, 59 Haw. 346, 581 P.2d 1164 (1978),
 
the supreme court "assume[d], without deciding, that the
 
directive under which [the] appellant was denied entry to the
 prison so mandated standards of dress and limited the discretion
 of the prison staff as to conform to the inclusive definition of
 a 'rule'." Id. at 355, 581 P.2d at 1170. Turning to the second
 
part of HRS § 91-1(4), the court observed, "[w]hat constitutes
 matters of internal management is not clearly spelled out in HAPA
 itself or its legislative history." Id. As referenced in
 
Holdman, the legislative history indicates: 
[The House Standing Committee] consider[ed] matters relating
to the operation and management of state and county penal,
correctional, welfare, educational, public health and mental
health institutions, operation of the National Guard, the
custodial management of the property of the state or county
or of any agency primarily a matter of "internal management"
as used in this definition.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 8, in 1961 House Journal, at 656. 
Accordingly, the supreme court held, "[r]egulation of the access
 of individuals to a public facility under the custody of an
 agency, at least where imposed for the security of the
 facility . . . concerns the internal management of the agency."
 Holdman, 59 Haw. at 355, 581 P.2d at 1170. Similarly, in Emma Ah
 Ho v. Cobb, 62 Haw. 546, 617 P.2d 1208 (1980), the supreme court
 
13
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
held that a contract between a private entity and BLNR was not a
 
"rule" because it "concerns only the internal management of the
 Board and does not affect the private rights of or procedures
 available to the public. . . . The Agreement only sets forth the
 contractual rights and obligations of [the private party] and the
 Board." Id. at 551-52, 617 P.2d at 1212.

Another series of "internal management" cases involved
 
guidelines targeted at the conduct of police officers. State v.
 
Fedak, 9 Haw. App. 98, 825 P.2d 1068 (1992), involved a
 regulation by the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) establishing
 
sobriety roadblock procedures. The ICA held that the regulation
 
was an internal HPD regulation based in part on Massachusetts
 case law noting that such guidelines "are directed solely toward
 troopers" and "do not purport directly to regulate public
 conduct." Fedak, 9 Haw. App. at 100-01, 825 P.2d at 1070
 
(citations omitted). This court concluded that, "although HPD
 sobriety roadblocks unquestionably impinge on a driver's freedom
 of movement, [the regulation's] procedures are aimed at
 prescribing and controlling the police officer's activities in
 order to minimize the intrusion on the driver's rights." Id. at
 
101, 825 P.2d at 1070. Similarly, in In Interest of Doe, 9 Haw.
 App. 406, 412, 844 P.2d 679, 682-83 (1992), this court held:
 
[T]he field sobriety testing procedures established by the
[Hawaii County Police Department(HCPD)] were instructional
in nature directed only to the HCPD officers. The
 procedures instructed the officers how to administer field
sobriety tests to drivers reasonably believed to have been
[driving under the influence], after they were properly
stopped and ordered out of their cars. Also, although field
sobriety tests intrude on drivers' rights as do sobriety
roadblocks, HCPD's field sobriety testing procedures are
aimed at assuring the proper and correct methods of
administering the tests to drivers.

 The supreme court also referenced the reasoning found in federal
Administrative Procedure Act contract cases, including that "the government
must be free from vexatious restraints which interfere with the manner in
 which it may dispatch its own internal affairs," "the practical necessity" of
the exception, and the unreasonableness, burden and expense that would be
associated with requiring rule-making procedures for every government
contract. Ho, 62 Haw. at 552-53, 617 P.2d at 1213 (citations omitted).
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Consequently, those testing procedures concern
only the "internal management" of the HCPD and do not
affect the "private rights of or procedures available
to the public" within the meaning of HAPA.
 
In State v. Claunch, 111 Hawai 'i 59, 137 P.3d 373 (App. 
2006), while taking into consideration the Legislature's response 
5
to Fedak,  this court held that the Kauai Police Department's
regulations establishing authority and procedures at sobriety checkpoints, like the regulations in Fedak, only concerned the internal management of the agency and did not affect the private rights of or procedures available to the public. Claunch, 111 
Hawai
'i at 66, 137 P.3d at 380.6 
With that foundation, we turn to Appellants'
 
allegations of illegal rule-making.
1. Blank Ballots Printing
 
Appellants argue that the methodology used to determine
 
the number of blank ballots to be printed for an election
 constituted a "rule" within the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4) and
 seek, inter alia, a declaration invalidating the use of the
 methodology used to determine the number of ballots to be ordered
 for the 2012 General Election. The challenged methodology is set
 forth in the Circuit Court's FOFs, in particular FOFs 23-25. In
 short, an employee in the Office of Elections ordered the 2012
 General Election ballots by using the 2012 Primary Election voter
 turnout as the base and multiplying that number by 125%, plus
 
5 In addition to holding that the HPD guidelines establishing
sobriety road block procedures were not "rules" withing the meaning of HRS
§91-1(4), Fedak held that, in that case, the State had not proven that the
police officer had authority to change the location of the road block and,
therefore, the defendant's seizure was illegal. Fedak, 9 Haw. App. at 103-04,
 
825 P.2d at 1071-72.
 
6
 Guidelines and regulations targeted toward personnel have been
consistently deemed not "rules" within the meaning of § HRS 91-1(4). See,
e.g., Rose, 68 Haw. at 427, 717 P.2d at 1032 (finding that the bylaws of a
hospital governing corrective action against a doctor concern only the
internal management and operation of the hospital and do not affect the
private rights of or procedures available to the public); Waugh v. Univ. of
Haw., 63 Haw. 117, 131 621 P.2d 957, 968 (1980) (holding that the plaintiff's
suggested procedures would affect only the staff and faculty of the university
and not the private rights of or procedures available to the public); Doe v.
Chang, 58 Haw. at 96, 564 P.2d at 1273 (discussed above).

ordered an additional 25% in reserve ballots. As explained in
 
FOFs 7-20, this methodology differed from prior elections, at
 least in part due to an intervening reapportionment/redistricting
 process. Appellants have colorfully described this unwritten
 methodology as a "middle-level political appointee deciding the
 methodology for the number of blank ballots to be ordered in a
 room by herself." The State more specifically described this
 methodology in its answers to interrogatories, which Appellants
 submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment,
 including the following excerpts:
 
Former Office of Elections' Ballot Operations Section
Head, Lori Tomczyk, determined the formula to use to
calculate the number of ballots printed in the primary and
general elections (ballot order) of 2012. Based upon her
experience in preparing the ballot orders in prior
elections, Ms. Tomczyk modified prior ballot methodologies.
The calculations were subject to further refinement up to
and including Election Day, depending upon external
circumstances, including, among other things, the number of
absentee ballots and feedback from the county clerks.
 
The State is unaware of any specific document involved
in the determination process of the ballot ordering process
for the 2012 primary and general elections.
 
. . . .
 
For the ballot order for the 2012 Primary Election,
the former Ballot Operations Section Head multiplied the
precinct registered voter count by 80%, on the assumption
(based on past primary elections) that 80% of the registered
voters would actually vote in the election, or that such an
amount would provide an adequate buffer over historical
voter turnouts. As voters can vote by absentee mail,
absentee walk, and at the polling place on Election Day, Ms.
Tomczyk predicted how many of these populations would vote
in each setting. Ms. Tomczyk assumed that 45% of the
expected voters would vote at the polling places, 30% by
absentee mail, and the remaining 25% would vote by absentee
walk.
 
According to the actual ballot order for the 2012
Primary Election, ballots for the polling place were
calculated as 37.3% of the registered voters (Amount of
Polling Place Ballots = Registered Voter Count x 80% x 45%);
absentee mail ballots were calculated at 30% (Amount of
Absentee Mail Ballots = Registered Voter Count x 80% x 30%);
absentee walk ballots were calculated at 20.6% of registered
voters (Amount of Absentee Walk Ballots = Registered Voter
Count x 80% x 25%) and reserve ballots were calculated at
4.6% of registered voters (Amount of Reserve Ballots =
Registered Voter Count x 80% x 6%).
 
16
  
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
For the 2012 General Election, the Office of Elections
modified the ballot order formula by utilizing the 2012
Primary Election voter turnout as the base and multiplied
the numbers by 125%. Due to concerns regarding the adequacy
of 6% as reserve ballots, that percentage was increased to
25%.
 
Thus, the 2012 General Election ballot order for the
polling places was 32.4% of the registered voters; absentee
mail ballots were calculated at 29.1%; absentee walk was
5.8%; and the number of reserve ballots, was increased to
25.1%.
 
. . . .
 
Additional ballots may also be printed by the vendor
on Election Day.
 
It further appears that 2012 was the first and only
 
time this methodology was employed; Ms. Tomczyk utilized a
 
different formula for the primary and general elections of 2008
 and 2010, a formula that was based on a methodology reflected in
 a document entitled Ballot Order 2002. 
We begin with the first part of HRS § 91-1(4), i.e., 
whether the agency has made a "statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency." Clearly, this methodology implements Hawai
'i election law, in particular 
HRS § 11-119(d) (2009), which requires delivery of "a sufficient number of ballots."
7 
We must also determine, however, whether the agency
 
made a statement of general applicability and future effect. 
There was no written methodology, but as evidenced by the supreme
 court's rulings in Hawaii Prince and Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, under
 some circumstances, an unwritten practice or policy can be a
 statement which constitutes a Chapter 91 rule. In Hawaii Prince,
 
7
 HRS § 11-119(d) provides:
 
(d) Each precinct shall receive a sufficient number
of ballots based on the number of registered voters and the
expected spoilage in the election concerned. A sufficient
 number of absentee ballots shall be delivered to each clerk
 not later than 4:30 p.m. on the fifteenth day prior to the
date of any election.

the calculation of "imparted value" was based on the City
 
appraiser's interpretation of a factor enumerated in the
 applicable law, i.e. "the effect of the value of the golf course
 
8
on the surrounding lands,"  and the City appraiser's
interpretation of this factor was of general applicability and future effect as it was applied to all golf course owners. 
Hawaii Prince Hotel Waikiki Corp.
, 89 Hawai 'i at 386, 393, 974 
P.2d at 26, 33. In Nuuanu Valley Ass'n, the practice of not disclosing preliminary engineering reports had both general applicability and future effect because it negated the rule requiring disclosure and it implemented, interpreted, or prescribed DPP's disclosure policies and practices. Nuuanu 
Valley Ass'n, 119 Hawai
'i at 99-100, 194 P.3d at 540-41. Here, 
while it appears that, as provided in HRS § 11-119(d), Appellees' employee took into consideration the number of registered voters in the methodology she used to determine the number of ballots to be ordered, the number of registered voters was merely a data point. There was no policy statement or interpretation of the statute; instead, there was a one-time calculation/miscalculation of what would be a sufficient number of blank ballots in the first instance, which was exacerbated by general election day errors in the delivery of reserve ballots. Importantly, it is clear from the record that the methodology used to determine the number of ballots was ad hoc, intended only for the 2012 elections, due to the reapportionment/redistricting process and that it involved unacceptably poor execution of an important government function. There is nothing in the record to indicate that this methodology was ever intended to or would ever be used again in the future. Thus, we conclude that the methodology used in 2012 to determine the number of blank ballots to be printed was not a "statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or 
8

policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice
 
requirements of any agency." See HRS § 91-1(4).9
 
This conclusion is supported by the supreme court's 
holdings that "[r]ulemaking is the process by which an agency lays down new prescriptions to govern the future conduct of those subject to its authority [and] . . . is essentially legislative in nature, not only because it operates in the future, but also because it is concerned largely with considerations of policy." Shoreline Transp., 70 Haw. at 591, 779 P.2d at 872 (citations omitted); See also In re Hawaiian Elec., 81 Hawai
'i at 466, 918 
at 568. Ms. Tomczyk's calculation/methodology was not intended and cannot be construed as a new prescription to govern future conduct of any sort. 
In addition, similar to Pila
'a 400, the applicable 
statute here contains only general rule-making authority, not a specific mandate to promulgate rules for determining the number of ballots to be printed.
10 Indeed, HRS § 11-4 is deliberatively 
permissive and discretionary, stating, in relevant part: 
§ 11-4 Rules and regulations.  The chief election
 
officer may make, amend, and repeal such rules and
regulations governing elections held under this title,
election procedures, and the selection, establishment, use
and operation of all voting systems now in use or to be
adopted in the State, and all other similar matters relating
thereto as in the chief election officer's judgment shall be
necessary to carry out this title.
 
(Emphasis added.)
  
We note that Appellants did not petition the Chief
 
Elections Officer for adoption or amendment of a rule, pursuant 
9
 This conclusion should not be construed as holding that a rule
could not be promulgated setting forth a methodology for the determination of
the number of blank ballots to be printed. 
10
 The Chief Election Officer's general mandate for rule-making, set
forth in HRS §§ 11-2(e) & 11-4 (2009), was complied with through the
promulgation of HAR chapters 3-171 through 3-176.

to HRS § 91-6,11
 and in fact challenge the Circuit Court's
FOF/COL and Order based in part on the argument that the Circuit
 
Court improperly considered Appellants' decision to pursue relief
 under HRS § 91-7
12
 rather than HRS § 91-6.  Thus, we need not
 
address whether a specific rule for determining the number of
 ballots was so "necessary" that Nago's judgment not to proceed
 with Chapter 91 rule-making was an abuse of the discretion
 granted in HRS § 11-4 or, alternatively, whether a "single
 formulaic methodology" is impracticable "[s]etting a general
 standard in this situation would be impractical to define by a
 general rule because [this] was an 'unforeseen situation' and 'so
 specialized and varying in nature so as to be impossible of
 capture within the boundaries of a general rule.'" Pila
'a 400, 
142 Hawai 'i at 266, 320 P.3d at 931 (citation omitted); see also

tentative judgment into a hard and fast rule.") (citation
 
omitted).
 
Finally, as we conclude that the methodology used to
 
determine the number of blank ballots to be printed for the 2012
 elections did not constitute an "agency statement of general
 . . . applicability and future effect" as provided in the first
 part of HRS § 91-1(4), this methodology was not a rule within the
 meaning of HRS § 91-1(4). Accordingly, we need not address the
 exception contained in the second part of HRS § 91-1(4), i.e.,
 whether the methodology concerned only the internal management of
 the agency and did not affect the private rights of or procedures
 available to the public.
2. Ballot Shortage
 
Appellants argue that the Circuit Court erroneously
 
concluded that the procedures used by a precinct to request
 additional ballots when the precinct runs out of ballots and
 receives additional ballots were not rules within the meaning of
 HRS § 91-1(4). With respect to this procedure, the Circuit Court
 found as follows: "On Election Day, precinct workers monitor the
 supply of paper ballots at the polling place and when it appears
 that the supply of ballots is running low, a precinct worker
 calls the counting center at the State Capitol and asks that
 reserve ballots for that precinct be delivered." Although it is
 unclear from the Circuit Court's findings and the record on
 appeal, we will assume without deciding that this procedure is
 pursuant to established written or verbal instructions from the
 Chief Elections Officer or his designee to the precinct workers
 and that the first part of HRS § 91-1(4) is satisfied. See
 
Holdman, 59 Haw. at 355, 581 P.2d at 117. 
Turning to the second part of HRS § 91-1(4), the
 
challenged procedure is directed exclusively to precinct workers
 in the execution of their election day responsibilities. In
 addition, although the procedure affects in an indirect way the
 public's interest in having reasonably prompt access to paper
 ballots on which to cast their vote, it is aimed at prescribing
 
21
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and controlling election-day workers in order to facilitate the 
rights of voters, and not at the private rights of or procedures available to the public. See, e.g., Claunch, 111 Hawai
'i at 66, 
137 P.3d at 380; Rose, 68 Haw. at 427, 717 P.2d at 1032 (holding that, without a direct impact, "the degree to which [the challenged bylaws] . . . affect the public's rights is not sufficient to require the public's input in their promulgation"); Doe v. Chang, 58 Haw. at 96, 564 P.2d at 1273; see also Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (explaining, although the
 right to vote is fundamental, "[i]t does not follow . . . that
 the right to vote in any manner... is absolute," an that all
 "[e]lection [regulations] will invariably impose some burden upon
 individual voters") (citations omitted). Thus, we conclude that
 the procedures used by a precinct to request additional ballots
 when the precinct runs out of ballots and receives additional
 ballots were not rules within the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4).
3. Counting Wrong Ballots 
Appellants argue that the procedures used to rectify
 
the situation when a voter casts a ballot that contains some
 races in which the voter is not entitled to vote were rules
 within the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4). As the Circuit Court found
 in FOFs 42-46, the vote counting equipment at each precinct is
 programmed to only accept votes for races in which the precinct
 voters are eligible to vote. Paper ballots containing votes in
 other races are rejected by the machines and placed by the voter
 into sealed emergency ballot bins, which are delivered to the
 central counting center where all eligible votes are manually
 counted. Votes casts in races for which voters in a particular
 precinct are not entitled to vote are not counted. All paper
 ballot votes entitled to be counted are counted either at the
 polling place or at the counting center.
 
This procedure appears consistent with HAR § 3-172­
80(g), which requires ballot box officials to deposit voters'
 paper ballots into the ballot box, HAR § 3-172-83(h), which
 requires voters to deposit marksense ballots into the ballot box
 
22
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
or the precinct counter, HAR § 3-172-86(b), which requires that
 
"voting materials from the polling places shall be transported to
 the counting center or designated locations in sealed ballot
 boxes with sealed lid locks and or sealed ballot transport
 containers by the [delivery and collection] team," and HAR § 3­172-92, which allows the Chief Elections Officer to use
 centralized counting, decentralized counting, or a combination of
 both. However, as Appellants state in their opening brief,
 "[t]he election office has no [specific] rules by which they may
 dispose of such ballots," i.e., ballots that included races for
 which voters in a particular precinct were not entitled to vote.
 
Appellants' statement, which is accurate, undermines 
their contention that the procedures used to rectify the situation when a voter casts a ballot that contains some races in which the voter is not entitled to vote is a rule. It does not appear that this procedure was a statement of general applicability and future effect directed at implementing, interpreting, or prescribing law, policy, or the procedural requirements of the Office of Elections. See HRS § 91-1(4). 
Rather it appears that the out-of-precinct ballots were problems that the Chief Elections Officer "could not reasonably foresee, problems which [needed to] be resolved despite the absence of a general rule." In re Hawaiian Elec., 81 Hawai
'i at 468, 918 P.2d 
at 570 (citation omitted). Even assuming, arguendo, that this procedure does satisfy the first part of the definition of a rule under HRS § 91-1(4), it appears to fall within the scope of the internal management exception. The procedure is clearly directed only at election workers; it was aimed at ensuring that all votes entitled to be counted were in fact counted and that no votes were counted in violation of HRS § 11-12 (2009);
13 it did not 
purport to regulate public conduct; and it ensured preservation 
13
 HRS § 11-12 provides, in relevant part, that "[n]o person shall
register or vote in any other precinct than that in which the person
resides[.]"
 
23
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of–rather than affected–the private rights of and procedures
 
available to the public.
 
Thus, we conclude that the procedures used to rectify
 
the situation where a voter casts a ballot that contained some
 races in which the voter was not entitled to vote were not rules
 within the meaning of HRS § 91-1(4).
B. Petition for Adoption of Rules Under HRS § 91-6
 
Appellants argue the Circuit Court erred "when it
 
determined that the obligation of the agency to promulgate rules
 
pursuant to the procedures laid down in HRS § 91-3 was mitigated
 or relieved if the interested person invoking the jurisdiction of
 the courts did not first apply to the agency to engage rule-
making under HRS § 91-6." Appellants, however, fail to cite to
 the record showing that the Circuit Court "determined that the
 obligation of the agency . . . was mitigated or relieved" by a
 failure to apply to the agency to engage in rule-making. This
 court cannot find an instance in which the Circuit Court came to
 that conclusion. As such, the Circuit Court did not err.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
In sum, mistakes were made in conjunction with the 2012
 
General Election. These mistakes may or may not be avoided in
 the future by adopting new and/or amending current election-
related regulations. However, we reject Appellants' arguments
 that the challenged election methodologies and procedures were
 rules under HRS § 91-1(4).
