STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
IOSEFA MEAFUA PASENE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE CIRCUIT CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0472)

 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-14-0001315,

 
Defendant-Appellant Iosefa Meafua Pasene (Appellant) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on November 5,
 2014 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (November 5, 2014
 Judgment). It appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction
 because the November 5, 2014 Judgment is not a final appealable
 judgment, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11.
 
"The right to an appeal is strictly statutory." 
State
 
v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai 'i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388, 391 (1996) 
(citation omitted). "Any party deeming oneself aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602 in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of the court." NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 641-11. "An offense . . . for which a sentence of
 
imprisonment is authorized constitutes a crime." HRS § 701­107(1).
 
The November 5, 2014 Judgment is neither a final
 
decision nor a final judgment because the sentencing in this case
 is incomplete. The November 5, 2014 Judgment indicates that the
 circuit court may impose restitution at a later date as a part of
 the sentence upon a State's motion.
 
Under similar circumstances in an appeal from a
 
district court judgment in a criminal case, we have held that a
 judgment is not final and appealable unless the sentence is
 final:
 
Judgments of conviction are not final unless they include
the final adjudication and the final sentence. In the
 instant case, the sentence imposed was not the final
sentence because the district court expressly left open the
possibility that its sentence of Kilborn might include an
order requiring Kilborn to pay restitution. The court did
 not finally decide whether it would order Kilborn to pay
restitution and, if so, in what amount. Consequently, the
December 5, 2003 Judgment is not final and, because it is
not final, it is not appealable.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from
the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
 
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai 'i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App. 
2005). 

Therefore, the November 5, 2014 Judgment is not an
 
appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-11. Absent an
 
appealable final judgment in the record on appeal, this court
 lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal.
