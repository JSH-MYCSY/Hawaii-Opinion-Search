30, 2016, by Hori, the papers in support, and the record, it
 
appears that:
 
(1) On January 22, 2015, the circuit court clerk
 
docketed this appeal and cross-appeal;

'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 54(c), stayed 
further proceedings in this appeal until the automatic bankruptcy stay had been lifted or terminated, and the parties complied with HRAP Rule 54(b) and (c); 
(3) On June 3, 2016, Hori filed a notice of the
 
bankruptcy court's December 7, 2015 order approving the parties'
 settlement agreement of all claims and all parties in this
 appeal. The bankruptcy court's order indirectly authorizes the
 parties to dismiss this appeal, which the court construes as an
 order lifting or terminating the bankruptcy stay; and
 
(4) On June 30, 2016, Hori filed a stipulation to
 
dismiss this appeal and cross-appeal, pursuant to HRAP Rule
 42(b), with each party to bear their own fees and costs. The
 stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for all parties
 appearing in the appeal.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation to
 
dismiss the appeal is approved and the appeal is dismissed with

prejudice. The parties shall each bear their own fees and costs
 
on appeal.
