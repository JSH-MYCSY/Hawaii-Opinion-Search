IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
DONALD B. MARKS, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 14-1-0008)
 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
AND
 
DISMISSING AS MOOT ALL PENDING MOTIONS
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction as to Petitioner-Appellant Donald B. 
Marks's (Appellant Marks) appeal from the Honorable Richard K. Perkins's October 21, 2014 order in S.P.P. No. 14-1-0008, which denied Appellant Marks's April 29, 2014 motion to withdraw his plea of no contest to murder in the second degree pursuant to Rule 32 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), because 
the October 21, 2014 order did not finally determine and end the proceedings that Appellant Marks initiated in S.P.P. No. 14-1­0008. Specifically, Marks also filed in S.P.P. No. 14-1-0008 a March 7, 2014 motion for correction of illegal sentence pursuant to HRPP Rule 35. 
"According to HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from
 
proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a
 judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court has not yet
 
entered a final order or final judgment that resolves all of the
 issues in both Appellant Marks's March 7, 2014 motion and
 Appellant Marks's April 29, 2014 motion. In S.P.P. No. 14-1­0008, the circuit court's October 21, 2014 order resolves only
 Appellant Marks's April 29, 2014 motion, and the October 21, 2014
 order clearly indicates that the circuit court retained this
 matter for a scheduled hearing on the merits of Appellant Marks's
 March 7, 2014 motion.
 
Absent an appealable final order or appealable final
 
judgment, Appellant Marks's appeal is premature, and we lack
 appellate jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0001319 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction
 without prejudice to any party's right to assert a timely appeal
 from a future final order or final judgment in S.P.P. No. 14-1­0008.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in CAAP-14-0001319 are dismissed as moot.
