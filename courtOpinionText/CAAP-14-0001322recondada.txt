APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-575K)
ORDER DENYING THE MAY 9, 2018 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
On May 9, 2018, Plaintiff-Appellee Capital One, N.A.
(Capital One ) filed its "Motion for Reconsideration of this
Court's Summary Disposition Order, Filed April 30, 2018" ( Motion
for Reconsideration).  Capital One argues that this court erred
in determining that there was a genuine issue of material fact as
to whether or not Capital One had standing at the time this
action commenced to foreclose upon a blank-endorsed Adjustable
Rate Note ( Note).  Capital One asserts that admissions by
Defendant-Appellant George P. Klika aka George Klika ( Klika)
"conclusively established that at the commencement of the
foreclosure proceedings and at the filing of the motion for
partial summary judgment, Capital One 'was the holder of the Note
and Mortgage' by virtue of an assignment."
In particular, Capital One asserts that Klika admitted
to Paragraph 12 of the "Complaint to Foreclose" ( Complaint ),
which states: 
12.  [Capital One] is the current holder of the Note and the
Mortgage (collectively, "Loan Documents") by virtue of an
Assignment of Mortgage and Note ("Assignment") dated
September 27, 2010, and recorded in the office of the
Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of
Hawai#i[.] . . .  A true and accurate copy of the Assignment
is attached hereto as Exhibit "3."
(Emphasis added.)  Paragraph 12 asserts Capital One is the holder
of the Note "by virtue of an Assignment of Mortgage and Note."   
A copy of the Note attached to the Complaint contains a blank
endorsement by an Assistant Vice President of Chevy Chase Bank,
F.S.B. (CCB ), the lender for the Note.  There is no allegation in
the Complaint, nor an admission by Klika, that Capital One was in
possession of the Note when it filed the Complaint.
2In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai #i
361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017), the Hawai #i Supreme Court recognized
that, despite assignment of a mortgage to Bank of America, the
bank did not establish standing to foreclose upon a blank-
endorsed note at the initiation of its suit:
An assignment of the Mortgage to Bank of America prior to
the commencement of the action would not be sufficient to
establish standing as an injury to the plaintiff in a
foreclosure proceeding, which is premised on the default
under the note.  Although the security follows the debt, the
debt does not automatically follow the security.  See HRS ยง
490:9-203(g) & cmt. 9 (2008) (codifying the common law rule
that a transfer of an obligation secured by a security
interest or other lien on personal or real property also
transfers the security interest or lien); see also, e.g.,
Vega v. CTX Mortg. Co., LLC, 761 F.Supp.2d 1095, 1097
(D.Nev.2011) ("The Traditional Rule is that the mortgage or
deed of trust (the security instrument) automatically
follows the secured debt, but not vice versa."); Restatement
(Third) of Property (Mortgages) ยง 5.4(c) (1997) ("A mortgage
may be enforced only by, or in behalf of, a person who is
entitled to enforce the obligation the mortgage secures.")
Id. at 371 n.17, 390 P.3d at 1258 n.17.
The Hawai #i Supreme Court further expressed that:
A blank indorsement occurs when an indorsement is made by
the holder of an instrument and is not a special
indorsement; in other words, a blank indorsement is not
payable to an identified person. [Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) ยง 490:3-205(a);] ยง 490:3-205(b).  When indorsed in
blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be
negotiated by transfer or possession alone until specially
indorsed.  Id.
Id. at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257 (emphasis added).  Further, in
analyzing the evidence in that case, the supreme court concluded:
a material question of fact exists as to whether Bank of
America possessed the Note, or was otherwise a holder, at
the time it brought the foreclosure action.  Indeed, the
copy of the Note attached to the summary judgment motion
does not reflect the date of the blank indorsement, and the
Egan Declaration, which was made after the filing of the
complaint in this case, does not indicate when the
indorsement occurred.  Further, there is no additional
evidence in the record regarding the date of the
indorsements or whether Bank of America possessed the Note
at the time of the filing of the complaint.  Thus, there is
a material question of fact as to whether Bank of America
was the holder of the Note at the time the foreclosure
proceedings were commenced, which in turn raises the issue
of whether Bank of America had standing to foreclose on the
Property at the time it brought the foreclosure action.
Id. (emphasis added).
3Given our reading of Reyes-Toledo, the applicable
statutes, and because the Note attached to the Complaint was
endorsed in blank, Capital One had the burden to establish that
it had possession of the Note when the Complaint was filed.  We
cannot infer "possession" from Klika's admission that Capital One
was the "holder of the Note . . . by virtue of an Assignment[.]"
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Capital One's May
9, 2018 Motion for Reconsideration is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 17, 2018.
