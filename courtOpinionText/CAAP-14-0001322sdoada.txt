APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-575K)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Ginoza, C.J., Fujise and Chan, JJ.)
In CAAP-14-1322, Defendant-Appellant George P. Klika
aka George Klika (Klika) appeals from the "Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff Capital One
N.A.'s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Decree of
Foreclosure, Filed July 15, 2014" ( FOFs/COLs and Order ) entered
on October 31, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
(circuit court ).1  In this appeal, Klika argues that the circuit
court erred by (1) finding that Plaintiff-Appellee Capital One
N.A. (Capital One) had standing to bring its foreclosure action,
(2) finding that the Loan Modification had been delivered to
Klika, (3) incorrectly determining the Unpaid Principal Balance
amount due under the Loan Modification, (4) failing to refute
Klika's affirmative defenses before granting summary judgment,
and (5) granting summary judgment before Klika had completed
discovery.  
In CAAP-16-620,2 Klika appeals from the "Order Granting
Plaintiff Capital One N.A.'s Motion for Confirmation of
Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Commissioner's Fees and Costs,
Distribution of Proceeds, Directing Conveyance, and for Writ of
Possession and for Disposal of Personal Property" entered on
March 18, 2016 and the "Order Granting Plaintiff Capital One
N.A.'s Motion for Determination of Deficiency Amount Including
Attorneys' Fees and Costs" entered on August 17, 2016, both in
the circuit court.  In this second appeal, Klika argues the
circuit court erred by (1) entering a deficiency judgment based

2 This court ordered consolidation of these appeals pursuant to a
stipulation by the parties. 
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
on a "void mortgage contract and note," (2) allowing inadmissible
hearsay in confirming the foreclosure sale, and (3) finding the
foreclosure sale was legally conducted where the Commissioner
sent all notices to Klika at the wrong address. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
vacate because there is a genuine issue of material fact
regarding Capital One's standing to foreclose.
In Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , the Hawai #i
Supreme Court held in a judicial foreclosure action that in order
to establish a right to foreclose, the foreclosing plaintiff must
establish standing, or entitlement to enforce the subject note,
at the time the action was commenced.  139 Hawai# i 361, 367-70,
390 P.3d 1248, 1254-57 (2017).  The holding in Reyes-Toledo is
dispositive in this case.
The supreme court stated that a foreclosing plaintiff
must typically "prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of
the agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice."  Id.  at 367,
390 P.3d at 1254 (citing Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson , 3
Haw. App. 545, 551, 654 P.2d 1370, 1375 (1982)).  Furthermore,
"[a] foreclosing plaintiff must also prove its entitlement to
enforce the note and mortgage."  Id. (citations omitted).  The
supreme court then expressed that "[a] foreclosing plaintiff's
burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note overlaps with the
requirements of standing in foreclosure actions as 'standing is
concerned with whether the parties have the right to bring
suit.'"  Id.  (brackets omitted) (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira, 95
Hawai#i 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  The supreme court
further stated that "[a]s standing relates to the invocation of
the court's jurisdiction, it is not surprising that standing must
be present at the commencement of the case."  Id. at 368, 390
P.3d at 1255 (citation omitted).  In concluding that the
foreclosing bank failed to satisfy its burden as the movant for
3NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
summary judgment, the supreme court reasoned: "[a]lthough Bank of
America produced evidence that it possessed the blank-indorsed
Note at the time it sought summary judgment, a material question
of fact exists as to whether Bank of America possessed the Note,
or was otherwise a holder, at the time it brought the foreclosure
action."  Id. at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257.
In the instant case, Capital One asserts that Klika's
Mortgage and Note, originally executed with Chevy Chase Bank,
F.S.B. (CCB ), was assigned to Capital One through an Assignment
of Mortgage and Note.  
On September 30, 2014, Capital One filed its Complaint
to Foreclose (Complaint ), which asserted in part that "[Capital
One] is the current holder of the Note and the Mortgage . . . by
virtue of an Assignment of Mortgage and Note[.]"  Attached to the
Complaint as an exhibit was a blank endorsed Note.  Also attached
to the Complaint was a "Verification" by Michael Pusateri
(Pusateri ), which declared that Pusateri was a Senior Unit
Manager of Capital One. 
On July 15, 2015, Capital One filed its Motion for
Partial Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure (MPSJ), and
attached, inter alia , a "Declaration" by Pusateri. 
On August 26, 2014, Capital One filed its "Supplemental
Memorandum Regarding [Capital One's] Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure" (Supplemental Memorandum ) and
attached an "Affidavit" by Pusateri.3 
Like the foreclosing plaintiff in Reyes-Toledo, Capital
One was granted summary judgment and a decree of foreclosure.  
This court reviews the circuit court's grant or denial
of summary judgment de novo.  Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai #i
48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005).
In U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos, also a judicial
foreclosure case, one of the issues on appeal was whether
3 Capital One subsequently re-submitted Pusateri's Affidavit as attached
to its "Submission of Original Affidavit of Michael Pusateri Re: Supplemental
Memorandum Regarding Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and
Decree of Foreclosure." 
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
relevant loan documents had been properly admitted through the
declaration of an individual named Richard Work ( Work), as
records of regularly conducted activity under Hawaii Rules of
Evidence ( HRE) 806(b)(6).  140 Hawai #i 26, 28, 30–33, 398 P.3d
615, 617, 619–622.  In his declaration, Work attested, inter
alia, that he was a "Contract Management Coordinator" of OCWEN
Loan Servicing, LLC (Ocwen), the "servicer" for plaintiff U.S.
Bank on the subject loan.  Id.  at 30–31, 398 P.3d at 619–20.
Because Work did not attest that he was the custodian of records
for either U.S. Bank or Ocwen, the supreme court noted that "the
documents attached to his declaration are admissible under the
HRE 803(b)(6) hearsay exception only if he is a 'qualified
witness' with respect to those documents."  Id. at 32, 398 P.3d
at 621.  The supreme court applied its analysis in State v.
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai #i 354, 365–66, 227 P.3d 520, 531–32 (2010)
and ruled as follows:
To the extent the ICA ruled that Work's declaration
established him as a "qualified witness" with respect to
Ocwen's records, we agree.  To the extent the ICA opinion
concluded that Work met the requirements to be a "qualified
witness" with respect to U.S. Bank's records, however, we
disagree.  Fitzwater addresses situations in which one
business receives documents created by another business and
includes them in its own records.  Work's declaration does
not indicate that U.S. Bank's Records were received by Ocwen
and incorporated into the Ocwen Records.  Work's declaration
also does not establish that Work is familiar with the
record-keeping system of U.S. Bank.  Rather, Work merely
states that he has access to and is familiar with U.S.
Bank's records.  Thus Work's declaration does not satisfy
foundational requirements to make him a "qualified witness"
for U.S. Bank's records pursuant to Fitzwater.
Mattos, 140 Hawaii at 32–33, 398 P.3d at 621–622 (emphasis
added).#
In light of its prior ruling in Reyes–Toledo , the
supreme court in Mattos  further held that:
[s]ince [an] allonge was apparently used to specifically
indorse the note to U.S. Bank, admissible evidence was
needed to demonstrate that U.S. Bank was in possession of
the note and allonge at the time of the filing of this
foreclosure complaint for U.S. Bank to be entitled to
summary judgment.
140 Hawai #i at 33, 398 P.3d at 622 (emphasis added).  Among other
shortcomings, the supreme court noted that Work's declaration did
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
not attest that U.S. Bank possessed the original note and allonge
when the foreclosure complaint was filed.  Id.   The supreme court
thus ruled that "Work's declaration failed to meet U.S. Bank's
burden of establishing facts necessary for a grant of summary
judgment."  Id.
In the instant case, the blank endorsed Note was
attached to the Complaint, which asserted that Capital One "is
the current holder of the Note" by virtue of an assignment. 
However, as to his qualification for admission of the Note,
Pusateri's Verification attached to the Complaint states only
that he is a "Senior Unit Manager" for Capital One and that:
[t]he factual allegations set forth in the Complaint herein
as described are true and correct to the best of my personal
knowledge to the extent I was personally involved, and
otherwise based on information and belief from documents and
correspondence kept by Capital One N.A. in the normal course
of its business.
Pusateri's Verification does not attest that he is the custodian
of records for either CCB or Capital One, and pursuant to the
analysis in Mattos, his verification does not establish that he
is a "qualified witness" with regard to the Note under the HRE
Rule 803(b)(6) hearsay exception.  Mattos, 140 Hawai #i at 30-33,
398 P.3d at 619-622, see also Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt ,
SCAP-16-0000645, 2018 WL 1325153, at *7-8 (Hawai #i Mar. 15,
2018). 
Pusateri's Declaration, attached in support of Capital
One's motion for summary judgment, similarly fails to establish
that he is either a custodian of records or a qualified witness
with regards to the Note.  Id.   
Finally, Pusateri's Affidavit also fails to qualify him
as a custodian of records or qualified witness with regards to
the Note.  Although Pusateri claims that some of his duties are
to "review documents and records that have been made and kept in
the ordinary course of Capital One's business and to testify on
Capital One's behalf as to the authenticity and validity of these
records and documents[,]" and that "[a] document, such as the
Note, is the type of document that is regularly made and kept in
the regular course of Capital One's business[,]" these assertions
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
do not pass muster under Mattos.  Moreover, CCB, not Capital One,
is the creator of the Note.  Id.  
Given the admissible evidence in the record, Capital
One failed to demonstrate that it was in possession of the blank
endorsed Note at the time this action was commenced.4  Viewing
the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to Klika, as
we must for purposes of reviewing a summary judgment ruling,
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Capital
One was entitled to enforce the subject Note when this
foreclosure action was commenced.  Thus, under Reyes-Toledo ,
Capital One has not met its initial burden to show that it was
entitled to summary judgment for the decree of foreclosure.
Given that Capital One did not establish its standing
to commence this foreclosure action, we need not reach Klika's
other points of error in either consolidated case.
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the following, all
entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, are vacated: 
(1) "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order
Granting Plaintiff Capital One N.A.'s Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure, Filed July 15, 2014," entered
on October 31, 2014; 
(2) "Order Granting Plaintiff Capital One N.A.'s Motion

Property," entered on March 18, 2016; and
(3) "Order Granting Plaintiff Capital One N.A.'s Motion
for Determination of Deficiency Amount Including Attorneys' Fees
and Costs" entered on August 17, 2016.

4  Although Capital One submitted an attorney affirmation on September
30, 2013, in compliance with Hawaii Revised Statutes § 667-17 (2016),  it
appears that recently, in Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, SCAP-16-0000645,
2018 WL 1325153 (Haw. Mar. 15, 2018), the Hawai #i Supreme Court implicitly did
not give any evidentiary merit to an attorney affirmation in the record in
that case.  See Wilmington Savings Fund Soc. v. Rohan, No. CAAP-17-0000433,
