(1)
 DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION,

(2) ALL PENDING MOTIONS ARE DISMISSED AS MOOT
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record on appeal, it appears that we
 
lack appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendants/
 
Counterclaimants/Cross-Claim Plaintiffs/Appellants Robert V.
 Gunderson, Jr. and Anne D. Gunderson (
collectively, Gundersons)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
have asserted from the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's March 16, 
2015 judgment, because the March 16, 2015 judgment neither resolves all claims nor contains a finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP), as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641­1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2013) requires for an appealable final judgment under HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i requires that "[a]n 
appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. "Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 
Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final 
judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58. 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. (original emphasis). 
The March 16, 2015 judgment does not contain the
 
finding necessary for certification under HRCP Rule 54(b). 
Therefore, in order to be an appealable final judgment, the
 March 16, 2015 judgment must resolve all claims involving the
 Gundersons, Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant/Appellee Jerry Elder
 as Trustee of the Elder Trust (Elder), and Defendant/
 
Counterclaimant/Cross-Claim Defendant The Bluffs at Mauna Kea
 
Community Association (The Bluffs).
 
Although the March 16, 2015 judgment enters judgment on
 
Elder's Complaint and Gundersons' Cross-Claim against The Bluffs,
 the March 16, 2015 judgment does not either enter judgment on or
 dismiss Gundersons' Counterclaim against Elders or The Bluffs'
 counterlaim against Elders.
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
While the March 16, 2015 judgment includes language 
that the judgment "resolves all claims as to all parties pursuant 
to Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure[,]" which appears to imply that there are no other outstanding claims (JROA Doc. 52 at 4283), the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Because the March 16, 2015 judgment does not, 
on its face, resolve all claims against all parties, the March 16, 2015 judgment fails to satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright. 
Absent an appealable final judgment, Appellants
 
Gundersons' appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001324.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001324 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction. All pending motions are dismissed as moot.
