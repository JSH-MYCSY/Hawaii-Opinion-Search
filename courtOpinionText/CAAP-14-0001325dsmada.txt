v.
 
COLLEEN MICHELE HAMILTON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(Kona Division)

(FC-D. NO. 13-1-070K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On November 26, 2014, Defendant-Appellant Colleen
 
Michele Hamilton (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of appeal;
 
(2) On November 28, 2014, the appellate clerk filed a
 
letter notifying Appellant of the $285 filing fee, or that she
 could request a fee waiver;
 
(3) On December 4, 2014, the appellate clerk issued
 
Appellant a notice of non-payment and absence of motion to
 proceed in forma pauperis, informing Appellant to pay the $285
 filing fee or file a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in
 forma pauperis by December 15, 2014, or the matter would be 
referred to the court for appropriate action, which may include
 
dismissal of the appeal;
 
(4) On February 26, 2015, the appellate clerk issued
 
Appellant a notice that the filing fee had not been paid, the
 record on appeal cannot be prepared without the fee or an order
 allowing Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis, and the matter
 would be called to the court's attention on March 9, 2015, for
 appropriate action, which may include dismissal. 
(5) Thereafter, Appellant took no further action in
 
this appeal; 
(6) The appellate clerk mailed each document to
 
Appellant at the address provided in the notice of appeal;
 
(7) The United States Postal Service returned each
 
document mailed from the appellate clerk to Appellant as
 undeliverable and unable to forward;
 
(8) Appellant failed to inform the court of any change
 
in address; and
 
(9) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 23, 2015.
