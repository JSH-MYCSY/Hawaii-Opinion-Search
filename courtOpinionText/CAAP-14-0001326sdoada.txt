IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ALISA L. VISSER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DWC-14-0001186)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Alisa Visser (Visser) appeals from
 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order entered on November
 
7, 2014 (Judgment), in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
1
Honolulu Division (District Court).  Visser was originally
 
charged with Theft in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii

 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-832(1)(a) (2014). However, after a
 
jury-waived trial, Visser was found guilty of the lesser-included
 
offense of Theft in the Fourth Degree, in violation of HRS § 708­833 (2014).
 
On appeal, Visser raises a single point of error,

 
contending that the District Court erred when it denied Visser's
 Motion for Judgment of Acquital because the State failed to
 present substantial evidence that the items allegedly stolen were
 valued at over $100.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Visser's point of error as follows:
 
HRS § 708-833(1) provides: "A person commits the
 
offense of theft in the fourth degree if the person commits theft
 of property or services of any value not in excess of $100."
2
 
Even if correct, Visser's only argument on appeal – that the
 State failed to prove value in excess of $100 – does not support
 reversing her conviction in this case because it is uncontested
 that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the stolen
 items had some value.
 
Accordingly, the District Court's November 7, 2014
 
Judgment is affirmed.
