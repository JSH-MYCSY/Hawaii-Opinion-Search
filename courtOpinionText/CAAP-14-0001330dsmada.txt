(Cr. No. 5DCC-14-0000081)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On December 1, 2014, Defendant-Appellant Punohu
 
Nalimu Kekaualua, III (Appellant), pro se, filed a notice of
 appeal;
 
(2) On December 2, 2014, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant of the $100 filing fee, or that he could request a fee
 waiver;
 
(3) On December 8, 2014, the appellate clerk issued
 
Appellant a notice of non-payment and absence of motion to
 proceed in forma pauperis, informing Appellant to pay the $100
 filing fee or file a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in
 forma pauperis by December 18, 2014, or the matter would be
 referred to the court for appropriate action, which may include
 dismissal of the appeal;
 
(4) On February 26, 2015, the appellate clerk notified
 
Appellant that the filing fee had not been paid, the record on
 
appeal cannot be prepared without the fee or an order allowing
 Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis, and the matter would be
 called to the court's attention on March 9, 2015, for appropriate
 action, which may include dismissal. 
(5) Thereafter, Appellant took no further action in
 
this appeal; and
 
(6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 23, 2015.
