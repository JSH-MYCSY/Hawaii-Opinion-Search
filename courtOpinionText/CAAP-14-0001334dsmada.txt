APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0067) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant 
Stanley S.L. Kong (Appellant Kong) has asserted from the Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti's November 12, 2014 interlocutory order denying Appellant Kong's request for entry of default, because the circuit court has not yet entered a separate
 final judgment as to all claims in Civil No. 13-1-0067 (JHC).

Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2014) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals 
under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). Consequently, 
"[a]n appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
On January 16, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001334,
 which does not include a final judgment. Although exceptions to
 the final judgment requirement exist under 
Forgay v. Conrad
, 47
 
U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2014), the November 12, 2014 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay
 doctrine, the collateral order 
doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b).  See Ciesla v. Reddish
, 78 Hawai 'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades
,

Schutte, Fleming & Wright , 88 Hawai 'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order 
doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). Absent an appealable final judgment, we lack appellate jurisdiction. The November 12, 2014 interlocutory order will be eligible for appellate review by way of a timely appeal from a future final judgment that resolves all claims against all parties, because "[a]n appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the case." Ueoka v Szymanski, 107 Hawai
'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 
902 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Adam, 97 Hawai
'i 475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) ("As a 
general rule, an appeal from a final judgment in a case brings up
 for review all preceding interlocutory orders in the case." 
(Citations omitted).). 
We must dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
 
[J]urisdiction is the base requirement for any court
considering and resolving an appeal or original action.
Appellate courts, upon determining that they lack
jurisdiction shall not require anything other than a
dismissal of the appeal or action. Without jurisdiction, a
court is not in a position to consider the case further.
Thus, appellate courts have an obligation to insure that
they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case. The
lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived by
any party at any time. Accordingly, when we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.
