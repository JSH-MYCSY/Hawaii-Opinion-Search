MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants District Council 50 of the
 
International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, and Aloha
 
Glass Sales & Service, Inc. (together, DC 50
) appeal from the (1)
 
November 6, 2014 "Final Judgment" and (2) November 6, 2014 "Order
 Affirming Board's Final Order Upon Remand," both entered in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit

 (circuit court).
 
On appeal, DC 50 contends the circuit court erred in:
 
(1) upholding the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs'
 (DCCA
) Contractors License Board (CLB) decision; (2) concluding
 
that the "window work at issue in the Lanakila Elementary School
 Project . . . was 'incidental and supplemental' to the remodeling

exhibits. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A detailed background of this case is laid out in Dist. 
Council 50, of Int'l Union of Painters and Allied Trades v. 
Lopez, 129 Hawai
'i 281, 298 P.3d 1045 (2013). As such, we 
provide only a brief summary of the background. 
This case involves the State of Hawai 'i's renovation 
project known as "Lanakila Elementary School Renovate and Paint Various Buildings [Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS)] Job No. 52-16-5581" (Lanakila Elementary Project). Id. 
at 283, 298 P.3d at 1047. In March 2006, DC 50 filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling that a "general building contractor with a B-license cannot engage in work requiring a C-22 subcontractor license under the general contractor's license." Id. at 285, 298 
P.3d at 1049 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The CLB hearings officer found that "incidental and
 
supplemental" in HRS § 444-8(c) (2013 Repl.)
3
 meant "work in
other trades directly related to and necessary for the completion of the project undertaken by a licensee pursuant to the scope of the licensee's license[,]" and recommended that the CLB deny the petition. District Council 50, 129 Hawai
'i at 286, 298 P.3d at 
1050 (quotations omitted). The CLB adopted the hearings officer's recommendation. Id. 
3
 HRS § 444-8 provides, in relevant part:
 
§444-8 Powers to classify and limit operations.
 
. . . .
 
(c) This section shall not prohibit a specialty
contractor from taking and executing a contract involving
the use of two or more crafts or trades, if the performance
of the work in the crafts or trades, other than in which the
specialty contractor is licensed, is incidental and
supplemental to the performance of work in the craft for
which the specialty contractor is licensed.
 
(Emphasis added.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court held that the CLB's 
interpretation of "incidental and supplemental" was plainly 
erroneous and inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose of HRS chapter 444. Id. at 289-92, 298 P.3d at 1053-56. 
The supreme court vacated the circuit court's judgment affirming the CLB's order, and remanded the case to the CLB "to reconsider whether the jalousie window work qualified as 'incidental and supplemental' to the [Lanakila Elementary] Project in light of the cost and extent of work involved." Id. at 292, 298 P.3d at 
1056. 
On remand, the CLB discussed the supreme court's
 
decision at its May 17 and July 18, 2013 meetings. On October
 22, 2013, the CLB issued the "[CLB's] Final Order Upon Remand"
 (Final Order), which announced the CLB's "New Test to Determine
 
When Specialty Contracting Work is 'Incidental and
 
Supplemental.'" The CLB summarized the test as follows.
 
[T]o qualify as "incidental and supplemental" work, that
work must represent less than 50% of the project (as
measured in relation to the project's total cost or extent),
and the work must be subordinate to, directly related to,
and necessary for the completion of the work of greater
importance that is within the scope of the licensee's
license (i.e., the primary work the specialty contractor is
licensed to perform).
 
Applying the test to the Lanakila Elementary Project, the CLB
 
found that "DC 50's cost estimate and percentages of the jalousie
 window work are less than a 'majority' of the total [Lanakila
 Elementary] Project cost." The CLB also found that "the jalousie
 window work was subordinate to, and is directly related and
 necessary for, the completion of the work of greater importance
 that is within the scope of the C-5 license." Finally, the CLB
 held that as an independent justification:
 
[A]lthough the [Lanakila Elementary] Project required the
fabrication and installation of the window frames and vinyl
slats, this work could be undertaken by a C-5 licensee
because of the method of window installation and the
 materials used, and that this work is not within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the C-22 license. Thus, the [CLB]
believes that either a C-5 or C-22 licensee could perform
the jalousie window work on the [Lanakila Elementary]
Project.

On November 6, 2014, the circuit court affirmed the
 
CLB's Final Order. DC 50 filed its notice of appeal on December
 
2, 2014.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Judicial Notice
 
"The appellate court applies 'two different standards 
of review in addressing evidentiary issues. Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion, unless application of the rule admits of only correct result, in which case review is under the right/wrong standard.'" Adams v. Yokooji, 126 Hawai
'i 420, 
423, 271 P.3d 1179, 1182 (App. 2012) (quoting State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai
'i 181, 189, 981 P.2d 1127, 1135 (1999)).
B. Secondary Appeals
 
"Review of a decision made by a court upon its review 
of an administrative decision is a secondary appeal. The standard of review is one in which [an appellate] court must determine whether the court under review was right or wrong in its decision." Brescia v. North Shore Ohana, 115 Hawai
'i 477, 
491, 168 P.3d 929, 943 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals of Cnty. of Hawaii, 109 Hawai
'i 
384, 391, 126 P.3d 1071, 1078 (2006)). 
The standard of review that applies to the circuit
 
court's review of an administrative proceeding is outlined in HRS
 § 91-14(g) (2012 Repl.), which states: 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or 
(6)	 Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are reviewable under
 
subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions regarding procedural
 defects under subsection (3); findings of fact under subsection
 (5); and an agency's exercise of discretion under subsection
 (6)." Brescia, 115 Hawai
'i at 491, 168 P.3d at 943 (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Sierra Club v. Office of
 Planning, State of Hawai
'i, 109 Hawai 'i 411, 414, 126 P.3d 1098, 
1101 (2006)). 
"'An agency's findings are not clearly erroneous and
will be upheld if supported by reliable, probative and
substantial evidence unless the reviewing court is left with
a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been
 made.'" Poe v. Hawai' i Labor Relations Bd., 105 Hawai' i 97,
100, 94 P.3d 652, 655 (2004) (quoting Kilauea Neighborhood
Ass'n v. Land Use Comm'n, 7 Haw. App. 227, 229-30, 751 P.2d
1031, 1034 (1988)). "'[T]he courts may freely review an
agency's conclusions of law.'" Lanai Co., [Inc. v. Land Use
Com'n, 105 Hawai' i 296, 307, 97 P.3d 372, 383 (2004)]
(quoting Dole Hawaii Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71
Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990) (other citation
omitted)). "Abuse is apparent when the discretion exercised
clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment
of a party litigant." Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawai' i 501,

III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Judicial Notice
 
In its reply brief to the circuit court, DC 50 argued
 
that the circuit court should take judicial notice of its
 
exhibits A, B, E, F, G, and H. DC 50 asks this court to reverse
 the circuit court's decision regarding this evidence, and
 requests that this court take judicial notice of these exhibits.
 
Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201 (1993) governs
 
judicial notice of adjudicative facts. HRE Rule 201(b) allows a
 court to judicially notice facts that are "not subject to
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known
 
within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2)
 capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources
 whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." The court is
 required to take judicial notice of an adjudicative fact "if
 requested by a party and supplied with the necessary
 information." HRE Rule 201(d). "Judicial notice may be taken at
 any stage of the proceeding." HRE Rule 201(f). 
Adjudicative facts "are the kind of facts that are 
ordinarily decided by the trier of fact; for example, who did what to whom, when, where, how, and why." State v. Puaoi, 78 
Hawai
'i 185, 190, 891 P.2d 272, 277 (1995); see HRE Rule 201 
commentary; see also Fed. R. Evid. 201 advisory committee notes. HRE Rule 201 does not apply to legislative facts. See HRE Rule 
201 commentary; Fed. R. Evid. 201 advisory committee notes. Legislative facts "are those which have relevance to legal reasoning and the lawmaking process, whether in the formulation of a legal principle or ruling by a judge or court or in the enactment of a legislative body." Fed. R. Evid. 201 advisory committee notes; see HRE Rule 201 commentary ("[J]udicial notice of legislative facts occurs when a judge is faced with . . . the interpretation of a statute[.]") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
DC 50 requested the circuit court, and now requests
 
this court, to take judicial notice of facts that fall within the
 realm of legislative rather than adjudicative facts. DC 50's
 Exhibit A and B are H. Con. Res. 88, 27
th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Haw.
 
2014) and H. Res. 63, 27th
 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Haw. 2014)
respectively, which are both described as "ENCOURAGING THE [CLB]
 TO RECONSIDER ITS OCTOBER 18, 2013, FINAL ORDER AND FOLLOW
 LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND THE HAWAII SUPREME COURT'S RULING THAT THE
 'INCIDENTAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL' EXCEPTION FOR SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS
 TO COMPLETE WORK FOR WHICH THEY ARE UNLICENSED IS VERY LIMITED IN
 SCOPE." Exhibit E is Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1436-14 on H. Res.
 63. Exhibit F is Stand. Comm. Rep. 1437-14 on H. Con. Res. 88. Exhibit G and H are printouts from the State of Hawai
'i's 
legislative webpage tracking H. Res. 63 and H. Con. Res. 88. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
These exhibits relate to the lawmaking process by a
 
legislative body and are therefore legislative, not adjudicative,
 
facts. It was not an abuse of discretion for the circuit court
 to decline to take judicial notice of the exhibits. We also
 decline to take judicial notice of these legislative facts.
 
We note that we need not take judicial notice of H. 
Res. 63 and H. Con. Res. 88 in order to consider their substance. Courts regularly consider extrinsic aids to determine legislative intent, including legislative history. See, e.g., First Ins. Co. 
of Hawaii v. A&B Props., 126 Hawai
'i 406, 415-17, 271 P.3d 1165, 
1174-76 (2012) (considering legislative committee reports elucidating the purpose of a bill in interpreting the relevant statute). 
However, we decline to consider the exhibits as 
evidence of the Hawai
'i legislature's intent behind the 
"incidental and supplemental" exception. H. Res. 63 and H. Con. Res. 88 were passed in 2014, years after HRS § 444-8 was enacted in 1957. "[T]he legislature has no power to direct the judiciary in the interpretation of existing statutes, since the legislative intent that controls is the construction of a statute which has reference to the legislature which enacted the act." Hot Springs 
Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 10 v. Fall River Landowners Ass'n, 262 N.W.2d 33, 39 (S.D. 1978) (citing 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 178); see Agran v. Checker Taxi Co., 105 N.E.2d 713, 715 (Ill. 1952) ("The legislature cannot direct the judiciary how cases shall be decided."); Bd. of Com'rs of Wyandotte Cnty. v. Gen. Sec. Corp., 138 P.2d 479, 487 (Kan. 1943) (concluding that a House bill purporting to declare the meaning of the legislature in enacting the statute was "unconstitutional because its provisions amount to an encroachment upon the judicial powers of the court by the legislature . . . .").B. CLB's Interpretation of "Incidental and Supplemental"
 
DC 50 argues that the "CLB's new interpretation of the
 
'incidental and supplemental' exception as any work 'less than
 50% of the project' . . . is as plainly erroneous and
 inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose as its
 definition in [Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR)] § 16-77-34,
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which the [Hawai 'i Supreme] Court rejected as 'plainly 
erroneous' . . . ." DC 50 contends the CLB Final Order is
 
inconsistent with both HRS § 444-8(c) and the supreme court's
 holding in District Council 50.
 
The circuit court's "Order Affirming Board's Final
 
Order Upon Remand" stated:
 
2.	 The [CLB] and its October 22, 2013 [Final Order] was
not clearly erroneous, contrary to law, or arbitrary
or capricious and was consistent with the Hawaii
Supreme Court's decision in [District Council 50].
 
a.	 In [District Council 50], the Court determined
that "incidental and supplemental" work "must
not make up the majority of the project, and
must instead be 'subordinate' and in addition to
 licensed work of 'greater importance'". The
 [Final Order] adopted this determination by the
[District Council 50] court.
 
b.	 The CLB and [Final Order] acknowledged the
Court's requirement that the "cost and extent"
of the other specialty contracting work must be
considered when determining if such work is
"incidental and supplemental". This is a
 reasonable interpretation of the Court's holding
in [District Council 50].
 
3.	 Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in
[District Council 50], the CLB and its [Final Order]
correctly interpreted and complied with said decision
in determining that the window work at issue in the
[Lanakila Elementary Project] was "incidental and
supplemental" to the remodeling and repair work on the
[Lanakila Elementary] Project.
 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
 
which is freely reviewable by this court." DW Aina Lea Dev., LLC
 
v. Bridge Aina Lea, LLC, 134 Hawai 'i 187, 213, 339 P.3d 685, 711 
(2014). "An agency's interpretation of its rule receives
 
deference unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
 underlying legislative purpose." District Council 50, 129
 
Hawai
'i at 287, 298 P.3d at 1051 (quoting Hawaii Teamsters and 
Allied Workers, Local 996 v. Dept. of Labor and Indus. Relations,
 110 Hawai
'i 259, 265, 132 P.3d 368, 374 (2006)). 
The supreme court in District 50 reviewed the CLB's
 
initial determination that "incidental and supplemental" means
 "work in other trades directly related to and necessary for the
 completion of the project undertaken by a licensee pursuant to
 the scope of the licensee's license." District Council 50
, 129
 
Hawai'i at 286, 298 P.3d at 1050 (citation and internal quotation 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
marks omitted). In interpreting the phrase "incidental and
 
supplemental," the supreme court conducted a plain language
 analysis, finding that "the ordinary meaning of 'incidental and
 supplemental' is 'subordinate to something of greater importance
 and supplying something additional.'" Id. at 290, 298 P.3d at
 
1054. The supreme court noted, "the 'incidental and
 supplemental' work must not make up the majority of the project,
 and must instead be 'subordinate' and in addition to licensed
 work 'of greater importance.'" Id.
 The supreme court concluded: 
While HRS § 444-8(c) created a narrow exception for
unlicensed work that is "subordinate to something of greater
importance and supplying something additional," the [CLB's]
expansive interpretation of the "incidental and
supplemental" exception creates a loophole for C-5
contractors to complete unlimited amounts of specialty work
for which they do not hold the requisite licenses. The
 [CLB's] refusal to consider cost and extent of work when
determining whether that work qualifies as "incidental and
supplemental" is plainly erroneous in light of the clear
meaning of HRS § 444-8(c). 
Id. at 291, 298 P.3d at 1055. 
The supreme court noted the legislative purpose "behind
 
contractor licensing laws in Hawai 'i is to 'protect the general 
public against dishonest, fraudulent, unskillful or unqualified
 
contractors.'" Id. at 291, 298 P.3d at 1055 (quoting Jones v.
 
Phillipson, 92 Hawai 'i 117, 125, 987 P.2d 1015, 1023 (App. 
1999)). In light of this purpose, the supreme court stated that
 "[t]o protect public health and safety, the [CLB's] rules must
 ensure that fully qualified contractors are completing all major
 work involved in a particular project." District Council 50, 129
 
Hawai
'i at 291, 298 P.3d at 1055. The supreme court concluded: 
In creating the "incidental and supplemental"
provision in HRS § 444-8(c), the legislature crafted an
exception for the completion of limited amounts of
unlicensed work. This exception must be interpreted
narrowly to preserve the statute's overarching purpose of
protecting public safety by insuring that work is completed
by fully competent contractors. In order to comply with
this statutory provision, and the overall purpose of HRS
chapter 444, the "incidental and supplemental" exception to
the C-5 license must be similarly limited. By allowing C-5
specialty contractors to complete all work related to and
necessary for the completion of a renovation project,
regardless of cost and extent, the [CLB] is contravening the
express purpose of HRS chapter 444.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 292, 298 P.3d at 1056. In remanding this case to the CLB,
 
the supreme court instructed the CLB to "reconsider whether the
 jalousie window work qualified as 'incidental and supplemental'
 to the [Lanakila Elementary] Project in light of the cost and
 extent of work involved." Id.
 
On remand, the CLB determined, in relevant part:
 
In light of the Supreme Court's Opinion, the [CLB]
acknowledges that the new test to determine whether
specialty contracting work is "incidental and supplemental"
requires a determination of whether such work is less than a
"majority" of the project, and is "subordinate" and "in
addition" to licensed work of "greater importance".
 
The [CLB] notes that although the Court did not define
the term "majority" in its decision, the term is generally
defined in well accepted dictionaries as a number or
percentage greater than half of a total. See, e.g., Black's
 
Law Dictionary 1040 (9 ed. 2009). 
 Consequently, the [CLB]
th 
interprets the term "majority" in the Court's ruling to mean
any amount greater than fifty per cent (50%). 
The [CLB] also acknowledges the Court's requirement
that the "cost and extent" of the other specialty
contracting work must be considered when determining if such
work is "incidental and supplemental". As a result, the
[CLB's] consideration of the "cost and extent" of the other
specialty contracting work will be factored into determining
whether the work constitutes less than a "majority" of the
project.
 
With respect to the requirement that the other
specialty contracting work be "subordinate" and in addition
to licensed work of "greater importance", the [CLB] notes
that these terms do not appear to be compatible with the
construction industry because one type of contracting work
is normally not characterized as being more important than
another type of contracting work. Regardless, the [CLB]
determines that in general, the primary work involved on a
construction project or in question will be considered to be
of "greater importance" and other related work will be
considered to be "subordinate".
 
. . . [T]he [CLB] also agrees that such [incidental
and supplemental] work must also be "directly related to and
necessary for the completion of the project undertaken by a
licensee pursuant to the scope of the licensee's license"
under its rule.
 
In summary, the [CLB] concludes that to qualify as
"incidental and supplemental" work, that work must represent
less than 50% of the project (as measured in relation to the
project's total cost or extent), and the work must be
subordinate to, directly related to, and necessary for the
completion of the work of greater importance that is within
the scope of the licensee's license (i.e., the primary work
the specialty contractor is licensed to perform).

nor intra-agency memoranda.
 
HRS § 91-8 (2012 Repl.) provides:
 
Any interested person may petition an agency for a
declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory
provision or of any rule or order of the agency. Each
 agency shall adopt rules prescribing the form of the
petitions and the procedure for their submission,
consideration, and prompt disposition. Orders disposing of
petitions in such cases shall have the same status as other
agency orders.
 
DC 50 argues, "Because the CLB's new definitions of 
'incidental and supplemental' are not limited to the particular 
facts of the case, but operate to 'delineat [sic] the future rights of an entire class of unnamed individuals'–-i.e., all C-contractors in the abstract–-the definitions are not a declaratory judgment." (Emphasis, citation, ellipsis, and brackets omitted.) DC 50 explains, "That definition of the statute's 'incidental and supplemental' exception affected not just the litigants but every C-contractor in the State of Hawai
'i 
in every contract forever." 
In response, the DCCA argues, and we agree, that the DC 
50 had commenced the action as a "Petition for Declaratory Ruling" in 2006, thus exempting the CLB's decision from the definition of "rule" under HRS § 91-1. See District Council 50, 
129 Hawai
'i at 284-85, 298 P.3d at 1048-49 ("On or about March 
24, 2006, [DC 50]. . . filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling (Petition) with DCCA's [CLB]. The [CLB] referred the Petition to the Office of Administrative Hearings for further proceedings on April 26, 2006. The Petition was filed pursuant to [HRS] § 444­4(9) (1995) and HAR § 16-201-48 (1990)." (footnotes omitted)).
D. CLB's Determination of the Lanakila Elementary Project
 
DC 50 also challenges the CLB's finding that the C-22
 
glazing work on the Lanakila Elemenatary Project was "incidental
 
and supplemental" to the primary contract work.
 
The CLB's Final Order stated:
 
[T]he [CLB] applied the Court's new "incidental and
supplemental" test to the cost and extent of work figures
provided by DC 50.
 
First, a determination of whether the jalousie window
work constitutes less than a "majority" of the [Lanakila
Elementary] Project must be made. 
According to Exhibit "3"
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of the Petition, Allied Pacific's overall bid to renovate
the [Lanakila Elementary] Project was $1,258,000.00. Fifty
percent of $1,258,000.00 is $629,000.00. DC 50's cost and
 extent of work estimate of $372,875.00 is clearly less than
$629,000.00. In addition, DC 50's percentages of 20% to 25%
are also clearly less than 50% of the overall [Lanakila
Elementary] Project cost. Consequently, the [CLB] finds
that DC 50's cost estimate and percentages of the jalousie
window work are less than a "majority" of the total
[Lanakila Elementary] Project cost.
 
Next, the [CLB] determines that the [Lanakila
Elementary] Project's overall remodeling and repair work to
the school's existing buildings or structures was the work
of greater importance (i.e., the primary work or the primary
component) of the [Lanakila Elementary] Project and thus,
could be undertaken by a C-5 specialty contractor. The
 [CLB] also concludes that the jalousie window work was
subordinate to, and is directly related and necessary for,
the completion of the work of greater importance that is
within the scope of the C-5 license.
 
Furthermore, and as an entirely independent
justification for the jalousie window work being performed
by a C-5 licensee, the [CLB] determines that although the
[Lanakila Elementary] Project required the fabrication and
installation of the window frames and vinyl slats, this work
could be undertaken by a C-5 licensee because of the method
of window installation and the materials used, and that this
work is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the C-22
license. Thus, the [CLB] believes that either a C-5 or C-22
licensee could perform the jalousie window work on the
[Lanakila Elementary] Project.
 
Based on the foregoing, the [CLB] concludes that in
light of the cost and extent of work involved, the jalousie
window work at issue is "incidental and supplemental" to the
remodeling and repair work on the [Lanakila Elementary]
Project and thus, could be performed by a C-5 licensee.
 
(Footnote omitted.) The circuit court affirmed the CLB's
 
findings, holding:
 
3.	 Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in
[District Court 50], the CLB and its [Final Order]
correctly interpreted and complied with said decision
in determining that the window work at issue in the
[Lanakila Elementary Project] was "incidental and
supplemental" to the remodeling and repair work on the
[Lanakila Elementary] Project.
 
On appeal, DC 50 makes no additional arguments other
 
than the ones presented in its challenge to the CLB's
 
interpretation of HRS § 444-8. Therefore, following the analysis
 above, we affirm the circuit court's holding.
