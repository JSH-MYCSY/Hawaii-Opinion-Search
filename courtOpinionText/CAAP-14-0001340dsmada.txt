ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant/Cross-Claim Plaintiff/ 
Cross-Claim Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Third-Party Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Michael J. Szymanski's (Appellant Szymanski) appeal from the Honorable Peter T. Cahill's November 24, 2014 judgment, because the November 24, 2014 judgment does not satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). The rules of court require that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 
P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). Furthermore, 
-2­ 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Jenkins,  76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (emphases added). 
When interpreting the requirements for an appealable final
 
judgment under HRS § 641-1(a) and HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court
 of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[i]f we do not require a judgment that resolves on its face
all of the issues in the case, the burden of searching the
often voluminous circuit court record to verify assertions
of jurisdiction is cast upon this court. Neither the
 parties nor counsel have a right to cast upon this court the
burden of searching a voluminous record for evidence of
finality, . . . and we should not make such searches
necessary by allowing the parties the option of waiving the
requirements of HRCP [Rule] 58.
 
Jenkins,  76 Hawai 'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338 (citation omitted; 
original emphasis). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be
 
dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face,
 either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the
 finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. 
(original emphasis).
 
The circuit court initially attempted to resolve all
 
claims against all parties in this case through three separate
 judgments:
 
(1) a March 20, 2003 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified

judgment as to one or more but fewer than all
claims or parties;
 
(2) an April 20, 2004 HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified
judgment as to one or more but fewer than all
claims or parties; and
 
(3) a July 28, 2010 judgment as to all remaining
claims.
 
However, on October 24, 2013, the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appeals entered a summary disposition order in appellate court 
case number 30697 that vacated the July 28, 2010 judgment and remanded this case to the circuit court for further proceedings. On remand, the circuit court purported to resolve all of the remaining claims by entering the subsequent November 24, 2014 judgment. Nevertheless, the November 24, 2014 judgment neither resolves all remaining claims nor does it contain an express finding of no just reason for delay in the entry of judgment as to one or more but fewer than all claims or parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). For example, the November 24, 2014 judgment does not expressly enter judgment on or dismiss Third-Party Defendants/Third-Party Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellees Adoa-Shinwa Development Corporation and Shinwa Golf Hawaii Co., Ltd.'s, November 7, 2002 counterclaim against Appellant Szymanski. Instead, the November 24, 2014 judgment provides that "[a]ny remaining claims . . . including that Counterclaim filed 
1
on November 7, 2012 [sic],  have been dismissed."  That 
particular sentence does not contain operative language that actually dismisses the counterclaim, but, instead, that sentence appears to merely refer to a prior dismissal order somewhere else in the record. 
"A judgment shall not contain a recital of 
pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings." HRCP Rule 54(a); 
see also Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 
118, 869 P.2d at 1337. Furthermore, the November 24, 2014 concludes with a statement that "[u]pon entry of this Final 
1
 Third-Party Defendants/Third-Party Counterclaim­
Plaintiffs/Appellees Adoa-Shinwa Development Corporation and Shinwa Golf
Hawaii Co., Ltd., actually asserted their counterclaim against Appellant
Szymanski ten years earlier, on November 7, 2002.
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment as to All Claims and Parties, all claims by and against 
all parties will have been resolved, and there will be no remaining claims or parties." (Emphasis added). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has explained that 
[a] statement that declares "there are no other outstanding
claims" is not a judgment. If the circuit court intends
 
that claims other than those listed in the judgment language
should be dismissed, it must say so: for example,
"Defendant Y's counterclaim is dismissed," or "Judgment upon
Defendant Y's counterclaim is entered in favor of
 Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Z," or "all other claims,
counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed."
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 n.4 
(emphases added). Because the November 24, 2014 judgment does 
not, on its face, resolve all remaining claims against all parties, the November 24, 2014 judgment fails to satisfy the requirements for an appealable final judgment under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins. We lack appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001340. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001340 is dismissed.
