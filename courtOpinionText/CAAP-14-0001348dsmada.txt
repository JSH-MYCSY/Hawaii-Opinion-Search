ORDER GRANTING JANUARY 14, 2015 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the January 14, 2015 motion to 
dismiss appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction (Motion) filed 
by Plaintiff-Appellee US Bank National Association as Trustee for CSFB Home Equity Asset Trust 2007-1 (Appellee US Bank National Association), (2) the lack of any memorandum in opposition to Appellee US Bank National Association's Motion, and (3) the record, it appears that we do not have appellate jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendants-Appellants Jose Cardenas Dingle, Jr. And Maria Cecilia Terrado Dingle (the Dingle Appellants) have asserted from the Honorable Randal B. Valenciano's November 5, 2014 judgment on a decree of foreclosure, because the Dingle Appellants's December 8, 2014 notice of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The November 5, 2014 judgment on a decree of
 
foreclosure is an appealable judgment pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 667-51(a)(1) (Supp. 2014). However, "[w]hen a
 civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be
 filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable
 order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The Dingle Appellants did not file
 their December 8, 2014 notice of appeal within thirty days after
 entry of the November 5, 2014 judgment on a decree of
 foreclosure. Therefore, The Dingle Appellants' December 8, 2014
 notice of appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The
 failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is

 
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court
 for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default
 occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the
 failure to give timely notice of appeal."). Consequently, we
 lack appellate jurisdiction over this case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee US Bank
 
National Association's January 14, 2015 motion to dismiss appeal

 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction is granted, and appellate
 court case number CAAP-14-0001348 is dismissed for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction.
