   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Motion for Summary Judgment, entered by the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, Newton contends that the Circuit Court erred
 
by: 
(1) Granting USBNA's summary judgment motion without
 
having subject matter jurisdiction and through USBNA's alleged
 commission of forgery, uttery, and perjury; 
(2) Failing to dismiss the case for lacking 
jurisdiction after Newton raised the issue in her Hawai
'i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) (2006) motion; 
(3) Failing to dismiss the case for lack of accuracy
 
and evidentiary support; and 
(4) Entering its decision and order without personal
 
jurisdiction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Newton's points of error as follows:
 
We first consider Newton's argument that the Circuit
 
Court erred in failing to dismiss the case for lack of
 jurisdiction after she raised various contentions in her HRCP
 Rule 60 motion, including that the Mortgage states that "[t]he
 security instrument shall be governed by federal law and the law
 of the jurisdiction in which the property is located," and 28
 U.S.C. § 1332 requires that the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai
'i has original jurisdiction. Newton appears to

misunderstand the above-referenced Mortgage language, which
 
specifies the choice of laws, rather than mandating exclusive
 federal jurisdiction. Newton's argument that the Circuit Court
 lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this foreclosure action
 on this ground is without merit and Newton's other jurisdictional
 arguments appear to go to her arguments on the merits. Newton's
 argument that the court was without personal jurisdiction is
 equally infirm because she failed to raise this issue in a
 pretrial motion to dismiss under HRCP Rule 12(b)(2), and where a
 party has been personally served with the complaint and summons
 and an alleged lack of personal jurisdiction is not properly
 raised, it is waived pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(h). The record on
 appeal includes a Return and Acknowledgment of Service evidencing
 personal service on Newton.
 
We next turn to the attorney affirmation attached to
 
the complaint for foreclosure in this case. HRS § 667-17 (Supp.
 2015) provides as follows: 
§ 667-17 Attorney affirmation in judicial
foreclosure. Any attorney who files on behalf of a
mortgagee seeking to foreclose on a residential property
under this part shall sign and submit an affirmation that
the attorney has verified the accuracy of the documents
submitted, under penalty of perjury and subject to
applicable rules of professional conduct. The affirmation
shall be filed with the court at the time that the action is
 commenced and shall be in substantially the following form:

various courts around the nation were reported by
 major mortgage lenders and other authorities,
 including failure to review documents and files to
 establish standing and other foreclosure requisites;
 filing of notarized affidavits that falsely attest to
 such review and to other critical facts in the
 foreclosure process; and "robosignature" of documents.

[____________], Esq., pursuant to Hawaii Revised
Statutes § 667-17 and under the penalties of perjury,
affirms as follows:
 
1. 	I am an attorney at law duly licensed to practice in
the State of Hawaii and am affiliated with the Law
 Firm of __________________, the attorneys of record
for Plaintiff in the above-captioned mortgage
foreclosure action. As such, I am fully aware of the
underlying action, as well as the proceedings had
herein.
 
2. 	On [date], I communicated with the following
representative or representatives of Plaintiff, who
informed me that he/she/they (a) personally reviewed
plaintiff's documents and records relating to this
case for factual accuracy; and (b) confirmed the
factual accuracy of the allegations set forth in the
Complaint and any supporting affidavits or
affirmations filed with the Court, as well as the
accuracy of the notarizations contained in the
supporting documents filed therewith.

3. 	Based upon my communication with [persons specified in
item 2], as well as upon my own inspection and other 
reasonable inquiry under the circumstances, I affirm
that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and
belief, the Summons, Complaint, and other papers filed
or submitted to the Court in this matter contain no
 false statements of fact or law and that plaintiff has
legal standing to bring this foreclosure action. I
understand my continuing obligation to amend this
Affirmation in light of newly discovered material
facts following its filing.
 
4. 	I am aware of my obligations under Hawaii Rules of
Professional Conduct.

HRS § 667-17

The Affirmation here substantially conforms with HRS
 
§ 667-17, except that the second paragraph states:

2. On May 30, 2013, I received a written
communication from Justi Nicole Hillberry, Assistant Vice
President of Bank of America, N.A., the servicing agent for
plaintiff in the above captioned mortgage foreclosure
action, which informed me that she made an affirmative
 determination that the facts alleged in previously filed
affidavits are factually accurate, notwithstanding that she
was unable to confirm that the underlying documents
previously filed with the Court were properly reviewed or
notarized at the time they were filed because records
sufficient to demonstrate such compliance conclusively were
not maintained contemporaneous with the prior filings.
Records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with present
review and notarization requirements are now maintained.
 
(Emphasis added). 
This attorney affirmation fails to state that a
representative of USBNA informed counsel that he/she "personally
 
reviewed plaintiff's documents and records relating to this case

 
for factual accuracy; and (b) confirmed the factual accuracy of
 the allegations set forth in the Complaint."
2 HRS § 667-17. 
As this court has previously noted, "[t]he intent of [the
 statute's] attorney affirmation requirements was to ensure that
 attorneys investigate foreclosure materials for themselves and
 authenticate documents they represent to the courts." Bank of
 
America, N.A. v. Lanzi, No. CAAP-13-0002550, 2014 WL 4648169, at
 1 (Hawai
'i App. Sept. 17, 2014) (SDO). Without these provisions, 
an affirmation does not further the intent of the statute. Id. 
Here, the affirmation fails to provide the critical assurance and
 authentication. Thus, we conclude that the affirmation does not
 substantially conform with HRS § 667-17. As the affirmation is

 The Affirmation is followed in the record by a May 30, 2013
"Statement of Review," signed and declared under penalty of perjury by Justi
Nicole Hillberry, "Assistant Vice President[,] Bank of America, N.A."
(Hillberry). Hillberry states that she is "authorized to sign this affidavit
on behalf of Plaintiff [USBNA]," and Newton does not directly challenge this
assertion. However, even assuming that Hillberry is a representative of USBNA
for purposes of HRS Chapter 667, Hillberry does not state that she personally
reviewed plaintiff's documents and records relating to this case for factual
accuracy or that she confirmed the factual accuracy of the allegations set
forth in the Complaint.

deficient, USBNA has not shown that it is entitled to summary
 
judgment. Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in
 granting summary judgment to USBNA in this case.
 
Accordingly, we need not reach the other issues raised
 
by Newton in this appeal.
 
We hereby vacate the Circuit Court's November 5, 2014
 
Judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.
