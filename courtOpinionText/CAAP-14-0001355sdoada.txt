IN RE MARN FAMILY LITIGATION
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
This appeal is one of many in the Marn Family
 
Litigation, which has been ongoing for almost twenty years. See 
In re Marn Family, No. SCWC-10-0000181, 2016 WL 7385570, at *1
 
(Haw. Dec. 21, 2016). 
Here, Defendant-Appellant Alexander Y.

Marn (Alex) appeals,  pro se, from a post-judgment Order Granting
 
Receiver Ronald K. Kotoshirodo's Motion to Expunge Non-Consensual
 Common Law Lien (Order to Expunge) filed on November 24, 2014, in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).

in this case, only Alex filed an opening brief, and he did so on behalf of
only himself.

Although Alex raises numerous arguments that are not 
properly before the court on appeal from the Order to Expunge, 
Alex raises a single point of error germane to this appeal, arguing that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in expunging the lien filed by Alex and Eric against a property located at N. Judd St. in Honolulu, Hawai
'i (Property). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Alex's appeal as follows:
 
First, as Appellee Liquidating Receiver S. Steven Sofos
 
(Sofos) contends and to the extent that this court is able to
 
3
discern,  Alex did not appear at the hearing on the motion to
expunge, file a memorandum in opposition, or otherwise oppose the

 
motion. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-2 (2016), provides,
 
in relevant part: "The appellate court may correct any error
 
appearing on the record, but need not consider a point that was
 not presented in the trial court in an appropriate manner." 
The general rule is that an issue which was not raised in
the lower court will not be considered on appeal. There are
 sound reasons for the rule. It is unfair to the trial court
 to reverse on a ground that no one even suggested might be
error. It is unfair to the opposing party, who might have
met the argument not made below. Finally, it does not
comport with the concept of an orderly and efficient method
of administration of justice.
 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prod., 86 Hawai 'i 214, 248, 
948 P.2d 1055, 1089 (1997) (citations and internal quotation 
marks omitted; format altered). Alex makes no argument why this

 Alex has failed to state "where in the record the alleged error
was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the
attention of the court," as is required pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court should undertake a plain error review, or why "justice 
otherwise requires" this court to review his arguments raised for the first time on appeal. It appears that Alex waived any argument against the expungement of the lien and that, therefore, the Order to Expunge should be affirmed. 
See Paul v. Dep't of 
Transp., 115 Hawai 'i 416, 428, 168 P.3d 546, 558 (2007). 
In any case, Alex's arguments that the Circuit Court

 
abused its discretion and otherwise erred in expunging the lien
 is without merit. 
Alex primarily contends that the Circuit Court lacked 
jurisdiction to expunge the lien because the Property at issue was Land Court property, his "lis pendens" was a statutory lien filed pursuant to HRS §§ 501-151 and 634-51, and only the Land Court has jurisdiction in the matter. As a preliminary matter, Alex claimed no direct interest in or title to the Property; rather, he sought to encumber the Property while he appealed the Circuit Court's rejection of his attempt to overbid a cash buyer of the Property with two purportedly available, but undocumented, loans and a "credit bid" related to the sale of the McCully Shopping Center. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that the 
application of lis pendens should be limited to actions directly claiming title to or a right of possession of real property. S. 
Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 480, 484, 866 P.2d 951, 956 (1994). Contrary to Alex's assertion, the lien here was not a proper statutory lien simply because an appeal was pending from the order and judgment confirming the sale of the Property. There was no stay of the 
3

order and judgment confirming the sale of the Property. Alex's 
filing of an appeal of the confirmation order and judgment did not support the filing of a lis pendens. See, e.g., TSA Int'l 
Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 265-67, 990 P.2d 713, 735­
37 (1999). 
Thus, the Circuit Court properly exercised its 
jurisdiction to expunge the lien as a nonconsensual common law lien pursuant to HRS § 507D-7 (2006), which states, in part: "If the circuit court finds the purported lien invalid, it shall order the registrar to expunge the instrument purporting to create it, and order the lien claimant to pay actual damages, costs of suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees." HRS § 507D-7(a). In addition, with respect to Land Court property, the supreme court has held that "the circuit court has jurisdiction to expunge a lis pendens pursuant to HRS § 501-151 (1993), HRS § 501-152 (1993), and TSA International Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai
'i 243, 990 P.2d 713 (1999)[.]" Knauer v. Foote, 101 Hawai 'i 
81, 83, 63 P.3d 389, 391 (2003). 
Alex further contends that the Circuit Court
 
"compounded" its lack of jurisdiction by prohibiting him (and
 Eric) from further filings in the Land Court or at the Bureau of
 Conveyances, without prior leave of court. This argument is not
 well founded. Under HRS § 507D-2 (2006), a "Nonconsensual common
 law lien" is a lien that: "(1) Is not provided for by a specific
 statute; (2) Does not depend upon, require by its terms, or call
 for the consent of the owner of the property affected for its
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
existence; and (3) Is not a court-imposed equitable or
 
constructive lien." HRS § 507D-7(b) provides, in relevant part:
 
If the circuit court finds the purported lien is
frivolous, upon application of a party in interest, the
registrar, or the government counsel representing the
government officer or employee affected by the purported
lien, the court may also issue appropriate injunctive relief
against the lien claimant to preclude further filings of any
kind with the registrar for a period of five years, unless
that person obtains leave of court to file another
instrument with the registrar.
 
"'Frivolous' means without any basis in law or fact." 
HRS § 507D-2. HRS Chapter 507D gives the circuit courts the
 
authority to impose such injunctive relief as issued here. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to prohibit Alex
 from filing at the Bureau of Conveyances or Land Court for five
 years without leave from the court.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's November 24, 2014
 
Order to Expunge is affirmed.
