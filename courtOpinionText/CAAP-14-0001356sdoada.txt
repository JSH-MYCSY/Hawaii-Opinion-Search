SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
 
In these consolidated appeals, Defendant-Appellant

 
Michael Jean Panzo (Panzo) appeals from, inter alia, the January
 
20, 2015 "Order Denying [Panzo's] Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief
 
from Judgment and for Evidentiary Hearing Filed September 18,
 2014" (Order Denying Relief), and the August 18, 2015 Judgment
 
(Confirmation Judgment), which entered judgment on the August 18,
 2015 Order Granting Motion for Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale,
 
Allowance of Costs, Commissions, Fees, Directing Conveyance and
 for Writ of Possession Filed April 15, 2015 (Confirmation Order)
 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 Court).
1
 
Panzo did not, however, appeal from the July 1, 2014
 
Judgment (Foreclosure Judgment), which was entered pursuant to
 the July 1, 2014 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All
 Parties and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed July
 25, 2013 (Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree).
 
In both appeals now before us, Panzo contends that
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America),
 
lacked standing to foreclose on the subject mortgage and,
 
therefore, the Circuit Court erred in denying relief from the
 Summary Judgment/Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure Judgment in
 favor of Bank of America, as well as in entering the Confirmation
 Order.

3Notwithstanding the Hawai #i Supreme Court's recent
decision in Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , __ Hawai #i __,
__ P.3d __, No. SCWC-15-0000005, slip op. at 12-14 (Feb. 28,
2017) (holding that a foreclosing plaintiff must establish its
standing to foreclose by producing evidence that, at the time of
the filing of the complaint, it was entitled to foreclose upon
the defaulted note), we conclude that the res judicata  effect of
the Foreclosure Judgment bars Panzo's request for relief in this
appeal.  See Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise , 130
Hawai#i 11, 304 P.3d 1192 (2013).  In Wise, the supreme court
held that, in foreclosure cases, the doctrine of res judicata
precludes foreclosure defendants from raising defenses at the
confirmation of the sale of the subject property that could have
been raised in the earlier foreclosure proceedings, even if the
res judicata defense is impliedly waived.  Id. at 17-18, 304 P.3d
at 1198-99.  
Here, Bank of America did not raise the issue of res
judicata .  Nevertheless, the opinion in  Wise specifically states
that the preclusive effect of this doctrine can be raised on
appeal by the appellate court.  Id.  at 18, 304 P.3d at 1199.  The
supreme court held that a "serious inconsistency" would otherwise
result and therefore, "in the limited circumstances of
foreclosure proceedings, we consider the merits of the res
judicata defense, even if impliedly waived."  Id.  In Wise, like
in the case now at bar, the foreclosure defendants' failure to
appeal from the foreclosure judgment precluded them from raising
the issue of standing on appeal from the order confirming sale. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Id. at 19, 304 P.3d at 1200. Thus, we conclude that, having not
 
preserved the standing argument in conjunction with the
 Foreclosure Judgment, Panzo is not entitled to relief based on a
 standing argument in this appeal from the subsequent confirmation
 sale proceedings.
 
This court has similarly held, citing Wise and Citicorp 
Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i 422, 433-34, 16 P.3d 827, 
838-39 (App. 2000), that when the issue of standing to foreclose is barred by res judicata, an attempt to seek relief pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b) "is an untimely 
second bite at the apple." HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v. Collman, No. 
CAAP-13-0005087, 2016 WL 4480724 at *1 (Haw. App. August 24, 2016) (SDO); see also, e.g., Bank of America v. Kuchta, 21 N.E.3d 1040, 1045-47 (Ohio 2014) (res judicata precluded foreclosure defendants from relitigating standing in a Rule 60(b) proceeding). Therefore, Panzo's challenge to the Order Denying Relief, based on the issue of standing, is also without merit. 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's January 20, 2015 Order
 
Denying Relief and August 18, 2015 Confirmation Order and
 Confirmation Judgment are affirmed.
