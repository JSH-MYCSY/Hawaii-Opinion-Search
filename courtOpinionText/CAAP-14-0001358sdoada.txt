Defendant-Appellant Cheyne T. Todani (Todani) appeals
 
from a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
 
(Judgment), entered by the District Court of the First Circuit,

 
'Ewa Division (District court), on October 22, 2014.1 After a 
bench trial, the District Court convicted Todani of Operating a
 Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or
 Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an

 HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) and (2) provides:
 
(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a

sentenced him pursuant to HRS § 291E-62(b)(3) (Supp. 2014).3
 
On appeal, Todani argues that the District Court erred 
in convicting him (1) after erroneously admitting his traffic 
abstract (Abstract) into evidence; (2) where Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) failed to adduce evidence that he had 
notice of his license revocation; (3) where the evidence was insufficient to show that he was convicted of OVLPSR-OVUII twice within five years before the instant offense; (4) where the State failed to show he was represented by counsel in the proceedings in Cr. Nos. 1DTC-10-010025 and -056244; and (5) after erroneously finding that the choice-of-evils defense was inapplicable. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Todani's points of error as follows:
 
I.
 
The State adduced sufficient evidence that within five
 
years prior to the instant OVLPSR-OVUII offense, Todani was twice
 convicted of OVLPSR-OVUII. This evidence included (1) the
 
2(...continued)
(1)	 In violation of any restrictions placed on the
person's license;
 
(2)	 While the person's license or privilege to
operate a vehicle remains suspended or
revoked[.]
3
 HRS 291E-62(b)(3) provides, in relevant part:
 
(b) Any person convicted of violating this section
shall be sentenced as follows without possibility of
probation or suspension of sentence:
 
. . . .
 
(3)	 For an offense that occurs within five years of
two or more prior convictions for offenses under
this section . . . :
 
(A)	 One year imprisonment;
 
(B)	 A $2,000 fine; [and]
 
(C)	 Permanent revocation of the person's
license and privilege to operate a
vehicle[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
June 10, 2010 judgments in Cr. Nos. 1DTC-10-010025 and -056244
 
respectively, and (2) Todani's Abstract.
 
The District Court did not err in admitting the 
Abstract into evidence because it was relevant to show Todani had two prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions within five years prior to the instant offense. See HRS § 291E-62(b)(3). Cf. State v. Gomez, 
134 Hawai
'i 478, 344 P.3d 362, No. CAAP-12-0000642 2015 WL 894866 
(App. Feb. 27, 2015) (SDO). These prior convictions made it more likely Todani knew or should have known his license was revoked when he drove on February 24, 2014, and also made it more likely he was a repeat offender. 
Construed together, the Judgment in Cr. No. 1DTC-10­
056244, citation and Notice of Administrative Revocation (NAR) in this case, and Abstract demonstrate that Todani was the person convicted of OVLPSR-OVUII in Cr. No. 1DTC-10-056244. See HRS 
§ 706-666(2) (2014). See, e.g., State v. Davis, 133 Hawai
'i 102, 
122-23, 324 P.3d 912, 932-33 (2014); Gomez, 134 Hawai 'i 478, 344 
P.3d 362, No. CAAP-12-0000642 2015 WL 894866 at *3. Cf. State v. 
Nishi, 9 Haw. App. 516, 527, 852 P.2d 476, 482 (1993). 
In finding that Todani had two prior convictions for 
OVLPSR-OVUII within the five years prior to the instant offense, the District Court erroneously referred to a judgment of conviction in Cr. No. 1DTC-10-089183. However, it is clear the court instead meant to refer to the Judgment in Cr. No. 1DTC-10­056244. The error was harmless. See State v. Reed, 77 Hawai
'i 
72, 80 n.14, 881 P.2d 1218, 1226 n.14 (1994) overruled on other grounds by State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai
'i 279, 1 P.3d 281 (2000). 
The District Court did not abuse its discretion in 
concluding that the Abstract's probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Hawaii Rules of Evidence 
(HRE) Rule 403 and 404(b). See State v. Lioen, 106 Hawai
'i 123, 
132-33, 102 P.3d 367, 376-77 (App. 2004).

The Abstract is self-authenticating, under HRE
 
Rule 902, as a signed certification attesting to it being part of 
official records of the district court appears on the last page. As Todani presents nothing that calls this certification in question, his argument is without merit. 
See HRE Rule 902; HRS 
§§ 606-4 (1993) and -8 (1993); Davis, 133 Hawai 'i at 120-21, 324 
P.3d at 930-31. 
II.

 
The State adduced sufficient evidence that Todani knew
 
or should have known his driver's license was revoked when he
 drove on February 24, 2014.
 
As discussed, the State demonstrated that Todani had
 
two prior OVLPSR-OVUII convictions within five years prior to the
 instant offense, which made it more likely he had notice that his 
license was revoked when he drove.
 
Further, as the District Court found, the
 
Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office's (ADLRO's)
 September 23, 2013 Notice of Administrative Review Decision
 (NARD) indicates Todani's license was revoked for a two-year
 period, which included the date on which he was arrested for
 OVLPSR-OVUII here. Todani has not met his burden to rebut the
 presumption that he received the NARD, which was mailed on
 September 23, 2013 to his address as reflected on the NAR, which
 address Officer Thomas Billings (Officer Billings) obtained from
 Todani's state ID with Todani's assurance that the information
 was current. See HRS § 291E-37 (Supp. 2015); State v. Martin, 62
 
Haw. 364, 375, 616 P.2d 193, 200-01 (1980).
 
Further, the testimony of Officer Billings was
 
sufficient to establish that Officer Billings reviewed the NAR
 with Todani after his arrest in September 2013. The NAR notified
 Todani that the ADLRO would automatically conduct an
 administrative review at which Todani was not entitled to appear
 and then mail to Todani its decision within eight days after
 issuance of the NAR. Based on the information in the NARD, NAR,
 and advisement by Officer Billings, Todani should have known to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
check his mail for the NARD before or on September 23, 2013, at
 
any address to which his mail may have been sent.
 Last, as the District Court reasonably inferred, 
Todani and his mother's respective testimonies at trial strongly suggested that Todani knew he was prohibited from driving. See 
Lioen, 106 Hawai
'i at 130, 102 P.3d at 374. 
III.
 
The State established that Todani was represented by 
counsel at the time of his prior OVLPRS-OVUII convictions in Cr. Nos. 1DTC-10-010025 and -056244. See State v. Pantoja, 89 
Hawai
'i 492, 498, 974 P.2d 1082, 1088 (App. 1999). The Abstract 
shows that on February 11, 2010, in Cr. No. 1DTC-10-010025, Todani was referred to the Office of the Public Defender, and on April 15, 2010, he was represented by Deputy Public Defender (DPD) Dawn Nekoba. The Abstract also reflects that on June 10, 2010, DPD Nicole Gibby was present when Todani entered no contest pleas in Cr. Nos. 1DTC-10-010025 and -056244. 
IV.
 
The District Court did not clearly err by finding that 
the choice-of-evils defense was inapplicable. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there was substantial evidence to support the District Court's conclusion. See HRS § 703-302 (2014). As the court found, Todani obtained control of the vehicle when he took the keys from his mother and could have called 911. Further, there is no evidence showing Todani was prevented from calling a taxi, helping his mother catch a bus, or asking someone besides Fry to drive. See e.g., 
State v. Poouahi, 130 Hawai
'i 348, 310 P.3d 1049, No. 29890, 2010 
WL 2513356 at *1 (App. Jun. 23, 2010) (SDO); State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai
'i 63, 71-72, 996 P.2d 268, 275-76 (2000).
