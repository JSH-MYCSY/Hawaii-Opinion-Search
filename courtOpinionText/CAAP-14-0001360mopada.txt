Kalena Kaia Basug (together, Appellants) appeal from the "Order
 
Denying [Appellants'] Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment;
 
For Evidentiary Hearing; For Leave to File Responsive Pleading;
 and For Stay Pending Hearing on Rule 60(b) Motion, Filed on July
 14, 2012" (Order Denying Rule 60(b) Motion) entered on November
 
13, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1
 (circuit
 
court).
 
On appeal, Appellants contend the circuit court: (1)
 
"abused its discretion when it effectively held that
 
[Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellee U.S. Bank National
 Association, as Trustee for Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
 Series 2006-NC2 (
U.S. Bank)] did not need to prove standing as
 
the real party in interest and that it could, therefore,
 judicially foreclose on the subject property" and (2)
 "incorrectly denied [Appellants'] Motion for Relief from
 Judgment." (Emphasis omitted.)
I. BACKGROUND
 
U.S. Bank filed a complaint in circuit court on August
 
24, 2007 (Complaint) alleging that Appellants defaulted on their
 
mortgage and seeking foreclosure of Appellants' property.
 
Appellants filed their answer to the Complaint as well as
 counterclaims against U.S. Bank on November 13, 2007.
 
On November 5, 2013, U.S. Bank filed a motion for
 
summary judgment "on all claims" (Motion for Summary Judgment).
 
Appellants did not object to this motion. On March 12, 2014, the
 
circuit court entered its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law,
 and Order Granting [U.S. Bank's] Motion for Summary Judgment on
 All Claims, Filed November 5, 2013, and Interlocutory Decree of
 Foreclosure." On March 28, 2013, the circuit court entered its
 amended order granting summary judgment for U.S. Bank. The
 circuit court entered a judgment and decree of foreclosure
 (Judgment) on May 6, 2014. No appeal was taken from the
 
Judgment.
 
1 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On July 14, 2014, Appellants filed "[Appellants'] Rule
 
60(b) Motion for Relief From Judgment; For Evidentiary Hearing;
 
For Leave to File Responsive Pleading; and For Stay Pending
 Hearing on Rule 60(b) Motion" (Rule 60(b) Motion). On November
 
13, 2014, the circuit court entered the Order Denying Rule 60(b)
 
Motion. Appellants filed their notice of appeal from the circuit
 court's denial of their Rule 60(b) Motion on December 11, 2014.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Motion for Relief from Judgment
 
An order denying a motion for relief from a judgment 
made pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
60(b) is reviewed on appeal under the abuse of discretion standard. Hawai
'i Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai 'i 144, 147, 
883 P.2d 65, 68 (1994). "[T]o constitute an abuse of discretion a court must have clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26-27 (1992) (citing State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 78, 828 P.2d 269, 271 (1992)). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
On appeal, Appellants2
 attempt to challenge the circuit
court's grant of U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment. 
However, Appellants did not appeal from the May 6, 2014 Judgment
 and instead appealed from the circuit court's Order Denying Rule
 60(b) Motion.
 
HRCP Rule 60(b) allows a court to relieve a party from
 
a final judgment for:
 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
 
2 We note at the outset that Appellants' opening brief does not conform
to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4), which requires a
section containing a "concise statement of the points of error set forth inseparately numbered paragraphs. Each point shall state: (i) the alleged errorcommitted by the court or agency; (ii) where in the record the alleged erroroccurred; and (iii) where in the record the alleged error was objected to orthe manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of thecourt or agency." Appellants failed to comply with subsections (ii) and (iii)of Rule 28 in their opening brief. Appellants' counsel is warned that futurefailure to comply with HRAP Rule 28 may result in sanctions.

intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment. 
"An order denying a motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP
 
60(b) is an appealable final order under [Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS)] § 641-1(a)
3
 [(2015 Supp.)]."  Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawai'i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 974, 981 (2003) (citing First Trust Co. 
of Hilo v. Reinhardt, 3 Haw. App. 589, 592, 655 P.2d 891, 893 (1982)) (dismissing the appellants' points on appeal as waived for failure to "argue or explain how any of the provisions of HRCP Rule 60(b) . . . are implicated"). 
Appellants do not argue at any point in their opening 
brief that the circuit court should have granted their Rule 60(b) Motion based on any of the reasons enumerated above. Appellants argue only that the circuit court erred in holding that there were no genuine issues of material fact, an argument appropriate if Appellants were appealing the circuit court's grant of U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment. Because Appellants make no argument regarding the circuit court's denial of their Rule 60(b) Motion, Appellants waive this point on appeal. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."); see also Ditto, 103 Hawai
'i at 161-62, 80 P.3d at 982-83. 
Furthermore, this court does not have jurisdiction over
 
Appellants' attempted appeal of the circuit court's grant of U.S.
 Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment. The circuit court entered
 Judgment granting U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment on May
 6, 2014. Appellants filed their notice of appeal on December 11,
 2014. Even if Appellants had included the circuit court's
 Judgment granting U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment in
 their notice of appeal, the appeal would not have been timely. 
See HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) ("When a civil appeal is permitted by law,
 the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of
 
3 HRS § 641-1(a) allows appeals "in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district courts and the land
court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602."

the judgment or appealable order."). The failure to file a
 
timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a jurisdictional
 defect that the parties cannot waive and the appellate courts
 cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial discretion. Bacon
 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986); see HRAP
 Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to
 change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of
 these rules.").
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Order Denying Defendants and
 
Counterclaimants Kendra Brooks and Clorinda Basug's Rule 60(b)
 Motion for Relief from Judgment; For Evidentiary Hearing; For
 Leave to File Responsive Pleading; and For Stay Pending Hearing
 on Rule 60(b) Motion, Filed on July 14, 2012" entered on November
 13, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
