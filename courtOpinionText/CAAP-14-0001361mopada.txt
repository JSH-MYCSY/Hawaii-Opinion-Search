IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAINOA H. KAHELE-BISHOP, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-047K)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kainoa H. Kahele-Bishop (Kahele-
Bishop) appeals from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence"
 
entered on November 25, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the Third
 
1
Circuit  (Circuit Court), convicting him of Robbery in the First
Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708­840(1)(b) (2014) (Robbery) (Count 1), Unauthorized Entry into
 Motor Vehicle in the First Degree in violation of HRS
 § 708-836.5(1) (2014) (UEMV) (Count 2), and Theft in the Second
 degree in violation of HRS § 708-831(1)(b) (2014) (Theft Second)
 (Count 3).
 
On appeal, Kahele-Bishop contends that (1) the Circuit 
Court erred in failing to instruct the jury on merger of the Robbery and Theft Second counts; (2) the Circuit Court erred in giving an unresponsive answer to the jury's question; (3) the complaint filed by Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai
'i (State) 
was deficient; and (4) the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the items that Kahele-Bishop allegedly stole exceeded $300.

DISCUSSION
 
I. Merger Instruction
 
Kahele-Bishop argues that the Circuit Court's failure
 
to instruct the jury regarding merger of the Robbery and Theft
 
Second counts amounts to reversible error as there was a
 reasonable possibility that the jury's verdict led to two
 convictions for the same conduct.
 
HRS § 701-109(1)(e) (2014)2
 "interposes a constraint on
multiple convictions arising from the same criminal conduct[,]"
 State v. Matias, 102 Hawai
'i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003), 
and "reflects a policy to limit the possibility of multiple
 convictions and extended sentences when the defendant has
 basically engaged in only one course of criminal conduct directed
 at one criminal goal." Id. (citation, brackets, and internal
 
quotation marks omitted). In general,
 
[w]hether a course of conduct gives rise to more than one
crime within the meaning of HRS § 701–109(1)(e) depends in
part on the intent and objective of the defendant. The test
 to determine whether the defendant intended to commit more
 than one offense is whether the evidence discloses one
 general intent or discloses separate and distinct intents.
Where there is one intention, one general impulse, and one
plan, there is but one offense. All factual issues involved
 in this determination must be decided by the trier of fact.
 
Id. (brackets and emphasis omitted) (quoting State v. Hoey, 77
 
Hawai'i 17, 27 n.9, 881 P.2d 504, 514 n.9 (1994)). Thus, if 
there is a possibility that two counts in a complaint are
 
"grounded in 'the same conduct,'" HRS § 701-109(1) mandates, "at
 a minimum, that the circuit court instruct the jury regarding
 
2
 HRS § 701-109(1)(e) provides:
 
§701-109 Method of prosecution when conduct
establishes an element of more than one offense. (1) When
the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of
more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for
each offense of which such conduct is an element. The
 defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one
offense if: 
. . . .
 
(e) 	The offense is defined as a continuing course of
conduct and the defendant's course of conduct
 was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that
specific periods of conduct constitute separate
offenses.

merger." State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawai 'i 76, 80, 156 P.3d 1182, 
1186 (2007). 
The record before us indicates the complaining witness
 
(CW) was parked on the shoulder of South Point Road, when a white
 
car pulled in front of her 1995 purple Corvette. CW identified
 Kahele-Bishop as the driver of the car and testified that a
 female passenger (Female) exited the car from the passenger side,
 raised a hatchet, and told CW to leave her Corvette. CW
 testified that the Female lunged at her and swung the hatchet,
 but that CW disarmed the Female and flung the hatchet into the
 nearby bushes. CW testified that the Female then entered the
 driver's side of CW's Corvette and tried to take the Corvette
 using the keys that were still in the car. As CW struggled to
 prevent the Female from stealing her Corvette, Kahele-Bishop ran
 to the passenger side of the Corvette, looked through CW's bag
 "real quickly," took CW's bag, and then drove off in his car.
 
The jury convicted Kahele-Bishop of both Robbery and
 
Theft Second.
 
HRS § 708-840(1)(b) provides:
 
§708-840 Robbery in the first degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of robbery in the first degree if, in
the course of committing theft or non-consensual taking of a
motor vehicle:
 
. . . .
 
(b)	 The person is armed with a dangerous instrument
or a simulated firearm and:
 
(i) 	The person uses force against the person
of anyone present with intent to overcome
that person's physical resistance or
physical power of resistance; or
 
(ii) 	The person threatens the imminent use of
force against the person of anyone present
with intent to compel acquiescence to the
taking of or escaping with the property[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
HRS § 708-831(1)(b) provides:
 
§708-831 Theft in the second degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of theft in the second degree if the
person commits 
theft . . . (b) Of property or services the
value of which exceeds $300
.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Emphasis added and format altered.) A person commits a "theft"
 
if he or she "obtains or exerts unauthorized control over the
 property of another with intent to deprive the other of the
 property." HRS § 708-830(1) (2014). "Theft, regardless of
 degree, is an included offense of first degree robbery." State
 
v. French, 104 Hawai
'i 89, 93, 85 P.3d 196, 200 (App. 2004) 
(citing State v. Vinge, 81 Hawai 'i 309, 319, 916 P.2d 1210, 1220 
(1996)). 
Based on the evidence presented, the jury could have
 
found that Kahele-Bishop's involvement amounted to both Robbery

 
3
 and Theft Second or that his actions were part of a single
intent and plan. 
The question of whether Kahele-Bishop's 
involvement constituted two "separate and distinct culpable acts" or one "uninterrupted continuous course of action" should have been submitted to the jury to decide.  See Matias, 102 Hawai
'i 
at 306, 75 P.3d at 1197 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Circuit Court's jury instructions, which omitted any instruction regarding the possible merger of the Robbery and Theft Second charges, were prejudicially insufficient and, therefore, plainly erroneous.
4 See id. at 306, 75 P.3d at 1197. 
II. Sufficiency of Charge
 
Kahele-Bishop argues for the first time on appeal that
 
the State's complaint was insufficient because (1) the charge of
 UEMV failed to describe the vehicle entered without authority and
 to name the owner of the vehicle; and (2) the Theft Second charge
 failed to allege the requisite state of mind for each element of
 the offense.
 
3
 We note that the record does not indicate whether the jury found
Kahele-Bishop guilty of Robbery based on the attendant circumstance that
Kahele-Bishop, as a principal or accomplice, used or threatened the use of
force "in the course of committing theft" or whether Kahele-Bishop, as a
principal or accomplice, used or threatened the use of force "in the course of
committing . . . [a] non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle[.]" HRS
 § 708-840(1); see also HRS § 708-842 (2014) (stating that an act is deemed to
be "in the course of committing a theft or non-consensual taking of a motor
vehicle" if, inter alia, "it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or
non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle").
 
4
 Because we vacate and remand this case for failure to provide the
jury with a merger instruction, we need not address Kahele-Bishop's argument
that the circuit court's answer to the jury question was also prejudicial.

Under the "Motta/Wells[ 5
] post-conviction liberal
construction rule," we liberally construe charges challenged

for the first time on appeal. Under this approach, there is
a "presumption of validity," for charges challenged
subsequent to a conviction. In those circumstances, this
court will "not reverse a conviction based upon a defective
indictment or complaint unless the defendant can show
prejudice or that the indictment or complaint cannot within
reason be construed to charge a crime." However, the rule
does not apply when reviewing timely motions challenging the
sufficiency of an indictment.
 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 399-400, 219 P.3d 1170, 1186­
87 (2009) (internal citations and brackets omitted). Because 
Kahele-Bishop challenges the sufficiency of the complaint for the first time on appeal, we employ the Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal construction rule in our review of the State's complaint. See State v. Maharaj, 131 Hawai
'i 215, 218-19, 317 P.3d 659, 662­
63 (2013) (applying the liberal construction standard where the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the complaint for the first time on appeal). Under this approach, the charge is presumed valid. State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai
'i 312, 318, 55 
P.3d 276, 282 (2002) ("in Motta this court adopted a rule . . . which essentially prescribes a presumption of validity on indictments that are challenged subsequent to a conviction."). 
Kahele-Bishop does not argue, nor does the record
 
support, that he was prejudiced by the language employed in the
 complaint. See Motta, 66 Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d 1020. Therefore,
 
we turn our attention to whether the complaint cannot, within
 reason, be construed to charge a crime. See id.
 
A. Count 2--UEMV
 
In Count 2, the complaint against Kahele-Bishop

 
charged, in relevant part:
 
COUNT 2 (C14002514)
 
On or about the 26th day of January, 2014, in the
County and State of Hawai' i, KAINOA H. KAHELE-BISHOP, as a
principal and/or accomplice, intentionally and/or knowingly
entered and/or remained unlawfully in a motor vehicle,without being invited, licensed, and/or otherwise authorizedto enter and/or remain within the vehicle, with the intentto commit theft and/or assault, a crime against a personand/or property rights, thereby committing the offense ofUnauthorized Entry into Motor Vehicle in the First Degree,in violation of [HRS § 708-836.5(1) (2014)] as amended.

 State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019 (1983) and State v. 
Wells, 78 Hawai' i 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kahele-Bishop argues that due process required that the 
State include the name of the owner of the vehicle and the 
"vehicle's make, model, year, color, license plate number, or VIN number" in the charge. "[T]he sufficiency of the charging instrument is measured, inter alia, by 'whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he or she must be prepared to meet.'" Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 (2009) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Merino, 81 Hawai 'i 198, 212, 
915 P.2d 672, 686 (1996)). 
[A] charge not only serves the function of establishing the
jurisdiction of the court, but also "informs the defendant
of the nature and cause of the accusation" against him or
her, Haw. Const. [a]rt. I § 14, and provides the defendant
with notice for purposes of due process, Haw. Const. [a]rt.
I § 5 ("No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property without due process of law.").
 
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i 48, 65, 276 P.3d 617, 634 (2012) 
(brackets in original omitted). 
Generally, "where the statute sets forth with 
reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended 
to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute is sufficient." Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180 (brackets omitted) 
(quoting State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 (1977)). 
HRS § 708-836.5 provides:
 
§708-836.5 Unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle in
the first degree. (1) A person commits the offense of
unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the first degree if
the person intentionally or knowingly enters or remains
unlawfully in a motor vehicle, without being invited,
licensed, or otherwise authorized to enter or remain within
the vehicle, with the intent to commit a crime against a
person or against property rights.
 
(2) Unauthorized entry into motor vehicle in the first
degree is a class C felony.
 
Contrary to Kahele-Bishop's argument on appeal, the
 
State was not required to prove who owned the vehicle allegedly
 
entered into or the make/model of the vehicle in order to convict
 Kahele-Bishop of first degree unauthorized entry into a motor
 vehicle. See HRS § 708-836.5; see cf. State v. Nases, 65 Haw.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
217, 218, 649 P.2d 1138, 1139-40 (1982) ("The particular 
ownership of the property in question was not an essential element in proving the crime [of theft in the third degree] and there is no fatal variance between the charge and the proof."). Therefore, the State's charge was legally sufficient because HRS § 708-836.5, from which the language of the charge is drawn, sets forth all the essential elements of the offense. See Wheeler, 
121 Hawai
'i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180. 
B. Count 3--Theft Second
 
Kahele-Bishop challenges the sufficiency of the Theft
 
Second charge, arguing that the complaint's single mention of
 "intent to deprive" was not sufficient to apprise Kahele-Bishop
 of the state of mind for the offense.
 Kahele-Bishop was charged, in Count 3 as follows:
 
COUNT 3 (C14002515)
 
On or about the 26th day of January, 2014, in the
County and State of Hawai' i, KAINOA H. KAHELE-BISHOP, as a
principal and/or accomplice, obtained and/or exerted
unauthorized control over the property of another, a bagand/or laptop computer and/or cell phone and/or walletand/or U.S. currency and/or credit card(s) belonging to[CW], the value of which exceeded $300.00, with intent todeprive [CW] of the property, thereby committing the offenseof Theft in the Second Degree, in violation of [HRS§§ 708-830(1) and 708-831 (1)(b) (2014)], as amended. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held: "A charge that 
fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be construed 
reasonably to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process." State v. 
Apollonio, 130 Hawai
'i 353, 359, 311 P.3d 676, 682 (2013) (citing 
State v. Elliott, 77 Hawai 'i 309, 313, 884 P.2d 372, 376 (1994)). 
Thus, "state of mind requirements, though not an element of an offense[, are] required to be included in the charges against the defendants in order to alert the defendants of precisely what they need[] to defend against to avoid a conviction." State v. 
Gonzalez, 128 Hawai
'i 314, 324, 288 P.3d 788, 798 (2012) (quoting 
Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i at 56, 276 P.3d at 625). 
Kahele-Bishop was charged and convicted of theft in the
 
second degree, pursuant to HRS § 708-831(1)(b). In State v.
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mitchell, 88 Hawai 'i 216, 965 P.2d 149 (App. 1998), this court 
held that 
[t]he material elements of theft in the second degree
are . . . that the defendant intended to: (1) obtain or
exert unauthorized control over the property of another, HRS
§ 708–830(1); (2) deprive the other of his or her property,
id.; and (3) deprive another of property that exceeds $300
in value (valuation element). HRS § 708–831(1)(b).
 
Mitchell, 88 Hawai 'i at 222, 965 P.2d at 155. "Pursuant to HRS 
6
§ 702-207 [(2014) ], the state of mind of 'intent' applies to
each material element of the offense." Id. "The State must
 
prove each of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt in order
 to make a prima facie showing of theft." Id. (citing HRS § 701­
114 (2014) 
7
); see State v. Cabrera, 90 Hawai 'i 359, 366-69, 978 
P.2d 797, 804-07 (1999) (adopting the analysis in Mitchell and
 holding that "the 'intentional' state of mind attaches to all of
 the elements of the offense [of theft in the second degree],
 including the attendant circumstance of the value of the property
 taken").
 
Here, the language of the charge sufficiently conveyed
 
the requisite state of mind as to all the elements. 
The charge
 
specified the items Kahele-Bishop was alleged to have taken and
 that "the value of which exceeded $300," that he "obtained and/or
 
6
 HRS § 702-207 provides:
 
§702-207 Specified state of mind applies to all
elements. When the definition of an offense specifies the
state of mind sufficient for the commission of that offense,
without distinguishing among the elements thereof, the
specified state of mind shall apply to all elements of the
offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.
 
7
 HRS § 701-114 provides in relevant part:
 
§701-114 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (1) Except as
otherwise provided in section 701-115, no person may be
convicted of an offense unless the following are proved beyond
a reasonable doubt:
 
(a) 	Each element of the offense;
 
(b) 	The state of mind required to establish each
element of the offense;
 
(c)	 Facts establishing jurisdiction;
 
(d) 	Facts establishing venue; and
 
(e) 	Facts establishing that the offense was committed
within the time period specified in section
701-108.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
exerted unauthorized control over the property[,]" "with the
 
intent to deprive [CW] of the property[.]" Given the presumption
 of validity of the relaxed Motta/Wells standard, we conclude that
 the charge adequately informed Kahele-Bishop of the offense.
III. Sufficiency of Evidence
 
Kahele-Bishop also argues the State failed to prove
 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the items he
 
allegedly stole exceeded $300. Initially, we note that Kahele-
Bishop did not challenge the evidence in support of the Theft
 Second charge below.
8 Nevertheless, we review the sufficiency of
 
the evidence for plain error. State v. Rodrigues, 6 Haw. App.
 
580, 733 P.2d 1222 (1987). 
The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact."
'Substantial evidence' as to every material element of the
offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient
quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to support a conclusion.
 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) 
(formatting altered, citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted). To this we would add that, "evidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction." Id. 
HRS § 708-801(1) (2014) provides that, "[e]xcept as
 
otherwise specified in this section, value means the market value
 of the property or services at the time and place of the offense,
 or the replacement cost if the market value of the property or
 services cannot be determined." CW testified during the State's
 examination that Kahele-Bishop took a bag from her car that held
 her Acer laptop, cell phone, and a wallet holding her credit
 cards and money. She also testified that she purchased the Acer
 laptop and cell phone herself. When the deputy prosecutor asked,
 "And the items . . . purchased that were located within this bag,
 was that worth more than $300?" CW answered, "Yes, it was." 
8
 Indeed, his counsel argued that he was guilty of Theft Second. ("I
said from the beginning of this trial, too, that you should find him guilty of
theft, because he actually grabbed something, there's a little dispute about
what he grabbed; nevertheless he grabbed something. He went into [CW's]
vehicle and he grabbed it.")
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kahele-Bishop's counsel did not object to the deputy prosecutor's
 
question during trial nor does he challenge the admissibility of
 CW's statement on appeal.
9
 
Therefore, the evidence before us was sufficient to 
prove that the items Kahele-Bishop allegedly stole from CW was worth more than $300. See State v. Thorp, 134 Hawai
'i 116, 334 
P.3d 779, No. CAAP-13-0000414, 2014 WL 4914623 at *1 (App. Sept. 30, 2014) (SDO) (holding that the record contained sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for theft in the second degree and "reject[ing defendant's] argument that the State was required to call an expert appraiser to establish value" of property). 
CONCLUSION
 
The "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" entered on
 
November 25, 2014, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is
 affirmed in part and vacated in part. The conviction and
 sentence for Unauthorized Entry into a Motor Vehicle in the First
 Degree is affirmed. The judgment entered on Counts 1 and 3 is
 vacated and the case is remanded to the Circuit Court. Within
 thirty days after entry of the judgment on appeal, the State
 shall notify the Circuit Court of its election between
 (1) dismissal of Count 1 or Count 3 or (2) retrial of Counts 1
 and 3 with a proper merger instruction.

 CW's testimony is consistent with the testimony of Hawai' i County

discovered that the laptop CW reported stolen had a value of "$291 andchange," although he testified that he could not recall what the change was.
