IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
JUVYLYN EA BANTOLINA, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
MARC B. BANTOLINA, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 10-1-6774)

 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this post-divorce decree proceeding, Plaintiff-

Appellant Juvylyn Ea Bantolina ("Mother") appeals from the
 
November 20, 2014 "Order Re: Motion and Declaration for Post-
Decree Relief, Filed July 21, 2014" ("November 20, 2014 Order")
 entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family
 
1/
Court"),  which directed Mother to reimburse Defendant-Appellee
Marc B. Bantolina ("Father") the amount of $10,164.00 for 44­months of child support payments Mother had received, with such
 amount to "be used towards the subject child's . . . educational
 expenses/costs."  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand
 
for entry of an order directing reimbursement of child support
 payments consistent with this opinion.
 
I. BACKGROUND

 
Mother and Father were married from March 1988 until
 
January 31, 2011. At the time of their divorce, the couple had
 one minor son, born July 19, 1995 ("Child"), whose financial

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
support is the subject of this action. The "Decree Granting
 
Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" ("Divorce Decree")
 reflects that Mother and Father were initially awarded joint
 legal and physical custody, and states, "It is the intention of
 the parties that the [Child] will spend equal time with the
 parties." The Divorce Decree ordered Father to pay $231.00 per
 month in child support to Mother, and states that such support
 
shall continue uninterrupted if said child continues his
education post high school on a full-time basis at an
 accredited college or university, or in a vocational or trade
school, and shall continue until said child's graduation or
attainment of the age of twenty-three (23) years, whichever
event shall first occur.
 
Notwithstanding the equal time sharing agreement, both parties
 
concede that the Child resided primarily with Father from the
 effective date of the divorce. Neither party appealed from the
 Divorce Decree.
 
On July 21, 2014, Father filed a "Motion and
 
Declaration for Post-Decree Relief" ("Motion"), which stated that
 the Child had been living with Father since January 31, 2011 and
 asked the Family Court to grant Father sole physical custody of
 the Child and to modify child support to require payments by
 Mother—rather than Father. The Motion also requested that Father
 be reimbursed for all of his past child support payments to
 Mother because, he argued, Mother did not apply that money
 towards the Child's expenses in accordance with the Divorce
 Decree. 
The Family Court heard the Motion on September 24,
 
2014. Although both parties were present, neither party
 testified, and Father's attorney failed to explain why his client
 waited over three years to file the Motion although the Child had
 apparently been residing with Father since the divorce. Rather,
 Father's attorney told the court: "We are not asking for past due
 child support. We are just asking for [Mother] to return what
 she collected wrongfully." 
Subsequently, the Family Court entered a post-decree
 
order on November 3, 2014 ("November 3, 2014 Order"), which
 granted Father sole legal and physical custody of the Child for
 child support purposes, terminated Father's child support

obligation as of July 21, 2014—the date of Father's Motion—and
 
ordered Mother to pay child support to Father once the
 Child—then, a 19-year-old part-time student—enrolled in college
 full-time. The request to have previously paid child support
 returned to Father was taken under advisement, and after
 considering the memoranda in support of and in opposition to the
 request, the Family Court issued its November 20, 2014 Order,
 ruling favorably on Father's request and ordered Mother to
 reimburse Father for forty-four months of child support payments
 (from January 2011 to September 2014) totaling $10,164.00. In
 support of its decision, the Family Court found that Mother
 "continued to fraudulently accept child support monies which were
 not used for the benefit of the minor child" and "failed to
 establish the defenses of laches and/or estoppel . . . ."
 
Mother timely filed her December 18, 2014 Notice of

 
Appeal from the November 20, 2014 Order, thereby giving this
 court jurisdiction to review both the November 3, 2014 Order and
 the November 20, 2014 Order. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 571–54 (2006), §
 641-1(a) (Supp. 2013).

(A) "The Family Court erred by retroactively modifying
Father's child support obligation beyond July 21, 2014,

Regulations [("C.F.R.")] 303.106 by permitting a child
support obligation to be retroactively modified";
 
(C) "The Family Court erred by awarding custody of an adult
in a Divorce case";
 
(D) "The Family Court erred by failing to timely file
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in this matter

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Family Court Decisions
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, [an
appellate court] will not disturb the family court's decisions
on appeal unless the family court disregarded rules or
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of
a party litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds
of reason.

(2012) (quoting Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 
355, 360 (2006)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse 
of discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai

'i 471, 474 n.5, 887 P.2d 1029, 1032 n.5 
(1995)) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
A. Order regarding Father's past child support payments
 
In Mother's first point of error, she claims that 
"[t]he Family Court erred by retroactively modifying Father's child support obligation beyond July 21, 2014, the date Father filed his [Motion]". Mother argues that modifications to child support obligations "must be entered as an order of the court" and that decisions from other jurisdictions demonstrate that divorce judgments including future support payments are final and thus, "'until [a requested] modification [to that judgment] has been ordered, the decree is entitled to enforcement as originally entered,' Dent v. Casaga . . , 208 N.W. 2d 734, 737 (1973) . . . ." Furthermore, she observes that Hawaii courts have held that child support orders "may not be modified retroactively." Vitali v. Hauen-Limkilde, No. 30405, 2012 WL 5288815, *1 (Hawai
'i 
App. Oct. 25, 2012) (citing Smith v. Smith, 3 Haw. App. 170, 174, 647 P.2d 722, 725 (1982); Lindsey v. Lindsey, 6 Haw. App. 201, 204, 716 P.2d 496, 499 (1986); Contra Costa Cty. ex rel. Tuazon v. Caro, 8 Haw. App. 341, 352, 802 P.2d 1212, 1217 (1990); State
 of Wash. ex rel. Gibson v. Gibson, 8 Haw. App. 304, 313, 800 P.2d

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1011, 1015 (1990)). We agree.
 
Payments made between July 2014 and September 2014
 
As a preliminary matter, we note that the Family
 
Court's decision to modify Father's child support obligation,
 
retroactive to the date Father filed his Motion, was proper. 
Indeed, under Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 580–47(d) (2006), 
Upon the motion of either party supported by an
affidavit setting forth in particular a material change in the
physical or financial circumstances of either party, or upon
a showing of other good cause, the moving party . . . may be
granted a hearing. . . . The court, upon such a hearing, for
good cause shown may amend or revise any order . . . .
 
Here, the Divorce Decree included an equal time-sharing agreement 
between Father and Mother that was, apparently, never followed. In his memorandum in support of the Motion, for example, Father states that the "[C]hild resided and continues to reside with [Father] and no equal time sharing between [Mother] and [Father] occurred from the effective date of the divorce." And in her declaration in response to the Motion, Mother similarly admits that "[the Child] has physically resided with [Father] since the date of the divorce on January 31, 2011 to present[ and the Child] would visit with [Mother] an average of twice a week." As such, the sums paid by Father to Mother were calculated under the Child Support Guidelines based on the assumption that the parties would share physical custody. These facts are sufficient to support the Family Court's decision to modify Father's child support obligation under HRS § 580–47(d)–but only back to the date Father filed his Motion. See DeMello v. DeMello, 87 Hawai
'i 
209, 213-14, 953 P.2d 968, 972-73 (App. 1998) (noting that HRS § 580–47(d) "requires a party requesting a change in child support to allege and prove a change in circumstances[,]" and holding that the court did not err "when it ordered the support obligation to be retroactive to . . . the date of the filing of the motion to amend child support"); see also Sussman v. Sussman, No. 30407, 2013 WL 6472277, at *3 (Hawai
'i App. Dec. 10, 2013) 
(noting that "family courts are afforded wide discretion with respect to a modification based on a material change in circumstance" (citations omitted)). Thus, we affirm the Family 
5
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court's November 20, 2014 Order to the extent that it directed
 
Mother to reimburse Father for the child support payments she
 received between July 21, 2014 (the filing date of the Motion)
 and September 24, 2014 (the date of the hearing on the Motion). 
Section 580–47(d) cannot, however, be used to modify Father's
 child support obligation prior to the date that Father filed his
 Motion.
 
Payments made between January 2011 and July 2014
 
In its March 13, 2015 Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law ("FOF/COL"), the Family Court directly cited HRS § 580–47(d) as establishing its authority to order Mother to reimburse Father for all 44-months of past child support payments. However, HRS § 580–47 applies only to prospective awards—and it only serves to affect something retroactively insofar as courts often hold that the amended child support obligation becomes effective retroactively to the date on which the moving party filed his or her motion. E.g., DeMello, 87 
Hawai
'i at 214, 953 P.2d at 973 (holding that the court did not 
err "when it ordered the support obligation to be retroactive to . . . the date of the filing of the motion to amend child support"); Richardson, 8 Haw. App. at 459, 808 P.2d at 1288 (holding that "[f]ather is liable for the difference between what he should have been paying . . . commencing [on the date of mother's motion] and what he actually paid for that period of time"). Therefore, the Family Court erred in awarding reimbursement for 44-months of past child support payments under HRS § 580-47(d). 
In order to modify any obligation prior to the date of 
the motion requesting modification, a party must invoke Rule 60 of the Hawai
'i Family Court Rules ("HFCR"). Lindsey, 6 Haw. App. 
at 204, 716 P.2d at 499 ("[C]ourt-ordered child support payments may be modified prospectively but not retroactively . . . , except pursuant to Rule 60, Hawaii Family Court Rules (1982)." (emphasis added) (citing Smith, 3 Haw. App. 170, 647 P.2d 722)). Under HFCR Rule 60(b), "[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
representative from any or all of the provisions of a final
 
judgment, order, or proceeding" for a variety of reasons,
 including "(3) fraud . . . misrepresentation, or other misconduct
 of an adverse party[,]" or "(6) any other reason justifying
 relief from the operation of the judgment." Haw. Fam. Ct. R.
 60(b)(3) & (b)(6). Because Father did not base his argument on
 Rule 60(b), however, he is not entitled to relief under the rule.
 
Therefore, we reverse the November 20, 2014 Order to
 
the extent that it directed Mother to reimburse Father for child
 support payments that she received between January 31, 2011 (the
 date of the Divorce Decree) and July 21, 2014 (the filing date of
 Father's Motion).
 
B.	 C.F.R. 303.106 & retroactive modification of child
 
support
 
Mother's second argument on appeal is that the Family
 
Court violated C.F.R. 303.106 when it retroactively modified
 
Father's child support obligation beyond the date of his Motion.
 Since we have already determined that the Family Court abused its
 discretion in ordering Mother to reimburse Father for child
 support payments collected between the date of the Divorce Decree
 up to the date of Father's Motion, we need not address the merits
 of Mother's second point of error.
 
C.	 Order modifying custody of an adult child
 
The November 3, 2014 Order awarded Father "sole legal
 
and physical custody of [Child] for child support purposes." 
Mother contends that the Family Court plainly erred when it
 awarded custody of the 19-year-old Child to Father, because the
 Family Court did not have jurisdiction to award physical custody
 of any child who exceeded 18 years of age. Mother's argument
 ignores the effect and purpose of the court's order, to require
 Mother to pay support for the Child's college education, and thus
 is inapposite.
 
Nothing that Mother points to imposes an age limit on
 
the family courts' ability to order parties to provide financial
 support for an adult child's education. Indeed, under HRS § 580­
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
47, "[p]rovision may be made for the support, maintenance, and 
education of an adult or minor child and for the support, maintenance, and education of an incompetent adult child whether or not the petition is made before or after the child has attained the age of majority." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 580–47(a) (emphasis added). And although family courts "shall use the guidelines established under [HRS] section 576D–7" when "establishing the amounts of child support," Haw. Rev. Stat. § 580–47(a), the Hawai
'i Supreme Court has explicitly held that 
"th[ose] guidelines were intended to establish the amount of child support rather than to establish the child's eligibility for such support." Jaylo v. Jaylo, 125 Hawai
'i 369, 375, 262 
P.3d 245, 251 (2011) ("To the extent that the 2004 Guidelines purport to set an age limitation of 23 on the family court's authority to continue educational support for an adult child, they are invalid as they exceed the statutory mandate of HRS § 580–47(a) when they purport to limit eligibility for such support."). 
In the instant dispute, the Divorce Decree stated that: 

[c]hild support for each child shall continue uninterrupted if
said child continues his education post high school on a full-
time basis at an accredited college or university, or in a
vocational or trade school, and shall  continue until said
 
child's  graduation or attainment of the age of twenty three
(23) years, whichever event shall first occur.
 
The orders Mother contests on appeal did not alter the Divorce
 
Decree's educational support provision. In fact, the November
 03, 2014 Order specifies that "[c]ommencement of child support
 obligation against [Mother] shall begin when [the Child] enrolls
 full time in college in keeping with the Decree." As Mother does
 not argue that HRS § 580–47(a) is unconstitutional, and because
 the parties stipulated to the Family Court's custody order,
 Mother's arguments on this point of error are inapposite. 
Thus, the Family Court did not exceed its jurisdiction
 
or otherwise err when it awarded "physical custody" of the then
 19-year-old Child to Father for the purposes of determining child
 support obligations.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D. Tardy issuing of requested FOFs/COLs and transcripts
 
Mother claims that her rights were violated because the
 
Family Court did not timely file FOFs and COLs and because a
 
court reporter did not timely file a requested transcript. 
Mother reserved the right in her opening brief to supplement her
 brief after the FOFs, COLs, and transcript were filed; however,
 she did not seek to supplement her brief after those documents
 were filed. Mother has not demonstrated any undue prejudice from
 the untimely filing of these documents or an entitlement to any
 additional relief based on their late filing.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the November 3, 2014 Order is
 
affirmed. The November 20, 2014 "Order Re: Motion and
 
Declaration for Post-Decree Relief, Filed July 21, 2014" is
 reversed to the extent that it awards reimbursement of child
 support payments made by Father to Mother prior to July 21, 2014,
 and is otherwise affirmed. The case is remanded to the Family
 Court for entry of an order directing reimbursement to Father for
 any child support payments he made since July 21, 2014, the date
 of his Motion.
