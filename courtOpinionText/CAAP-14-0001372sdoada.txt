IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JASON S. KING, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 2DCW-13-0002724)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) charged 
Defendant-Appellant Jason S. King (King) with intentionally or 
knowingly violating an injunction against harassment, a violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 604-10.5 (Supp. 2014).
1 The 
charged offense is a misdemeanor and a person convicted of the offense may be subject to imprisonment for up to one year. Id.; 
HRS ยง 706-663 (2014). Accordingly, King had a right to trial by jury. See State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. 118, 120, 857 P.2d 576, 577 
(1993); HRS ยง 806-60 (2014) (establishing a right to trial by jury for any crime for which the defendant may be imprisoned for six months or more). 
1HRS ยง 604-10.5 provides in relevant part: "(i) A knowing or
intentional violation of a restraining order or injunction issued
pursuant to this section is a misdemeanor." 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
King did not waive his right to trial by jury either
 
orally or in writing. Nevertheless, he was tried without a jury
 
in a bench trial before the District Court of the Second Circuit
 (District Court). The District Court found King guilty as
 charged, sentenced him to pay a fine of $100, and filed its
 Judgment on November 21, 2014.
 
King appeals from the District Court's Judgment. On
 
appeal, King argues that he did not validly waive his right to
 trial by jury, and therefore, the District Court erred in holding
 a bench trial in this case.
2 The State concedes error and
 
requests that King's conviction be vacated and the case be
 remanded for a new trial.
 
We agree with the parties that King did not validly 
waive his right to a trial by jury. See Ibuos, 75 Haw. at 121, 
857 P.2d at 578 ("A knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to trial by jury must come directly from a defendant, either in writing or orally."); HRS ยง 806-61 (2014) ("The defendant in any criminal case may, with the consent of the court, waive the right to a trial by jury either by written consent filed in court or by oral consent in open court entered on the minutes."); Hawai
'i 
Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 5(b)(3) (2012) ("In appropriate cases, the defendant shall be tried by jury in the circuit court unless the defendant waives in writing or orally in open court the right to trial by jury."). Therefore, the District Court violated King's right to trial by jury by holding a bench trial in this case, and King's conviction cannot stand. See Ibuos 75 
Haw. at 119-23, 857 P.2d at 577-79 (holding that the trial court's failure to obtain a valid waiver of the defendant's right to a jury trial required vacating the trial court's judgment and remanding the case for a new trial). 
2The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided over the
relevant pre-trial proceedings in this case and the Honorable
Kirstin M. Hamman presided over King's bench trial.
