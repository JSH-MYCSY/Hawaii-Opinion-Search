IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
HAWAII PAROLING AUTHORITY, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 14-1-0003(2); CR. NO. 96-0078(2))
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS
 
FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
 
Jurisdiction by Respondent-Appellee Hawaii Paroling Authority,
 
filed on February 25, 2015, the attachments thereto, and the
 files herein, it appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction
 over the appeal because there is no final appealable judgment or
 order. On November 25, 2014, the circuit court issues its
 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying
 Petitioners Non-Conforming HRPP Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set
 Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody
 which denied Petitioner-Appellant Gerald Villanueva's (Appellant)
 May 8, 2014 Writ of Habeas Corpus, which was deemed a non­conforming petition, pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules of
 Penal Procedure (HRPP). On December 16, 2014, the circuit court
 granted Appellant's Motion for Reconsideration and vacated the

November 25, 2014 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Judgment Denying Petitioners Non-Conforming HRPP Rule 40 Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai
'i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). As Appellant's motion for reconsideration was granted, at the time Appellant filed an appeal, there was no final appealable judgment or order from which to appeal. Therefore, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss for
 
Lack of Jurisdiction is granted. The appeal is dismissed for
 lack of appellate jurisdiction.
