NO. CAAP-14-0001386
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
TODD ATHERTON PERKINS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TAMMY ASH PERKINS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 11-1-0086)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Tammy Ash
 
Perkins's (Appellant Tammy Perkins) appeal in appellate court
 case number CAAP-14-0001386 from the Honorable Lloyd A. Poelman's
 November 26, 2014 post-judgment order denying Appellant Tammy
 Perkins's November 24, 2014 post-judgment motion for court-
appointed counsel, because the November 26, 2014 post-judgment
 order is not a final order appealable under Hawaii Revised
 Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006).
 
"An interested party, aggrieved by any order or decree
 
of the court, may appeal to the intermediate appellate court for
 review of questions of law and fact upon the same terms and
 conditions as in other cases in the circuit court[.]" HRS § 571­54. In circuit court cases, aggrieved parties may appeal from
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"final judgments, orders or decrees[.]" HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2014). In light of the family court's prior entry of the September 26, 2012 divorce decree in this case, the instant case involves a post-judgment proceeding for Plaintiff-Appellee Todd Atherton Perkins's (Appellee Todd Perkins) September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief regarding various visitation issues. "A post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order finally determines the post-judgment proceeding." Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai
'i 105, 111 n.4, 26 
P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 2001) (citation omitted), affirmed in part, and vacated in part on other grounds, Hall v. Hall, 95 Hawai
'i 318, 22 P.3d 965 (2001). In other words, "[a] post-
judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). "Correlatively, an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Id. (citation 
omitted). 
In the instant case, the family court has utilized
 
multiple post-judgment orders to adjudicate multiple issues
 during the post-judgment proceeding for Appellee Todd Perkins's
 September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief regarding various
 visitation issues. The family court entered an October 1, 2014
 post-judgment order to adjudicate some, but not all, of the
 issues in Appellee Todd Perkins's September 8, 2014 motion for
 post-decree relief, but, in paragraphs 5 and 6 on page 4 of that
 October 1, 2014 post-judgment order, the family court expressly
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
directs the parties to participate in mediation regarding certain
 
remaining issues, and the family court scheduled a hearing
 regarding the mediation for March 30, 2015. The subject of this
 appeal, namely the November 26, 2014 post-judgment order denying
 Appellant Tammy Perkins's November 24, 2014 post-judgment motion
 for court-appointed counsel, is just one post-judgment order in
 the series of multiple post-judgment orders that the family court
 is utilizing to adjudicate the various issues in Appellee Todd
 Perkins's September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief. The
 October 1, 2014 post-judgment order and the November 26, 2014
 post-judgment order would become eligible for appellate review by
 way of a timely appeal from the family court's post-judgment
 order that finally determines the remaining issues and ends this
 post-judgment proceeding, based on the principle that,
 
where the disposition of the case is embodied in several
orders, no one of which embraces the entire controversy but
collectively does so, it is a necessary inference from 54(b)
that the orders collectively constitute a final judgment and
entry of the last of the series of orders gives finality and
appealability to all.
 
S. Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 75 Haw. 
480, 494-95, 866 P.2d 951, 960 (1994) (citations, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis points omitted). When the family court enters a final post-judgment order that finally determines the remaining issues of Appellee Todd Perkins's September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief, then a timely appeal from that post-judgment order would entitle an aggrieved party to assert a timely appeal for the review of the entire series of post-judgment orders in this post-judgment proceeding. Cook v. Surety 
Life Insurance Company, 79 Hawai
'i 403, 409, 903 P.2d 708, 714 
(App. 1995) (citations omitted); see also Riethbrock v. Lange, 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
128 Hawai 'i 1, 17, 282 P.3d 543, 560 (2012). The record on 
appeal does not contain a post-judgment order that finally 
determines the remaining issues of Appellee Todd Perkins's September 8, 2014 motion for post-decree relief. Absent an appealable post-judgment order, Appellant Tammy Perkins's appeal in appellate court case number CAAP-14-0001386 is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
The November 26, 2014 post-judgment order denying
 
Appellant Tammy Perkins's November 24, 2014 post-judgment motion
 for court-appointed counsel does not satisfy all three
 requirements of the collateral order doctrine for appealability. 
Cf. Gomes v. Kauwe’s Heirs, 52 Haw. 126, 127, 472 P.2d 119, 120
 (1970) (holding than an order denying a motion to disqualify
 counsel does not qualify for appealability under the collateral
 order doctrine); Chuck v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 61
 Haw. 552, 556-57, 606 P.2d at 1323-24 (1980) (holding that a
 motion granting a motion to disqualify counsel does not qualify
 for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
CAAP-14-0001386 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
