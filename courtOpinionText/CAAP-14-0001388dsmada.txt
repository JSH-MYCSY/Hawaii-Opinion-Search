NO. CAAP-14-0001388
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
PATRICK T. MASAOKA, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 14-1-0005; CRIMINAL NOS. 05-1-2738; 06-1-0675)
 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Petitioner-Appellant Patrick T. 
Masaoka (Appellant Masaoka) has asserted from the Honorable Steven S. Alm's November 3, 2014 order denying Appellant Masaoka's petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) because the appeal 
is untimely under Rule 4(b) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP). 
"[P]ursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order 
denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within thirty days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement but before the entry of the order." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). Under similar circumstances, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that, when a pro se 
prisoner attempts to assert an appeal, the "notice of appeal is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deemed filed for purposes of Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a) on the day it is tendered to prison officials by 
a pro se prisoner." Setala v. J.C. Penney Company, 97 Hawai 'i 
484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the instant case, HRAP Rule 4(b) provides the controlling time period for filing a notice of appeal rather than HRAP Rule 4(a), but the holding in Setala v. J.C. Penney Company applies to the instant case. Although the electronic date on Appellant Masaoka's notice of appeal is December 26, 2014, Appellant Masaoka appears to have tendered his notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing on December 10, 2014, and, thus, the controlling date is December 10, 2014. Nevertheless, contrary to the thirty-day time limitation under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1), Appellant Masaoka did not tender his December 10, 2014 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the November 3, 2014 order denying Appellant Masaoka's HRPP 40 petition for post-conviction relief. Therefore, Appellant Masaoka's appeal is not timely. 
"In criminal cases, [the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i] 
ha[s] made exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be timely filed." State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai
'i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 
236, 239 (1998). Specifically, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has 
permitted belated appeals under two sets of circumstances: 
(1) [when] defense counsel has inexcusably or
ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant’s
appeal from a criminal conviction in the fist
instance, or (2) [when] the lower court’s decision
was unannounced and no notice of the entry of
judgment was ever provided.
 
Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai
'i at 13-14, 897 P.2d at 940­
41 (citations omitted). These two exceptions do not apply to the 
instant case because (1) this case is not Appellant Masaoka's appeal from his criminal conviction in the first instance and (2) the circuit court clearly announced its decision by filing
 the November 3, 2014 order denying Appellant Masaoka's HRPP
 Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief. Appellant Masaoka's
 appeal is not timely. "As a general rule, compliance with the
 requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
jurisdictional, . . . and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion 
if we lack jurisdiction." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai 'i at 
13, 897 P.2d at 940 (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."); HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."). 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001388 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in CAAP-14-0001388 are dismissed as moot.
