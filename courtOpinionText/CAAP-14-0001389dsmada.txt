DIRECTING THE APPELLATE COURT CLERK TO OPEN A NEW APPELLATE
 
COURT CASE FOR APPELLANTS' MAY 8, 2015 NOTICE OF APPEAL FROM

AN APRIL 15, 2015 JUDGMENT ON A DECREE OF FORECLOSURE
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over appellate court case number CAAP-14­
0001389 regarding Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Third-Party
 Plaintiffs/Appellants James Joseph Franco and Edna Ardales
 Franco's (the Franco Appellants) appeal from the Honorable Greg
 K. Nakamura's November 24, 2014 interlocutory order dismissing
 parts of the Franco Appellants' January 2, 2014 counterclaim and
 third-party complaint, because the circuit court has not yet
 reduced the November 24, 2014 interlocutory dismissal order to a
 separate judgment.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 641-1(a) (1993 & 
Supp. 2014) authorizes appeals to the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court 
of Appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
"Thus, based on Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. 
One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008); 
Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai 'i 14, 20, 122 
P.3d 809, 815 (2005) ("[A]n order disposing of a circuit court 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate 
judgment." (Citation omitted; emphasis added)). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339 (footnote omitted). 
On February 24, 2015, the circuit court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal, and on March 23, 2015, the circuit court clerk
 filed the amended record on appeal, but neither of these records
 on appeal contains a judgment on the claims that the November 24,
 2014 interlocutory dismissal order resolved. The November 24,
 2014 interlocutory dismissal order will not be eligible for
 appellate review until the circuit court reduces the November 24,
 2014 interlocutory dismissal order to a proper separate judgment
 on those particular claims. Absent an appealable final judgment
 as to the November 24, 2014 interlocutory dismissal order, we
 lack appellate jurisdiction, and the Franco Appellants' appeal is
 premature.
 
We note that on May 8, 2015, the Franco Appellants
 
filed herein a second notice of appeal from an April 15, 2015
 judgment on a decree of foreclosure as to Plaintiff/Counterclaim­Defendant/Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for
 the LXS 2006-16N's complaint for foreclosure. Although the April
 15, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure is independently
 appealable under HRS § 667-51(a)(1) (Supp. 2014), the April 15,
 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure does not cure our lack
 of appellate jurisdiction in CAAP-14-0001389 to review the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
November 24, 2014 interlocutory dismissal order, because the 
April 15, 2015 judgment on the decree of foreclosure does not enter judgment on any of the claims that the November 24, 2014 interlocutory dismissal order resolves. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-14-0001389 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED as follows:
 (1) Within ten (10) days after entry of this order, the
 
appellate court clerk shall:
 
(A) Electronically file the May 8, 2015 notice of
 
appeal that the Franco Appellants filed in appellate court case
 number CAAP-14-0001389 and open a new appellate court case number
 for the Franco Appellants' separate appeal from the Circuit Court
 of the Third Circuit's April 15, 2015 judgment on a decree of
 foreclosure in Civil No. 13-1-0627;
 
(B) File a copy of this order in the new appellate
 
court case; and
 
(C) Serve a copy of this order on the clerk of the
 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.
 
(2) The clerk of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
shall file the record on appeal for Civil No. 13-1-0627 in the new appellate court case in the time and manner consistent with Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 11(b)(1). 
(3) The clerk of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 
shall, in light of Judge Reifurth's December 21, 2014 order
 granting the Franco Appellants' December 26, 2014 request to
 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
proceed in forma pauperis in appellate court case number CAAP-14­
0001389 (of which this court takes judicial notice), file the
 record on appeal for Civil No. 13-1-0627 in the new appellate
 court case without requiring any prepayment of any filing or
 docketing fee.
 
(4) The parties in the new appellate court case shall
 
file their respective appellate briefs in accordance with HRAP
 Rule 28.
