(By:

In this consolidated appeal, Defendant-Appellant Louis
 
Lance Palama (Palama) appeals from the (1) Judgment/Order and
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order in 5DTC-13-000343 (CAAP-14­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

 of Entry of Judgment/Order in 5DTC-14-000971 (CAAP-15-0000350),
 filed on March 19, 2015, and (4) Judgment/Order and Notice of
 Entry of Judgment/Order in 5DTC-14-001172 (CAAP-15-0000351),
 entered on March 19, 2015, in the District Court of the Fifth
 Circuit (District Court).
 
In 5DTC-13-000343, Palama was convicted of Driving
 
Without a License in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 286-102 (Supp. 2013).
1 In 5DTC-13-002816, Palama was convicted
 
of Driving Without a License in violation of HRS § 286-102.2 In
 
5DTC-14-000971, Palama was convicted of Driving Without a License
 in violation of HRS § 286-102 (Supp. 2014) and No No-Fault
 Insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a)(2005). In 5DTC­14-001172, Palama was convicted of Driving Without a License in
 violation of HRS § 286-102 (Supp. 2014) and No No-Fault Insurance
 in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104(a).
 
On appeal, Palama contends (1) the District Court 
lacked jurisdiction to hear all four of these cases because Palama is a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i and the Kingdom of 
Hawai'i still exists, (2) all charges for Driving Without a 
License failed to state an essential element of the charge, that Palama was driving on a public or private road, (3) the District Court erred by taking judicial notice that the location of the offenses were public roads, (4) in 5DTC-13-000343 he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel did not request nominal bail be set so that he could receive pre-sentence credit for time served, (5) in 5DTC-13-000343 his right to due process was violated when he was forced to commence with trial without an attorney, and (6) in 5DTC-13-002816, 5DTC-14-000971, and 5DTC-14­001172 there was insufficient evidence to prove that Palama was

the driver of the vehicle.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Palama's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Palama's claim that the District Court lacked 
jurisdiction to hear all of the cases because he is a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i is without merit. State v. Kaulia, 128 
Hawai'i 479, 486-87, 291 P.3d 377, 384-85 (2013). 
(2) Palama's claim that the charges for Driving Without
 
a License in violation of HRS § 286-102 failed to state an

 
essential element of the charge, i.e. driving on a public or
 private road, is without merit. HRS § 286-102(a), defining the
 offense of Driving Without a License, states:

 
No person, except one exempted under section 286-105,
one who holds an instruction permit under section
286-110, one who holds a provisional license under
section 286-102.6, one who holds a commercial driver's
license issued under section 286-239, or one who holds
a commercial driver's license instruction permit
issued under section 286-236, shall operate any
category of motor vehicles listed in this section
without first being appropriately examined and duly
licensed as a qualified driver of that category of
motor vehicles.
 
The plain language of HRS § 286-102(a) does not limit the offense 
of driving without a license to public roads. State v. 
Kelekolio, 94 Hawai 'i 354, 356-61, 14 P.3d 364, 366-71 (App. 
2000). The statute prohibits operating a motor vehicle without being appropriately examined and duly licensed. Id. Thus, it 
prohibits driving without a license within the State of Hawai
'i. 
The charges against Palama for Driving Without a License stated that the offenses were committed within the County of Kaua
'i, 
State of Hawai 'i. Therefore, the charges did not omit an 
essential element of the offense by failing to specify that the offenses occurred on a public or private road. 
The complaints charging No No-Fault Insurance were not
 
defective. HRS § 431:10C-104 (emphasis added) states that "no
 person shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public
 street, road, or highway of this State at any time unless such
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motor vehicle is insured at all times under a motor vehicle
 
insurance policy." Therefore, the charge would have been
 defective had it included the term "or private" to modify the
 type of street, road, or highway, as argued by Palama.
 
(3) The District Court did not err by taking judicial
 
notice that the locations where Palama operated or used a vehicle
 was a public street, road, or highway. As stated above, Driving
 Without a License in violation of HRS § 286-102 does not require
 proof that the offense occurred on a public road, street, or
 highway. Thus, Palama's claim that it was improper for the
 District Court to take judicial notice that the locations where
 Palama operated a vehicle were public streets, roads, or highways
 is only applicable to 5DTC-14-000971 and 5DTC-14-001172 in which
 he was convicted for violating HRS § 431:10C-104(a).
 
HRS § 431:10C-104 states:
 
§431:10C-104. Conditions of operation and
registration of motor vehicles. (a) Except as
provided in section 431:10C-105, no person shall
operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public street,
road, or highway of this State at any time unless such
motor vehicle is insured at all times under a motor
 vehicle insurance policy.
 
Rule 201(b) of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence states:
 
(b) Kinds of facts. A judicially noticed fact must
be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is
either (1) generally known within the territorial
jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate
and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy
cannot reasonably be questioned.
 
"The motor vehicle laws were brought within [HRS] 
Chapter 431 in an effort to consolidate all the insurance laws 
into one chapter." TIG Ins. Co. v. Kauhane, 101 Hawai 'i 311, 
325, 67 P.3d 810, 824 (App. 2003). The terms "public," "street," "road," and "highway" are not defined in HRS Chapter 431:10C. Thus, whether a "public street, road, or highway" must be owned by the government or merely open to the public is not specified in the statute. "Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another." Id. at 322, 67 P.3d at 821 (quoting State 
v. Rauch, 94 Hawai
'i 315, 322, 13 P.3d 324, 331 (2000)). Thus, 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
we may look to HRS Chapter 286 to aid in our interpretation of
 
the meaning of "public street, road, or highway."
 
Highway means "the entire width between the boundary
 
lines of every way publicly maintained when any part thereof is
 open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel." 
HRS § 286-2 (2007). The State of Hawaii, Department of
 Transportation lists Kaumualii Highway, from the intersection of
 Kuhio Highway/Rice Street to Lio Road, as a road under the
 jurisdiction of the State of Hawaii, Highways Division. 
http://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/home/kauai/kauai-state-roads­and-highways (last visited June 24, 2016). The highway, from the
 intersection of Kuhio Highway/Rice Street to Lio Road is the
 entirety of Kaumualii Highway. "The department of transportation
 shall acquire, subdivide, consolidate, construct, maintain, and
 administer all highways comprising the state highway system in
 accordance with all state and federal laws and exempt from county
 subdivision ordinances." HRS § 264-43. Therefore, judicial
 notice that Kaumualii Highway is a public highway was proper. 
The terms "public," "street," and "road" are not 
defined in HRS Chapter 286. This court "may confirm the ordinary meaning of statutory terms by resort [sic] to extrinsic aids, such as dictionaries and our case law." State v. Kalani, 108 
Hawai
'i 279, 284, 118 P.3d 1222, 1227 (2005) (citation omitted). 
The term "public" is defined as "[o]pen to common or general use; as, a public road; a public house." Webster's Dictionary, http://www.webster-dictionary.net/definition/public (last visited June 22, 2016). A "street" is "a paved way or road; a public highway; now commonly, a thoroughfare in a city or village, bordered by dwellings or business houses." Webster's Dictionary, http://www.webster-dictionary.net/definition/street (last visited June 22, 2016). Finally, a "road" is understood to refer to "[a] place where one may ride; an open way or public passage for vehicles, persons, and animals; a track for travel, forming a means of communication between one city, town, or place, and another." Webster's Dictionary, http://www.webster­dictionary.net/definition/road (last visited June 22, 2016). Thus, for purposes of HRS § 431:10C-104, a "public street, road, or highway" includes any place open to the general public for 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
purposes of vehicular traffic. Such a broad interpretation is 
consistent with the purpose of HRS Chapter 431:10C.3
 
The fact that Papalina Road and Lele Road are open to 
the general public for the purpose of vehicular traffic is "generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court," and, thus, not subject to reasonable dispute. Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 201(b)(1). Therefore, judicial notice that Palama was observed operating a vehicle on a "public street, road, or highway," was proper. See State v. Rivera, 128 Hawai
'i 
311, 288 P.3d 129, 2012 WL 4344185 (App. 2012) (SDO), vacated on other grounds, 131 Hawai
'i 300, 318 P.3d 590 (2014) (SDO) 
(rejecting Rivera's argument that evidence supporting his conviction for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant was insufficient where the trial court took judicial notice Rivera drove on a public way, street, road, or highway). 
(4) Palama did not receive ineffective assistance of
 
counsel when his counsel failed to request bail in 5DTC-13-000343
 so that he could receive pre-sentence credit for time served. 
Palama was not incarcerated due to the charges in 5DTC-13-000343. 
Instead, he was issued a citation and summons. Thus, Palama
 
3	 HRS § 431:10C-102 states:
 
§431:10C-102 Purpose.  (a) The purpose of this
article is to:
 
(1)	 Create a system of reparations for accidental
harm and loss arising from motor vehicle
accidents;
 
(2)	 Compensate these damages without regard to
fault; and
 
(3)	 Limit tort liability for these accidents.
 
(b) To effectuate this system of motor vehicle
insurance and to encourage participation by all drivers in
the motor vehicle insurance system:
 
(1)	 Those uninsured drivers who try to obtain the
privilege of driving a motor vehicle without the
concomitant responsibility of an ability to
compensate adequately those who are injured as a
result of a motor vehicle accident are to be
 dealt with more severely in the criminal or
civil areas than those who obtain the legally
required motor vehicle insurance coverage;
 
(2)	 Those persons truly economically unable to
afford insurance are provided for under the
public assistance provisions of this article.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
could not post bail for a charge for which he was not 
incarcerated. In addition, Palama admits that he was incarcerated due to another, unrelated charge. Thus, Palama could not receive pre-sentence credit for a pending charge while he was incarcerated for another unrelated charge. HRS § 706­671(3) (Supp. 2015); State v. Yamasaki, 91 Hawai
'i 163, 166, 981 
P.2d 720, 723 (App. 1999) ("[The] purpose of HRS § 706-671(1) is to credit a defendant for the time he or she is confined prior to sentencing in connection with the defendant's ultimate conviction." (citation omitted)). 
(5) Palama's right to due process was violated when
 
there was not a proper waiver of his right to an attorney in
 5DTC-13-000343. 
Although Palama may have waived his right to court-
appointed counsel on August 6, 2014, on October 2, 2014, when Palama appeared for trial without counsel, no colloquy regarding or explicit waiver of his right to counsel was conducted or taken before trial. As a valid waiver of Palama's right to counsel was not taken, we must vacate his conviction as to case 5DTC-13­000343. See State v. Akina, 121 Hawai
'i 472, 220 P.3d 1053, 2009 
WL 4726630 (App. 2009) (SDO). 
(6) There was sufficient evidence to prove that Palama
 
was the driver of a vehicle in 5DTC-13-002816, 5DTC-14-000971,
 and 5DTC-14-001172. When the evidence adduced in the trial court
 is considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, State
 v. Matavale, 115 Hawai
'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007), there was substantial evidence that Palama was the driver in each of those cases. 
In 5DTC-13-002816, Officer Broad identified Palama in
 
court and testified that on September 8, 2013, at approximately
 2:00 p.m., he first observed Palama on Papalina Road as Palama was driving a pickup truck. After he stopped Palama, Palama could not produce a valid Hawai
'i State driver's license, motor 
vehicle insurance, or registration. 
In 5DTC-14-000971, Officer Lester identified Palama in 
court and testified that on March 31, 2014, at approximately 1:04 p.m., he stopped Palama, who was driving a brown Ford pickup truck and could not provide him with a Hawai
'i State driver's 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
license, registration, or proof of insurance.
 
In 5DTC-14-001172, Officer Melcher identified Palama in 
court and testified that on April 18, 2014, at approximately 9:20 
a.m., he observed Palama driving a brown Ford F-150 on Papalina Road, near Medeiros Farms, and after stopping Palama, Palama could not produce a valid Hawai
'i State driver's license or motor 
vehicle insurance. 
In each of these cases, the officer's testimony was
 
substantial evidence that Palama was the driver of the vehicle
 that was stopped.
 Based on the foregoing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
 
(1) Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order in 5DTC­13-000343 (CAAP-14-0001391) entered on November 25, 2014 is
 vacated and this case is remanded for further proceedings. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the (2) Amended Judgment and
 
Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment in 5DTC-13-002816 (CAAP-15­0000349) filed on April 17, 2015, (3) Judgment/Order and Notice
 of Entry of Judgment/Order in 5DTC-14-000971 (CAAP-15-0000350),

 Entry of Judgment/Order in 5DTC-14-001172 (CAAP-15-0000351),
