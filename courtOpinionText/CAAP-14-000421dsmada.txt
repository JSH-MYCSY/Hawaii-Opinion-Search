(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-Upon consideration of the “Association of Apartment
Owners of Kulana’s Response to Fourth Report on Status on [sic]
Settlement Filed on October 17, 2016,” filed October 18, 2016, by
Association of Apartment Owners of Kulana (AOAO of Kulana), the
“Stipulation for Dismissal With Prejudice as to All Claims and
All Parties,” filed November 10, 2016, by Travelers Casualty and
Surety Company of America (Travelers), the papers in support and
in response, and the record, it appears that:
(1) On September 28, 2015, the court temporarily
remanded appeal numbers CAAP-14-0000421, CAAP-14-0000437 and
CAAP-14-0000507 to the circuit court for 180 days so the parties
could pursue actions to effectuate a proposed settlement
agreement; 
(2) The court subsequently extended the temporary
remand three times.  On September 19, 2016, the court extended
the temporary remand to October 26, 2016, subject to further
court order, and ordered the parties to file a motion or
stipulation to dismiss the appeals by October 14, 2016, or file a
status report on or before October 17, 2016;
(3) On October 17, 2016, Travelers filed a status
report indicating the circuit court in the underlying case, Civil
No. 12-1-0027, approved the class settlement on September 14,
2016;
(4) On October 18, 2016, the AOAO filed a response, and
requested the court to extend the temporary remand an additional
thirty days;
(5) On October 20, 2016, Travelers filed a reply, and
joined the AOAO’s request for an extension of the temporary
remand;
(6) Because the parties failed to demonstrate that any
further action is contemplated or required by the circuit court
in the underlying case, an extension of the temporary remand is
unnecessary;
(7) Pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP) Rule 42(b), the parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal
with prejudice, and bear their own costs and attorneys' fees on
appeal;NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-(8) The stipulation is dated and signed by counsel for
all parties appearing in the appeal; 
(9) The appeal has not been docketed; and 
(10) HRAP Rule 42(b) governs dismissal of docketed
appeals, whereas HRAP Rule 42(a) authorizes dismissal before an
appeal is docketed.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the AOAO’s 
October 18, 2016 request to extend the temporary remand is
denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the stipulation to dismiss
the appeal is approved in part and the appeal is dismissed with
prejudice, pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(a).  The parties shall bear
their own costs and attorneys' fees on appeal.  The court takes
no position on the stipulation terms concerning the so-called
“Collateral Agreement,” and Judge Gail Nakatani’s (Ret.)
