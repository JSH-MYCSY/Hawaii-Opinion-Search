                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

 

 

 

 
NO.

(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

appeals from the December 9, 2014 Judgment (Judgment) entered in

 February 12, 2013 order granting BOA's motion to dismiss Reyes­Toledo's counterclaims (Dismissal Order), or (2) the Circuit 
Court's December 31, 2013 order denying reconsideration of the 
Dismissal Order (Order Denying Reconsideration). Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, No. CAAP-15-0000005, 2016 WL 1092305 (Haw. App. Mar. 16, 2016) (SDO). On grant of certiorari, the Hawai
'i Supreme Court vacated the ICA's Judgment on Appeal 
and, inter alia, remanded the case to the ICA for a determination of whether the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Reyes-Toledo's counterclaims. Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawai
'i 361, 390 P.3d 1248 (2017). 
Reyes-Toledo, in her remaining points of error (E & F), 
contends that the Circuit Court reversibly erred (1) when it entered the Dismissal Order, which dismissed her counterclaims for wrongful foreclosure, declaratory judgment, quiet title, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP), pursuant to Hawai
'i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6), and (2) when it 
entered the Order Denying Reconsideration. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Reyes-Toledo's remaining points of error as follows:
 
Pursuant to HRCP Rule 8(a), a "pleading which sets
 
 
forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim,
 
 
counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain
 
 
(1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the
 
 
pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for
 
 
2
 



 


 





 


 
















 

 the relief the pleader seeks." Moreover, the pleading "must
 
 
contain either direct allegations on every material point
 
 
necessary to sustain a recovery on any legal theory, even though
 
 
it may not be the theory suggested or intended by the pleader, or
 
 
contain allegations from which an inference fairly may be drawn
 
 
that evidence on these material points will be introduced at
 
 
trial." Marsland v. Pang , 5 Haw. App. 463, 475, 701 P.2d 175,
 
 
186 (1985) (citation omitted).
 
 
2
 
 A pleading may be dismissed under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6)
for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
 
 
However, it is well recognized that: 
 
[a] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the
plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her
claim that would entitle him or her to relief. We must
 therefore view a plaintiff's complaint in a light most
favorable to him or her in order to determine whether the
 allegations contained therein could warrant relief under any
alternative theory. For this reason, in reviewing a circuit
court's order dismissing a complaint our consideration is
strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint, and we
must deem those allegations to be true.
 
In re Estate of Rogers, 103 Hawai 'i 275, 280-81, 81 P.3d 1190, 
1195-96 (2003) (citations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). 
2 HRCP Rule 12(b) provides:
 
How Presented. Every defense, in law or fact, to a
claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim,
counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall
be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one
is required, except that the following defenses may at
the option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . (6)
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted[.] . . . If, on a motion asserting the defense
numbered (6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to
state a claim upon which relief can be granted,
matters outside the pleading are presented to and not
excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as
one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided
in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable
opportunity to present all material made pertinent to
such a motion by Rule 56.
 
3
  In her Counterclaim, Reyes-Toledo alleges that BOA's
 
 
conduct in commencing the foreclosure was willful, malicious, and
 
 
without just cause. Reyes-Toledo did not otherwise identify any
 
 
specific acts committed by BOA that would make the foreclosure
 
 
wrongful. 
 



 




 



 

 

 

 









	 

 

 Furthermore, 
[w]hile a complaint attacked by [an HRCP] Rule 12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual
 allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the
"grounds" of his "entitlement to relief" requires more than
labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the
elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual
 allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above
the speculative level on the assumption that all of the
complaint's allegations are true (even if doubtful in fact).
 
Pavsek v. Sandvold, 127 Hawai 'i 390, 403, 279 P.3d 55, 68 (App. 
2012) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555
 
(2007)).
 
1. Wrongful Foreclosure
 
The supreme court recently recognized certain potential
 
 
claims for wrongful foreclosure in Hungate v. Law Office of David
 
 
B. Rosen, 139 Hawai 'i 394, 407, 391 P.3d 1, 14 (2017). In 
Hungate, the supreme court articulated that "creating a cause of
 
 
action [against a foreclosing mortgagee's attorney] under former
 
 
HRS § 667-5[3] is not necessary to protect the interests of the
 
 
3 HRS § 667-5 was repealed by the legislature in 2012. 2012 Haw.
 
 
Sess. Laws Act 182, § 50 at 684. Prior to its repeal, HRS § 667-5 (Supp.
 
2008) provided: 
 
§667-5 Foreclosure under power of sale; notice;

affidavit after sale. (a) When a power of sale is contained
in a mortgage, and where the mortgagee, the mortgagee's
successor in interest, or any person authorized by the power
to act in the premises, desires to foreclose under power of
sale upon breach of a condition of the mortgage, the
mortgagee, successor, or person shall be represented by an
attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State and is
physically located in the State. The attorney shall:
(1) 	Give notice of the mortgagee's, successor's, or
(continued...)

 mortgagor" as "the mortgagor can protect its interest through
 
 
filing a claim against the mortgagee for wrongful foreclosure." 
 
Hungate, 139 Hawai 'i at 407, 391 P.3d at 14; see also Santiago v. 
Tanaka, 137 Hawai 'i 137, 158-59, 366 P.3d 612, 633-34 (2016) 
(recognizing that the nonjudicial foreclosure was wrongful and
 
 
that mortgagor was entitled to restitution). Furthermore, the
 
 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit noted that: 
 
3(...continued)
 
person's intention to foreclose the mortgage and of

the sale of the mortgaged property, by publication of
the notice once in each of three successive weeks
 (three publications), the last publication to be not
less than fourteen days before the day of sale, in a
newspaper having a general circulation in the county
in which the mortgaged property lies; and
(2)	 Give any notices and do all acts as are authorized or
required by the power contained in the mortgage.
(b)	 Copies of the notice required under subsection (a)
shall be:
 
(1) 	Filed with the state director of taxation; and
(2) 	Posted on the premises not less than twenty-one days
before the day of sale.
(c) Upon the request of any person entitled to notice
pursuant to this section and sections 667–5.5 and 667–6, the
attorney, the mortgagee, successor, or person represented by the
attorney shall disclose to the requestor the following
information:
 
(1) 	The amount to cure the default, together with the
estimated amount of the foreclosing mortgagee's
attorneys' fees and costs, and all other fees and
costs estimated to be incurred by the foreclosing
mortgagee related to the default prior to the auction
within five business days of the request; and
(2) 	The sale price of the mortgaged property once
auctioned.
 
(d) Any sale, of which notice has been given as aforesaid,
may be postponed from time to time by public announcement made by
the mortgagee or by some person acting on the mortgagee's behalf.
Upon request made by any person who is entitled to notice pursuant
to section 667–5.5 or 667–6, or this section, the mortgagee or
person acting on the mortgagee's behalf shall provide the date and
time of a postponed auction, or if the auction is cancelled,
information that the auction was cancelled. The mortgagee within
thirty days after selling the property in pursuance of the power,
shall file a copy of the notice of sale and the mortgagee's
affidavit, setting forth the mortgagee's acts in the premises
fully and particularly, in the bureau of conveyances.
(e) The affidavit and copy of the notice shall be recorded
and indexed by the registrar, in the manner provided in chapter
501 or 502, as the case may be.
(f) This section is inapplicable if the mortgagee is foreclosing
as to personal property only.

 6[in] states that have recognized substantive wrongful
foreclosure claims, . . . such claims typically are
available after foreclosure and are premised on allegations
that the borrower was not in default, or on procedural
issues that resulted in damages to the borrower. See, e.g.,
Ed Peters Jewelry Co., 124 F.3d at 263 n. 8 (noting that the
Massachusetts Supreme Court recognized a claim for wrongful
foreclosure where no default had occurred in Mechanics Nat'l
Bank of Worcester v. Killeen, 377 Mass. 100, 384 N.E.2d
1231, 1236 (1979)); Fields v. Millsap & Singer, P.C., 295
S.W.3d 567, 571 (Mo. Ct. App. 2009) (stating that "a
plaintiff seeking damages in a wrongful foreclosure action
must plead and prove that when the foreclosure proceeding
was begun, there was no default on its part that would give
rise to a right to foreclose" (internal alteration and
citation omitted)); Gregorakos v. Wells Fargo Nat'l Ass'n,
285 Ga. App. 744, 647 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2007) ("In Georgia, a
plaintiff asserting a claim of wrongful foreclosure must
establish a legal duty owed to it by the foreclosing party,
a breach of that duty, a causal connection between the
breach of that duty and the injury it sustained, and
damages." (internal quotation marks and alteration
omitted)); Collins v. Union Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 99 Nev.
284, 662 P.2d 610, 623 (1983) ("[T]he material issue of fact
in a wrongful foreclosure claim is whether the trustor was
in default when the power of sale was exercised."). 
Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 656 F.3d 1034, 1043-44
(9th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added).  
The instant case involves a pending judicial
foreclosure; in other words, Reyes-Toledo asserted her wrongful
foreclosure claim prior to any foreclosure or sale of the subject
property.  Reyes-Toledo fails to provide any authority, and we
find none, to support the proposition that a wrongful foreclosure
claim can be raised prior to foreclosure or the sale of the
property in a judicial foreclosure.  Thus, we conclude that she
could prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief
based on her wrongful foreclosure claim and the Circuit Court did
not err in dismissing the claim.  In re Estate of Rogers, 103
Hawai#i at 280-81, 81 P.3d at 1195-96. 
2.Declaratory Judgment
Reyes-Toledo alleged that she is entitled to
declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1 (2016).  In support of this 
 


 







 


 contention, Reyes-Toledo relies on Bain v. Metropolitan Mortgage
 
 
Group, Inc., 285 P.3d 34 (Wash. 2012), arguing that Bain
 
 
establishes that "MERS was just a registration system for

 
 
tracking ownership of the mortgages and was not a holder of the
 
 
promissory note[.]" However, this court has rejected a nearly
 
 
identical argument in Bank of America, N.A. v. Hermano, No. CAAP­
13-0006069, 2016 WL 3524547 at *3 (Haw. App. June 22, 2016)
 
 
(SDO), cert. denied, No. SCWC-13-0006069, 2016 WL 5231842 (Haw.
 
 
Sept. 22, 2016). This court articulated that:
 
 
Bain was decided in the context of a non-judicial
deed-of-trust foreclosure, whereas the instant case is a
judicial foreclosure of a mortgage. See Bain, 285 P.3d at
36. Thus, the procedures and law in Bain appear to be
inapplicable here. The Bain decision was limited to whether MERS is a "beneficiary"•under the language of Washington'sDeed of Trust Act, thus the analysis is different. Id.;Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 61.24.005 (West 2015). In addition,Bain is a Washington State case; upon review, we are notinclined to depart from the Hawai' i cases that have 
consistently recognized the validity of assignments ofmortgages by MERS where lenders granted to MERS, as nomineefor lenders and lenders' successors and assigns, the rightto exercise all of those interests granted by a borrower,including the right to foreclose and sell a property and totake any action required of a lender. See Bank of Am., N.A.v. Hill, 2015 WL 6739087 at *6-7; Andrade v. U.S. Bank Nat.
Ass'n, Civil No, 13-00255 LEK-KSC, 2013 WL 4552186 at *9-10
(D.Haw. Aug. 27, 2013); Camat v. Fed. Nat. Mortg. Ass'n,
Civil No. 12-00149 SOM/BMK, 2012 WL 2370201 at *1, *7-8 (D.
Haw. June 22, 2012); and Cooper v. Bank of New York Mellon,
Civil No. 11-00241 LEK-RLP, 2011 WL 3705058 at *13 (D. Haw,
Aug. 23, 2011).
 
Id. (footnote omitted). 
Here, MERS was listed in the Mortgage as "mortgagee"
 
 
and "nominee." The terms of the Mortgage granted MERS the right
 
 
to "exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not
 
 
limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property; and to
 
 
take any action required of Lender including, but not limited to,
 
 
releasing and canceling this Security Instrument." Therefore, we
 
 
conclude that Reyes-Toledo's argument is without merit and the
 
 
7
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 Circuit Court did not err when it dismissed Reyes-Toledo's
 declaratory judgment claim.
 
3. Quiet Title
 
A quiet title action "may be brought by any person 
against another person who claims, or who may claim adversely to the plaintiff, an estate or interest in real property, for the purpose of determining the adverse claim." HRS § 669-1 (2016). "In an action to quiet title, the burden is on the [quiet title] plaintiff to prove title in and to the land in dispute, and, absent such proof, it is unnecessary for the [quiet title] defendant to make any showing." Maui Land & Pineapple Co. v. 
Infiesto, 76 Hawai
'i 402, 407, 879 P.2d 507, 512 (1994) (citing 
State v. Zimring, 58 Haw. 106, 110, 566 P.2d 725, 729 (1977)). Moreover, "[w]hile it is not necessary for the [quiet title] plaintiff to have perfect title to establish a prima facie case, he must at least prove that he has a substantial interest in the property and that his title is superior to that of the [quiet title] defendants." Id. at 408, 879 P.2d at 513 (citing Shilts 
v. Young, 643 P.2d 686, 689 (Alaska 1981)). Thus, "[i]n order
 for mortgagors to quiet title against the mortgagee, the
 mortgagors must establish that they are the rightful owners of
 the property and they have paid, or are able to pay, the amount
 of their indebtedness." Bank of New York Mellon v. Mazerik, No.
 
CAAP-14-0001100, 2016 WL 6781379 at *4 (Haw. App. Nov. 16, 2016)
 (SDO), cert. denied, No. SCWC-14-0001100, 2017 WL 727873 (Haw.
 Feb. 24, 2017) (citing Caraang v. PNC Mortg., 795 F. Supp. 2d
 1098, 1126 (D. Haw. 2011)).

 Like the counterclaimant in Hermano, Reyes-Toledo
 
relies on Amina v. Bank of New York Mellon, 2012 WL 3283513 (D.
 Haw. Aug. 9, 2012), to support her contention that a "borrower
 does not need to tender payment to allege that the promissory
 note and mortgage were paid where the borrower brings a quiet
 title action against a party, who, according to the complaint, is
 not a mortgagee." However, as we pointed out in Hermano, this
 
contention ignores a significant clarification in Amina, which
 
provides: 
To be clear . . . this is not a case where Plaintiffs
 
assert that Defendant's mortgagee status is invalid (for
example, because the mortgage loan was securitized or
because Defendant does not hold the note). On their own,
such allegations would be insufficient to assert a quiet
title claim-they admit that a defendant is a mortgagee and
attack the weakness of the mortgagee's claim to the property
without establishing the strength and superiority of the
borrower's claim (by asserting an ability to tender).
 
Amina, 2012 WL 3283513 at *5; see Hermano, 2016 WL 3524547 at *4.
 
Here, Reyes-Toledo argued that BOA's mortgagee status
 
was invalid, and that the mortgage loan was securitized. Reyes-
Toledo also challenged BOA's possession of the Note. These
 circumstances were "specifically distinguished" in Amina. 
Hermano, 2016 WL 3524547 at *4. As such, Reyes-Toledo's reliance
 on Amina is misplaced. Reyes-Toledo's counterclaim does not
 allege that she paid, or was able to pay, the outstanding debt on
 her property so as to demonstrate the superiority of her claim. 
Mazerik, 2016 WL 6781379 at *5. Accordingly, we conclude that
 the Circuit Court did not err when it dismissed Reyes-Toledo's
 quiet title claim.

 4. UDAP
 
Under HRS § 480-2(a) (2008), "[u]nfair methods of 
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the 
conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful." Moreover, "[n]o person other than a consumer, the attorney general or the director of the office of consumer protection may bring an action based upon unfair or deceptive acts or practices declared unlawful by [HRS § 480-2]." HRS § 480-2. In order to assert a UDAP counterclaim, Reyes-Toledo must qualify as a "consumer" and the alleged unlawful conduct of BOA must involve "trade or commerce." Hungate, 139 Hawai
'i at 410, 391 P.3d at 17. The 
supreme court has held that "an individual who purchases residential property through acquiring a loan, i.e., a 'loan borrower' is a 'consumer' committing money in a personal investment within the meaning of HRS § 480-1." Hungate, 139 
Hawai
'i at 410, 391 P.3d at 17 (citation omitted). Reyes-Toledo 
is a "loan borrower" who purchased residential real estate, and thus, is a consumer under HRS § 480-2. See Hungate, 139 Hawai
'i 
at 410, 391 P.3d at 17. In addition, pursuant to Hawai 'i case 
law, BOA's conduct in consumer financial transactions, including in the context of foreclosure proceedings, occurred in trade or commerce, i.e. the business context, and therefore falls within the purview of UDAP. Id.; Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 
94 Hawai
'i 213, 227, 11 P.3d 1, 15 (2000). 
Thus, we turn to whether Reyes-Toledo alleged
 
sufficient facts that BOA engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or
 practices. A practice is "unfair when it offends established
 
10
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 public policy and when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers." Keka, 94 Hawai
'i at 228, 11 P.3d at 16 (citations 
omitted). "[A] deceptive act or practice is (1) a representation, omission, or practice that (2) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances where (3) the representation, omission, or practice is material." Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai
'i 254, 262, 141 P.3d 
427, 435 (2006) (citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Reyes-Toledo alleged in her counterclaim that she "paid
 
about $55,593 to [BOA] under the erroneous information, billings
 and assumption that [BOA] was the rightful owner of [her]
 mortgage loan." Reyes-Toledo also alleged, inter alia, that BOA
 was not the holder of the subject note at the time that the
 foreclosure complaint was filed and, therefore, BOA was not
 lawfully entitled to foreclose on the subject property. In light
 of the supreme court's decisions in Santiago, Hungate, and Reyes-
Toledo, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that Reyes-Toledo
 has failed to state a claim, under HRS chapter 480, upon which
 relief can be granted. Therefore, we necessarily conclude that
 the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Reyes-Toledo's UDAP claim
 pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6).
 
5. Reconsideration
 
Upon review of the record, Reyes-Toledo failed to
 
present any new evidence or arguments in conjunction with her
 motion for reconsideration that could not have been presented
 
11
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 during the earlier adjudicated motion to dismiss. See, e.g., 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 
Ltd., 100 Hawai 'i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002). Therefore, 
Reyes-Toledo is not entitled to any further relief based on her request for reconsideration of the Circuit Court's dismissal of her counterclaims. 
6. Conclusion
 
In accordance with the above, in addition to the relief
 
provided in the supreme court's opinion in Reyes-Toledo, the
 Circuit Court's Dismissal Order regarding Reyes-Toledo's
 counterclaims is affirmed in part and vacated in part. This case
 is remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings.
