Plaintiff-Appellant Therese Marie Wahl Saker (
Wife) 
appeals from: (1) the November 20, 2014 Order Denying Motion for 
Fees and Costs Under Hawai 'i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 68 
(Order Denying Rule 68 Motion) and (2) the February 19, 2015 
Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Denying 
Rule 68 Motion (Order Denying Reconsideration), in the Family

that the Family Court erred in denying her Rule 68 Motion, and 
her Motion for Reconsideration.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Wife's points of error as follows: 
(1) Wife contends that the Family Court erred in
 
denying her Rule 68 Motion.2   In particular, Wife challenges the
 
following Findings of Fact (FOFs) in the Family Court's March 17,
 
2015 FOFs, Conclusion of Law and Supplemental Record on Appeal: 
[FOF 5] : The Decree was arrived at by an agreement of
parties and there was no contested trial in this matter. 

[FOF 6]:  The Decree included a standard provision that
each party would be responsible for their own attorney's
fees and costs, subject to Rule 68 offers and claims. 
. . . . 

[FOF 8]:  In Nakasone v. Nakasone, 102 Hawai' i 177, 73
P.3d 715 (2003), the Hawaii Supreme Court stated that "By
entering into a stipulation of partial settlement, the
parties in effect resolved certain items out-of-court.
Accordingly, such items were removed from the operative
scope of Rule 68 and, to that extent, such matters became
uncontested. Because uncontested, the provisions of Rule 68
with respect to the not more favorable decree provision of
the rule would be inapplicable, along with the concomitant
 
2 At the time Wife made her Rule 68 offer, HFCR Rule 68 (2014)
provided: 

At any time more than 20 days before any contested
hearing held pursuant to HRS sections 571–11 to 14
(excluding law violations, criminal matters, and child
protection matters) is scheduled to begin, any party may
serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow a judgment to
be entered to the effect specified in the offer. Such offer
may be made as to all or some of the issues, such as custody
and visitation. Such offer shall not be filed with the
 court, unless it is accepted. If within 10 days after
service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice
that the offer is accepted, any party may then file the
offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of
service thereof and thereupon the court shall treat those
issues as uncontested. An offer not accepted shall be deemed
withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible, except in
a proceeding to determine costs and attorney's fees. If the
judgment in its entirety finally obtained by the offeree is
patently not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must
pay the costs, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred
after the making of the offer, unless the court shall
specifically determine that such would be inequitable in
accordance with the provisions of HRS section 580–47 or
other applicable statutes, as amended.

judicial authority to assess attorney's fees. Similarly, if
a stipulation of settlement as to such items resulted not
from Rule 68 exchanges but from an agreement outside the
Rule, then the attorney's fees provision of Rule 68 likewise
would be inoperative." 
[FOF 9]:
 Parties in this matter reached a complete

agreement on all issues. There was no contested hearing and
H.F.C.R.
 Rule 68 does not apply. 
Gordon Mark Saker (Husband) argues that under 
controlling Hawaii Supreme Court precedent, Nakasone v. Nakasone, 
"Rule 68 is unavailable as an avenue by which to obtain attorney's fees and costs if the parties to a divorce proceeding settle the disputed divorce issues prior to trial and the entry of the Divorce Decree." 
In Nakasone v. Nakasone, the respondent disagreed with 
parts of the petitioner's HFCR Rule 68 offer. 102 Hawai 'i 177, 
178, 73 P.3d 715, 716 (2003). Ultimately, the parties stipulated to certain issues, and the remaining issues were decided by the court. Id. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court recognized that "the 
purpose of HFCR Rule 68 is to encourage settlements prior to a contested matrimonial trial or hearing." Owens v. Owens, 104 
Hawai
'i 292, 309, 88 P.3d 664, 681 (App. 2004). It held that 
"matters in an offer of settlement made pursuant to [HFCR] Rule 68, which are initially rejected but later settled by agreement before trial, are not subject to an award of attorney's fees and costs under Rule 68." Nakasone, 102 Hawai
'i at 178, 73 P.3d at 
716. The supreme court explained in relevant part:
 
By entering into a stipulation of partial settlement, the
parties in effect resolved certain items out-of-court.
Accordingly, such items were removed from the operative
scope of Rule 68 and, to that extent, such matters became
"uncontested." Because uncontested, the provisions of Rule
68 with respect to the "not more favorable" decree provision
of the Rule would be inapplicable, along with the
concomitant judicial authority to assess attorney's fees.
Similarly, if a stipulation of settlement as to such items

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resulted not from Rule 68 exchanges but from an agreement
outside the Rule, then the attorney's fees provision of Rule
68 likewise would be inoperative. 
Inasmuch as the award of attorney's fees hinges on a
comparison of the offer with the decree or order finally
obtained by the offeree, the Rule does not contemplate an
award of attorney's fees if there is no decree or order
finally obtained by the offeree with respect to a subject
contained within the offer. Where the issue that had been
 the subject matter of a Rule 68 offer has been settled
pre-trial by the parties themselves, it is removed from
dispute in the proceedings and is thus no longer the subject
of an order "finally obtained" by the offeree. 
Id. at 181-82, 73 P.3d at 719-20. 
In the instant case, Wife made her HFCR Rule 68 offer
 
on November 14, 2011. Wife requested alimony in the amount of
 
$800.00 per month for forty-eight months. The offer provided
 
that "each party is responsible for his or her own attorney's
 
fees and costs incurred herein." Husband made his HFCR Rule 68
 
counteroffer on December 6, 2011. Husband did not agree with
 Wife's request for alimony and health care costs. 
On May 1, 2014, Wife and Husband reached a settlement
 
agreement.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Wife agreed to
 withdraw her request for alimony. Husband agreed to pay Wife
 
$40,000.00 as an "equalization payment" "to settle all
 outstanding property matters between the parties." Husband and
 Wife agreed that "[e]ach party is responsible for his or her own
 attorney's fees and costs incurred in this case, subject to Rule
 68 offers." The Family Court granted the Divorce Decree subject
 to the terms of the settlement agreement.
 
Wife contends that the phrase "subject to Rule 68
 
offers" indicates that the settlement agreement, and subsequent
 Divorce Decree did not "resolve the issues of HFCR Rule 68
 attorney's fees and costs." There is no support in the record
 
4   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that the issue of attorney's fees and costs would be resolved "by 
way of hearing" after the May 1, 2014 settlement conference. On the contrary, FOF 3 states that "[t]he Court conducted an extensive settlement conference and the parties placed a settlement agreement as to the entire divorce on the record on May 1, 2014." (Emphasis added). Wife did not challenge FOF 3, 
and thus, we are bound by this finding. State v. Kiese, 126 
Hawai
'i 494, 502, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188 (2012). We conclude that 
the settlement agreement resolved all disputed issues, including the issue of attorney's fees and costs. Since the settlement 
agreement resolved the issue of attorney's fees and costs, this 
issue is "removed from the operative scope of Rule 68[.]" Nakasone, 102 Hawai
'i at 181, 73 P.3d at 719. 
FOFs 5, 6, and 9 are supported by evidence in the 
record and thus, are not "clearly erroneous." In re Doe, 95 
Hawai'i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001). With regard to FOF 5, 
the Family Court determined that the "parties knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered into" the settlement agreement. Since the settlement agreement resolved all disputed issues, there was no contested trial. FOF 6 accurately reflects the provision in the Divorce Decree regarding attorney's fees and costs. With regard to FOF 9, the settlement agreement resolved 
the issue of attorney's fees and costs. As discussed, the 
resolution of this issue precluded recovery under HFCR Rule 68. Nakasone, 102 Hawai
'i at 181-82, 73 P.3d at 719-20. Although FOF 
8 should be deemed a conclusion of law, it merely reiterates the supreme court's reasoning in Nakasone.

Accordingly, we conclude that the Family Court did not
 
abuse its discretion when it denied Wife's Rule 68 Motion. Doe
 
v. Doe, 118 Hawai 'i 268, 278, 188 P.3d 782, 792 (App. 2008). 
(2) Wife contends that the Family Court erred in
 
denying her Motion for Reconsideration.
 
A motion for reconsideration is reviewed under the 
abuse of discretion standard. Cho v. State, 115 Hawai 'i 373, 
381, 168 P.3d 17, 25 (2007). An abuse of discretion occurs if 
the trial court has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992). Furthermore, the appellate courts have recognized that "the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated motion." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai
'i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 (2002) (citation omitted). 
In her Motion for Reconsideration, Wife stated that she
 
"does not submit new evidence or allege a change in law in the
 past five days, but asks that the Court reconsider a finding of
 'inequitable' when [Husband] submitted no actual evidence that
 would support a finding that it was more fair for [Wife] to pay
 the costs of her litigation from November 2011 to May 2014[.]" 
Wife failed to present any new evidence or arguments that could
 not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated Rule 68
 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Motion. Thus, the Family Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Wife's Motion for Reconsideration. 
For these reasons, the Family Court's November 20, 2014
 
Order Denying Rule 68 Motion, and February 19, 2015 Order Denying
 Reconsideration are affirmed.
