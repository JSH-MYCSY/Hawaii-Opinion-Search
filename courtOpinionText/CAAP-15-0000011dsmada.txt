APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0065)
 
ORDER DISMISSING THE APPEAL
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellant Lewis Edward
 
Graham, II (Graham), pro se, filed a notice of appeal on
 January 7, 2015; 
(2) Graham filed his opening brief on January 19, 2016;
 (3) On March 29, 2016, Plaintiff-Appellee Aurora Loan
 
Services (Aurora) filed its answering brief;
 
(4) There being no reply brief filed, this appeal was
 
placed on the ready calendar on May 17, 2016;
 
(5) On June 21, 2017, Aurora filed a suggestion of
 
death, stating that Graham had died on March 9, 2017 and that
 Thomas Yano, Esq. (Yano), was attorney for Graham;
 
(6) This court entered an Order on July 10, 2017,
 
directing the appellate clerk to conventionally serve Yano with a
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
copy of the order and that the parties, including Yano "shall
 
file position statements stating how the death of [Graham]
 affects this appeal" within fifteen days of the Order;
 
(7) On July 10, 2017, the appellate clerk mailed a copy
 
of this Order to Yano at KMPC, 4374 Kukui Grove St. Ste 204,
 Lihue, HI 96766; 
(8) On July 25, 2017, Aurora filed its position
 
statement, providing a copy of an obituary for Graham appearing
 in The Garden Island online publication and a copy of the circuit
 court's July 16, 2015 order approving Graham's former attorney,
 Rhonda M. Fosbinder's motion to withdraw as Graham's counsel; 
(9) Aurora also represented that it reviewed "the court
 
docket" and "found no indication that Graham or his estate is the
 subject of any pending actions other than this appeal, and Aurora
 has found no public record of the designation of personal
 representative for Graham;"
 
(10) On August 16, 2017, Yano filed his declaration
 
stating that he "was not retained to represent [Graham] in the
 instant appeal" and does not "presently know how [Graham's]
 Suggestion of Death will affect this appeal;"
 
(11)
 No one representing Graham's estate has moved to
 
substitute as a party for Graham in this action.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 21, 2017.
