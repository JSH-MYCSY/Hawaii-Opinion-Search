STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
HELEN T. GREEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(2DTA-13-01380)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Helen T. Green (Green) appeals from
 
the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment
 
(Judgment) entered on December 10, 2014, in the District Court of
 the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court).
1 After a
 
bench trial, the District Court found Green guilty of one count
 of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant
 (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­61(a)(1) (Supp. 2015).
2
 
On appeal, Green argues that the District Court erred
 
in admitting into evidence her Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)
 test results without a sufficient foundation. She argues in the
 alternative that the court abused its discretion in admitting the
 results as substantive evidence.

 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided. The Honorable Richard
 
Priest presided over the trial.

 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) provides, "A person commits the offense of
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle . . . [w]hile under
the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against
casualty[.]"

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Green's points of error as follows.
 
Even without the HGN test results there was 
overwhelming, compelling evidence to support Green's conviction. See State v. Kam, 134 Hawai
'i 280, 287, 339 P.3d 1081, 1088 (App. 
2014), aff'd, 137 Hawai 'i 161, 366 P.3d 636, No. SCWC-12-0000897, 
2016 WL 770253 (Haw. Feb. 25, 2016) (SDO); State v. Avilla, 127 Hawai
'i 3, 274 P.3d 1247, No. 30701, 2012 WL 1177103 at *1 
(App. Apr. 9, 2012) (SDO), vacated on other grounds in State v. Avilla, 131 Hawai
'i 300, 318 P.3d 590, No. SCWC-30701, 2014 WL 
537664, (Haw. Jan. 31, 2014) (SDO). Therefore, any error on the part of the District Court in admitting evidence of the HGN test results was harmless. See Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 
52(a); State v. Toyomura, 80 Hawai 'i 8, 27, 904 P.2d 893, 912 
(1995); State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai 'i 312, 320, 55 P.3d 276, 
284 (2002). 
Maui Police Department Officer Justin Mauliola (Officer
 
Mauliola) testified that he saw Green's vehicle drift or swerve
 over the solid white lines and nearly sideswipe a truck in the
 other northbound lane. The truck jerked to the right to avoid
 being hit. Green continued to drive for .2 miles after the
 officer activated his very prominent, blue, "wig-wag" lights and
 his siren, even though Green passed many areas where she could
 have pulled over. When Green pulled over, her vehicle quickly
 jerked across the outer lane, onto the shoulder area, nearly hit
 a guardrail, and jerked back to the left before making an abrupt
 stop. Officer Mauliola had to brake "pretty hard" to stop in
 time.
 
Officer Mauliola observed that Green's eyes were red,
 
watery, and bloodshot, her speech was slurred and mumbled, and
 there was an odor of alcohol on her breath. When Officer
 Mauliola asked Green for her driver's license, she handed him a
 credit card. As Green made her way from her car to the area
 where the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) were to be

conducted, she swayed back and forth and walked very slowly and
 
deliberately, as if to ensure her feet were touching the ground.
 
Green told Officer Mauliola she had not been injured
 
recently, was not seeing a doctor or taking medication, and had
 no issues with her head, neck, back, legs, or feet, or anything
 that would prevent her from walking in a straight line or
 standing on one foot. She complained of no medical or physical
 problems. She told the officer she was wearing contact lenses 
but did not say that they would affect her ability to perform the
 SFSTs.
 
As Green stood ready to take the HGN test, she leaned
 
forward. During the instructional phase of the Walk-and-Turn
 test, Green lost her balance three times and started early three
 times. During the walking phase of the test, she stepped off-
line twice each way; missed heel-to-toe connections on all nine
 steps going each way; raised her arms in a "T" fashion rather
 than keeping them down at her sides; and spun around when
 turning. Officer Mauliola was not able to get past the
 instructional phase of the One-Leg-Stand test because Green could
 not stand with her feet together without falling. After she made
 three failed attempts to stand with her feet together, the
 officer deemed it unsafe to continue.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of
 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea-Judgment, entered on
 December 10, 2014, in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Wailuku Division is affirmed.
