(4) On May 11, 2015, the appellate clerk notified 
Appellant, through Counsel, that the time for filing the 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court’s attention on May 21, 2015, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 30, and Appellant may request relief from default by motion; 
(5) On May 27, 2015, the court issued an order to show
 
cause to Counsel to explain why the appeal should not be
 dismissed for failure to file the opening brief, and why he
 failed to file a statement of jurisdiction or opening brief, or
 request an extension of time;
 
(6) Counsel responded that he began medical treatments
 
in December 2014, which interfered with his ability to work on
 the case;
 
(7) On October 18, 2016, the court took no further
 
action on the order to show cause, and granted Appellant relief
 from default and an extension of time for the statement of
 jurisdiction and opening brief to October 28, 2016, and November
 17, 2016, respectively. The court cautioned Appellant that any
 further default of the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief
 may result in the appeal being dismissed;
 
(8) Appellant took no further action and again
 
defaulted on the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief;
 
(9) The court subsequently learned that on January 1,
 
2016, Counsel voluntarily went on inactive status, although he
 did not withdraw from representing Appellant in this case;

(10) On December 8, 2016, the court ordered Appellant
 
to proceed pro se in this appeal, unless Appellant retained new
 
counsel and new counsel entered an appearance, or Appellant filed
 a motion or stipulation to dismiss the appeal. The court also
 extended the deadlines for the statement of jurisdiction and
 opening brief to January 9, 2017, and February 6, 2017,
 respectively, and cautioned Appellant that any further default of
 the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief may result in the
 appeal being dismissed. The court ordered the appellate clerk to
 serve the order on Appellant at the address listed in the record
 for the underlying case, Case No. 2DTA-13-00982;
 
(11) The appellate clerk complied with the December 8,
 
2016 order, and no return mail was received; and
 
(12) Appellant did not file the statement of
 
jurisdiction or opening brief, or request an extension of time
 for either document.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed, pursuant to HRAP Rule 30. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
serve this order on Appellant. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 14, 2017.
