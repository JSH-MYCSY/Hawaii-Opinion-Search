IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TIMOTHY A. AGLIAM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
 
(3DCW-14-0000696)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Timothy A. Agliam (Agliam) timely
 
appeals from the December 17, 2014 Judgment entered by the
 
District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo
 Division (District Court),
1
 convicting him of Endangering the
Welfare of a Minor in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-904 (2014)
2. On appeal, Agliam
 
argues that the District Court: (1) lacked subject matter
 jurisdiction over this case (2) erred in denying Agliam's motion
 to stay execution of his misdemeanor probation sentence pending
 appeal; and (3) erred in overruling Agliam's objections and
 admitting irrelevant and unduly prejudicial testimony.

 The Honorable Barbara T. Takase presided.

 HRS § 709-904(2) provides,
 
A person commits the offense of endangering the
welfare of a minor in the second degree if, being a parent,
guardian, or other person whether or not charged with the
care or custody of a minor, the person knowingly endangers
the minor's physical or mental welfare by violating or
interfering with any legal duty of care or protection owed
such minor.

Based on a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 
legal authority, we resolve Agliam's points on appeal as follows.
 
Agliam argues and the State concedes that the District 
Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has held that "[i]f a court lacks 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of a proceeding, any judgment rendered in that proceeding is invalid." Bush v. 
Hawaiian Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai
'i 128, 133, 870 P.2d 1272, 1277 
(1994). Furthermore, although "a lower court is found to have lacked jurisdiction, [the courts] have jurisdiction here on appeal, not of the merits, but for the purpose of correcting an error in jurisdiction." Casuga v. Blanco, 99 Hawai
'i 44, 49, 52 
P.3d 298, 303 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
On March 12, 2014, alleging certain acts committed by
 
Agliam against his son, the State charged Agliam with Endangering
 the Welfare of a Minor in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS
 § 709-904(2), by filing its complaint in the District Court of
 the Third Circuit. However, under HRS § 571-14(a) (Supp. 2015),
3
 
3	 HRS 571-14 (2006 and Supp. 2015) provides, in pertinent part,
 
§ 571-14 Jurisdiction; adults.  (a) Except as
provided in sections 603-21.5 and 604-8, the court shall
have exclusive original jurisdiction:
 
(1)	 To try any offense committed against a child by
the child's parent or guardian or by any other
person having the child's legal or physical
custody, and any violation of section 707-726,
707-727, 709-902, 709-903, 709-903.5, 709-904,
709-905, 709-906, or 302A-1135, whether or not
included in other provisions of this paragraph
or paragraph (2);
 
. . . .
 
In any case within paragraph (1) or (2), the court, in its
discretion, may waive its jurisdiction over the offense
charged.
 
. . . .
 
(b) The court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the
district court over violations of sections 707-712, 707-717,
707-722, 708-822, 708-823, 710-1010.5, 711-1106, and 711­1106.5 when multiple offenses are charged through complaint
or indictment and at least one offense is a violation of an
 order issued pursuant to chapter 586 or a violation of
section 709-906.

the Family Court has exclusive original jurisdiction "[t]o try an
 
offense committed against a child by the child's parent or
 guardian . . . and any violation of section . . . 709-904[.]" 
The record does not indicate that the Family Court waived its
 jurisdiction over the offense charged. Additionally, the
 District Court does not have concurrent jurisdiction with the
 Family Court over this matter. Thus, the District Court lacked
 subject matter jurisdiction.
 
Therefore, this case is remanded to the District Court
 
of the Third Circuit, North and South Hilo Division for dismissal
 of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
