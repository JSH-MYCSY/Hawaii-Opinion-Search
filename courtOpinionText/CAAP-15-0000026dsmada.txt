(5) On March 26, 2015, Bank Appellees filed a notice
 
indicating Appellant Rodillo M. Tabuyo filed a Chapter 7
 
bankruptcy case in the United States Bankruptcy Court on February
 28, 2015. The March 26, 2015 notice automatically stayed all
 proceedings in this appeal. 
See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) (2010);
 
HRAP Rule 54(c);
 
(6) 
On October 30, 2015, Bank Appellees filed a
 
certified copy of the bankruptcy court's June 24, 2015 notice of
 dismissal of Appellant Rodillo M. Tabuyo's bankruptcy case. The
 October 30, 2015 notice effectively terminated the bankruptcy
 stay. 
See HRAP Rule 54(b) & (c);
 
(7) Appellant did not pay the filing and docketing
 
fees, give security for costs, or take any further action in this
 appeal; and
 
(8) An appeal may also be dismissed where the record on
 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to
 proceed in forma pauperis. 
HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 9, 2015.
