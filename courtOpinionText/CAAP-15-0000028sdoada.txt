MICHAEL PLUMER, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KRYSTYN WARKUS, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. 09-1-0221)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Krystyn Warkus ( Warkus) appeals
from the December 15, 2014 Order Denying August 25, 2014 Motion
of Defendant Krystyn Warkus to Reconsider the Order Granting in
Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff's Motion for Award of
Attorney's Fees and Costs Entered Herein on August 13, 2014
(Order Denying Reconsideration ), filed in the Family Court of the
Fifth Circuit ( Family Court).1
Warkus raises three points of error on appeal, arguing
that:  (1) the Family Court abused its discretion when it entered
the Order Denying Reconsideration because fees were awarded based
on an offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68 of the Hawai #i FamilyNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Court Rules (HFCR) and the rule's standard of "patently not more
favorable than the offer" was not satisfied; (2) the Family Court
abused its discretion in entering the August 13, 2014 Order
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff's Motion for Award
of Attorney's Fees and Costs ( Order Awarding Fees ), which was the
subject of the Order Denying Reconsideration, because the HFCR
Rule 68 standard of "patently not more favorable than the offer"
was not satisfied and the Family Court did not make a finding
that the award of fees and costs would be equitable under the
provisions of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 580-47 (Supp. 2016);
and (3) the Family Court erred when it entered its April 13, 2012
Order Quashing Subpoenas and Awarding Attorneys Fees and Costs
(Order Quashing Subpoenas ).
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
resolve Warkus's points of error as follows:
(1 & 2)  In Cox v. Cox, 138 Hawai #i 476, 483, 382 P.3d
288, 295 (2016), the Hawai #i Supreme Court announced a new rule
as follows:  "because HFCR Rule 68 affects substantive rights of
parties in a divorce proceeding and it is in derogation of HRS
§ 580-47, we hold that HFCR Rule 68 is inapplicable to cases
governed by HRS § 580-47."  As Chief Justice Recktenwald
articulated in the dissent, "[t]his holding effectively
invalidates the rule in all divorce proceedings in this state." 
Id. at 490, 382 P.3d at 302.  In addition, the majority in Cox
specifically noted that its decision applies to all cases pendingNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2Plumer also argued that his fees and costs should be awarded
pursuant to HFCR Rule 11, but the Family Court denied his request for an award
based on this argument.
3on direct appeal at the time the decision was rendered, which
includes the case at bar.  Id. at 489 n.20, 382 P.3d at 301 n.20. 
Attorney's fees and costs were awarded to Plaintiff-
Appellee Michael Plumer ( Plumer) based on HFCR Rule 68, but in
his December 9, 2013 motion, Plumer argued that it would be
equitable to award him fees and costs under the circumstances of
this case and, in fact, it would be inequitable not to award his
attorney's fees and costs.2  In Cox, in addition to invalidating
HFCR Rule 68 in divorce cases, the supreme court held that, "in
cases within the purview of HRS § 580–47, requests for attorney's
fees and costs must be evaluated pursuant to the factors and
circumstances set forth in HRS § 580–47(a) and (f) in order to
determine that an award of such fees and costs is just and
equitable."  Cox, 138 Hawai# i at 483, 382 P.3d at 295.  Thus, we
vacate the Order Denying Reconsideration and, to the extent that
it awarded attorney's fees and costs based on HFCR Rule 68, the
Order Awarding Fees; and we remand the case to the Family Court
for consideration, as appropriate, of an award of fees and costs
under HRS § 580-47.  See id. at 490, 382 P.3d at 302.
(3)  Plumer argues that this court lacks appellate
jurisdiction to review the Order Quashing Subpoenas because
Warkus did not timely file a notice of appeal from that order
We agree.. 
The Order Quashing Subpoenas was a post-judgment order. 
It appears that once the order was entered on April 13, 2012 andNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4the subpoenas were quashed, the subject post-judgment proceedings
ended, and the Order Quashing Subpoenas was an appealable final
order.  See Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai #i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974,
978 (2003) (citation omitted) ("A post-judgment order is an
appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the
proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished."). 
Although, on April 23, 2012, Warkus timely filed a motion for
reconsideration of the Order Quashing Subpoenas, that motion was
denied in an order entered on July 31, 2012.  Even if we were to
consider the Order Quashing Subpoenas as part of a broader
ongoing post-decree proceeding, as Warkus urges, Warkus filed her
Motion for Relief from Divorce Decree pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3)
and (6) ( Rule 60 Motion ) on April 27, 2012 (after the entry of
the Order Quashing Subpoena).  The Rule 60 Motion was dismissed
by the Family Court in an order entered on September 25, 2013
(Order Dismissing Rule 60 Motion ), which was itself immediately
appealable.  See Ditto, 103 Hawai #i at 157, 80 P.3d at 978; see
also Familian Nw., Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd. , 68
Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937-38 (1986).  No tolling motion
was filed.  Warkus's January 14, 2015 Notice of Appeal was not
timely with respect to appellate review of the Order Quashing
Subpoena.
For these reasons, the Family Court's December 15, 2014
Order Denying Reconsideration and August 13, 2014 Order Awarding
Fees are vacated in part, as set forth above.  This case is
remanded to the Family Court for consideration, as appropriate,
of an award of fees and costs under HRS § 580-47.  Warkus'sNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
