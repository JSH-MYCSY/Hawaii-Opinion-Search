IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
TERI NGUYEN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
LAUREL YANAGI, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3RC14-1-493K)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
This appeal arises out of a complaint for damages
relating to the occupation of certain real property pursuant to a
lease agreement brought by the property's owner Plaintiff/
Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant Teri Nguyen, pro se, against the
lessee Defendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiff/Appellee Laurel Yanagi in
the District Court of the Third Circuit ("District Court").  The
District Court1/ directed the parties to arbitrate their case
pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement.  After issuance of
an arbitration award which found that both parties had breached
the terms of the lease and awarded no damages, the District Court
confirmed the award and issued a judgment.  Nguyen appeals from
the January 8, 2015 Judgment Based Upon Final Arbitration Award
Filed December 2, 2014 ("Judgment").  
We construe Nguyen's points of error2/ on appeal as
1/The Honorable Margaret K. Masunaga presided.
2/Nguyen's opening brief fails to adhere to the requirements of
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b) in numerous respects. 
Nonetheless, noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28 does not always result in
(continued...)NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
follows:
(1) The District Court lacked jurisdiction over the case.  
(2) The District Court erred in confirming the arbitration
award because:
(a) Yanagi failed to initiate arbitration pursuant to
the lease agreement. 
(b) the arbitration was unfair and occurred "behind
closed doors, without records, without minutes,
without witnesses, without transparency, under
protest." 
(c) the District Court, Yanagi, and Yanagi's attorney
failed to appear at the hearing on 12/23/14, at
8:30 am at the designated location. 
(3) Yanagi continues to commit criminal trespass and theft
on the property.
(4) Judge Masunaga should have been disqualified.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Nguyen's
contentions as follows and affirm.
(1) In support of her challenge to the District Court's
jurisdiction over the case despite what she contends is the
continued existence of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Nguyen provides an
assortment of quotations discussing how a judge loses judicial
immunity if he or she knowingly acts outside the scope of his or
her jurisdiction.  However, Nguyen does not provide any argument
addressing why the District Court lacked jurisdiction. 
Nevertheless, the District Court had jurisdiction to confirm the
arbitration award and then to issue the Judgment.3/

dismissal of the claims, and "[t]his court . . . has consistently adhered to
the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard
on the merits, where possible.'"  Morgan v. Planning Dep't , 104 Hawai #i 173,
180-81, 86 P.3 982, 989-90 (quoting O'Connor, 77 Hawai #i at 386, 885 P.2d at
364).  Therefore, we address Nguyen's arguments and contentions to the extent
that we can.
3/Hawai#i law confers jurisdiction on the court to enter judgment on
an arbitration award:
(continued...)
2NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
Hawaii appellate courts have held that claims
regarding state courts lacking subject matter jurisdiction over
the case premised upon the continuing existence of the Hawaiian
Kingdom are without merit.  In State v. Kaulia , for instance, the
Hawai#i Supreme Court stated:#
Kauli
a appears to argue that he is immune from the
court's jurisdiction because of the legitimacy of the Kingdom
government. In that regard, we reaffirm that "[w]hatever may
be said regarding the lawfulness" of its origins, "the State
of Hawai #i . . . is now, a lawful government." State v.
Fergerstrom , 106 Hawai #i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App.2004),
aff'd, 106 Hawai #i 41, 101 P.3d 225 (2004). Individuals
claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom and not of the State
are not exempt from application of the State's laws . See id.
at 55, 101 P.3d at 664  . . . .
128 Hawai #i 479, 487, 291 P.3d 377, 385 (2013) (emphasis added). 
We subsequently applied that same principle to a summary
possession and ejectment action.  Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass'n v.
Barros, No. CAAP-11-0001023, 2013 WL 3270302, at *1 (Hawai #i App.
June 25, 2013).  We can determine no reason that the principle
articulated in Kaulia does not apply to confirmation of
arbitration awards, particularly when the underlying action was
first brought in the district court by the party now challenging
the court's jurisdiction.  Therefore, the District Court had
jurisdiction over the confirmation of the arbitration award.  See
Kaulia, 128 Hawai# i at 487, 291 P.3d at 385.    
(2) We construe Nguyen's second point of error to
assert that the District Court erred in confirming the
arbitration award.  In support of her argument, Nguyen contends
that (1) Yanagi failed to initiate arbitration pursuant to the
lease agreement; (2) the arbitration was unfair and occurred
"behind closed doors, without records, without minutes, without
witnesses, without transparency, under protest."; and (3) the
District Court, the arbitrator, Yanagi, and Yanagi's attorney
"failed to appear at the hearing on 12/23/14, 8:30am at the
designated location."  Because Nguyen failed to move to vacate,
3/(...continued)
(b) An agreement to arbitrate providing for arbitration
in this State confers exclusive jurisdiction on the court to
enter judgment on an award under this chapter.

modify, or correct the arbitration award, she is precluded from
challenging confirmation of the arbitration award on appeal.
The Hawai #i appellate courts have held that,
[w]hen challenging an arbitration award on one of the grounds
set forth in HRS ยง 658A-23 (Supp. 2010) (Vacating Award), a
party must indeed file a timely motion to vacate under that
statute.  Otherwise, the right to appeal a confirmation order
and challenge it on any of the grounds under HRS ยง 658A-23 is
waived.
United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO v. Cty. Of
Hawaii-Holiday Pay (2003-002B) , 125 Hawai #i 476, 490, 264 P.3d
655, 669 (App. 2011) (citing Excelsior Lodge No. One v. Eyecor,
Ltd., 74 Haw. 210, 223-28, 847 P.2d 652, 658-60 (1992)
("considering statutes in predecessor HRS Chapter 658, a party
that failed to challenge an arbitration award in conformance with
statutes allowing for vacating, modifying or correcting an award
would be foreclosed from subsequently appealing a confirmation
order")).
Here, on December 8, 2014, Yanagi filed a motion for an
order confirming the arbitration award.  At no time did Nguyen
file a response to the motion or a motion to vacate, modify, or
correct the award.  On January 8, 2015, the District Court filed
an order granting the motion for an order confirming the
arbitration award, and explicitly noted "the lack of any
opposition from the Plaintiff[.]"  Thus, because Nguyen failed to
move to vacate, modify, or correct the arbitration award, she is
precluded from challenging the confirmation of the arbitration
award on appeal.  See Excelsior Lodge No. One, 74 Haw. at 223-28,
847 P.2d at 658-60.
Even if we concluded that Hawai# i's limited public
policy exception that allows parties to challenge arbitration
awards without first having contested them below, see Matter of
Hawai#i State Teachers Assoc., No. SCWC-11-0000065, 2017 WL
3471055, at *19 (Hawai# i Aug. 11, 2017) (quoting Inlandboatmen's
Union of the Pac. v. Sause Bros., 77 Hawai# i 187, 194, 881 P.2d
1255, 1262 (App. 1994)), would permit consideration of Nguyen's
contentions here, those contentions are nevertheless without
merit.  Nguyen asserts that Yanagi failed to initiate arbitration
pursuant to the lease agreement; that the arbitration was unfair
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
and "behind closed doors, without records, without minutes,
without witnesses, without transparency, [and] under protest";
and that Yanagi, her lawyer, the arbitrator, and the magistrate
"failed to appear at the hearing on 12/23/14, 8:30am at the
designated location[,]" but fails to establish any of her
complaints, or explain the consequence of those allegations. 
Additionally, we are unable to review any claim of unfairness
because there is no transcript of the arbitration hearing.  Any
contentions such as these for which arguments are not advanced
are deemed waived.  Haw. R. App. 28(b)(7).  Furthermore, the
majority of Nguyen's claims are either demonstrably false or
false in their implication, and of no apparent consequence.
Without a motion to vacate, modify, or correction
pending, the District Court was required to confirm the
arbitration award.  Haw. Rev. Stat. ยง 658A-22 ("the party may
make a motion to the court for an order confirming the award at
which time the court shall issue a confirming order unless the
award is modified or corrected pursuant to section 658A-20, 658A-
24 or is vacated pursuant to section 658A-23").  Therefore, the
District Court did not err in confirming the arbitration award. 
(3) Nguyen contends that the arbitrator and Yanagi's
attorney "allowed criminal trespass and theft by [Yanagi] to take
place during the course of arbitration on more than one occasion
despite 'Notice to Cease and Desist' and 'Motion to Stay
Judgment.'"  Nguyen fails to provide any argument to support her
contention, and thus this contention, too, is waived.  Kakinami
v. Kakinami , 127 Hawai #i 126, 144 n.16, 276 P.3d 695, 713 n.16
(2012).
Furthermore, to the extent that the contention refers
to infrastructure brought onto the property by Yanagi, it is
without merit.  As discussed above, Nguyen is precluded from
challenging the confirmation of the arbitration award because she
did not move to vacate the arbitration award.  See  Excelsior
Lodge No. One, 74 Haw. at 223-28, 847 P.2d at 658-60. 
Furthermore, the arbitration award states that "3.  The Lessee
brought certain infrastructure onto the property, including but
not limited to a lean to, a container, water tanks, fencing and
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
similar items.  The Lease has an interlineation which states that
'Any infrastructure placed by lessee is the property of lessee.'" 
Because the confirmation of the arbitration award is valid,
Yanagi as the lessee was entitled to remove the infrastructure
she placed on the property.  Accordingly, if not waived, Nguyen's
allegations of Yanagi's criminal trespass and theft are without
merit.             
(4) As her final point of error, Nguyen asserts that
Judge Masunaga should have been disqualified.  Nguyen, however,
failed to raise this issue below before the District Court,4/ and
it is therefore waived.  Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd. , 132
Hawai#i 333, 354 n.22, 322 P.3d 228, 249 n.22 (2014) (citing
State v. Moses , 102 Hawai #i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003)
("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at
trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal
[.]")).
Based on the foregoing, the January 8, 2015 Judgment
Based Upon Final Arbitration Award Filed December 2, 2014 entered
by the District Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 26, 2018.

4/After filing her Notice of Appeal and Trial by Common Law Grand
Jury on January 13, 2015, Nguyen filed an "Order to Disqualify Magistrate
Margaret Masunaga" with the District Court on February 10, 2015, based solely
on the contention that Judge Masunaga "does NOT have jurisdiction in this
Court of Record."  To the extent that this furthers Nguyen's jurisdictional
argument, addressed as her first point of error herein, we have already
concluded that the District Court had jurisdiction.  To the extent that it
represents anything else, we deem it waived for the failure to develop a
cognizable argument.
