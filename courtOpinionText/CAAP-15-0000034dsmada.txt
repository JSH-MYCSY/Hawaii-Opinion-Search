ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND

 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
 
(By: Foley and Fujise, JJ.,
with Leonard, J. dissenting)

 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack

 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Rosalyn H. Baker (Appellant Baker) has asserted from the
 Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's December 24, 2014 interlocutory
 order granting in part and denying in part Appellant Baker's
 motion to dismiss Plaintiff-Appellee Mark H.K. Greer's (Appellee
 Greer) complaint in Civil No. 14-1-2004-09 (the December 24, 2014
 interlocutory order), because the circuit court has not yet
 reduced its dispositive rulings in the December 24, 2014
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interlocutory order to a separate judgment document, as Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014) requires for an appeal from a civil circuit court case under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Appellant Baker asserts that the December 24, 2014 
interlocutory order is an appealable final order to the extent that it denies Appellant Baker's defense of legislative immunity based on a past holding in Abercrombie v. McClung, 54 Haw. 376, 507 P.2d 719 (1973). In Abercrombie v. McClung, a plaintiff sued a state senator for slander. The state senator filed a motion for summary judgment based on legislative immunity, and the circuit court entered an order denying the state senator's motion for summary judgment based on legislative immunity. The state senator appealed from the order denying summary judgment to the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i. When the plaintiff moved Supreme Court 
of Hawai 'i to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i denied the motion to 
dismiss and held, without referring to any specific statutory authority, that the circuit court's order denying the state senator's motion for summary judgment based on legislative immunity was an appealable final order: 
The appellee in his motion to dismiss appeal contends that
trial court's denial of motion for summary judgment is
interlocutory and that the appellant failed to seek and
obtain the consent of the trial court in pursuing the
instant appeal.
It is well established that under usual circumstances
 
a denial of a motion for summary judgment would be
interlocutory; however, it does not necessarily mean that
denial of the motion for summary judgment in this case is
therefore interlocutory. This court has repeatedly stated
that a final decision for the purpose of appeal is not
necessarily the last decision in the case, and that the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
nature and effect of the decision rather than the stage at
which it is rendered is the true test.
 
Abercrombie v. McClung, 54 Haw. 376, 380, 507 P.2d 719, 721
 
(1973) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis
 added).
 
Here, the trial court's denial of the motion for
summary judgment is final as to appellant's right to raise
the issue whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try
him for statements made by him as a member or our
legislature, in the light of our constitutional provision
reading no member of the legislature shall be held to answer
before any other tribunal.
We are mindful that causes should not be tried in
 
piecemeal fashion but where the question presented is a
question of the magnitude as herein, it is ridiculous to
resolve the question of law as to whether the appellant can
be held answerable before any other tribunal after he has
been subjected to trial. In the vernacular, it is placing
the cart before the horse. Considerable amount of time,
effort and money could very well be expended in a futile
ride on a legal merry-go-round.
 In seeking a just and
expeditious resolve and to meet the need of sparing the
litigants unnecessary expenditure of time, effort and money,
we conclude that the trial court's order denying appellant's
motion for summary judgment is an appealable final order.
 
Id. at 381, 507 P.2d at 722 (internal quotation marks omitted;
 
emphases added).
 
It is noteworthy, however, that the Abercrombie v.
 
McClung did not cite a any statutory authority in support of its
 holding regarding appellate jurisdiction, despite that under
 article III, section 1, and article IV, section 1, of the Hawai
'i 
Constitution, "the legislature has the power to establish the
 subject matter jurisdiction of our state court system." Sherman
 
v. Sawyer, 63 Haw. 55, 57, 621 P.2d 346, 348 (1980) (emphasis
 added); accord Tax Appeal of County of Maui v. KM Hawaii, Inc.,
 81 Hawai
'i 248, 254, 915 P.2d 1349, 1355 (1996). In light of 
this omission in Abercrombie v. McClung, one might infer that the
 Abercrombie v. McClung court was invoking the Supreme Court of
 Hawaii's exclusive supervisory power over all inferior courts
 
-3­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

under HRS § 602-4 (1993),  or the Supreme Court of Hawaii's
exclusive jurisdiction over certain enumerated appellate
 
proceedings under HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2014).2 Neither of these

 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 602-4 (1993) provides:
 
§ 602-4 Superintendence of inferior courts. The
 
supreme court shall have the general superintendence of all
courts of inferior jurisdiction to prevent and correct
errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly
provided by law.
 
(Emphasis added); see, e.g., State v. Harrison, 95 Hawai' i 28, 30, 18 P.3d
890, 892 (2001) (in which the Supreme Court of Hawai' i assumed jurisdiction
over an attorney's untimely post-judgment motion for court-appointed
attorney's fees by invoking its exclusive supervisory powers under HRS § 602-4
(1993)). HRS § 602-4 refers only to the Supreme Court of Hawai' i, and,
consequently, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has reiterated that "HRS § 602-4 .
. . applies only to this court[.]" Korean Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawai' i v.
 
Concerned Citizens, 107 Hawai' i 371, 382 n.8, 114 P.3d 113, 124 n.8 (2005).
No other court has supervisory power under HRS § 602-4.

 HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2014) provides:
 
§ 602-5 Jurisdiction and powers; filing. 
(a) The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and powers as
follows:
 (1)	 To hear and determine all questions of law, or of
mixed law and fact, which are properly brought before
it by application for a writ of certiorari to the
intermediate appellate court or by transfer as
provided in this chapter;
 
(2) 	To answer, in its discretion, any question of law
reserved by a circuit court, the land court, or the
tax appeal court, or any question or proposition of
law certified to it by a federal district or appellate
court if the supreme court shall so provide by rule;
 
(3) 	To exercise original jurisdiction in all questions
arising under writs directed to courts of inferior
jurisdiction and returnable before the supreme court,
or if the supreme court consents to receive the case
arising under writs of mandamus directed to public
officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their
offices; and such other original jurisdiction as may
be expressly conferred by law;
 
(4) 	To issue writs of habeas corpus, or orders to show
cause as provided by chapter 660, returnable before
the supreme court or a circuit court, and any justice
may issue writs of habeas corpus or such orders to
show cause, returnable as above stated;
 
(5) 	To make or issue any order or writ necessary or
appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction, and in such
case, any justice may issue a writ or an order to show
cause returnable before the supreme court; and

statutes confers appellate jurisdiction upon the Hawai 'i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
However, if one infers that the Abercrombie v. McClung 
court assumed appellate jurisdiction by invoking appellate 
jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), which does confer appellate jurisdiction upon the Hawai
'i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals, then one must also acknowledge that the law governing appeals under HRS § 641-1(a) has changed significantly since the year 1973, when the Abercrombie v. McClung court issued its holding. The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has subsequently noted 
that "the circuit courts are now governed by the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure." Wong v. Wong, 79 Hawai 'i 26, 29, 897 P.2d 953, 
956 (1995). The Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure are 
particularly relevant to HRS § 641-1, which expressly provides that appeals from appealable final judgments, orders or decrees of the circuit courts under HRS § 641-1(a) "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court." HRS § 641-1(c). In other words, HRS § 641-1(c) expressly authorizes the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i to promulgate rules that dictate the manner in 
which a party may appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a). In 1990, 
2(...continued)
(6) 	To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders and
mandates, issue such executions and other processes,
and do such other acts and take such other steps as
may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers
which are or shall be given to it by law or for the
promotion of justice in matters pending before it.
 
(b) All cases addressed to the jurisdiction of the
supreme court or of the intermediate appellate court shall
be filed with the clerk of the supreme court as provided by
the rules of court. The clerk shall maintain the record of
 each case whether addressed to the jurisdiction of the
supreme court or the jurisdiction of the intermediate
appellate court.
 
(Emphases added).
 
-5­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
seventeen years after the 1973 holding in Abercrombie v. McClung, 
the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i changed the manner in which a party 
may appeal from a circuit court civil case under HRS § 641-1(a) by amending HRCP Rule 58 with the so-called "separate document" rule that expressly requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. In 1994, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i provided its interpretation of the new 
separate document rule under HRCP Rule 58, explaining that "[t]he separate document provision was added to HRCP [Rule] 58 by order of this court on July 26, 1990[,] and has been generally ignored by practitioners and circuit courts alike." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 
115, 118, 869 P.2d 1334, 1337 (1994). Based on the new language in HRCP Rule 58 requiring the entry of a judgment as a separate document, the Jenkins court announced a new holding, namely that "[a]n appeal may be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. As the Supreme 
Court of Hawai 'i further clarified, "based on Jenkins and HRCP 
Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment." Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai
'i 245, 
254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). The Supreme Court of Hawai 'i 
explained that, in light of the fact that the separate document requirement was a significant departure from past requirements for perfecting a party's right to appeal from civil circuit court cases under HRS § 641-1(a), the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i would 
-6­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
enforce strict compliance with this new separate document
 
requirement under HRCP Rule 58 only with respect to notices of
 appeals that parties filed after March 31, 1994:
 
These holdings are intended to establish bright line
rules so there will be little doubt in most cases about when
 
an appeal may be taken. We realize that rigid enforcement of
HRCP [Rule] 58 and application of our holdings in this
opinion to cases currently pending before this court and the
Intermediate Court of Appeals would work an unnecessary
hardship on those who have relied upon our prior case law.
We will not rigidly apply the [HRCP] Rule 58 requirement of
a separate judgment or our holdings in this opinion to
appeals currently pending. However, for all appeals from
circuit courts filed after March 31, 1994, we will enforcestrict compliance with the separate document requirement of
HRCP [Rule] 58. Thus, after March 31, 1994[,] an appeal from
an order that purports to be a final order as to all claims
and parties in civil cases may be taken only after the order
has been reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the

parties. If claims are resolved by a series of orders, a
final judgment upon all the claims must be entered. The
"judgment shall not contain a recital of the pleadings,"
HRCP [Rule] 54(a), but it must, on its face, show finality
as to all claims against all parties. An appeal from an
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or
against the party by the time the record is filed in the
supreme court will be dismissed. If a judgment purports to
be certified under HRCP [Rule] 54(b), the necessary finding
of no just reason for delay . . . must be included in the
judgment.
 
Jenkins, 76 Hawai 'i at 119-20, 869 P.2d at 1338-39 (some citation 
and all footnotes omitted; emphases added). Therefore, the
 
holding in Jenkins implicitly overruled numerous prior opinions
 
that had directly or indirectly refrained from rigidly applying
 the separate document requirement to appeals from circuit court
 civil cases under HRS § 641-1(a). To the extent, if any, that
 one infers the Abercrombie v. McClung court assumed appellate
 jurisdiction pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), it appears that the
 subsequent holding in Jenkins has overruled Abercrombie v.
 McClung.
 
Under the holding in 
Jenkins, absent an appealable
 
final judgment, HRS § 641-1(a) does not entitle Appellant Baker
 to appellate review of the December 24, 2014 interlocutory order. 
-7­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The December 24, 2014 interlocutory order would qualify as an 
appealable final order only under an exception to the separate document rule under the doctrine in Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2014). However, the December 24, 2014 interlocutory order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b). See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (regarding the three requirements for the collateral order doctrine); see also Brown v. Wong, 71 Haw. 519, 523, 795 P.2d 283, 285 (1990) ("We hold that a pre-trial order denying a motion to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings or for summary judgment, on the basis of sovereign immunity, is not a collateral order, final in nature, and appealable in actions brought against the State under HRS Chapters 661 and 662. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal."); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). In fact, we note that on January 13, 2015, the circuit court clerk announced in court minutes that the circuit court would deny Appellant Baker's January 5, 2015 motion for leave to assert an interlocutory appeal from the December 24, 2014 interlocutory order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b), which, in turn, expressly provides that "[t]he refusal of the circuit court to allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or decree shall not be reviewable by any other court." 
-8­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Absent the entry of an appealable final judgment,
 
Appellant Baker's appeal from the December 24, 2014 interlocutory
 
order is a premature disruption in an ongoing circuit court case,
 and we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP
 Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
 
case number CAAP-15-0000034 is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in CAAP-15-0000034 are dismissed as moot.
