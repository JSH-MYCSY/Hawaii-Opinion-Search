(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the "Stipulation for Dismissal
 
With Prejudice of Appeal," filed June 16, 2015, by
 
Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellant Helen A. Eckert
 (Appellant), the papers in support, and the record, it appears
 that:
 
(1)
 The parties stipulate to dismiss the appeal with
 
prejudice, pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
42(b), with each party to bear its own costs and attorneys' fees;

(2) Appellant is represented by counsel, and counsel
 
signed the stipulation on her behalf;
 
(3) Appellant signed the stipulation on behalf of 
Defendant/Appellee Eckert Properties, LLC (Appellee Eckert 
Properties), but she is not an attorney licensed to practice law in Hawai
'i, and "non-attorney agents are not allowed to represent 
corporations in litigation." Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. 
v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 574
 (1979); see also HRS §§ 605-2 (1993) & 605-14 (Supp. 2014). 
Therefore, Appellant is not authorized to sign the stipulation on
 behalf of Appellee Eckert Properties;
 
(4) Under the circumstances, the court construes the
 
stipulation as Appellant's motion to dismiss the appeal; and
 
(5) Because counsel for the remaining parties, and the
 
remaining party proceeding pro se, each signed the stipulation to
 dismiss the appeal, the requested relief is unopposed.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to
 
dismiss the appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed with
 prejudice. The parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys'
 fees.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
