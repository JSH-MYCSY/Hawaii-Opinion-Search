that it lacked the authority to modify the terms of Dwayne and
 
Carolyn's Divorce Decree.
I. BACKGROUND
 
Dwayne and Carolyn were married on March 12, 1966. In
 
a Divorce Decree entered on October 28, 1993, the family court2
 
granted Dwayne and Carolyn a divorce and divided all of their
 property. The Divorce Decree provided:
 
b. Alimony. Beginning with a first payment on October
5, 1993, [Dwayne] shall pay to [Carolyn] the sum of $500.00
per month as and for alimony, such amount to be paid in two
equal insta11ments of $250.00 on the 5th and 20th days of
each month. Each payment of alimony shall be for the month
which begins on the due date of the payment.
 
Alimony shall continue each month until the happening
of the first of·  the death of [Carolyn], the death of
[Dwayne] or [Carolyn's] remarriage. [Carolyn] shall promptly
inform [Dwayne] of her remarriage.
 
c. Property Division.
 
. . . . 
(8) Retirement. [Dwayne] will be eligible for
retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement

 
System [(Dwayne's Pension)]. [Carolyn] is awarded fifty
percent (50%) of [Dwayne's] gross monthly annuity under the
U.S. Civil Service Retirement System benefits.

 
Dwayne was employed as a federal employee of the United
 
States Navy for approximately 47 years and retired on January 31,
 
2013. Dwayne's Pension from the Civil Service Retirement System
 began in October or November of 2013 and is his only source of
 income.
 
On April 14, 2014, Carolyn filed a "Motion and
 
Declaration for Post-Decree Relief," which sought to enforce the
 Divorce Decree's alimony award and collect past alimony arrears.
 Carolyn alleged that Dwayne did not pay her alimony as required
 under the terms of the Divorce Decree. On May 28, 2014, the
 family court granted Carolyn's request for alimony arrears and
 interest in the amount of $103,011.78.
3 The family court also

 The Honorable Patricia A. McManaman presided.

 On June 24, 2014, the family court entered its Judgment in favor of
Carolyn in the principal amount of $60,000 with statutory interest in the
amount of $43,011.78 for a total of $103,011.78.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ordered Dwayne "to continue to pay alimony of [$500] per month
 
unless and until a court order is entered to the contrary."
 
On June 13, 2014, Dwayne filed his own "Motion and
 
Declaration for Post-Decree Relief" (Dwayne's Post-Decree Relief
Motion), which sought to terminate his alimony obligation under
 
the Divorce Decree because he was now retired and Carolyn would
 
begin receiving half of Dwayne's Pension.
 
On July 10, 2014, Carolyn filed another "Motion and
 
Declaration for Post-Decree Relief" (Carolyn's July 2014 Post-
Decree Relief Motion), which sought an award of an additional
 
$500 in alimony for Dwayne's failure to pay alimony for the month
 
of June and enforcement of the family court's $103,011.78
 Judgment against Dwayne. Carolyn's July 2014 Post-Decree Relief
 Motion also requested the entry of an amended "Court Order
 Acceptable for Processing Under the Civil Service Retirement
 System" awarding her 60% of Dwayne's Pension, which would be a
 10% increase in her share of his benefit from the 50% awarded in
 the Divorce Decree. Alternatively, Carolyn requested the family
 court enter an order garnishing Dwayne's Pension to "the maximum
 monthly amount permitted by law" until Dwayne paid back the
 alimony arrears in full.
 
On August 13, 2014, the family court held a hearing on
 
Dwayne's Post-Decree Relief Motion and Carolyn's July 2014 Post-
Decree Relief Motion. At the hearing, the family court agreed to
 amend its prior Judgment to add an additional $500 for the June
 alimony payment that remained unpaid since the court's original
 Judgment. The family court also instructed both parties to file
 supplemental memorandums explaining whether the family court had
 the authority to modify the Divorce Decree or the authority to
 garnish Dwayne's Pension to satisfy the alimony arrears.
 
On the same day, the family court entered its written
 
order, which (1) granted Dwayne's Post-Decree Relief Motion by
 terminating his alimony obligation to Carolyn as of June 13, 2014
 and (2) awarded Carolyn an additional $500 in alimony that
 accrued prior to June 13, 2014. The family court also reiterated
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that the parties were to file and exchange supplemental
 
memorandums by August 22, 2014, "addressing (a) the jurisdiction
 of [the family court] to issue [a Court Order Acceptable For
 Processing] re: [Dwayne's Pension], and (b) the court's authority
 to garnish [Dwayne's] retirement by court order and [Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS)] § 651-124 [(Supp. 2015)]."
 
On October 1, 2014, the family court entered an Amended
 
Judgment adding $500 to the principal amount awarded to Carolyn,
 which thereby increased the total judgment for alimony arrears to
 $103,511.78. On October 27, 2014, after receiving supplemental
 briefing from both parties, the family court entered its Post-
Decree Order regarding Carolyn's July 2014 Post-Decree Relief
 Motion.
 
On November 17, 2014, Carolyn filed a "Motion for 
Reconsideration and for Entry of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" (Motion for Reconsideration), pursuant to Hawai
'i Family 
4
Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 59(e).  On December 29, 2014, the family
 
court entered its Order Denying Carolyn's Motion for
 Reconsideration. On January 13, 2015, Carolyn filed a notice of
 appeal.
 
On March 30, 2015, the family court entered its
 
"Findings of Fact and conclusions of Law Re: [Carolyn's] Motion
 and Declaration for Post Decree Relief Filed on July 10, 2014 and
 Motion for Reconsideration and for Entry of Findings of Fact and
 Conclusions of Law Filed on November 17, 2014," which concluded,
 
4 HFCR Rule 59(e) provides, in relevant part:
 
Rule 59.	 NEW TRIALS; RECONSIDERATION OR AMENDMENT OF
JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS.
 
. . . . 
(e) Motion to reconsider, alter or amend a judgment
or order. Except as otherwise provided by HRS section 571-54
regarding motions for reconsideration in proceedings based
upon HRS sections 571-11(1), (2), or (6), a motion to
reconsider, alter or amend a judgment or order is not
required but may be filed no later than 10 days after entry
of the judgment or order and shall be a non-hearing motion,
except that the court in its discretion may set any matter
for hearing.

5in relevant part:
3. The Court lacks the authority to modify the Divorce
Decree to increase [Carolyn's] share of [Dwayne's Pension]
or to issue an amended [Court Order Acceptable for
Processing] increasing [Carolyn's] share of [Dwayne's]
federal retirement benefits.
. . . . 
7. [Dwayne's] monthly benefit from the Civil Service
Retirement System are entirely exempt and cannot be attached
or garnished under HRS § 651-124.
8. While 5 CFR  §§ 581.101 and 581.103 [(Current through
Jan. 28, 2016)] enable the garnishment of federal retirement
benefits, they do not preempt HRS § 651-124 and do not
prohibit states from adopting statutes protecting retirement
from attachment, execution, garnishment, and any other legal
process.
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW
A.  Jurisdiction
It is axiomatic that we are "under an obligation to
ensure that [this appellate court has] jurisdiction to hear
and determine each case and to dismiss an appeal on our own
motion where we conclude we lack jurisdiction."  BDM, Inc.
v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 73, 549 P.2d 1147, 1148 (1976). 
"When we perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we
must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal."  Familian [Nw.],
Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369,
714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986).
Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co., 113 Hawai# i 406, 412, 153 P.3d 1091,
1097 (2007) (brackets and ellipsis in original omitted) (quoting
Bacon v. Karlin,  68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986)).
B.  Motion for Relief from Judgment or Order
In Beneficial Hawai #i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai# i 159, 45
P.3d 359 (2002), the Hawai# i Supreme Court stated that the
"circuit court's disposition of [a Hawai #i Rules of Civil
Procedure ( HRCP)] Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of
discretion."  Id. at 164, 45 P.3d at 364.  The supreme court
continued:
The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its
ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly
erroneous assessment of the evidence.  Stated
differently, an abuse of discretion occurs where the
trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.

III. DISCUSSION
 
Under HFCR Rule 59(e), a motion to reconsider, alter,
 
or amend a judgment or order must be filed "no later than 10 days
 
after entry of the judgment or order . . . ." HFCR Rule 59(e). 
The family court entered its Post-Decree Order denying Carolyn's
 July 2014 Post-Decree Relief Motion on October 27, 2014 and
 Carolyn filed her Motion for Reconsideration on November 17,
 2014. Carolyn's Motion for Reconsideration was, therefore,
 untimely under to HFCR Rule 59(e).
 
Although Carolyn invoked HFCR Rule 59(e) for her Motion
 
for Reconsideration, this court may treat her motion as a HRCP
 Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment or order as we
 determine the nature of a party's motion based on the motion's
 substance. See Anderson v. Oceanic Properties, Inc., 3 Haw. App.
 
350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617 (1982) ("[I]t is the substance of the
 pleading that controls, not its nomenclature." (citing Madden v.
 Madden, 43 Haw. 148, 149-50 (Haw. Terr. 1959)); see e.g., Ditto
 v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 974, 981 (2003) 
("[E]ven if the trial court lacked authority to grant Ditto's HRCP Rule 59 motion, the court had authority to hear Ditto's HRCP Rule 60(b) motion.").
5 
HRCP Rule 60(b) provides that a party may be relieved
 
from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following
 reasons:
 
Rule 60. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER
 
. . . .
 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud, etc.
 . . . .
 
5
 Carolyn's appeal from the family court's Post Decree Order was not
timely. Because Carolyn's motion for reconsideration under HFCR Rule 59(e)
was untimely, she did not extend the time to appeal under Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3). Moreover, Carolyn's appeal from thefamily court's October 27, 2014 Post-Decree Order was not timely under HRAPRule 4(a)(1). Under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1), a party must file an appeal to thiscourt within thirty days after the entry of judgment or the order appealedfrom. Because Carolyn failed to file her notice of appeal within thirty daysof when the family court entered its Post-Decree Order, this court does nothave jurisdiction over Carolyn's appeal of the Post-Decree Order.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
 
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b);
 
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or
extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party; 
(4) the judgment is void; 
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or 
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of
the judgment. 
(Format altered.) Carolyn's Motion for Reconsideration does not
 
provide a reason for why she should be relieved from the Post-
Decree Order, let alone a reason enumerated under HRCP Rule
 60(b). The family court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion
 in denying Carolyn's Motion for Reconsideration. 
See HRCP Rule
 
60(b).
 
In her arguments to the family court and on appeal, 

6
Carolyn assumes that HRS § 651-124  prohibits the garnishment of
6 HRS § 651-124 provides:
 
§ 651-124 Pension money exempt. The right of a debtor
to a pension, annuity, retirement or disability allowance,
death benefit, any optional benefit, or any other right
accrued or accruing under any retirement plan or arrangement
described in section 401(a), 401(k), 403(a), 403(b), 408,
408A, 409 (as in effect prior to January 1, 1984), 414(d),
or 414(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
or any fund created by the plan or arrangement, or any ABLE
savings account established pursuant to chapter 256B, shall
be exempt from attachment, execution, seizure, the operation
of bankruptcy or insolvency laws under 11 United States Code
section 522(b), or under any legal process whatever.
However, this section shall not apply to:
 
(1) 	A "qualified domestic relations order" as
defined in section 206(d) of the Employee
Retirement Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
in section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended; and
 
(2) 	Contributions made to a plan or arrangement
within the three years before the date a debtor
files for bankruptcy, whether voluntary or
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dwayne's Pension. Her only argument to the family court and on
 
appeal for why she should be entitled to garnish Dwayne's Pension
 is that HRS § 651-124 is preempted by federal law which permits
 garnishment of federal employee retirement benefits. 
It appears that contrary to Carolyn's assumption, HRS
 
§ 651-124(1) would permit the garnishment of Dwayne's Pension if
 the family court issued an appropriate order. While HRS § 651­124 generally exempts pension benefits from attachment,
 execution, and seizure, this exemption does not apply to a party
 that obtains a "'qualified domestic relations order' as
 defined . . . in section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of
 1986, as amended[.]" The referenced section 414(p) defines a
 "qualified domestic relations order" to include orders requiring
 distribution from a government plan, such as Dwayne's Pension,
 for alimony payments. See 26 U.S.C § 414(p)(1) and (11).
 
However, because Carolyn's only argument in support of 
her request to garnish Dwayne's Pension, both in the family court and on appeal, has been federal preemption, she has waived any claim based on HRS § 651-124(1). State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 
573, 584, 827 P.2d 648, 655 (1992) ("Our review of the record reveals that [the defendant] did not raise this argument at trial, and thus it is deemed to have been waived."); State v. Moses, 102 Hawai
'i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("As a 
general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal[.]"); HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). Carolyn's argument that she is entitled to garnish Dwayne's Pension because federal law preempted HRS § 651-124 is without merit. Accordingly, we decline to overturn the family court's Order Denying Carolyn's Motion for Reconsideration.

involuntary, or within three years before the
date a civil action is initiated against the
debtor, except for contributions to a retirement
plan established by state statute if the effect
would be to eliminate a state employee's
retirement service credit.

IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the
 
October 27, 2014 "Order Re: Motion and Declaration for Post-
Decree Relief, Filed July 10, 2014," and the appeal is dismissed
 in that regard. The December 29, 2014 "Order Re: Motion for
 Reconsideration and for Entry of Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 of Law, Filed on November 17, 2014," entered in the Family Court
 of the First Circuit, is affirmed.
