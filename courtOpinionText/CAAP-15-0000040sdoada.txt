STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 14-1-0017 (CR. NO. 94-1549))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant, Richard Star (Star) appeals from 
a December 15, 2014 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Illegal Sentence Through Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to [Hawai
'i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40" entered in the Circuit Court 
1
of the First Circuit  (circuit court).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Star's
 appeal is without merit.
 
On March 6, 1997, after holding a minimum term hearing,
 
the Hawaii Paroling Authority (HPA) issued a Notice and Order of

 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided.

Fixing Minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment setting Star's minimum 
term of imprisonment at 50 years, but did not set forth the level of punishment or the significant factors in determining the level of punishment. 
Star requested a new minimum sentence hearing after the 
2007 decision of Coulter v. State, 116 Hawai
'i 181, 172 P.3d 493 
(2007), which required the HPA to follow its own guidelines and list the level of punishment as well as the specific factors relied upon by the HPA in fixing the level of punishment. On March 27, 2014, a new minimum sentence hearing was held. The HPA reduced Star's minimum sentence to 40 years in a new Notice and Order Fixing minimum Term(s) of Imprisonment (2014 HPA Order). 
The 2014 HPA Order determined that level III punishment was 
appropriate and listed four major criteria as significant factors: (1) Nature of Offense, (2) Character and Attitude of Offender with Respect to Criminal Activity or Lifestyle, (3) Efforts Made to live Pro-Social Life Prior to Commitment to Prison, and (4) Involvement of Offender in Instant Offense. 
On April 30, 2014, HPA received a letter from Star
 
objecting to the criteria cited by the 2014 HPA Order and
 requesting a new minimum sentence hearing. On June 17, 2014,
 Star filed the petition at issue in this case requesting HPA
 grant him a new minimum sentence hearing. On June 19, 2014, HPA
 agreed to grant Star another hearing.
 
Since HPA granted Star's request for a new minimum
 
sentence hearing on June 19, 2014, just two days after Star filed

his petition requesting the same, Star's claims for relief became
 
moot.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set
 Aside, or Correct Illegal Sentence Through Writ of Habeas Corpus
 Pursuant to HRPP Rule 40," entered December 15, 2014 in the
 Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
