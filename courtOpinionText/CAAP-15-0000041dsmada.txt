ORDER
 
GRANTING PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE MCCULLY ASSOCIATES'
 
FEBRUARY 25, 2015 MOTION TO DISMISS APPELLATE COURT CASE
NUMBER CAAP-15-0000041 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DENYING ALL PENDING MOTIONS THEREIN AS MOOT
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee McCully
 
Associates' (McCully Associates') February 25, 2015 motion to
 
dismiss appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000041 for lack of
 appellate jurisdiction, and (2) the record, it appears that we
 lack appellate jurisdiction over Third-Party Defendant/Appellant
 Alexander Y. Marn's (Marn) appeal because Marn's January 23, 2015
 notice of appeal is a legal nullity.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Marn appeals from two documents:
 
(1) McCully Associates' January 7, 2015 notice of the
 pendency of action; and
 
(2) the Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura's February 11,
 2015 post-judgment order granting McCully
 Associates' January 6, 2015 post-judgment motion
 for a writ of execution.
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2014) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. In appellate court case number 30114, we affirmed the September 16, 2009 judgment in this case. Where, as here, post-judgment proceedings have taken place, "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai
'i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
McCully Associates' January 7, 2015 notice of the 
pendency of action is not a post-judgment order. A circuit court order granting or denying a motion to expunge a notice of pendency is an appealable order under the holdings in Knauer v. Foote, 101 Hawai
'i 81, 85, 63 P.3d 389, 393 (2003), and Canales 
v. Artiga, 118 Hawai 'i 421, 422, 192 P.3d 610, 611 (2008), but 
McCully Associates' January 7, 2015 notice of the pendency of action is not an appealable post-judgment order. 
Marn filed the January 23, 2015 notice of appeal prior 
to entry of the February 11, 2015 post-judgment order granting McCully Associates' motion for a writ of execution. Rule 4(a)(2) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) authorizes a 
premature notice of appeal, but only under specific circumstances. "If a notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal." HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) (emphasis added). In the instant case, Marn filed his January 23, 2015 notice of appeal before the circuit court's January 29, 2015 announcement that the circuit 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court intended to grant McCully Associates motion for a writ of 
execution. Consequently, Marn's January 23, 2015 notice of appeal in CAAP-15-0000041 is a legal nullity. See, e.g., 
Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 10, 13-14, 897 P.2d 937, 940-41 
(1995). 
Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to address the merits
 
in CAAP-15-0000041.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that McCully
 
Associates' February 25, 2015 motion to dismiss is granted, and
 CAAP-15-0000041 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in CAAP-15-0000041 are denied as moot.
