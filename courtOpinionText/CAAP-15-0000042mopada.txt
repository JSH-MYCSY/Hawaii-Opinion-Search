(CIVIL NO. 09-1-274K)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jennifer C. Trost (Trost) appeals
 
from the (1) "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion For Summary Judgment, and For
 Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties"
 (
FOFs/COLs) and (2) "Judgment" both entered on December 24, 2014
 
in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit1
 (circuit court).
 
On appeal, Trost contends the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment based on federal cases subsequently
 overturned on appeal.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Trost executed a promissory note (Note
) with Long Beach 
Mortgage Company (LBMC) secured by a mortgage on a property 
located in Kailua-Kona, Hawai 'i on May 24, 2006 (Mortgage). The 
1 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mortgage was recorded in the State of Hawai 'i Bureau of 
Conveyances on June 1, 2006. On October 27, 2008, LBMC assigned 
the Note and Mortgage to Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for Long Beach Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-6 (Deutsche Bank). 
In a letter dated January 14, 2009, Trost notified
 
Deutsche Bank that she is "exercis[ing] her right to cancel said
 referenced loan transaction and mortgage and promissory note of
 like consummation date, based upon numerous (1) false
 disclosures, (2) material nondisclosures, (3) unfair and
 deceptive acts and practices, (4) excessive charges, and (5) acts
 of fraud and misrepresentation throughout said loan transaction." 
On July 8, 2009, Deutsche Bank filed a complaint in
 
circuit court to foreclose on the Mortgage. On July 23, 2014,
 Deutsche Bank filed a "Motion For Summary Judgment, and For
 Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All Parties" (MSJ).
 
Trost filed her "Memorandum in Opposition to [Deutsche Bank's]
 
MSJ" (Opposition to Summary Judgment) on September 3, 2014.
 
On December 24, 2014, the circuit court entered its
 
FOFs/COLs and Judgment granting Deutsche Bank's MSJ. Trost filed
 her notice of appeal on January 23, 2015.
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Summary Judgment
 
[An appellate] court reviews a trial court's
grant of summary judgment de novo. O'ahu Transit 
Servs., Inc. v. Northfield Ins. Co., 107 Hawai' i 231,
234, 112 P.3d 717, 720 (2005). The standard for
granting a motion for summary judgment is wellsettled: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if
 proof of that fact would have the effect of
establishing or refuting one of the essential elements
of a cause of action or defense asserted by the
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party. In other
 words, [the appellate court] must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the
 light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai 'i 92, 104, 
176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). On a motion for summary judgment, "[a] 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties." Crichfield v. 
Grand Wailea Co., 93 Hawai
'i 477, 482-83, 6 P.3d 349, 354-55 
(2000) (citations omitted) (quoting Taylor v. Gov't Emps. Ins. Co., 90 Hawai
'i 302, 205, 978 P.2d 740, 743 (1999)). 
"[A] plaintiff-movant is not required to disprove 
affirmative defenses asserted by a defendant in order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment." U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. 
Castro, 131 Hawai
'i 28, 41, 313 P.3d 717, 730 (2013) (quoting 
GECC Fin. Corp. v. Jaffarian, 80 Hawai 'i 118, 119, 905 P.2d 624, 
625 (1995)). "Generally, the defendant has the burden of proof on all affirmative defenses, which includes the burden of proving facts which are essential to the asserted defense." Castro, 131 
Hawai
'i at 41, 313 P.3d at 730 (quoting GECC Fin. Corp. v. 
Jaffarian, 79 Hawai 'i 516, 526 n.3, 904 P.2d 530, 540 n.3 (App. 
1995) (Acoba, J., concurring)). 
[T]he moving party has the burden of producing support
for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material fact
exists with respect to the essential elements of the claim
or defense which the motion seeks to establish or which the
 motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed facts, it
is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Only
when the moving party satisfies its initial burden of
production does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to
respond to the motion for summary judgment and demonstrate
specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, that
present a genuine issue worthy of trial. 
French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai 'i 462, 470, 99 P.3d 
1046, 1054 (2004) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Jaffarian, 79 
Hawai'i at 521, 904 P.2d at 535).
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Truth in Lending Act (TILA)2
 
In Trost's Opposition to Summary Judgment she argued:
 
It is uncontested that Ms. Trost through counsel
timely sent a cancellation letter to her purported
mortgagee, rescinding her mortgage within the three-year
recission period for numerous TILA violations . . . which if
those material facts are established at trial, to which she
 
2 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
is now entitled, prevents foreclosure as a matter of federal
law.
 
While it is true that there is a split among Circuit
Courts in the federal system whether a borrower must also
file suit within the extended TILA three-year recission
period in addition to sending a letter of cancellation, that
issue has now been accepted for review by the United States
Supreme Court[.]
 
Attached to Trost's Opposition to Summary Judgment was her letter
 
notifying Deutsche Bank that she is "exercis[ing] her right to
 cancel said loan transaction and mortgage and promissory note of
 like consummation date[.]" The Mortgage was executed on May 24,
 2006. The letter notifying Deutsche Bank of Trost's intention to
 rescind the Mortgage is dated January 14, 2009, within three
 years of the consummation of the Mortgage.
 
The circuit court issued its FOFs/COLs and Judgment on
 
December 24, 2014, having made no findings or conclusions
 regarding Deutsche Bank's TILA defense.
 
On January 13, 2015, the United States Supreme Court
 
answered the question of "whether a borrower exercises [the right
 to rescind certain loans for up to three years after a
 transaction is consummated under the TILA] by providing written
 notice to his lender, or whether he must also file a lawsuit
 before the 3-year period elapses." Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home
 
Loans, Inc., 135 S.Ct. 790, 791 (2015). The Supreme Court held,
 "so long as the borrower notifies within three years after the
 transaction is consummated, his recission is timely. The statute
 does not also require him to sue within three years." Id. at
 
792. In order to exercise the right to rescind under TILA, a
 
borrower must merely provide written notice of their intention to
 rescind within three years of the consummation of their loan. 
Id. at 793.
 
Trost preserved her right to rescind the Mortgage with
 
Deutsche Bank because her letter notifying Deutsche Bank of her
 intention to do so was timely under TILA. Trost's letter was
 sent within three years of the consummation of the Mortgage. The
 circuit court did not include in its FOFs/COLs a decision on
 whether Trost had timely preserved her right to rescind under
 TILA. We must answer whether this omission by the circuit court
 was harmless error in light of the circuit court's grant of
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Deutsche Bank's MSJ. If Trost was required to provide evidence
 
of facts essential to her affirmative defense and has not done
 so, then the circuit court's error was harmless.
 
In her Opposition to Summary Judgment, Trost failed to
 
make any argument or provide evidence to support her claim that
 Deutsche Bank engaged in "(1) false disclosures, (2) material
 nondisclosures, (3) unfair and deceptive acts and practices, (4)
 excessive charges, and (5) acts of fraud and misrepresentation
 throughout said loan transaction." In order to survive summary
 judgment, Trost must have provided facts demonstrating that
 Deutsche Bank failed to satisfy TILA's disclosure requirements. 
See Jesinoski, 135 S.Ct. at 792 ("[TILA] grants borrowers an
 unconditional right to rescind for three days, after which they
 may rescind only if the lender failed to satisfy the Act's
 disclosure requirements."). Because Trost failed to provide any
 evidence that Deutsche Bank did not comply with TILA, Trost has
 failed to meet her burden of proof at the summary judgment stage
 for this affirmative defense. Therefore, the circuit court's
 failure to address Trost's TILA defense was harmless error.
 
B. Standing
 
On appeal, Trost argues that In re Mortgage Electronic
 
Registration Systems, Inc., 555 Fed. Appx. 661 (9th Cir. 2015)
 
(MERS Litigation) created a new rule under which the circuit
 
court's decision that Deutsche Bank had standing is erroneous.

In MERS Litigation, however, the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial
 
court's dismissal of a plaintiff-debtor's claim that MERS
 violated former Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-5 (1993)
 
because the plaintiff-debtor had "plausibly alleged that MERS was
 
neither the mortgagee, nor the mortgagee's successor in interest,
 nor authorized by the power to act in the premises, because [the
 plaintiff's] lender's bankruptcy terminated MERS' status as the
 
3 Trost's opening brief cites to In re Mortgage Electronic Registration
Systems (MERS) Litigation, Nos. CV 10-01547-PHX-JAT, MD 09-02119-PHX-JAT, 2015
WL 3465816 (D. Ariz. June 1, 2015), which relies on the Ninth Circuit
decision. Because Trost's argument relies on the substance of the Ninth
Circuit and not the subsequent federal district court case, we discuss the
impact of the Ninth Circuit decision on Trost's appeal.

lender's nominee under the power of sale." MERS Litigation, 555
 
Fed. Appx. at 664 (citations omitted). 
Here, however, Trost challenges the circuit court's
 
grant of Deutsche Bank's MSJ in a judicial foreclosure action,
 
not the dismissal of a cause of action for violating HRS § 667-5. 
Therefore, MERS Litigation is not dispositive of this case. 
Moreover, Trost did not provide any admissible evidence to
 counter Deutsch Bank's evidence that it holds the note and
 mortgage in this case. In sum, Trost's argument that MERS
 Litigation requires reversal of the circuit court's grant of
 Deutsche Bank's MSJ is without merit.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the (1) December 24, 2014 "Findings of Fact;
 
Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion For Summary
 Judgment, and For Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Against All
 Parties" and (2) December 24, 2014 "Judgment" both entered in the
 Circuit Court of the Third Circuit are affirmed.
