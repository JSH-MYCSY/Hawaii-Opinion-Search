IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JULIAN MANCE, aka Julian M. Mance, and
Julian Marcus Mance, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 2DCW-14-0001497)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Plaintiff-Appellant Julian Marcus Mance appeals from a
 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order ("Judgment"), entered on
 
January 2, 2015, in the District Court of the Second Circuit,
 Wailuku Division ("District Court").
1 The District Court
 
convicted Mance of Harassment, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 Statutes ("HRS") § 711-1106(1)(b).
2 On appeal, Mance argues that
 
1/
 The Honorable Adrianne N. Heely presided.
 
2/
 HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) (2014) provides in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if,
with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person,
that person:
 
. . . .
 
(b)	 Insults, taunts, or challenges another person in
a manner likely to provoke an immediate violent
response or that would cause the other person to
reasonably believe that the actor intends to
cause bodily injury to the recipient or
another[.]
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the District Court erred in convicting him based on evidence that
 
was insufficient to enable a person of reasonable caution to
 reach a conclusion that he insulted, taunted or challenged the
 complaining witness ("CW") with the intent to harass, annoy or
 alarm her, in a manner likely to either provoke her immediate
 violent response or cause her to reasonably believe that he
 intended to cause her bodily injury. Mance asks that we vacate
 the Judgment and reverse the conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, we resolve
 Mance's points of error as follows, and affirm.
 
"When a conviction is challenged based on the 
sufficiency of the evidence, the test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt" or whether we might have decided differently if presented with what we understand to be the same facts, "but whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Griffin, 126 Hawai
'i 40, 56, 266 P.3d 448, 464 
(App. 2011) (quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 
1227, 1241 (1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Substantial evidence is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. (internal quotation marks 
and ellipsis omitted). Thus, "even if it could be said . . . that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as there is [credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to make] the requisite findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed." State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 
61 (1996) (quoting State v. Pone, 78 Hawai 'i 262, 265, 892 P.2d 
455, 458 (1995)). 
To prove that Mance harassed the CW, Plaintiff-Appellee 
State of Hawai 'i had to show that Mance, (i) "with intent to 
harass, annoy, or alarm" the CW, (ii) "[i]nsult[ed], taunt[ed], or challenge[d]" the CW (iii) "in a manner . . . that would cause 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
[the CW] to reasonably believe that [Mance] intend[ed] to cause
 
[her] bodily injury . . . ." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1106(1)(b). 
On appeal, Mance appears to challenge the District Court's ruling
 for two reasons. First, Mance argues that the District Court's
 apparent conclusion that he intended to cause bodily harm was
 wrong because it directly conflicted with the court's finding
 that "[h]e had no intent to cause bodily harm." Upon review of
 the court's findings as a whole, however, it is clear that the
 court merely summarized Mance's own testimony that he did not
 intend to cause bodily harm in the finding that Mance cites. The
 record demonstrates that this summary accurately reflects Mance's
 words, so we leave it undisturbed. 
Second, Mance appears to argue that the District Court 
failed to make a required finding that he had the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm the CW. Based on the evidence adduced at trial as to Mance's "acts, conduct, and . . . all the circumstances" of the event in question, however, we disagree. State v. Stocker, 90 Hawai
'i 85, 92, 976 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) 
(quoting State v. Mitsuda, 86 Hawai 'i 37, 44, 947 P.2d 349, 356 
(1997)). For example, Cindy Manzano, an outreach worker at the Family Life Center ("Center"), where the incident in question took place, testified about circumstances of the incident. Manzano recalled that Mance, a Center client, looked agitated when he entered the facility on June 4, 2014.
3 As to Mance's 
conduct, the CW, who is also an outreach worker at the Center and who served Mance's food that day, testified that when she handed Mance's pizza to him across the two-foot-wide counter, he said "FU, B-I-T-C-H" to her. According to Manzano, who overheard Mance's epithet, Mance clearly had not been talking to her, so Manzano guessed that Mance must have been speaking to the CW, who was the only other person working in the area at the time.
4 The 
3/
 Maui Police Officer Taylor Kamakawiwo' ole also testified that 
Mance appeared a little "agitated" and "worked up" when Officer Kamakawiwo' ole 
arrived on the scene. 
4/
 At the time of the incident, Mance, who was about six feet, three
or four inches tall, also admitted to making the comment within earshot of the
CW (although he contended that he had been speaking to someone else at the
time).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
CW and Manzano's testimony thus sufficiently support the court's 
finding that Mance directed a threatening statement towards the CW. See Griffin, 126 Hawai
'i at 56, 266 P.3d at 464. 
Furthermore, despite Mance's emphasis on the fact that 
he did not step towards the CW, lunge at her, extend his hands toward her, nor ball his fists or swing at her, it was the District Court's perogative as fact finder to determine the credibility of the witnesses, to weigh the evidence, and to make all reasonable and rational inferences therefrom. State v. 
Mitchell, 94 Hawai
'i 388, 393, 15 P.3d 314, 319 (App. 2000) 
(citing State v. Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. 448, 457, 877 P.2d 891, 895 (1994)). The CW testified that she was "frightened" by Mance's actions and "scared" because she thought he was going to come back and "it was going to get worse and worse." In fact, after confronting the CW and Manzano, Mance proceeded to the Center's front office, "and started an uproar there, using the same language." Front office personnel asked Manzano to leave and, together with the CW, decided to call 911. In light of the CW's credible testimony, the circumstances surrounding the incident, the fact that the CW and Mance had previously had a "very close" relationship, and the CW's "shaken" demeanor when police officers arrived at the scene, there was sufficient evidence that Mance acted in a manner that would cause the CW to reasonably believe that Mance intended to cause her bodily injury. 
Because "the mind of an alleged offender may be read 
from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances[,]" Stocker, 90 Hawai
'i at 92, 976 P.2d at 406 
(quoting Mitsuda, 86 Hawai 'i at 44, 947 P.2d at 356), the above-
summarized trial testimony–when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, Griffin, 126 Hawai
'i at 56, 266 P.3d at 
464 (quoting Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i at 135, 913 P.2d at 61)), also 
supports the inference that Mance acted with the "intent to harass, annoy, or alarm" the CW, Haw. Rev. Stat. § 711-1106(1). As such, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Mance's conviction.
