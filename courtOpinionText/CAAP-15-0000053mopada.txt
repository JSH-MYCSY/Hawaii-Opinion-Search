IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
LANRIC HYLAND and ALEX ACHMAT, Petitioners-Appellants,
v.
 
RONALD GONZALES and STEWART MAEDA, in his official
capacity as Hawai 'i County Clerk, Respondents-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE COUNTY OF HAWAI 'I BOARD OF REGISTRATION
 
(APPEAL NO. 14-01)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this appeal of an administrative agency decision, 
Petitioners-Appellants Lanric Hyland (Hyland) and Alex Achmat 
(Achmat) (together, Appellants) appeal from the "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Dismissing Appeals" (FOF/COL), 
issued by the Board of Registration, County of Hawai 'i (Board) 
and dated January 9, 2015. 
On appeal, Appellants contend:
 
(1) the Board erred when it held, "[Appellants'] appeal
 
was not 'filed' on October 14, 2014, after service by registered
 mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the Board where the Board
 itself instructed Appellants to mail it";
 
(2) the Board erred when it "told [Appellants] to mail
 
the appeal to the Office of State Elections in Pearl City, HI and
 gave no Big Island physical locus for the chairman of the board";
 
(3) the Board erred when it "made no mention in its
 
[FOF/COL] that [Appellants] mailed their appeal to the Office of
 State Elections in Pearl City, Hawaii on October 14, 2014 by
 registered mail, postage prepaid";
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) the Board erred when it "refused to deal with
 
Appellants' challenge on the merits"; and
 
(5) "[t]he County Clerk erred when on 5-21-14 he
 
refused to declare Ronald S. Gonzales' 4-1-14 voter registration
 
form null and void on it's [sic] face."
I. BACKGROUND
 
Respondent-Appellee Ronald Gonzales (Gonzales) was a 
candidate in the Hawai 'i County Council District 9 race in the 
2014 election cycle. On August 1, 2014, Respondent-Appellee Stewart Maeda, in his official capacity as County Clerk of Hawai
'i (County Clerk), received a challenge to Gonzales' voter 
registration residence from Petitioner Joe Appleton (Appleton). 
On August 14, 2014, the County Clerk received an additional 
challenge to Gonzales' voter registration residence from Petitioner Matthew Binder (Binder) and Achmat. The County Clerk 
reported that he received a third challenge from Hyland, but that 
Hyland subsequently withdrew his request.
1 
While only Hyland and Achmat are parties to this 
appeal, Hyland, Appleton, Binder, and Achmat are collectively referred to as the "Challengers." In a decision dated October 1, 2014, the County Clerk determined, based on the evidence presented, that Gonzales sufficiently established a Waikoloa residence for voter registration purposes. The County Clerk notified the Challengers in the written decision that pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 11-26 (2009 Repl.) and Hawaii 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 3-172-43 (2010), they had the "right 
to appeal [the County Clerk's] decision to the [Board] within 10 
days of the service of this decision." The County Clerk's decision was mailed to the Challengers on October 2, 2014.
2 
The Challengers then submitted a letter to the Board
 
appealing the County Clerk's decision (Appeal Letter). The
 
1
 Hyland contends that he reinstated the challenge prior to the
County Clerk's decision and, therefore, was also a proper party to the
subsequent appeal to the Board.
 
2
 The record on appeal indicates that on October 2, 2014, the County
Clerk sent its decision to Binder by registered mail with a request for a
return receipt, and an envelope addressed to Hyland, post-marked October 2,
2014, was sent by the standard United States Postal Service.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Challengers contended that "[t]his appeal is . . . timely filed
 
if postmarked by October 16, 2014." The Appeal Letter was dated
 October 14, 2014, but the Office of the Elections' file stamp was
 dated October 16, 2014.
 
On October 29, 2014, Gonzales filed an objection to the
 
Board's jurisdiction over the Challengers' appeal (Jurisdiction
 
Objection). Gonzales argued that the appeal was untimely under
 
3
HRS § 11-26  because the deadline for filing the appeal was
October 14, 2014. Hyland submitted a reply to Gonzales'
 
Jurisdiction Objection, dated October 31, 2014 (Reply to
Jurisdiction Objection).
 
The Board scheduled a prehearing conference on November
 
1, 2014 "to simplify and clarify the issues and discuss the
 
procedures to hear the appeal of [the Challengers.]"4 During the
 
hearing, Gonzales, through his representative at the hearing,
 argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear Hyland's
 complaint because Hyland could not "resurrect" his challenge to
 
5
Gonzales' residency after his challenge was withdrawn.  Gonzales
also argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction because the
 Challengers' appeal of the County Clerk's decision to the Board
 was untimely. 
The Board ultimately determined that Hyland could
 
remain a party to the appeal, but concluded that the Challengers'
 appeal was indeed untimely.
 
On January 9, 2015, the Board issued its FOF/COL and
 
found:
 
3 HRS § 11-26(b) provides in relevant part: 
§11-26 Appeal from ruling on challenge;
or failure of clerk to act. . . . . 
(b) . . . The appeal shall be brought
within ten days of the service ofthe adverse decision. 
4 Hyland appeared at the hearing pro se and purported to represent
Appleton. Achmat and Binder also made appearances at the prehearing, but
Hyland indicated that he was not representing the other challengers.
 
5
 Unlike Gonzales, the County Clerk's office did not take a position
on whether Hyland had standing to appeal. Instead, the County Clerk's Office
maintained that Hyland's request to reinstate his complaint was not timely
because by the time Hyland "reinvoked his challenge" the County Clerk's
"decision had already been authored."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
11. County Clerk Maeda's October 1, 2014 decision,
concluding that Mr. Gonzales resides in District 9 was
mailed to [the Challengers] on October 2, 2014, as indicated
by its postmark.
 
12. Ten days after October 2, 2014 was October 12,
2014 which fell on Sunday. Monday, October 13, 2014, was
Discoverer's Day, a holiday. The next day was Tuesday
October 14, 2014, and the last day by which [the
Challengers] could timely file an appeal.
 
13. [The Challengers] filed appeals with the Board on
October 16, 2014.
 
The Board further concluded:
 
6. Pursuant to [HRS] § 11-26(b), ten days from the
service of the decision on October 2, 2014 was October 12,
2014, which fell on a Sunday.
 
. . . .
 
8. Pursuant to [HRS] § 1-29 [(2009 Repl.)], Sunday and
Monday, which was a holiday, are excluded from the
computation of time and any appeal of the clerk's decision
had to be filed by the next day, Tuesday October 14, 2014.
[The Challengers] filed their appeals on October 16, 2014;
the appeals are untimely.
 
9. As the appeals were untimely filed, the Board lacks
jurisdiction over the appeals.
 
On January 29, 2015, Appellants filed a notice of
 
appeal to this court.6
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
An agency's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, while
an agency's factual findings are reviewed for clear error. A
conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of fact and
law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because
the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances
of the particular case. 
As a general matter, a finding of fact or a mixed
determination of law and fact is clearly erroneous when (1)
the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding
or determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to
support the finding or determination, the appellate court is
left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake
 has been made. Substantial evidence is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable
a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard." Hiraga, 121 Hawai
'i at 312, 219 P.3d 
at 1099 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Captain Andy's Sailing, Inc. v. Dep't of Land and Nat. Res., State of Hawai
'i, 113 Hawai 'i 184, 192, 150 P.3d 833, 841 (2006)).
III. DISCUSSION
 
Appellants contend the Board erred in concluding their 
appeal of the County Clerk's decision was untimely.7 HAR § 3­
172-43(a) provides that "[a]ny appeal of the clerk's ruling shall be made in writing by filing a notice of appeal with the chairperson of the [Board] within ten days of service of the clerk's decision." This court has determined that "[t]he common understanding of the word 'file' means to 'deliver a legal document to the court clerk or record custodian for placement into the official record.'" Si-Nor, Inc. v. Dir., Dep't of Labor 
& Indus. Relations, 120 Hawai
'i 135, 149, 202 P.3d 596, 610 (App. 
2009) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 660 (8th ed. 2004)); see also United States v. Lombardo, 36 S.Ct. 508, 509 (1916) ("'Shall file' means to deliver to the office, and not send through the United States mails." (citing Gates v. State, 28 N.E. 373 (N.Y. 1891)); In re Bryan, 261 B.R. 240, 244 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2001) ("A 'filing' occurs when papers are delivered to the actual custody of a proper officer."). Furthermore, HRS § 11-26(b) instructs that service of a County Clerk's adverse decision "shall be made personally or by registered mail, which shall be deemed complete upon deposit in the mails, postage prepaid, and addressed to the aggrieved person's last known address." Thus, in order for Appellants' appeal to be timely, Appellants were required to deliver their Appeal Letter to the Board within ten days of when 
7
 Appellants also attempt to argue that the Board was required to
provide them with a Big Island location at which they could file their appeal
from the County Clerk's decision. Appellants' opening brief, however, failsto identify any legal authority for their contention that the Board wasrequired to provide them with an alternate location and, therefore, we deemAppellants' argument waived. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule
28(b)(7) (providing that an appellant's opening brief must include "[t]heargument, containing the contentions of the appellant on the points presentedand the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes andparts of the record relied on. . . . Points not argued may be deemed waived."(Emphasis added.)). 
5
  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the County Clerk properly mailed his adverse decision to them.8
 
The record indicates the County Clerk mailed his
 
adverse decision to Appellants on October 2, 2014, as evidenced
 
by a copy of a registered mail envelope dated October 2, 2014
 addressed to Binder and the envelope post-marked October 2, 2014
 addressed to Hyland. Thus, the ten day time period began to run
 on October 3, 2014, the day after the County Clerk served his
 adverse decision. See HRS § 1-29 (2009). Because October 12,
 
2014, the tenth day, was a Sunday, the deadline for Appellants to
 file their appeal was the following Monday, October 13, 2014.
9
 
See id. Appellants' appeal was not filed until October 16, 2014,
 
so their appeal from the County Clerk's decision was untimely.10
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law
 
8
 In Gonzales' Jurisdiction Objection and Hyland's Reply to
Jurisdiction Objection, both parties appeared to believe that Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 6(e)--which provides an additional two days for
the filing of a response when the triggering event is served by mail--addedtwo days to Appellants' appeal deadline so to give Appellants a total oftwelve days to file their appeal. We note that because we are tasked with determining the computation of time for an administrative proceeding, the HRCPrules do not apply. See HRCP Rule 1 ("These rules govern the procedure in the
circuit courts of the State in all suits of a civil nature whether cognizableas cases at law or in equity[.]"). The rules that govern computation of timefor appeals from election related decisions do not provide for a two day mailrule, therefore, Appellants were required to submit their appeal within theten days proscribed under HAR § 3-172-43(a) and HRS § 11-26(b). See also HRS 
§ 1-29, which provides: 
9
 HRS § 8-1 (2009 Repl.) lists the recognized state holidays and
states the list of holidays includes "[a]ny day designated by proclamation by
the President of the United States or by the governor as a holiday." The
 Board determined the deadline for Appellants to file their appeal was October
14, 2014 because October 13, 2014 was "Discovers' Day" and, therefore,
constituted a holiday. See HRS § 1-29 (excluding the last day from
computation of time if it is a holiday). Not only is "Discovers' Day" not
listed as a state holiday under HRS § 8-1, but HRS § 8-1.5 (2009 Repl.)
specifically provides that "[t]he second Monday in October shall be known as
Discoverers' Day, in recognition of the Polynesian discoverers of the Hawaiian
Islands, provided that this day is not and shall not be construed to be a
state holiday." (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, on October 10, 2014,
President Barack Obama recognized October 13, 2014 as "Columbus Day" but did
not designate the day a national holiday. See The Proclamation No. 9193, 79
Fed Reg. 62301 (Oct. 10, 2014) ("Columbus Day, 2014"). Therefore, the Board
erred in concluding that October 13, 2014 was a holiday that tolled
Appellants' appeal deadline to October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, given that
Appellants' appeal would have been untimely under the appropriate October 13,
2014 deadline as well, we hold that the Board's error was harmless.
 
10
 Because we hold the Board had no jurisdiction to consider the
Appellants' appeal from the County Clerk's decision, we need not address
Appellants' remaining points on appeal.
