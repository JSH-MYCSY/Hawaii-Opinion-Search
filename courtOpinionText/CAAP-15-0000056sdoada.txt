AA, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
HILO DIVISION

 
(FC-D NO. 13-1-238)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
This consolidated appeal1/ arises from a divorce
 
between Plaintiff-Appellant AA ("Father"), pro se, and Defendant-
Appellee AA ("Mother"), pro se, and a dispute over the custody of
 their four minor children (collectively, the "Children"). Father
 appeals from the January 2, 2015 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 Law and Decision of the Court ("FOF/COL") that was issued by the
 Family Court of the Third Circuit ("Family Court").
2/ We
 
construe the appeal to stem from the February 4, 2015 Divorce
 Decree ("Divorce Decree"), which incorporates the FOF/COL, and in
 which the Family Court dissolved Mother and Father's marriage and
 awarded sole legal and physical custody of the Children to
 Mother, subject to Father's right to supervised visitation
 consistent with the emotional and therapeutic needs of the
 Children. We further construe Father's opening brief to contend

that the Family Court abused its discretion when it awarded
 
Mother sole legal and physical custody of the Children.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments they advance, the issues they raise, and the
 relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Father's point of
 error as follows, and affirm:
3/
 
Father essentially asserts that the Family Court abused
 
its discretion in awarding Mother sole legal and physical custody
 of the Children. Father cites to Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S.
 645 (1972), the United States Constitution, and the Bill of
 Rights. In Stanley, the United States Supreme Court held that
 under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
 U.S. Constitution, an unwed father was entitled to a hearing on his fitness as a parent before his children could be taken from him in a dependency proceeding. Id. at 658. Stanley is 
inapposite here, however, as Father was given many hearings and a trial to determine his entitlement to custody of the Children. Further, if Father intends to argue something other than a failure of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, he does not provide any argument in his opening brief explaining the application of his objection based on the U.S. Constitution or the Bill of Rights. Therefore, these contentions are waived on appeal. Kakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai
'i 126, 144 n.16, 276 
P.3d 695, 713 n.16 (2012). 
Father fails to provide transcripts of hearings

 
relevant to his claims on appeal and fails to show an abuse of
 discretion on the part of the Family Court. "The burden is upon
 
3/
 Father's opening brief fails to adhere to the requirements of
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b) in several respects,
including Father's failure to provide a concise statement of the case, or any
references to the record, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(3); Father's failureto provide points of error, citation of legal authority, and cogent arguments,as required by HRAP 28(b)(4) & (b)(7); and attaching documents to his openingbrief that are not part of the record on appeal, in violation of HRAP28(b)(10). Nonetheless, noncompliance with HRAP Rule 28 does not alwaysresult in dismissal of the claims, and "[t]his court . . . has consistentlyadhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their
cases heard on the merits, where possible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dep't, Cty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai' i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. 
Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994)).
Therefore, we proceed to address Father's points and arguments to the extent
that we are able.

appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in 
the record, and he [or she] has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984)). "The law is clear in this jurisdiction that the appellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." Id. 
Transcripts are not always necessary for appellate review, if "it is possible to determine that the court erred without recourse to the transcript." Thomas-Yukimura v. Yukimura, 130 Hawai
'i 1, 10 
n.19, 304 P.3d 1182, 1191 n.19 (2013). Such a determination is not possible here. We cannot conclude from the record on appeal and Father's opening brief that Father has met his burden to demonstrate error. Accordingly, we affirm the Family Court's custody decision. 
Based on the foregoing, the January 2, 2015 Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision of the Court, and the
 February 4, 2015 Divorce Decree entered by the Family Court of
 the Third Circuit are affirmed.
