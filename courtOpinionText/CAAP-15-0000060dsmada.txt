OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES LLC, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MARILYN O. HERRERA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 1RC14-1-3414)

 
ORDER
 
DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
AND
 
DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS IN CAAP-15-0000060 AS MOOT

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Marilyn O.
 
Herrera's (Appellant Herrera) appeal from district court Civil
 No. 1RC14-1-3413, because Plaintiff-Appellee Portfolio Recovery
 Associates, LLC's (Appellee Portfolio Recovery Associates),
 January 8, 2015 motion for summary judgment as to Appellee
 Portfolio Recovery Associates' complaint is still pending
 disposition. 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellant Herrera is appealing pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2014).
 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts. In district court
 
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies. . . . A final order means an order ending the
proceeding, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. . .
 . When a written judgment, order, or decree ends the
litigation by fully deciding all rights and liabilities of
all parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated, the
judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The separate judgment document rule under Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is 
not applicable to district court cases. Consequently, an
order that fully disposes of an action in the district court
may be final and appealable without the entry of judgment on
a separate document, as long as the appealed order ends the
litigation by fully deciding the rights and liabilities of
all parties and leaves nothing further to be adjudicated.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i at 427, 984 P.2d at 1253 
(emphases added). The final order or final judgment in a 
district court case must be in writing.  Rule 4(a)(5) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that "[a] judgment 
or order is entered when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the court." Consequently, a district court's "oral decision is not an appealable order." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i 73, 
77, 110 P.3d 397, 401 (2005). Although the court minutes might reflect a trial court's oral announcement of a ruling, "a minute order is not an appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, 
Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 
(1998) (emphasis added). "In civil cases before the district 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court, the filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk 
constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry." KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai
'i at 
77, 110 P.3d at 401 (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). 
On April 1, 2015, the district court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for appellate court case number CAAP-15-0000060,
 at which time the record on appeal did not contain any written
 order or judgment that adjudicates Appellee Portfolio Recovery
 Associates's January 8, 2015 motion for summary judgment. Absent
 the entry of an appealable final order or final judgment,
 Appellant Herrera's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-15-0000060 is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions
 
in CAAP-15-0000060 are dismissed as moot.
