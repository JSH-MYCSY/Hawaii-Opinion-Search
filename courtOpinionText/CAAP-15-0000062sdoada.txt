IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
 
SUNG SIG HWANG, Defendant-Appellant.
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
 
HONOLULU DIVISION

 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-14-00481)
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
After a bench-trial, the District Court of the First
 
 
1

Circuit (District Court)  found Defendant-Appellant Sung Sig
 
 
Hwang (Hwang) guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence
 
 
of an intoxicant (OVUII). The District Court entered its
 
 
Judgment on February 4, 2015. 
 
On appeal, Hwang argues that his OVUII conviction must 
be vacated because the District Court failed to give him the 
warnings regarding his right to testify that were mandated by the Hawai
'i Supreme Court in Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 
P.2d 1293 (1995). We agree. 
The record shows that after the prosecution rested, the
 
District Court failed to address the subject of Hwang's right to
 testify with Hwang and failed to give Hwang the advisements

required by Tachibana. Tachibana, 79 Hawai 'i at 236 & n.7, 900 
P.2d at 1303 & n.7. Hwang did not testify, and we cannot say 
that the District Court's error in failing to comply with Tachibana was harmless. See State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai
'i 271, 279, 
12 P.3d 371, 379 (App. 2000). 
Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's Judgment
 
and remand the case for a new trial.
